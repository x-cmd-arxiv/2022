(GW) emission has reopened the exciting possibility that dark matter is made,
at least partly, of primordial black holes (PBHs). However, this scenario is
challenged by many observational probes that set bounds on the relative PBH
abundance across a broad range of viable PBH masses. Among these bounds, the
ones coming from microlensing surveys lead to the strongest constraints in the
mass range from $\sim 10^{-10}$ to a few M$_{\odot}$. The upper part of this
range precisely corresponds to the mass window inside which the formation of
PBHs should be boosted due to the QCD phase transition in the early Universe,
which makes the microlensing probes particularly important. However, it has
been argued that taking into account the inevitable clustering of PBH on small
scales can significantly relax or entirely remove these bounds. While the
impact of PBH clustering on the GW event rate has been studied in detail, its
impact on the microlensing event rate has not yet been fully assessed. In this
Letter, we address this issue, and show that clusters arising from isocurvature
perturbations, that originating from PBHs formed from Gaussian initial
curvature perturbations, do not alter the current microlensing constraints, as
they are not sufficiently compact.

ability of feature representation for tracking. Specifically, having observed
that de facto frameworks perform feature matching simply using the outputs from

module to the backbone network, especially the shallow layers. More concretely,
only the matching module can directly access the target information (in the
reference frame), while the representation learning of candidate frame is blind
to the reference target. As a consequence, the accumulation effect of
target-irrelevant interference in the shallow stages may degrade the feature
quality of deeper layers. In this paper, we approach the problem from a
different angle by conducting multiple branch-wise interactions inside the
Siamese-like backbone networks (InBN). At the core of InBN is a general
interaction modeler (GIM) that injects the prior knowledge of reference image
to different stages of the backbone network, leading to better
target-perception and robust distractor-resistance of candidate feature
representation with negligible computation cost. The proposed GIM module and
InBN mechanism are general and applicable to different backbone types including
CNN and Transformer for improvements, as evidenced by our extensive experiments
on multiple benchmarks. In particular, the CNN version (based on SiamCAR)
improves the baseline with 3.2/6.9 absolute gains of SUC on LaSOT/TNL2K,

handle the probabilistic time limitations. Considering that DC programming is
dependent on a good initial point, we propose a second method that relies on
only convex programming, which eliminates the dependence on user-defined

outperforms the former in terms of energy efficiency and run-time.

transition during which the stress relaxes towards a so-called \textit{residual
stress} $\sigma_{\rm res}$ that tallies a macroscopic signature of previous
shear history. Here, we report on the liquid-to-solid transition in gels of
boehmite, an aluminum oxide, that shows a remarkable non-monotonic stress
relaxation towards a residual stress $\sigma_{\rm res}(\dot\gamma_{p})$
characterized by a dual behavior relative to a critical value $\dot\gamma_{c}$
of the shear rate $\dot\gamma_{p}$. Following shear at
$\dot\gamma_{p}>\dot\gamma_{c}$, the gel obtained upon flow cessation is
insensitive to shear history, and the residual stress is negligible. However,
for $\dot\gamma_{p}<\dot\gamma_{c}$, the gel encodes some memory of the shear
history, and $\sigma_{\rm res}$ increases for decreasing shear rate, directly
contributing to reinforcing the gel viscoelastic properties. Moreover, we show
that both $\sigma_{\rm res}$ and the gel viscoelastic properties increase
logarithmically with the strain accumulated during the shear period preceding
flow cessation. Such a shear-induced ""overaging"" phenomenon bears great

generic pMSSM models. We first revisit the bounds on the gluino mass placed by
the ATLAS collaboration using the $1l + jets + \met$ data. We show that the
exclusion region in the $M_{\widetilde{g}}-M_{\widetilde{\chi}^0_1}$ plane in
the pMSSM scenario sensitively depends on the mass hierarchy between the left

lesser extent, other parameters. Most importantly, for higgsino type lighter
electroweakinos (except for the LSP), the bound on the gluino mass from this

ATLAS $jets + \met$ data, fairly strong limits are regained. Thus in the pMSSM
an analysis involving a small number of channels may provide more reliable mass
limits. We have also performed detailed analyses on neutralino dark matter (DM)
constraints in the models we have studied and have found that for a significant
range of LSP masses, the relic density constraints from the WMAP/PLANCK data
are satisfied and LSP-gluino coannihilation plays an important role in relic
density production. We have also checked the simultaneous compatibility of the

information about the fundamental nature of gravity, but extracting that
information can be difficult. One popular technique is the parametrized
inspiral test of general relativity (a realization of the parametrized
post-Einsteinian framework), where the gravitational waveform, as calculated in
Einstein's theory as a series expansion in the orbital velocity, is
parametrically deformed at a given set of orders in velocity. However, most
current approaches usually only analyze the data while considering a single,
specific modification at a time. Are then constraints placed with a single
modification robust to our ignorance of higher post-Newtonian order
corrections? We show here that for a wide class of theories, specifically those
that admit a post-Newtonian expansion, single-parameter tests are indeed
robust. In particular, through a series of full Bayesian parameter estimation
studies on several different sets of synthetic data, we show that
single-parameter constraints are not degraded but rather are improved by the
inclusion of multiple parameters, provided one includes information about the
mathematical structure of the series. We then exemplify this with a specific
theory of gravity, shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the
waveform has been calculated to higher post-Newtonian orders than leading. We
show that the inclusion of these higher order terms strengthens
single-parameter constraints, instead of weakening them, and that the
strengthening is very mild. This analysis therefore provides strong evidence
that single-parameter post-Einsteinian tests of general relativity are robust
to ignorance of high post-Newtonian order terms in the general relativistic
deformations.

Einstein-dilation Gauss-Bonnet gravity which is motivated by string theory. In
particular, we use two new neutron star black hole binaries (GW200105 and
GW200115). We also consider GW190814 which is consistent with both a binary
black hole and a neutron star black hole binary. Adopting the leading
post-Newtonian correction and carrying out a Bayesian Markov-chain Monte Carlo
analyses, we derive the 90\% credible upper bound on the coupling constant of
the theory as $\sqrt{\alpha_{GB}} \lesssim 1.33\,\rm km$, whose consistency is
checked with an independent Fisher analysis. This bound is stronger than the
bound obtained in previous literature by combining selected binary black hole
events in GWTC-1 and GWTC-2 catalogs. We also derive a combined bound of
$\sqrt{\alpha_{GB}} \lesssim 1.18\,\rm km$ by stacking GW200105, GW200115,
GW190814, and selected binary black hole events. In order to check the validity
of the effect of higher post-Newtonian terms, we derive corrections to the
waveform phase up to second post Newtonian order by mapping results in
scalar-tensor theories to Einstein-dilation Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We find that
such higher-order terms improve the bounds by $14.5\%$ for GW200105 and $6.9\%$
for GW200115 respectively.

spectroscopic observations of its red giant stars have shown a quite peculiar
behavior in the chemistry of its multiple populations. These results have
prompted UV and optical HST observations aimed at obtaining the cluster's
""Chromosome map"" (ChM), an efficient tool to classify GCs and characterize
their multiple populations. We find that the discontinuity in the abundance
distributions of O, Mg, Al and Na inferred from spectroscopy is more nuanced in
the ChM, which is mostly sensitive to nitrogen. Nevertheless, photometry in
optical bands reveals a double main sequence, indicating a discontinuity in the
helium content of the populations. The population with the largest chemical
anomalies (extreme) peaks at a helium mass fraction Y~0.31. This helium content
is consistent with results from the analysis of the distribution of
horizontal-branch stars and the spectrophotometry of the red giants. The ChM
and the color magnitude diagrams are compared with those in NGC 2808, a
prototype GC with helium abundances up to Y > 0.35, and both confirm that NGC
6402 does not host stellar populations with such extreme helium content.
Further, the ChM reveals the presence of a group of stars with larger
metallicity, thus indicating that NGC 6402 is a Type II cluster. The modalities
of formation of the multiple populations in NGC 6402 are briefly surveyed, with
main attention on the Asymptotic Giant Branch and Supermassive star models, and
on possible clusters' merging.

change have been controversial for over fifty years. This question is resolved
here using a combination of DFT phonon calculations with inelastic neutron
scattering under variable temperature and pressure, supported by complementary
total and quasielastic neutron scattering experiments. A simple model of the
entropy in which each molecular ion is disordered across the mirror plane in
the high symmetry phase, although widely used in the literature, proves to be
untenable. Instead, the entropy arises from low-frequency librations of
ammonium ions in this phase, with harmonic terms that are very small or even
negative. These results suggest that, in the search for molecular materials
with functionality derived from large entropy changes, vibrational entropy
arising from broad energy minima is likely to be just as important as
configurational entropy arising from crystallographic disorder.

evaluated resorting to a mathematical model joining a classical compartmental

exchanges and the progress of the infectious disease is realized by assuming on

approach for the development of statistical classifiers that takes into account
the decision-support context in which they are applied. Decision-making is
considered by preferentially querying data labels according to expected value
of perfect information (EVPI). Although several benefits are gained by adopting
a risk-based active learning approach, including improved decision-making
performance, the algorithms suffer from issues relating to sampling bias as a
result of the guided querying process. This sampling bias ultimately manifests
as a decline in decision-making performance during the later stages of active
learning, which in turn corresponds to lost resource/utility.
  The current paper proposes two novel approaches to counteract the effects of
sampling bias: semi-supervised learning, and discriminative classification
models. These approaches are first visualised using a synthetic dataset, then
subsequently applied to an experimental case study, specifically, the Z24
Bridge dataset. The semi-supervised learning approach is shown to have variable
performance; with robustness to sampling bias dependent on the suitability of
the generative distributions selected for the model with respect to each
dataset. In contrast, the discriminative classifiers are shown to have
excellent robustness to the effects of sampling bias. Moreover, it was found
that the number of inspections made during a monitoring campaign, and therefore
resource expenditure, could be reduced with the careful selection of the
statistical classifiers used within a decision-supporting monitoring system.

hydrodynamics is critical for optimizing reactor performance and stability. An
FBR allows experts to conduct different types of chemical reactions involving
multiphase materials, especially interaction between gas and solids. During
such complex chemical processes, formation of void regions in the reactor,
generally termed as bubbles, is an important phenomenon. Study of these bubbles
has a deep implication in predicting the reactor's overall efficiency. But
physical experiments needed to understand bubble dynamics are costly and
non-trivial. Therefore, to study such chemical processes and bubble dynamics, a
state-of-the-art massively parallel computational fluid dynamics discrete

the pure mapping class group for some graphs and allow us to compute the
asymptotic dimension of all locally coarsely bounded pure mapping class groups
of infinite rank graphs. This dimension is always either zero or infinite.

a cumbersome task even for the expert security staff. This paper presents a
novel strategy that extends a conventional encoder-decoder architecture to
perform instance-aware segmentation and extract merged instances of contraband
items without using any additional sub-network or an object detector. The
encoder-decoder network first performs conventional semantic segmentation and
retrieves cluttered baggage items. The model then incrementally evolves during
training to recognize individual instances using significantly reduced training
batches. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, a novel objective function minimizes
the network loss in each iteration by retaining the previously acquired
knowledge while learning new class representations and resolving their complex
structural inter-dependencies through Bayesian inference. A thorough evaluation
of our framework on two publicly available X-ray datasets shows that it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially within the challenging
cluttered scenarios, while achieving an optimal trade-off between detection
accuracy and efficiency.

we show analytically that the ill-posedness of the inversion is fundamental and
it exists even for continuous correlation functions. We discussed how to

such systems require exhaustive training efforts on large-scale data to
effectively diagnose chest abnormalities. Furthermore, procuring such

periodically tuned deep neural networks to learn different classification tasks

our knowledge, there is no incremental learning-driven image diagnostic
framework that is specifically designed to screen pulmonary disorders from the
CXRs. To address this, we present a novel framework that can learn to screen
different chest abnormalities incrementally. In addition to this, the proposed

on the values of the outcomes. Therefore, the approach in the above-said paper
is consistent with the above-mentioned fact and is able to measure the
intrinsic unsharpness of the observables. In this work, we also quantify the
unsharpness of observables in an outcome-independent way. But our approach is
different than the approach of the above-said paper. In this work, at first, we
construct two Luder's instrument-based unsharpness measures and provide the
tight upper bounds of those measures. Then we prove the monotonicity of the

the observables more fuzzy). This is consistent with the resource-theoretic
framework. Then we relate our approach to the approach of the above-said paper.
Next, we try to construct two instrument-independent unsharpness measures. In
particular, we define two instrument-independent unsharpness measures and
provide the tight upper bounds of those measures and then we derive the
condition for the monotonicity of those measures under a class of fuzzifying
processes and prove the monotonicity for dichotomic qubit observables. Then we
show that for an unknown measurement, the values of all of these measures can
be determined experimentally. Finally, we present the idea of the resource

geometry. Our findings re-create the three classes of impact behavior
previously noted from experiments: full-stop, rollout, and ricochet
\citep*{Wright2020}. An application of Set Voronoi tessellation assesses
packing fraction at a high resolution, revealing how grains shift relative to
each other during an impact event. Calculation of Von Mises strain
distributions then reveal how grains shift relative to the overall system,
leading to the notion of the 'skin zone'. Intuition would suggest that the
region of perturbed grains would grow deeper with higher velocity impacts,
results instead show that increasing velocity may actually evoke a change in
the grains' dissipative response that boosts lateral perturbation. Finally, we
consider as a whole how sub-surface response could link with impactor dynamics
to deepen our understanding of oblique, low-velocity impact events and help to
improve mission outcomes.

semantic segmentation for dense foggy scenes. Although significant research has
been directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation
to scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large
variations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as
fog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised
adaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and
multi-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method
(FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported
by the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high
self-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based
loss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained
at different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to
generate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These
scale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We
evaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes
adaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation
scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms
the current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images.
Specifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy
Driving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes

  Conference (CVPR) 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the recent success of long-tailed object detection, almost all
long-tailed object detectors are developed based on the two-stage paradigm. In
practice, one-stage detectors are more prevalent in the industry because they
have a simple and fast pipeline that is easy to deploy. However, in the
long-tailed scenario, this line of work has not been explored so far. In this
paper, we investigate whether one-stage detectors can perform well in this
case. We discover the primary obstacle that prevents one-stage detectors from
achieving excellent performance is: categories suffer from different degrees of
positive-negative imbalance problems under the long-tailed data distribution.
The conventional focal loss balances the training process with the same
modulating factor for all categories, thus failing to handle the long-tailed
problem. To address this issue, we propose the Equalized Focal Loss (EFL) that
rebalances the loss contribution of positive and negative samples of different
categories independently according to their imbalance degrees. Specifically,
EFL adopts a category-relevant modulating factor which can be adjusted
dynamically by the training status of different categories. Extensive
experiments conducted on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. With an end-to-end training pipeline, EFL
achieves 29.2% in terms of overall AP and obtains significant performance
improvements on rare categories, surpassing all existing state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/ModelTC/EOD.

independent pairs of observers, with both observers of each pair acting
independently on their part of the shared state from spatially separated
laboratories, and subsequently passing their qubits to the next pair in the
sequence. It has previously been conjectured that not more than one pair of
observers can detect Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt ""Bell-nonlocal"" correlations in
a similar set-up. This is intriguing since it is possible to have an
arbitrarily long sequence of Bell-nonlocal correlations when only a single
observer is allowed to share a bipartite state with multiple observers at the
other end. It is therefore interesting to ask whether such restrictions are
also present when entangled correlations are considered in the scenario of
multiple pairs of observers. We find that a two-qubit entangled state can be
used to witness entanglement arbitrarily many times, by pairs of observers,
acting sequentially and independently. We prove the statement to be true when
the initial pair of observers in the sequence share any pure entangled state or
when they share a state from a class of mixed entangled states. We demonstrate
that the phenomenon can also be observed for a certain class of entangled
states in which an arbitrarily long sequence of observer pairs witnessing
entanglement is reached in the limit of the initial entanglement content
tending to a vanishing amount.

Noise Ratio (SNR) in the RF data with depth, effectively rendering deep regions

mitigate this problem. First, increasing the power of transmitted beam which is
limited by safety threshold. Averaging consecutive frames is the second option
which not only reduces the framerate but also is not applicable for moving
targets. And third, reducing the transmission frequency, which deteriorates
spatial resolution. Many deep denoising techniques have been developed, but
they often require clean data for training the model, which is usually only
available in simulated images. Herein, a deep noise reduction approach is
proposed which does not need clean training target. The model is constructed

converges to the clean image that is the average of noisy pairs. Experimental

using LyMAS, and reconstruct the 3D density field between sightlines through
Wiener filtering in a configuration compatible with the future WEAVE-QSO
observations. The fidelity of the reconstruction is assessed by measuring one-
and two-point statistics from the distribution of critical points in the cosmic
web. In addition, initial Lagrangian statistics are predicted from first
principles, and measurements of the connectivity of the cosmic web are
performed. The reconstruction captures well the expected features in the auto-
and cross-correlations of the critical points. This remains true after a
realistic noise is added to the synthetic spectra, even though sparsity of
sightlines introduces systematics, especially in the cross-correlations of
points with mixed signature. Specifically, for walls and filaments, the most
striking clustering features could be measured with up to 4 sigma of
significance with a WEAVE-QSO-like survey. Moreover, the connectivity of each
peak identified in the reconstructed field is globally consistent with its
counterpart in the original field, indicating that the reconstruction preserves
the geometry of the density field not only statistically, but also locally.
Hence the critical points relative positions within the tomographic
reconstruction could be used as standard rulers for dark energy by WEAVE-QSO

wherein, given a labelled and unlabelled set of images, the task is to
categorize all images in the unlabelled set. Here, the unlabelled images may
come from labelled classes or from novel ones. Existing recognition methods are
not able to deal with this setting, because they make several restrictive
assumptions, such as the unlabelled instances only coming from known - or
unknown - classes, and the number of unknown classes being known a-priori. We
address the more unconstrained setting, naming it 'Generalized Category
Discovery', and challenge all these assumptions. We first establish strong
baselines by taking state-of-the-art algorithms from novel category discovery
and adapting them for this task. Next, we propose the use of vision
transformers with contrastive representation learning for this open-world
setting. We then introduce a simple yet effective semi-supervised $k$-means
method to cluster the unlabelled data into seen and unseen classes
automatically, substantially outperforming the baselines. Finally, we also

Capturing and replicating such coordinated activity is critical for virtual
characters that behave realistically. Surprisingly, most methods treat the 3D
modeling and tracking of bodies and hands separately. Here we formulate a model
of hands and bodies interacting together and fit it to full-body 4D sequences.
When scanning or capturing the full body in 3D, hands are small and often
partially occluded, making their shape and pose hard to recover. To cope with
low-resolution, occlusion, and noise, we develop a new model called MANO (hand
Model with Articulated and Non-rigid defOrmations). MANO is learned from around
1000 high-resolution 3D scans of hands of 31 subjects in a wide variety of hand
poses. The model is realistic, low-dimensional, captures non-rigid shape
changes with pose, is compatible with standard graphics packages, and can fit
any human hand. MANO provides a compact mapping from hand poses to pose blend
shape corrections and a linear manifold of pose synergies. We attach MANO to a
standard parameterized 3D body shape model (SMPL), resulting in a fully
articulated body and hand model (SMPL+H). We illustrate SMPL+H by fitting
complex, natural, activities of subjects captured with a 4D scanner. The
fitting is fully automatic and results in full body models that move naturally
with detailed hand motions and a realism not seen before in full body
performance capture. The models and data are freely available for research

hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) by using multi-modality non-contrast magnetic
resonance imaging (NCMRI) are crucial for the clinical diagnosis. However, it
is still a challenging task due to: (1) the HCC information on NCMRI is
invisible or insufficient makes extraction of liver tumors feature difficult;
(2) diverse imaging characteristics in multi-modality NCMRI causes feature
fusion and selection difficult; (3) no specific information between hemangioma
and HCC on NCMRI cause liver tumors detection difficult. In this study, we
propose a united adversarial learning framework (UAL) for simultaneous liver
tumors segmentation and detection using multi-modality NCMRI. The UAL first
utilizes a multi-view aware encoder to extract multi-modality NCMRI information
for liver tumor segmentation and detection. In this encoder, a novel edge
dissimilarity feature pyramid module is designed to facilitate the
complementary multi-modality feature extraction. Second, the newly designed
fusion and selection channel is used to fuse the multi-modality feature and
make the decision of the feature selection. Then, the proposed mechanism of
coordinate sharing with padding integrates the multi-task of segmentation and
detection so that it enables multi-task to perform united adversarial learning
in one discriminator. Lastly, an innovative multi-phase radiomics guided
discriminator exploits the clear and specific tumor information to improve the
multi-task performance via the adversarial learning strategy. The UAL is
validated in corresponding multi-modality NCMRI (i.e. T1FS pre-contrast MRI,
T2FS MRI, and DWI) and three phases contrast-enhanced MRI of 255 clinical
subjects. The experiments show that UAL has great potential in the clinical

we investigate the early evolution of the first SMBHs by constraining their
distribution in mass and luminosity at $z > 4$. In particular, we focus on the
poorly explored low-mass end of the nuclear black hole (BH) distribution down
to $z \simeq 4$, and explore its connection with the nature of the first BH
seeds and the processes governing their mass growth. To this aim, we have
developed CAT (Cosmic Archaeology Tool), a new semi-analytic model that
describes the formation of the first stars and black holes in a self-consistent
way and follows the co-evolution of nuclear BHs and their host galaxies for a
representative population at $z > 4$. We find that current observational
constraints favour models where the growth of BH seeds is Eddington limited and
occurs at the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate or where super-Eddington accretion
occurs via a slim disk during gas rich galaxy mergers. The main difference
between these two model variants lies at the low-end of the predicted mass and
luminosity functions at $4 \le z \le 6$, where a clear gap appears in the first
model, reflecting the stunted growth of light BH seeds formed as remnants of
the first stars. Detecting this signature will be extremely challenging even
for the future generation of space observatories, such as JWST, Athena and
Lynx.

Along three other sightlines, we find absorption likely to be associated with
individual galaxies, intragroup gas, and/or large-scale filamentary structure.
The absorption along these five sightlines is stronger in metal lines than
expected from individual galaxies, indicative of multiple contributions, and of
the complex kinematics of the region. We also identify three sightlines within
a 7-degree X 6-degree field around the Leo Ring, along which we do not find any
absorption. We find that the metallicities associated with the Leo Ring are
generally high, with values between solar and several times solar. The inferred
high metallicities are consistent with the origin of the ring as tidal debris

employ two different approaches: halo-based pasting (HP) and particle-based
pasting (PP). The former pastes gas density and pressure onto halos and
requires only a halo catalogue, and the latter considers the contribution from
field particles as well, i.e., particles that do not belong to any halos and
thus utilise the full particle information. Therefore, the PP algorithm
incorporates secondary effects beyond the HP algorithm: asphericity of halos
and contribution from diffuse gas. In particular, such a diffuse component is
the dominant source of the kinetic SZ effect. As validation of our methods, we
have produced 108 all-sky maps with HP and 108 flat-sky maps, which cover $5
\times 5 \, \mathrm{deg}^2$ with both HP and PP, and measured power spectra of
the maps. Our method can produce a mock map within a few hours, even for
all-sky coverage with a parallel computational environment. The power spectra
of HP maps are consistent with the halo model prediction of the thermal SZ
effect. On the other hand, the power spectra of PP maps are suppressed due to
the halo asphericity but can reproduce better the theoretical prediction for
the kinetic SZ effect. We discuss the utility of baryon-pasted mock SZ maps for
estimating the covariance matrix of SZ statistics and modelling the selection
and projection effects for cluster cosmology.

galaxies (SFGs). However, its role in the framework set by the scaling
relations in galaxy evolution remains to be understood. In this work we follow
up on the galaxy sample from the GOODS-ALMA 2.0 survey, an ALMA blind survey at
1.1mm covering a continuous area of 72.42arcmin$^2$ using two array
configurations. We derived physical properties, such as star formation rates,
gas fractions, depletion timescales, and dust temperatures for the galaxy
sample built from the survey. There exists a subset of galaxies that exhibit
starburst-like short depletion timescales, but they are located within the
scatter of the so-called main sequence of SFGs. These are dubbed starbursts in
the main sequence and display the most compact star formation and they are
characterized by the shortest depletion timescales, lowest gas fractions, and
highest dust temperatures of the galaxy sample, compared to typical SFGs at the
same stellar mass and redshift. They are also very massive, accounting for
$\sim 60\%$ of the most massive galaxies in the sample ($\log
(M_{\rm{*}}/M_{\odot}) > 11.0$). We find trends between the areas of the
ongoing star formation regions and the derived physical properties for the
sample, unveiling the role of compact star formation as a physical driver of
these properties. Starbursts in the main sequence appear to be the extreme
cases of these trends. We discuss possible scenarios of galaxy evolution to
explain the results drawn from our galaxy sample. Our findings suggest that the
star formation rate is sustained in SFGs by gas and star formation compression,
keeping them within the main sequence even when their gas fractions are low and
they are presumably on the way to quiescence.

place significant constraints upon high-redshift star formation, Reionization,
and dark matter (DM) using the global 21-cm signal of the intergalactic medium.
In the early universe, when the relative abundance of low-mass DM halos is
important, measuring the global signal would place constraints on the damping
of structure formation caused by DM having a higher relic velocity (warm dark
matter, or WDM) than in cold dark matter (CDM). Such damping, however, can be
mimicked by altering the star formation efficiency (SFE) and difficult to
detect because of the presence of Pop III stars with unknown properties. We
study these various cases and their degeneracies with the WDM mass parameter
$m_X$ using a Fisher matrix analysis. We study the $m_X = 7$ keV case and a
star-formation model that parametrizes the SFE as a strong function of halo
mass and include several variations of this model along with three different
input noise levels for the likelihood; we also use a minimum halo virial
temperature for collapse near the molecular cooling threshold. We find that
when the likelihood includes only Pop II stars, $m_X$ is constrained to an
uncertainty of $\sim 0.4$ keV for all models and noise levels at 68$\%$ CI.
When the likelihood includes weak Pop III stars, $m_X \sim 0.3$ keV, and if Pop
III star formation is relatively efficient, $m_X \sim 0.1$ keV uncertainty,
with tight Pop III star-formation parameter constraints. Our results show that
the global 21-cm signal is a promising test-bed for WDM models, even in the
presence of strong degeneracies with astrophysical parameters.

from all our senses. We introduce MERLOT Reserve, a model that represents
videos jointly over time -- through a new training objective that learns from
audio, subtitles, and video frames. Given a video, we replace snippets of text
and audio with a MASK token; the model learns by choosing the correct
masked-out snippet. Our objective learns faster than alternatives, and performs
well at scale: we pretrain on 20 million YouTube videos.
  Empirical results show that MERLOT Reserve learns strong multimodal
representations. When finetuned, it sets state-of-the-art on Visual Commonsense
Reasoning (VCR), TVQA, and Kinetics-600; outperforming prior work by 5%, 7%,
and 1.5% respectively. Ablations show that these tasks benefit from audio
pretraining -- even VCR, a QA task centered around images (without sound).
Moreover, our objective enables out-of-the-box prediction, revealing strong
multimodal commonsense understanding. In a fully zero-shot setting, our model
obtains competitive results on four video tasks, even outperforming supervised
approaches on the recently proposed Situated Reasoning (STAR) benchmark.
  We analyze why audio enables better vision-language representations,
suggesting significant opportunities for future research. We conclude by
discussing ethical and societal implications of multimodal pretraining.

between the X-ray corona and the accretion disc in variable active galactic
nuclei (AGN). Under certain conditions, photo-ionized outflows emerging from
central AGN regions also play a role in the observable spectral-timing
properties of the nuclear components. The variable ionizing flux causes the
intervening gas to ionize or recombine, resulting in a time-dependent
absorption spectrum. Understanding the spectral-timing properties of these
outflows is critical for the determination of their role in the AGN
environment, but also the correct interpretation of timing signatures of other
AGN components. In this paper, we test the capabilities of the Athena X-IFU
instrument in studying the spectral and spectral-timing properties of a black
hole system displaying a variable outflow. We take the narrow-line Seyfert 1
IRAS 13224-3809 as a test case. Our findings show that while the non-linear
response of the absorbing medium can result in complex behaviour of time lags,
the resulting decrease in the coherence can be used to constrain gas density
and distance to the central source. Ultimately, modelling the coherence spectra
of AGN outflows may constitute a valuable tool in studying the physical
properties of the outflowing gas.

challenges, swift progress in emerging quantum technologies is making this goal
realistically approachable. In this context, one of the essential resources is
quantum entanglement, which allows for quantum computations outperforming their
classical counterparts. However, the task of entanglement detection is not
always straightforward for several reasons. One of the main challenges is that
standardly-used methods rapidly become unfeasible when dealing with quantum
states containing more than a few qubits. Typically, this is due to the fact
that a vast amount of measurements is needed on many copies of the state.
Generally, it is not unusual to deal with a very limited number of state copies
in experimental settings - in fact, this may be the case for many large quantum
systems. In this article, an overview is provided of a probabilistic approach
that enables high-confidence genuine multipartite entanglement detection using
an exceptionally low number of state copies. Additionally, a study is presented
that shows that this protocol remains efficient also in the presence of noise,
thus confirming the practicality of the method for near-term quantum devices
and its suitability for complex experimental settings.

magnetic tunnel junction driven out of equilibrium by means of an applied
voltage and an applied temperature gradient, in the presence of an external
magnetic bias, which can be turn on/off. Here, we derive the spin excitation
spectrum for a two spin 1/2 system analytically and show that an external
magnetic field is required to lift the degeneracy in the triplet state, whether
both spin units experience the magnetic field in the same direction or in
opposite staggered directions. We show that an applied bias voltage in the
absence of a magnetic field, transfers the magnetization from the magnetic
leads into the spin units embedded in the molecule, hence breaking a symmetry
and lifting the triplet degeneracy in the absence of external magnetization.
From this theoretical demonstration, we then propose two schemes of magnetic
driving to lift spin degeneracy in the spin excitation spectrum, which we named
PMD (Parallel Magnetic Driving) and AMD (Anti-Parallel Magnetic Driving). We
argue that a symmetry breaking is then required to project the spin
configuration of a dimer into quantum transport measurements, and hence propose
different schemes to detect the spin triplet state and the spin singlet state
using differential conductivity measurements in the non-degenerate
non-symmetric configuration of the spin dimer, and compare our results with the
ones reported in the literature.

propose that a TvHS generates a novel time-reversal symmetry breaking excitonic
order -- arising due to bound pairs of electrons and holes located at opposite

investigate interaction induced many-body instabilities via the perturbative
renormalisation group technique and a free energy analysis. Specialising to
parameters appropriate for the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$, we construct a phase
diagram comprising chiral excitons, charge density wave and a region of
coexistence. We propose this as an explanation of a diverse range of
experimental observations in AV$_3$Sb$_5$. Notably, the chiral excitonic state
gives rise to a quantum anomalous Hall conductance, providing an appealing
interpretation of the observed anomalous Hall effect in kagome metals. Possible
alternative realisations of the TvHS mechanism in bilayer materials are also
discussed. We suggest that TvHS open up interesting possibilities for
correlated phases, enriching the set of competing ground states to include

the gas reservoir in cluster galaxies and in the last decades many studies have
characterized the properties of stripped galaxies. A definite census of the
importance of this process in local clusters is though still missing. Here we
characterize the fraction of galaxies showing signs of stripping at optical
wavelengths, using the data of 66 clusters from the WINGS and OMEGAWINGS
surveys. We focus on the infalling galaxy population and hence only consider
blue, bright (B<18.2) late-type spectroscopically confirmed cluster members
within 2 virial radii. In addition to ""traditional"" stripping candidates (SC)
-- i.e. galaxies showing unilateral debris and tails -- we also consider
unwinding galaxies (UG) as potentially stripped galaxies. Recent work has
indeed unveiled a connection between unwinding features and ram pressure
stripping and even though only integral field studies can inform on how often
these features are indeed due to ram pressure, it is important to include them
in the global census. We performed a visual inspection of B-band images and
here we release a catalog of 143 UG. SC and UG each represent ~15-20% of the
inspected sample. If we make the assumption that they both are undergoing ram
pressure stripping, we can conclude that at any given time in the low-z
universe about 35% of the infalling cluster population show signs of stripping
in their morphology at optical wavelengths. These fractions depend on color,
mass, morphology, and little on clustercentric distance. Making some rough
assumptions on the duration of the tail visibility and on the time cluster
galaxies can maintain blue colors, we infer that almost all bright blue
late-type cluster galaxies undergo a stripping phase during their life,
boosting the importance of ram pressure stripping in cluster galaxy evolution.

time-dependent correlated quantum transport in nano-systems: the
non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. Within this formalism, one
can treat, on the same footing, inter-particle interactions, external drives
and/or perturbations, and coupling to baths with a (piece-wise) continuum set
of degrees of freedom. After a historical overview on the theory of transport
in quantum systems, we present a modern introduction of the NEGF approach to
quantum transport. We discuss the inclusion of inter-particle interactions
using diagrammatic techniques, and the use of the so-called embedding and
inbedding techniques which take the bath couplings into account
non-perturbatively. In various limits, such as the non-interacting limit and
the steady-state limit, we then show how the NEGF formalism elegantly reduces
to well-known formulae in quantum transport as special cases. We then discuss
non-equilibrium transport in general, for both particle and energy currents.
Under the presence of a time-dependent drive - encompassing pump-probe
scenarios as well as driven quantum systems - we discuss the transient as well
as asymptotic behavior, and also how to use NEGF to infer information on the
out-of-equilibrium system. As illustrative examples, we consider model systems
general enough to pave the way to realistic systems. These examples encompass
one- and two-dimensional electronic systems, systems with electron-phonon
couplings, topological superconductors, and optically responsive molecular
junctions where electron-photon couplings are relevant.

pressing need due to its potential impact on automating business workflows
across many industries like financial services, insurance, and healthcare. The
key challenge is that form-like documents in these business workflows can be
laid out in virtually infinitely many ways; hence, a good solution to this
problem should generalize to documents with unseen layouts and languages. A
solution to this problem requires a holistic understanding of both the textual
segments and the visual cues within a document, which is non-trivial. While the
natural language processing and computer vision communities are starting to
tackle this problem, there has not been much focus on (1) data-efficiency, and
(2) ability to generalize across different document types and languages.
  In this paper, we show that when we have only a small number of labeled
documents for training (~50), a straightforward transfer learning approach from
a considerably structurally-different larger labeled corpus yields up to a 27
F1 point improvement over simply training on the small corpus in the target
domain. We improve on this with a simple multi-domain transfer learning
approach, that is currently in production use, and show that this yields up to
a further 8 F1 point improvement. We make the case that data efficiency is
critical to enable information extraction systems to scale to handle hundreds
of different document-types, and learning good representations is critical to
accomplishing this.

32 optically-bright TDEs using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients

differences between the spectroscopic classes. For all types, we find a shallow
distribution of star masses, compared to a typical initial mass function,
between $\sim 0.1-1$ M$_\odot$, and no TDEs with very deep ($\beta \gg 1$)

complete disruptions (and possibly lower SMBH masses) than TDE-H+He, with
TDE-He events fully disrupted. We also find that TDE-H events have more
extended photospheres, in agreement with recent literature, and argue that this
could be a consequence of differences in the self-intersection radii of the
debris streams. Finally, we identify an approximately linear correlation
between black hole mass and radiative efficiency. We suggest that TDE-H may be
powered by collision-induced outflows at relatively large radii, while TDE-H+He
could result from prompt accretion disks, formed more efficiently in closer
encounters around more massive SMBHs.

galaxy masses using Prospector fits to the UV-MIR spectral energy distributions
for the hosts of 29 well-observed TDEs with BH mass estimates from MOSFiT. We
then conduct detailed bulge/disk decomposition using SDSS and PanSTARRS
imaging, and provide a catalog of bulge masses. We measure a positive
correlation between SMBH and bulge mass for the TDE sample, with a power-law
slope of 0.28 and significance $p=0.06$ (Spearmans) and $p=0.05$ (Pearsons),
and an intrinsic scatter of 0.2 dex. Applying MC resampling and bootstrapping,
we find a more conservative estimate of the slope is $0.18\pm0.11$, dominated
by the systematic errors from Prospector and MOSFiT. This is shallower than the
slope at high SMBH mass, which may be due to a bias in the TDE sample towards
lower mass BHs that can more easily disrupt low-mass stars outside of the event
horizon. When combining the TDE sample with that of the high mass regime, we
find that TDEs are successful in extending the SMBH - stellar mass relationship
further down the mass spectrum and provide a relationship across the full range

starlight that is probably an outer spiral arm or tidal tail of the interacting
galaxy pair NGC2207/IC2163. There is one bright HII region projected within 1
kpc, and there is faint extended Halpha emission immediately surrounding the
continuum source at the position of SN2010jp, which has $M_{F555W} = -7.7 (\pm
0.2)$ mag. In principle, the lingering light could arise from late-time
circumstellar material (CSM) interaction, an evolved supergiant, a host star
cluster, or some combination of these. Steady flux over 3 yr and a lack of
strong, spatially unresolved Halpha emission make ongoing CSM interaction
unlikely. If an evolved supergiant dominates, its observed luminosity implies
an initial mass of roughly 22 $M_{\odot}$ and an age older than roughly 8 Myr.
If the source is a star cluster, then its colour and absolute magnitude imply
an age of 8-13 Myr and a modest cluster initial mass of log($M/M_{\odot}$) =
3.6-3.8. Extended Halpha emission out to a radius of 30 pc reveals a faint
evolved HII region, pointing to recent star formation with at least one late
O-type star. Based on these various clues, we conclude that the progenitor of
SN2010jp had a likely initial mass of 18-22 $M_{\odot}$.

models on distributed data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated
learning or feature-based federated learning applies to the cases that
different data sources share the same sample ID space but differ in feature
space. To ensure the data owners' long-term engagement, it is critical to
objectively assess the contribution from each data source and recompense them
accordingly. The Shapley value (SV) is a provably fair contribution valuation
metric originated from cooperative game theory. However, computing the SV
requires extensively retraining the model on each subset of data sources, which
causes prohibitively high communication costs in federated learning. We propose
a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value
(VerFedSV) based on SV. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable
properties for fairness but is also efficient to compute, and can be adapted to
both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both

sequentiality, a measure of narrative flow of events, drawing probabilistic
inferences from a cutting-edge large language model (GPT-3). Sequentiality
captures the flow of a narrative by comparing the probability of a sentence

results show that imagined stories have higher sequentiality than
autobiographical stories and that the sequentiality of autobiographical stories
increases when the memories are retold several months later. In pursuit of
deeper understandings of how sequentiality measures the flow of narratives, we
explore proportions of major and minor events in story sentences, as annotated

different levels of sophistication. Fabrication attacks are the easiest to
administer -- an adversary simply sends (extra) frames on a CAN -- but also the
easiest to detect because they disrupt frame frequency. To overcome time-based
detection methods, adversaries must administer masquerade attacks by sending
frames in lieu of (and therefore at the expected time of) benign frames but
with malicious payloads. Research efforts have proven that CAN attacks, and
masquerade attacks in particular, can affect vehicle functionality. Examples
include causing unintended acceleration, deactivation of vehicle's brakes, as
well as steering the vehicle. We hypothesize that masquerade attacks modify the
nuanced correlations of CAN signal time series and how they cluster together.
Therefore, changes in cluster assignments should indicate anomalous behavior.
We confirm this hypothesis by leveraging our previously developed capability
for reverse engineering CAN signals (i.e., CAN-D [Controller Area Network
Decoder]) and focus on advancing the state of the art for detecting masquerade
attacks by analyzing time series extracted from raw CAN frames. Specifically,
we demonstrate that masquerade attacks can be detected by computing time series
clustering similarity using hierarchical clustering on the vehicle's CAN
signals (time series) and comparing the clustering similarity across CAN
captures with and without attacks. We test our approach in a previously
collected CAN dataset with masquerade attacks (i.e., the ROAD dataset) and
develop a forensic tool as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential of
the proposed approach for detecting CAN masquerade attacks.

be orders of magnitude different, which poses a challenge to instrument and
mission design. A single exposure can saturate the bright emission and/or have
a low signal to noise ratio (SNR) for faint emission. Traditional high dynamic
range (HDR) techniques solve this problem by either combining multiple
sequential exposures of varied duration or splitting the light to different
sensors. These methods, however, can result in the loss of science capability,
reduced observational efficiency, or increased complexity and cost. The
simultaneous HDR method described in this paper avoids these issues by
utilizing a special type of detector whose rows can be read independently to
define zones that are then composited, resulting in areas with short or long
exposure measured simultaneously. We demonstrate this technique for the sun,
which is bright on disk and faint off disk. We emulated these conditions in the

method for a realistic solar imager and input. We then calculated SNRs, finding
a value of 45 for a faint coronal mass ejection (CME) and 200 for a bright CME,

with 2D group-III phosphides: AlP and GaP. The planar structure of AlP and
low-buckled GaP have been taken to form the bilayer patterns. In each case,
three stacking patterns are considered, and their relaxed interlayer distance
and binding energy have been reported. The binding energy being around in the
range between ~150 to 210 meV shows the existence of weak van der Waals
interactions between the layers. The heterostructures containing germanene and
these two phosphides show an opening of a large indirect bandgap of magnitude
range of ~200 meV to 600 meV, which can be tuned by changing interlayer
distance and by incorporating bi-axial compressive and tensile strain. Although
their normal bandgap, which significantly changes with SOC, is an indirect one,
whilst tunning the interlayer distance band gap jumps from unsymmetrical point
to symmetrical Dirac cones and becomes direct on K points. The charge carrier
mostly concentrates on the p-orbitals of the germanene in the conduction
regions; thus, the electrical properties of germanene will be retained, and the

  flows-aware machine learning approach",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper presents an approach for identification of vulnerable IoT
applications. The approach focuses on a category of vulnerabilities that leads
to sensitive information leakage which can be identified by using taint flow
analysis. Tainted flows vulnerability is very much impacted by the structure of
the program and the order of the statements in the code, designing an approach
to detect such vulnerability needs to take into consideration such information
in order to provide precise results. In this paper, we propose and develop an
approach, FlowsMiner, that mines features from the code related to program
structure such as control statements and methods, in addition to program's
statement order. FlowsMiner, generates features in the form of tainted flows.
We developed, Flows2Vec, a tool that transform the features recovered by
FlowsMiner into vectors, which are then used to aid the process of machine
learning by providing a flow's aware model building process. The resulting
model is capable of accurately classify applications as vulnerable if the
vulnerability is exhibited by changes in the order of statements in source
code. When compared to a base Bag of Words (BoW) approach, the experiments show
that the proposed approach has improved the AUC of the prediction models for
all algorithms and the best case for Corpus1 dataset is improved from 0.91 to
0.94 and for Corpus2 from 0.56 to 0.96

With a measured mass of 12 $\pm$ 3 $M_{\oplus}$ and a radius of 9.2 $\pm$ 0.1

transmission spectrum to a suite of 1D

Tikhonov regularization, the quasi-boundary value method has been proposed and
analyzed as an effective way for regularizing such inverse source problems,
which was shown to achieve an optimal order convergence rate under suitable
assumptions. However, fast direct or iterative solvers for the resulting
all-at-once large-scale linear systems have been rarely studied in the
literature. In this work, we first proposed and analyzed a modified
quasi-boundary value method, and then developed a diagonalization-based
parallel-in-time (PinT) direct solver, which can achieve a dramatic speedup in
CPU times when compared with MATLAB's sparse direct solver. In particular, the
time-discretization matrix $B$ is shown to be diagonalizable, and the condition
number of its eigenvector matrix $V$ is proven to exhibit quadratic growth,
which guarantees the roundoff errors due to diagonalization is well controlled.
Several 1D and 2D examples are presented to demonstrate the very promising
computational efficiency of our proposed method, where the CPU times in 2D
cases can be speedup by three orders of magnitude.

is reduced, the divergence angle of the output beam remains relatively narrow.
Moreover, the spatio-temporal lasing dynamics becomes significantly more stable
compared to that in a Fabry-Perot cavity. Our near-planar broad-area
semiconductor laser has higher brightness, better directionality and hence
allows shorter integration times than an incandescent lamp while featuring
sufficiently low speckle contrast at the same time, making it a vastly superior
light source for speckle-free imaging. Furthermore, our method of controlling
spatio-temporal dynamics with extreme sensitivity near a bifurcation point may
be applied to other types of high-power lasers and nonlinear dynamic systems.

public benchmark data set of synthetic transit spectra. We show that there is a
high degree of correlation in the spectral data, which calls for appropriate
low-dimensional representations. We explore a number of different techniques
for such dimensionality reduction and identify several suitable options in
terms of summary statistics, principal components, etc. We uncover interesting
structures in the principal component basis, namely, well-defined branches
corresponding to different chemical regimes of the underlying atmospheres. We
demonstrate that those branches can be successfully recovered with a K-means
clustering algorithm in fully unsupervised fashion. We advocate for a
three-dimensional representation of the spectroscopic data in terms of the
first three principal components, in order to reveal the existing structure in
the data and quickly characterize the chemical class of a planet.

applications due to its ability to handle multi-input multi-output systems with

limiting their embedded implementation for real-time control. To overcome the
bottleneck of traditional quadratic programming (QP) solvers, this paper
proposes a robust penalty method (RPM) to solve an optimization problem in a
linear MPC. The main idea of RPM is to solve an unconstrained QP problem using
Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shannon (BFGS) algorithm. The beauty of this method
is that it can find optimal solutions even if initial conditions are in an
infeasible region, which makes it robust. Moreover, the RPM is computationally
inexpensive as compared to the traditional QP solvers. The proposed RPM is
implemented on resource-limited embedded hardware (STM32 microcontroller), and
its performance is validated with a case study of a citation aircraft control
problem. We show the hardware-in-the-loop co-simulation results of the proposed
RPM and compared them with the active set method (ASM) and interior point
method (IPM) QP solvers. The performance of MPC with the aforementioned solvers
is compared by considering the optimality, time complexity, and ease of
hardware implementation. Presented results show that the proposed RPM gives the
same optimality as ASM and IPM, and outperforms them in terms of speed.

death worldwide and the second highest cause of mortality in the United States.
Researching the optimal control treatment or intervention strategy on the
comprehensive sepsis system is key in reducing mortality. For this purpose,
first, this paper improves a complex nonlinear sepsis model proposed in our
previous work. Then, bifurcation analyses are conducted for each sepsis
subsystem to study the model behaviors under some system parameters. The
bifurcation analysis results also further indicate the necessity of control
treatment and intervention therapy. If the sepsis system is without adding any
control under some parameter and initial system value settings, the system will
perform persistent inflammation outcomes as time goes by. Therefore, we develop
our complex improved nonlinear sepsis model into a sepsis optimal control
model, and then use some effective biomarkers recommended in existing clinic
practices as optimization objective function to measure the development of
sepsis. Besides that, a Bayesian optimization algorithm by combining Recurrent
neural network (RNN-BO algorithm) is introduced to predict the optimal control
strategy for the studied sepsis optimal control system. The difference between
the RNN-BO algorithm from other optimization algorithms is that once given any
new initial system value setting (initial value is associated with the initial
conditions of patients), the RNN-BO algorithm is capable of quickly predicting
a corresponding time-series optimal control based on the historical optimal
control data for any new sepsis patient. To demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the RNN-BO algorithm on solving the optimal control solution on
the complex nonlinear sepsis system, some numerical simulations are implemented

forecast constraints on the feedback processes heating the CGM with current and
future Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations. To constrain these processes, we
use a suite of cosmological simulations, the Cosmology and Astrophysics with
MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS), that varies four different feedback
parameters of two previously existing hydrodynamical simulations, IllustrisTNG
and SIMBA. We capture the dependencies of SZ radial profiles on these feedback
parameters with an emulator, calculate their derivatives, and forecast future
constraints on these feedback parameters from upcoming experiments. We find
that for a DESI-like (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) galaxy sample
observed by the Simons Observatory all four feedback parameters are able to be
constrained (some within the $10\%$ level), indicating that future observations
will be able to further restrict the parameter space for these sub-grid models.
Given the modeled galaxy sample and forecasted errors in this work, we find
that the inner SZ profiles contribute more to the constraining power than the
outer profiles. Finally, we find that, despite the wide range of AGN feedback
parameter variation in the CAMELS simulation suite, we cannot reproduce the tSZ

model which we call VGGb. Three experiments were then carried out using VGGb
for SER, using ASED. First, we investigated whether Mel-spectrogram features or
Mel-frequency Cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features work best for Amharic. This
was done by training two VGGb SER models on ASED, one using Mel-spectrograms
and the other using MFCC. Four forms of training were tried, standard
cross-validation, and three variants based on sentences, dialects and speaker
groups. Thus, a sentence used for training would not be used for testing, and
the same for a dialect and speaker group. The conclusion was that MFCC features
are superior under all four training schemes. MFCC was therefore adopted for
Experiment 2, where VGGb and three other existing models were compared on ASED:
RESNet50, Alex-Net and LSTM. VGGb was found to have very good accuracy (90.73%)
as well as the fastest training time. In Experiment 3, the performance of VGGb
was compared when trained on two existing SER datasets, RAVDESS (English) and
EMO-DB (German) as well as on ASED (Amharic). Results are comparable across
these languages, with ASED being the highest. This suggests that VGGb can be
successfully applied to other languages. We hope that ASED will encourage
researchers to experiment with other models for Amharic SER.

feature map and denoise the WHT domain coefficients using a nonlinearity which
is obtained by combining soft-thresholding with the tanh function. After
denoising, we compute the inverse WHT. We use 1D-WHT to replace the $1\times 1$

be also inserted before the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers to assist the

significantly with a slight decrease in trainable parameters. In this paper, we
implement the WHT layers into MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3-Large, and ResNet to

crowdsourced user studies. The first study (n=174) focused on whether a variety
of human-human interaction scenarios were perceived as either private/sensitive

integration of privacy controllers in authentic human-robot conversations can
allow for more trustworthy robots. This initial privacy controller will serve

primarily consider two network topologies: an all-to-all connected network

are broken into clusters of equal size. Although in both cases the bifurcation
structure is determined by symmetries in the system, the behavior of the two
systems is qualitatively different. In the all-to-all connected network, the
system undergoes Hopf bifurcations leading to periodic orbit solutions;
notably, for large $g$, there is a single, stable periodic orbit solution and
no stable fixed points. By contrast, in the clustered network, there are no
Hopf bifurcations, and there is a family of stable fixed points for large $g$.

provide a training strategy acccording to different stages, based on pseudo

In the construction of the network structure, we construct an aesthetic
adaptive block (AAB) structure that can adapt to any size of the input images.
Besides, we also use the efficient channel attention (ECA) to strengthen the

together by strong nuclear forces. Under the proper conditions, nuclei can
break into two (sometimes three) fragments which will subsequently decay by
emitting particles. This phenomenon is called nuclear fission. Since different
fission events may produce different fragmentations, the end-products of all
fissions that occurred in a small chemical sample of matter comprise hundreds
of different isotopes, including $\alpha$ particles, together with a large
number of emitted neutrons, photons, electrons and antineutrinos. The
extraordinary complexity of this process, which happens at length scales of the
order of a femtometer, mostly takes less than a femtosecond but is not
completely over until all the lingering $\beta$ decays have completed - which
can take years - is a fascinating window into the physics of atomic nuclei.
While fission may be more naturally known in the context of its technological
applications, it also plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of heavy elements
in astrophysical environments. In both cases, experimental measurements are not
sufficient to provide complete data. Simulations are needed, yet at levels of
accuracy and precision that pose formidable challenges to nuclear theory. The
goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical

number (SSN) and space weather events during solar cycles (SCs) 21-24, we focus
on the weak solar activity in SC 24. The weak solar activity reduces the number
of energetic eruptions from the Sun and hence the number of space weather
events. The speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), interplanetary (IP)
shocks, and the background solar wind all declined in SC 24. One of the main
heliospheric consequences of weak solar activity is the reduced total (magnetic
+ gas) pressure, magnetic field strength, and Alfv\'en speed. There are three
groups of phenomena that decline to different degrees in SC 24 relative to the
corresponding ones in SC 23: (i) those that decline more than SSN does, (ii)
those that decline like SSN, and (iii) those that decline less than SSN does.
The decrease in the number of severe space weather events such as high-energy
solar energetic particle (SEP) events and intense geomagnetic storms is deeper
than the decline in SSN. CMEs expand anomalously and hence their magnetic
content is diluted resulting in weaker geomagnetic storms. The reduction in the
number of intense geomagnetic storms caused by corotating interaction regions
is also drastic. The diminished heliospheric magnetic field in SC 24 reduces
the efficiency of particle acceleration, resulting in fewer high-energy SEP
events. The numbers of IP type II radio bursts, IP socks, and high-intensity
energetic storm particle events closely follow the number of fast and wide CMEs
(and approximately SSN). The number of halo CMEs in SC 24 declines less than
SSN does, mainly due to the weak heliospheric state. Phenomena such as IP CMEs
and magnetic clouds related to frontside halos also do not decline
significantly. The mild space weather is likely to continue in SC 25, whose
strength has been predicted to be not too different from that of SC 24.

random fields, each corresponding to a sample acquired for a different study

""all random fields exceed a predetermined threshold?"", or ""Where does at least
one random field exceed a predetermined threshold?"". To assess the degree of
spatial variability present, we develop a method that provides, with a desired
confidence, subsets and supersets of spatial regions defined by logical
conjunctions (i.e. set intersections) or disjunctions (i.e. set unions),

the final prediction at the testing phase, which is very troublesome. In this
paper, we propose an expert knowledge-guided geometric representation learning

features are constructed to mine the implicit relationship between deep

representation for the glioma grades. With a specially designed manifold
discrepancy measurement, the grading model can exploit the input image data and
expert knowledge more effectively in the training phase and get rid of the

framework is flexible regarding deep learning architectures to be utilized.
Three different architectures have been evaluated and five models have been

formation. The cold classical objects at radial distance r=42-47 au from the
Sun are predominantly very red (spectral slope s>17%) and often exist as
equal-size binaries (~30% observed binary fraction). This has been taken as
evidence for the in-situ formation of cold classicals. Interestingly, a small
fraction (~10%) of cold classicals is less red with s<17%, and these ""blue""
bodies are often found in wide binaries. Here we study the dynamical
implantation of blue binaries from r<42 au. We find that they can be implanted
into the cold classical belt from a wide range of initial radial distances, but
the survival of the widest blue binaries -- 2001 QW322 and 2003 UN284 --
implies formation at r>30 au. This would be consistent with the hypothesized
less-red to very-red transition at 30<r<40 au. For any reasonable choice of
parameters (Neptune's migration history, initial disk profile, etc.), however,
our model predicts a predominance of blue singles, rather than blue binaries,
which contradicts existing observations. We suggest that wide blue binaries
formed in situ at r=42-47 au and their color reflects early formation in a
protoplanetary gas disk. The predominantly VR colors of cold classicals may be
related to the production of methanol and other hydrocarbons during the late
stages of the disk, when the temperature at 45 au dropped to 20 K and carbon
monoxide was hydrogenated.

nuanced touch. For example, we might gently hold another's arm to offer a sense
of calm, yet intensively hold another's arm to express excitement or anxiety.
As this example indicates, distinct sentiments may be shaped by the subtlety in
one's touch delivery. This work investigates how slight distinctions in
skin-to-skin contact influence both the recognition of cued emotional messages
(e.g., anger, sympathy) and the rating of emotional content (i.e., arousal,
valence). By self-selecting preferred gestures (e.g., holding, stroking),
touchers convey distinct messages by touching the receiver's forearm.
Skin-to-skin contact attributes (e.g., velocity, depth, area) are optically
tracked in high resolution. Contact is then examined within gesture, between
messages. The results indicate touchers subtly, but significantly, vary contact
attributes of a gesture to communicate distinct messages, which are
recognizable by receivers. This tuning also correlates with receivers' arousal
and valence. For instance, arousal increases with velocity for stroking, and
depth for holding. Moreover, as shown here with human-to-human touch, valence
is tied with velocity, which is the same trend as reported with brushes. The
findings indicate that subtle nuance in skin-to-skin contact is important in
conveying social messages and inducing emotions.

  Probabilistic Forecasting with Application to Electricity Demand",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Some real-world decision-making problems require making probabilistic
forecasts over multiple steps at once. However, methods for probabilistic
forecasting may fail to capture correlations in the underlying time-series that
exist over long time horizons as errors accumulate. One such application is
with resource scheduling under uncertainty in a grid environment, which
requires forecasting electricity demand that is inherently noisy, but often
cyclic. In this paper, we introduce the conditional approximate normalizing
flow (CANF) to make probabilistic multi-step time-series forecasts when
correlations are present over long time horizons. We first demonstrate our
method's efficacy on estimating the density of a toy distribution, finding that
CANF improves the KL divergence by one-third compared to that of a Gaussian
mixture model while still being amenable to explicit conditioning. We then use
a publicly available household electricity consumption dataset to showcase the
effectiveness of CANF on joint probabilistic multi-step forecasting. Empirical
results show that conditional approximate normalizing flows outperform other
methods in terms of multi-step forecast accuracy and lead to up to 10x better
scheduling decisions. Our implementation is available at

immense research attention in recent times. Such heterogeneous network
embedding (HNE) methods effectively harness the heterogeneity of small-scale
HINs. However, in the real world, the size of HINs grow exponentially with the
continuous introduction of new nodes and different types of links, making it a
billion-scale network. Learning node embeddings on such HINs creates a
performance bottleneck for existing HNE methods that are commonly centralized,
i.e., complete data and the model are both on a single machine. To address
large-scale HNE tasks with strong efficiency and effectiveness guarantee, we
present \textit{Decentralized Embedding Framework for Heterogeneous Information

pipeline that utilizes hypergraphs in order to infuse parallelization into the
HNE task. DeHIN presents a context preserving partition mechanism that
innovatively formulates a large HIN as a hypergraph, whose hyperedges connect
semantically similar nodes. Our framework then adopts a decentralized strategy
to efficiently partition HINs by adopting a tree-like pipeline. Then, each
resulting subnetwork is assigned to a distributed worker, which employs the
deep information maximization theorem to locally learn node embeddings from the
partition it receives. We further devise a novel embedding alignment scheme to
precisely project independently learned node embeddings from all subnetworks
onto a common vector space, thus allowing for downstream tasks like link
prediction and node classification.

within the SDSS Stripe 82 region that have long-term photometric coverage
during $\sim 1998-2020$ with SDSS, PanSTARRS-1, the Dark Energy Survey, and
dedicated follow-up monitoring with Blanco 4m/DECam. With on average $\sim 200$
nightly epochs per quasar per filter band, we improve the parameter constraints
from a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model fit to the light curves over previous
studies with 10-15 yr baselines and $\lesssim 100$ epochs. We find that the
average damping timescale $\tau_{\rm DRW}$ continues to rise with increased
baseline, reaching a median value of $\sim 750$ days ($g$ band) in the
rest-frame of these quasars using the 20-yr light curves. Some quasars may have
gradual, long-term trends in their light curves, suggesting that either the DRW
fit requires very long baselines to converge, or that the underlying
variability is more complex than a single DRW process for these quasars. Using
a subset of quasars with better-constrained $\tau_{\rm DRW}$ (less than 20\% of
the baseline), we confirm a weak wavelength dependence of $\tau_{\rm
DRW}\propto \lambda^{0.51\pm0.20}$. We further quantify optical variability of
these quasars over days to decades timescales using structure function (SF) and
power spectrum density (PSD) analyses. The SF and PSD measurements
qualitatively confirm the measured (hundreds of days) damping timescales from
the DRW fits. However, the ensemble PSD is steeper than that of a DRW on
timescales less than $\sim$ a month for these luminous quasars, and this second
break point correlates with the longer DRW damping timescale.

connection between the IUs and the BS as there is no direct path between the
former and the latter. The EUs are located nearby the BS in order to
effectively harvest energy from the high-power signal from the BS, while the
much weaker signal reflected from the RIS hardly contributes to the EUs'
harvested energy. To provide reliable links for all users over the same
time-slot, we adopt the transmit time-switching (transmit-TS) approach, under
which information and energy are delivered over different time-slot fractions.
This allows us to rely on conjugate beamforming for energy links and
zero-forcing/regularized zero-forcing beamforming (ZFB/RZFB) and on the
programmable reflecting coefficients (PRCs) of the RIS for information links.
We show that ZFB/RZFB and PRCs can be still separately optimized in their joint

We then develop a path-following algorithm for solving our max-min IU

astrophysics known as magnetic reconnection (MR), a new energy extraction
mechanism based on the fast reconnection of the magnetic field lines inside the
ergosphere has been proposed by Comisso and Asenjo. In this paper, we
investigate energy extraction caused by MR in the ergosphere of a rapidly
spinning BH with broken Lorentz symmetry by a background bumblebee vector
field. The desired rotating BH solution differentiates from the standard Kerr
BH via the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter $l$, which comes from
nonminimal coupling between the bumblebee field with nonzero vacuum expectation
value and gravity. We find that incorporating $l<0$ in the background is in the
interest of the energy extraction via MR for the fast-spinning BH surrounded by
the plasma with weak magnetization, below what is expected from the scenario by
Comisso and Asenjo. Our analysis robustly indicates that the power of energy
extraction and efficiency of the plasma energization process through fast MR is
more efficient than the Comisso-Asenjo solution, provided that the LSB
parameter is negative, $l<0$. Compared to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism
arising from the underlying background, we also show that MR is a more
efficient energy extraction mechanism if $l<0$.

merger rate and a weighted average of chirp masses, the expected detection
numbers are generally much smaller than the results obtained by the same
authors immediately after the report of GW150914. For LISA, the total BBH
detections are estimated to be $N_{\rm tot}\sim 2 (T/4{\rm yr})^{3/2}(\rho_{\rm

detection threshold, $T$: the observational period). TianQin will have a total

potential to find $N_{\rm mer}\sim0.6 (T/4{\rm yr})^{7/4}(\rho_{\rm

merging BBHs is 4-5 times larger than that of LISA, because of the difference

surface poses a fundamental challenge to realize QAHE or AI, which requires an
insulating gap in thin films with at least one Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface. In theory,
the insulating phase can still be realized in a film if both surfaces are
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ layers. Otherwise, it requires that the film thickness is less

two-way half-duplex (HD) or a two-way full-duplex (FD). Also, for more accurate
satisfaction and reduction of communication delays, sending and receiving with
short packets is considered. Effective capacity appropriately measures the
transmission rate under the delay constraint. Therefore, it is considered as a
performance evaluation criterion here. With a two-way relay, two nodes exchange
data with each other using a relay simultaneously. The priorities and
requirements of the two nodes are not necessarily the same. Therefore, to
increase performance, the system is modeled and solved as a multi-objective
problem. In this way, the available power in the network is divided between the
relay and two nodes, and the effective capacity of the two nodes is maximized.
Depending on the different conditions, the optimal amount of allocated power to
relay and nodes is calculated. However, due to the complexity and time
consuming calculations, an approximate method which speeds up the calculation
is presented. The approximated solution has a very close performance to the
optimal allocated power. Finally, various comparisons have been made in
different conditions between the performance of two-way HD and two-way FD
relays. The improvement of multi-objective power allocation has been shown,

the rotational rate $v_1\sin$$i=53\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$ for the more massive

0.002$ M$_\odot$, $R_1 = 1.626 \pm 0.008$ M$_\odot$, $R_2 = 0.290 \pm 0.003$
M$_\odot$, $L_1 = 15.5 \pm 1.4$ L$_\odot$, and $L_2 = 1.84 \pm 0.16$ L$_\odot$.
In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, WASP 1625-04 A lies on the zero-age main
sequence and its companion accords well with the helium-core white dwarf models
of 0.19 M$_\odot$ in the constant luminosity phase. Our improved results
demonstrate that WASP 1625-04 is a typical EL CVn-type binary with a low mass
ratio and $M_2$ combination in the thin-disk population and is the product of
the stable, non-conservative mass transfer of the precursor binary.

exploit the underlying patterns of these distributed data for accurate power
prediction, federated learning is needed as a collaborative but
privacy-preserving training scheme. However, current federated learning
frameworks are polarized towards addressing either the horizontal or vertical
separation of data, and tend to overlook the case where both are present.
Furthermore, in mainstream horizontal federated learning frameworks, only
artificial neural networks are employed to learn the data patterns, which are
considered less accurate and interpretable compared to tree-based models on
tabular datasets. To this end, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework
based on XGBoost, for distributed power prediction from real-time external
features. In addition to introducing boosted trees to improve accuracy and
interpretability, we combine horizontal and vertical federated learning, to
address the scenario where features are scattered in local heterogeneous
parties and samples are scattered in various local districts. Moreover, we
design a dynamic task allocation scheme such that each party gets a fair share
of information, and the computing power of each party can be fully leveraged to
boost training efficiency. A follow-up case study is presented to justify the
necessity of adopting the proposed framework. The advantages of the proposed

harvesting (EH) source equipped remote sensing setting is considered. The EH
source opportunistically samples one or multiple processes over discrete time
instants, and sends the status updates to a sink node over a time-varying
wireless link. At any discrete time instant, the EH node decides whether to
ascertain the link quality using its stored energy (called probing) and then,
decides whether to sample a process and communicate the data based on the
channel probe outcome. The trade-off is between the freshness of information
available at the sink node and the available energy at the energy buffer of the
source node. To this end, infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) theory
is used to formulate the problem of minimization of time-averaged expected AoI
for a single energy harvesting source node. The following two scenarios are
considered: (i) energy arrival process and channel fading process are
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across time, (ii) energy
arrival process and channel fading process are Markovian. In the i.i.d.
setting, after probing a channel, the optimal source node sampling policy is
shown to be a threshold policy involving the instantaneous age of the process,
the available energy in the buffer and the instantaneous channel quality as the
decision variables. Also, for unknown channel state and energy harvesting
characteristics, a variant of the Q-learning algorithm is proposed for the
two-stage action taken by the source, that seeks to learn the optimal status
update policy over time. For Markovian channel and Markovian energy arrival
processes, the problem is again formulated as an MDP, and a learning algorithm
is provided to handle unknown dynamics. Finally, numerical results are provided

GPU threads. It is useful in applications with nested parallelism, particularly
where the amount of nested parallelism is irregular and cannot be predicted
beforehand. However, prior works have shown that dynamic parallelism may impose
a high performance penalty when a large number of small grids are launched. The
large number of launches results in high launch latency due to congestion, and
the small grid sizes result in hardware underutilization.
  To address this issue, we propose a compiler framework for optimizing the use
of dynamic parallelism in applications with nested parallelism. The framework
features three key optimizations: thresholding, coarsening, and aggregation.
Thresholding involves launching a grid dynamically only if the number of child
threads exceeds some threshold, and serializing the child threads in the parent
thread otherwise. Coarsening involves executing the work of multiple thread
blocks by a single coarsened block to amortize the common work across them.
Aggregation involves combining multiple child grids into a single aggregated
grid.
  Our evaluation shows that our compiler framework improves the performance of
applications with nested parallelism by a geometric mean of 43.0x over
applications that use dynamic parallelism, 8.7x over applications that do not
use dynamic parallelism, and 3.6x over applications that use dynamic
parallelism with aggregation alone as proposed in prior work.

show featureless transmission spectra. While atmospheric aerosols are a
promising explanation for both the low density and featureless spectra, there

Previous studies suggested that rings cause anomalously large transit radii.
However, it remains poorly understood how rings affect the transmission
spectrum. Here, we provide a framework to characterize the transmission spectra
of ringed exoplanets. We develop an analytical prescription to include rings in
the transmission spectra for arbitrarily viewing geometries. We also establish
a simple post-processing model that can include the ring's effects on
precomputed ring-free spectra. The ring flattens the transmission spectrum for
a wide range of viewing geometries, consistent with the featureless spectra of
extremely low-density exoplanets. Near-future observations by JWST at longer
wavelengths would be able to distinguish the aerosol and ring scenarios. We
also find that rocky rings might cause a silicate feature at $\sim$10 $\mu$m if
the ring's optical depth is around unity. Thus, the ring's spectral features,
if detected, would provide tight constrains on the physical properties of
exoplanetary rings. We also discuss the ring's stability and suggest that thick
rings are sustainable only at the equilibrium temperature of $\lesssim$300 K
for the ring's age comparable to Kepler planets. This might indicate the
intrinsic deficit of thick rings in the Kepler samples, unless rings are much
younger than the planets as suggested for Saturn.

By confronting 6 current sets of NLO parton FFs for large $p_{\rm T}$ hadron

  Learning for Proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence","Accepted by ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automated monitoring of dark web (DW) platforms on a large scale is the first
step toward developing proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). While there
are efficient methods for collecting data from the surface web, large-scale
dark web data collection is often hindered by anti-crawling measures. In
particular, text-based CAPTCHA serves as the most prevalent and prohibiting
type of these measures in the dark web. Text-based CAPTCHA identifies and
blocks automated crawlers by forcing the user to enter a combination of
hard-to-recognize alphanumeric characters. In the dark web, CAPTCHA images are
meticulously designed with additional background noise and variable character
length to prevent automated CAPTCHA breaking. Existing automated CAPTCHA
breaking methods have difficulties in overcoming these dark web challenges. As
such, solving dark web text-based CAPTCHA has been relying heavily on human
involvement, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we
propose a novel framework for automated breaking of dark web CAPTCHA to
facilitate dark web data collection. This framework encompasses a novel
generative method to recognize dark web text-based CAPTCHA with noisy
background and variable character length. To eliminate the need for human
involvement, the proposed framework utilizes Generative Adversarial Network
(GAN) to counteract dark web background noise and leverages an enhanced
character segmentation algorithm to handle CAPTCHA images with variable
character length. Our proposed framework, DW-GAN, was systematically evaluated
on multiple dark web CAPTCHA testbeds. DW-GAN significantly outperformed the
state-of-the-art benchmark methods on all datasets, achieving over 94.4%
success rate on a carefully collected real-world dark web dataset...

$W^{1, \mathcal{H}}(\Omega)$ is the associated Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev space.
First, an existence result is proved under some weak coercivity condition. Our
main focus aims at the treatment of the problem under consideration when
coercivity fails. To this end we establish the method of sub-supersolution for
the multi-valued variational inequality in the space $W^{1,
\mathcal{H}}(\Omega)$ based on appropriately defined sub- and supersolutions,
which yields the existence of solutions within an ordered interval of
sub-supersolution. Moreover, the existence of extremal solutions will be shown
provided the closed, convex subset $K$ of $W^{1, \mathcal{H}}(\Omega)$
satisfies a lattice condition. As an application of the sub-supersolution
method we are able to show that a class of generalized
variational-hemivariational inequalities with a leading double phase operator
are included as a special case of the multi-valued variational inequality
considered here. Based on a fixed point argument, we also study the case when
the corresponding Nemytskij operators $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{F}_\Gamma$ need
not be continuous. At the end, we give a nontrivial example of the construction
of sub- and supersolutions related to the problem above.

collect various activity data. We used that dataset to train 5 different
classification models. We selected the XGBoost classification model for
detecting a prior-fall activity and the chest location for use in fall
detection from a comparison of the detection accuracy. We then tested 3
existing fall detection threshold algorithms to detect fall and fall to their
knees first, and selected the 3-phase threshold algorithm of Chaitep and

conductivity with the above scattering rate, we find that for these strongly
renormalized quasiparticles, scattering is much weaker than Planckian, implying
that the linear temperature dependence should be due to other effects. We
discuss implications of this finding and point to directions for further work.

two-dimensional signals by using deep learning methods. In this context, most
researchers have tried to classify hyperspectral images by using deep learning
methods and classification success over 90% has been achieved for these images.
Deep neural networks (DNN) actually consist of two parts: i) Convolutional
neural network (CNN) and ii) fully connected neural network (FCNN). While CNN
determines the features, FCNN is used in classification. In classification of
the hyperspectral images, it is observed that almost all of the researchers
used 2D or 3D convolution filters on the spatial data beside spectral data
(features). It is convenient to use convolution filters on images or time
signals. In hyperspectral images, each pixel is represented by a signature
vector which consists of individual features that are independent of each
other. Since the order of the features in the vector can be changed, it doesn't
make sense to use convolution filters on these features as on time signals. At
the same time, since the hyperspectral images do not have a textural structure,
there is no need to use spatial data besides spectral data. In this study,
hyperspectral images of Indian pines, Salinas, Pavia centre, Pavia university
and Botswana are classified by using only fully connected neural network and
the spectral data with one dimensional. An average accuracy of 97.5% is
achieved for the test sets of all hyperspectral images.

financial transactions, communication networks, and so on. However, most
existing works trying to detect anomalies on attributed networks only consider
a single kind of interaction, so they cannot deal with various kinds of
interactions on multi-view attributed networks. It remains a challenging task
to jointly consider all different kinds of interactions and detect anomalous
instances on multi-view attributed networks. In this paper, we propose a graph
convolution-based framework, named AnomMAN, to detect Anomaly on Multi-view
Attributed Networks. To jointly consider attributes and all kinds of
interactions on multi-view attributed networks, we use the attention mechanism
to define the importance of all views in networks. Since the low-pass
characteristic of graph convolution operation filters out most high-frequency
signals (aonmaly signals), it cannot be directly applied to anomaly detection
tasks. AnomMAN introduces the graph auto-encoder module to turn the
disadvantage of low-pass features into an advantage. According to experiments
on real-world datasets, AnomMAN outperforms the state-of-the-art models and two
variants of our proposed model.

imaging community. While a large variety of DA techniques has been proposed for
image segmentation, most of these techniques have been validated either on
private datasets or on small publicly available datasets. Moreover, these
datasets mostly addressed single-class problems. To tackle these limitations,
the Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge was organised in
conjunction with the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing
and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2021). CrossMoDA is the first large
and multi-class benchmark for unsupervised cross-modality DA. The challenge's
goal is to segment two key brain structures involved in the follow-up and
treatment planning of vestibular schwannoma (VS): the VS and the cochleas.
Currently, the diagnosis and surveillance in patients with VS are performed
using contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) MRI. However, there is growing interest in
using non-contrast sequences such as high-resolution T2 (hrT2) MRI. Therefore,
we created an unsupervised cross-modality segmentation benchmark. The training
set provides annotated ceT1 (N=105) and unpaired non-annotated hrT2 (N=105).
The aim was to automatically perform unilateral VS and bilateral cochlea
segmentation on hrT2 as provided in the testing set (N=137). A total of 16
teams submitted their algorithm for the evaluation phase. The level of
performance reached by the top-performing teams is strikingly high (best median
Dice - VS:88.4%; Cochleas:85.7%) and close to full supervision (median Dice -
VS:92.5%; Cochleas:87.7%). All top-performing methods made use of an
image-to-image translation approach to transform the source-domain images into
pseudo-target-domain images. A segmentation network was then trained using
these generated images and the manual annotations provided for the source
image.

underwater images usually suffer from color distortion and blurred details.
However, due to the limited number of paired underwater images with undistorted
images as reference, training deep enhancement models for diverse degradation
types is quite difficult. To boost the performance of data-driven approaches,
it is essential to establish more effective learning mechanisms that mine
richer supervised information from limited training sample resources. In this
paper, we propose a novel underwater image enhancement network, called
SGUIE-Net, in which we introduce semantic information as high-level guidance
across different images that share common semantic regions. Accordingly, we
propose semantic region-wise enhancement module to perceive the degradation of
different semantic regions from multiple scales and feed it back to the global
attention features extracted from its original scale. This strategy helps to
achieve robust and visually pleasant enhancements to different semantic
objects, which should thanks to the guidance of semantic information for
differentiated enhancement. More importantly, for those degradation types that
are not common in the training sample distribution, the guidance connects them
with the already well-learned types according to their semantic relevance.
Extensive experiments on the publicly available datasets and our proposed
dataset demonstrated the impressive performance of SGUIE-Net. The code and

technique for dynamic rate-adaptive single-pixel imaging and sensing, which
only needs to train the network for one time that is available for any sampling
rates. Specifically, we introduce a novel weighting scheme in the encoding
process to characterize different patterns' modulation efficiency. While the
network is training at a high sampling rate, the modulation patterns and
corresponding weights are updated iteratively, which produces optimal ranked
encoding series when converged. In the experimental implementation, the optimal
pattern series with the highest weights are employed for light modulation, thus
achieving highly-efficient imaging and sensing. The reported strategy saves the
additional training of another low-rate network required by the existing
dynamic single-pixel networks, which further doubles training efficiency.
Experiments on the MNIST dataset validated that once the network is trained

real-world scenarios such as disaster rescue and package delivery. Many of
these working environments are unstructured with uncertain and dynamic
obstacles. UAV collision frequently happens. An UAV with high agility is highly
desired to adjust its motions to adapt to these environmental dynamics.
However, UAV agility is restricted by its battery power output; particularly,
an UAV's power system cannot be aware of its actual power need in motion
planning while the need is dynamically changing as the environment and UAV
condition vary. It is difficult to accurately and timely align the power supply
with power needs in motion plannings. This mismatching will lead to an
insufficient power supply to an UAV and cause delayed motion adjustments,
largely increasing the risk of collisions with obstacles and therefore
undermine UAV agility. To improve UAV agility, a novel intelligent power
solution, Agility-Enhanced Power Supply (AEPS), was developed to proactively
prepare appropriate amount powers at the right timing to support motion
planning with enhanced agility. This method builds a bridge between the
physical power system and UAV planning. With agility-enhanced motion planning,
the safety of UAV in complex working environment will be enhanced. To evaluate
AEPS effectiveness, missions of ""patrol missions for community security"" with
unexpected obstacles were adopted; the power supply is realized by hybrid
integration of fuel cell, battery, and capacitor. The effectiveness of AEPS in
improving UAV agility was validated by the successful and timely power supply,

significant performance improvement. We consider the practical scenario where
the offloading gain and resource costs are time-varying; and propose an online
optimization algorithm that maximizes the service performance without requiring

minimal assumptions about the system stochasticity. We fully implement the
proposed algorithm in a wireless testbed and evaluate its performance using a

The pivotal step depends only on the asymptotic behavior of the distribution

of $|\mathbf p|\to\pm\infty$ rather than the detailed functional form of the
dispersion. We address two subjects motivated by this observation. One concerns
reformulating (1+1) dimensional chiral anomaly using kinetic theory with the
current algebra approach and the gradient expansion of the Dirac Lagrangian,
adding a complementary perspective to the existing approaches. The other
demonstrates the universality of chiral anomaly across various quasiparticle

monotonic dispersion in order to exhibit chiral anomaly.

pairs formed by segmenting the document. First, we divide the document into two
parts (e.g., title and abstract, etc) which construct a coupled text pair.
Then, we adopt negative sampling to construct uncoupled text pairs whose two

the black box problem with machine learning models and provide answers to the
""how much"" question for each measured impact factor in every county. For most
counties, a higher percentage vote for Republicans, a greater African American
population share, and a higher poverty rate lower the vaccination rate. While a
higher Asian population share increases the predicted vaccination rate. The
impact on the vaccination rate from the Hispanic population proportion is
positive in the OLS model, but only positive for counties with a high Hispanic
population (>65%) in the Random Forest model. Both the proportion of seniors
and the one for young people in a county have a significant impact in the OLS
model - positive and negative, respectively. In contrast, the impacts are
ambiguous in the Random Forest model. Because results vary between geographies

controlled rectangular metric spaces, by changing the rectangular inequality as
follows: \begin{equation*}
  d(x, y)\leq\alpha(x, u)d(x, u)+\alpha(u, v)d(u, v)+\alpha(v, y)d(v, y),
\end{equation*} for all distinct $x, y, u, v\in X$ with the function $\alpha:

for self-mappings defined on such spaces. Our main results extends and improves
many results existing in the literature. Moreover, an illustrative example is
presented to support the obtained results.

or lateral jitter into an interferometric phase signal. It is an important
noise source in precision interferometers and originates either from changes in
the optical path lengths or from wavefront and clipping effects. Within this
paper, we focus on geometric TTL coupling and categorize it into a number of
different mechanisms for which we give analytic expressions. We then show that
this geometric description is not always sufficient to predict the TTL coupling
noise within an interferometer. We, therefore, discuss how understanding the
geometric effects allows TTL noise reduction already by smart design choices.
Additionally, they can be used to counteract the total measured TTL noise in a
system. The presented content applies to a large variety of precision
interferometers, including space gravitational wave detectors like LISA.

aspects for human intelligence. A human teacher can track the knowledge of
students to customize the teaching on students needs. With the rise of online
education platforms, there is a similar need for machines to track the
knowledge of students and tailor their learning experience. This is known as
the Knowledge Tracing (KT) problem in the literature. Effectively solving the
KT problem would unlock the potential of computer-aided education applications
such as intelligent tutoring systems, curriculum learning, and learning
materials' recommendation. Moreover, from a more general viewpoint, a student
may represent any kind of intelligent agents including both human and
artificial agents. Thus, the potential of KT can be extended to any machine
teaching application scenarios which seek for customizing the learning
experience for a student agent (i.e., a machine learning model). In this paper,
we provide a comprehensive and systematic review for the KT literature. We
cover a broad range of methods starting from the early attempts to the recent
state-of-the-art methods using deep learning, while highlighting the
theoretical aspects of models and the characteristics of benchmark datasets.
Besides these, we shed light on key modelling differences between closely
related methods and summarize them in an easy-to-understand format. Finally, we
discuss current research gaps in the KT literature and possible future research
and application directions.

networks. By studying large sets of real-world Performance Monitoring (PM) data
collected from six international optical networks, we find that it is possible
to forecast LOS events with good precision 1-7 days before they occur, albeit
at relatively low recall, with supervised machine learning (ML). Our study
covers twelve facility types, including 100G lines and ETH10G clients. We show
that the precision for a given network improves when training on multiple
networks simultaneously relative to training on an individual network.
Furthermore, we show that it is possible to forecast LOS from all facility
types and all networks with a single model, whereas fine-tuning for a
particular facility or network only brings modest improvements. Hence our ML
models remain effective for optical networks previously unknown to the model,
which makes them usable for commercial applications.

resource-intensive and complex, lacks comprehensive central information

Management Framework based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that
would tackle these challenges and automate repetitive tasks, reducing the
policy analysis process from weeks to minutes. Our framework was designed in
collaboration with policy analysis experts and made to be platform-, language-
and policy-agnostic. In this paper, we describe the design of the NLP pipeline,
review the state-of-the-art methods for each of its components, and discuss the
challenges that rise when building a framework oriented towards policy

affect the fundamental assumptions on the role of organisations (either private

the systems is by handling the prediction of the most likely words to happen
after typing letters or words. It is helpful for people with disabilities due
to disabling people who could type or enter texts at a limited slow speed.
Also, it is beneficial for people with dyslexia and those people who are not
well with spells of words. Though, an input technology, for instance, the next
word suggestion facilitates the typing process in smartphones as an example.
This means that when a user types a word, then the system suggests the next
words to be chosen in which the necessary word by the user. Besides, it can be
used in entertainment as a gam, for example, to determine a target word and
reach it or tackle it within 10 attempts of prediction. Generally, the systems
depend on a text corpus, which was provided in the system to conduct the
prediction. Writing every single word is time-consuming, therefore, it is
vitally important to decrease time consumption by reducing efforts to input
texts in the systems by offering most probable words for the user to select,
this could be done via next word prediction systems. There are several
techniques can be found in literature, which is utilized to conduct a variety
of next word prediction systems by using different approaches. In this paper, a
survey of miscellaneous techniques towards the next word prediction systems
will be addressed. Besides, the evaluation of the prediction systems will be
discussed. Then, a modal technique will be determined to be utilized for the
next word prediction system from the perspective of easiness of implementation
and obtaining a good result.

take into account relativistic effects. Applications and comparisons between
the two distributions were carried out in three situations: i) protons at solar
surface temperature, ii) electrons at Lawson's criterion temperature, and iii)
protons at quasar temperatures. It was found that the value of the ratio
between the rest mass of the particle considered and the temperature of the
system determines the need to consider or not a relativistic treatment for the
velocity distribution function of the system.

on a nucleus in the multi-keV energy range strongly depend on the description
of the screening of the nuclear Coulomb potential as well as on the deformation
of the wave functions of the incoming and outgoing electron in the vicinity of
the nucleus. These cross sections are evaluated at values lower than $10^{-30}$
cm$^2$ which vary by several orders of magnitude according to the models.
Experimental measurements would be required to constrain the models but it is a
real challenge to measure such low cross sections. In this study, we
demonstrate that inelastic electron scattering is the main nuclear excitation
mechanism in a $^{181}$Ta target irradiated with a new intense 10 - 30 keV
electron beam produced with a biased laser-plasma. Calculations show that
through the detection of conversion electrons, it should be possible to measure
the nuclear excitation yields. The effect of electron beam heating and of
plasma deposition on the tantalum target are quantified, thus allowing the
dimensioning of a possible experimental configuration to study $(e,e')$
processes in this range of energy for the first time.
