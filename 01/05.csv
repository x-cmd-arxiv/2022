simulation of topological insulators, the gain/loss effects on these systems
should be evaluated when considering the measurement or the coupling to the
environment. Here, incorporating the mature gain/loss techniques into the
experimentally realized spin-orbit coupled ultracold atoms in two-dimensional
optical lattices, we investigate the corresponding non-Hermitian tight-binding
model and evaluate the gain/loss effects on various properties of the system,
revealing the interplay of the non-Hermiticity and the spin-orbit coupling.
Under periodic boundary conditions, we analytically obtain the topological
phase diagram, which undergoes a non-Hermitian gapless interval instead of a
point that the Hermitian counterpart encounters for a topological phase
transition. We also unveil that the band inversion is just a necessary but not
sufficient condition for a topological phase in two-level spin-orbit coupled
non-Hermitian systems. Because the nodal loops of the upper or lower two
dressed bands of the Hermitian counterpart can be split into exceptional loops
in this non-Hermitian model, a gauge-independent Wilson-loop method is
developed for numerically calculating the Chern number of multiple degenerate
complex bands. Under open boundary conditions, we find that the conventional
bulk-boundary correspondence does not break down with only on-site gain/loss
due to the lack of non-Hermitian skin effect, but the dissipation of chiral
edge states depends on the boundary selection, which may be used in the control
of edge-state dynamics. Given the technical accessibility of state-dependent
atom loss, this model could be realized in current cold-atom experiments.

astrophysics. Their innermost regions are impervious to light propagation and
gravitational waves mostly carry global aspects of stars, meaning that only
indirect inferences of their interiors could be obtained. Here we assume a
hypothetical future scenario in which an equation of state softening due to a
phase transition is identified and estimate the observational accuracy to
differentiate a sharp phase transition from a smoother one (associated with a
mixed phase/state due to the unknown value of the surface tension of dense
matter) in a region of a hybrid star by means of some electromagnetic and
gravitational wave observables. We show that different transition constructions
lead to similar sequences of stellar configurations due to their shared
thermodynamic properties. In the most optimistic case - a strong quark-hadron
density jump phase transition - radius observations require fractional
uncertainties smaller than $1\%-2\%$ to differentiate mixed states from sharp
phase transitions. For tidal deformabilities, relative uncertainties should be
smaller than $5\%-10\%$. However, for masses around the onset of stable quark
cores, relative tidal deformability differences associated with strong sharp
phase transitions and mixed states could be much larger (up to around
$20\%-30\%$). All the above suggests that 2.5- and 3rd generation gravitational
wave detectors and near-term electromagnetic missions may be able to start
assessing some particular aspects of phase transitions in neutron stars. In
addition, it points to some limitations on the equation of state recovery using
typical neutron star observables and the impact of systematic uncertainties on
modellings of the equation of state of hybrid stars. Finally, we briefly
discuss other observables that may also be relevant for the probe of mixed
states in stars.

completely different if topotactic hydrogen is present or the oxygen reduction

the superconducting $T_c$ vs. Sr-doping $x$ phase diagram prior to experiment

determine quantity as $T_c$, the agreement with experiment is astonishingly
good. The prediction that $T_c$ is enhanced with pressure or compressive

community has shown that PAD systems are also vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work have studied
the robustness of full voice biometrics systems (ASV + PAD) to these new types

adversarial biometrics transformation network (ABTN) which jointly processes
the loss of the PAD and ASV systems in order to generate white-box and
black-box adversarial \textit{spoofing} attacks. The core idea of this system
is to generate adversarial \textit{spoofing} attacks which are able to fool the
PAD system without being detected by the ASV system. The experiments were
carried out on the ASVspoof 2019 corpus, including both logical access (LA) and

ABTN clearly outperforms some well-known adversarial techniques in both

audio sample, but do not monitor disease progression in COVID-19. Limited
exploration has been put forward to continuously monitor COVID-19 progression,
especially recovery, through longitudinal audio data. Tracking disease
progression characteristics could lead to more timely treatment.
  The primary objective of this study is to explore the potential of
longitudinal audio samples over time for COVID-19 progression prediction and,
especially, recovery trend prediction using sequential deep learning
techniques.
  Crowdsourced respiratory audio data, including breathing, cough, and voice
samples, from 212 individuals over 5-385 days were analyzed. We developed a
deep learning-enabled tracking tool using gated recurrent units (GRUs) to
detect COVID-19 progression by exploring the audio dynamics of the individuals'
historical audio biomarkers. The investigation comprised 2 parts: (1) COVID-19
detection in terms of positive and negative (healthy) tests, and (2)
longitudinal disease progression prediction over time in terms of probability
of positive tests.
  The strong performance for COVID-19 detection, yielding an AUROC of 0.79, a
sensitivity of 0.75, and a specificity of 0.71 supported the effectiveness of
the approach compared to methods that do not leverage longitudinal dynamics. We
further examined the predicted disease progression trajectory, displaying high
consistency with test results with a correlation of 0.75 in the test cohort and
0.86 in a subset of the test cohort who reported recovery. Our findings suggest
that monitoring COVID-19 evolution via longitudinal audio data has potential in
the tracking of individuals' disease progression and recovery.

opinion on the role of discrete and continuous representations and their
processing in the deep learning field. Current neural network models compute
continuous-valued data. Information is compressed into dense, distributed
embeddings. By stark contrast, humans use discrete symbols in their
communication with language. Such symbols represent a compressed version of the
world that derives its meaning from shared contextual information.
Additionally, human reasoning involves symbol manipulation at a cognitive
level, which facilitates abstract reasoning, the composition of knowledge and
understanding, generalization and efficient learning. Motivated by these
insights, in this paper we argue that combining discrete and continuous
representations and their processing will be essential to build systems that
exhibit a general form of intelligence. We suggest and discuss several avenues
that could improve current neural networks with the inclusion of discrete
elements to combine the advantages of both types of representations.

has opened an interesting research line on provable techniques capable of
quantifying the robustness of a given input. In this regard, the Euclidean
distance of the input from the classification boundary denotes a well-proved
robustness assessment as the minimal affordable adversarial perturbation.
Unfortunately, computing such a distance is highly complex due the non-convex
nature of NNs. Despite several methods have been proposed to address this
issue, to the best of our knowledge, no provable results have been presented to
estimate and bound the error committed. This paper addresses this issue by
proposing two lightweight strategies to find the minimal adversarial

allows formulating an error estimation theory of the approximate distance with
respect to the theoretical one. Finally, a substantial set of experiments is
reported to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and support the
theoretical findings. The obtained results show that the proposed strategies
approximate the theoretical distance for samples close to the classification
boundary, leading to provable robustness guarantees against any adversarial

assessment would differentiate strong null results that suggest a negligible
effect size from weak null results that suggest a broad range of potential
effect sizes. We propose the most difference in means ($\delta_M$) as a
two-sample statistic that can both quantify null strength and perform a
hypothesis test for negligible effect size. To facilitate consensus when
interpreting results, our statistic allows scientists to conclude that a result

graphene has recently emerged as the next-generation of DNA sequencing
technology. Owing to its commercial availability and remarkable physical and
conductive properties, graphene has been widely investigated for DNA sequencing
by several theoretical and experimental groups. Despite this progress,
sequencing using graphene remains a major challenge. This is due to the
hydrophobic nature of graphene, which causes DNA bases to stick to its surface
via strong {\pi}-{\pi} interactions, reducing translocation speed and
increasing error rates. To circumvent this challenge, the scientific community
has turned its attention to other 2D materials beyond graphene. One such
material is phosphorene. In this article, we performed first-principle
computational studies using density functional theory (DFT) to evaluate the
ability of phosphorene to distinguish individual DNA bases using two detection
principles, namely, nanopore and nanoribbon modalities. We observe that binding
energies of DNA bases are lower in phosphorene compared to graphene. The energy
gap modulations due to interaction with DNA bases are very significant in
phosphorene compared to graphene. Our studies show that phosphorene is superior
to graphene, and hence a promising alternative for electronic DNA sequencing.

document the existence of a deep and close stochastic relationship between

between these two common models, the PAM can generate additional offspring,
interpolating between ABP and AOUP dynamics, that could provide more suitable

execution is promising for solving cooperative multi-agent reinforcement tasks.
One of the approaches in this area, QMIX, has become state-of-the-art and
achieved the best performance on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.
However, the monotonic-mixing of per agent estimates in QMIX is known to
restrict the joint action Q-values it can represent, as well as the
insufficient global state information for single agent value function
estimation, often resulting in suboptimality. To this end, we present LSF-SAC,
a novel framework that features a variational inference-based
information-sharing mechanism as extra state information to assist individual
agents in the value function factorization. We demonstrate that such latent
individual state information sharing can significantly expand the power of
value function factorization, while fully decentralized execution can still be
maintained in LSF-SAC through a soft-actor-critic design. We evaluate LSF-SAC
on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and demonstrate that it
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in challenging collaborative
tasks. We further set extensive ablation studies for locating the key factors
accounting for its performance improvements. We believe that this new insight

problem definition is itself ambiguous. This work presents ExAID (Explainable
AI for Dermatology), a novel framework for biomedical image analysis, providing
multi-modal concept-based explanations consisting of easy-to-understand textual
explanations supplemented by visual maps justifying the predictions. ExAID
relies on Concept Activation Vectors to map human concepts to those learnt by
arbitrary Deep Learning models in latent space, and Concept Localization Maps
to highlight concepts in the input space. This identification of relevant
concepts is then used to construct fine-grained textual explanations
supplemented by concept-wise location information to provide comprehensive and
coherent multi-modal explanations. All information is comprehensively presented
in a diagnostic interface for use in clinical routines. An educational mode
provides dataset-level explanation statistics and tools for data and model
exploration to aid medical research and education. Through rigorous
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of ExAID, we show the utility of
multi-modal explanations for CAD-assisted scenarios even in case of wrong

screening tool that they both understand and trust. Moreover, it will be the

detect most other retinal vascular diseases is the limited amount of data

experimental results demonstrate that our DR-pretrained approach dominates in
all metrics the conventional ImageNet-pretrained transfer learning approach,
currently adopted in medical image analysis. Moreover, our approach is more
robust with respect to the stochasticity in the training process and with
respect to reduced training samples. This study suggests the potential of our
proposed transfer learning approach for a broad range of retinal vascular

The interplay of these two factors is particularly demanding because large

using a multi-stage approach that explicitly disentangles these two strategies
within each episode. Our algorithm, called eXploit-Then-eXplore (XTX), begins
each episode using an exploitation policy that imitates a set of promising
trajectories from the past, and then switches over to an exploration policy
aimed at discovering novel actions that lead to unseen state spaces. This
policy decomposition allows us to combine global decisions about which parts of
the game space to return to with curiosity-based local exploration in that
space, motivated by how a human may approach these games. Our method
significantly outperforms prior approaches by 27% and 11% average normalized

Navigation Incompatibility (ENI) metric that can be used to measure the
complexity of performing simultaneous navigation. We demonstrate applications
of ENI for highlighting regions of incompatibility for a pair of environments,
guiding the design of the virtual environments to make them more compatible
with a fixed physical environment, and evaluating the performance of different
redirected walking controllers. We validate the ENI metric using simulations
and two user studies. Results of our simulations and user studies show that in
the environment pair that our metric identified as more navigable, users were
able to walk for longer before colliding with objects in the physical

identify regions of high and low compatibility in physical and virtual

task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in
diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the
malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs)
approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation.
The popular ""U-shaped"" network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art
performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and
across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of
convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range
information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the
segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer
models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range
information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and
computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their
variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers
(Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is
reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal
input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to
a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder
extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows
for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each
resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021
segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing
approaches in the validation phase. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr

be observed with the same attenuation setup as the Sun. Additionally, for wide
field-of-view (FoV) instruments like the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
calibrator observations are generally done when the Sun is below the horizon to
avoid the contamination from solar emissions. These considerations imply that
the usual radio interferometric approach to flux density calibration is not
applicable for solar imaging. A novel technique, relying on a good sky model
and detailed characterization of the MWA hardware, was developed for solar flux
density calibration for MWA. Though successful, this technique is not general
enough to be extended to the data from the extended configuration of the MWA
Phase II. Here, we present a robust flux density calibration method for solar
observations with MWA independent of the array configuration. We use different
approaches -- the serendipitous presence of strong sources; detection of
numerous background sources using high dynamic range images in the FoV along
with the Sun and observations of strong flux density calibrators with and
without the additional attenuation used for solar observations; to obtain the
flux scaling parameters required for the flux density calibration. Using the
present method, we have achieved an absolute flux density uncertainty
$\sim10\%$ for solar observations even in the absence of dedicated calibrator
observations.

their remote work hours outside of the home at cafes, co-working spaces or the

underestimation of carbon emissions from commute-based travel demand by 470

general, when one considers two co-dimensional thick brane-worlds, the warp
factor is constructed as a string-like defect. Considering a twofold-warp
factor constructed from two intersecting warp factors, an alternative bulk
configuration is examined. With the brane localization thus driven by two
crossing scalar fields, the possible solvable models obtained from such a two
co-dimensional setup are systematically discussed. The obtained solutions are
classified as five different models organized into two subsets for which some
of their physical properties are evaluated. For models $I$ and $II$, in the
first subset, Einstein equation solutions are rigidly defined, up to some
arbitrary constant. For models $III$, $IV$ and $V$, in the second subset, an
additional degree of freedom not constrained by Einstein equations is admitted.
The solutions are all obtained from a departure statement of assuming a
conformally flat metric for the internal space, which is concomitant to the
proper choice of coordinates. Eventual singularities in the curvature are
identified, however, without affecting the physical appeal of the solutions
described in terms of the stress energy tensor patterns, which are shown to be
free of singularities for model $IV$, besides admitting straightforward
reductions to $(4+1)$-dimensions. In particular, from the framework of models
$III$ and $IV$, one is able to achieve brane-world solutions over two different
geometries of $\mathbb{S}^{2}$ which, as demonstrated, can be reduced to
trivial and non-trivial extensions of the well-known $(4+1)$-dimensional

  We propose the first data structure that supports both suffix array queries
and text updates in $O({\rm polylog}\,n)$ time (achieving $O(\log^4 n)$ and
$O(\log^{3+o(1)} n)$ time, respectively). Our data structure is deterministic
and the running times for all operations are worst-case. In addition to the
standard single-character edits (character insertions, deletions, and
substitutions), we support (also in $O(\log^{3+o(1)} n)$ time) the ""cut-paste""
operation that moves any (arbitrarily long) substring of $T$ to any place in
$T$. We complement our structure by a hardness result: unless the Online

$O({\rm polylog}\,n)$-time suffix array queries can support the ""copy-paste""
operation in $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ time for any $\epsilon>0$.

problem for accelerating the simulation of complicated physics. Machine
learning provides promising tools to construct constitutive models based on
various calibration data. In this work, we propose a neural operator to develop
nonlocal constitutive models for tensorial quantities through a vector-cloud
neural network with equivariance (VCNN-e). The VCNN-e respects all the
invariance properties desired by constitutive models, faithfully reflects the
region of influence in physics, and is applicable to different spatial
resolutions. By design, the model guarantees that the predicted tensor is
invariant to the frame translation and ordering (permutation) of the
neighboring points. Furthermore, it is equivariant to the frame rotation, i.e.,
the output tensor co-rotates with the coordinate frame. We evaluate the VCNN-e
by using it to emulate the Reynolds stress transport model for turbulent flows,
which directly computes the Reynolds stress tensor to close the
Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) equations. The evaluation is performed
in two situations: (1) emulating the Reynolds stress model through synthetic
data generated from the Reynolds stress transport equations with closure
models, and (2) predicting the Reynolds stress by learning from data generated
from direct numerical simulations. Such a priori evaluations of the proposed
network pave the way for developing and calibrating robust and nonlocal,
non-equilibrium closure models for the RANS equations.

machine learning experts to decide learning tasks, data, models, optimization

learning, where human learners select learning tasks and materials on their own
without requiring hands-on guidance, has been shown to be more effective than
passive teacher-guided learning. Inspired by the concept of self-directed human
learning, we introduce the principal concept of Self-directed Machine Learning
(SDML) and propose a framework for SDML. Specifically, we design SDML as a
self-directed learning process guided by self-awareness, including internal
awareness and external awareness. Our proposed SDML process benefits from self
task selection, self data selection, self model selection, self optimization
strategy selection and self evaluation metric selection through self-awareness
without human guidance. Meanwhile, the learning performance of the SDML process
serves as feedback to further improve self-awareness. We propose a mathematical
formulation for SDML based on multi-level optimization. Furthermore, we present
case studies together with potential applications of SDML, followed by
discussing future research directions. We expect that SDML could enable
machines to conduct human-like self-directed learning and provide a new

various techniques have been proposed for LF acquisition, achieving both
angularly and spatially high-resolution LF remains a technology challenge. In
this paper, a learning-based approach applied to 3D epipolar image (EPI) is
proposed to reconstruct high-resolution LF. Through a 2-stage super-resolution
framework, the proposed approach effectively addresses various LF
super-resolution (SR) problems, i.e., spatial SR, angular SR, and
angular-spatial SR. While the first stage provides flexible options to
up-sample EPI volume to the desired resolution, the second stage, which
consists of a novel EPI volume-based refinement network (EVRN), substantially
enhances the quality of the high-resolution EPI volume. An extensive evaluation
on 90 challenging synthetic and real-world light field scenes from 7 published
datasets shows that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
to a large extend for both spatial and angular super-resolution problem, i.e.,
an average peak signal to noise ratio improvement of more than 2.0 dB, 1.4 dB,

respectively. The reconstructed 4D light field demonstrates a balanced
performance distribution across all perspective images and presents superior
visual quality compared to the previous works.

Tracking (MOT), which often leads to inferior tracking results due to the
missing detected objects. The common practice in multi-object tracking is
re-identifying the missed objects after their reappearance. Though tracking
performance can be boosted by the re-identification, the annotation of identity
is required to train the model. In addition, such practice of re-identification
still can not track those highly occluded objects when they are missed by the
detector. In this paper, we focus on online multi-object tracking and design
two novel modules, the unsupervised re-identification learning module and the
occlusion estimation module, to handle these problems. Specifically, the
proposed unsupervised re-identification learning module does not require any
(pseudo) identity information nor suffer from the scalability issue. The
proposed occlusion estimation module tries to predict the locations where
occlusions happen, which are used to estimate the positions of missed objects
by the detector. Our study shows that, when applied to state-of-the-art MOT
methods, the proposed unsupervised re-identification learning is comparable to
supervised re-identification learning, and the tracking performance is further
improved by the proposed occlusion estimation module.

consider the gravitational wave signal from the binary black hole merger
GW200129_065458 (henceforth referred to as GW200129), which has been shown to

CO-rich galaxies in more massive clusters at similar redshifts (have similar

learning can provide a fast and systematic way to search for new scaling

symbolic regression (SR), which models patterns in a dataset in the form of

$M$ by $\sim 20-30$\% for large clusters ($M\gtrsim 10^{14}\, h^{-1} \,

fact that, differently from time stepping methods, like Runge-Kutta
integrators, the Laplace transform allows to compute the solution directly at a
given instant, which can be done by approximating the contour integral
associated to the inverse Laplace transform by a suitable quadrature formula.
In terms of some classical MOR methodology, this determines a significant
improvement in the reduction phase - like the one based on the classical proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) - since the number of vectors to which the
decomposition applies is drastically reduced as it does not contain all
intermediate solutions generated along an integration grid by a time stepping
method. We show the effectiveness of the method by some illustrative parabolic

attempting to fit spreads -- and as we discuss here, the Z-spread is unsuitable

considered as distinct disciplines. This situation is changing by the progress
in cavity QED materials. Motivated by these advances we aim to bridge these
fields by merging fundamental concepts coming from both sides. In the first
part of the thesis we present how non-relativistic QED can be constructed and
we discuss the light-matter interaction in different gauges and that neglecting
particular quadratic terms can lead to instabilities. In the second part, we
revisit the Sommerfeld model of the free electron gas in cavity QED and provide
the analytic solution for this paradigmatic system coupled to the cavity. We
show that the cavity field modifies the optical conductivity of the electron
gas and suppresses its Drude peak. Further, by constructing an effective field
theory in the continuum of photon modes we show how the photon field leads to a
many-body renormalization of the electron mass, which modifies the fermionic
quasiparticle excitations of the Fermi liquid. In the last part, we show that
translational symmetry for periodic materials in homogeneous magnetic fields
can be restored by embedding the problem into QED. This leads to a
generalization of Bloch's theory for electron-photon systems, that we named as
QED-Bloch theory, which can be applied for the description of periodic
materials in homogeneous magnetic fields and strongly coupled to the quantized
cavity field. As a first application we consider Landau levels coupled to a
cavity and we show that quasiparticle excitations between Landau levels and
photons appear, called Landau polaritons. Further, for periodic materials in
such setups, QED-Bloch theory predicts the emergence of novel fractal
polaritonic energy spectra, which we name as fractal polaritons. The fractal
polaritons are a polaritonic, QED analogue of the Hofstadter butterfly.

data of irradiated sodium chloride and the observations, including a $\sim$10
nm shift in central wavelength of the F-center band and the lack of the
prominent 720 nm absorption on Europa from M-centers, which result from the
coalescence of pairs of F-centers. Here, we perform irradiation experiments on
sodium chloride in an attempt to understand these discrepancies. We show that
careful control of the temperature of the sample at a temperature of 120 K
yields F-centers with an absorption wavelength comparable to that of Europa. In
addition, we measure the effect of photobleaching -- the destruction of
F-centers by photons -- and show that at the energetic particle and photon flux
on Europa, an equilibrium will be reached where only a modest F-center
absorption develops. The density of F-centers never reaches high enough values
for the creation of secondary M-centers. Our experiments predict that F-centers
grow during the night on Europa in the absence of photobleaching and then
partially decay during the daytime. We show observations from the Hubble Space
Telescope consistent with this prediction. All observations of the 450 nm
F-center on Europa are now consistent with laboratory measurements of sodium
chloride, confirming the presence of this salt on Europa.

in a doubly-strange hypernucleus; this constraint is, however, not stringent
enough to exclude a stable S. We develop strategies to discover it. A stable S

variables (RVs) is a well-known problem encountered in many challenging
applications. Generally, closed-form expressions of these quantities are out of
reach. A naive Monte Carlo simulation is an alternative approach. However, this
method requires numerous samples for rare event problems. Therefore, it is
paramount to use variance reduction techniques to develop fast and efficient
estimation methods. In this work, we use importance sampling (IS), known for
its efficiency in requiring fewer computations to achieve the same accuracy
requirements. We propose a state-dependent IS scheme based on a stochastic
optimal control formulation, where the control is dependent on state and time.
We aim to calculate rare event quantities that could be written as an
expectation of a functional of the sums of independent RVs. The proposed
algorithm is generic and can be applied without restrictions on the univariate
distributions of RVs or the functional applied to the sum. We apply this
approach to the log-normal distribution to compute the left tail and cumulative
distribution of the ratio of independent RVs. For each case, we numerically
demonstrate that the proposed state-dependent IS algorithm compares favorably
to most well-known estimators dealing with similar problems.

  Almost-Quadratic Runtime in 2D",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a polyline on $n$ vertices, the polyline simplification problem asks
for a minimum size subsequence of these vertices defining a new polyline whose
distance to the original polyline is at most a given threshold under some
distance measure, usually the local Hausdorff or the local Fr\'echet distance.
Here, local means that, for each line segment of the simplified polyline, only
the distance to the corresponding sub-curve in the original polyline is
measured.
  Melkman and O'Rourke [Computational Morphology '88] introduced a geometric
data structure to solve polyline simplification under the local Hausdorff
distance in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time, and Guibas, Hershberger, Mitchell, and
Snoeyink [Int. J. Comput. Geom. Appl. '93] considered polyline simplification
under the Fr\'echet distance as ordered stabbing and provided an algorithm with
a running time of $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$, but they did not restrict the simplified
polyline to use only vertices of the original polyline.
  We show that their techniques can be adjusted to solve polyline
simplification under the local Fr\'echet distance in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time
instead of $O(n^3)$ when applying the Imai--Iri algorithm. Our algorithm may
serve as a more efficient subroutine for multiple other algorithms. We provide
a simple algorithm description as well as rigorous proofs to substantiate this
theorem. We also investigate the geometric data structure introduced by Melkman
and O'Rourke, which we refer to as wavefront, in more detail and feature some
interesting properties. As a result, we can prove that under the L$_1$ and the
L$_\infty$ norm, the algorithm can be significantly simplified and then only
requires a running time of $O(n^2)$. We also define a natural class of
polylines where our algorithm always achieves this running time also in the
Euclidean norm L$_2$.

progress into esophageal disorders. Therefore, understanding the physics behind
the opening and closing cycle of the EGJ provides a mechanistic insight into
its function and can help identify the underlying conditions that cause its
degradation. Using clinical FLIP data, we plotted the pressure-area hysteresis
at the EGJ location and distinguished two major loop types, a pressure dominant
loop (PDL) and a tone dominant loop (TDL). In this study, we aimed to identify
the key characteristics that define each loop type and find what causes the
inversion from one loop to another. To do so, the clinical observations were
reproduced using 1D simulations of flow inside a FLIP device located in the
esophagus, and the work done by the EGJ wall over time was calculated. This
work was decomposed into active and passive components, which revealed the
competing mechanisms that dictate the loop type. These mechanisms are esophagus
stiffness, fluid viscosity, and the EGJ relaxation pattern. In PDL, the leading
source of energy in the cycle is coming from the fluid pressure increase from
the peristaltic contraction wave, and in TDL the leading source of energy in
the cycle is coming from the contraction and relaxation of the EGJ tone.

the heterogeneous causal effects of high-dimensional treatments, which poses
unique challenges in terms of estimation and interpretation. The proposed
approach is based on a Bayesian mixture of regularized logistic regressions to
identify groups of units who exhibit similar patterns of treatment effects. By
directly modeling cluster membership with covariates, the proposed methodology
allows one to explore the unit characteristics that are associated with
different patterns of treatment effects. Our motivating application is conjoint
analysis, which is a popular survey experiment in social science and marketing
research and is based on a high-dimensional factorial design. We apply the
proposed methodology to the conjoint data, where survey respondents are asked
to select one of two immigrant profiles with randomly selected attributes. We
find that a group of respondents with a relatively high degree of prejudice
appears to discriminate against immigrants from non-European countries like
Iraq. An open-source software package is available for implementing the
proposed methodology.

the ability to not just recover balance and maintain stability but also to fall

associated with bipedal locomotion, such as humanoid robots and assistive
robotic devices that aid humans in walking, designing controllers which can
provide this stability and safety can prevent damage to robots or prevent
injury related medical costs. This is a challenging task because it involves
generating highly dynamic motion for a high-dimensional, non-linear and
under-actuated system with contacts. Despite prior advancements in using
model-based and optimization methods, challenges such as requirement of
extensive domain knowledge, relatively large computational time and limited
robustness to changes in dynamics still make this an open problem. In this

synthesizing push recovery control policies for two different kinds of robots :
Humanoid robots and assistive robotic devices that assist in bipedal

Learning safe falling and fall prevention strategies for humanoid robots and 2)
Learning fall prevention strategies for humans using a robotic assistive

determine the language present in a speech sample. SLR is an important task in
its own right, for example, as a tool to analyze or categorize large amounts of
multi-lingual data. Further, it is also an essential tool for selecting
downstream applications in a work flow, for example, to chose appropriate
speech recognition or machine translation models. SLR systems are usually
composed of two stages, one where an embedding representing the audio sample is
extracted and a second one which computes the final scores for each language.
In this work, we approach the SLR task as a detection problem and implement the
second stage as a probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) model. We
show that discriminative training of the PLDA parameters gives large gains with
respect to the usual generative training. Further, we propose a novel
hierarchical approach where two PLDA models are trained, one to generate scores
for clusters of highly-related languages and a second one to generate scores
conditional to each cluster. The final language detection scores are computed
as a combination of these two sets of scores. The complete model is trained
discriminatively to optimize a cross-entropy objective. We show that this
hierarchical approach consistently outperforms the non-hierarchical one for
detection of highly related languages, in many cases by large margins. We train
our systems on a collection of datasets including over 100 languages, and test
them both on matched and mismatched conditions, showing that the gains are
robust to condition mismatch.

way be written as a sum of a positive multiplication operator, the collision

monatomic single species is a classical result, while corresponding result for
mixtures is more recently obtained. In this work the compactness of the
operator for polyatomic single species, where the polyatomicity is modeled by a
discrete internal energy variable, is studied. With a probabilistic formulation
of the collision operator as a starting point, compactness is obtained by
proving that the integral operator is a sum of Hilbert-Schmidt integral
operators and approximately Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators, under some
assumptions on the collision kernel. Self-adjointness of the linearized
collision operator follows. Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the
collision frequency are obtained for a hard sphere model. Then it follows that
the linearized collision operator is a Fredholm operator.
  The results can be extended to mixtures. For brevity, only the case of
mixtures for monatomic species is accounted for.

compared to SDSS-II results in a factor-of-two increase in signal to noise. We
combine these data sets with a model for the optical/far-infrared correlation
that accounts for self-absorption by dust. The spectral features of the DGL
agree remarkably well with features present in stellar spectra. There is
evidence for a difference in the DGL continuum between the regions covered by
BOSS in the northern and southern Galactic hemisphere. We interpret the
difference at red wavelengths as the result of a difference in stellar
populations, with mainly old stars in both regions but a higher fraction of
young stars in the south. There is also a broad excess in the southern DGL
spectrum over the prediction of a simple radiative transfer model, without a
clear counterpart in the north. We interpret this excess, centered at ~6500 A,
as evidence for luminescence in the form of extended red emission (ERE). The
observed strength of the 4000 A break indicates that at most ~7% of the

applications including cryptographic algorithms, scientific simulations, and
industrial testing tools. True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) produce truly
random data by sampling a physical entropy source that typically requires
custom hardware and suffers from long latency. To enable high-bandwidth and
low-latency TRNGs on commodity devices, recent works propose TRNGs that use
DRAM as an entropy source. Although prior works demonstrate promising
DRAM-based TRNGs, integration of such mechanisms into real systems poses
challenges. We identify three challenges for using DRAM-based TRNGs in current
systems: (1) generating random numbers can degrade system performance by
slowing down concurrently-running applications due to the interference between
RNG and regular memory operations in the memory controller (i.e., RNG
interference), (2) this RNG interference can degrade system fairness by
unfairly prioritizing applications that intensively use random numbers (i.e.,
RNG applications), and (3) RNG applications can experience significant
slowdowns due to the high RNG latency. We propose DR-STRaNGe, an end-to-end
system design for DRAM-based TRNGs that (1) reduces the RNG interference by
separating RNG requests from regular requests in the memory controller, (2)
improves the system fairness with an RNG-aware memory request scheduler, and
(3) hides the large TRNG latencies using a random number buffering mechanism
with a new DRAM idleness predictor that accurately identifies idle DRAM

case of rectangular lattice. We start from the original Buot definition of the
symbol of operator. This definition is corrected in order to maintain
self-consistency of the algebraic constructions. It appears, however, that the
Buot symbol for simple operators does not have a regular limit when the lattice
size tends to infinity. Therefore, using a more dense auxiliary lattice we
modify the Buot symbol of operator in order to build our new discrete Weyl
symbol. The latter obeys several useful identities inherited from the continuum
theory. Besides, the limit of infinitely large lattice becomes regular. We
formulate Keldysh technique for the lattice models using the proposed Weyl
symbols of operators. Within this technique the simple expression for the
electric conductivity of a two dimensional non - equilibrium and non -

theories with a local $S$-matrix and enhanced symmetries and soft behavior. The
exploration is carried out using both conventional quantum field theory methods
based on symmetry arguments, and recently developed on-shell recursion
relations. We show that, in contrary to relativistic theories, enhancement of
the soft limit of scattering amplitudes in nonrelativistic theories is
generally not a byproduct of symmetry alone, but requires additional low-energy
data. Sufficient conditions for enhanced scattering amplitudes can be derived
by combining symmetries and dispersion relations of the scattered particles.
This has direct consequences for the infrared dynamics that different types of
nonrelativistic Nambu-Goldstone bosons can exhibit. We then use a bottom-up
soft bootstrap approach to narrow down the landscape of nonrelativistic
effective field theories that possess a consistent low-energy $S$-matrix. We
recover two exceptional theories of a complex Schr\""odinger-type scalar, namely
the $\mathbb{C} P^1$ nonlinear sigma model and the
Schr\""odinger-Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. Moreover, we use soft recursion to
prove a no-go theorem ruling out the existence of other exceptional
Schr\""odinger-type theories. We also prove that all exceptional theories of a
single real scalar with a linear dispersion relation are necessarily
Lorentz-invariant. Soft recursion allows us to obtain some further general
bounds on the landscape of nonrelativistic effective theories with enhanced
soft limits. Finally, we present a novel theory of a complex scalar with a
technically natural quartic dispersion relation. Altogether, our work
represents the first step of a program to extend the developments in the study

first models the nonlinear behavior of existing current-mirror-based

different stages shows a dependence on stellar mass and Hubble type of galaxies

localizes the camera/robot by fusing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
sequential images' geometric constraints. The camera is localized using a
single or few observed images and training images with 6-degree-of-freedom pose
labels. A Siamese network structure is adopted to train an image descriptor
network, and the visually similar candidate image in the training set is
retrieved to localize the testing image geometrically. Meanwhile, a
probabilistic motion model predicts the pose based on a constant velocity
assumption. The two estimated poses are finally fused using their uncertainties
to yield an accurate pose prediction. This method leverages the geometric
uncertainty and is applicable in indoor scenarios predominated by diffuse
illumination. Experiments on simulation and real data sets demonstrate the

  Neural Networks: A First Look from the Lens of Robustness","Accepted by the EMSE journal",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
users' data privacy while leveraging the entire dataset of all participants. In
FL, multiple models are trained independently on the clients and aggregated
centrally to update a global model in an iterative process. Although this
approach is excellent at preserving privacy, FL still suffers from quality
issues such as attacks or byzantine faults. Recent attempts have been made to
address such quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL.
However, the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is
still unclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand
the current quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the
presence of attacks and faults, we perform a large-scale empirical study to
investigate the SOTA FL's quality from multiple angles of attacks, simulated
faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense) methods. In
particular, we study FL's performance on the image classification tasks and use
DNNs as our model type. Furthermore, we perform our study on two generic image
datasets and one real-world federated medical image dataset. We also
investigate the effect of the proportion of affected clients and the dataset
distribution factors on the robustness of FL. After a large-scale analysis with
496 configurations, we find that most mutators on each user have a negligible
effect on the final model in the generic datasets, and only one of them is
effective in the medical dataset. Furthermore, we show that model poisoning
attacks are more effective than data poisoning attacks. Moreover, choosing the
most robust FL aggregator depends on the attacks and datasets. Finally, we
illustrate that a simple ensemble of aggregators achieves a more robust
solution than any single aggregator and is the best choice in 75% of the cases.

relationships while enhancing performance on vision tasks, such as image
classification and image captioning. However, the self-attention module highly
relies on the dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among
query-key-value features, which cause two problems: (1) The dot product
multiplication results in exhaustive and redundant computation. (2) Due to the
visual feature map often appearing as a multi-dimensional tensor, reshaping the
scale of the tensor feature to adapt to the dimension alignment might destroy
the internal structure of the tensor feature map. To address these problems,
this paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, namely,
Synthesizing Tensor Transformations (STT), for directly processing image tensor
features. Without computing the dot-product multiplication among
query-key-value, the basic STT is composed of the tensor transformation to
learn the synthetic attention weight from visual information. The effectiveness
of STT series is validated on the image classification and image caption.
Experiments show that the proposed STT achieves competitive performance while
keeping robustness compared to self-attention based above vision tasks.

H$30\alpha$ emission, this structure mainly traces ionised gas. However, there
is evidence for $\sim30$~M$_{\odot}$ of dusty gas near the main mm continuum

virial analysis on scales of $\sim$2,000~au from hot core line emission yields
a dynamical mass of $\sim80\:M_\odot$. A strong velocity gradient in the

drives a larger-scale molecular outflow. An infrared SED analysis indicates a
current protostellar mass of $m_*\sim40\:M_\odot$ forming from a core with
initial mass $M_c\sim300\:M_\odot$ in a clump with mass surface density of
$\Sigma_{\rm cl}\sim 0.8\:{\rm g\:cm}^{-2}$. Thus the SED and other properties

G28.20-0.05 is forming in a relatively isolated environment, with no other
concentrated sources, i.e., protostellar cores, above $\sim 1\:M_\odot$ found
from $\sim$0.1 to 0.4~pc around the source. This implies that a massive star
can form in relative isolation and the dearth of other protostellar companions
within the $\sim1$~pc environs is a strong constraint on massive star formation
theories that predict the presence of a surrounding protocluster.

data mining. Prior work has approached TSC from two major directions: (1)
similarity-based methods that classify time-series based on the nearest

for classification in a data-driven manner. Motivated by the different working
mechanisms within these two research lines, we aim to connect them in such a

This is a challenging task because it is unclear how we should efficiently

Similarity-Aware Time-Series Classification (SimTSC), a conceptually simple and
general framework that models similarity information with graph neural networks

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) collision avoidance problem. Most of these
solutions consider that the ground controller system (GCS) determines the path
of a UAV before starting a particular mission at hand. Furthermore, these
solutions expect the occurrence of collisions based only on the GPS
localization of UAVs as well as via object-detecting sensors placed on board
UAVs. The sensors' sensitivity to environmental disturbances and the UAVs'
influence on their accuracy impact negatively the efficiency of these
solutions. In this vein, this paper proposes a new energy and delay-aware
physical collision avoidance solution for UAVs. The solution is dubbed EDC-UAV.
The primary goal of EDC-UAV is to build inflight safe UAVs trajectories while
minimizing the energy consumption and response time. We assume that each UAV is
equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) sensor to identify its
position. Moreover, we take into account the margin error of the GPS to provide
the position of a given UAV. The location of each UAV is gathered by a cluster
head, which is the UAV that has either the highest autonomy or the greatest
computational capacity. The cluster head runs the EDC-UAV algorithm to control
the rest of the UAVs, thus guaranteeing a collision-free mission and minimizing
the energy consumption to achieve different purposes. The proper operation of
our solution is validated through simulations. The obtained results demonstrate
the efficiency of EDC-UAV in achieving its design goals.

Among the various methods, the representative approach is a method of

with normal data and classifying it as abnormal through a threshold value.
However, if the dataset is imbalanced, even the state-of-the-arts models do not

abnormal features in imbalanced data as features with strong distinction. We
use the features of the autoencoder to train latent vectors from low to high

strong distinction among the features of imbalanced data. We propose a latent

urban scenarios, a game-theoretic decision-making framework is proposed that
can advance social benefits, including the traffic system efficiency and
safety, as well as the benefits of individual users. Under the proposed
decision-making framework, in this work, a representative urban driving
scenario, i.e. the unsignalized intersection, is investigated. Once the vehicle
enters the focused zone, it will interact with other CAVs and make
collaborative decisions. To evaluate the safety risk of surrounding vehicles
and reduce the complexity of the decision-making algorithm, the driving risk
assessment algorithm is designed with a Gaussian potential field approach. The
decision-making cost function is constructed by considering the driving safety
and passing efficiency of CAVs. Additionally, decision-making constraints are
designed and include safety, comfort, efficiency, control and stability. Based
on the cost function and constraints, the fuzzy coalitional game approach is
applied to the decision-making issue of CAVs at unsignalized intersections. Two
types of fuzzy coalitions are constructed that reflect both individual and
social benefits. The benefit allocation in the two types of fuzzy coalitions is
associated with the driving aggressiveness of CAVs. Finally, the effectiveness
and feasibility of the proposed decision-making framework are verified with
three test cases.

structurally stable LON by synthesizing multiple repeats of sampling results.
Finally, exploratory analysis can be conducted on the stable LON from both

their collisions remain elusive. Here we systematically study the minor
collisions between a clumpy galaxy and a satellite on orbits with different

the values of Toomre parameter, $Q$. Interestingly, a thick and knotty ring

Our results provide a promising explanation of the empty ring galaxy recently

reconstruction error: 0.01 dB/cm.MHz^y for attenuation coefficient and 0.05 for
the frequency exponent. For tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex-vivo bovine muscle
samples, a high reconstruction contrast was achieved. Attenuation exponents in
a gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to
be, respectively, 1.3 and 0.6 on average. Linear dispersion of SoS in a
gelatin-cellulose mixture and an ex-vivo bovine muscle sample were found to be,

passengers usually need guidance to find alternative paths. This paper proposes
a path recommendation model to mitigate the congestion during public transit
disruptions. Passengers with different origin-destination and departure times
are recommended with different paths such that the system travel time is
minimized. We model the path recommendation as an optimal flow problem with
uncertain demand information. To tackle the non-analytical formulation of
travel times due to left behind, we propose a simulation-based first-order
approximation to transform the original problem into linear programming.
Uncertainties in demand are modeled with robust optimization to protect the
path recommendation strategies against inaccurate estimates. A real-world rail
disruption scenario in the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) system is used as a
case study. Results show that even without considering uncertainty, the nominal
model can reduce the system travel time by 9.1% (compared to the status quo),
and outperforms the benchmark capacity-based path recommendation. The average
travel time of passengers in the incident line (i.e., passengers receiving
recommendations) is reduced more (-20.6% compared to the status quo). After
incorporating the demand uncertainty, the robust model can further reduce the
system travel time. The best robust model can decrease the average travel time
of incident-line passengers by 2.91% compared to the nominal model.

principle of optimization transfer to derive a neural KEM algorithm. Each
iteration of the algorithm consists of two separate steps: a KEM step for image
update from the projection data and a deep-learning step in the image domain
for updating the kernel coefficient image using the neural network. This

distributions with generalized moment constraints, i.e., the function in the
moment can be any measurable function. These problems have recently attracted
growing interest due to their great flexibility in representing nonstandard
moment constraints, such as geometry-mean constraints, entropy constraints, and
exponential-type moment constraints. Despite the increasing research interest,
analytical solutions are mostly missing for these problems, and researchers
have to settle for nontight bounds or numerical approaches that are either
suboptimal or only applicable to some special cases. In addition, the
techniques used to develop closed-form solutions to the standard moment
problems are tailored for specific problem structures. In this paper, we
propose a framework that provides a unified treatment for any moment problem.
The key ingredient of the framework is a novel primal-dual optimality
condition. This optimality condition enables us to reduce the original infinite
dimensional problem to a nonlinear equation system with a finite number of
variables. In solving three specific moment problems, the framework

Testing results of the copper system show that the optimized code can scale up
to the entire machine of both Fugaku and Summit, and the corresponding system

like our AI agents to adjust their strategy based on the strategies of those
around them. In this work, we study the problem of conditional multi-agent
imitation learning, where we have access to joint trajectory demonstrations at
training time, and we must interact with and adapt to new partners at test
time. This setting is challenging because we must infer a new partner's
strategy and adapt our policy to that strategy, all without knowledge of the
environment reward or dynamics. We formalize this problem of conditional
multi-agent imitation learning, and propose a novel approach to address the
difficulties of scalability and data scarcity. Our key insight is that
variations across partners in multi-agent games are often highly structured,
and can be represented via a low-rank subspace. Leveraging tools from tensor
decomposition, our model learns a low-rank subspace over ego and partner agent
strategies, then infers and adapts to a new partner strategy by interpolating
in the subspace. We experiments with a mix of collaborative tasks, including
bandits, particle, and Hanabi environments. Additionally, we test our
conditional policies against real human partners in a user study on the

localization of small-scale regions-of-interest (ROI) has remained a key
challenge, as discriminative morphologic features often occupy only a small
fraction of a gigapixel-scale whole-slide image (WSI). In this paper, we
propose a sparse WSI analysis method for the rapid identification of high-power
ROI for WSI-level classification. We develop an evaluation framework inspired
by the early classification literature, in order to quantify the tradeoff
between diagnostic performance and inference time for sparse analytic
approaches. We test our method on a common but time-consuming task in pathology
- that of diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) on hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E)-stained slides from endoscopic biopsy specimens. GIM is a
well-known precursor lesion along the pathway to development of gastric cancer.
We performed a thorough evaluation of the performance and inference time of our
approach on a test set of GIM-positive and GIM-negative WSI, finding that our
method successfully detects GIM in all positive WSI, with a WSI-level
classification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
0.98 and an average precision (AP) of 0.95. Furthermore, we show that our
method can attain these metrics in under one minute on a standard CPU. Our
results are applicable toward the goal of developing neural networks that can
easily be deployed in clinical settings to support pathologists in quickly
localizing and diagnosing small-scale morphologic features in WSI.

we propose a novel controller assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning

with a supervised controller that by selectively partitioning the sample space,
triggers intelligent role division among the teammates. Using C-MADDPG as an
underlying framework, we propose an incentive scheme for the weak team such
that the final rewards of both teams become the same. We find that in spite of
the incentive, the final reward of the weak team falls short of the strong

team does not incentivize the weaker agents within that team to learn and
improve. To offset this, we now specially incentivize the weaker player to
learn and as a result, observe that the weak team beyond an initial phase
performs at par with the stronger team. The final goal of the paper has been to
formulate a dynamic incentive scheme that continuously balances the reward of
the two teams. This is achieved by devising an incentive scheme enriched with
an RL agent which takes minimum information from the environment.

extensive toolkit for their creation and control. In contrast, the toolkit for
quantifying their non-separability, the inhomogeneity of the polarisation
structure, is far less developed, and in some cases fails altogether. To
overcome this, here we introduce a new measure for vectorial light, which we
demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally. We consider the general case
where the local polarisation homogeneity can vary spatially across the field,
from scalar to vector, a condition that can arise naturally if the composite
scalar fields are path separable during propagation, leading to spatially
disjoint vectorial light. We show how the new measure correctly accounts for
the local path-like separability of the individual scalar beams, which can have
varying degrees of disjointness, even though the global vectorial field remains
intact. Our work attempts to address a pressing issue in the analysis of such
complex light fields, and raises important questions on spatial coherence in
the context of vectorially polarised light.

parametric amplifier (OPA); however, the squeezing level have been insufficient
for applications of fault-tolerant quantum computation because of degradation
of the squeezing level due to their optical losses caused by the structural
perturbation and pump-induced phenomena. Here, by using mechanical polishing
processes, we fabricated a low-loss quasi-single-mode periodically-poled LiNbO3

length of 45 mm. Using the waveguide, we assembled a low-loss fiber-pigtailed
OPA module with a total insertion loss of 21%. Thanks to its directly bonded
core on a LiTaO3 substrate, the waveguide does not show pump-induced optical
loss even under a condition of hundreds of milliwatts pumping. Furthermore, the
quasi-single-mode structure prohibits excitation of higher-order spatial modes,
and enables us to obtain larger squeezing level. Even with including optical
coupling loss of the modularization, we observe 6.3-dB squeezed light from the
DC component up to a 6.0-THz sideband in a fully fiber-closed optical system.
By excluding the losses due to imperfections of the modularization and

our lives. It is considered as the new electricity that is revolutionizing the
world. AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is
also a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep
learning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are
already visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry
has seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related
disappointments that have followed.
  The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history,
its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of
humans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the
decades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the
current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations
for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main
application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the
development of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision,
and includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research.
Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI.
We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the
topic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding,
explaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present
knowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the
current state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at
the development of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at
our own university.

important component of the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system that helps
motor-disabled people interact with the outside world via external devices. The
main issue in developing the EEG based BCI is the informative confusion due to
the non-stationary characteristics of EEG data. In this work, an innovative
idea of transforming an EEG signal into the weight vector of an unsupervised
neural network called the autoencoder is proposed for the first time to solve
that problem. Separate autoencoders are trained for the individual EEG data.
The weight vectors are then optimized for the individual EEG signals. The EEG
signals are thus represented in a new domain that is in the form of weight
vectors of the individual autoencoder. The weight vectors are then used to
extract features such as autoregressive coefficients (ARs), Shannon entropy
(SE), and wavelet leader. A window-based feature extraction technique is
implemented to capture the local features of the EEG data. Finally, extracted
features are classified using a classifier network. The proposed approach is
tested on two publicly accessible EEG datasets (BCI competition-III and
Competition-IV) to ensure that it is as successful as and superior to the
previously published methods. The proposed technique achieves a mean accuracy
of 95.33 % for dataset-IIIa from BCI-III and a mean accuracy of 97% for
dataset-IIa from BCI-IV for four-class EEG-based MI classification. The
experimental outcomes show that the proposed approach is a promising way to
increase BCI performance.

this approach is a large number of measurements required for accurate sampling
of the observable's expectation value. We consider several partitioning schemes
based on grouping of commuting multi-qubit Pauli products with the goal of
minimizing the number of measurements. Three main directions are explored: 1)
grouping commuting operators using the greedy approach, 2) involving non-local
unitary transformations for measuring, and 3) taking advantage of compatibility
of some Pauli products with several measurable groups. The last direction gives
rise to a general framework that not only provides improvements over previous
methods but also connects measurement grouping approaches with recent advances
in techniques of shadow tomography. Following this direction, we develop two
new measurement schemes that achieve a severalfold reduction in the number of
measurements for a set of model molecules compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods.

is difficult to perform perturbative calculations due to the complexity caused

ordinary perturbation theory may become invalid. Here we consider undoped
graphene as an example and provide a non-perturbative quantum-field-theoretic
analysis of the interplay of electron-phonon interaction and Coulomb
interaction. We treat these two interactions on an equal footing and derive the
exact Dyson-Schwinger integral equation of the full Dirac-fermion propagator.
This equation depends on several complicated correlation functions and thus is
difficult to handle. Fortunately, we find that these correlation functions obey
a number of exact identities, which allows us to prove that the Dyson-Schwinger
equation of the full fermion propagator is self-closed. After solving this
self-closed equation, we obtain the renormalized velocity of Dirac fermions and
show that its energy (momentum) dependence is dominantly determined by the
electron-phonon (Coulomb) interaction. In particular, the renormalized velocity
exhibits a logarithmic momentum dependence and a non-monotonic energy
dependence.

light of the current paradigm of low viscosities in protoplanetary disks that
nevertheless present large accretion rates even in the presence of inner
cavities. The possibility of dust entrainment in these winds may explain recent
scattered light observations and constitutes a way of dust transport towards
outer regions of the disk. We aim to study the dust dynamics in these winds and
explore the differences between photoevaporation and magnetically driven disk
winds in this regard. We quantify maximum entrainable grain sizes, the flow
angle, and the general detectability. We used the FARGO3D code to perform
global, 2.5D axisymmetric, nonideal MHD simulations including ohmic and
ambipolar diffusion. Dust was treated as a pressureless fluid. Synthetic
observations were created with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D. We find a
significant difference in the dust entrainment efficiency of warm, ionized
winds such as photoevaporation and magnetic winds including X-ray and extreme
ultraviolet (XEUV) heating compared to cold magnetic winds. The maximum
entrainable grain size varies from $3\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ to $6\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ for
ionized winds to $1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ for cold magnetic winds. Dust grains in
cold magnetic winds tend to flow along a shallower angle compared to the warm
winds. With increasing distance to the central star, the dust entrainment
efficiency decreases. Larger values of the turbulent viscosity increase the
maximum grain size radius of possible dust entrainment. Our simulations
indicate that diminishing dust content in the outer regions of the wind can be
mainly attributed to the dust settling in the disk. In the synthetic images,
the dusty wind appears as a faint, conical emission region which is brighter
for a cold magnetic wind.

deep learning hardware accelerator. Nonetheless, they suffer from various
noises due to the analog nature of the crossbars. To overcome such limitations,
most previous works train weight parameters with noise data obtained from a
crossbar. These methods are, however, ineffective because it is difficult to
collect noise data in large-volume manufacturing environment where each
crossbar has a large device/circuit level variation. Moreover, we argue that
there is still room for improvement even though these methods somewhat improve
accuracy. This paper explores a new perspective on mitigating crossbar noise in
a more generalized way by manipulating input binary bit encoding rather than
training the weight of networks with respect to noise data. We first
mathematically show that the noise decreases as the number of binary bit
encoding pulses increases when representing the same amount of information. In
addition, we propose Gradient-based Bit Encoding Optimization (GBO) which
optimizes a different number of pulses at each layer, based on our in-depth
analysis that each layer has a different level of noise sensitivity. The
proposed heterogeneous layer-wise bit encoding scheme achieves high noise
robustness with low computational cost. Our experimental results on public
benchmark datasets show that GBO improves the classification accuracy by ~5-40%
in severe noise scenarios.

planning, and control layers, but these layers often inadequately incorporate
inherent perception and prediction uncertainties, either ignoring them
altogether or making questionable assumptions of Gaussianity. Robots with
nonlinear dynamics and complex sensing modalities operating in an uncertain
environment demand more careful consideration of how uncertainties propagate
across stack layers. We propose a framework to integrate perception, motion
planning, and control by explicitly incorporating perception and prediction
uncertainties into planning so that risks of constraint violation can be
mitigated. Specifically, we use a nonlinear model predictive control based
steering law coupled with a decorrelation scheme based Unscented Kalman Filter
for state and environment estimation to propagate the robot state and
environment uncertainties. Subsequently, we use distributionally robust risk
constraints to limit the risk in the presence of these uncertainties. Finally,
we present a layered autonomy stack consisting of a nonlinear steering-based
distributionally robust motion planning module and a reference trajectory
tracking module. Our numerical experiments with nonlinear robot models and an
urban driving simulator show the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.

estimation problem in a massive Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity system,
where a large number of IoT devices exist but merely a random subset of them
become active for short-packet transmission in each coherence block. In
particular, we propose to leverage the temporal correlation in device activity,
e.g., a device active in the previous coherence block is more likely to be
still active in the current coherence block, to improve the detection and
estimation performance. However, it is challenging to utilize this temporal
correlation as side information (SI), which relies on the knowledge about the
exact statistical relation between the estimated activity pattern for the
previous coherence block (which may be imperfect with unknown error) and the
true activity pattern in the current coherence block. To tackle this challenge,
we establish a novel SI-aided multiple measurement vector approximate message
passing (MMV-AMP) framework. Specifically, thanks to the state evolution of the
MMV-AMP algorithm, the correlation between the activity pattern estimated by
the MMV-AMP algorithm in the previous coherence block and the real activity
pattern in the current coherence block is quantified explicitly. Based on the
well-defined temporal correlation, we further manage to embed this useful SI
into the denoiser design under the MMV-AMP framework. Specifically, the
SI-based soft-thresholding denoisers with binary thresholds and the SI-based
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoisers are characterized for the cases
without and with the knowledge of the channel distribution, respectively.
Numerical results are given to show the significant gain in device activity
detection and channel estimation performance brought by our proposed SI-aided
MMV-AMP framework.

light sources for interactive global illumination of dynamic 3D scenes. Virtual
Point Lights (VPL) are an efficient approach to define indirect light sources
and to evaluate the resulting indirect lighting. Nonetheless, VPL suffer from
disturbing artifacts, especially with high frequency materials. Virtual
Spherical Lights (VSL) avoid these artifacts by considering spheres instead of
points but estimates the lighting integral using Monte Carlo which results to
noise in the final image. We define HVL as an extension of VSL in a Spherical
Harmonics (SH) framework, defining a closed form of the lighting integral
evaluation. We propose an efficient SH projection of spherical lights
contribution faster than existing methods. Computing the outgoing luminance
requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ operations when using materials with circular
symmetric lobes, and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ operations for the general case, where
$n$ is the number of SH bands. HVL can be used with either parametric or
measured BRDF without extra cost and offers control over rendering time and
image quality, by either decreasing or increasing the band limit used for SH
projection. Our approach is particularly well designed to render
medium-frequency one-bounce global illumination with arbitrary BRDF in

to learn new class knowledge incrementally without retaining any old samples.
Recently, the framework based on parallel one-class classifiers (POC), which
trains a one-class classifier (OCC) independently for each category, has
attracted extensive attention, since it can naturally avoid catastrophic
forgetting. POC, however, suffers from weak discriminability and comparability
due to its independent training strategy for different OOCs. To meet this
challenge, we propose a new framework, named Discriminative and Comparable
One-class classifiers for Incremental Learning (DisCOIL). DisCOIL follows the
basic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead
of other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a
trained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging
to a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning
new tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with
the old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for
new-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing
the comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss
to ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that DisCOIL achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

intriguing focus in this frontier field. In the present study, the diffusion of
NPs in an unentangled polymer network for different NP radii and network
stiffness is numerically investigated by single particle dissipative particle
dynamics (DPD). It is found that, the deformation due to the junction deviation
contributes significantly to the the potential barrier $U$ for the NP to
overcome during hopping, and it is dominated over the strain energy induced by
loop stretching for larger NPs and lower network rigidity. Analyses based on
the theory of continuum mechanics reveal that the relation between this

directly infer the exact depth due to its discrete prediction. In this paper,
we propose a novel representation, termed Unification, to unify the advantages
of regression and classification. It can directly constrain the cost volume
like classification methods, but also realize the sub-pixel depth prediction
like regression methods. To excavate the potential of unification, we design a
new loss function named Unified Focal Loss, which is more uniform and
reasonable to combat the challenge of sample imbalance. Combining these two
unburdened modules, we present a coarse-to-fine framework, that we call
UniMVSNet. The results of ranking first on both DTU and Tanks and Temples
benchmarks verify that our model not only performs the best but also has the
best generalization ability.

atmosphere is one of the most challenging goals in solar physics. If we account
for all relevant ingredients of the spectral line formation process, such as
the three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer out of local thermodynamic
equilibrium (NLTE), the task becomes extremely computationally expensive.
Instead of generalizing 1D methods to 3D, we have developed a new approach to
the inverse problem. In our meshfree method, we do not consider the requirement
of 3D\,NLTE consistency as an obstacle, but as a natural regularization with
respect to the traditional pixel-by-pixel methods. This leads to more robust
and less ambiguous solutions. We solve the 3D\,NLTE inverse problem as an
unconstrained global minimization problem that avoids repetitive evaluations of
the $\Lambda$ operator. Apart from the 3D\,NLTE consistency, the method allows
us to easily include additional conditions of physical consistency such as the
zero divergence of the magnetic field. Stochastic ingredients make the method
less prone to ending up within the local minima of the loss function. Our
method is capable of solving the inverse problem faster by several orders of
magnitude than by using grid-based methods. The method can provide accurate and
physically consistent results if sufficient computing time is available, along
with approximate solutions in the case of very complex plasma structures or
limited computing time.

developed, serving as a more physically motivated replacement to the

$(0,\infty)$ whose Hamiltonian $H$ is a.e. positive semidefinite, denote by
$q_H$ its Weyl coefficient. De Branges' inverse spectral theorem states that
the assignment $H\mapsto q_H$ is a bijection between trace-normalised
Hamiltonians and Nevanlinna functions. We prove that $q_H$ has an asymptotics
towards $i\infty$ whose leading coefficient is some (complex) multiple of a
regularly varying function if and only if the primitive $M$ of $H$ is regularly
or rapidly varying at $0$ and its off-diagonal entries do not oscillate too
much. The leading coefficient in the asymptotic of $q_H$ towards $i\infty$ is
related to the behaviour of $M$ towards $0$ by explicit formulae. The speed of
growth in absolute value depends only on the diagonal entries of $M$, while the
argument of the leading coefficient corresponds to the relative size of the
off-diagonal entries.

currently witnessing a surge of experimental breakthroughs and theoretical
developments. The main goal of quantum metrology is to estimate unknown
parameters as accurately as possible. By using quantum resources as probes, it
is possible to attain a measurement precision that would be otherwise
impossible using the best classical strategies. For example, with respect to
the task of phase estimation, the maximum precision (the Heisenberg limit) is a
quadratic gain in precision with respect to the best classical strategies. Of
course, quantum metrology is not the sole quantum technology currently
undergoing advances. The theme of this thesis is exploring how quantum
metrology can be enhanced with other quantum techniques when appropriate,
namely: graph states, error correction and cryptography.

have enabled us to study extreme astrophysical phenomena and explore
fundamental physics. A crucial requisite for these studies is to have accurate
signal models with characteristic morphologies, which have been challenging for
many decades, and researchers are still endeavoring to incorporate important
physics. Therefore, morphology-independent methods have been developed for
identifying a signal and its reconstruction. The reconstructed signal allows us
to test the agreement between the observed signal and the waveform posterior
samples from parameter estimation. These methods model observed signals using a
nearly orthogonal wavelet basis in the frame of continuous wavelet
transformation. Here, we propose log-uniform scales to construct the wavelets,
which are are highly redundant (nonorthogonal) compared to the conventional
octave scales but more efficient for reconstructing the signals at high
frequencies. And we introduce a semi-model-dependent reconstruction method
using the posterior samples of the events, where we model the signal using
Gabor-Morlet wavelets with log-uniform scales. We demonstrate the ability to
detect deviation using a numerical simulation of an eccentric binary black hole
merger, where the signal in the data does not belong to the search template
waveform manifold. Finally, we apply this method to each binary black hole
merger event in GWTC-1. We have found that the signal produced by the GW150914
event has 96% agreement with the waveform posterior samples. As the detector
sensitivity improves and the detected population of black hole mergers grows,
we expect the proposed method will provide even stronger tests.

optical and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, with only weak soft X-ray components.
One model for this optical excess proposes that thermal X-ray emission from a
compact accretion disc is reprocessed to longer wavelengths by an optically
thick envelope. Here, we explore this reprocessing scenario in the context of
an optically thick accretion disc wind. Using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo
radiative transfer and ionization software, we produce synthetic UV and optical
spectra for wind and disc-hosting TDEs. Our models are inspired by
observations, spanning a realistic range of accretion rates and wind
kinematics. We find that such outflows can efficiently reprocess the disc
emission and produce the broad Balmer and helium recombination features
commonly seen in TDEs and exhibit asymmetric red wings. Moreover, the
characteristic colour temperature of the reprocessed spectral energy
distribution (SED) is much lower than that of the accretion disc. We show
explicitly how changes in black hole mass, accretion rate and wind properties
affect the observed broadband SED and line spectrum. In general, slower, denser
winds tend to reprocess more radiation and produce stronger Balmer emission.
Most of the outflows we consider are too highly ionized to produce UV
absorption features, but this is sensitive to the input SED. For example,
truncating the inner disc at just 4 $R_{ISCO}$ lowers the wind ionization state
sufficiently to produce UV absorption features for sight lines looking into the
wind

Ce3+ g tensor parameters were obtained as function of Ce concentration. The g
tensor has orthorhombic symmetry even in the trigonal phase (x < 10 at.%)
suggesting that the incorporation of Ce at La site lowers lattice symmetry near
this ion. The local properties of the La1-xCexAlO3 crystals were further
studied by 27Al and 139La high-resolution NMR measurements. It was found that
139La chemical shift has the Fermi contact interaction origin. It linearly
increases with Ce concentration up to 165 ppm at x = 0.5. Due to this strong
Fermi contact interaction, separated peaks corresponding to different Ce-O-La
spin transfer passways are resolved in the 139La NMR spectra. On the other
hand, no Fermi contact interaction is visible in 27Al NMR spectra. However,
these spectra contain satellite peak which intensity linearly increases with
increase of Ce concentration leaving position of this peak unchanged. This was
interpreted as manifestation of crystal structure modification in vicinity of

formulations of inverse Kalman filter (I-KF). In this context of inverse
filtering, we address the key challenges of non-linear process dynamics and
unknown input to the forward filter by proposing an inverse extended Kalman
filter (I-EKF). The purpose of this paper and the companion paper (Part II) is
to develop the theory of I-EKF in detail. In this paper, we assume perfect
system model information and derive I-EKF with and without an unknown input
when both forward and inverse state-space models are non-linear. In the
process, I-KF-with-unknown-input is also obtained. We then provide theoretical
stability guarantees using both bounded non-linearity and unknown matrix
approaches. Numerical experiments validate our methods for various proposed
inverse filters using the recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.
In the companion paper (Part II), we further generalize these formulations to
highly non-linear models and propose reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EKF
to handle incomplete system model information.

Navier-Stokes equations. Focusing on the simplest non-trivial closure (commonly
referred to as CE2) which corresponds to the quasilinearized Navier-Stokes
equations, we develop an extended Orr-Sommerfeld analysis (EOS) which also
incorporates information about the fluctuation field. A more practical version
of this - minimally extended Orr-Sommerfeld analysis (mEOS) - is identified and
tested on a number of statistically-steady and therefore statistically stable
turbulent channel flows. Beyond the concept of statistical stability, this
extended stability analysis should also improve the popular approach of
mean-flow linear analysis in time-dependent shear flows by including more
information about the underlying flow in its predictions as well as for other
flows with additional physics such as convection.

due to the non-linearity term that characterizes it. After the linearization

by a set of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). The two main parts we
develop through this paper are focused firstly on constructing an efficient
algorithm based on a projection technique onto an extended block Krylov
subspace, that appropriately allows us to construct a reduced system of the
original DAE system. Secondly, we solve a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
problem based on a Riccati feedback approach. This approach uses numerical
solutions of large-scale algebraic Riccati equations. To this end, we use the
extended Krylov subspace method that allows us to project the initial large
matrix problem onto a low order one that is solved by some direct methods.
These numerical solutions are used to obtain a feedback matrix that will be
used to stabilize the original system. We conclude by providing some numerical

Typically, this is done by using polynomials. Here, the use of radial basis
functions as a methods for underlying functional approximation is explored in
one dimension, using both analytical and numerical methods. At some mesh
densities, RBF flux reconstruction is found to outperform polynomial flux
reconstruction, and this range of mesh densities becomes finer as the width of
the RBF interpolator is increased. A method which avoids the poor conditioning
of flat RBFs is used to test a wide range of basis shapes, and at very small
values, the polynomial behaviour is recovered. Changing the location of the
solution points is found to have an effect similar to that in polynomial FR,
with the Gauss--Legendre points being the most effective. Altering the location

performance. Similar behaviours are determined for the non-linear Burgers'

no reason why the decoder should be left out during pre-training. Second, many
existing pre-trained models, including state-of-the-art models such as
T5-learning, simply reuse the pre-training tasks designed for natural

needed eventually for code-related tasks such as code summarization, existing
pre-training tasks require a bilingual corpus composed of source code and the
associated natural language description, which severely limits the amount of

tasks that are specifically designed to enable SPT-Code to learn knowledge of
source code, the corresponding code structure, as well as a natural language
description of the code without relying on any bilingual corpus, and eventually
exploit these three sources of information when it is applied to downstream
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPT-Code achieves state-of-the-art

High-resolution spectra of HD 29399 were acquired with the CORALIE spectrograph

diagnostics to distinguish between stellar and planetary-induced signals. To
model the host star we combined forward modelling with global and local
minimisation approaches and inversion techniques. We also studied the orbital
history of the system under the effects of both dynamical and equilibrium
tides. Results. We present the detection of a long-period giant planet.

affect the orbital evolution of the planet. Moreover, no engulfment is

exploration of classical nonequilibrium processes. Recently, quantum cellular
automata have been proposed that rely on the propagation of a one-dimensional
quantum state along a fictitious discrete time dimension via the sequential
application of quantum gates. The resulting $(1+1)$-dimensional space-time
structure makes these automata special cases of feed-forward quantum neural
networks. Here we show how asynchronism -- introduced via non-commuting gates
-- impacts on the collective nonequilibrium behavior of quantum cellular
automata. We illustrate this through a simple model, whose synchronous version
implements a contact process and features a nonequilibrium phase transition in
the directed percolation universality class. Non-commuting quantum gates lead
to an ""asynchronism transition"", i.e. a sudden qualitative change in the phase
transition behavior once a certain degree of asynchronicity is surpassed. Our
results show how quantum effects may lead to abrupt changes of non-equilibrium
dynamics, which may be relevant for understanding the role of quantum
correlations in neural networks.

imaging and electrical impedance tomography (EIT), offers both high resolution
(in comparison to EIT) and high contrast (in comparison to ultrasound imaging).
It is used to map the internal conductivity distribution of an imaging object.
However, conductivity reconstruction in MAET is a challenge, so conventional
MAET is mainly devoted to mapping the conductivity interface. This is primarily
because integration byparts is used in the theory derivation, and the
simplified measurement formula suggests the voltage is proportional to the
conductivity gradient, which leads to an error in the measurement formula. In
this study, the measurement signal is expressed as the convolution of acoustic
velocity and conductivity distribution without using integration by parts,
which retains the low-frequency term in the measurement signal. Based on the
convolution formula, we subsequently propose a direct conductivity
reconstruction scheme with deconvolution by utilizing the low-frequency
component. We verify the proposed method based on two two-dimension models and
quantify the L2 errors of reconstructed conductivity. Besides, we analyze
factors influencing the reconstructed accuracy such as reconstructed
regularization parameter ultrasound frequency, and noise. We also demonstrate
that the spatial resolution is not influenced by the duration of excitation
ultrasound. With the contributions of the proposed method, conductivity imaging
appears to be feasible for application to the early diagnosis in the future.

correct the drift of visual odometry and keep reliable positioning while GNSS

global localization is achieved in the outer-layer, where the local motion is
further fused with GNSS position and course in a long-term period in a

a promotion of 69% in initialization accuracy compared with state-of-the-art

instead of complete scenes. However, objects play a crucial role in conveying
cultural meanings and can strongly influence how an image is perceived within a

that make it an interesting and relevant case study for exploring the impact of
image culturization. Italy is a very culturally conservative society, and
Italians have specific sensitivities and expectations regarding the accurate
representation of their cultural identity and traditions, which can shape
individuals' preferences and inclinations toward certain visual styles,
aesthetics, and design choices. As a consequence, we think they are an ideal
candidate for a preliminary investigation of image culturization.

limitation could be overcome by using periodical resets of an NV spin as a
mediator of interaction between two nuclear spins [Chen, Schwarz, and Plenio,

strengths condition, which makes it not applicable to heteronuclear quantum
gate operations. Here we develop this scheme by using radio-frequency (RF)
fields to control different nuclear spin species. Periodical resets of the NV
center protect the nuclear spins from decoherence and relaxation of the NV
spin. RF control provides probability to have highly selective and high
fidelity quantum gates between heteronuclear spins as well as detecting nuclear
spins by using a nuclear spin sensor under ambient conditions.

different quantum systems in the past few years. Spin couplings and cavity
losses have been shown to play crucial roles for realizing DTC order in open
many-body systems out of equilibrium. Recently, it has been proposed that
eternal and transient DTC can be present with an open Floquet setup in the
thermodynamic limit and in the deep quantum regime with few qubits,
respectively. In this work, we consider the effects of spin damping and spin
dephasing on the DTC order in spin-optomechanical and open cavity systems in
which the spins can be all-to-all coupled. In the thermodynamic limit, it is
shown that the existence of dephasing can destroy the coherence of the system
and finally lead the system to its trivial steady state. Without dephasing,
eternal DTC is displayed in the weak damping regime, which may be destroyed by
increasing the all-to-all spin coupling or the spin damping. By contrast, the
all-to-all coupling is constructive to the DTC in the moderate damping regime.
We also focus on a model which can be experimentally realized by a suspended
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membrane with a few spin color centers under
microwave drive and Floquet magnetic field. Signatures of transient DTC
behavior are demonstrated in both weak and moderate dissipation regimes without
spin dephasing. Relevant experimental parameters are also discussed for
realizing transient DTC order in such an hBN optomechanical system.

the order of a billion years. It is shown that the secular effects of the
gravitational action of a massive disk of small bodies lead to an increase in
the eccentricities of the orbits of individual objects. The result of this
dynamical behavior is the creation of a flux of small bodies coming close to
the orbit of Neptune. The change in the number of objects surviving in the
observable region of distant trans-Neptunian objects (the region of orbits with
perihelion distances of 40 < q < 80 AU and semimajor axes 150 < a < 1000 AU),

an increase in the initial mass. On the other hand, for most objects, orbital

training practice. Less than half of the students completed the training
without displaying a solution, and only in two sessions, all students completed
all phases. Then, we simulate how students would proceed in one of the past

this simulation, we propose a novel tutor model for adaptive training, which
considers students' proficiency before and during an ongoing training session.
The proficiency is assessed using a pre-training questionnaire and various
in-training metrics. Finally, we conduct a study with 24 students and new

results show that the adaptive training does not overwhelm students as the
original static training. Adaptive training enables students to enter several
alternative training phases with lower difficulty than the original training.
The proposed format is not restricted to a particular training. Therefore, it
can be applied to practicing any security topic or even in related fields, such

one FWSM state composed of the up-spin Floquet sidebands relevant to $J_z=3/2$

in more energy-efficient machines without compromising performance. However,
machine builders do not actually use the design methods described in the
literature as these algorithms require too much theoretical analysis. Moreover,
the design synthesis approaches in the literature predominantly utilize
heuristic optimizers leading to suboptimal local minima.
  This research introduces a convenient optimization workflow allowing wide
industrial adoption, while guaranteeing to reveal the global optimum. To
guarantee that we find the global optimum, a mathematical expression of the
constraints describing the feasible region of possible designs is of great
importance. Therefore, kinematic analysis of the point-to-point (PTP) planar
four-bar mechanism is discussed to obtain the static and dynamic constraints.
Within the feasible region, objective value samples are generated through CAD
multi-body software. These motion simulations determine the required torque to
fulfill the movement for a certain combination of design parameters. Sparse
interpolation techniques allow minimizing the required amount of samples and
thus CAD simulations. Moreover, this interpolation of simulation results
enables the representation of the objective in a mathematical description
without in-depth analytical design analysis by the machine designer.
Subsequently, the mathematical expression of the objective allows global
optimizers to find a global optimal design within the feasible design space. In
a case study of a coronaventilator mechanism with three design parameters

synchronization that reveal emergent collective behavior due to the fascinating
bidirectional interplay between phase and spatial dynamics. Although different
coupling topologies have already been considered, here we introduce
time-varying competitive phase interaction among swarmalators where the
underlying connectivity for attractive and repulsive coupling varies depending
on the vision (sensing) radius. Apart from investigating some fundamental
properties like conservation of center of position and collision avoidance, we
also scrutinize the cases of extreme limits of vision radius. The concurrence
of attractive-repulsive competitive phase coupling allows the exploration of
diverse asymptotic states, like static $\pi$, and mixed phase wave states, and
we explore the feasible routes of those states through a detailed numerical
analysis. In sole presence of attractive local coupling, we reveal the
occurrence of static cluster synchronization where the number of clusters
depends crucially on the initial distribution of positions and phases of each
swarmalator. In addition, we analytically calculate the sufficient condition
for the emergence of the static synchronization state. We further report the
appearance of the static ring phase wave state and evaluate its radius
theoretically. Finally, we validate our findings using Stuart-Landau
oscillators to describe the phase dynamics of swarmalators subject to
attractive local coupling.

FedBalancer, a systematic FL framework that actively selects clients' training

utilize the sample selection to speed up global training, we further introduce
an adaptive deadline control scheme that predicts the optimal deadline for each

\textit{quadratic assignment problem} (QAP) by dropping one or more of the

probabilistic solver refines the estimated assignments in an iterative manner

Clusters (GCs) around galaxies are known to be the tracers of the merger events
that have been forming these galaxies. Therefore, identifying such systems
allows to study galaxies mass assembly, formation and evolution. However, in
the lack of spectroscopic information detecting UCDs/GCs using imaging data is
very uncertain. Here, we aim to train a machine learning model to separate
these objects from the foreground stars and background galaxies using the
multi-wavelength imaging data of the Fornax galaxy cluster in 6 filters, namely
u, g, r, i, J and Ks. The classes of objects are highly imbalanced which is
problematic for many automatic classification techniques. Hence, we employ
Synthetic Minority Over-sampling to handle the imbalance of the training data.
Then, we compare two classifiers, namely Localized Generalized Matrix Learning
Vector Quantization (LGMLVQ) and Random Forest (RF). Both methods are able to
identify UCDs/GCs with a precision and a recall of >93 percent and provide
relevances that reflect the importance of each feature dimension %(colors and
angular sizes) for the classification. Both methods detect angular sizes as
important markers for this classification problem. While it is astronomical
expectation that color indices of u-i and i-Ks are the most important colors,
our analysis shows that colors such as g-r are more informative, potentially
because of higher signal-to-noise ratio. Besides the excellent performance the
LGMLVQ method allows further interpretability by providing the feature
importance for each individual class, class-wise representative samples and the
possibility for non-linear visualization of the data as demonstrated in this
contribution. We conclude that employing machine learning techniques to
identify UCDs/GCs can lead to promising results.

by that the vision transformer (ViT) is powerful in image classification, some
semantic segmentation ViTs are recently proposed, most of them attaining
impressive results but at a cost of computational economy. In this paper, we
succeed in introducing multi-scale representations into semantic segmentation
ViT via window attention mechanism and further improves the performance and
efficiency. To this end, we introduce large window attention which allows the
local window to query a larger area of context window at only a little
computation overhead. By regulating the ratio of the context area to the query
area, we enable the large window attention to capture the contextual
information at multiple scales. Moreover, the framework of spatial pyramid
pooling is adopted to collaborate with the large window attention, which
presents a novel decoder named large window attention spatial pyramid pooling

preserve the quantum line element -- for any gauge that is stationary (in the

the very complex pinning energy landscape that goes beyond the conventional

the formalism of hyperbolic long wave models. Evolution of non-smooth initial
data is examined, and in particular the splitting of singular points and their
short time behaviour is described. In the opposite limit of longer times, the
local analysis of wavefronts is used to estimate the gradient catastrophe
formation and how this is influenced by the topography. The limiting cases when
the free surface intersects the bottom boundary, belonging to the so-called
""physical"" and ""non-physical"" vacuum classes, are examined. Solutions expressed
by power series in the spatial variable lead to a hierarchy of ordinary
differential equations for the time-dependent series coefficients, which are
shown to reveal basic differences between the two vacuum cases: for
non-physical vacuums, the equations of the hierarchy are recursive and linear
past the first two pairs, while for physical vacuums the hierarchy is
non-recursive, fully coupled and nonlinear. The former case may admit solutions
that are free of singularities for nonzero time intervals, while the latter is
shown to develop non-standard velocity shocks instantaneously. We show that
truncation to finite dimensional systems and polynomial solutions is in general
only possible for the case of a quadratic bottom profile. In this case the
system's evolution can reduce to, and is completely described by, a low
dimensional dynamical system for the time-dependent coefficients. This system
encapsulates all the nonlinear properties of the solution for general power
series initial data, and in particular governs the loss of regularity in finite
times at the dry point. For the special case of parabolic bottom topographies,
an exact, self-similar solution class is introduced and studied to illustrate
via closed form expressions the general results.

diffraction pattern strongly reduced for very large interactions due to
interaction dependent loss processes. For longer pulses diffraction shows the
characteristic for matter waves impinging on an array of tubes and coherent
channeling transport. We observe a slowing down of the time evolution governing
the population of the momentum modes caused by the strong atom interaction. A
simple physical explanation of that slowing down is the phase shift caused by
the self-interaction of the forming matter wave patterns inside the standing

applications. However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine
Learning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs
could cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks
have demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks
a significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily
on creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and
distribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of
these attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their
execution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time
adversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial
examples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new
problem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to
support such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves
our understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and
provides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we
first conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms.
Universal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead,
and can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because
of their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific
input, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation
under time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline
attack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the
online algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks
under time constraints.

sensors to lighting conditions and high-speed motion sets a limitation on the

technology with the potential to address the challenges of conventional vision
with its high temporal resolution, low latency, and wide dynamic range. In this
paper and for the first time, we propose a novel neuromorphic vision based
controller for faster and more reliable machining operations, and present a
complete robotic system capable of performing drilling tasks with
sub-millimeter accuracy. Our proposed system localizes the target workpiece in
3D using two perception stages that we developed specifically for the
asynchronous output of neuromorphic cameras. The first stage performs
multi-view reconstruction for an initial estimate of the workpiece's pose, and
the second stage refines this estimate for a local region of the workpiece
using circular hole detection. The robot then precisely positions the drilling
end-effector and drills the target holes on the workpiece using a combined
position-based and image-based visual servoing approach. The proposed solution
is validated experimentally for drilling nutplate holes on workpieces placed
arbitrarily in an unstructured environment with uncontrolled lighting.
Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our solution with an average
positional errors of less than 0.1 mm, and demonstrate that the use of
neuromorphic vision overcomes the lighting and speed limitations of
conventional cameras.

modal analysis regarding Euler-Bernoulli eigenmodes. Experiment and simulation
revealed convincing evidence for the possibility of modelling the physics of
such a micro-beam by means of lumped parameter models involving only a single
degree of freedom, the Euler-Bernoulli zero mode. In this paper we present the
corresponding analytical single degree of freedom lumped parameter model (LPM).
This comprehensive model demonstrates the impact of the beam bending on the
nature of the Coulomb singularity, allows for an easy and accurate computation
of the pull-in voltage in the presence of stress stiffening and is apt for
efficient frequency response computations. Our method to derive the zero-mode
LPM is based on a Chebyshev-Edgeworth type method as is common in analytical
probability theory. While used here for a very particular purpose, this novel

However, there are three major challenges in this area. The first major
difficulty is concept drift, that is, the probability distribution in the

catastrophic forgetting, that is, forgetting what we have learned before when
learning new knowledge. The last one we often ignore is the learning of the
latent representation. Only good latent representation can improve the
prediction accuracy of the model. Our research builds on this observation and
attempts to overcome these difficulties. To this end, we propose an Adaptive
Online Incremental Learning for evolving data streams (AOIL). We use
auto-encoder with the memory module, on the one hand, we obtained the latent
features of the input, on the other hand, according to the reconstruction loss
of the auto-encoder with memory module, we could successfully detect the
existence of concept drift and trigger the update mechanism, adjust the model
parameters in time. In addition, we divide features, which are derived from the
activation of the hidden layers, into two parts, which are used to extract the
common and private features respectively. By means of this approach, the model
could learn the private features of the new coming instances, but do not forget
what we have learned in the past (shared features), which reduces the
occurrence of catastrophic forgetting. At the same time, to get the fusion
feature vector we use the self-attention mechanism to effectively fuse the
extracted features, which further improved the latent representation learning.

cancer treatment with image guided radiation therapy. The automation of the
segmentation task is therefore of high clinical relevance. Deep Learning (DL)
based medical image segmentation is currently the most successful approach, but
suffers from the over-presence of the background class and the anatomically
given organ size difference, which is most severe in the head and neck (HAN)
area. To tackle the HAN area specific class imbalance problem we first optimize
the patch-size of the currently best performing general purpose segmentation
framework, the nnU-Net, based on the introduced class imbalance measurement,
and second, introduce the class adaptive Dice loss to further compensate for
the highly imbalanced setting. Both the patch-size and the loss function are
parameters with direct influence on the class imbalance and their optimization
leads to a 3\% increase of the Dice score and 22% reduction of the 95%
Hausdorff distance compared to the baseline, finally reaching $0.8\pm0.15$ and
$3.17\pm1.7$ mm for the segmentation of seven HAN organs using a single and
simple neural network. The patch-size optimization and the class adaptive Dice
loss are both simply integrable in current DL based segmentation approaches and
allow to increase the performance for class imbalanced segmentation tasks.

twisted bilayer graphene, and are expected to host similarly strong
electron-electron interactions near the magic angle. Here, we study alternating
twist quadrilayer graphene (ATQG) samples with twist angles of 1.96{\deg} and
1.52{\deg}, which are slightly removed from the magic angle of 1.68{\deg}. At
the larger angle, we find signatures of correlated insulators only when the
ATQG is hole doped, and no signatures of superconductivity, and for the smaller
angle we find evidence of superconductivity, while signs of the correlated
insulators weaken. Our results provide insight into the twist angle dependence
of correlated phases in ATMG and shed light on the nature of correlations in
the intermediate coupling regime at the edge of the magic angle range where
dispersion and interaction are of the same order.

Rosetta mission to comet 67P, the Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote
Imaging System on board the spacecraft took numerous image sequences of the
near-nucleus coma, with many showing the motion of individual pieces of debris
ejected from active surface areas into space.
  Aims. We aim to track the motion of individual particles in these image
sequences and derive their projected velocities and accelerations. This should
help us to constrain their point of origin on the surface, understand the
forces that influence their dynamics in the inner coma, and predict whether
they will fall back to the surface or escape to interplanetary space.
  Methods. We have developed an algorithm that tracks the motion of particles
appearing as point sources in image sequences. Our algorithm employs a point
source detection software to locate the particles and then exploits the image
sequences' pair-nature to reconstruct the particle tracks and derive the
projected velocities and accelerations. We also constrained the particle size
from their brightness.
  Results. Our algorithm identified 2268 tracks in a sample image sequence.
Manual inspection not only found that 1187 (~52%) of them are likely genuine,
but in combination with runs on simulated data it also revealed a simple
criterion related to the completeness of a track to single out a large subset
of the genuine tracks without the need for manual intervention. A tentative
analysis of a small (n = 89) group of particles exemplifies how our data can be
used, and provides first results on the particles' velocity, acceleration, and
radius distributions, which agree with previous work.

of reactions $Y\to Y'$, each converting a multiset of educts $Y\subseteq X$
into a multiset $Y'\subseteq X$ of products. RNs are equivalent to directed
hypergraphs. However, not all RNs necessarily admit a chemical interpretation.
Instead, they might contradict fundamental principles of physics such as the
conservation of energy and mass or the reversibility of chemical reactions. The
consequences of these necessary conditions for the stoichiometric matrix
$\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{X\times\mathscr{R}}$ have been discussed
extensively in the literature. Here, we provide sufficient conditions for
$\mathbf{S}$ that guarantee the interpretation of RNs in terms of balanced sum
formulas and structural formulas, respectively.
  Chemically plausible RNs allow neither a perpetuum mobile, i.e., a ""futile
cycle"" of reactions with non-vanishing energy production, nor the creation or
annihilation of mass. Such RNs are said to be thermodynamically sound and
conservative. For finite RNs, both conditions can be expressed equivalently as
properties of $\mathbf{S}$. The first condition is vacuous for reversible
networks, but it excludes irreversible futile cycles and - in a stricter sense
- futile cycles that even contain an irreversible reaction. The second
condition is equivalent to the existence of a strictly positive reaction
invariant. Furthermore, it is sufficient for the existence of a realization in
terms of sum formulas, obeying conservation of ""atoms"". In particular, these
realizations can be chosen such that any two species have distinct sum
formulas, unless $\mathbf{S}$ implies that they are ""obligatory isomers"". In
terms of structural formulas, every compound is a labeled multigraph, in
essence a Lewis formula, and reactions comprise only a rearrangement of bonds
such that the total bond order is preserved.

toolchain automatically generates executable tests corresponding to the
discovered attack trace, which is validated across major browsers. We showcase
the effectiveness of WebSpec by discovering two new logical flaws caused by the
interaction of different browser mechanisms and by identifying three previously
discovered logical flaws in the current Web platform, as well as five in old

a recursive average of surrogate functions of an objective function. The
surrogates are required to be strongly convex and convergence rate analysis for
the general non-convex setting was not available. In this paper, we propose an
extension of SMM where surrogates are allowed to be only weakly convex or block
multi-convex, and the averaged surrogates are approximately minimized with
proximal regularization or block-minimized within diminishing radii,
respectively. For the general nonconvex constrained setting with non-i.i.d.

empirical loss and $O((\log n)^{1+\epsilon}/n^{1/4})$ for the expected loss,
where $n$ denotes the number of data samples processed. Under some additional

more intense shock reformation, the Kelvin-Helmholtz rippling effects on the

thinner than those predicted by the hybrid simulation. The greatest effect of
the electron physics, comes from the processes of particle energization. Both

functions and time-averaged non-linear effective bond potentials for the OH
stretch and HOH bend vibrations are extracted. The obtained friction exhibits
adiabatic contributions at and below the vibrational time scales, but also much
slower non-adiabatic contributions, reflecting homogeneous and inhomogeneous
line broadening mechanisms, respectively. Compared to the gas phase, hydration
softens both stretch and bend potentials, which by itself would lead to a
red-shift of the corresponding vibrational bands. In contrast, non-adiabatic
friction contributions cause a spectral blue shift. For the stretch mode, the
potential effect dominates and thus a significant red shift when going from gas
to the liquid phase results. For the bend mode, potential and non-adiabatic
friction effects are of comparable magnitude, so that a slight blue shift
results, in agreement with well-known but puzzling experimental findings. The
observed line broadening is shown to be roughly equally caused by adiabatic and
non-adiabatic friction contributions for both, the stretch and bend modes in
liquid water. Thus, the understanding of infrared vibrational frequencies and
line shapes is considerably advanced by the quantitative analysis of the
time-dependent friction that acts on vibrational modes in liquids.

interlayer Josephson coupling will induce SC with pairing angular momentum
$L=l$ or $L=n-l$ in the LA-THB, determined by microscopic details. The latter
one is just the HAM TSC if $l>0$. Based on our revised perturbational-band

contains a target $\calU$ whose boundary $\partial \calU$ is a chemically
reactive surface. Such a target could represent a single reactive molecule, an
intracellular compartment or a whole cell. Recently, a probabilistic framework
for studying diffusion-mediated surface reactions has been developed that
considers the joint probability density or propagator for the particle position
and the so-called boundary local time. The latter characterizes the amount of
time that a Brownian particle spends in the neighborhood of a point on a
totally reflecting boundary. The effects of surface reactions are then
incorporated via an appropriate stopping condition for the boundary local time.
In this paper we generalize the theory of diffusion-mediated surface reactions
to cases where the whole interior target domain $\calU$ acts as a partial
absorber rather than the target boundary $\partial \calU$. Now the particle can
freely enter and exit $\calU$, and is only able to react (be absorbed) within
$\calU$. The appropriate Brownian functional is then the occupation time
(accumulated time that the particle spends within $\calU$) rather than the
boundary local time. We show that both cases can be considered within a unified
framework by using a Feynman-Kac formula to derive a boundary value problem
(BVP) for the propagator of the corresponding Brownian functional, and
introducing an associated stopping condition. We illustrate the theory by
calculating the mean first passage time (MFPT) for a spherical target $\calU$
located at the center of a spherical domain $\Omega$. This is achieved by
solving the propagator BVP directly, rather than using spectral methods. We
find that if the first moment of the stopping time density is infinite, then
the MFPT is also infinite, that is, the spherical target is not sufficiently
absorbing.

combat this problem, we present a new self-supervised learning pretext task for
beat tracking and downbeat estimation. This task makes use of Spleeter, an
audio source separation model, to separate a song's drums from the rest of its
signal. The first set of signals are used as positives, and by extension
negatives, for contrastive learning pre-training. The drum-less signals, on the
other hand, are used as anchors. When pre-training a fully-convolutional and
recurrent model using this pretext task, an onset function is learned. In some
cases, this function was found to be mapped to periodic elements in a song. We
found that pre-trained models outperformed randomly initialized models when a
beat tracking training set was extremely small (less than 10 examples). When
that was not the case, pre-training led to a learning speed-up that caused the
model to overfit to the training set. More generally, this work defines new
perspectives in the realm of musical self-supervised learning. It is notably
one of the first works to use audio source separation as a fundamental
component of self-supervision.

much research attention in recent years, which are usually embedded into
learning frameworks as components. However, previous algorithms, with or
without learning strategies, usually suffer from the degradation of the
optimality with the increment of the problem size. In this paper, we propose a
learnable linear assignment solver based on deep graph networks. Specifically,
we first transform the cost matrix to a bipartite graph and convert the
assignment task to the problem of selecting reliable edges from the constructed
graph. Subsequently, a deep graph network is developed to aggregate and update
the features of nodes and edges. Finally, the network predicts a label for each
edge that indicates the assignment relationship. The experimental results on a
synthetic dataset reveal that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
and achieves consistently high accuracy with the increment of the problem size.
Furthermore, we also embed the proposed solver, in comparison with
state-of-the-art baseline solvers, into a popular multi-object tracking (MOT)
framework to train the tracker in an end-to-end manner. The experimental
results on MOT benchmarks illustrate that the proposed LAP solver improves the
tracker by the largest margin.

intervention is still needed in the loop anyway to deal with unseen situations
or compensate for inaccurate or improper vehicle's decisions. For such cases,
video feed, in addition to other data such as LIDAR, is considered essential to
provide humans with the real picture of what is hap-pening to eventually take
the right decision. However, if the video is not delivered in a timely
fashion,it becomes useless or likely produce catastrophic outcomes.
Additionally, any disruption in the streamed video, for instance during
handover operation while traversing inter-countries cross borders, is very
annoying to the user and possibly ause damages as well. In this article, we
start by describing two important use cases, namely Remote Driving and
Platooning, where the timely delivery of video is of extreme importance [1].
Thereafter, we detail our implemented solution to accommodate the
aforementioned use cases for self-driving vehicles. Through extensive
experiments in local and LTE networks, we show that our solution ensures a very
low end-to-end latency. Also, we show that our solution keeps the video outage
as low as possible during handover operation.

Communication (MTC) has become an important use case of the Fifth Generation
(5G) communication systems. Since MTC devices are mostly disconnected from Base
Station (BS) for power saving, random access procedure is required for devices
to transmit data. If many devices try random access simultaneously, preamble
collision problem occurs, thus causing latency increase. In an environment
where delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant devices coexist, the contention-based
random access procedure cannot satisfy latency requirements of delay-sensitive
devices. Therefore, we propose RAPID, a novel random access procedure, which is
completed through two message exchanges for the delay-sensitive devices. We
also develop Access Pattern Analyzer (APA), which estimates traffic
characteristics of MTC devices. When UEs, performing RAPID and contention-based
random access, coexist, it is important to determine a value which is the
number of preambles for RAPID to reduce random access load. Thus, we analyze
random access load using a Markov chain model to obtain the optimal number of
preambles for RAPID. Simulation results show RAPID achieves 99.999% reliability
with 80.8% shorter uplink latency, and also decreases random access load by
30.5% compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

the amplitude or phase of the radio signal via reflecting elements to
reconfigure the radio propagation environment and enhance the transmission rate
of the ISAC system. By jointly designing the radar signal covariance (RSC)
matrix, the beamforming vector of the communication system, and the IRS phase
shift, the ISAC system transmission rate can be improved while matching the
desired waveform for radar. The problem is non-convex due to multivariate

closed-form solution of the RSC matrix is derived from the desired radar
waveform. Next, the quadratic transformation (QT) technique is applied to the
subproblem, and then alternating optimization (AO) is employed to determine the
communication beamforming vector and the IRS phase shift. For computing the IRS
phase shift, we adopt both the majorization minimization (MM) and the manifold
