contextuality [1] that appeared recently. In particular we will introduce and
discuss the ideas of extracontextuality and extravalence, that allow one to
relate Kochen-Specker's and Gleason's theorems, and also to shift the emphasis
from the first to the second one. We will also argue that whereas
Kochen-Specker's is essentially a negative result (a no-go theorem), Gleason's
is a positive one since it provides a mathematical justification of Born's
rule. The link between these issues is provided by a specific quantum feature
that we call extravalence.

using a percolation process and find that anisotropy has a negative impact on a

of polydisperse spheres with a radius of 0.8 nm, in a shear-induced
multilamellar vesicle (MLV) state using a 40 wt.% polyethylene glycol dodecyl

the equilibrium state of the non-ionic planar lamellar phase, the Fh
dispersion, and their mixture. The MLV state was induced by using a shear flow
in a Taylor-Couette geometry of a rheometer. Findings The nonionic surfactant
initially exhibited a lamellar gel phase with two distinct d-spacings of 11.0

nanoparticles induced bilayer attraction by suppressing lamellar layer
undulations, decreasing the d-spacing. These results are helpful in the

and mitigating the effects of pollution. Recent advances in the field of graph
signal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution
monitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the
reconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors.
Reconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help
improve the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with
correlated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring
sensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of
graph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air
pollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian
interpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal
reconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared
on actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of
the methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the
computational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority
of methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the
difficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network

be overcome with simple methods, such as partitioning the network using a

rate of stable vehicles above which the system is stable, and under which the

enough cars are on the road. The critical penetration rate is explicitly
computable, and, in reasonable situations, a small minority of aggressive

source of instability that a single population model would not be able to

emerges as the number of cars increases, even if the traffic density remains

that small experiments could lead to deducing imprecise stability conditions.

is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the ""rare events"" that appear
in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the
underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by
computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD
then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per
dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each
data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our
contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method
called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform
extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD
outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed

characterization of these crossover phenomena driven by defects is achieved by
analyzing the ground-state fidelity associated with small changes of the defect

kernels across the entire input image. This is sub-optimal for natural images,
as they often consist of heterogeneous visual patterns. Dynamic convolution
tries to address this issue by using per-pixel convolution kernels, but this
greatly increases computational cost. In this work, we present Malleable
Convolution (MalleConv), which performs spatial-varying processing with minimal
computational overhead. MalleConv uses a smaller set of spatially-varying
convolution kernels, a compromise between static and per-pixel convolution
kernels. These spatially-varying kernels are produced by an efficient predictor
network running on a downsampled input, making them much more efficient to
compute than per-pixel kernels produced by a full-resolution image, and also
enlarging the network's receptive field compared with static kernels. These
kernels are then jointly upsampled and applied to a full-resolution feature map
through an efficient on-the-fly slicing operator with minimum memory overhead.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of MalleConv, we use it to build an efficient
denoising network we call MalleNet. MalleNet achieves high-quality results
without very deep architectures, making it 8.9x faster than the best performing
denoising algorithms while achieving similar visual quality. We also show that
a single MalleConv layer added to a standard convolution-based backbone can
significantly reduce the computational cost or boost image quality at a similar
cost. More information is on our project page:

Standard, middleware-based data recording does not provide sufficient
information on internal computation and performance bottlenecks. Other existing
methods also target very specific problems and thus cannot be used for
multipurpose analysis. Moreover, they are not suitable for real-time
applications. In this paper, we present ros2_tracing, a collection of flexible
tracing tools and multipurpose instrumentation for ROS 2. It allows collecting
runtime execution information on real-time distributed systems, using the
low-overhead LTTng tracer. Tools also integrate tracing into the invaluable ROS
2 orchestration system and other usability tools. A message latency experiment
shows that the end-to-end message latency overhead, when enabling all ROS 2
instrumentation, is on average 0.0033 ms, which we believe is suitable for
production real-time systems. ROS 2 execution information obtained using
ros2_tracing can be combined with trace data from the operating system,
enabling a wider range of precise analyses, that help understand an application
execution, to find the cause of performance bottlenecks and other issues. The

integrable and generic systems, but its decay seems to differ in these two
cases. We observe that the spreading of the operator weight front in QHCG is
markedly different from chaotic, generic integrable and free systems, as the
front freezes in the long time limit. Finally, we discuss the OSEE in QHCG and
show that it grows at most logarithmically with time in accordance with the
conjectured behaviour for interacting integrable systems.

alternative for limited fossil fuels. The effectiveness of the conversion from
solar energy to hydrogen fuel relies primarily on the material. Previously,
researchers studied different TMDs such as WS$_{2}$, and PdSe$_{2}$. These
materials perform well in certain aspects such as strong adsorption stability
and promising abilities for HER, however, their band gaps are still not ideal.
In this paper, we studied a new TMD material WSe$_{2}$, which is currently used
in heterostructure photocatalysts. To our knowledge, this is the first
assessment of using transition metal doped WSe$_{2}$ as potential
photocatalysts for photocatalytic water splitting. Using first principles
calculations, we evaluated the band gaps and other photocatalytic abilities of
pristine WSe2 as well as Cr, Mo, Ta, and Re doped WSe$_{2}$. Compared to
previously studied TMD materials, three of our newly studied materials
(pristine, Mo doped, and Ta doped WSe$_{2}$)demonstrated more desirable band
gaps, which are closer to being ideal (1.23eV); The band edge positions of our
materials are also closer to the ideal reduction potential of H$^{+}$/H$_{2}$
and the oxidation potential of O$_{2}$/H$_{2}$O. Furthermore, Mo and Ta doped
WSe$_{2}$ monolayers undergo an exothermic process, indicating stable
monolayers. Of the three selected materials, pristine WSe$_{2}$ exhibits the
strongest water adsorption abilities. Our results substantiates pristine, Mo
doped, and Cr doped WSe$_{2}$ as potential photocatalysts for water splitting.

enhance the transmission of various infectious diseases, as the wake spreads
virus-laden droplets across the room. Thus, this study analyses the interaction
between vortical wake structures and exhaled multi-component saliva droplets. A
self-propelling analytically-described dipolar vortex is chosen as a model wake
flow, passing through a cloud of micron-sized evaporating saliva droplets. The
droplets' spatial location, velocity, diameter, and temperature are traced and
coupled to their local flow field. For the first time, the wake structure decay
is incorporated and analyzed, which is proved essential for accurately
predicting the settling distances of the dispersed droplets. The model also
considers the non-volatile saliva components, adequately capturing the essence
of droplet-aerosol transition and predicting the equilibrium diameter of the
residual aerosols. Our analytic model reveals non-intuitive interactions
between wake flows, droplet relaxation time, gravity, and transport phenomena.
We reveal that given the right conditions, a virus-laden saliva droplet might
translate to distances two orders of magnitude larger than the carrier-flow
characteristic size. Moreover, accounting for the non-volatile contents inside
the droplet may lead to fundamentally different dispersion and settling
behavior compared to non-evaporating particles or pure water droplets. Ergo, we
suggest that the implementation of more complex evaporation models might be
critical in high-fidelity simulations aspiring to assess the spread of airborne
respiratory droplets.

embodied AI where artificial agents, mirroring biological counterparts, are now
able to learn from interaction to accomplish complex tasks. Despite this
success, biological organisms still hold one large advantage over these
simulated agents: adaptation. While both living and simulated agents make
decisions to achieve goals (strategy), biological organisms have evolved to
understand their environment (sensing) and respond to it (physiology). The net
gain of these factors depends on the environment, and organisms have adapted
accordingly. For example, in a low vision aquatic environment some fish have
evolved specific neurons which offer a predictable, but incredibly rapid,
strategy to escape from predators. Mammals have lost these reactive systems,
but they have a much larger fields of view and brain circuitry capable of
understanding many future possibilities. While traditional embodied agents
manipulate an environment to best achieve a goal, we argue for an introspective
agent, which considers its own abilities in the context of its environment. We
show that different environments yield vastly different optimal designs, and
increasing long-term planning is often far less beneficial than other
improvements, such as increased physical ability. We present these findings to
broaden the definition of improvement in embodied AI passed increasingly

parameterizations which are a major source of uncertainties in simulations of
climate. In recent years, it has been suggested that machine-learning (ML)
parameterizations based on high-resolution model output data could be superior
to traditional parameterizations. Currently, both traditional and ML
parameterizations of subgrid processes in the atmosphere are based on a
single-column approach, which only use information from single atmospheric
columns. However, single-column parameterizations might not be ideal since
certain atmospheric phenomena, such as organized convective systems, can cross
multiple grid boxes and involve slantwise circulations that are not purely
vertical. Here we train neural networks (NNs) using non-local inputs spanning
over 3$\times$3 columns of inputs. We find that including the non-local inputs
improves the offline prediction of a range of subgrid processes. The
improvement is especially notable for subgrid momentum transport and for
atmospheric conditions associated with mid-latitude fronts and convective
instability. Using an interpretability method, we find that the NN improvements
partly rely on using the horizontal wind divergence, and we further show that
including the divergence or vertical velocity as a separate input substantially
improves offline performance. However, non-local winds continue to be useful
inputs for parameterizating subgrid momentum transport even when the vertical
velocity is included as an input. Overall, our results imply that the use of
non-local variables and the vertical velocity as inputs could improve the

GPS spoofing attacks targeting drones, based on the video stream captured by a

their location (GPS); by calculating the correlation between each frame, our
method can identify an attack on a drone. We first analyze the performance of
the suggested method in a controlled environment by conducting experiments on a
flight simulator that we developed. Then, we analyze its performance in the
real world using a DJI drone. Our method can provide different levels of
security against GPS spoofing attacks, depending on the detection interval
required; for example, it can provide a high level of security to a drone
flying at an altitude of 50-100 meters over an urban area at an average speed
of 4 km/h in conditions of low ambient light; in this scenario, the method can
provide a level of security that detects any GPS spoofing attack in which the
spoofed location is a distance of 1-4 meters (an average of 2.5 meters) from
the real location.

heavily dependent on model-based planning approaches. However, model-based

tends to generate less effective sampling locations and lead to high
reconstruction error. In the present paper, a data-driven approach is developed
to overcome the drawbacks of the model-based approach and improve the
spatiotemporal field reconstruction accuracy. The proposed method can select
the most informative sampling locations to represent the entire spatiotemporal
field. To this end, the proposed method decomposes the spatiotemporal field
using principal component analysis (PCA) and finds the top r essential entities
of the principal basis. The corresponding sampling locations of the selected
entities are regarded as the sensor deployment locations. The observations
collected at the selected sensor deployment locations can then be used to
reconstruct the spatiotemporal field, accurately. Results are demonstrated
using a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sea surface temperature

As witnessed in recent literature, these deep networks are capable of
overfitting their training distributions, causing inaccurate hallucinations to

control and interpretability over a deep denoiser, we propose a novel framework
exploiting a denoising network. We call it controllable confidence-based image
denoising (CCID). In this framework, we exploit the outputs of a deep denoising
network alongside an image convolved with a reliable filter. Such a filter can
be a simple convolution kernel which does not risk adding hallucinated
information. We propose to fuse the two components with a frequency-domain
approach that takes into account the reliability of the deep network outputs.
With our framework, the user can control the fusion of the two components in
the frequency domain. We also provide a user-friendly map estimating spatially
the confidence in the output that potentially contains network hallucination.
Results show that our CCID not only provides more interpretability and control,
but can even outperform both the quantitative performance of the deep denoiser
and that of the reliable filter, especially when the test data diverge from the
training data.

Dirac operator that preserves the exact chiral symmetry. We have found that the

since the 1990s. Research investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles
significantly alter the suspension's thermal properties. The thermal
conductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found to
be greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity
is found to depend on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed
to model the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, but there is no reliable
universal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids.
In recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed
to create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially
for modeling difficult-to-understand phenomena. These supervised learning
methods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena. In this work,
we have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently
with available experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for
predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks
are trained using the transfer learning approach to predict the thermal
conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32
different particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The
large amount of lower accuracy data generated from correlations is used to
coarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount of more trustworthy
experimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer
learning-based models' results are compared with those from baseline models
which are trained only on experimental data using a goodness of fit metric. It
is found that the transfer learning models perform better with goodness of fit

backgrounds are planar and spherical black holes as well as solitons of
$SU\left( 2\right) \times SU\left( 2\right) $ $\mathcal{N}=4$ gauged
supergravity in four dimensions. On these geometries, we compute the spectrum
of (quasi-)normal modes for the non-minimally coupled scalar field. We find
that the equation for the radial dependence can be integrated in terms of
hypergeometric functions leading to an exact expression for the frequencies.
The solutions do not asymptote to a constant curvature spacetime, nevertheless
the asymptotic region acquires an extra conformal Killing vector. For the black
hole, the scalar probe is purely ingoing at the horizon, and requiring that the
solutions lead to an extremum of the action principle we impose a Dirichlet
boundary condition at infinity. Surprisingly, the quasinormal modes do not
depend on the radius of the black hole, therefore this family of geometries can
be interpreted as isospectral in what regards to the wave operator
non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar. We find both purely damped modes, as
well as exponentially growing unstable modes depending on the values of the
non-minimal coupling parameter. For the solitons we show that the same
integrability property is achieved separately in a non-supersymmetric solutions
as well as for the supersymmetric one. Imposing regularity at the origin and a
well defined extremum for the action principle we obtain the spectra that can
also lead to purely oscillatory modes as well as to unstable scalar probes,

strategy consists of integrating color information into local textural patterns
to characterize a color micro-texture. Most models in the literature that use
the color and texture features treat them separately. In our case, it is the
simple, yet powerful LTP (Local Ternary Patterns) texture descriptor applied to
opposing color pairs of a color space that allows us to achieve this end. Each
color micro-texture is represented by vector whose components are from a
superpixel obtained by SLICO (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering with zero

micro-texture is computed by the FastMap method, a fast version of MDS
(Multi-dimensional Scaling), that considers the color micro-textures
non-linearity while preserving their distances. These degrees of dissimilarity
give us an intermediate saliency map for each RGB, HSL, LUV and CMY color

  temporal boundary mirror",,,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A temporal boundary refers to a specific time at which the properties of an
optical medium are abruptly changed. When light interacts with the temporal
boundary, its spectral content can be redistributed due to the breaking of
continuous time-translational symmetry of the medium where light resides. In
this work, we use this principle to demonstrate, at terahertz (THz)
frequencies, the resonance-enhanced spectral funneling of light coupled to a
Fabry-Perot resonator with a temporal boundary mirror. To produce a temporal
boundary effect, we abruptly increase the reflectance of a mirror constituting
the Fabry-Perot resonator and, correspondingly, its quality factor in a
step-like manner. The abrupt increase in the mirror reflectance leads to a
trimming of the coupled THz pulse that causes the pulse to broaden in the
spectral domain. Through this dynamic resonant process, the spectral contents
of the input THz pulse are redistributed into the modal frequencies of the
high-Q Fabry-Perot resonator formed after the temporal boundary. An energy
conversion efficiency of up to 33% was recorded for funneling into the
fundamental mode with a Fabry-Perot resonator exhibiting a sudden Q-factor
change from 4.8 to 48. We anticipate that the proposed resonance-enhanced
spectral funneling technique could be further utilized in the development of
efficient mechanically tunable narrowband terahertz sources for diverse
applications.

instabilities of dense consolidating bacterial suspensions have not been
explored heretofore. Here, we report the formation of two different crack
patterns of drying suspensions of \textit{Escherichia coli} (\textit{E. coli})
with distinct motile behaviors. Circular cracks are observed for wild-type
\textit{E. coli} with active swimming, whereas spiral-like cracks form for
immotile bacteria. Using the elastic fracture mechanics and the poroelastic
theory, we show that the formation of the circular cracks is determined by the
tensile nature of the radial drying stress once the cracks are initiated by the
local order structure of bacteria due to their collective swimming. Our study
demonstrates the link between the microscopic swimming behaviors of individual
bacteria and the mechanical instabilities and macroscopic pattern formation of
drying bacterial films. The results shed light on the dynamics of active matter
in a drying process and provide useful information for understanding various
biological processes associated with drying bacterial suspensions.

become necessary to efficiently select a subset of physical qubits to use in a
quantum computation. For any given quantum program and device there are many
ways to assign physical qubits for execution of the program, and assignments
will differ in performance due to the variability in quality across qubits and
entangling operations on a single device. Evaluating the performance of each
assignment using fidelity estimation introduces significant experimental
overhead and will be infeasible for many applications, while relying on
standard device benchmarks provides incomplete information about the
performance of any specific program. Furthermore, the number of possible
assignments grows combinatorially in the number of qubits on the device and in
the program, motivating the use of heuristic optimization techniques. We
approach this problem using simulated annealing with a cost function based on
the Loschmidt Echo, a diagnostic that measures the reversibility of a quantum
process. We provide theoretical justification for this choice of cost function
by demonstrating that the optimal qubit assignment coincides with the optimal
qubit assignment based on state fidelity in the weak error limit, and we
provide experimental justification using diagnostics performed on Google's
superconducting qubit devices. We then establish the performance of simulated

which influences the model generalization and leads to undesirable performance.
To tackle this issue, we propose a memory-augmented network, called

the stored memories, resulting in better generalization. At last, the

solve this task by learning frame-level video features and align them with the

extract detailed object features in each frame to differentiate the
fine-grained appearance similarities. However, the object-level features
extracted by Faster R-CNN suffer from missing motion analysis since the object
detection model lacks temporal modeling. To solve this issue, we propose a
novel Motion-Appearance Reasoning Network (MARN), which incorporates both
motion-aware and appearance-aware object features to better reason object
relations for modeling the activity among successive frames. Specifically, we
first introduce two individual video encoders to embed the video into
corresponding motion-oriented and appearance-aspect object representations.
Then, we develop separate motion and appearance branches to learn motion-guided
and appearance-guided object relations, respectively. At last, both motion and
appearance information from two branches are associated to generate more
representative features for final grounding. Extensive experiments on two

with experiment as the two-body branching fractions are either unavailable or
subject to large finite-width effects of the scalar meson. (iii) We consider
the two-quark (scheme I) and four-quark (scheme II) descriptions of the light
scalar mesons, and find the latter generally in better agreement with
experiment. This is in line with recent BESIII measurements of semileptonic
charm decays that prefer the tetraquark description of light scalars produced
in charmed meson decays. (iv) The topological amplitude approach fails here as
the $D\to SP$ decay branching fractions cannot be reliably inferred from the
measurements of three-body decays, mainly because the decay rates cannot be
factorized into the topological amplitude squared and the phase space factor.
(v) The predicted rates for $D^0\to f_0 P, a_0 P$ are generally smaller than
experimental data by one order of magnitude, presumably implying the
significance of $W$-exchange amplitudes. (vi) The $W$-annihilation amplitude is
found to be very sizable in the $SP$ sector with $|A/T|_{SP}\sim 1/2$, contrary
to its suppression in the $PP$ sector with $|A/T|_{PP}\sim 0.18$.

diagnosis and treatment to obtain clinically useful information of shapes and
volumes of target organs and tissues. In the past several years, convolutional
neural network (CNN) based methods (e.g., U-Net) have dominated this area, but
still suffered from inadequate long-range information capturing. Hence, recent
work presented computer vision Transformer variants for medical image
segmentation tasks and obtained promising performances. Such Transformers model
long-range dependency by computing pair-wise patch relations. However, they
incur prohibitive computational costs, especially on 3D medical images (e.g.,
CT and MRI). In this paper, we propose a new method called Dilated Transformer,
which conducts self-attention for pair-wise patch relations captured
alternately in local and global scopes. Inspired by dilated convolution
kernels, we conduct the global self-attention in a dilated manner, enlarging
receptive fields without increasing the patches involved and thus reducing
computational costs. Based on this design of Dilated Transformer, we construct
a U-shaped encoder-decoder hierarchical architecture called D-Former for 3D
medical image segmentation. Experiments on the Synapse and ACDC datasets show
that our D-Former model, trained from scratch, outperforms various competitive
CNN-based or Transformer-based segmentation models at a low computational cost
without time-consuming per-training process.

high-mass star formation. Its YSO populations are thoroughly characterized. The
region is therefore a prime target for the study of star formation.
  Here, we verify the performance of the SuperCAM 64 pixel heterodyne array on
APEX. We give a descriptive overview of a set of wide-field CO(3-2) spectral
cubes obtained towards the Orion GMC complex, aimed at characterizing the
dynamics and structure of the extended molecular gas in diverse regions of the
clouds, ranging from very active sites of clustered star formation in Orion B
to comparatively quiet regions in southern Orion A.
  We present a 2.7 square degree (130pc$^2$) mapping survey in the CO(3-2)
transition, obtained using SuperCAM on APEX at an angular resolution of 19''
(7600AU or 0.037pc at a distance of 400pc), covering L1622, NGC2071, NGC2068,
OriB9, NGC2024, and NGC2023 in Orion B, and the southern part of the L1641
cloud in Orion A.
  We describe CO integrated emission and line moment maps and position-velocity
diagrams and discuss a few sub-regions in some detail. Evidence for expanding
bubbles is seen with lines splitting into double components, most prominently
in NGC2024, where we argue that the bulk of the molecular gas is in the
foreground of the HII region. High CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratios reveal warm CO
along the western edge of Orion B in the NGC2023/NGC2024 region facing the
IC434 HII region. Multiple, well separated radial velocity components seen in
L1641-S suggest that it consists of a sequence of clouds at increasingly larger
distances. We find a small, spherical cloud - the 'Cow Nebula' globule - north
of NGC2071. We trace high velocity line wings for the NGC2071-IR outflow and
the NGC2024 CO jet. The protostellar dust core FIR4 (rather than FIR5) is the

unseen anomalies by only training on the normal data. Although previous
reconstruction-based methods have made fruitful progress, their generalization
ability is limited due to two critical challenges. First, the training dataset
only contains normal patterns, which limits the model generalization ability.
Second, the feature representations learned by existing models often lack
representativeness which hampers the ability to preserve the diversity of
normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive
Memory Network with Self-supervised Learning (AMSL) to address these challenges
and enhance the generalization ability in unsupervised anomaly detection. Based
on the convolutional autoencoder structure, AMSL incorporates a self-supervised
learning module to learn general normal patterns and an adaptive memory fusion
module to learn rich feature representations. Experiments on four public
multivariate time series datasets demonstrate that AMSL significantly improves
the performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on
the largest CAP sleep stage detection dataset with 900 million samples, AMSL
outperforms the second-best baseline by \textbf{4}\%+ in both accuracy and F1

have been many developments in the area of object tracking in recent years,
tracking a small moving object amid other moving objects and actors (such as a
ball amid moving players in sports footage) continues to be a difficult task.
Existing spatio-temporal networks, such as convolutional Gated Recurrent Units
(convGRUs), are difficult to train and have trouble accurately tracking small
objects under such conditions. To overcome these difficulties, we developed the
maskGRU framework that uses a weighted sum of the internal hidden state
produced by a convGRU and a 3-channel mask of the tracked object's predicted
bounding box as the hidden state to be used at the next time step of the
underlying convGRU. We believe the technique of incorporating a mask into the
hidden state through a weighted sum has two benefits: controlling the effect of
exploding gradients and introducing an attention-like mechanism into the
network by indicating where in the previous video frame the object is located.
Our experiments show that maskGRU outperforms convGRU at tracking objects that
are small relative to the video resolution even in the presence of other moving
objects.

semi-supervised (SS) causal inference for treatment effects. Specifically, we
consider two such estimands: (a) the average treatment effect and (b) the
quantile treatment effect, as prototype cases, in an SS setting, characterized
by two available data sets: (i) a labeled data set of size $n$, providing
observations for a response and a set of high dimensional covariates, as well
as a binary treatment indicator; and (ii) an unlabeled data set of size $N$,
much larger than $n$, but without the response observed. Using these two data
sets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more
robust and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the
labeled data set only. Beyond the 'standard' double robustness results (in
terms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised methods as well, we
further establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS
estimators whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified,
without requiring specific forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an
improvement of robustness arises from the use of the massive unlabeled data, so
it is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting. In addition, our
estimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the
nuisance functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the
nuisance estimators, we consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel
smoothing estimators involving unknown covariate transformation mechanisms, and
establish in high dimensional scenarios novel results on their uniform
convergence rates, which should be of independent interest. Numerical results
on both simulated and real data validate the advantage of our methods over
their supervised counterparts with respect to both robustness and efficiency.

learning-based methods have achieved better performance than the preceding
model-based ones, they still have drawbacks: reinforcement learning depends on
the handcrafted reward that is unlikely to effectively quantify broad social

that the rate-of-change is not constant. A fundamental goal of modeling such
nonlinear processes is to estimate model parameters that reflect meaningful
aspects of change, including the parameters related to change and other
parameters that shed light on substantive hypotheses. However, if the
measurement occasion is unstructured, existing models cannot simultaneously
estimate these two types of parameters. This article has three goals. First, we
view the change over time as the area under the curve (AUC) of the
rate-of-change versus time (r-t) graph. Second, using the instantaneous
rate-of-change midway through a time interval to approximate the average
rate-of-change during that interval, we propose a new specification to describe
longitudinal processes. In addition to obtaining the individual change-related
parameters and other parameters related to specific research questions, the new
specification allows for unequally-space study waves and individual measurement
occasions around each wave. Third, we derive the model-based interval-specific
change and change-from-baseline, two common measures to evaluate change over

real-world data analysis. We also provide OpenMx and Mplus 8 code for each

choosing in CAM-based methods. Therefore, we propose Clustering and Filter of
Tokens (CaFT) with Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone to solve this problem in
another way. CaFT first sends the patch tokens of the image split to ViT and
cluster the output tokens to generate initial mask of the object. Secondly,
CaFT considers the initial mask as pseudo labels to train a shallow convolution
head (Attention Filter, AtF) following backbone to directly extract the mask
from tokens. Then, CaFT splits the image into parts, outputs masks respectively
and merges them into one refined mask. Finally, a new AtF is trained on the
refined masks and used to predict the box of object. Experiments verify that
CaFT outperforms previous work and achieves 97.55\% and 69.86\% localization
accuracy with ground-truth class on CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K respectively. CaFT

revisits slice-out-of-order (sOoO) cores as an energy efficient alternative for

executing \textit{slices} of MLP generating instructions out-of-order only with

by themselves, execute in-order. However, we observe that existing sOoO cores
miss significant MLP opportunities due to their dependence-oblivious in-order

a new dependence-aware slice execution policy that tracks dependent slices and
keeps them from blocking subsequent independent slices and MLP extraction. The

paper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that
firms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit
problem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents
discrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are
independent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment;
they can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work
towards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm 'Adaptive with
Weighted Exploration (AWE) $\epsilon$-greedy' which is remotely based on the
well-known $\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies
changes in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and
exploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus
enabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient
exploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes
advantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the
emergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the
scalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and
the size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in
our models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly
change their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also

upon Transformer, termed ReferFormer. It views the language as queries and
directly attends to the most relevant regions in the video frames. Concretely,
we introduce a small set of object queries conditioned on the language as the
input to the Transformer. In this manner, all the queries are obligated to find
the referred objects only. They are eventually transformed into dynamic kernels
which capture the crucial object-level information, and play the role of
convolution filters to generate the segmentation masks from feature maps. The
object tracking is achieved naturally by linking the corresponding queries
across frames. This mechanism greatly simplifies the pipeline and the
end-to-end framework is significantly different from the previous methods.
Extensive experiments on Ref-Youtube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and

differential equations (PDEs), the inverse problems are transformed into
statistical inference problems based on Bayes' formula. Recently,
infinite-dimensional Bayesian analysis methods are introduced to give a
rigorous characterization and construct dimension-independent algorithms.
However, there are three major challenges for infinite-dimensional Bayesian
methods: prior measures usually only behaves like regularizers (can hardly
incorporate prior information efficiently); complex noises (e.g., more
practical non-identically distributed noises) are rarely considered; many
computationally expensive forward PDEs need to be solved in order to estimate
posterior statistical quantities. To address these issues, we propose a general
infinite-dimensional inference framework based on a detailed analysis on the
infinite-dimensional variational inference method and the ideas of deep
generative models that are popular in the machine learning community.
Specifically, by introducing some measure equivalence assumptions, we derive
the evidence lower bound in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide
possible parametric strategies that yield a general inference framework named
variational inverting network (VINet). This inference framework has the ability
to encode prior and noise information from learning examples. In addition,
relying on the power of deep neural networks, the posterior mean and variance
can be efficiently generated in the inference stage in an explicit manner. In
numerical experiments, we design specific network structures that yield a
computable VINet from the general inference framework.Numerical examples of
linear inverse problems governed by an elliptic equation and the Helmholtz
equation are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed inference

extended to every possible orientation of the wave vector. The previous result
for the two-stream instability is recovered, and it is proved that even within
the framework of a 3D analysis, this instability remains fundamentally 1D even
when accounting for QED effects. The filamentation instability, found for wave
vectors normal to the flow, is weakly affected by QED corrections. As in the
classical case, its growth rate saturates at large $k_\perp$. The saturation
value is found independent of QED corrections. Also, the smallest unstable
$k_\perp$ is independent of QED corrections. Surprisingly, unstable modes found
for oblique wave vectors do \emph{not} follow the same pattern. For some, QED
corrections do reduce the growth rate. But for others, the same corrections
increase the growth rate instead. The possibility for QED effects to play a

Complex acoustic scenarios consisting of sources-of-interest, interfering

to the sources-of-interest a challenging task. Recently proposed attention
mechanisms allow DOA estimators to focus on the sources-of-interest and
disregard interference and noise, i.e., they are signal-aware. The attention is
typically obtained by a deep neural network (DNN) from a short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) based representation of a single microphone signal.
Subsequently, attention has been applied as binary or ratio weighting to
STFT-based microphone signal representations to reduce the impact of frequency
bins dominated by noise, interference, or reverberation. The impact of
attention on DOA estimators and different training strategies for attention and
DOA DNNs are not yet studied in depth. In this paper, we evaluate systems
consisting of different DNNs and signal processing-based methods for DOA

performed using data generated with simulated and measured room impulse
responses under various acoustic conditions, like reverberation times, noise,

the effective material and the formation of localized responses as, for
instance, shear bands. Using lattice models of elastic rods, loss of
ellipticity has always been found to occur for stress states involving
compression of the rods, as usually these structural elements buckle only under
compression. In this way, the locus of material stability for the effective

prestress. A rigorous application of homogenization theory is proposed to show
that the inclusion of sliders (constraints imposing axial and rotational

systems and machine learning. Effective encoding of the images is an essential
requirement for accurate matching. These encoding schemes play a significant
role in recognition and retrieval systems. Facial recognition systems should be
effective enough to accurately recognize individuals under intrinsic and
extrinsic variations of the system. The templates or descriptors used in these
systems encode spatial relationships of the pixels in the local neighbourhood
of an image. Features encoded using these hand crafted descriptors should be
robust against variations such as; illumination, background, poses, and
expressions. In this paper a novel hand crafted cascaded asymmetric local
pattern (CALP) is proposed for retrieval and recognition facial image. The
proposed descriptor uniquely encodes relationship amongst the neighbouring
pixels in horizontal and vertical directions. The proposed encoding scheme has
optimum feature length and shows significant improvement in accuracy under
environmental and physiological changes in a facial image. State of the art
hand crafted descriptors namely; LBP, LDGP, CSLBP, SLBP and CSLTP are compared
with the proposed descriptor on most challenging datasets namely; Caltech-face,
LFW, and CASIA-face-v5. Result analysis shows that, the proposed descriptor

descent (SGD) is a simple yet effective approach to assist the backbone SGD in
finding better optima, in terms of generalization. From a statistical
perspective, weight averaging (WA) contributes to variance reduction. Recently,
a well-established stochastic weight averaging (SWA) method is proposed, which
is featured by the application of a cyclical or high constant (CHC) learning
rate schedule (LRS) in generating weight samples for WA. Then a new insight on
WA appears, which states that WA helps to discover wider optima and then leads
to better generalization. We conduct extensive experimental studies for SWA,
involving a dozen modern DNN model structures and a dozen benchmark open-source
image, graph, and text datasets. We disentangle contributions of the WA
operation and the CHC LRS for SWA, showing that the WA operation in SWA still
contributes to variance reduction but does not always lead to wide optima. The
experimental results indicate that there are global scale geometric structures
in the DNN loss landscape. We then present an algorithm termed periodic SWA
(PSWA) which makes use of a series of WA operations to discover the global
geometric structures. PSWA outperforms its backbone SGD remarkably, providing
experimental evidences for the existence of global geometric structures. Codes

Nevertheless, simply enlarging receptive field also gives rise to several
concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention e.g., in ViT, leads to
excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by
irrelevant parts which are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand,
the sparse attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and
may limit the ability to model long range relations. To mitigate these issues,
we propose a novel deformable self-attention module, where the positions of key

optimization problems (DMMOPs) have both of these characteristics, which have
been studied in the field of evolutionary computation and swarm intelligence
for years, and attract more and more attention. Solving such problems requires
optimization algorithms to simultaneously track multiple optima in the changing

each environment according to their experiences and preferences, or quickly
turn to other solutions when the current one cannot work well. This is very
helpful for the decision makers, especially when facing changing environments.
In this competition, a test suit about DMMOPs is given, which models the
real-world applications. Specifically, this test suit adopts 8 multimodal
functions and 8 change modes to construct 24 typical dynamic multimodal
optimization problems. Meanwhile, the metric is also given to measure the
algorithm performance, which considers the average number of optimal solutions
found in all environments. This competition will be very helpful to promote the

Recent observations reveal a $1/r$ radial distribution of the CR energy
density. Here we theoretically investigate whether or not this profile can help
to distinguish between (1) continuous CR acceleration in the star cluster
stellar wind-driven shocks and (2) discrete CR acceleration in multiple
supernovae shocks -- which are often debated in the literature. Using idealized
two-fluid simulations and exploring different acceleration sites and diffusion
coefficients, we obtain the CR energy density profile and luminosity to find
the best match for the $\gamma$-ray observations. We find that the inferred CR
energy density profiles from observations of $\gamma$-ray luminosity and mass
can be much different from the true radial profile. CR acceleration at either
the cluster core region or the wind termination shock can explain the
observations, if the diffusion coefficient is $\kappa_{\rm cr}\sim 10^{27}$
cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ and a fraction of $\approx 10\%-20\%$ of the shock
power/post-shock pressure is deposited into the CR component. We also study the
possibility of discrete supernovae (SN) explosions being responsible for CR
acceleration and find that with an injection rate of 1 SN in every $\sim 0.03$
Myr, one can explain the observed $\gamma$-ray profile. This multiple SN
scenario is consistent with X-ray observations only if the thermal conductivity

observed by changing the Reynolds number and the number of modes used in the
discretization of the evolution equation? The latter point is important also to
establish regularity conditions for the reversible equations. We find that the

very quickly extremely small when increasing the effective Reynolds number of
the flow in the fully resolved hydro dynamical regime, at difference from what
was observed previously.

Practitioners evaluate the generalization ability of such CNNs by calculating
various metrics on an independent test dataset. A test dataset is often chosen
based on only one precondition, i.e., its elements are not a part of the
training data. Such a dataset may contain objects that are both similar and
novel w.r.t. the training dataset. Nevertheless, existing works do not reckon
the novelty of the test samples and treat them all equally for evaluating
generalization. Such novelty-based evaluations are of significance to validate
the fitness of a CNN in autonomous driving applications. Hence, we propose a
CNN generalization scoring framework that considers novelty of objects in the

goal of this study therefore is to refocus on the role of non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects in the formation of Be II 313.04 and
313.11 nm resonance lines in solar and stellar atmospheres. For this, we
constructed a model atom of Be using new atomic data that recently became

Be I and Be II and uses the most up-to-date collision rates with electrons and
hydrogen. This makes it the most complete model atom used to determine 1D NLTE
solar Be abundance and to study the role of NLTE effects in the formation of Be
II 313 nm resonance lines. We find that deviations from LTE have a significant
influence on the strength of the Be II 313 nm line in solar and stellar
atmospheres. For the Sun, we obtained the 1D NLTE Be abundance of A(Be)_NLTE =
1.32+/-0.05, which is in excellent agreement with the meteoritic value of

FGK stars. Moreover, there is a pronounced variation in 1D NLTE-LTE abundance
corrections with the effective temperature and metallicity. Therefore, contrary
to our previous understanding, the obtained results indicate that NLTE effects
play an important role in Be line formation in stellar atmospheres and have to
be properly taken into account in Be abundance studies, especially in
metal-poor stars.

technologies w.r.t. their market readiness. Knowing the Technology readiness
level (TRL) of a given target technology proved to be useful to mitigate risks

Originally developed for space programmes by NASA, TRL became a de facto
standard among technology and manufacturing companies and even among research
funding agencies. However, while TRL assessments provide a systematic
evaluation process resulting in meaningful metric, they are one dimensional:
they only answer the question if a technology can go into production. Hence
they leave an inherent gap, i.e., if a technology fulfils requirements with a
certain quality. This gap becomes intolerable when this metric is applied
software such as technological cybersecurity measures. With legislation such as
the General Data Protection Regulation4 (GDPR) and the Network and Information
Systems Directive5 (NIS-D) making reference to state of the art when requiring
appropriate protection measures, software designers are faced with the question
how to measure if a technology is suitable to use. We argue that there is a
potential mismatch of legal aim and technological reality which not only leads
to a risk of non-compliance, but also might lead to weaker protected systems
than possible. In that regard, we aim to address the gaps identified with
existing Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA)s and aim to overcome these by
developing standardised method which is suitable for assessing software w.r.t.

the DJSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) to be tackled by reinforcement

the action space with minimum prior domain knowledge. The attention mechanism

off-the-shelf facility for RL and DJSP research communities. Comprehensive
experiments on various DJSP instances confirm that our proposed framework is
superior to baseline algorithms with smaller makespan across all instances and
provide empirical justification for the validity of the various components in

quintic time preprocessing to achieve this delay bound. We then study how we
can reduce the preprocessing time while keeping the same delay bound, by making
additional assumptions on the grammar. Specifically, we present a class of
grammars which only have one derivation shape for all outputs, for which we can
enumerate with quadratic time preprocessing. We also give classes that

technology over best-effort networks nowadays, thanks to the myriad advantages
it brings. However, many studies have shown that HAS suffers from many Quality
of Experience (QoE)-related issues in the presence of competing players. This
is mainly caused by the selfishness of the players resulting from the
decentralized intelligence given to the player. Another limitation is the
bottleneck link that could happen at any time during the streaming session and
anywhere in the network. These issues may result in wobbling bandwidth
perception by the players and could lead to missing the deadline for chunk
downloads, which result in the most annoying issue consisting of rebuffering
events. In this paper, we leverage the SoftwareDefined Networking paradigm to
take advantage of the global view of the network and its powerful intelligence
that allows reacting to the network changing conditions. Ultimately, we aim at
preventing the re-buffering events, resulting from deadline misses, and
ensuring high QoE for the accepted clients in the system. To this end, we use
Deterministic Network Calculus (DNC) to guarantee a maximum delay for the
download of the video chunks while maximizing the perceived video quality.
Simulation results show that the proposed solution ensures high efficiency for
the accepted clients without any rebuffering events which result in high user
QoE. Consequently, it might be highly useful for scenarios where video chunks
should be strictly downloaded on-time or ensuring low delay with high user QoE

Virtualization (NFV) technology enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to
flexibly place Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) achieving performance and cost

through a series of VNF instances in a predefined order. Moreover, the required
network resources and placement of VNF instances along SFC should be optimized
to meet the deterministic latency requirements. Therefore, it is significant
for ISPs to determine an optimal SFC deployment strategy to ensure network
performance while improving the network revenue. In this paper, we jointly
investigate the resource allocation and SFC placement in 5G edge networks for
deterministic latency assurance. We formulate this problem as a mathematic

Standard Model (SM). Recently, models with no dimensionful parameters in the
tree-level action have been attracting much attention because they can predict
a very strong FOPT with ultra-supercooling. In this paper, we study the
cosmological signatures of such a supercooling model. As a concrete model, we
consider the SM with two additional real scalars $\phi$ and $S$, which can
realize the electroweak symmetry breaking via Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. One
of the additional scalars $S$ can naturally become a Dark Matter (DM) candidate
due to the $Z_2^{}$ symmetry of the action. We study the FOPT of this model and
calculate the Gravitational Wave (GW) signals and the thermal relic abundance
of $S$ taking the filtered effects into account. Within the envelope
approximation, we find that the GW peak amplitude can reach $\sim 10^{-10}$
around the frequency $f\sim 10^{-3}~$Hz for model parameters
$(v_\phi^{},\lambda_{\phi S}^{})\sim (200~{\rm TeV},1.6)$ where $v_\phi^{}$ is
the vacuum expectation value of $\phi$ and $\lambda_{\phi S}^{}$ is the scalar
mixing coupling. On the other hand, the filtered DM mechanism only works for
$0.8\lesssim \lambda_{\phi S}^{}\lesssim 1$, where the GW peak amplitude is
found to be quite small $\lesssim 10^{-17}$.

multi-agent actor-critic (MAAC) algorithm for Markov games. Unlike previous
MAAC algorithms, 3DPG is fully distributed during both training and deployment.
3DPG agents calculate local policy gradients based on the most recently
available local data (states, actions) and local policies of other agents.
During training, this information is exchanged using a potentially lossy and
delaying communication network. The network therefore induces Age of
Information (AoI) for data and policies. We prove the asymptotic convergence of
3DPG even in the presence of potentially unbounded Age of Information (AoI).
This provides an important step towards practical online and distributed
multi-agent learning since 3DPG does not assume information to be available
deterministically. We analyze 3DPG in the presence of policy and data transfer
under mild practical assumptions. Our analysis shows that 3DPG agents converge
to a local Nash equilibrium of Markov games in terms of utility functions
expressed as the expected value of the agents local approximate action-value
functions (Q-functions). The expectations of the local Q-functions are with
respect to limiting distributions over the global state-action space shaped by
the agents' accumulated local experiences. Our results also shed light on the
policies obtained by general MAAC algorithms. We show through a heuristic
argument and numerical experiments that 3DPG improves convergence over previous
MAAC algorithms that use old actions instead of old policies during training.
Further, we show that 3DPG is robust to AoI; it learns competitive policies
even with large AoI and low data availability.

characteristic of the field. A first observation is that for a fixed prime $p$
either the $i$-th Betti number of all high enough powers of a monomial ideal
differs in characteristic $0$ and in characteristic $p$ or it is the same for
all high enough powers. In our main results we provide constructions and
explicit examples of monomial ideals all of whose powers have some
characteristic-dependent Betti numbers or whose asymptotic regularity depends
on the field. We prove that, adding a monomial on new variables to a monomial
ideal, allows to spread the characteristic dependence to all powers. For any
given prime $p$, this produces an edge ideal such that the Betti numbers of all
its powers over $\mathbb{Q}$ and over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ are different. Moreover,
we show that, for every $r \geq 0$ and $i \geq 3$ there is a monomial ideal $I$
such that some coefficient in a degree $\geq r$ of the Kodiyalam polynomials
$\mathfrak P_3(I),\ldots,\mathfrak P_{i+r}(I)$ depends on the characteristic.

particular, the exclusive width difference and the inclusive counterpart can be
compared within the 't Hooft model, two-dimensional QCD in the large-$N_c$

infrastructure from which yearlong datasets using 21 aerosol chemical
speciation monitors (ACSMs) and 1 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) were gathered
during 2013-2019. It includes 9 non-urban and 13 urban sites. This study
developed a state-of-the-art source apportionment protocol to analyse long-term
OA mass spectrum data by applying the most advanced source apportionment
strategies (i.e., rolling PMF, ME-2, and bootstrap). This harmonised protocol
enables the quantifications of the most common OA components such as
hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass burning OA (BBOA), cooking-like OA (COA),
more oxidised-oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), and less oxidised-oxygenated OA (LO-OOA).
Other components such as coal combustion OA (CCOA), solid fuel OA (SFOA: mainly
mixture of coal and peat combustion), cigarette smoke OA (CSOA), sea salt
(mostly inorganic but part of the OA mass spectrum), coffee OA, and ship
industry OA could also be separated at a few specific sites. Oxygenated OA
(OOA) components make up most of the submicron OA mass (average = 71.1%, a
range of 43.7-100%). Solid fuel combustion-related OA components (i.e., BBOA,
CCOA, and SFOA) are still considerable with in total 16.0% yearly contribution
to the OA, yet mainly during winter months (21.4%). Overall, this comprehensive
protocol works effectively across all sites governed by different sources and
generates robust and consistent source apportionment results. Our work presents
a comprehensive overview of OA sources in Europe with a unique combination of
high time resolution and long-term data coverage (9-36 months), providing

neutrino flux employing the ""luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE)""
model for the AGN luminosity function (LF) is found consistent with the IceCube
level if only a fraction, $6.56\%$ of the total bolometric luminosity (BL) of
AGN is being realizable to power the PeV neutrinos. In the $\Lambda$~CDM

on classes of FLRW cosmological models in which the matter side of Einstein's
equations includes, in addition to the canonical term, a term proportional to
some function of the energy-momentum tensor
($T^2=T_{\alpha\beta}T^{\alpha\beta}=\rho^2+3p^2$), or of its trace
($T=\rho-3p$). Qualitatively, one may think of these models as extensions of
general relativity with a nonlinear matter Lagrangian. As such they are
somewhat different from the usual dynamical dark energy or modified gravity
models: in the former class of models one adds further dynamical degrees of
freedom to the Lagrangian (often in the form of scalar fields), while in the
latter the gravitational part of the Lagrangian is changed. We study both of
these models under two different scenarios: (1) as phenomenological
two-parameter or three-parameter extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM, in
which case the model still has a cosmological constant but the nonlinear matter
Lagrangian leads to additional terms in Einstein's equations, which
cosmological observations tightly constrain, and (2) as alternatives to
$\Lambda$CDM, where there is no cosmological constant, and the nonlinear matter
term would have to provide the acceleration (which would be somewhat closer in
spirit to the usual modified gravity models). A comparative analysis of the
observational constraints obtained in the various cases provides some insight
on the level of robustness of the $\Lambda$ model and on the parameter space
still available for phenomenological alternatives.

properties of gas (velocity, temperature, and density) is first analysed around
415 galaxy cluster environments from IllustrisTNG simulation at z = 0
(TNG300-1). Whereas hot plasma is virialised inside clusters (< R200), the
dynamics of warm hot inter-galactic medium (WHIM) can be separated in two
regimes: accumulating and slowly infalling gas at cluster peripheries and fast
infalling motions outside clusters (> 1.5R200). The azimuthal distribution of
dark matter (DM), hot and warm gas phases is secondly statistically probed by
decomposing their 2-D distribution in harmonic space. Inside clusters, the
azimuthal symmetries of DM and hot gas are well tracing cluster structural
properties, such as their center offsets, substructure fractions and elliptical
shapes. Beyond cluster virialised regions, we find that WHIM gas follows the
azimuthal distribution of DM thus tracing cosmic filament patterns. Azimuthal
symmetries of hot and warm gas distribution are finally shown to be imprints of
cluster mass assembly history, strongly correlated with the formation time,
mass accretion rate, and dynamical state of clusters. Azimuthal mode

and their joint integration (adjustment) together with all raw inertial and
GNSS observations. This is performed in a tightly coupled fashion using a
Dynamic Network approach that results in an optimally compensated trajectory
through modeling of errors at the sensor, rather than the trajectory, level.
The 3D correspondences are formulated as static conditions within this network
and the registered point cloud is generated with higher accuracy utilizing the
corrected trajectory and possibly other parameters determined within the
adjustment. We first describe the method for selecting correspondences and how
they are inserted into the Dynamic Network as new observation models. We then
describe the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework in practical airborne laser scanning scenarios with low-cost MEMS
inertial sensors. In the conducted experiments, the method proposed to
establish 3D correspondences is effective in determining point--to--point
matches across a wide range of geometries such as trees, buildings and cars.
Our results demonstrate that the method improves the point cloud registration
accuracy, that is otherwise strongly affected by errors in the determined
platform attitude or position (in nominal and emulated GNSS outage conditions),
and possibly determine unknown boresight angles using only a fraction of the
total number of 3D correspondences that are established.

clusters identified by combining red-sequence and blue-cloud surveys, covering
a wide range of emitter fractions (i.e., 0.3--0.8). The spatial extent of the
over-density region of emitter galaxies was approximately 1~Mpc in radius. The
average cluster mass was estimated as $0.6 (<1.5)\times10^{14}~{\rm M_\odot}$
from the stacked weak-lensing measurement. We analyzed the XMM-Newton archival
data, and measured the X-ray luminosity of the hot intracluster medium. As a
result, diffuse X-ray emission was marginally detected in 14 clusters, yielding
an average luminosity of $5\times 10^{42}~{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. On the contrary,
it was not significant in 29 clusters. The blue clusters were significantly
fainter than the red-dominated clusters, and the X-ray luminosity did not show
any meaningful correlation either with emitter fraction or richness. The X-ray
surface brightness was low, but the amount of gas mass was estimated to be
comparable to that observed in the $10^{13-14}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ cluster. Based
on the results, we suggest that the blue clusters are at the early formation
stage, and the gas is yet to be compressed and heated up to produce appreciable
X-rays. Follow-up spectroscopic measurements are essential to clarify the
dynamical status and co-evolution of galaxies and hot gas in the blue clusters.

Using the dynamical structure factor and Van-Hove correlation function, we
interrogate the jump-time, hopping length distribution and associated diffusion
coefficients. In cubic-Cu2Se at 500 K, we find solid-like diffusion with
Cu-jump lengths matching well the first-neighbour Cu-Cu distance of ~3 {\AA} in
the crystal, and clearly defined optic phonons involving Cu-vibrations. Above
700 K, the jump-length distribution becomes a broad maximum cantered around 4
{\AA}, spanning the first and second neighbour lattice distances, and a
concurrent broadening of the Cu-phonon density of states. Further, above 900 K,
the Cu-diffusion becomes close to liquid-like, with distributions of Cu-atoms
continuously connecting crystal sites, while the vibrational modes involving Cu
motions are highly damped, though still not fully over-damped as in a liquid.
At low temperatures, the solid-like diffusion is consistent with previous X-ray
diffraction and quasielastic neutron scattering experiments, while the
higher-temperature observation of the liquid-like diffusion is in agreement
with previous AIMD simulations. We also report AIMD simulations in Cu2S in the
hexagonal and cubic superionic phases, and observe similar solid and
liquid-like diffusion at low- and high-temperatures, respectively. The
calculated ionic-conductivity is in fair agreement with reported experimental
values.

receive substantial supersymmetric (SUSY) radiative corrections which have
prominent dependencies on the NHSSM-specific trilinear soft parameters,
$A_b^\prime$ and $A_{\tau}^\prime$, respectively, in addition to their
well-known dependence on $\tan\beta$ as is already present in the Minimal SUSY
Standard Model (MSSM). We study to what extent these could affect the
production cross sections of the heavy Higgs bosons ($H$ and $A$) in
association with a pair of $b$-quarks and their decay branching ratios, in
particular, to a $\tau\bar{\tau}$ pair and compare them with those obtained in
the MSSM. Requiring compliance with the recently observed upper bounds on the
product of their total cross-section and the branching ratio to
$\tau\bar{\tau}$ at the 13 TeV run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), with
data worth 139 fb$^{-1}$, results in an altered exclusion region in the
customary $m_A-\tan\beta$ plane in the framework of the NHSSM when compared to
what is derived by the LHC experiments within an MSSM setup. Such alterations
are estimated to be pronounced only for large $\tan\beta$ ($\geq 40$) and for
large, negative $A_b^\prime$ when one finds a reinforced exclusion of the
$m_A-\tan\beta$ plane with an excluded $m_A$ value larger by $\approx 200$ GeV,
compared to the MSSM case, at $\tan\beta=60$. On the other hand, the maximum
relaxation in $m_A$, for a similarly large but positive $A_b^\prime$, barely
exceeds $\approx 100$ GeV as a result of complementary variations in production
cross-sections and decay branching fractions of the heavy, neutral Higgs
bosons.

received attention because of their potentials in spintronic and communication
applications. Besides wave amplitude and frequency, spin-wave has its third
character: handedness, whose manipulation is certainly of interest. We propose
in this Letter that the handedness of low energy spin-wave excitations can be
controlled by tuning the net angular momentum {\delta}s in a ferrimagnetic
(FiM) domain wall, attributing to the inequivalent magnetic sublattices. The
results indicate that the spin-wave dispersion depends on both {\delta}s and
wave handedness. For a positive (negative) {\delta}s, a gapless dispersion is
observed for the left-handed (righ-handed) spin waves, while a frequency gap
appears for the right-handed (left-handed) spin waves. Thus a FiM wall could
serve as a multifold filter of low energy spin-wave in which only spin waves
with particular handedness can propagate. Furthermore, the energy consumption
loss for spin-wave excitation in the wall is much lower than that inside the
domain, while the group velocity is much faster too, demonstrating the
advantages of domain walls serving as spin waveguides. Moreover, the
current-induced spin-wave Doppler shift in the FiM wall is also revealed, and
can be controlled by {\delta}s. This work unveils for the first time the
interesting spin-wave dynamics in FiM domain walls, benefiting future spin-wave
applications.

semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to
instance prediction. Our key contributions are three-fold: 1) the instance
symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved
by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module
explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relation among
vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encoding (CEE)
module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them
as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is
intuitive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic symbol spotting

Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to observe the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$
$J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition of OD at 1.3 THz ($215~\mu$m) and the
rotationally excited OH line at 1.84 THz ($163~\mu$m). We also used published
high-spectral-resolution SOFIA data of the OH ground-state transition at 2.51
THz ($119.3~\mu$m). Our results show that absorption from the $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ OD
$J=5/2-3/2$ ground-state transition is prevalent in the dense clumps
surrounding active sites of high-mass star formation. We performed detailed
radiative transfer modelling to investigate the OD abundance profile in the
inner envelope for a large fraction of our sample. Our modelling suggests that
part of the absorption arises from the denser inner parts, while the bulk of it
as seen with SOFIA originates in the outer, cold layers of the envelope for
which our constraints on the molecular abundance suggest a strong enhancement
in deuterium fractionation. We find a weak negative correlation between the OD
abundance and the bolometric luminosity to mass ratio, an evolutionary
indicator, suggesting a slow decrease of OD abundance with time. A comparison
with HDO shows a similarly high deuterium fractionation for the two species in
the cold envelopes, which is of the order of 0.48% for the best studied source,
G34.26+0.15. Our results are consistent with chemical models that favour rapid
exchange reactions to form OD in the dense cold gas.

beta threshold for the 1/1 EIC excitation, the further destabilization of the

triggering of burst events. The frequency of the 1/1 EIC calculated during the
burst event is 9.4 kHz and the 2/2 and 3/3 overtones are destabilized,
consistent with the frequency range and the complex mode structure measured in
the experiment. In addition, the simulation shows the inward propagation of the
1/1 EIC due to the non linear destabilization of the 3/4 and 2/3 EPMs, leading
to the partial overlapping between resonances during the burst event. Finally,
the analysis of the 1/1 EIC stabilization phase shows the excitation of the 1/1
RIC as soon as the flattening induced by the 1/1 EIC in the pressure profile
vanishes, leading to the retrieval of the pressure gradient at the plasma
periphery and the overcoming of the RIC stability limit.

RNdS black hole by a minimal coupled neutral massless scalar field at the
linear perturbation level. For the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory
which is famous for the spontaneous scalarization phenomenon, there exists the

investigate the extendibility of the metric beyond the Cauchy horizon in the

bijections from $V(X)$ to $V(Y)$, with bijections $\sigma, \tau$ adjacent if

and $\mathcal Y_L$ for all integers $L \geq 1$ to show that diameters of
connected components of friends-and-strangers graphs fail to be polynomially
bounded in the size of $X$ and $Y$, resolving a question raised by Alon,
Defant, and Kravitz in the negative. Specifically, our construction yields that
there exist infinitely many values of $n$ for which there are $n$-vertex graphs
$X$ and $Y$ with the diameter of a component of $\mathsf{FS}(X, Y)$ at least
$n^{(\log n)/(\log \log n)}$. We also study the diameters of components of

diameter at most $|E(Y)|$, and $\text{diam}(\mathsf{FS}(\text{Cycle}_n, Y))$ is
$O(n^3)$ whenever $\mathsf{FS}(\text{Cycle}_n, Y)$ is connected. We conclude
the work with several conjectures that aim to generalize this latter result.

generator $M$ can be considered as 'Canonical' for the following reasons : (C1)
the probability of the trajectory $x(0 \leq t \leq T)$ can be rewritten as the
exponential of a linear combination of its relevant empirical time-averaged
observables $E_n$, where the coefficients involving the Markov generator are
their fixed conjugate parameters; (C2) the large deviations properties of these
empirical observables $E_n$ for large $T$ are governed by the explicit rate
function $I^{[2.5]}_M (E_.) $ at Level 2.5, while in the thermodynamic limit
$T=+\infty$, they concentrate on their typical values $E_n^{typ[M]}$ determined
by the Markov generator $M$. This concentration property in the thermodynamic
limit $T=+\infty$ suggests to introduce the notion of the 'Microcanonical
Ensemble' at Level 2.5 for stochastic trajectories $x(0 \leq t \leq T)$, where
all the relevant empirical variables $E_n$ are fixed to some values $E^*_n$ and
cannot fluctuate anymore for finite $T$. The goal of the present paper is to
discuss its main properties : (MC1) when the long trajectory $x(0 \leq t \leq
T) $ belongs the Microcanonical Ensemble with the fixed empirical observables
$E_n^*$, the statistics of its subtrajectory $x(0 \leq t \leq \tau) $ for $1
\ll \tau \ll T $ is governed by the Canonical Ensemble associated to the Markov
generator $M^*$ that would make the empirical observables $E_n^*$ typical ;
(MC2) in the Microcanonical Ensemble, the central role is played by the number
$\Omega^{[2.5]}_T(E^*_.) $ of stochastic trajectories of duration $T$ with the
given empirical observables $E^*_n$, and by the corresponding explicit
Boltzmann entropy $S^{[2.5]}( E^*_. ) = [\ln \Omega^{[2.5]}_T(E^*_.)]/T $. This
general framework is applied to continuous-time Markov Jump processes and to
discrete-time Markov chains with illustrative examples.

been proposed. However, in practice, those backdoor attacks are vulnerable to
image compressions. When backdoor instances are compressed, the feature of
specific backdoor trigger will be destroyed, which could result in the backdoor
attack performance deteriorating. In this paper, we propose a
compression-resistant backdoor attack based on feature consistency training. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first backdoor attack that is robust to
image compressions. First, both backdoor images and their compressed versions
are input into the deep neural network (DNN) for training. Then, the feature of
each image is extracted by internal layers of the DNN. Next, the feature
difference between backdoor images and their compressed versions are minimized.
As a result, the DNN treats the feature of compressed images as the feature of
backdoor images in feature space. After training, the backdoor attack against
DNN is robust to image compression. Furthermore, we consider three different
image compressions (i.e., JPEG, JPEG2000, WEBP) in feature consistency
training, so that the backdoor attack is robust to multiple image compression
algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness
of the proposed backdoor attack. When the backdoor instances are compressed,
the attack success rate of common backdoor attack is lower than 10%, while the
attack success rate of our compression-resistant backdoor is greater than 97%.
The compression-resistant attack is still robust even when the backdoor images
are compressed with low compression quality. In addition, extensive experiments
have demonstrated that, our compression-resistant backdoor attack has the
generalization ability to resist image compression which is not used in the
training process.

work we aim to change that. We establish the Lyapunov equation as a fundamental
and efficient formalism for linear open quantum systems that can go beyond the
limitations of various standard quantum master equation descriptions, while
remaining of much less complexity than general exact formalisms. This also
provides valuable insights for non-Hermitian quantum physics. In particular, we
derive the Lyapunov equation for the most general number conserving linear
system in a lattice of arbitrary dimension and geometry, connected to an
arbitrary number of baths at different temperatures and chemical potentials.
Three slightly different forms of the Lyapunov equation are derived via an
equation of motion approach, by making increasing levels of controlled
approximations, without reference to any quantum master equation. Then we
discuss their relation with quantum master equations, positivity, accuracy and
additivity issues, the possibility of describing dark states, general
perturbative solutions in terms of single-particle eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the system, and quantum regression formulas. Our derivation gives a clear
understanding of the origin of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing the

holes are unique observational probes to the background spacetime since they
can be directly related to the timescales associated with the motion of matter
orbiting in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. In this regard, the high
frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) are particularly interesting as they occur in
commensurable pairs, the most common ratio being the 3:2 twin peak QPOs. The
theoretical models which aim to explain these QPOs express the observed
frequencies in terms of the epicyclic motion of test particles in a given
background spacetime. In this work we study the signatures of Bardeen spacetime
from the observed QPOs in the black hole power spectrum. Bardeen black holes
are rotating, regular black holes with a magnetic monopole charge. Such regular
backgrounds are theoretically interesting as they can potentially evade the
curvature singularity, otherwise unavoidable in general relativistic black
holes. We perform a chi-square analysis by comparing the available observations
of the quasi-periodic oscillations from black hole sources with the relevant
theoretical models and note that the Kerr black holes in general relativity are
observationally more favored compared to black holes with a monopole charge.
Our analysis reveals that black holes with very high monopole charge are
disfavored from QPO related observations.

significantly depending on the initial position, even for a tiny Peccei-Quinn
breaking that satisfies the experimental bound of the neutron electric dipole
measurements. If the axion first starts to oscillate around a wrong vacuum and
if it gets trapped there until the false vacuum disappears due to
non-perturbative QCD effects, its abundance increases significantly and is
independent of the decay constant $f_a$, as first pointed out in [JHEP 06

dark matter even when the decay constant is close to the lower limit due to
stellar cooling arguments. On the other hand, if the axion starts to oscillate
about a potential minimum close to the low-energy vacuum, its abundance is
significantly reduced because of the adiabatic suppression mechanism. This
relaxes the upper limit of the axion window to large values of $f_a$. We also
discuss how the axionic isocurvature perturbation is affected by the
Peccei-Quinn breaking term, and show that it can be suppressed in both regimes.
In particular, the isocurvature bound on the inflation scale is relaxed by many
orders of magnitudes for $f_a \lesssim 10^{11}{\rm GeV}$ compared to the
conventional scenario.

identification of publications to read, cite or consider as related papers
relies on a researcher's ability to identify fitting keywords or initial papers
from which a literature search can be started. The rapidly increasing amount of
papers has called for automatic measures to find the desired relevant
publications, so-called paper recommendation systems.
  As the number of publications increases so does the amount of paper
recommendation systems. Former literature reviews focused on discussing the
general landscape of approaches throughout the years and highlight the main
directions. We refrain from this perspective, instead we only consider a
comparatively small time frame but analyse it fully.
  In this literature review we discuss used methods, datasets, evaluations and
open challenges encountered in all works first released between January 2019
and October 2021. The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive and
complete overview of current paper recommendation systems.

collection of pairwise disjoint strictly convex compact obstacles. Let $\mu_j
\in {\mathbb C},\: {\rm Im}\: \mu_j > 0,$ be the resonances of the Laplacian in
the exterior of $D$ with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial
D$. For $d$ odd, $u(t) = \sum_j e^{i |t| \mu_j}$ is a distribution in $
\mathcal{D}'({\mathbb R} \setminus \{0\})$ and the Laplace transforms of the
leading singularities of $u(t)$ yield the dynamical zeta functions
$\eta_{\mathrm N},\: \eta_{\mathrm D}$ for Neumann and Dirichlet boundary
conditions, respectively. These zeta functions play a crucial role in the
analysis of the distribution of the resonances. Under the non-eclipse condition
(1.1), for $d \geqslant 2$ we show that $\eta_{\mathrm N}$ and $\eta_\mathrm D$
admit a meromorphic continuation in the whole complex plane. In the particular
case when the boundary $\partial D$ is real analytic, by using a result of
Fried (1995), we prove that the function $\eta_\mathrm{D}$ cannot be entire.
Following the result of Ikawa (1988), this implies the existence of a strip
$\{z \in {\mathbb C}: \: 0 < {\rm Im}\: z \leq\alpha\}$ containing an infinite
number of resonances $\mu_j$ for the Dirichlet problem.

materials for next generation electronics, however a reliable and controllable
synthesis method is still lacking. Here, we report the CVD growth of GNRs on a
copper surface and the corresponding mechanisms of growth. One-dimensional GNR
growth is enabled by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) graphene growth guided by
on-surface propagation of a liquid catalyst particle. Controlling the
suppression of vapor-solid-solid (VSS) graphene growth along the width
direction of the GNR by tuning the flow of H2 during growth gives rise to a
spear head-shaped graphene that we term graphene nanospears (GNSs). The
real-time visual and spatially resolved observations confirm the VSS growth of
graphene can be fully suppressed and lead to GNR formation on Cu surface. These
findings reveal key insight into the growth mechanism of graphene and open a
door for achieving a facile and scalable method of synthesizing free standing
GNRs.

long-standing issues regarding nonlinear electron plasma waves (EPW's). First,
we discuss the relevance, and practical usefulness, of stationary solutions to
the Vlasov-Poisson system, the so-called Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal modes, to
model slowly varying waves. Second, we derive an upper bound for the wave
breaking limit of an EPW growing in an initially Maxwellian plasma. Moreover,
we show a simple dependence of this limit as a function of $k\lambda_D$, $k$
being the wavenumber and $\lambda_D$ the Debye length. Third, we explicitly
derive the envelope equation ruling the evolution of a slowly growing plasma
wave, up to an amplitude close to the wave breaking limit. Fourth, we estimate
the growth of the transverse wavenumbers resulting from wavefront bowing by
solving the nonlinear, nonstationary, ray tracing equations for the EPW,
together with a simple model for stimulated Raman scattering.

to retrieve fundamental material viscoelastic properties. Recently, the
extension to a three-dimensional imaging modality has paved the way to novel
exciting opportunities in the biomedical field, yet the detection of the
Brillouin spectrum remains challenging as a consequence of the dominant elastic
background light that typically overwhelms the inelastic Brillouin peaks. In
this Letter, we demonstrate a fully integrated and ultra-compact Brillouin
notch filter based on an optical ring resonator fabricated on a silicon nitride
platform. Our on-chip ring resonator filter was measured to have a 10 dB
extinction ratio and a Q factor of 1.9x10^5. The experimental results provide a
proof-of-concept on the ability of the on-chip filter to attenuate the elastic
background light, heralding future developments of fully integrated,
ultra-compact and low-cost Brillouin spectrometers.

which can be produced by spinning neutron stars with an asymmetry around their
rotation axis, using data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and
Advanced Virgo detectors. Four different analysis methods are used to search in
a gravitational-wave frequency band from 10 to 2048 Hz and a first frequency
derivative from $-10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ Hz/s. No statistically-significant
periodic gravitational-wave signal is observed by any of the four searches. As
a result, upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude $h_0$ are
calculated. The best upper limits are obtained in the frequency range of 100 to
200 Hz and they are ${\sim}1.1\times10^{-25}$ at 95\% confidence-level. The
minimum upper limit of $1.10\times10^{-25}$ is achieved at a frequency 111.5
Hz. We also place constraints on the rates and abundances of nearby planetary-
and asteroid-mass primordial black holes that could give rise to continuous
gravitational-wave signals.

sixth-order algebraic equation for one component and subsequently equations for
the other two. Linearizing the equations of motion, a dispersion equation for
the wobbling frequency is obtained. The equations of motion are also considered
in the reduced space of generalized phase space coordinates. Choosing
successively the three axes as quantization axis will lead to analytical
solutions for the wobbling frequency, respectively. The same analysis is
performed for the chirally transformed Hamiltonian. With an illustrative
example one identified wobbling states whose frequencies are mirror image to

both offline and online settings, which can benefit wide applications in
machine learning and operations research areas. We present a boosting framework
covering gradient ascent and online gradient ascent. The fundamental ingredient
of our methods is a novel non-oblivious function $F$ derived from a
factor-revealing optimization problem, whose any stationary point provides a
$(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation to the global maximum of the $\gamma$-weakly
DR-submodular objective function $f\in C^{1,1}_L(\mathcal{X})$. Under the
offline scenario, we propose a boosting gradient ascent method achieving
$(1-e^{-\gamma}-\epsilon^{2})$-approximation after $O(1/\epsilon^2)$
iterations, which improves the $(\frac{\gamma^2}{1+\gamma^2})$ approximation
ratio of the classical gradient ascent algorithm. In the online setting, for
the first time we consider the adversarial delays for stochastic gradient
feedback, under which we propose a boosting online gradient algorithm with the
same non-oblivious function $F$. Meanwhile, we verify that this boosting online
algorithm achieves a regret of $O(\sqrt{D})$ against a
$(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation to the best feasible solution in hindsight,
where $D$ is the sum of delays of gradient feedback. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first result to obtain $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret against a
$(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation with $O(1)$ gradient inquiry at each time step,
when no delay exists, i.e., $D=T$. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our boosting methods.

changes drastically the phenomenology of the rotationally-invariant case,
destroying long-range correlations, pinning the direction of global order, and
transforming the traveling bands of the coexistence phase into a single moving
domain. All this happens beyond a lengthscale that diverges in the $q\to\infty$
limit. A phenomenology akin to that of the Vicsek model can thus be observed in
a finite system for large enough values of $q$. We provide a scaling argument
which rationalizes why anisotropy has so different effects in the passive and
active cases.

$\lambda$-contractivity conditions are provided under which safety and
stability of the LPV systems are unified through Minkowski functions of the
safe sets. Then, to bypass the requirement to identify the system dynamics, a
data-based representation of the closed-loop LPV system is provided to directly
exploit collected data and construct a safe controller. It is shown that weaker
data richness requirements are needed to directly learn a closed-loop safe
control policy than to identify the LPV system. The closed-loop data-based
representation is leveraged to directly design data-driven gain-scheduling
controllers that guarantee $\lambda$-contractiveness, and, thus, invariance of
the safe sets. It is also shown that the problem of designing a data-driven
gain-scheduling controller for a polyhedral (ellipsoidal) safe set amounts to a
linear program (a semi-definite program). A simulation example is provided to

  localization noise",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we address the problem of registering multiple point clouds
corrupted with high anisotropic localization noise. Our approach follows the
widely used framework of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) reconstruction with an
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Existing methods are based on an
implicit assumption of space-invariant isotropic Gaussian noise. However, this
assumption is violated in practice in applications such as single molecule
localization microscopy (SMLM). To address this issue, we propose to introduce
an explicit localization noise model that decouples shape modeling with the GMM
from noise handling. We design a stochastic EM algorithm that considers
noise-free data as a latent variable, with closed-form solutions at each EM
step. The first advantage of our approach is to handle space-variant and
anisotropic Gaussian noise with arbitrary covariances. The second advantage is
to leverage the explicit noise model to impose prior knowledge about the noise
that may be available from physical sensors. We show on various simulated data
that our noise handling strategy improves significantly the robustness to high
levels of anisotropic noise. We also demonstrate the performance of our method
on real SMLM data.

are carefully revisited and compared with those of CaCuO2 and RNiO3
perovskites. Combining first-principles and finite-temperature
second-principles calculations, we highlight that bulk NdNiO2 compound are far
from equivalent to CaCuO2, together at the structural, electronic, and magnetic
levels. Structurally, it is shown to be prone to spin-phonon coupling induced
oxygen square rotation motion, which might be responsible for the intriguing
upturn of the resistivity. At the electronic and magnetic levels, we point out
orbital-selective Mott localization with strong out-of-plane band dispersion,
which should result in the isotropic upper critical fields and weakly
three-dimensional magnetic interactions with in-plane local moment and
out-of-plane itinerant moment. We further demonstrate that as in RNiO3
perovskites, oxygen rotation motion and rare-earth ion controlled electronic
and magnetic properties can give rise in RNiO2 compounds to a rich phase
diagram and high tunability of various appealing properties. In line with that,
we reveal that key ingredients of high-Tc superconductor such as orbital
polarization, Fermi surface, and antiferromagnetic interactions can be
deliberately controlled in NdNiO2 through epitaxial strain. Exploiting
strain-orbital engineering, a crossover from three- to two-dimensional magnetic
transition can be established, making then NdNiO2 thin film a true analog of
high-Tc cuprates.

analysed in terms of the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics.
  We complement the observations from the STIX instrument with EUV imagery from
SDO/AIA and GOES soft X-ray data by adding imaging and plasma diagnostics over
different temperature ranges for a detailed microflare case study that is
focussed on energy release and transport.
  Spectral fitting of the STIX data shows clear nonthermal emission for both
microflares studied here. The deduced plasma parameters from DEM reconstruction
as well as spectral fitting roughly agree with the values in the literature for
microflares as do the nonthermal fit parameters from STIX. The observed Neupert
effects and impulsive and gradual phases indicate that both events covered in
this study are consistent with the standard chromospheric evaporation flare
scenario. For the B6 event on 7 June 2020, this interpretation is further
supported by the temporal evolution seen in the DEM profiles of the flare
ribbons and loops. For this event, we also find that accelerated electrons can
roughly account for the required thermal energy. The 6 June 2020 event
demonstrates that STIX can detect nonthermal emission for GOES class B2 events
that is nonetheless smaller than the background rate level. We demonstrate for
the first time how detailed multi-instrument studies of solar flares can be
performed with STIX.

semi-supervised multi-view learning models. However, existing strategies cannot
take advantage of semi-supervised information, only distinguishing the
importance of views from a data feature perspective, which is often influenced
by low-quality views then leading to poor performance. In this paper, by
establishing a link between labeled data and the importance of different views,
we propose an auto-weighted strategy to evaluate the importance of views from a
label perspective to avoid the negative impact of unimportant or low-quality
views. Based on this strategy, we propose a transductive semi-supervised
auto-weighted multi-view classification model. The initialization of the
proposed model can be effectively determined by labeled data, which is
practical. The model is decoupled into three small-scale sub-problems that can
efficiently be optimized with a local convergence guarantee. The experimental
results on classification tasks show that the proposed method achieves optimal
or sub-optimal classification accuracy at the lowest computational cost
compared to other related methods, and the weight change experiments show that
our proposed strategy can distinguish view importance more accurately than
other related strategies on multi-view datasets with low-quality views.

Countries like Brazil have had difficulty in dealing with the virus due to the
high socioeconomic difference of states and municipalities. Therefore, this
study presents a new approach using different machine learning and deep
learning algorithms applied to Brazilian COVID-19 data. First, a clustering
algorithm is used to identify counties with similar sociodemographic behavior,
while Benford's law is used to check for data manipulation. Based on these
results we are able to correctly model SARIMA models based on the clusters to
predict new daily cases. The unsupervised machine learning techniques optimized
the process of defining the parameters of the SARIMA model. This framework can
also be useful to propose confinement scenarios during the so-called second

produce important results when dealing with pandemic data. Although the
findings cannot be used exclusively to assess and influence policy decisions,
they offer an alternative to the ineffective measures that have been used.

it allows to operate more efficiently and to react in advance. In this work, we

clusters in heterogeneous polycrystalline materials. Prior work on using
machine learning in the context of mechanics has largely focused on predicting
the effective response and overall structure of stress fields. However, their
ability to predict peak stresses -- which are of critical importance to failure
-- is unexplored, because the peak-stress clusters occupy a small spatial
volume relative to the entire domain, and hence requires computationally
expensive training. This work develops a deep-learning based Convolutional
Encoder-Decoder method that focuses on predicting peak-stress clusters,
specifically on the size and other characteristics of the clusters in the
framework of heterogeneous linear elasticity. This method is based on
convolutional filters that model local spatial relations between
microstructures and stress fields using spatially weighted averaging
operations. The model is first trained against linear elastic calculations of
stress under applied macroscopic strain in synthetically-generated
microstructures, which serves as the ground truth. The trained model is then
applied to predict the stress field given a (synthetically-generated)
microstructure and then to detect peak-stress clusters within the predicted
stress field. The accuracy of the peak-stress predictions is analyzed using the
cosine similarity metric and by comparing the geometric characteristics of the
peak-stress clusters against the ground-truth calculations. It is observed that
the model is able to learn and predict the geometric details of the peak-stress
clusters and, in particular, performed better for higher (normalized) values of
the peak stress as compared to lower values of the peak stress. These
comparisons showed that the proposed method is well-suited to predict the
characteristics of peak-stress clusters.

investigate from the system's thermodynamics to analyse intricate molecular
interactions. In general, to create extended molecular trajectories can be a
computationally expensive process, for example, when running $ab-initio$
simulations. Hence, repeating such calculations to either obtain more accurate
thermodynamics or to get a higher resolution in the dynamics generated by a
fine-grained quantum interaction can be time- and computationally-consuming. In
this work, we explore different machine learning (ML) methodologies to increase
the resolution of molecular dynamics trajectories on-demand within a
post-processing step. As a proof of concept, we analyse the performance of
bi-directional neural networks such as neural ODEs, Hamiltonian networks,
recurrent neural networks and LSTMs, as well as the uni-directional variants as
a reference, for molecular dynamics simulations (here: the MD17 dataset). We
have found that Bi-LSTMs are the best performing models; by utilizing the local
time-symmetry of thermostated trajectories they can even learn long-range
correlations and display high robustness to noisy dynamics across molecular
complexity. Our models can reach accuracies of up to 10$^{-4}$ angstroms in
trajectory interpolation, while faithfully reconstructing several full cycles
of unseen intricate high-frequency molecular vibrations, rendering the
comparison between the learned and reference trajectories indistinguishable.
The results reported in this work can serve (1) as a baseline for larger
systems, as well as (2) for the construction of better MD integrators.

The non-stationary nature of the EEG signals, coupled with the demanding task

noisy signal acquisition conditions, have motivated the work reported in this
study. The proposed adaptive template enhancement mechanism transforms the
feature-level instances by treating each feature dimension separately, hence
resulting in improved class separation and better query-class matching. The
proposed new instance-based learning algorithm is compared with a few related
algorithms in a number of scenarios. A clinical grade 64-electrode EEG
database, as well as a low-quality (high-noise level) EEG database obtained
with a low-cost system using a single dry sensor have been used for evaluations
in biometric person recognition. The proposed approach demonstrates
significantly improved classification accuracy in both identification and
verification scenarios. In particular, this new method is seen to provide a
good classification performance for noisy EEG data, indicating its potential
suitability for a wide range of applications.

to the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being

In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the
policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of
the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not
introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance,

therefore addressed. Given its complexity, which is known to be NP-hard, we
introduce a solution based on game theory. First, we argue that separating
between UAVs and UEs in terms of the assigned sub-carriers reduces the
interference impact on the users. This is materialized through a matching game.
Moreover, in order to boost the partition, we propose a coalitional game that
considers the outcome of the first one and enables users to change their

introduced, which is considered in the two games. Performance evaluations are

Networking (SDN) are the key enablers of the fifth generation of mobile
networks (5G). Service Function Chaining (SFC) plays a critical role in
delivering sophisticated service per slice and enables traffic traversal
through a set of ordered Service Functions (SFs). In fully symmetric SFCs, the
uplink and downlink traffic traverse the same SFs, while in asymmetric SFC, the
reverse-path may not necessarily cross the same SFs in the reverse order.
Proposed approaches in the literature support either full symmetry or no
symmetry. In this paper, we discuss the partial symmetry concept, that enforces
the reverse path to traverse the SFs only when needed. Our contribution is
threefold. First, we propose a novel SFC framework with an abstraction layer
that can dynamically create partial or full symmetric SFCs across multiple
administrative and technological cloud/edge domains. According to the Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) and desired objectives specified at the network
slice intent request, the abstraction layer would automatise different SFC
operations, but specifically generating partial or full symmetric SFCs. Second,
we propose an algorithm to dynamically calculate the reverse path for an SFC by
including only SFs requiring symmetry. Third, we implement a prototype
application to test the performance of the partial symmetry algorithm. The
obtained results show the advantages of partial symmetry in reducing both the
SFC delivery time and the load on VNFs.

physics is proposed to understand the deep neural networks (DNNs). It
characterizes the invariance of variance, where a biotic system explores
different pathways of evolution with equal probability in absence of feedback
signals, and complex functional structure emerges from quantitative
accumulation of adaptive-symmetries breaking in response to feedback signals.
Theoretically and experimentally, we characterize the optimization process of a
DNN system as an extended adaptive-symmetry-breaking process. One particular
finding is that a hierarchically large DNN would have a large reservoir of
adaptive symmetries, and when the information capacity of the reservoir exceeds
the complexity of the dataset, the system could absorb all perturbations of the
examples and self-organize into a functional structure of zero training errors
measured by a certain surrogate risk. More specifically, this process is
characterized by a statistical-mechanical model that could be appreciated as a
generalization of statistics physics to the DNN organized complex system, and
characterizes regularities in higher dimensionality. The model consists of
three constitutes that could be appreciated as the counterparts of Boltzmann
distribution, Ising model, and conservative symmetry, respectively: (1) a
stochastic definition/interpretation of DNNs that is a multilayer probabilistic
graphical model, (2) a formalism of circuits that perform biological
computation, (3) a circuit symmetry from which self-similarity between the
microscopic and the macroscopic adaptability manifests. The model is analyzed
with a method referred as the statistical assembly method that analyzes the
coarse-grained behaviors (over a symmetry group) of the heterogeneous

main idea of this article is that analytical solutions to problems of mechanics
of discrete periodic media can be obtained by a method of asymptotic inversion
of the Laplace and Fourier transforms in the vicinity of the quasi-front of
infinitely long waves; moreover, in this method it is possible to take into
account the contribution of short waves. Using this method, we obtain
asymptotics of perturbations in lattices in plane and antiplane formulations
under a local transient load. Besides, we show that equations describing 2D
plane motion of a square lattice can be represented in the form of two linearly
independent wave equations, each of which contains one unknown function only.
By analogy with the theory of elasticity, one equation describes the
propagation of shear waves in the lattice, while the other equation describes
the propagation of longitudinal waves. As a result, it is shown that, in a
homogeneous infinite lattice, a load can be specified in such a manner that
either predominantly longitudinal or predominantly shear waves are formed. The
problems under study are also solved by a finite difference method. The
qualitative and quantitative correspondence of asymptotic and numerical
solutions is shown.
