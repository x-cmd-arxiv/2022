singularly perturbed domains with small interior targets or traps (the narrow
capture problem). One major application is to intracellular diffusion, where
the targets typically represent some form of reactive biochemical substrate.
Most studies of the narrow capture problem treat the target boundaries as
totally absorbing. In this paper, we analyze the three-dimensional narrow
capture problem in the more realistic case of partially reactive target
boundaries. We begin by considering classical Robin boundary conditions.
Matching inner and outer solutions of the single-particle probability density,
we derive an asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transformed flux into each
reactive surface in powers of $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon \rho$ is a given
target size. In turn, the fluxes determine the splitting probabilities for
target absorption. We then extend our analysis to more general types of
reactive targets by combining matched asymptotic analysis with an
encounter-based formulation of diffusion-mediated surface reactions. That is,
we derive an asymptotic expansion of the joint probability density for particle
position and the boundary local time. The effects of surface reactions are then
incorporated via an appropriate stopping condition for the boundary local time.
Finally, we illustrate the theory by exploring how the leading-order
contributions to the splitting probabilities depend on the choice of surface
reactions. In particular, we show that there is an effective renormalization of
the target radius of the form $\rho\rightarrow \rho-\widetilde{\Psi}(1/\rho)$,
where $\widetilde{\Psi}$ is the Laplace transform of the stopping local time
distribution.

is fused to form the final part either by melting or by chemical binding with
subsequent sintering. In both cases, process stability and resulting part
quality depend on dynamic interactions between powder particles and a fluid
phase, i.e., molten metal or liquid binder. The present work proposes a
versatile computational modeling framework for simulating such coupled
microfluid-powder dynamics problems involving thermo-capillary flow and
reversible phase transitions. In particular, a liquid and a gas phase are
interacting with a solid phase that consists of a substrate and mobile powder
particles while simultaneously considering temperature-dependent surface
tension and wetting effects. In case of laser-metal interactions, the effect of
rapid evaporation is incorporated through additional mechanical and thermal
interface fluxes. All phase domains are spatially discretized using smoothed
particle hydrodynamics. The method's Lagrangian nature is beneficial in the
context of dynamically changing interface topologies. Special care is taken in
the formulation of phase transitions, which is crucial for the robustness of
the computational scheme. While the underlying model equations are of a very
general nature, the proposed framework is especially suitable for the mesoscale
modeling of various AM processes. To this end, the generality and robustness of
the computational modeling framework is demonstrated by several
application-motivated examples representing the specific AM processes binder
jetting, material jetting, directed energy deposition, and powder bed fusion.
Among others, it is shown how the dynamic impact of droplets in binder jetting
or the evaporation-induced recoil pressure in powder bed fusion leads to powder
motion, distortion of the powder packing structure, and powder particle
ejection.

Energy system models are able to provide insights into optimal investment
capacities and thus are widely used to aid the long-term investment
decision-making under an electricity market environment. Existing energy system
models, however, fail to consider bilateral electricity markets while in
reality, these constitute a major part of all energy trades. In this paper, we
propose an improved energy system model that endogenously considers mixed
bilateral and pool markets. In this model, we also introduce three externality
cost items that account for the social cost of technologies, carbon
taxes/renewable energy subsidies, and the bilateral product differentiation in
the bilateral market, respectively. We start with an equilibrium problem
formulation for different market players and next, an equivalent optimization
problem is presented. Then, a case study of the pan-European market to reach
95\% emission reduction in 2050 is conducted to demonstrate the model.
Different scenarios are constructed to showcase two different usages of product
differentiation in the bilateral market, i.e., willingness to pay and exogenous
costs. Our main conclusion is that the inclusion of mixed bilateral and pool
markets into our enriched energy system model significantly changed the optimal
investment capacities, compared to benchmark results from the existing,
conventional energy system model. This shows that the inclusion of the
bilateral market is of key importance in future investment considerations. Our
model is the first of its kind to include this important and realistic
bilateral market in energy system models.

a graphon with a nuclear-norm-type penalty, and give guarantees for the

matched control sample of non-active galaxies from the MaNGA survey in order to
characterise and estimate the extents of the Narrow Line Region (NLR) and of
the kinematically disturbed region (KDR) by the AGN. We define the observed NLR
radius as the farthest distance from the nucleus within which both
[Oiii]/H\beta and [Nii]/H\alpha ratios fall in the AGN region of the BPT
diagram and the H\alpha equivalent width is required to be larger than 3.0\AA.
The extent of the KDR is defined as the distance from the nucleus within which
the AGN hosts galaxies shows a more disturbed gas kinematics than the control
galaxies. The kinematics derived from the [Oiii] line profiles reveal that, on
average, the most luminous AGN (L[Oiii] > 3.8 * 10^40 erg s^-1) possess higher
residual difference between the gaseous and stellar velocities and velocities
dispersion than their control galaxies. Spatially resolved NLR's and KDR's were
found in 55 and 46 AGN host galaxies, with corrected radii 0.2 < r_KDR,c < 2.3
kpc and 0.4 < r_NLR,c < 10.1 kpc, with a relation between the two given by log
r_KDR,c = (0.53\pm0.12) log r_NLR,c + (1.07\pm0.22), respectively. The
extension of the KDR corresponds to about 30 per cent of that of the NLR.
Assuming that the KDR is due to an AGN outflow, we have estimated ionised gas
mass outflow rates that range between 10^-5 and \approx 1 Myr^-1, and kinetic
powers that range from 10^34 to 10^40 erg s^-1. Comparing the power of the AGN
ionised outflows with the AGN luminosities, they are always below the 0.05
L_AGN model threshold for having an important feedback effect on their
respective host galaxies. The mass outflow rates (and power) of our AGN sample
correlate with their luminosities, populating the lowest AGN luminosity range

diffusion in a pair of cells with gap-junction coupling. Gap junctions are
prevalent in most animal organs and tissues, providing a direct diffusion
pathway for both electrical and chemical communication between cells. Most
analytical models of gap junctions focus on the steady-state diffusive flux and
the associated effective diffusivity. Here we investigate the relaxation to
steady state in terms of the so-called local accumulation time. The latter is
commonly used to estimate the time to form a protein concentration gradient
during morphogenesis. The basic idea is to treat the fractional deviation from
the steady-state concentration as a cumulative distribution for the local
accumulation time. One of the useful features of the local accumulation time is
that it takes into account the fact that different spatial regions can relax at
different rates. We consider both static and dynamic gap junction models. The
former treats the gap junction as a resistive channel with effective
permeability $\mu$, whereas the latter represents the gap junction as a
stochastic gate that randomly switches between an open and closed state. The
local accumulation time is calculated by solving the diffusion equation in
Laplace space and then taking the small-$s$ limit. We show that the
accumulation time is a monotonically increasing function of spatial position,
with a jump discontinuity at the gap junction. This discontinuity vanishes in
the limit $\mu \rightarrow \infty$ for a static junction and $\beta \rightarrow
0$ for a stochastically-gated junction, where $\beta$ is the rate at which the
gate closes.
  Finally, our results are generalized to the case of a linear array of cells
with nearest neighbor gap junction coupling.

discussion of the symmetries of multi-flavor Fermi systems in arbitrary

$N_\mathrm{crit}$ of Thirring models in three dimensions. Only models with
flavor number below $N_\mathrm{crit}$ show a phase transition from a
symmetry-broken strong-coupling phase to a symmetric weak-coupling phase.
Recent simulations with chiral fermions show that $N_\mathrm{crit}$ is smaller
than previously extracted with various non-perturbative methods. Our
simulations with chiral SLAC fermions reveal that for four-component flavors
$N_\mathrm{crit}=0.80(4)$. This means that all reducible Thirring models with
$\Nr=1,2,3,\dots$ show no phase transition with order parameter. Instead we
discover footprints of phase transitions without order parameter. These new
transitions are probably smooth and could be used to relate the lattice
Thirring models to Thirring models in the continuum. For a single irreducible
flavor, we provide previously unpublished values for the critical couplings and
critical exponents.

outflows in classical novae are nonthermal emitters. Given the high densities
in these systems, radiative shocks are expected to form. However, in the
presence of high velocities, the formation of adiabatic shocks is also
possible. A case of interest is when the two types of shocks occur
simultaneously. These dense jets/outflows are excellent candidates for
laboratory experiments as demonstrated by MHD scaling. We aim at studying the
combination of adiabatic and radiative shocks in these systems. We focus on
determining the conditions under which this combination is feasible together
with its physical implications. We perform an analytical study of the shocks in
both types of sources for a set of parameters. The hydrodynamical evolution of
a jet colliding with an ambient medium is studied with 2D numerical simulations
confirming our initial theoretical estimates. We show that for a wide set of
parameters the combination of an adiabatic and a radiative shock is possible at
the working surface of the termination region in jets from young stars and
novae outflows. We find that instabilities are developed at the contact
discontinuity, mixing the shocked materials. Also, we explore the MHD parameter
scaling required for studying protostellar jets and novae outflows using
laboratory experiments on laser facilities. The coexistence of an adiabatic and
a radiative shock is expected at the termination region of protostellar jets
and novae outflows. This scenario is very promising for particle acceleration
and gamma-ray emission. The parameters for scaled laboratory experiments are
very much in line with plasma conditions achievable in currently operating
high-power laser facilities. This opens the door to new means for studying
novae outflows never considered before.

created by the collision of two inhomogeneous, asymmetric, weakly magnetised
laser-produced plasma jets can generate strong stochastic magnetic fields via
the small-scale turbulent dynamo mechanism, provided the magnetic Reynolds
number of the plasma is sufficiently large. In this paper, we compare such a
plasma with one arising from two pre-magnetised plasma jets whose creation is
identical save for the addition of a strong external magnetic field imposed by
a pulsed magnetic field generator (`MIFEDS'). We investigate the differences
between the two turbulent systems using a Thomson-scattering diagnostic, X-ray
self-emission imaging and proton radiography. The Thomson-scattering spectra
and X-ray images suggest that the presence of the external magnetic field has a
limited effect on the plasma dynamics in the experiment. While the presence of
the external magnetic field induces collimation of the flows in the colliding
plasma jets and the initial strengths of the magnetic fields arising from the
interaction between the colliding jets are significantly larger as a result of
the external field, the energy and morphology of the stochastic magnetic fields
post-amplification are indistinguishable. We conclude that, for turbulent
laser-plasmas with super-critical magnetic Reynolds numbers, the
dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are determined by the turbulent dynamics
rather than the seed fields and modest changes in the initial flow dynamics of
the plasma, a finding consistent with theoretical expectations and simulations
of turbulent dynamos.

transport package MCNP5 was first used to model a basic multilayer structure
under a Varian 6MV. It was then modified by the addition of Cu and Pb to
analyze the extent of the signal enhancement and changes in secondary electron
fluence spectra. Backscattering coefficients were then calculated using EGSnrc
for electron sources. Analytical functions were established to represent the
best-fitting curves to the simulation data. Finally, electron backscattering
data were related to signal enhancement. It was found that adding a metal film
below the sensitive volume of a detector increases the fraction of reflected
electrons, especially in the low energy range, resulting in ~10% and 75%
increased energy deposition using Cu and Pb, respectively. We also established
a linear dependence between the energy deposition in the semiconductor layer
and the fluence of backscattered electrons in the corresponding multilayer
structure. The low-Z top layer in practically implemental thicknesses of tens
of microns has a positive effect due to partial electron reflection back to the
semiconductor layer. Signal enhancement in a thin-film CdTe radiation detector
could be achieved using electron backscattering from metal reflectors. The
methodology explored here warrants further studies to quantify achievable
signal enhancement for various thin-film and other small sensitive volume
detectors.

performance on a variety of tasks. However, they are also computationally
expensive, which has motivated the development of model compression techniques
which reduce the resource consumption associated with deep learning models.
Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested that model compression can have an
adverse effect on algorithmic fairness, amplifying existing biases in machine
learning models. With this project we aim to extend those studies to the
context of facial expression recognition. To do that, we set up a neural
network classifier to perform facial expression recognition and implement
several model compression techniques on top of it. We then run experiments on
two facial expression datasets, namely the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+DB)
and the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), to examine the individual
and combined effect that compression techniques have on the model size,
accuracy and fairness. Our experimental results show that: (i) Compression and
quantisation achieve significant reduction in model size with minimal impact on
overall accuracy for both CK+DB and RAF-DB; (ii) in terms of model accuracy,
the classifier trained and tested on RAF-DB seems more robust to compression
compared to the CK+ DB; (iii) for RAF-DB, the different compression strategies
do not seem to increase the gap in predictive performance across the sensitive
attributes of gender, race and age which is in contrast with the results on the
CK+DB, where compression seems to amplify existing biases for gender. We
analyse the results and discuss the potential reasons for our findings.

many turbulent flows, due to computational efficiency. Machine learning is a
promising approach to improve the accuracy of RANS simulations. One major area
of improvement is using machine learning models to represent the complex
relationship between the mean flow field gradients and the Reynolds stress
tensor. In the present work, modifications to improve the stability of previous
optimal eddy viscosity approaches for RANS simulations are presented and
evaluated. The optimal eddy viscosity is reformulated with a non-negativity
constraint, which promotes numerical stability. We demonstrate that the new
formulation of the optimal eddy viscosity improves the conditioning of the RANS
equations for a periodic hills test case. To demonstrate the suitability of
this proportional/orthogonal tensor decomposition for use in a physics-informed
data-driven turbulence closure, we use two neural networks (structured on this
specific tensor decomposition which is incorporated as an inductive bias into
the network design) to predict the newly reformulated linear and non-linear
parts of the Reynolds stress tensor. Injecting these network model predictions
for the Reynolds stresses into a RANS simulation improves predictions of the
velocity field, even when compared to a sophisticated (state of the art)
physics-based turbulence closure model. Finally, we apply SHAP (SHapley

limit of gravitational deflection. After recent observations of the black hole

of the accreting matter of the black hole environment and can appear near the

disc around a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider thin disk given by the

determined by the position of the inner boundary of the accretion disk, which
makes it possible to use them to distinguish between different accretion

literature, by emulating target trials of treatment sequences to estimate
treatment effects in each line of therapy. Treatment effects estimates from the
target trials inform a bivariate network meta-analysis (NMA) of first and
second-line treatments. Results: Summary data were obtained from 21 trials of
biologic therapies including 2 for second-line treatment and results from six

decrease in uncertainty around the effectiveness estimates of the second-line
therapies, when compared to the results of univariate NMA, and allowed for

Bivariate NMA provides effectiveness estimates for all treatments in first- and

did not exist in the data. This novel methodology may have further

secular evolution of these three variables. The 2:1 MMR is used as example to
show some results. We found four apsidal corotation resonance (ACR) families,
two symmetric and two asymmetric. One of the symmetric families exists for
almost any $e_p$ value. The other one for $e_p>0.3$ and the asymmetric ones for
$e_p>0.44$. We corroborate the secular variations in $e$ and $\varpi$ predicted
by the model through numerical integrations even when the initial conditions
are displaced from those ACR. Some peculiar examples are presented for the 3:1
and 3:2 MMR showing large excursions in eccentricity. As an application, the
Planet 9 is investigated as a possible responsible of high eccentric distant
TNOs.

alternative, simple projectile geometries on the DART impact outcome we used
the iSALE shock physics code in two and thee-dimensions to model vertical
impacts of projectiles with a mass and speed equivalent to the nominal DART
impact, into porous basalt targets. We found that the simple projectile
geometries investigated here have minimal effects on the crater morphology and
momentum enhancement. Projectile geometries modelled in two-dimensions that
have similar surface areas at the point of impact, affect the crater radius and
the crater volume by less than 5%. In the case of a more extreme projectile
geometry (i.e., a rod, modelled in three-dimensions), the crater was elliptical
and 50% shallower compared to the crater produced by a spherical projectile of
the same momentum. The momentum enhancement factor in these test cases,
commonly referred to as beta, was within 7% for the 2D simulations and within
10% for the 3D simulations, of the value obtained for a uniform spherical
projectile. The most prominent effects of projectile geometry are seen in the
ejection velocity as a function of launch position and ejection angle of the
fast ejecta that resides in the so-called `coupling zone'. These results will

high challenges related to the widespread use of large flexible structures. The
development of new modeling tools which are able to account for the
multidisciplinary nature of this problem becomes extremely relevant in order to
meet both structure and control performance criteria. This paper proposes a
novel methodology to analytically model large truss structures in a
sub-structuring framework. A three dimensional unit cube element has been
designed and validated with a Finite Element commercial software. This model is
composed by multiple two-dimensional sub-mechanisms assembled using
block-diagram models. This constitutes the building block for constructing
complex truss structures by repetitions of the element. The accurate vibration
description of the system and its minimal representation, as well as the
possibility of accounting for parametric uncertainties in its mechanical
parameters, make it an appropriate tool to perform robust Structure/Control
co-design. In order to demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach, a
co-design study case is proposed by combining a multidisciplinary optimization
approach based on particle swarm algorithm and multiple structured robust
Hinf-synthesis. This has been used to optimize the pointing performances of an
high pointing antenna, minimizing the perturbations coming from the Solar Array
Mechanisms (SADM) of two solar panels, performing active control by means of
multiple proof mass actuators, and simultaneously reduce the mass of the
truss-structure which connects the antenna to the main spacecraft body.

that dendritic spines, small protrusions from the dendrites that receive input

morphological changes during drug exposure and withdrawal. Moreover, these
changes relate to the characteristic drug-seeking behavior of addiction.
However, due to the complexity of the dendritic spines, we do not yet fully
understand the processes underlying their structural changes in response to
different inputs. We propose that biophysical models can enhance the current

generate experimentally testable hypotheses. This review aims to give an

parameter estimation of quantum channels. We study the task of estimating
unknown parameters encoded in a channel in the sequential setting. A sequential
strategy is the most general way to use a channel multiple times. Our goal is
to establish lower bounds (called Cramer-Rao bounds) on the estimation error.
The bounds we develop are universally applicable; i.e., they apply to all
permissible quantum dynamics. We consider the use of catalysts to enhance the
power of a channel estimation strategy. This is termed amortization. The power
of a channel for a parameter estimation is determined by its Fisher
information. Thus, we study how much a catalyst quantum state can enhance the
Fisher information of a channel by defining the amortized Fisher information.
We establish our bounds by proving that for certain Fisher information
quantities, catalyst states do not improve the performance of a sequential
estimation protocol compared to a parallel one. The technical term for this is
an amortization collapse. We use this to establish bounds when estimating one
parameter, or multiple parameters simultaneously. Our bounds apply universally
and we also cast them as optimization problems. For the single parameter case,
we establish bounds for general quantum channels using both the symmetric
logarithmic derivative (SLD) Fisher information and the right logarithmic
derivative (RLD) Fisher information. The task of estimating multiple parameters
simultaneously is more involved than the single parameter case, because the
Cramer-Rao bounds take the form of matrix inequalities. We establish a scalar
Cramer-Rao bound for multiparameter channel estimation using the RLD Fisher
information. For both single and multiparameter estimation, we provide a no-go
condition for the so-called Heisenberg scaling using our RLD-based bound.

search trees should be defined in external memory. A defining characteristic of
external-memory data structures is that there is a stark asymmetry between
queries and inserts/updates/deletes: by making the former slightly
asymptotically slower, one can make the latter significantly asymptotically
faster (even allowing for operations with sub-constant amortized I/Os). This
asymmetry makes it so that rotation-based search trees are not optimal (or even
close to optimal) in insert/update/delete-heavy external-memory workloads. To
study dynamic optimality for such workloads, one must consider a different
class of data structures.
  The natural class of data structures to consider are what we call
buffered-propagation trees. Such trees can adapt dynamically to the locality
properties of an input sequence in order to optimize the interactions between
different inserts/updates/deletes and queries. We also present a new form of
beyond-worst-case analysis that allows for us to formally study a continuum
between static and dynamic optimality. Finally, we give a novel data structure,
called the \jellotree, that is statically optimal and that achieves dynamic
optimality for a large natural class of inputs defined by our beyond-worst-case
analysis.

Fine Selmer group is closely related to the 1st and 2nd Iwasawa cohomology
groups. Coates-Sujatha observed that the structure of the fine Selmer group of
$E$ over a $p$-adic Lie extension of a number field is intricately related to
some deep questions in classical Iwasawa theory; for example, Iwasawa's
classical $\mu$-invariant vanishing conjecture. In this article, we study the
properties of the $p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over
certain $p$-adic Lie extensions of a number field. We also define and discuss
$p^\infty$-fine Selmer group of an elliptic curve over function fields of
characteristic $p$ and also of characteristic $\ell \neq p.$ We relate our

studied and commercialized in the domains of touch sensing, localization,
existence detection, and contact sensing interface application such as
human-computer interaction. However, as a non-contact proximity sensing scheme
is easily affected by the disturbance of peripheral objects or surroundings, it
requires considerable sensitive data processing than contact sensing, limiting
the use of its further utilization. In this paper, we propose a real-time
interface control framework based on non-contact hand motion gesture
recognition through processing the raw signals, detecting the electric field
disturbance triggered by the hand gesture movements near the capacitive sensor
using adaptive threshold, and extracting the significant signal frame, covering
the authentic signal intervals with 98.8% detection rate and 98.4% frame
correction rate. Through the GRU model trained with the extracted signal frame,
we classify the 10 hand motion gesture types with 98.79% accuracy. The
framework transmits the classification result and maneuvers the interface of
the foreground process depending on the input. This study suggests the
feasibility of intuitive interface technology, which accommodates the flexible
interaction between human to machine similar to Natural User Interface, and
uplifts the possibility of commercialization based on measuring the electric

a randomly generated polytropic EoS. The reconstructed EoS fits the mock data
with reasonable accuracy, using just 11 mock M-R pairs observations, close to

  Our main findings are that women represent only about 10% of systems

with a self-excited thermoacoustic instability in the combustor, we find that a
progressive increase in the swirler rotation rate transitions the system from
thermoacoustic instability to the suppressed state through a state of
intermittency. To model such transition while also quantifying the underlying
synchronization characteristics, we extend the model of Dutta et al. [Phys.
Rev. E 99, 032215 (2019)] by introducing a feedback between the ensemble of
mean-field phase oscillators and the basis expansion of the acoustic pressure
governing equation. The assumption that coupling strength among the oscillators
is a linear combination of acoustic and swirler rotation frequency is justified
\textit{a posteriori}. The link between the model and experimental results is
quantitatively established by implementing an optimization algorithm for model
parameter estimation. We show that the model replicates the bifurcation
characteristics, time series, probability density function (PDF), and power
spectral density (PSD) of the various dynamical states observed during the
transition to the suppressed state, to excellent accuracy. Specifically, the
model captures the change in the PDF of pressure and heat release rate
fluctuations from a bimodal distribution during thermoacoustic instability to a
unimodal distribution during suppression. Finally, we discuss the global and

flow will rock systematically between red and blue shifted during each QPO
cycle. Here we conduct phase-resolved spectroscopy of a $\sim2.2$ Hz type-C QPO
from the BH X-ray binary GRS 1915+105, observed simultaneously with NICER and
NuSTAR. We apply a tomographic model in order to constrain the QPO
phase-dependent illumination profile of the disc. We detect the predicted QPO
phase-dependent shifts of the iron line centroid energy, with our best fit
featuring an asymmetric illumination profile ($>2{\sigma}$ confidence). The
observed line energy shifts can alternatively be explained by the spiral
density waves of the accretion-ejection instability model. However we
additionally measure a significant ($>3{\sigma}$) modulation in reflection
fraction, strongly favouring a geometric QPO origin. We infer that the disc is
misaligned with previously observed jet ejections, which is consistent with the
model of a truncated disc with an inner precessing hot flow. However our
inferred disc inner radius is small ($r_\text{in}{\sim} 1.4 GM/c^2$). For this
disc inner radius, Lense-Thirring precession cannot reproduce the observed QPO
frequency. In fact, this disc inner radius is incompatible with the predictions
of all well-studied QPO models in the literature.

characterize image structure, and we will elaborate on how to construct cost
function to capture high level feature to enhance the model performance.
Another dimension is searching for the more appropriate neural architecture,
which is a subset of an even bigger picture, the automatic machine learning, or
AutoML. There are several famous networks, U-net, ResNet (He et al., 2016) and
DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), and they achieve phenomenal results for certain
problems, yet it's hard to argue they are the best for inversion problems
without thoroughly searching within certain space. Here we will be showing our

engender novel quantum phases and lead to interesting collective phenomena. In
Ref. 1, the authors described a general dynamical decoupling (polyfractal)
protocol that can be used to engineer multiple discrete symmetries in many-body
systems. The present work expands on the former by studying the effect of
quasiperiodic and random noise on such a dynamical scheme. We find generally
that relaxation of engineered symmetry generators proceeds by i) an initial
relaxation on microscopic timescales to a prethermal plateau whose height is
independent of noise, ii) a linear relaxation regime with a noise-dependent
rate, followed by iii) a slow logarithmic relaxation regime that is only
present for quasiperiodic noise. We glean the essential features of these
regimes via scaling collapses and show that they can be generally explained by
the spectral properties of the various noise waveforms considered. In
particular, the quasiperiodic noise is characterised by highly time dependent
spectrum with a noise floor that mimics white noise, and peaks that grow
sharper with time. We argue that both the noise floor and peaks contribute to
the initial linear-in-time relaxation while the logarithmic regime is initiated
when the peaks become sufficiently well resolved and cease to contribute to
further relaxation. We provide numerical evidence to justify these findings.

parameters labelled by $G$ and $\Lambda$. As a consequence, correlation
functions of the boundary stress tensor in AdS$_3$ are uniquely fixed in terms
of one dimensionless parameter, which is the central charge of the Virasoro
algebra. The same argument implies that AdS$_3$ gravity at a finite radial
cutoff is a renormalizable theory, but now with one additional parameter
corresponding to the cutoff location. This theory is conjecturally dual to a
$T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT, assuming that such theories actually exist. To
elucidate this, we study the quantum theory of boundary gravitons living on a
cutoff planar boundary and the associated correlation functions of the boundary
stress tensor. We compute stress tensor correlation functions to two-loop order
($G$ being the loop counting parameter), extending existing tree level results.
This is made feasible by the fact that the boundary graviton action simplifies
greatly upon making a judicious field redefinition, turning into the Nambu-Goto
action. After imposing Lorentz invariance, the correlators at this order are
found to be unambiguous up to a single undetermined renormalization parameter.

stars eventually ejects the gas, terminating star formation and leaving behind
one or more star clusters. Using the STARFORGE simulations, it is possible to
simulate this process in its entirety within a molecular cloud, while
explicitly evolving the gas radiation and magnetic fields and following the
formation of individual, low-mass stars. We find that individual star-formation
sites merge to form ever larger structures, while still accreting gas. Thus
clusters are assembled through a series of mergers. During the cluster assembly
process a small fraction of stars are ejected from their clusters; we find no
significant difference between the mass distribution of the ejected stellar
population and that of stars inside clusters. The star-formation sites that are
the building blocks of clusters start out mass segregated with one or a few
massive stars at their center. As they merge the newly formed clusters maintain
this feature, causing them to have mass-segregated substructures without
themselves being centrally condensed. The merged clusters relax to a centrally
condensed mass segregated configuration through dynamical interactions between
their members, but this process does not finish before feedback expels the
remaining gas from the cluster. In the simulated runs the gas-free clusters
then become unbound and break up. We find that turbulent driving and a periodic
cloud geometry can significantly reduce clustering and prevent gas expulsion.
Meanwhile, the initial surface density and level of turbulence have little
qualitative effect on cluster evolution, despite the significantly different
star formation histories.

the most accurate CNN models correctly classified some image responses that had

outline a method to select human rated responses for the training sample based
on an application of the expected response function derived from item response

irrelevant, depending on the range of the qubit-light coupling, then the
optimal subsystem can be either light or the qubit. In other scenarios, e.g.,
simultaneous estimation of the couplings, the light is usually the optimal
subsystem. This can be explained as light is the mediator between the other two
subsystems. Finally, we show that the widely used homodyne detection can

star formation. Compared with the classic blue-skewed profiles, redshifted
absorption against continuum emission is a more reliable method to detect
inward motions within high-mass star formation regions. We aim to test if
methanol transitions can be used to trace infall motions within high-mass star
formation regions. Using the Effelsberg-100 m, IRAM-30 m, and APEX-12 m
telescopes, we carried out observations of 37 and 16 methanol transitions
towards two well-known collapsing dense clumps, W31C (G10.6-0.4) and W3(OH), to
search for redshifted absorption features or inverse P-Cygni profiles.
Redshifted absorption is observed in 14 and 11 methanol transitions towards
W31C and W3(OH), respectively. The infall velocities fitted from a simple
two-layer model agree with previously reported values derived from other
tracers, suggesting that redshifted methanol absorption is a reliable tracer of
infall motions within high-mass star formation regions. Our observations
indicate the presence of large-scale inward motions, and the mass infall rates
are roughly estimated to be $\gtrsim$10$^{-3}$ $M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which
supports the global hierarchical collapse and clump-fed scenario. With the aid
of bright continuum sources and the overcooling of methanol transitions leading
to enhanced absorption, redshifted methanol absorption can trace infall motions
within high-mass star formation regions hosting bright H{\scriptsize II}
regions.

from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Traditionally,
subspace-based methods form an important class of solutions to this problem.
Despite their mathematical elegance and tractability, these methods are often
found to be ineffective at producing domain-invariant features with complex,
real-world datasets. Motivated by the recent advances in representation
learning with deep networks, this paper revisits the use of subspace alignment
for UDA and proposes a novel adaptation algorithm that consistently leads to
improved generalization. In contrast to existing adversarial training-based DA
methods, our approach isolates feature learning and distribution alignment
steps, and utilizes a primary-auxiliary optimization strategy to effectively
balance the objectives of domain invariance and model fidelity. While providing
a significant reduction in target data and computational requirements, our
subspace-based DA performs competitively and sometimes even outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on several standard UDA benchmarks. Furthermore,
subspace alignment leads to intrinsically well-regularized models that
demonstrate strong generalization even in the challenging partial DA setting.
Finally, the design of our UDA framework inherently supports progressive
adaptation to new target domains at test-time, without requiring retraining of
the model from scratch. In summary, powered by powerful feature learners and an
effective optimization strategy, we establish subspace-based DA as a highly
effective approach for visual recognition.

simulation. Current trace-driven simulators assume that the interventions being
simulated (e.g., a new algorithm) would not affect the validity of the traces.
However, real-world traces are often biased by the choices algorithms make
during trace collection, and hence replaying traces under an intervention may
lead to incorrect results. CausalSim addresses this challenge by learning a
causal model of the system dynamics and latent factors capturing the underlying
system conditions during trace collection. It learns these models using an
initial randomized control trial (RCT) under a fixed set of algorithms, and
then applies them to remove biases from trace data when simulating new
algorithms.
  Key to CausalSim is mapping unbiased trace-driven simulation to a tensor
completion problem with extremely sparse observations. By exploiting a basic
distributional invariance property present in RCT data, CausalSim enables a
novel tensor completion method despite the sparsity of observations. Our
extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic datasets,
including more than ten months of real data from the Puffer video streaming
system shows it improves simulation accuracy, reducing errors by 53% and 61% on
average compared to expert-designed and supervised learning baselines.
Moreover, CausalSim provides markedly different insights about ABR algorithms

deployment.

representation of density operators and observables. The role of the
corresponding classical reflections is known in the construction of
semiclassical approximations to Wigner functions of pure eigenstates and their
coarsegrained microcanonical superpositions, which are not restricted to
classically integrable systems. In their active role as unitary operators, they
generate transitions between pairs of eigenstates specified by transition
Wigner functions (or cross-Wigner functions): The square modulus of the
transition Wigner function at each point in phase space is the transition
probability for the reflection through that point.
  Coarsegraining the initial and final energies provides a transition
probability density as a phase space path integral. It is here investigated in
the simplest classical approximation involving microcanonical Wigner functions.
A reflection operator generates a transition between a pair of energy shells
with a probability density given by the integral of the inverse modulus of a
Poisson bracket over the intersection of a shell with the reflection of its

absorption column in a post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) plant. It has been
demonstrated in our previous work how economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC)
has a great potential to improve the operation of the PCC plant. However, the
use of a general economic objective such as maximizing the absorption
efficiency of the column can cause EMPC to drive the state of the system close
to the constraints. This may often than not lead to solvent overcirculation and
flooding which are undesirable. In this work, we present an EMPC with zone
tracking algorithm as an effective means to address this problem. The proposed
control algorithm incorporates a zone tracking objective and an economic
objective to form a multi-objective optimal control problem. To ensure that the
zone tracking objective is achieved in the presence of model uncertainties and
time-varying flue gas flow rate, we propose a method to modify the original
target zone with a control invariant set. The zone modification method combines
both ellipsoidal control invariant set techniques and a back-off strategy. The
use of ellipsoidal control invariant sets ensure that the method is applicable
to large scale systems such as the absorption column. We present several
simulation case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of
the proposed control algorithm to the absorption column in a post-combustion

value of a meta-analysis to improve decision-making processes related to
nutrition in the poultry industry. To this end, nine commercial size
experiments were conducted to test the effect of a phytogenic feed additive and
three approaches were applied to the data. Materials and Methods: In all
experiments, 1-day-old male Cobb 500 chicks were used and fed corn-soybean meal
diets. Two dietary treatments were tested: T1, control diet and T2, control
diet + feed additive at a 0.05% inclusion rate. The experimental units were
broiler houses (7 experiments), floor pens (1 experiment) and cages (1
experiment). The response variables were final body weight, feed intake, feed
conversion ratio, mortality and production efficiency. Analyses of variance of
data from each and all the experiments were performed using SAS under
completely randomized non-blocked or blocked designs, respectively. The
meta-analyses were performed in R programming language. Results: No
statistically significant effects were found in the evaluated variables in any
of the independent experiments (p>0.12), nor following the application of a
block design (p>0.08). The meta-analyses showed no statistically significant
global effects in terms of final body weight (p>0.19), feed intake (p>0.23),

a positive global effect was found with respect to feed conversion ratio

additive improved the efficiency of birds to convert feed to body weight (35 g
less feed per 1 kg of body weight obtained). Thus, the use of meta-analyses in
commercial-scale poultry trials can increase statistical power and as a result,

Paintings have high visual complexities, but it is also difficult to collect

limitations, we introduce a novel mechanism, called proxy learning, which
learns visual concepts in paintings though their general relation to styles.
This framework does not require any visual annotation, but only uses style
labels and a general relationship between visual concepts and style. In this
paper, we propose a novel proxy model and reformulate four pre-existing methods
in the context of proxy learning. Through quantitative and qualitative
comparison, we evaluate these methods and compare their effectiveness in
quantifying the artistic visual concepts, where the general relationship is
estimated by language models; GloVe or BERT. The language modeling is a
practical and scalable solution requiring no labeling, but it is inevitably
imperfect. We demonstrate how the new proxy model is robust to the
imperfection, while the other models are sensitively affected by it.

for dark matter particles in the laboratory, and for constraining the local
shape of the Milky Way's dark matter halo. Estimates to date have typically
assumed that the Milky Way's stellar disc is axisymmetric and in a
steady-state. Yet the Milky Way disc is neither, exhibiting prominent spiral
arms and a bar, and vertical and radial oscillations. We assess the impact of
these assumptions on determinations of the local dark matter density by
applying a free-form, steady-state, Jeans method to two different N-body
simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies. In one, the galaxy has experienced an
ancient major merger, similar to the hypothesized Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus; in
the other, the galaxy is perturbed more recently by the repeated passage and
slow merger of a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy. We assess the impact of each of
the terms in the Jeans-Poisson equations on our ability to correctly extract
the local dark matter density from the simulated data. We find that common
approximations employed in the literature - axisymmetry and a locally flat
rotation curve - can lead to significant systematic errors of up to a factor
~1.5 in the recovered surface mass density ~2kpc above the disc plane, implying
a fractional error on the local dark matter density of order unity. However,
once we add in the tilt term and the rotation curve term in our models, we
obtain an unbiased estimate, consistent with the true value within our 95%
confidence intervals for realistic 20% uncertainties on the baryonic surface
density of the disc. Other terms - the axial tilt, 2:nd Poisson and time
dependent terms - contribute less than 10% to the local dark matter density
(given current data) and can be safely neglected for now. In the future, as
more data become available, these terms will need to be included in the
analysis.

sample is available at training time. To address this issue, one can rely on a
semantic description of each class. A typical ZSL model learns a mapping
between the visual samples of seen classes and the corresponding semantic
descriptions, in order to do the same on unseen classes at test time. State of
the art approaches rely on generative models that synthesize visual features
from the prototype of a class, such that a classifier can then be learned in a
supervised manner. However, these approaches are usually biased towards seen
classes whose visual instances are the only one that can be matched to a given
class prototype. We propose a regularization method that can be applied to any
conditional generative-based ZSL method, by leveraging only the semantic class
prototypes. It learns to synthesize discriminative features for possible

study the problem of testing whether an unknown state $|\psi\rangle$ is a
matrix product state (MPS) in the property testing model. MPS are a class of
physically-relevant quantum states which arise in the study of quantum
many-body systems. A quantum state $|\psi_{1,...,n}\rangle$ comprised of $n$
qudits is said to be an MPS of bond dimension $r$ if the reduced density matrix
$\psi_{1,...,k}$ has rank $r$ for each $k \in \{1,...,n\}$. When $r=1$, this
corresponds to the set of product states. For larger values of $r$, this yields
a more expressive class of quantum states, which are allowed to possess limited
amounts of entanglement. In the property testing model, one is given $m$
identical copies of $|\psi\rangle$, and the goal is to determine whether
$|\psi\rangle$ is an MPS of bond dimension $r$ or whether $|\psi\rangle$ is far
from all such states. For the case of product states, we study the product
test, a simple two-copy test previously analyzed by Harrow and Montanaro (FOCS
2010), and a key ingredient in their proof that
$\mathsf{QMA(2)}=\mathsf{QMA}(k)$ for $k \geq 2$. We give a new and simpler
analysis of the product test which achieves an optimal bound for a wide range
of parameters, answering open problems of Harrow and Montanaro (FOCS 2010) and
Montanaro and de Wolf (2016). For the case of $r\geq 2$, we give an efficient
algorithm for testing whether $|\psi\rangle$ is an MPS of bond dimension $r$
using $m = O(n r^2)$ copies, independent of the dimensions of the qudits, and
we show that $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ copies are necessary for this task. This lower
bound shows that a dependence on the number of qudits $n$ is necessary, in
sharp contrast to the case of product states where a constant number of copies
suffices.

their controller gains around the optimal steady state are evaluated by
calculating the sensitivities of corresponding constrained dynamic programming

integrating the objective functions and the probability density functions.
Moreover, boundary moving (i.e., back off) and target moving can be

  (CVPR), 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.CG cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Implicit neural networks have been successfully used for surface
reconstruction from point clouds. However, many of them face scalability issues
as they encode the isosurface function of a whole object or scene into a single
latent vector. To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent
vectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to
answer occupancy queries. In doing so, they loose the direct connection with
the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information
uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the
surface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization
tuning. To address these issues, we propose to use point cloud convolutions and
compute latent vectors at each input point. We then perform a learning-based
interpolation on nearest neighbors using inferred weights. Experiments on both
object and scene datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms
other methods on most classical metrics, producing finer details and better
reconstructing thinner volumes. The code is available at

disease that leads to lesions in the central nervous system. This disease can
be tracked and diagnosed using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Up to now a
multitude of multimodality automatic biomedical approaches is used to segment
lesions which are not beneficial for patients in terms of cost, time, and
usability. The authors of the present paper propose a method employing just one
modality (FLAIR image) to segment MS lesions accurately. Methods: A patch-based
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed, inspired by 3D-ResNet and
spatial-channel attention module, to segment MS lesions. The proposed method
consists of three stages: (1) the contrast-limited adaptive histogram
equalization (CLAHE) is applied to the original images and concatenated to the
extracted edges in order to create 4D images; (2) the patches of size 80 * 80 *
80 * 2 are randomly selected from the 4D images; and (3) the extracted patches
are passed into an attention-based CNN which is used to segment the lesions.
Finally, the proposed method was compared to previous studies of the same
dataset. Results: The current study evaluates the model, with a test set of
ISIB challenge data. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach
significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of Dice similarity and
Absolute Volume Difference while the proposed method use just one modality
(FLAIR) to segment the lesions. Conclusions: The authors have introduced an
automated approach to segment the lesions which is based on, at most, two
modalities as an input. The proposed architecture is composed of convolution,
deconvolution, and an SCA-VoxRes module as an attention module. The results
show, the proposed method outperforms well compare to other methods.

This work considers the most powerful software-based side-channel attackers,
i.e., an All Digital State Observing (ADSO) adversary who can observe all
digital states, including all digital states in secure enclaves. Traditional
signature schemes are not secure in ADSO adversarial model. We introduce a new
cryptographic primitive called One-Time Signature with Secret Key Exposure

attestation reports securely under the ADSO adversary. We also minimize the
trusted computing base by introducing a secure co-processor into the system,
and the interaction between the secure co-processor and the attestation
processor is unidirectional. That is, the co-processor takes no inputs from the

  Segmentation Models for Autonomous Driving",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The existence of real-world adversarial examples (commonly in the form of
patches) poses a serious threat for the use of deep learning models in
safety-critical computer vision tasks such as visual perception in autonomous
driving. This paper presents an extensive evaluation of the robustness of
semantic segmentation models when attacked with different types of adversarial
patches, including digital, simulated, and physical ones. A novel loss function
is proposed to improve the capabilities of attackers in inducing a
misclassification of pixels. Also, a novel attack strategy is presented to
improve the Expectation Over Transformation method for placing a patch in the
scene. Finally, a state-of-the-art method for detecting adversarial patch is
first extended to cope with semantic segmentation models, then improved to
obtain real-time performance, and eventually evaluated in real-world scenarios.
Experimental results reveal that, even though the adversarial effect is visible
with both digital and real-world attacks, its impact is often spatially
confined to areas of the image around the patch. This opens to further
questions about the spatial robustness of real-time semantic segmentation
models.

strategies for understanding its control have typically relied on either
model-based methods or linearizations thereof. Here we develop a framework that
combines model predictive control on an established flight dynamics model and
deep neural networks (DNN) to create an efficient method for solving the
inverse problem of flight control. We turn to natural systems for inspiration
since they inherently demonstrate network pruning with the consequence of
yielding more efficient networks for a specific set of tasks. This bio-inspired
approach allows us to leverage network pruning to optimally sparsify a DNN
architecture in order to perform flight tasks with as few neural connections as
possible, however, there are limits to sparsification. Specifically, as the
number of connections falls below a critical threshold, flight performance
drops considerably. We develop sparsification paradigms and explore their
limits for control tasks. Monte Carlo simulations also quantify the statistical
distribution of network weights during pruning given initial random weights of
the DNNs. We demonstrate that on average, the network can be pruned to retain
approximately 7% of the original network weights, with statistical
distributions quantified at each layer of the network. Overall, this work shows
that sparsely connected DNNs are capable of predicting the forces required to
follow flight trajectories. Additionally, sparsification has sharp performance
limits.

out-of-distribution with respect to the existing basis models and to
instantiate new models as needed. We test our approach in multiple domains and
show that it attains better prediction error than existing methods in most

we analyze the latent task representations learned by MoB and show that similar

reconstructed images of the cask contents indicated the ability of our system
to detect irregular baskets, such as empty baskets, with a CNR value of

For equilibrium models, the minor solenoidal part of the magnetic force is
balanced by a weak elastic force because the irrotational part is balanced by
the dominant gravity and pressure forces. Therefore, a strong magnetic field
may be confined in the interior, regardless of poloidal or toroidal components.
We numerically calculated axially symmetric models with the maximum
shear--strain, and found that a magnetic energy $> 10^{46}$ erg can be stored

The magnetic energy much exceeds the elastic energy ($ 10^{44} -10^{45}$ erg).
The shear--stress spatial distribution revealed that the elastic structure is
likely to break down near the surface. In particular, the critical position is

limited to fully exploit the time-lapse data. The main cause is that, in terms
of network architectures, they could not capture long-term rain streak
information in the time-lapse data during training owing to the lack of memory
components. To address this problem, we propose a novel network architecture
based on a memory network that explicitly helps to capture long-term rain

encoder-decoder networks and a memory network. The features extracted from the
encoder are read and updated in the memory network that contains several memory
items to store rain streak-aware feature representations. With the read/update
operation, the memory network retrieves relevant memory items in terms of the
queries, enabling the memory items to represent the various rain streaks
included in the time-lapse data. To boost the discriminative power of memory
features, we also present a novel background selective whitening (BSW) loss for
capturing only rain streak information in the memory network by erasing the

G014.645--00.606 is adjacent to three radio-quiet WISE HII region candidates.
The ionizing sources of the radio-quiet HII regions are expected to later than
B1V, given the sensitivity about 1-2 mJy of the MAGPIS 20 cm survey. The stars
were first selected if their parallaxes of GAIA EDR3 match that of the 22 GHz
H$_2$O maser source within the same region. We used the color-magnitude diagram
made from the ZTF photometric catalog to select the candidates for massive
stars because the intrinsic $g-r$ colors of massive stars change little from
B-type to O-type stars. Five stars lie in the areas of the color-magnitude
diagram where either reddened massive stars or evolved post-main sequence stars
of lower masses are commonly found. Three of the five stars, sources 1, 2, and
3, are located at the cavities of the three IR bubbles, and extended H$\alpha$
emission is detected around the three IR bubbles. We suggest that sources 1, 2,
and 3 are candidates for early-B stars associated with the radio-quiet region
G014.645--00.606. Particularly, source 1 is an EW type eclipsing binary with a
short period of 0.825 day, while source 2 is an EA type eclipsing binary with a
short period of 0.919 day. The physical parameters of the two binary systems
have been derived through the PHOEBE model. Source 1 is a twin binary of two
stars with T~23,500 K, and source 2 contains a hotter component (T~20,100 K)
and a cooler one (T~15,500 K). The $O-C$ values of source 1 show a trend of
decline, implying that the period of the source is deceasing. Source 1 is
likely a contacting early-B twin binary, for which mass transfer might cause
its orbit to shrink.

$query$ element on the blurry reference frame, FGSW-MSA enjoys the guidance of
the estimated optical flow to globally sample spatially sparse yet highly
related $key$ elements corresponding to the same scene patch in neighboring
frames. Besides, we present a Recurrent Embedding (RE) mechanism to transfer
information from past frames and strengthen long-range temporal dependencies.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed FGST outperforms

more visually pleasing results in real video deblurring. Code and pre-trained

becoming an important load in the building. Considering the mobility of EVs
from building to building and their uncertain charging demand, it is of great
practical interest to control the EV charging process in a microgrid of
buildings to optimize the total operation cost while ensuring the transmission
safety between the microgrid and the main grid. We consider this important
problem in this paper and make the following contributions. First, we formulate
this problem as a Markov decision process to capture the uncertain supply and
EV charging demand in the microgrid of buildings. Besides reducing the total
operation cost of buildings, the model also considers the power exchange
limitation to ensure transmission safety. Second, this model is reformulated
under event-based optimization framework to alleviate the impact of large state
and action space. By appropriately defining the event and event-based action,
the EV charging process can be optimized by searching a randomized parametric
event-based control policy in the microgrid controller and implementing a
selecting-to-charging rule in each building controller. Third, a constrained
gradient-based policy optimzation method with adjusting mechanism is proposed
to iteratively find the optimal event-based control policy for EV charging
demand in each building. Numerical experiments considering a microgrid of three
buildings are conducted to analyze the structure and the performance of the
event-based control policy for EV charging.

networks, one anomalous physical node (PN) or physical link (PL) in substrate
networks that carries multiple virtual network elements can cause significant
performance degradation of multiple network slices. To recover the substrate
networks from anomaly within a short time, rapid and accurate identification of
whether or not the anomaly exists in PNs and PLs is vital. Online anomaly
detection methods that can analyze system data in real-time are preferred.
Besides, as virtual nodes and links mapped to PNs and PLs are scattered in
multiple slices, the distributed detection modes are required to adapt to the
virtualized environment. According to those requirements, in this paper, we
first propose a distributed online PN anomaly detection algorithm based on a
decentralized one-class support vector machine (OCSVM), which is realized
through analyzing real-time measurements of virtual nodes mapped to PNs in a
distributed manner. Specifically, to decouple the OCSVM objective function, we
transform the original problem to a group of decentralized quadratic
programming problems by introducing the consensus constraints. The alternating
direction method of multipliers is adopted to achieve the solution for the
distributed online PN anomaly detection. Next, by utilizing the correlation of
measurements between neighbor virtual nodes, another distributed online PL
anomaly detection algorithm based on the canonical correlation analysis is
proposed. The network only needs to store covariance matrices and mean vectors
of current data to calculate the canonical correlation vectors for real-time PL
anomaly analysis. The simulation results on both synthetic and real-world

also practically relevant in the context of near-term quantum devices, is to
understand the computational power of hybrid models, that combine poly-time
classical computation with short-depth quantum computation. Here, we consider
two such models: CQ_d which captures the scenario of a polynomial-time
classical algorithm that queries a d-depth quantum computer many times; and
QC_d which is more analogous to measurement-based quantum computation and
captures the scenario of a d-depth quantum computer with the ability to change
the sequence of gates being applied depending on measurement outcomes processed
by a classical computation. Chia, Chung & Lai (STOC 2020) and Coudron & Menda
(STOC 2020) showed that these models (with d=log^O(1) (n)) are strictly weaker
than BQP (the class of problems solvable by poly-time quantum computation),
relative to an oracle, disproving a conjecture of Jozsa in the relativised
world. We show that, despite the similarities between CQ_d and QC_d, the two
models are incomparable, i.e. CQ_d $\nsubseteq$ QC_d and QC_d $\nsubseteq$ CQ_d
relative to an oracle. In other words, there exist problems that one model can
solve but not the other and vice versa. We do this by considering new oracle
problems that capture the distinctions between the two models and by
introducing the notion of an intrinsically stochastic oracle, an oracle whose
responses are inherently randomised, which is used for our second result. While
we leave showing the second separation relative to a standard oracle as an open
problem, we believe the notion of stochastic oracles could be of independent
interest for studying complexity classes which have resisted separation in the
standard oracle model. Our constructions also yield simpler oracle separations
between the hybrid models and BQP, compared to earlier works.

critical health issues for astronauts in space, are modulated by solar activity
with their intensity lagging behind the sunspot number (SSN) variation by about
one year. Previously, this lag has been attributed to a combined effect of
outward convecting solar wind and inward propagating GCRs. However, the lag's
amplitude and its solar-cycle dependence are still not fully understood (Ross &
Chaplin, 2019). By investigating the solar surface magnetic field, we find that
the source of heliospheric magnetic field -- the open magnetic flux on the Sun,
already lags behind SSN before it convects into heliosphere along with the
solar wind. The delay during odd cycles is longer than that during sequential
even cycles. Thus, we propose that the GCR lag is primarily due to the greatly
late opening of the solar magnetic field with respect to SSN, though solar wind
convection and particle transport in the heliosphere also matter. We further
investigate the origin of the open flux from different latitudes of the Sun and
found that the total open flux is significantly contributed by that from low
latitudes where coronal mass ejections frequently occur and also show an
odd-even cyclic pattern. Our findings challenge existing theories, and may
serve as the physical basis of long-term forecasts radiation dose estimates for

practical applications where the system is a black-box and cannot be accurately

black-box systems suffer from lack of safety guarantees and low sampling

without requiring for an accurate system model. Our method re-designs the loss
function to back-propagate gradient to the control policy even when the
black-box dynamical system is non-differentiable, and we show that the safety
certificates hold on the black-box system. Empirical results in simulation show
that our method can significantly improve the performance of the learned

fewer training samples, compared to state-of-the-art black-box safe control

Fermionic and Bosonic fields in the arena of discrete phase space and
continuous time. The mathematical formulation involves partial difference
equations. The corresponding Feynman diagrams and a new $S^{\#}$-matrix theory
is developed. In the special case of proton-proton Moller scattering via an
exchange of a neutral meson, the explicit second order element $\langle f |
S^{\#}_{(2)} |i \rangle$ is deduced. In the approximation of very low external
three-momenta, a new Yukawa potential is explicitly derived from $\langle f |
S^{\#}_{(2)} |i \rangle$. Moreover, it is rigorously proved that this new
Yukawa potential is divergence-free. The mass parameter of the exchanged meson
may be set to zero to obtain a type of scalar Boson exchange between
hypothetical Fermions. This provides a limiting case of a new Coulomb type
potential directly from the new singularity free Yukawa potential. A
divergence-free Coulomb potential between two Fermions at two discrete points
is shown to be proportional to the Euler beta function. Within this
relativistic discrete phase space continuous time, a single quanta is shown to
occupy the hyper-tori $S^{1}_{n^1} \times S^{1}_{n^3} \times S^{1}_{n^3}$ where
$S^{1}_{n}$ is a circle of radius $\sqrt{2n+1}$.

both simple and satisfying from a philosophical point of view: things do not
change along time, but they do change and the measurement of such changes is
what we call time. This deprives time of any attribute of substantiality,
meanwhile depriving it of all problems in defining the properties of time as a
substance. With the rise of Classical Mechanics, Aristotle's view is abandoned
and Newton's concept of ""true"" and absolute time imposes itself; time flows
independently on changes of any kind. Relativity will then radically modify our
concept of time, but won't actually modify the fundamental idea: things keep
changing along time -- changes do not make time. This work will argue
Aristotle's thesis, showing how such an approach automatically leads to the

Riwar-DiVincenzo in their paper - 'Circuit quantization with time-dependent

generalises previous efforts that dealt only with discrete circuits. Moreover,
it shows through the example of a parallel-plate SQUID circuit that assigning
individual, discrete capacitances to each individual Josephson junction, as
proposed by treatments of discrete circuits, is only possible if we allow for
negative, time-dependent and even singular capacitances. In this report, we
provide numerical evidence to substantiate this result by performing
finite-difference simulations on a parallel-plate SQUID. We furnish continuous
geometries with a uniform magnetic field whose distribution we vary such that
the capacitances that are to be assigned to each Josephson junction must be
negative and even singular. Thus, the necessity for time-dependent capacitances
for appropriate quantization emerges naturally when we allow the distribution
of the magnetic field to change with time.

whereas the location of an unstable PS is known to be the shadow edge notably

spacetime has the stable outermost PS, the spacetime cannot be asymptotically
flat. A nondivergent deflection is caused for a photon traveling around a
stable PS, though a logarithmic divergent behavior is known to appear in most
of SSS compact objects with an unstable photon sphere. The reason for the
nondivergence is that the closest approach of a photon is prohibited in the
immediate vicinity of the stable PS when the photon is emitted from a source
(or reaches a receiver) distant from a lens object. The finite gap size depends
on the receiver and source distances from the lens as well as the lens
parameters. The mild deflection angle of light can be approximated by an
arcsine function. A class of SSS solutions in Weyl gravity exemplify the
nondivergent deflection near the stable outer PS.

semantic structure of the image content, e.g., by assigning a semantic label to
every pixel of the image. With the popularization of data-driven methods, the
past decades have witnessed promising progress on ASP by approaching the
problem with the schemes of tile-level scene classification or
segmentation-based image analysis, when using high-resolution aerial images.
However, the former scheme often produces results with tile-wise boundaries,
while the latter one needs to handle the complex modeling process from pixels
to semantics, which often requires large-scale and well-annotated image samples
with pixel-wise semantic labels. In this paper, we address these issues in ASP,
with perspectives from tile-level scene classification to pixel-wise semantic
labeling. Specifically, we first revisit aerial image interpretation by a
literature review. We then present a large-scale scene classification dataset
that contains one million aerial images termed Million-AID. With the presented
dataset, we also report benchmarking experiments using classical convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Finally, we perform ASP by unifying the tile-level
scene classification and object-based image analysis to achieve pixel-wise
semantic labeling. Intensive experiments show that Million-AID is a challenging
yet useful dataset, which can serve as a benchmark for evaluating newly
developed algorithms. When transferring knowledge from Million-AID, fine-tuning
CNN models pretrained on Million-AID perform consistently better than those

hierarchical multi-task learning method achieves the state-of-the-art
pixel-wise classification on the challenging GID, bridging the tile-level scene
classification toward pixel-wise semantic labeling for aerial image

learning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function
using training data that is stored across $m$ clients. In this setting, the
Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining
$\epsilon$-approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard
optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on
smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss
functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this
additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent
(FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank
structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of
communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server
can use to approximate clients' gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM
problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can
have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle
complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some
assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter,

financial data trackers, security, anomaly detection, and load balancing. In
that respect, quantiles are of particular interest, as they often capture the
user's utility. For example, if a video connection has high tail latency, the
perceived quality will suffer, even if the average and median latencies are
low.
  In this work, we consider the problem of approximating the per-item
quantiles. Elements in our stream are (ID, latency) tuples, and we wish to
track the latency quantiles for each ID.
  Existing quantile sketches are designed for a single number stream (e.g.,
containing just the latency). While one could allocate a separate sketch
instance for each ID, this may require an infeasible amount of memory. Instead,
we consider tracking the quantiles for the heavy hitters (most frequent items),
which are often considered particularly important, without knowing them
beforehand.
  We first present a simple sampling algorithm that serves as a benchmark.
Then, we design an algorithm that augments a quantile sketch within each entry
of a heavy hitter algorithm, resulting in similar space complexity but with a
deterministic error guarantee. Finally, we present SQUAD, a method that
combines sampling and sketching while improving the asymptotic space
complexity. Intuitively, SQUAD uses a background sampling process to capture
the behaviour of the latencies of an item before it is allocated with a sketch,
thereby allowing us to use fewer samples and sketches. Our solutions are
rigorously analyzed, and we demonstrate the superiority of our approach using
extensive simulations.

quasidegenerate neutrino masses with the sum of neutrino masses between 100 and

brings inherent optimization difficulties. While the traditional
back-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants
are effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima
and are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown
that the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a
convex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs.
However, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential
complexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this
work, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two
efficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The
first algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier
(ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate
counterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several
iterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving
the approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic.
The second algorithm, based on the ""sampled convex programs"" theory, is simpler
to implement. It solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an
approximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN
training landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We
apply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop
convex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs. Our analysis
explicitly focuses on one-hidden-layer fully connected ANNs, but can extend to
more sophisticated architectures.

extended phase space of Bardeen-AdS black holes surrounded by quintessence dark
energy is investigated. The occurring condition of chaos is obtained with the
Melnikov integral. It is shown that spatial chaos is always supposed to occur
even for a tiny spatially periodic perturbation imposed on the equilibrium
configuration. However, the temporal chaos will arise in the unstable spinodal
region only if the given perturbed amplitude {\gamma} is larger than a critical
value {\gamma}c. The value of {\gamma}c is determined by the magnetic monopole
charge \b{eta}, the initial temperature T0, the quintessence state parameter
{\omega}, and the quintessence normalization parameter a. Particularly,
combining the effects of {\omega} and a together, we find that the quintessence
appears quite similar to an enhancing/damped mechanism. In other words, there
exists a critical value \r{ho}c of the quintessence dark energy density \r{ho}.
In the region of \r{ho} < \r{ho}c, the existence of quintessence leads to a
reduction in the viscosity of black holes and thus makes the system more likely
to exhibit chaotic behavior. Conversely, given the energy density \r{ho} >
\r{ho}c, the system acquires higher viscosity so that it is endowed with the
ability to endure a larger thermal fluctuation.

as an advanced nuclear medicine imaging technique that yields quantitative
images of regional in vivo biology and biochemistry. The compact size of the
SiPM allows direct one to one coupling between the scintillation crystal and
the photosensor, yielding better timing and energy resolutions than the light
sharing methods that have to be used in photomultiplier tube (PMT) PET systems.
To decrease the volume of readout electronics, a front end multiplexer with
position decoder is a common choice for the one to one system without a highly
integrated application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). However, in this
case we cannot measure each crystal's deposited energy inspired by an
annihilation photon, so the inter-crystal scatter (ICS) events will lead to the
crystal mispositioning and then deteriorate the detector intrinsic resolution.
Besides, considering the events rejection within the energy window resulting
from the gain dispersion and nonlinear outputs of the SiPMs, an energy
correction mechanism is needed. Yet, lack of the information of each crystal's
energy will introduce large energy correction error for the ICS events. For
this issue, an online energy correction mechanism implemented on a Kintext-7
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device is presented in this paper.
Experiments in the laboratory were performed using an 8 x 8 segmented LYSO
crystals coupled with an 8 x 8 SiPM (J-series, from ON Semiconductor) array
which is under 22Na point source excitation. Test results indicate that both
the energy of the non-ICS and ICS events can be precisely corrected and the
energy resolution is better than 12 %. We also applied this method to an actual

Notably, we do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the outlying

cloud modeling, they are still falling behind their voxel-based competitors in
3D detection. We observe that the prevailing set abstraction design for
down-sampling points may maintain too much unimportant background information
that can affect feature learning for detecting objects. To tackle this issue,
we propose a novel set abstraction method named Semantics-Augmented Set
Abstraction (SASA). Technically, we first add a binary segmentation module as
the side output to help identify foreground points. Based on the estimated
point-wise foreground scores, we then propose a semantics-guided point sampling
algorithm to help retain more important foreground points during down-sampling.
In practice, SASA shows to be effective in identifying valuable points related
to foreground objects and improving feature learning for point-based 3D
detection. Additionally, it is an easy-to-plug-in module and able to boost
various point-based detectors, including single-stage and two-stage ones.
Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI and nuScenes datasets validate the
superiority of SASA, lifting point-based detection models to reach comparable
performance to state-of-the-art voxel-based methods.

excellent performance in the fields of computer vision, image processing, and

produce erroneous results - for example, minor perturbations of the inputs of
these networks can result in severe classification errors. Numerous
verification approaches have been proposed in recent years to prove the absence
of such errors, but these are typically geared for fully connected networks and
suffer from exacerbated scalability issues when applied to convolutional
networks. To address this gap, we present here the Cnn-Abs framework, which is
particularly aimed at the verification of convolutional networks. The core of
Cnn-Abs is an abstraction-refinement technique, which simplifies the
verification problem through the removal of convolutional connections in a way
that soundly creates an over-approximation of the original problem; and which
restores these connections if the resulting problem becomes too abstract.
Cnn-Abs is designed to use existing verification engines as a backend, and our

Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and
right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model~(i.e. implicitly) and
optionally allowing interaction of the two flows(i.e. explicitly), while the

implicitly exploiting bidirectional context, and the sentence-level ensemble
play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining

software engineering tasks. However, developers can create or pick arbitrary
identifiers when writing source code. Freely chosen identifiers lead to the
notorious out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem that negatively affects model
performance. Recently, Karampatsis et al. showed that using the Byte Pair
Encoding (BPE) algorithm to address the OOV problem can improve the language
models' predictive performance on source code. However, a drawback of BPE is
that it cannot split the identifiers in a way that preserves the meaningful
semantics. Prior researchers also show that splitting compound identifiers into
sub-words that reflect the semantics can benefit software development tools.
These two facts motivate us to explore whether identifier splitting techniques
can be utilized to augment the BPE algorithm and boost the performance of
open-vocabulary language models considered in Karampatsis et al.'s work.
  This paper proposes to split identifiers in both constructing vocabulary and
processing model inputs procedures, thus exploiting three different settings of
applying identifier splitting to language models for the code completion task.
We contrast models' performance under these settings and find that simply
inserting identifier splitting into the pipeline hurts the model performance,
while a hybrid strategy combining identifier splitting and the BPE algorithm
can outperform the original open-vocabulary models on predicting identifiers by
3.68% of recall and 6.32% of Mean Reciprocal Rank. The results also show that
the hybrid strategy can improve the entropy of language models by 2.02%.

cluster topology resulting from randomly distributed BSs. Based on
stochastic-geometry tools where BSs locations are modeled as the Poison point

UE with an arbitrary movement trajectory. Furthermore, a GCHO skipping (GCHO-S)

scenarios. The numerical results show that the GCHO scheme decreases the

the decoding can further improve the recognition performance of E2E ASR
systems. To align with the modeling units adopted in E2E ASR systems,
subword-level (e.g., characters, BPE) LMs are usually used to cooperate with
current E2E ASR systems. However, the use of subword-level LMs will ignore the
word-level information, which may limit the strength of the external LMs in E2E
ASR. Although several methods have been proposed to incorporate word-level
external LMs in E2E ASR, these methods are mainly designed for languages with
clear word boundaries such as English and cannot be directly applied to
languages like Mandarin, in which each character sequence can have multiple
corresponding word sequences. To this end, we propose a novel decoding
algorithm where a word-level lattice is constructed on-the-fly to consider all
possible word sequences for each partial hypothesis. Then, the LM score of the
hypothesis is obtained by intersecting the generated lattice with an external
word N-gram LM. The proposed method is examined on both Attention-based
Encoder-Decoder (AED) and Neural Transducer (NT) frameworks. Experiments

  Patterns",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for describing
metadata, such as attributes and relationships of resources on the Web. Machine
learning tasks for RDF graphs adopt three methods: (i) support vector machines
(SVMs) with RDF graph kernels, (ii) RDF graph embeddings, and (iii) relational
graph convolutional networks. In this paper, we propose a novel feature vector
(called a Skip vector) that represents some features of each resource in an RDF
graph by extracting various combinations of neighboring edges and nodes. In
order to make the Skip vector low-dimensional, we select important features for
classification tasks based on the information gain ratio of each feature. The
classification tasks can be performed by applying the low-dimensional Skip
vector of each resource to conventional machine learning algorithms, such as
SVMs, the k-nearest neighbors method, neural networks, random forests, and
AdaBoost. In our evaluation experiments with RDF data, such as Wikidata,
DBpedia, and YAGO, we compare our method with RDF graph kernels in an SVM. We
also compare our method with the two approaches: RDF graph embeddings such as
RDF2vec and relational graph convolutional networks on the AIFB, MUTAG, BGS,

SiGe). The controlled synthesis of such hexagonal (2H) Ge phase is a challenge
that can be overcome by using wurtzite GaAs nanowires as a template. However,
depending on growth conditions, unusual basal stacking faults (BSFs) of
I$_3$-type are formed in the metastable 2H structure. The growth of such
core/shell heterostructures is observed in situ and in real-time by means of
environmental transmission electron microscopy using chemical vapour
deposition. The observations provide direct evidence of a step-flow growth of
Ge-2H epilayers and reveal the growth-related formation of I$_3$-BSF during
unstable growth. Their formation conditions are dynamically investigated.
Through these in situ observations, we can propose a scenario for the

2H or wurtzite structures grown on m-plane substrates. Conditions are
identified to avoid their formation for perfect crystalline synthesis of

self-attention operation in Transformers which can naturally aggregate

a global image representation. In addition, the output tokens from Transformer
layers filtered by the fused attention mask are considered as key-patch
descriptors, which are used to perform spatial matching to re-rank the
candidates retrieved by the global image features. The whole model allows
end-to-end training with a single objective and image-level supervision.
TransVPR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several real-world benchmarks

SAFS is a model-agnostic approach with usability across different discovery

law of entanglement entropy for a novel doubly holographic model called wedge
holography. We work out the effective action of quantum gravity on the branes.
In the perturbative formulation, it is given by an infinite sum of Pauli-Fierz
actions. In the non-perturbative formulation, the effective action is composed
of a higher derivative gravity and a matter action. Usually, a higher
derivative gravity can be renormalizable but suffers the ghost problem. For our
case, since the effective theory on the brane is equivalent to Einstein gravity
in the bulk, it must be ghost-free. We notice that the matter action plays an
important role in eliminating the ghost. We also provide evidences that the
higher derivative gravity on the brane is equivalent to a ghost-free
multi-gravity. Besides, we prove that the effective action yields the correct
Weyl anomaly. Interestingly, although the effective action on the brane is an
infinite tower of higher derivative gravity, the holographic Weyl anomaly is
exactly the same as that of Einstein gravity. We also analyze the mass spectrum
of wedge holography. Remarkably, there is always a massless mode of gravitons
on the end-of-the-world branes in wedge holography. This happens because one
imposes Neumann boundary condition on both branes. On the other hand, the
massless mode disappears if one imposes Dirichlet boundary condition on one of
the branes as in brane world theory and AdS/BCFT. Finally, we verify the first
law of entanglement entropy for wedge holography. Interestingly, the massive
fluctuations are irrelevant to the first order perturbation of the holographic
entanglement entropy. Thus, in many aspects, the effective theory on the brane
behaves like massless Einstein gravity.

On the other hand, the zero point energy of heavy fields develop nonlinearities
on sub-Hubble scales and can not contribute to dark energy. We speculate that
our proposal may provide a resolution for both the old and new cosmological
constant problems by noting that there exists a field, the (lightest) neutrino,
which happens to have a mass comparable to the present background photon
temperature. The proposal predicts multiple transient periods of dark energy in
early and late expansion history of the universe yielding to a higher value of
the current Hubble expansion rate which can resolve the $H_0$ tension problem.

equivalence-preserving transformations of WCSPs) is well-known and finds its
use in many algorithms to approximate or bound the optimal WCSP value. In
contrast, the concept of super-reparametrizations (which are changes of the
weights that keep or increase the WCSP objective for every assignment) was
already proposed but never studied in detail. To fill this gap, we present a
number of theoretical properties of super-reparametrizations and compare them
to those of reparametrizations. Furthermore, we propose a framework for
computing upper bounds on the optimal value of the (maximization version of)
WCSP using super-reparametrizations. We show that it is in principle possible
to employ arbitrary (under some technical conditions) constraint propagation
rules to improve the bound. For arc consistency in particular, the method
reduces to the known Virtual AC (VAC) algorithm. We implemented the method for
singleton arc consistency (SAC) and compared it to other strong local
consistencies in WCSPs on a public benchmark. The results show that the bounds
obtained from SAC are superior for many instance groups.

Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), some optimality conditions for the

the structure of the corresponding optimal control is presented. By employing
the optimality conditions, we formulate a parameterized system so that its
solution space is the same as that of the nonlinear optimal interception

without using any optimization method, is sufficient to generate enough sampled

network, trained by the generated data, is able to represent the mapping from

guidance is exemplified and studied through simulations, showing that the

chemical kinetics is proposed and validated using high-temperature
auto-ignitions, perfectly stirred reactors (PSR), and one-dimensional freely
propagating flames of n-heptane/air mixtures. The mechanism reduction is
modeled as an optimization problem on Boolean space, where a Boolean vector,
each entry corresponding to a species, represents a reduced mechanism. The
optimization goal is to minimize the reduced mechanism size given the error
tolerance of a group of pre-selected benchmark quantities. The key idea of the
DeePMR is to employ a deep neural network (DNN) to formulate the objective
function in the optimization problem. In order to explore high dimensional
Boolean space efficiently, an iterative DNN-assisted data sampling and DNN
training procedure are implemented. The results show that DNN-assistance
improves sampling efficiency significantly, selecting only $10^5$ samples out
of $10^{34}$ possible samples for DNN to achieve sufficient accuracy. The
results demonstrate the capability of the DNN to recognize key species and
reasonably predict reduced mechanism performance. The well-trained DNN
guarantees the optimal reduced mechanism by solving an inverse optimization
problem. By comparing ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, temperatures
in PSRs, the resulting skeletal mechanism has fewer species (45 species) but
the same level of accuracy as the skeletal mechanism (56 species) obtained by
the Path Flux Analysis (PFA) method. In addition, the skeletal mechanism can be
further reduced to 28 species if only considering atmospheric,
near-stoichiometric conditions (equivalence ratio between 0.6 and 1.2). The
DeePMR provides an innovative way to perform model reduction and demonstrates
the great potential of data-driven methods in the combustion area.

formation. There is now increasing evidence that some of these objects may have
formed via fragmentation in gravitationally unstable discs. We present a suite
of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of binary star systems
with circumprimary self-gravitating discs, which include a realistic
approximation to radiation transport, and extensively explore the companion's
orbital parameter space for configurations which may trigger fragmentation. We
identify a ""sweet spot"" where intermediate separation binary companions ($100$
AU $\lesssim a\lesssim400$ AU) can cause a marginally stable disc to fragment.
The exact range of ideal binary separations is a function of the companion's
eccentricity, inclination and mass. Heating is balanced by efficient cooling,
and fragmentation occurs inside a spiral mode driven by the companion. Short
separation, disc penetrating binary encounters ($a\lesssim100$ AU) are
prohibitive to fragmentation, as mass stripping and disc heating quench any
instability. This is also true of binary companions with high orbital
eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.75$). Wide separation companions ($a\gtrsim500$ AU)
have little effect on the disc properties for the setup parameters considered
here. The sweet spot found is consistent with the range of binary separations
which display an excess of close in giant planets and brown dwarfs. Hence we
suggest that fragmentation triggered by a binary companion may contribute to
the formation of these substellar objects.

this model in the case of short historical data for specified time series, e.g.
in the case of new stores or new products in the sales prediction problem. In
the study of predictive models stacking, the models ARIMA, Neural Network,
Random Forest, Extra Tree were used for the prediction on the first level of
model ensemble. On the second level, time series predictions of these models on
the validation set were used for stacking by Bayesian regression. This approach
gives distributions for regression coefficients of these models. It makes it

controlled intensity distribution, using a diffractive optical element (DOE)
involving phase asymmetry. The asymmetry in the phase distribution is
introduced by shifting the coordinates in a complex plane. The results show
that auto-focusing properties of aALBs remain invariant with respect to the
asymmetry parameters. However, a controlled variation in the phase asymmetry
allows to control the spatial intensity distribution of aALBs. In an ideal ALB
containing equal intensity three bright lobes (for $m=3$), by introducing
asymmetry most of the intensity can be transferred to any one of single bright
lobe, and forms a high-power density lobe. A precise spatial position of
high-power density lobe can be controlled by the asymmetry parameter $\beta$
and $m$, and we have determined the empirical relations for them. We have found
that for the specific values of $\beta$, the intensity in the high-power
density lobe can be enhanced by $\sim$6 times the intensity in other bright
lobes. The experimental results show a good agreement with the numerical
simulations. The findings can be suitable for applications such as in optical
trapping and manipulation as well as material processing.

mean under an individualized treatment rule. We assume a non-parametric causal
graphical model with, possibly, hidden variables and at least one adjustment
set comprised of observable variables. Moreover, we assume that observable
variables have positive costs associated with them. We define the cost of an
observable adjustment set as the sum of the costs of the variables that
comprise it. We show that in this setting there exist adjustment sets that are
minimum cost optimal, in the sense that they yield non-parametric estimators of
the interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that
control for observable adjustment sets that have minimum cost. Our results are
based on the construction of a special flow network associated with the
original causal graph. We show that a minimum cost optimal adjustment set can
be found by computing a maximum flow on the network, and then finding the set
of vertices that are reachable from the source by augmenting paths. The
optimaladj Python package implements the algorithms introduced in this paper.

are under increased pressure. This partially reflects the move towards low
carbon economies and the increased reliance on renewable power generation
systems. There has been a reduction in the use of traditional fossil fuel
generation systems, which provide a stable base load, and this has been
replaced with more unpredictable renewable generation. As a consequence, the
available load on the grid is becoming more unstable. To cope with this
variability, the UK National Grid has placed emphasis on the investigation of
various technical mechanisms (e.g. implementation of smart grids, energy
storage technologies, auxiliary power sources), which may be able to prevent
critical situations, when the grid may become sometimes unstable. The
successful implementation of these mechanisms may require large numbers of
electrical consumers (e.g. HVAC systems, food refrigeration systems) for
example to make additional investments in energy storage technologies (food
refrigeration systems) or to integrate their electrical demand from industrial
processes into the National Grid (HVAC systems). However, in the situation of
food refrigeration systems, during these critical situations, even if the
thermal inertia within refrigeration systems may maintain effective performance
of the device for a short period of time (e.g. under 1 minute) when the
electrical input load into the system is reduced, this still carries the
paramount risk of food safety even for very short periods of time (e.g. under 1
minute). Therefore before considering any future actions (e.g. investing in
energy storage technologies) to prevent the critical situations when grid
becomes unstable, it is also needed to understand during the normal use how the
temperature profiles evolve along the time inside these massive networks of
food refrigeration systems.

and training strategies makes performance comparison between methods difficult.
In particular, for attention-based FSOD methods, it is laborious to compare the
impact of the different attention mechanisms on performance. This paper aims at
filling this shortcoming. To do so, a flexible framework is proposed to allow
the implementation of most of the attention techniques available in the
literature. To properly introduce such a framework, a detailed review of the
existing FSOD methods is firstly provided. Some different attention mechanisms

with phase shift keying (PSK) signaling is presented for broadband wireless
communications systems empowered by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS).
In the proposed CPSC-RIS, the RIS is configured according to the transmitted
PSK symbols such that different cyclically delayed versions of the incident
signal are created by the RIS to achieve multipath diversity. A practical and
efficient channel estimator is developed for CPSC-RIS and the mean square error
of the channel estimation is expressed in closed-form. We analyze the bit error
rate (BER) performance of CPSC-RIS over frequency-selective Nakagami-$m$ fading
channels. An upper bound on the BER is derived by assuming the
maximum-likelihood detection. Furthermore, by resorting to the concept of index
modulation (IM), we propose an extension of CPSC-RIS, termed CPSC-RIS-IM, which
enhances the spectral efficiency. In addition to conventional constellation
information of PSK symbols, CPSC-RIS-IM uses the full permutations of cyclic
delays caused by the RIS to carry information. A sub-optimal receiver is
designed for CPSC-RIS-IM to aim at low computational complexity. Our simulation
results in terms of BER corroborate the performance analysis and the
superiority of CPSC-RIS(-IM) over the conventional CPSC without an RIS and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with an RIS.

sales time series analytics. In contrast to supervised machine learning which
is a kind of passive learning using historical data, Q-learning is a kind of
active learning with goal to maximize a reward by optimal sequence of actions.
Model free Q-learning approach for optimal pricing strategies and supply-demand
problems was considered in the work. The main idea of the study is to show that
using deep Q-learning approach in time series analytics, the sequence of
actions can be optimized by maximizing the reward function when the environment
for learning agent interaction can be modeled using the parametric model and in
the case of using the model which is based on the historical data. In the
pricing optimizing case study environment was modeled using sales dependence on
extras price and randomly simulated demand. In the pricing optimizing case
study, the environment was modeled using sales dependence on extra price and
randomly simulated demand. In the supply-demand case study, it was proposed to
use historical demand time series for environment modeling, agent states were
represented by promo actions, previous demand values and weekly seasonality
features. Obtained results show that using deep Q-learning, we can optimize the
decision making process for price optimization and supply-demand problems.
Environment modeling using parametric models and historical data can be used
for the cold start of learning agent. On the next steps, after the cold start,
the trained agent can be used in real business environment.

generalizes Mandelbrot percolation, where Galton-Watson trees (whose offspring
distribution is not necessarily binomial) are projected to $\mathbb{R}^d$ by a
coding map which arises from an iterated function system (IFS) of similarity
maps. We show that for such a random fractal $E$, whenever the underlying IFS
satisfies the open set condition, almost surely the Assouad dimension of $E$ is
the maximal Hausdorff dimension of a set in $\text{supp}\left(E\right)$, the
lower dimension is the smallest Hausdorff dimension of a set in
$\text{supp}\left(E\right)$, and every value in between is the Hausdorff
dimension of some microset of $E$. In order to obtain the above, we first
analyze the relation between the collection of microsets of a (deterministic)
set, and certain limits of subtrees of an appropriate coding tree for that set.
The results of this analysis are also applied, with the required adjustments,
to gain some insights on Furstenberg's homogeneity property. We define a weaker
property than homogeneity and show that for self-homothetic sets in
$\mathbb{R}$ whose Hausdorff dimension is smaller than 1, it is equivalent to
the weak separation condition.

in recent years. SW originates from solar perturbations and is comprised of the
resulting complex variations they cause within the systems between the Sun and
Earth. These systems are tightly coupled and not well understood. This creates
a need for skillful models with knowledge about the confidence of their
predictions. One example of such a dynamical system is the thermosphere, the
neutral region of Earth's upper atmosphere. Our inability to forecast it has
severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and collision avoidance
operations for objects in low Earth orbit. Even with (assumed) perfect driver
forecasts, our incomplete knowledge of the system results in often inaccurate
neutral mass density predictions. Continuing efforts are being made to improve
model accuracy, but density models rarely provide estimates of uncertainty. In
this work, we propose two techniques to develop nonlinear ML models to predict
thermospheric density while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates: Monte
Carlo (MC) dropout and direct prediction of the probability distribution, both
using the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD) loss function. We
show the performance for models trained on local and global datasets. This
shows that NLPD provides similar results for both techniques but the direct
probability method has a much lower computational cost. For the global model
regressed on the SET HASDM density database, we achieve errors of 11% on
independent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Using an
in-situ CHAMP density dataset, both techniques provide test error on the order
of 13%. The CHAMP models (on independent data) are within 2% of perfect
calibration for all prediction intervals tested. This model can also be used to
obtain global predictions with uncertainties at a given epoch.

grain surface chemistry and cosmic-ray induced and direct desorption of ices.
The predicted OPRs are found to deviate significantly from both thermal and

OPR of H$_2$O is shown to lie between 1.5 and 2.6, depending on the spin-state

relatively high extinction. In the prestellar core collapse calculations, the
OPR of H$_2$O is shown to reach the statistical value of 3 in regions with
severe depletion ($n_{\rm H}> 10^7$~cm$^{-3}$). We conclude that a low water
OPR ($\lesssim 2.5$) is consistent with gas-phase ion-neutral chemistry and
reflects a gas with OPR(H$_2)\lesssim 1$. Available OPR measurements in

dyadic, triadic and higher-order interactions. We study STM cascades over
``small-world'' models that contain both short- and long-range $k$-simplices,
exploring how spatio-temporal patterns manifest as a frustration between local
and nonlocal propagations. We show that higher-order coupling and nonlinear
thresholding can coordinate to robustly guide cascades along a
simplicial-generalization of paths that we call $k$-dimensional ``geometrical
channels''. We also find this coordination to enhance the diversity and
efficiency of cascades over a ``neuronal complex'', i.e., a
simplicial-complex-based model for a neuronal network. We support these
findings with bifurcation theory and a data-driven approach based on latent
geometry. Our findings and mathematical techniques provide fruitful directions
for uncovering the multiscale, multidimensional mechanisms that orchestrate the

angle inhomogeneity in high field MRI systems without subject-specific
optimization, originally developed for parallel transmit (PTX) systems at 7T.
We investigated the potential benefits of UPs for single channel (SC) transmit
systems at 3T, which are widely used for clinical and research imaging, and for
which flip angle inhomogeneity can still be problematic.
  Methods: SC-UPs were designed using a spiral nonselective k-space trajectory
for brain imaging at 3T using transmit field maps (B1+) and off-resonance maps
(B0) acquired on two different scanner types: a 'standard' single channel
transmit system and a system with a PTX body coil. The effect of training group
size was investigated using data (200 subjects) from the standard system. The
PTX system was used to compare SC-UPs to PTX-UPs (15 subjects). In two
additional subjects, prospective imaging using SC-UP was studied.
  Results: Average flip angle error fell from 9.5+/-0.5% for 'default'
excitation to 3.0+/-0.6% using SC-UPs trained over 50 subjects. Performance of
the UPs was found to steadily improve as training group size increased, but
stabilized after ~15 subjects. On the PTX-enabled system, SC-UPs again
outperformed default excitation in simulations (4.8+/-0.6% error versus
10.6+/-0.8% respectively) though greater homogenization could be achieved with
PTX-UPs (3.9+/-0.6%) and personalized pulses (SC-PP 3.6+/-1.0%, PTX-PP
2.9+/-0.6%). MP-RAGE imaging using SC-UP resulted in greater separation between
grey and white matter signal intensities than default excitation.
  Conclusions: SC-UPs can improve excitation homogeneity in standard 3T systems
without further calibration and could be used instead of a default excitation
pulse for nonselective neuroimaging at 3T.

for calculating: (i) elemental chemical potentials, (ii) defect (dopant)
formation energies and transition energy levels, (iii) defect and carrier
densities and (iv) carrier dynamics properties of high-density defects. DASP
uses the materials genome database for quick determination of competing
secondary phases and calculation of the energy above convex hull when
calculating the elemental chemical potential that stabilizes compound
semiconductors, so it can perform high-throughput prediction of thermodynamic
stability of multinary compounds. DASP calls the ab-initio softwares to perform
the total energy, structural relaxation and electronic structure calculations
of the defect supercells with different structure configurations and charge
states, based on which the defect formation energies and transition energy
levels are calculated and the corrections for electrostatic potential alignment
and image charge interaction can be included. Then DASP can calculate the
equilibrium densities of defects and electron and hole carriers as well as the
Fermi level in semiconductors under different chemical potential conditions and
different growth/working temperature. For high-density defects, DASP can
calculate the carrier dynamics properties such as the photoluminescence (PL)
spectrum, defect-related radiative and non-radiative carrier capture cross
sections, and recombination lifetime of non-equilibrium carriers.

in contrast to Maxwell's demons which do not necessarily need to satisfy
detailed balance. This is in stark contrast with typical Monte Carlo
algorithms, which choose an action at random at each time step. It is thus
natural to compare the behavior of these kobolds to a Metropolis algorithm. For
various Ising models, we study numerically and analytically the properties of
the optimal strategies, showing that there is a transition in the behavior of
the kobold as a function of the parameter characterizing its strategy.

Moreover, based on the single Doppler shift property for each TSL and sparsity
of delay-Doppler domain channel, we develop a parametric approach to further
refine the CE performance. Finally, a least square based parallel time domain
SD method is developed to detect the OTFS signals with relatively low

treating the boundary-dissipation operators as a perturbation, we derive an
analytical expression of the Liouvillian gap, which indicates clearly the
Liouvillian gap being proportional to the minimum of boundary densities of
eigenstates of the underlying Hamiltonian, and thus give a theoretical
explanation why the Liouvillian gap has different size scaling relation in the
extended and localized phase. While the Liouvillian gap displays a power-law
size scaling $\Delta_{g}\propto L^{- 3}$ in the extended phase, our analytical
result unveils that the Liouvillian gap fulfills an exponential scaling
relation $\Delta_{g}\propto e^{- \kappa L}$ in the localized phase, where
$\kappa$ takes the largest Lyapunov exponent of localized eigenstates of the
underlying Hamiltonian. By scrutinizing the extended Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper

scaling relation and the fitting exponent $\kappa$ coincides pretty well with
the analytical result of Lyapunov exponent. The exponential scaling relation is
further verified numerically in other one-dimensional quasiperiodic and random

also see that high equilibrium temperature planets (T$_{eq}$ $\ge$ 1800 K)
favor inefficient recirculation in comparison to the low temperature planets.
Our planet-specific models do not reveal any definitive population trends in
metallicity and C/O ratio with current data precision, but more than 59 % of
our sample size is consistent with the C/O ratio $\leq$ 1 and 35 % are
consistent with whole range (0.35 $\leq$ C/O $\leq$ 1.5). We also find that for
most of the planets in our sample, 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu m$ model EDs lie within
$\pm$1 $\sigma$ of the observed EDs. Intriguingly, few hot Jupiters exhibit
greater thermal emission than predicted by the hottest atmospheric models

thermal emission from hot Jupiters with the James Webb Space Telescope will be
necessary to robustly identify population trends in chemical compositions with

modified dispersion relations (MDRs) of photons in vacuum, obtained in some
attempts to formulate a theory of Quantum Gravity. The MDRs in use imply time
delays which depend on the energy, and which increase with distance following
some function of redshift. The use of transient, or variable, distant and
highly energetic sources, already allows us to set stringent limits on the
energy scale related to this phenomenon, usually thought to be of the order of
the Planck energy, but robust conclusions on the existence of MDR-related
propagation effects still require the analysis of a large population of
sources.
  In order to gather the biggest sample of sources possible for MDR searches at
teraelectronvolt energies, the H.E.S.S., MAGIC and VERITAS collaborations
enacted a joint task force to combine all their relevant data to constrain the

based on observed ratings from the population. As with all observational
studies, hidden confounders, which are factors that affect both item exposures
and user ratings, lead to a systematic bias in the estimation. Consequently, a
new trend in recommender system research is to negate the influence of
confounders from a causal perspective. Observing that confounders in
recommendations are usually shared among items and are therefore multi-cause
confounders, we model the recommendation as a multi-cause multi-outcome (MCMO)
inference problem. Specifically, to remedy confounding bias, we estimate
user-specific latent variables that render the item exposures independent
Bernoulli trials. The generative distribution is parameterized by a DNN with
factorized logistic likelihood and the intractable posteriors are estimated by
variational inference. Controlling these factors as substitute confounders,
under mild assumptions, can eliminate the bias incurred by multi-cause
confounders. Furthermore, we show that MCMO modeling may lead to high variance
due to scarce observations associated with the high-dimensional causal space.
Fortunately, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing user features as
pre-treatment variables can substantially improve sample efficiency and
alleviate overfitting. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world datasets
show that the proposed deep causal recommender shows more robustness to
unobserved confounders than state-of-the-art causal recommenders. Codes and

linear systems, under event-triggered control with a general class of
scale-invariant event triggering rules. In this setting, the inter-event time
is a function of the ``angle'' of the state at an event. This allows us to
analyze the inter-event times by studying the fixed points of the ``angle''
map, which represents the evolution of the ``angle'' of the state from one
event to the next. We provide a sufficient condition for the convergence or
non-convergence of inter-event times to a steady state value under a
scale-invariant event-triggering rule. With the help of ergodic theory, we
provide a sufficient condition for the asymptotic average inter-event time to
be a constant for all non-zero initial states of the system. Then, we consider
a special case where the ``angle'' map is an orientation-preserving
homeomorphism. Using rotation theory, we comment on the asymptotic behavior of
the inter-event times, including on whether the inter-event times converge to a
periodic sequence. We also analyze the asymptotic average inter-event time as a
function of the ``angle'' of the initial state of the system. We illustrate the

particle spectra up to 10 GeV/c. The radial flow ($\langle \beta \rangle$)
increases with the collision energy. The degrees of non-equilibrium ($q$) and
the Tsallis temperature parameter ($T$) show a similar behaviour, but with a
much weaker trend. With this dependence of the freeze-out parameters on the
collision energy, we evaluate $\langle \beta \rangle$, $T$ and $q$ in pp
collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 8 and 14 TeV and predict the particle spectra at
these two energies. Moreover, in order to investigate the multiplicity
dependence of the freeze-out parameters, the TBW model is extended to the
spectra at different charged-particle multiplicity classes in pp collisions at
$\sqrt{s}=$ 7 and 13 TeV. It is observed that at both energies the radial flow
increases with the multiplicity while the degree of non-equilibrium shows an
opposite behaviour, which is similar to that observed in proton-nucleus (pA)
and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
energies. However, the Tsallis temperature parameter increases with the
multiplicity, which is opposite to the trend in pA and AA collisions. At
similar multiplicities, the radial flow in pp collisions is stronger than those
in pA and AA collisions, indicating that the size of the colliding system has
significant effects on the final state particle dynamics. Finally, we apply an
additional flow correction to the Tsallis temperature parameter and find that
the doppler-corrected temperature parameter almost scales with the multiplicity
in a uniform way, despite the difference in the colliding system and collision
energy.

the interface between the loading piston and sample are nearly linearly
dependent on differential applied load due to the load dependence of interface
stiffness. Measurements of such delays can be used to infer sample load
internally. We illustrate the working of the apparatus by conducting
experiments on limestone at 200 MPa confining pressure and room temperature and
400$^\circ$C. Ultrasonic data clearly show that deformation is dominated by
microcracking at low temperature and by intracrystalline plasticity at high
temperature.

metals cooled down to very low temperatures. The ubiquity of such conventional
superconductors, and the wide range of associated critical temperatures, is
readily understood in terms of the celebrated Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
theory. Occasionally, however, unconventional superconductors are found, such
as the iron-based materials, which extend and defy this understanding in new
and unexpected ways. In the case of the iron-based superconductors, this
includes a new appreciation of the ways in which the presence of multiple
atomic orbitals can manifest in unconventional superconductivity, giving rise
to a rich landscape of gap structures that share the same dominant pairing
mechanism. Besides superconductivity, these materials have also led to new
insights into the unusual metallic state governed by the Hund's interaction,
the control and mechanisms of electronic nematicity, the impact of magnetic
fluctuations and quantum criticality, and the significance of topology in
correlated states. Over the thirteen years since their discovery, they have
proven to be an incredibly fruitful testing ground for the development of new
experimental tools and theoretical approaches, both of which have extensively
influenced the wider field of quantum materials.

reduced order modeling of turbulence-chemistry interactions is assessed. DBO is
an on-the-fly low-rank approximation technique, in which the instantaneous
composition matrix of the reactive flow field is decomposed into a set of
orthonormal spatial modes, a set of orthonormal vectors in the composition
space, and a factorization of the low-rank correlation matrix. Two factors
which distinguish between DBO and the reduced order models (ROMs) based on the
principal component analysis (PCA) are: (i) DBO does not require any offline
data generation; and (ii) in DBO the low-rank composition subspace is
time-dependent as opposed to static subspaces in PCA. Because of these
features, DBO can adapt on-the-fly to intrinsic and externally excited
transient changes in state of the transport variables. For demonstration,
simulations are conducted of a non-premixed CO/H2 flame in a temporally
evolving jet. The GRI-Mech 3.0 model with 53 species is used for chemical
kinetics modeling. The results are appraised via a posteriori comparisons
against data generated via full-rank direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the

excellent predictions of various statistics of the thermo-chemical variables.

variant graph algorithm is versatile and is capable of reconstructing
transformation microstructures from any parent-child combination by clustering
together child grains based on a common parent orientation variant. The main
advantage of the variant graph over the grain graph is its inherent ability to
more accurately detect prior austenite grain boundaries.
  A critical examination of Markovian clustering and neighbor level voting as
methods to reconstruct prior austenite orientations is first conducted.
Following this, the performance of the variant graph algorithm is showcased by
reconstructing the prior austenite grains and boundaries from an example
low-carbon lath martensite steel microstructure. Programmatic extensions to the
variant graph algorithm for specific morphological conditions and the merging
of variants with small mutual disorientation angles are also proposed. The
accuracy of the reconstruction and the computational performance of the variant

sufficient large-scale structures are continuously enforced through temporally
continuous data assimilation (TCDA). In the current work, we show that the
assimilation time step can be relaxed to values about 1 $\sim$ 2 orders larger
than that for TCDA, using a temporally sparse data assimilation (TSDA)
strategy, while the accuracy is still maintained or even slightly better in the
presence of non-negligible large-scale errors. The one-step data assimilation
(ODA) is examined to unravel the mechanism of TSDA. It is shown that the
relaxation effect for errors above the assimilation wavenumber $k_a$ is
responsible for the error decay in ODA. Meanwhile, The errors contained in the
large scales can propagate into small scales and make the high-wavenumber
($k>k_a$) error noise decay slower with TCDA than TSDA. This mechanism is
further confirmed by incorporating different levels of errors in the large
scales of the reference flow field. The advantage of TSDA is found to grow with
the magnitude of the incorporated errors. Thus, it is potentially more
beneficial to adopt TSDA if the reference data contains non-negligible errors.
Finally, an outstanding issue raised in previous works regarding the
possibility of recovering the dynamics of sub-Kolmogorov scales using direct
numerical simulation (DNS) data at Kolmogorov scale resolution is also
discussed.

principle is generically broken in an idiosyncratic manner, manifested in the
action of an ""external field effect (EFE)"". The internal dynamics in a
self-gravitating system is affected even by a constant external field. In disk
galaxies the EFE can induce warps and modify the rotational speeds. Due to the
non-linearity of MOND, it is difficult to derive analytic expressions of this
important effect in a disk. Here we study numerically the EFE in two
non-relativistic Lagrangian theories of MOND: the `Aquadratic-Lagrangian'
theory (AQUAL) and `Quasilinear MOND' (QUMOND). For AQUAL we consider only the
axisymmetric field configurations with the external field along the disk axis,
or a spherical galaxy with test-particle orbits inclined to the external field.
For the more manageable QUMOND we calculate also the three-dimensional field
configurations, with the external field inclined to the disk axis. We
investigate particularly to what degree an external field modifies the
quasi-flat part of rotation curves. While our QUMOND results agree well with
published numerical results in QUMOND, we find that AQUAL predicts weaker EFE
than published AQUAL results. However, AQUAL still predicts stronger EFE than
QUMOND, which demonstrates current theoretical uncertainties. We also
illustrate how the MOND prediction on the rising part of the rotation curve, in
the inner parts, depends largely on disk thickness but only weakly on a
plausible external field for a fixed galaxy model. Finally, we summarize our
results for the outer parts as an improved, approximate analytic expression.

However as for now we do not seek to justify this modification from general

tied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU
autoencoders. Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a
modification of the vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact
principal components. Finally, we show that our equations accurately describe
the generalisation dynamics of non-linear autoencoders on realistic datasets

interactions. Revealing universal collective patterns behind spatio-temporal
interactions between residents is crucial for various urban studies, of which
we are still lacking a comprehensive understanding. Massive cellphone data
enable us to construct interaction networks based on spatio-temporal
co-occurrence of individuals. The rank-size distributions of hourly dynamic
population of locations are stable, although people are almost constantly
moving in cities and hotspots that attract people are changing over time in a
day. A larger city is of a stronger heterogeneity as indicated by a larger
scaling exponent. After aggregating spatio-temporal interaction networks over
consecutive time windows, we reveal a switching behavior of cities between two
states. During the ""active"" state, the whole city is concentrated in fewer
larger communities; while in the ""sleeping"" state, people are scattered in more
smaller communities. Above discoveries are universal over diversified cities
across continents. In addition, a city sleeps less, when its population grows
larger. And spatio-temporal interaction segregation can be well approximated by
residential segregation in smaller cities, but not in larger ones. We propose a
temporal-population-weighted-opportunity model by integrating time-dependent
departure probability to make dynamic predictions on human mobility, which can
reasonably well explain observed patterns of spatio-temporal interactions in
cities.

sensitivity of force detection in a hybrid optomechanical setup assisted by
squeezed vacuum injection, beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL). The scheme
is based on a combination of the coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC)
strategy with a variational homodyne detection of the cavity output spectrum in
which the phase of the local oscillator is optimized. In CQNC, realizing a
negative-mass oscillator in the system leads to exact cancellation of the
backaction noise from the mechanics due to destructive quantum interference.
Squeezed vacuum injection enhances this cancellation and allows sub-SQL
sensitivity to be reached in a wide frequency band and at much lower input
laser powers. We show here that the adoption of variational homodyne readout
enables us to enhance this noise cancellation up to $40 ~\mathrm{dB}$ compared
to the standard case of detection of the optical output phase quadrature,
leading to a remarkable force sensitivity of the order of $10^{-19}
\mathrm{N}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, around 2-order enhancement compared to the
standard case. Moreover, we show that at nonzero cavity detuning, the signal
response can be amplified at a level three to five times larger than that in
the standard case without variational homodyne readout, improving the
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Finally, the variational readout CQNC developed in
this paper may be applied to other optomechanical-like platforms such as
levitated systems and multimode optomechanical arrays or crystals as well as
Josephson-based optomechanical systems.

can eventually hinder the exploitation of fully digitised manufacturing

absorption model that takes into account the effects of laser characteristics,
incident angle, surface temperature, and material composition is utilised to
predict internal heat and fluid flow in laser melting of stainless steel 316L.
Employing such an absorption model is physically more realistic than assuming a
constant absorptivity and can reduce the costs associated with calibrating an
appropriate value. High-fidelity three-dimensional numerical simulations were
performed using both variable and constant absorptivity models and the
predictions compared with experimental data. The results of the present work

to account for the broadening, which is a key problem in practical applications
of surface plasmon. We will introduce a density-dependent diffusion coefficient
to give very accurate linewidth. It is a self-consistent method, in which both
the ground and excited states are solved by using the same energy functional,
with the kinetic energy described by the Thomas-Fermi and von Weizs\""{a}cker

electron density-dependent damping rate. For sodium nanosphere of various
sizes, the plasmon energy and broadening by our QHT method are in excellent
agreement with those by density functional theory and Kreibig formula. By
applying our QHT method to sodium jellium nanorods, we clearly show that our
method enables a parameter-free simulation, i.e. without resorting to any
empirical parameter, such as size-dependent damping rate and diffusing
coefficient. It is found that there exists a perfect linear relation between
the resonance wavelength and aspect radio. The width decreases with increasing
aspect ratio and height. The calculations show that our QHT method provides an
explicit and unified way to account for size-dependent frequency shifts and
broadening of arbitrarily shaped geometries. It is reliable and robust with
great predicability, and hence provides a general and efficient platform to

However, a lack of numerical works assessing quantitatively the sensitivity of
these numerical simulations to grid parameters can be identified, especially
for the Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The main goal of this work is to
propose a mesh refinement methodology for simulating phase-change heat transfer
problems by means of the pseudopotential LBM. This methodology was based on
relating the physical parameters to their lattice counterparts for an arbitrary
mesh under the viscous regime (where $\Delta t \propto \Delta x ^2$). A
suitable modification of the EOS parameters and the adjusting of thermodynamic
consistency and surface tension for a certain $\Delta x$ were the main steps of
the proposed methodology. A first ensemble of simple simulations including the
droplet vaporization and the Stefan problems was performed to validate the
proposed method and to assess the influence of some physical mechanisms. Global
norms in space and time were used to evaluate the variations of both the
density and temperature fields for pool boiling simulations when the lattice
discretization is refined. It was observed that the proposed methodology
provides convergent results for all the problems considered, and the

  Biospheres""",,"10.1007/s11084-022-09619-6",,"physics.pop-ph astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Now that we know that Earth-like planets are ubiquitous in the universe, as
well as that most of them are much older than the Earth, it is justified to ask
to what extent evolutionary outcomes on other such planets are similar, or
indeed commensurable, to the outcomes we perceive around us. In order to assess
the degree of specialty or mediocrity of our trajectory of biospheric
evolution, we need to take into account recent advances in theoretical
astrobiology, in particular (i) establishing the history of habitable planets'
formation in the Galaxy, and (ii) understanding the crucial importance of
""Gaian"" feedback loops and temporal windows for the interaction of early life
with its physical environment. Hereby we consider an alternative
macroevolutionary pathway that may result in tight functional integration of
all sub-planetary ecosystems, eventually giving rise to a true superorganism at
the biospheric level. The blueprint for a possible outcome of this scenario has
been masterfully provided by the great Polish novelist Stanis{\l}aw Lem in his
1961 novel Solaris. In fact, Solaris offers such a persuasive and powerful case
for an ""extremely strong"" Gaia hypothesis that it is, arguably, high time to
investigate it in a discursive astrobiological and philosophical context. In
addition to novel predictions in the domain of potentially detectable
biosignatures, some additional cognitive and heuristic benefits of studying
such extreme cases of functional integration are briefly discussed.

Deshpande","Dielectric Properties of Polysulfone Carbon Nanotube Composite Membranes","Conference on Technologies for Future Cities 2021",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Polymeric membranes, including Polysulfone (PSf) membranes, are routinely
used for water treatment. To enhance water permeation of above membranes, it is
common to synthesize polymeric membranes with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded
in them. It is seen that water permeability of membranes having vertically
aligned CNTs is higher, as compared to those where CNTs are not aligned. It is
of interest to examine if the dielectric constant of a CNT based nanocomposite
membrane is sensitive to alignment of CNTs or not. This paper reports
dielectric properties of PSf-MWCNT membranes, both, for aligned and unaligned
MWCNTs. Multi Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) based polysulfone membranes were
synthesized using standard methods. MWCNTs in above membranes were aligned by
casting the membrane in presence of magnetic field. The present paper, for the
first time, shows that the above result is valid for membranes also.

  Online Advertising",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial component in the online
advertising industry. In order to produce a personalized CTR prediction, an
industry-level CTR prediction model commonly takes a high-dimensional (e.g.,
100 or 1000 billions of features) sparse vector (that is encoded from query
keywords, user portraits, etc.) as input. As a result, the model requires
Terabyte scale parameters to embed the high-dimensional input. Hierarchical
distributed GPU parameter server has been proposed to enable GPU with limited
memory to train the massive network by leveraging CPU main memory and SSDs as
secondary storage. We identify two major challenges in the existing GPU
training framework for massive-scale ad models and propose a collection of
optimizations to tackle these challenges: (a) the GPU, CPU, SSD rapidly
communicate with each other during the training. The connections between GPUs
and CPUs are non-uniform due to the hardware topology. The data communication
route should be optimized according to the hardware topology; (b) GPUs in
different computing nodes frequently communicates to synchronize parameters. We
are required to optimize the communications so that the distributed system can
become scalable.
  In this paper, we propose a hardware-aware training workflow that couples the
hardware topology into the algorithm design. To reduce the extensive
communication between computing nodes, we introduce a $k$-step model merging
algorithm for the popular Adam optimizer and provide its convergence rate in
non-convex optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
application of $k$-step adaptive optimization method in industrial-level CTR
model training. The numerical results on real-world data confirm that the
optimized system design considerably reduces the training time of the massive
model, with essentially no loss in accuracy.

society, traditional E-learning method has exposed some shortcomings, such as
the boring way of teaching, so that it is difficult to increase the enthusiasm
of students and raise their attention in class. The application of serious
games in E-learning can make up for these shortcomings and effectively improve
the quality of teaching. When applying serious games to E-learning, there are
two main considerations: educational goals and game design. A successful
serious game should organically combine the two aspects and balance the
educational and entertaining nature of serious games. This paper mainly
discusses the role of serious games in E-learning, various elements of game
design, the classification of the educational goals of serious games and the
relationship between educational goals and game design. In addition, we try to
classify serious games and match educational goals with game types to provide
guidance and assistance in the design of serious games. This paper also
summarizes some shortcomings that serious games may have in the application of
E-learning.

  Developing Hardware-Based Cybersecurity Countermeasures","54 pages, 17 figures/tables, 43 citations",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Modern computing systems have led cyber adversaries to create more
sophisticated malware than was previously available in the early days of
technology. Dated detection techniques such as Anti-Virus Software (AVS) based
on signature-based methods could no longer keep up with the demand that
computer systems required of them. The complexity of modern malware has led to
the development of contemporary detection techniques that use the machine
learning field and hardware to boost the detection rates of malicious software.
These new techniques use Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs) that form a
digital signature of sorts. After the models are fed training data, they can
reference these HPCs to classify zero-day malware samples. A problem emerges
when malware with no comparable HPC values comes into contact with these new
techniques. We provide an analysis of several machine learning and deep
learning models that run zero-day samples and evaluate the results from the
conversion of C++ algorithms to a hardware description language (HDL) used to
begin a hardware implementation. Our results present a lack of accuracy from
the models when running zero-day malware data as our highest detector, decision
tree, was only able to reach 91.2% accuracy and had an F1-Score of 91.5% in the
form of a decision tree. Next, through the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) and
area-under-the-curve (AUC), we can also determine that the algorithms did not
present significant robustness as the largest AUC was only 0.819. In addition,
we viewed relatively high overhead for our ensemble learning algorithm while
also only having an 86.3% accuracy and 86% F1-Score. Finally, as an additional
task, we adapted the one rule algorithm to fit many rules to make malware
classification understandable to everyday users by allowing them to view the
regulations while maintaining relatively high accuracy.
