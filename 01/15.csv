DyNi$_3$Ga$_{9}$ have been investigated by resonant x-ray diffraction. Magnetic
dipole and electric quadrupole degrees of freedom arising from the large
angular moment of $J=15/2$, in combination with the symmetric and antisymmetric
exchange interactions and the crystal field anisotropy, give rise to competing
ordered phases. We show that the antiferromagnetically coupled Dy moments in
the $ab$-plane form an incommensurate helimagnetic order with $q\sim(0, 0,
0.43)$ just below $T_{\text{N}}=10$ K, which further exhibits successive
first-order transitions to the commensurate helimagnetic order with
$q=(0,0,0.5)$ at $T_{\text{N}}^{\;\prime}=9.0$ K, and to the canted
antiferromagnetic order with $q=(0,0,0)$ at $T_{\text{N}}^{\;\prime\prime}=8.5$
K, both with large coexistence regions. The relation of the magnetic helicity
and the crystal chirality in DyNi$_3$Ga$_{9}$ is also uniquely determined.
Splitting of the $(6,0,0)$ Bragg peak is observed below
$T_{\text{N}}^{\;\prime\prime}$, reflecting the lattice distortion due to the
ferroquadrupole order. In the canted antiferromagnetic phase, a spin-flop
transition takes place at 5 K when the temperature is swept in a weak magnetic
field. We discuss these transitions from the viewpoint of competing energies
described above.

cloud? This is one of the central questions driving the SOFIA legacy program
FEEDBACK. Here, we present a case study toward the prototypical H{\sc ii}
region NGC7538. Methods: With SOFIA we mapped an area of ~210'^2 around NGC7538
in the [CII] line at 1.9THz. Complementary observed atomic carbon [CI] and
high-J CO(8-7) data as well as archival NIR/FIR, cm continuum, CO(3-2) and HI
data are folded into the analysis. Results: While the overall [CII] morphology
follows the general ionized gas, the channel maps show multiple bubble-like
structures with sizes on the order of ~80-100"" (~1.0-1.28pc). While at least
one of them may be an individual feedback bubble driven by the main exciting
sources of the region, the other bubble-morphologies may also be due to the
intrinsically porous structure of the HII region. An analysis of the expansion
velocities around 10km s^{-1} indicates that thermal expansion is not
sufficient but that wind-driving from the central O-stars is required. The most
blue-shifted [CII] component has barely any molecular or atomic counterparts.
At the interface to the molecular cloud, we find a typical photon-dominated
region (PDR) with a bar-shape. Ionized, atomic and molecular carbon show a
layered structure in this PDR. The carbon in the PDR is dominated by its
ionized form with atomic and molecular masses of ~0.45+-0.1M_{\odot} and
~1.2+-0.1M_{\odot}, respectively, compared to the ionized carbon in the range
of 3.6-9.7M_{\odot}. Conclusions: The NGC7538 HII region exhibits a diverse set
of sub-structures that interact with each other as well as with the adjacent
cloud. Compared to other recent [CII] observations of HII regions (e.g., Orion
Veil, RCW120, RCW49), bubble-shape morphologies revealed in [CII] emission,
indicative of expanding shells, are recurring structures of PDRs.

designed in a hierarchical structure, presenting broad item cluster to users
first and subsequently guiding them through another selection round, which
allows the presentation of a large number of items. Cluster/item selection in
GaVe is based on the dwell time of fixations, i.e., the time duration that
users look at a given Cluster/item. A user study (N=22) was conducted to test
optimal dwell time thresholds and comfortable human-to-display distances.
Users' perception of the system, as well as error rates and task completion

system with a short time training, and showed good performance during system
usage, selecting a target item within a group of 12 items in 6.76 seconds on

the optimal graph structure is still unexplored. In essence, an optimal graph
structure should only contain the information about tasks while compress
redundant noise as much as possible, which is defined as ""minimal sufficient

extensive experiments on several datasets under clean and attacked conditions,

equipment that provides power to a single household. A crucial resource for
targeting further investment of public and private resources, as well as
tracking the progress of universal electrification goals, is shared access to
high-quality data on individual SHS installations including information such as

and machine learning to detect solar panels have emerged, they struggle to
accurately locate many SHS due to limited image resolution (some small solar
panels only occupy several pixels in satellite imagery). In this work, we
explore the viability and cost-performance tradeoff of using automatic SHS
detection on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery as an alternative to
satellite imagery. More specifically, we explore three questions: (i) what is
the detection performance of SHS using drone imagery; (ii) how expensive is the
drone data collection, compared to satellite imagery; and (iii) how well does
drone-based SHS detection perform in real-world scenarios. We collect and
publicly-release a dataset of high-resolution drone imagery encompassing SHS
imaged under real-world conditions and use this dataset and a dataset from
Rwanda to evaluate the capabilities of deep learning models to recognize SHS,
including those that are too small to be reliably recognized in satellite
imagery. The results suggest that UAV imagery may be a viable alternative to
identify very small SHS from perspectives of both detection accuracy and
financial costs of data collection. UAV-based data collection may be a
practical option for supporting electricity access planning strategies for

predominant at long interelectronic separations (hcI ) and the other at short

put forward the most relevant features of this approach and how they can be
used to develop efficient ways to capture electron correlation. We show that
hcI , which only depends on the first-order reduced density matrix, can be used
to identify molecules with a predominant nondynamic correlation regime and
differentiate between two types of nondynamic correlation, types A and B.
Through the asymptotic properties of the hole components, we explain how hcI
can retrieve the long-range part of electron correlation. We perform an
exhaustive analysis of the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis set, dissecting
the hole contributions into spin components. We also analyze the simplest
molecule presenting a dispersion interaction and how hcII helps identify it.
The study of several atoms in different spin states reveals that the Coulomb

This article provides a taxonomy of cognitive concepts and a survey of the

taxonomy comprises the top-level concepts of perception, attention, memory,
cognitive load, reasoning, cognitive biases, knowledge, social cognition,
cognitive control, and errors, and procedures to assess them both qualitatively
and quantitatively. The taxonomy provides a useful tool to filter existing
studies, classify new studies, and support researchers in getting familiar with
a (sub) area. In the literature survey, we systematically collected and
analysed 311 scientific papers spanning five decades and classified them using
the cognitive concepts from the taxonomy. Our analysis shows that the most
developed areas of research correspond to the four life-cycle stages, software
requirements, design, construction, and maintenance. Most research is
quantitative and focuses on knowledge, cognitive load, memory, and reasoning.
Overall, the state of the art appears fragmented when viewed from the
perspective of cognition. There is a lack of use of cognitive concepts that
would represent a coherent picture of the cognitive processes active in
specific tasks. Accordingly, we discuss the research gap in each cognitive
concept and provide recommendations for future research.

require a high number of particles and thus often become computationally
intractable. This is exacerbated in multi-query simulations, where the problem
depends on a set of parameters. In this work, we derive reduced order models
for the semi-discrete Hamiltonian system resulting from a geometric
particle-in-cell approximation of the parametric Vlasov-Poisson equations.
Since the problem's non-dissipative and highly nonlinear nature makes it
reducible only locally in time, we adopt a nonlinear reduced basis approach
where the reduced phase space evolves in time. This strategy allows a
significant reduction in the number of simulated particles, but the evaluation
of the nonlinear operators associated with the Vlasov-Poisson coupling remains
computationally expensive. We propose a novel reduction of the nonlinear terms
that combines adaptive parameter sampling and hyper-reduction techniques to
address this. The proposed approach allows decoupling the operations having a
cost dependent on the number of particles from those that depend on the
instances of the required parameters. In particular, in each time step, the
electric potential is approximated via dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and the
particle-to-grid map via a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM).
These approximations are constructed from data obtained from a past temporal
window at a few selected values of the parameters to guarantee a
computationally efficient adaptation. The resulting DMD-DEIM reduced dynamical
system retains the Hamiltonian structure of the full model, provides good
approximations of the solution, and can be solved at a reduced computational
cost.

application we quantify the statistical stability of time-reversal wave
refocusing through a randomly scattering medium in the paraxial or beam regime.
Time reversal refers to the situation when a transmitted wave field is recorded
on a time-reversal mirror then time reversed and sent back into the complex

We compute the mean of the refocused wave and identify a novel quantitative

a prescribed fraction of particles sequentially ""hops"" to another accelerator

process generates particle number spectra that obey an approximate power law at
mid-range energies and presents low- and high-energy breaks. We analyze these

particles interact with the dense circumstellar material in the North-West
portion of the SNR and radiate GeV gamma-rays through $\pi^{o}$ decay. The
X-ray synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) emission mostly stem from the fast
shocks in the southern regions with a magnetic field B$\sim$100 $\mu$G or
higher. Depending on the exact magnetic field amplitude, the TeV emission could
arise from either the South region (IC dominated) or the interaction region

  Networks: Presentation of the method and demonstration in the Carina Arm
  region","7 pages",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. Several methods have been proposed to build 3D extinction maps of
the Milky Way (MW), most often based on Bayesian approaches. Although some
studies employed machine learning (ML) methods in part of their procedure, or
to specific targets, no 3D extinction map of a large volume of the MW solely
based on a Neural Network method has been reported so far. Aims. We aim to
apply deep learning as a solution to build 3D extinction maps of the MW.
Methods. We built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using the CIANNA
framework, and trained it with synthetic 2MASS data. We used the Besan\c{c}on
Galaxy model to generate mock star catalogs, and 1D Gaussian random fields to
simulate the extinction profiles. From these data we computed color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) to train the network, using the corresponding extinction
profiles as targets. A forward pass with observed 2MASS CMDs provided
extinction profile estimates for a grid of lines of sight. Results. We trained
our network with data simulating lines of sight in the area of the Carina
spiral arm tangent and obtained a 3D extinction map for a large sector in this
region ($l = 257 - 303$ deg, $|b| \le 5$ deg), with distance and angular
resolutions of $100$ pc and $30$ arcmin, respectively, and reaching up to $\sim
10$ kpc. Although each sightline is computed independently in the forward
phase, the so-called fingers-of-God artifacts are weaker than in many other 3D
extinction maps. We found that our CNN was efficient in taking advantage of
redundancy across lines of sight, enabling us to train it with only 9
sightlines simultaneously to build the whole map. Conclusions. We found deep
learning to be a reliable approach to produce 3D extinction maps from large
surveys. With this methodology, we expect to easily combine heterogeneous
surveys without cross-matching, and therefore to exploit several surveys in a
complementary fashion.

in which momentary choices of the system's memories interact in order to source
the internal interactions and unitary time evolutions of the system. In a
closed system of the kind, the unitary evolution operator is updated, moment by
moment, by being remade out of the system's `experience', that is, its quantum
state history. The `Quantum Memory Made' Hamiltonians (QMM-Hs) which generate
these unitary evolutions are Hermitian nonlocal-in-time operators composed of
arbitrarily-chosen past-until-present density operators of the closed system or
its arbitrary subsystems. The time evolutions of the kind are described by
novel nonlocal nonlinear von Neumann and Schr\""odinger equations. We establish
that nontrivial Purely-QMM unitary evolutions are `Robustly Non-Markovian',
meaning that the maximum temporal distances between the chosen quantum memories
must exceed finite lower bounds which are set by the interaction couplings.
After general formulation and considerations, we focus on the
sufficiently-involved task of obtaining and classifying behavioral phases of
one-qubit pure-state evolutions generated by first-to-third order polynomial
QMM-Hs made out of one, two and three quantum memories. The behavioral
attractors resulted from QMM-Hs are characterized and classified using QMM
two-point-function observables as the natural probes, upon combining analytical
methods with extensive numerical analyses. The QMM phase diagrams are shown to
be outstandingly rich, having diverse classes of unprecedented unitary
evolutions with physically remarkable behaviors. Moreover, we show that QMM
interactions cause novel purely-internal dynamical phase transitions. Finally,
we suggest independent fundamental and applied domains where the proposed
`Experience Centric' Unitary Evolutions can be applied natuarlly and
advantageously.

  Code Generation","12 pages, 8 figures, in PACT 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE cs.PF cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Auto-scheduling for tensor programs is a process where a search algorithm
automatically explores candidate schedules (program transformations) for a
given program on a target hardware platform to improve its performance. However
this can be a very time consuming process depending on the complexity of the
tensor program and the capacity of the target device, with often many thousands
of program variants being explored. To address this, in this paper we introduce
the idea of transfer-tuning, a novel approach to identify and reuse
auto-schedules between tensor programs. We demonstrate this concept using Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs), taking sets of auto-schedules from pre-tuned DNNs and
using them to reduce the inference time of a new DNN. We compare
transfer-tuning against the state-of-the-art Ansor auto-scheduler, defining the
maximum possible speedup for a given DNN model as what Ansor achieves using its
recommended full tuning time. On a server-class CPU and across 11 widely used
DNN models, we observe that transfer-tuning achieves up to $88.41\%$ ($49.13\%$
on average) of this maximum speedup, while Ansor requires $6.5\times$ more
search time on average to match it. We also evaluate transfer-tuning on a
constrained edge CPU and observe that the differences in search time are
exacerbated, with Ansor requiring $10.8\times$ more time on average to match
transfer-tuning's speedup, which further demonstrates its value. Our code is

and stellar halos to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the matrix method
of linear response theory. Our computations reproduce the main features of the
dark halo response from simulations. We show that these features can be well
separated by a harmonic decomposition: the large scale over/underdensity in the
halo (associated with its reflex motion) corresponds to the $\ell=1$ terms, and
the local overdensity to the $\ell\geq2$ multipoles. Moreover, the dark halo
response is largely dominated by the first order 'forcing' term, with little
influence from self-gravity. This makes it difficult to constrain the
underlying velocity distribution of the dark halo using the observed response
of the stellar halo, but it allows us to investigate the response of stellar
halo models with various velocity anisotropies: a tangential (respectively
radial) halo produces a shallower (respectively stronger) response. We also
show that only the local wake is responsible for these variations, the reflex
motion being solely dependent on the MW potential. Therefore, we identify the
structure (orientation and winding) of the in-plane quadrupolar ($m=2$)
response as a potentially good probe of the stellar halo anisotropy. Finally,
our method allows us to tentatively relate the wake strength and shape to
resonant effects: the strong radial response could be associated with the inner
Lindblad resonance, and the weak tangential one with corotation.

for the interpretation of biomedical data. Its popularity has led to an
explosion of both enrichment methods and pathway databases. While the elegance
of pathway enrichment lies in its simplicity, multiple factors can impact the
results of such an analysis which may not be accounted for. Researchers may
fail to give influential aspects their due, resorting instead to popular
methods and gene set collections, or default settings. Despite ongoing efforts
to establish set guidelines, meaningful results are still hampered by a lack of
consensus or gold standards around how enrichment analysis should be conducted.
Nonetheless, such concerns have prompted a series of benchmark studies
specifically focused on evaluating the influence of various factors on pathway
enrichment results. In this review, we organize and summarize the findings of
these benchmarks to provide a comprehensive overview on the influence of these
factors. Our work covers a broad spectrum of factors, spanning from
methodological assumptions to those related to prior biological knowledge, such
as pathway definitions and database choice. In doing so, we aim to shed light
on how these aspects can lead to insignificant, uninteresting, or even
contradictory results. Finally, we conclude the review by proposing future

bounded from below. One of the purposes is to establish a sharp comparison
theorem for the bottom spectrum in the spirit of the classical result of Cheng.
Another purpose is to derive volume and other geometric information in terms of
the scalar curvature when the Ricci curvature is asymptotically nonnegative and
the scalar curvature is positive. If the scalar curvature decays no faster than
linearly, then the manifold does not admit any positive Green's function. When
the scalar curvature is bounded from below by a positive constant, it is shown
that the volume of unit balls must be bounded from above by the lower bound of
the scalar curvature at infinity. In particular, in the case that the Ricci
curvature is nonnegative, the volume of the manifold must be of linear growth.
This answers a question of Gromov in the affirmative for dimension three.
Volume estimates are also established for the case when scalar curvature decays
polynomially.

training cost saving is demonstrated from encoder-decoder models (prior works)
to a 5x saving for auto-aggressive language models (this work along with
parallel explorations). However, due to the much larger model size and unique
architecture, how to provide fast MoE model inference remains challenging and
unsolved, limiting its practical usage. To tackle this, we present
DeepSpeed-MoE, an end-to-end MoE training and inference solution as part of the
DeepSpeed library, including novel MoE architecture designs and model
compression techniques that reduce MoE model size by up to 3.7x, and a highly

condense to a cloud around the double helix. The counterions may be localized
outside the macromolecule and inside the minor and major grooves of the double
helix. In the present work, the distribution of condensed counterions between
inner and outer regions of DNA has been studied using the approaches of
counterion condensation theory. The results have shown that the number of
counterions trapped inside the macromolecule should be greater than 0.16 per
one phosphate group. The maximal number of counterions that may be localized
inside the DNA double helix is limited to about 0.4 per one phosphate group and
it is much lower than the total number of condensed counterions. To analyze the
structure of counterion cloud the molecular dynamics simulations of
\emph{B}-DNA with K$^{+}$ counterions have been performed. The obtained number
of the counterions trapped inside the grooves of the double helix is about
0.22$\pm$0.06 per one phosphate group that agree with the model estimations.
The developed model describes general features of the structure of counterion
cloud around DNA and is able to predict the number of counterions inside the
grooves of the double helix.

higher-order statistic of the cosmic shear field that describes the modulation
of the 2-point correlation function $\xi_{\pm}$ by long-wavelength features in
the field. Here, we introduce a new theoretical model to calculate
$\zeta_{\pm}$ that is accurate on small angular scales, and that allows to take
baryonic feedback effects into account. Our model builds on the realization
that the small-scale $\zeta_{\pm}$ is dominated by the nonlinear matter
bispectrum in the squeezed limit, which can be evaluated accurately using the
nonlinear matter power spectrum and its first-order response functions to
density and tidal field perturbations. We demonstrate the accuracy of our model
by showing that it reproduces the small-scale $\zeta_{\pm}$ measured in
simulated cosmic shear maps. The impact of baryonic feedback enters effectively
only through the corresponding impact on the nonlinear matter power spectrum,
thereby permitting to account for these astrophysical effects on $\zeta_{\pm}$
similarly to how they are currently accounted for on $\xi_{\pm}$. Using a
simple idealized Fisher matrix forecast for a DES-like survey we find that,
compared to $\xi_{\pm}$, a combined $\xi_{\pm}\ \&\ \zeta_{\pm}$ analysis can
lead to improvements of order $20-40\%$ on the constraints of cosmological
parameters such as $\sigma_8$ or the dark energy equation of state parameter
$w_0$. We find similar levels of improvement on the constraints of the baryonic
feedback parameters, which strengthens the prospects for cosmic shear data to
obtain tight constraints not only on cosmology but also on astrophysical
feedback models. These are encouraging results that motivate future works on
the integrated shear 3-point correlation function towards applications to real
survey data.

For plates, the bending measure is invariant under spatial dilations and
naturally extends primitive bending strains for straight rods. For shells or
naturally-curved rods, the measure is not dilation invariant, and contrasts
with previous \emph{ad hoc} postulated forms. The corresponding field equations

decoupling of stretching and bending such that application of a pure moment
results in isometric deformation of a unique neutral surface, primitive

inputs? And what do such responses reveal about the learning process? To answer
these questions, we need a clear measure of input simplicity (or inversely,
complexity), an optimization objective that correlates with simplification, and
a framework to incorporate such objective into training and inference. Lastly
we need a variety of testbeds to experiment and evaluate the impact of such
simplification on learning. In this work, we measure simplicity with the
encoding bit size given by a pretrained generative model, and minimize the bit
size to simplify inputs in training and inference. We investigate the effect of
such simplification in several scenarios: conventional training, dataset
condensation and post-hoc explanations. In all settings, inputs are simplified
along with the original classification task, and we investigate the trade-off
between input simplicity and task performance. For images with injected
distractors, such simplification naturally removes superfluous information. For
dataset condensation, we find that inputs can be simplified with almost no
accuracy degradation. When used in post-hoc explanation, our learning-based
simplification approach offers a valuable new tool to explore the basis of
network decisions.

transfer, we searched the APOGEE survey for Be stars with bloated, stripped
companions. From a well-defined parent sample of 297 Be stars, we identified
one mass-transfer binary, HD 15124. The object consists of a main-sequence Be
star ($M_{\rm Be}=5.3\pm 0.6 \,M_{\odot}$) with a low-mass ($M_{\rm
donor}=0.92\pm 0.22\,M_{\odot}$), subgiant companion on a 5.47-day orbit. The
emission lines originate in an accretion disk caused by ongoing mass transfer,
not from a decretion disk as in classical Be stars. Both stars have surface
abundances bearing imprint of CNO processing in the donor's core: the surface
helium fraction is $Y_{\rm He}\approx 0.6$, and the nitrogen-to-carbon ratio is
1000 times the solar value. The system's properties are well-matched by binary
evolution models in which mass transfer begins while a $3-5\,M_{\odot}$ donor
leaves the main sequence, with the secondary becoming the Be star. These models
predict that the system will soon become a detached Be + stripped star binary
like HR 6819 and LB-1, with the stripped donor eventually contracting to become
a core helium-burning sdOB star. Discovery of one object in this short-lived
($\sim$1 Myr) evolutionary phase implies the existence of many more that have
already passed through it and are now Be + sdOB binaries. We infer that
$(28_{-16}^{+27})\,\%$ of Be stars have stripped companions, most of which are
faint. Together with the dearth of main-sequence companions to Be stars and
recent discovery of numerous Be + sdOB binaries in the UV, our results imply
that binarity plays an important role in the formation of Be stars.

190^{\circ}$ have similar spatial locations, metallicities, and kinematics.
Moreover, their locations and kinematics are coincident with several
extraplanar stellar streams. The HVC origins may be connected to the stellar
streams, either stripped directly from them or precipitated by the aggregate
dynamical roiling of the region by the stream progenitors. This paper suggests
that these HVCs are ""misty"" precipitation in the stream wakes based on the
following observations. New high-resolution (2.6 km/s) ultraviolet spectroscopy
of the QSO H1821+643 resolves what appears to be a single HVC absorption cloud
(at 7 km/s resolution) into five components with $T \lesssim 3\times 10^{4}$ K.
Photoionization models can explain the low-ionization components but require
some depletion of refractory elements by dust, and model degeneracies allow a
large range of metallicity. High-ionization absorption lines (SiIV, CIV, and
OVI) are kinematically aligned with the lower-ionization lines and cannot be
easily explained with photoionization or equilibrium collisional ionization;
these lines are best matched by non-equilibrium rapidly cooling models, i.e.,
condensing/precipitating gas, with high metallicity and a significant amount of
HI. Both the low- and high-ionization phases have low ratios of cooling time to
freefall time and cooling time to sound-crossing time, which enables
fragmentation and precipitation. The H1821+643 results are corroborated by
spectroscopy of six other nearby targets that likewise show kinematically
correlated low- and high-ionization absorption lines with evidence of dust
depletion and rapid cooling.

regulates the fraction of mass contained in the discs around the binary

with an overview of the microphysical model and analytic scaling relations of
macroscopic properties derived from the non-relativistic limit. We use the full
relativistic formalism to confirm these scaling relations and demonstrate that
dark white dwarfs, if they exist, would have masses and tidal deformabilities
that are very different from those of baryonic compact objects. Further, and
most importantly, we demonstrate that dark white dwarf mergers would be
detectable by current or planned gravitational observatories across several
orders of magnitude in the particle-mass parameter space. Lastly, we find
universal relations analogous to the compactness-Love and binary Love relations
in neutron star literature. Using these results, we show that gravitational

products, services and companies. In case of machine learning (ML)
applications, this necessitates deletion of data not only from storage archives
but also from ML models. Due to an increasing need for regulatory compliance
required for ML applications, machine unlearning is becoming an emerging
research problem. The right to be forgotten requests come in the form of
removal of a certain set or class of data from the already trained ML model.
Practical considerations preclude retraining of the model from scratch after
discarding the deleted data. The few existing studies use either the whole
training data, or a subset of training data, or some metadata stored during
training to update the model weights for unlearning. However, in many cases, no
data related to the training process or training samples may be accessible for
the unlearning purpose. We therefore ask the question: is it possible to
achieve unlearning with zero training samples? In this paper, we introduce the
novel problem of zero-shot machine unlearning that caters for the extreme but
practical scenario where zero original data samples are available for use. We
then propose two novel solutions for zero-shot machine unlearning based on (a)
error minimizing-maximizing noise and (b) gated knowledge transfer. These
methods remove the information of the forget data from the model while
maintaining the model efficacy on the retain data. The zero-shot approach
offers good protection against the model inversion attacks and membership
inference attacks. We introduce a new evaluation metric, Anamnesis Index (AIN)
to effectively measure the quality of the unlearning method. The experiments
show promising results for unlearning in deep learning models on benchmark

is produced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the early Universe,
induced by a nonhelical primordial magnetic field at the energy scale
corresponding to the quark confinement phase transition. We perform MHD
simulations to study the dynamical evolution of the magnetic field and compute
the resulting SGWB. We show that the SGWB output from the simulations can be
very well approximated by assuming that the magnetic anisotropic stress is
constant in time, over a time interval related to the eddy turnover time. The
analytical spectrum that we derive under this assumption features a change of
slope at a frequency corresponding to the GW source duration that we confirm
with the numerical simulations. We compare the SGWB signal with the PTA data to
constrain the temperature scale at which the SGWB is sourced, as well as the
amplitude and characteristic scale of the initial magnetic field. We find that
the generation temperature is constrained to be in the 1--200 MeV range, the
magnetic field amplitude must be $>1$\% of the radiation energy density at that
time, and the magnetic field characteristic scale is constrained to be $>10$\%
of the horizon scale. We show that the turbulent decay of this magnetic field

astrophysical sources have been recently reported, but a conclusive
identification of these potential neutrino emitters remains challenging. We
explore the use of Monte Carlo simulations of source populations to gain deeper
insight into the physical implications of proposed individual source--neutrino
associations. In particular, we focus on the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056
observation. Assuming a null model, we find a 7.6\% chance of mistakenly
identifying coincidences between $\gamma$-ray flares from blazars and neutrino
alerts in 10-year surveys. We confirm that a blazar--neutrino connection based
on the $\gamma$-ray flux is required to find a low chance coincidence
probability and, therefore, a significant IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association.
We then assume this blazar--neutrino connection for the whole population and
find that the ratio of neutrino to $\gamma$-ray fluxes must be $\lesssim
10^{-2}$ in order not to overproduce the total number of neutrino alerts seen
by IceCube. For the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association to make sense, we must
either accept this low flux ratio or suppose that only some rare sub-population
of blazars is capable of high-energy neutrino production. For example, if we
consider neutrino production only in blazar flares, we expect the flux ratio of
between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-1}$ to be consistent with a single coincident
observation of a neutrino alert and flaring $\gamma$-ray blazar. These
constraints should be interpreted in the context of the likelihood models used
to find the IC170922A--TXS~0506+056 association, which assumes a fixed
power-law neutrino spectrum of $E^{-2.13}$ for all blazars.

each sample has values for all of the features at that given time. This allows
one to both impute fully missing observations to allow uniform time series
classification across the entire data and, in special cases, to impute
individually missing features. To do so, we slightly generalize the well-known
class imbalance algorithm SMOTE \cite{smote} to allow component wise nearest
neighbor interpolation that preserves correlations when there are no missing
features. We visualize the method in the simplified setting of 2-dimensional
uncoupled harmonic oscillators. Next, we use tSMOTE to train an Encoder/Decoder
long-short term memory (LSTM) model with Logistic Regression for predicting and
classifying distinct trajectories of different 2D oscillators. After
illustrating the the utility of tSMOTE in this context, we use the same
architecture to train a clinical model for COVID-19 disease severity on an

implement experimentally an automated adaptive optimization protocol to
engineer photonic Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) states. The protocol, given a
target output state, performs an online estimation of the quality of the
currently produced states, relying on output measurement statistics, and
determines how to tune the experimental parameters to optimize the state
generation. To achieve this, the algorithm needs not be imbued with a
description of the generation apparatus itself. Rather, it operates in a fully
black-box scenario, making the scheme applicable in a wide variety of
circumstances. The handles controlled by the algorithm are the rotation angles
of a series of waveplates and can be used to probabilistically generate
arbitrary four-dimensional OAM states. We showcase our scheme on different
target states both in classical and quantum regimes, and prove its robustness

Although land elevation is the product of many complex processes, the
large-scale topographic features on any geodynamically-active planet are the
expression of the convecting mantle beneath the surface. This so-called
""dynamic topography"" exists regardless of a planet's tectonic regime or
volcanism; its amplitude, with a few assumptions, can be estimated via
numerical simulations of convection as a function of the mantle Rayleigh
number. We develop new scaling relationships for dynamic topography on stagnant
lid planets using 2D convection models with temperature-dependent viscosity.
These scalings are applied to 1D thermal history models to explore how dynamic
topography varies with exoplanetary observables over a wide parameter space.
Dynamic topography amplitudes are converted to an ocean basin capacity, the
minimum water volume required to flood the entire surface. Basin capacity
increases less steeply with planet mass than does the amount of water itself,
assuming a water inventory that is a constant planetary mass fraction. We find
that dynamically-supported topography alone could be sufficient to maintain
subaerial land on Earth-size stagnant lid planets with surface water
inventories of up to approximately $10^{-4}$ times their mass, in the most
favourable thermal states. By considering only dynamic topography, which has
~1-km amplitudes on Earth, these results represent a lower limit to the true
ocean basin capacity. Our work indicates that deterministic geophysical

overlooked topic in combustion. Typically, the role of two-phase dynamics is
neglected under the assumption that the liquid rapidly transitions to a
supercritical state. However, a transcritical domain exists where a sharp phase
interface remains. This scenario is the common case in the early times of
liquid fuel injection under real-engine conditions involving hydrocarbon fuels.
Under such conditions, the dissolution of the oxidizer species into the liquid
phase is accelerated due to local thermodynamic phase equilibrium (LTE) and
vaporization or condensation can occur at multiple locations along the
interface at the same time. Fluid properties vary under species and thermal
mixing, with similar liquid and gas mixtures near the interface. As a result of
the combination of low, varying surface-tension force and gas-like liquid
viscosities, small surface instabilities develop early. The mixing process,
interface thermodynamics, and early deformation of a cool liquid n-decane jet
surrounded by a hotter moving gas initially composed of pure oxygen are
analyzed at various ambient pressures and gas velocities. A two-phase,
low-Mach-number flow solver for variable-density fluids is used. The interface
is captured using a split Volume-of-Fluid method, generalized for a
non-divergence-free liquid velocity and mass exchange across the interface. The
importance of transcritical mixing effects over time for increasing pressures
is shown. Initially, local deformation features differ considerably from
previous incompressible works. Then, the minimal surface-tension force is
responsible for the generation of overlapping liquid layers in favor of the
classical atomization into droplets. Thus, surface-area growth at transcritical
conditions is mainly a consequence of gas-like deformations under shear rather
than spray formation.

requires good knowledge of both the gravitational and the astrophysical
conditions near the black hole. When the geometrical properties of the black
hole are well understood, extracting information on the emission properties is
possible. Similarly, when the emission properties are well understood,
extracting information on the black-hole geometry is possible. At present
however, uncertainties are present both in the geometry and in the emission,
and this inevitably leads to degeneracies in the interpretation of the
observations. We explore here the impact of varying geometry and emission
coefficient when modelling the imaging of a spherically-accreting black hole.
Adopting the Rezzolla-Zhidenko parametric metric to model arbitrary static
black-holes, we first demonstrate how shadow-size measurements leave
degeneracies in the multidimensional space of metric-deviation parameters, even
in the limit of infinite-precision measurements. Then, at finite precision, we
show that these degenerate regions can be constrained when multiple pieces of
information, such as the shadow-size and the peak image intensity contrast, are
combined. Such degeneracies can potentially be eliminated with measurements at
increased angular-resolution and flux-sensitivity. While our approach is
restricted to spherical symmetry and hence idealised, we expect our results to
hold also when more complex geometries and emission processes are considered.

within the deep sea (e.g. fisheries, oil-gas extraction, and mining) urgently
imposes the development of novel monitoring technologies, beyond the
traditional vessel-assisted, time-consuming, high-cost sampling surveys. The
implementation of permanent networks of seabed and water-column cabled (fixed)
and docked mobile platforms is presently enforced, to cooperatively measure
biological features and environmental (physico-chemical) parameters. Video and
acoustic (i.e. optoacoustic) imaging are becoming central approaches for
studying benthic fauna (e.g. quantifying species presence, behaviour, and
trophic interactions) in a remote, continuous, and prolonged fashion. Imaging
is also being complemented by in situ environmental-DNA sequencing
technologies, allowing the traceability of a wide range of organisms (including
prokaryotes) beyond the reach of optoacoustic tools. Here, we describe the
different fixed and mobile platforms of those benthic and pelagic monitoring
networks, proposing at the same time an innovative roadmap for the automated
computing of hierarchical ecological information of deep-sea ecosystems (i.e.
from single species abundance and life traits, to community composition, and
overall biodiversity)

  Systems",,,,"physics.flu-dyn math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Microchannels are well-known in microfluidic applications for the control and
separation of microdroplets and cells. Often the objects in the flow experience
inertial effects, resulting in dynamics that is a departure from the underlying
channel flow dynamics. This paper considers small neutrally buoyant spherical
particles suspended in flow through a curved duct having a square
cross-section. The particle experiences a combination of inertial lift force
induced by the disturbance from the primary flow along the duct, and drag from
the secondary vortices in the cross-section, which drive migration of the
particle within the cross-section. We construct a simplified model that
preserves the core topology of the force field yet depends on a single
parameter $\kappa$, quantifying the relative strength of the two forces. We
show that $\kappa$ is a bifurcation parameter for the dynamical system that
describes motion of the particle in the cross section of the duct. At large
values of $\kappa$ there exists an attracting limit cycle, in each of the upper
and lower halves of the duct. At small $\kappa$ we find that particles migrate
to one of four stable foci. Between these extremes, there is an
intermediate-range of $\kappa$ for which all particles migrate to a single
stable focus. Noting that the positions of the limit cycles and foci vary with
the value of $\kappa$, this behavior indicates that, for a suitable particle
mixture, duct bend radius might be chosen to segregate particles by size. We
evaluate the time and axial distance required to focus particles near the
unique stable node, which determines the duct length required for particle
segregation.

  Estimating Ranking Performance","9 pages, work done in 2019, revised in 2021",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Conducting a systematic review (SR) is comprised of multiple tasks: (i)
collect documents (studies) that are likely to be relevant from digital
libraries (eg., PubMed), (ii) manually read and label the documents as relevant
or irrelevant, (iii) extract information from the relevant studies, and (iv)
analyze and synthesize the information and derive a conclusion of SR. When
researchers label studies, they can screen ranked documents where relevant
documents are higher than irrelevant ones. This practice, known as screening
prioritization (ie., document ranking approach), speeds up the process of
conducting a SR as the documents labelled as relevant can move to the next
tasks earlier. However, the approach is limited in reducing the manual workload
because the total number of documents to screen remains the same. Towards
reducing the manual workload in the screening process, we investigate the
quality of document ranking of SR. This can signal researchers whereabouts in
the ranking relevant studies are located and let them decide where to stop the
screening. After extensive analysis on SR document rankings from different
ranking models, we hypothesize 'topic broadness' as a factor that affects the
ranking quality of SR. Finally, we propose a measure that estimates the topic
broadness and demonstrate that the proposed measure is a simple yet effective
method to predict the qualities of document rankings for SRs.

to perform a domain transfer and thus convert data from new sources into the

in higher quality segmentations. We achieve the disentanglement with the

  Video Lectures",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Predicting contextualised engagement in videos is a long-standing problem
that has been popularly attempted by exploiting the number of views or the
associated likes using different computational methods. The recent decade has
seen a boom in online learning resources, and during the pandemic, there has
been an exponential rise of online teaching videos without much quality
control. The quality of the content could be improved if the creators could get
constructive feedback on their content. Employing an army of domain expert
volunteers to provide feedback on the videos might not scale. As a result,
there has been a steep rise in developing computational methods to predict a
user engagement score that is indicative of some form of possible user
engagement, i.e., to what level a user would tend to engage with the content. A
drawback in current methods is that they model various features separately, in
a cascaded approach, that is prone to error propagation. Besides, most of them
do not provide crucial explanations on how the creator could improve their
content. In this paper, we have proposed a new unified model, CLUE for the
educational domain, which learns from the features extracted from freely
available public online teaching videos and provides explainable feedback on
the video along with a user engagement score. Given the complexity of the task,
our unified framework employs different pre-trained models working together as
an ensemble of classifiers. Our model exploits various multi-modal features to
model the complexity of language, context agnostic information, textual emotion
of the delivered content, animation, speaker's pitch and speech emotions. Under
a transfer learning setup, the overall model, in the unified space, is
fine-tuned for downstream applications.

Majorana fermions acquire masses via a type II seesaw mechanism in which the
physical eigenstates are identified as a light Majorana fermion and another
heavy Majorana fermion. On a physical basis, the quartic self-couplings involve
axial currents of these Majorana fermions, and also the interaction of the
axial current for the light particle with the heavy particle one. We introduce
two auxiliaries gauge fields in this model, and we study the stability
conditions of the correspondent effective potential of the model. The ground
state of the effective potential introduces two 4-vectors as scales of vacuum
expected values, and consequently, the dynamical Lorentz symmetry breaking
(DLSB) emerges in the model. We use the expansion of the effective action to
calculate the effective Lagrangian up to second order in the auxiliary fields
as fluctuations around the ground state. This mechanism generates dynamics for
the auxiliary gauge fields, mixed mass terms, longitudinal propagation, and
Chern-Simons term through radiative corrections. After the diagonalization, the
two gauge fields gain masses through an analogous type II seesaw mechanism in
which a gauge boson has a light mass, and the other one acquires a heavy mass.
In this scenario of Lorentz symmetry breaking, we obtain the correspondent
dispersion relations for the Majorana fermions and the gauge boson fields.
Posteriorly, we analyze the neutrino's oscillations in the presence of a DLSB
parameter, in the transition $\nu_{e} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$. We discuss the
parameter space of this transition and show that the DLSB can conciliate the
LSND and super-Kamiokande results.

matrix and the error precision (inverse covariance) matrix for high-dimensional
multivariate regression models in the Bayesian paradigm. The selected sparsity
patterns are crucial to help understand the network of relationships between
the predictor and response variables, as well as the conditional relationships
among the latter. While Bayesian methods have the advantage of providing
natural uncertainty quantification through posterior inclusion probabilities
and credible intervals, current Bayesian approaches either restrict to specific
sub-classes of sparsity patterns and/or are not scalable to settings with
hundreds of responses and predictors. Bayesian approaches which only focus on
estimating the posterior mode are scalable, but do not generate samples from
the posterior distribution for uncertainty quantification. Using a bi-convex
regression based generalized likelihood and spike-and-slab priors, we develop
an algorithm called Joint Regression Network Selector (JRNS) for joint
regression and covariance selection which (a) can accommodate general sparsity
patterns, (b) provides posterior samples for uncertainty quantification, and
(c) is scalable and orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art
Bayesian approaches providing uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate the
statistical and computational efficacy of the proposed approach on synthetic
data and through the analysis of selected cancer data sets. We also establish
high-dimensional posterior consistency for one of the developed algorithms.

as emissivity. Tuning the emissivity of surfaces has been of great interest in
many applications involving thermal radiation such as thermophotovoltaics,
thermal management systems, and passive radiative cooling. Although several
surface engineering techniques (e.g., surface functionalization) have been
pursued to alter the emissivity, there exists a knowledge gap in precisely
predicting the emissivity of a surface prior to the modification/fabrication
process. Predicting emissivity by a physics-based modeling approach is
challenging due to surface's contributing factors, complex interactions and
interdependence, and measuring the emissivity requires a tedious procedure for
every sample. Thus, a new approach is much-needed to systematically predict the
emissivity and expand the applications of thermal radiation. In this work, we
demonstrate the immense advantage of employing artificial intelligence (AI)
techniques to predict the emissivity of complex surfaces. For this aim, we
fabricated 116 bulk aluminum 6061 samples with various surface characteristics
using femtosecond laser surface processing (FLSP). A comprehensive dataset was
established by collecting surface characteristic data, laser operating
parameters, and measured emissivities for all samples. We demonstrated the
application of AI in two distinct scenarios. First, the range of emissivity of
an unknown sample was shown to be estimated correctly solely based on its 3D
surface morphology image. Second, the emissivity of a sample was precisely
predicted based on its surface characteristics data and fabrication parameters.
The implementation of the AI techniques resulted in the highly accurate
prediction of emissivity by showing excellent agreement with the measurements.

depending on the assigned duty. The current solution to authenticate a single

The first step covers the authentication between a drone and the 5G core

with the current solution without causing a significant latency.
  Authentication keys between a base station (BS) and a user equipment (UE)
must be shared with the new BS while performing handover. The drone swarms are
heavily mobile and require several handovers from BS to a new BS. Sharing
authentication keys for each drone as explained in 5G NR is not scalable for

only a single classical ab initio molecular dynamics trajectory, in addition to

weakening the assumption, such as exact search methods with well-defined score

several strategies to improve the scalability of exact score-based methods in

requires assumptions that are strictly weaker than faithfulness, and apply it
to restrict the search space of exact search. We also propose a local search

experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed procedure, and demonstrate
that it scales up to hundreds of nodes with a high accuracy.

electron-temperature gradient are considered in a local slab model of a
tokamak-like plasma. The model describes perturbations at scales both larger
and smaller than the flux-freezing scale $d_e$, and so captures both
electrostatic and EM regimes of turbulence. The well-known electrostatic
instabilities -- slab and curvature-mediated ETG -- are recovered, and a new
instability is found in the EM regime, called the Thermo-Alfv\'enic instability
(TAI). It exists in both a slab version (sTAI, destabilising kinetic Alfv\'en
waves) and a curvature-mediated version (cTAI), which is a cousin of the
(electron-scale) kinetic ballooning mode (KBM). The cTAI turns out to be
dominant at the largest scales covered by the model (greater than $d_e$ but
smaller than $\rho_i$), its physical mechanism hinging on the fast equalisation
of the total temperature along perturbed magnetic field lines (in contrast to
KBM, which is pressure balanced). A turbulent cascade theory is then
constructed, with two energy-injection scales: $d_e$, where the drivers are
slab ETG and sTAI, and a larger (parallel system size dependent) scale, where
the driver is cTAI. The latter dominates the turbulent transport if the
temperature gradient is greater than a certain critical value, which scales
inversely with the electron beta. The resulting heat flux scales more steeply
with the temperature gradient than that due to electrostatic ETG turbulence,
giving rise to stiffer transport. This can be viewed as a physical argument in
favour of near-marginal steady-state in electron-transport-controlled plasmas
(e.g., the pedestal). While the model is simplistic, the new physics that is
revealed by it should be of interest to those attempting to model the effect of
EM turbulence in tokamak-relevant configurations with high beta and large
electron temperature gradients.

algorithm that computes edge connectivity with $O(n)$ cut queries, and (ii)
there is a bounded-error quantum algorithm that computes edge connectivity with
$\~O(\sqrt{n})$ cut queries. We prove these results using a new technique
called ""star contraction"" to randomly contract edges of a graph while
preserving non-trivial minimum cuts. In star contraction vertices randomly
contract an edge incident on a small set of randomly chosen vertices. In
contrast to the related 2-out contraction technique of Ghaffari, Nowicki, and
Thorup [SODA'20], star contraction only contracts vertex-disjoint star
subgraphs, which allows it to be efficiently implemented via cut queries.
  The $O(n)$ bound from item (i) was not known even for the simpler problem of
connectivity, and improves the $O(n\log^3 n)$ bound by Rubinstein, Schramm, and
Weinberg [ITCS'18]. The bound is tight under the reasonable conjecture that the
randomized communication complexity of connectivity is $\Omega(n\log n)$, an
open question since the seminal work of Babai, Frankl, and Simon [FOCS'86]. The
bound also excludes using edge connectivity on simple graphs to prove a
superlinear randomized query lower bound for minimizing a symmetric submodular
function. Item (ii) gives a nearly-quadratic separation with the randomized
complexity and addresses an open question of Lee, Santha, and Zhang [SODA'21].
The algorithm can also be viewed as making $\~O(\sqrt{n})$ matrix-vector
multiplication queries to the adjacency matrix.
  Finally, we demonstrate the use of star contraction outside of the cut query
setting by designing a one-pass semi-streaming algorithm for computing edge
connectivity in the vertex arrival setting. This contrasts with the edge
arrival setting where two passes are required.

code, the most general lattice surgery operations require lattice
irregularities called twist defects. However, implementing twist-based lattice
surgery may require additional resources, such as extra device connectivity,
and could lower the threshold and overall performance for the surface code.
Here we provide an explicit twist-based lattice surgery protocol and its
requisite connectivity layout. We also provide new stabilizer measurement
circuits for measuring twist defects which are compatible with our chosen gate
scheduling. We undertake the first circuit-level error correction simulations
during twist-based lattice surgery using a biased depolarizing noise model. Our
results indicate a slight decrease in the threshold for timelike logical
failures compared to lattice surgery protocols with no twist defects in the
bulk. However, comfortably below threshold (i.e. with CNOT infidelities below
$5 \times 10^{-3}$), the performance degradation is mild and in fact preferable
over proposed alternative twist-free schemes. Lastly, we provide an efficient
scheme for measuring $Y$ operators along boundaries of surface codes which
bypasses certain steps that were required in previous schemes.

interaction mediated by the intracavity field of a microwave cavity, along with
their testable ramifications. In general, we foreground two widely dissimilar
parameter domains that bring forth the contrasting possibilities of level
splitting and level crossing. The former is observed in the regime of strong
magnon-photon couplings, particularly when the three modes bear comparable
relaxation rates. This character is marked by the appearance of three
distinguishable and non-converging polariton branches in the spectral response
to a cavity drive. However, when the bare modes are resonant and the couplings
perfectly symmetrical, one of the spectral peaks gets wiped out. This anomalous
extinction of polaritonic response can be traced down to the existence of a
conspicuous dark mode alongside two frequency-shifted bright modes. In an
alternate parameter regime, where the magnon modes are weakly coupled to the
cavity, features of level attraction unfold, subject to a large relaxation rate
for the cavity mode. Concurrently, for antisymmetric detunings to the magnon
modes, a transmission window springs into existence, exhibiting transparency in
the limit of negligible dissipation from the magnons. The emergence of level
attraction can be reconciled with a theoretical model that embodies the
dynamics of the magnon-magnon subsystem when the cavity field decays rapidly
into its steady state. In this limit, we identify a purely dissipative coupling
between the magnon modes.

quasiconvexity, an old but not so well-known property weaker than convexity but
stronger than quasiconvexity. A detailed discussion on natural quasiconvexity
is still missing and this paper aims to fill this gap in the setting of
conditional risk measures. We relate natural quasiconvexity to additively
decomposable sums. The notion of convexity index, defined in 1980s for
finite-dimensional vector spaces, plays a crucial role in the discussion of
decomposable sums. We propose a general treatment of convexity index in
topological vector spaces and use it to study naturally quasiconvex risk
measures. We prove that natural quasiconvexity and convexity are equivalent for
conditional risk measures on $L^p$ spaces, $p \geq 1$, under mild continuity
and locality conditions. Finally, we discuss an alternative notion of locality
with respect to an orthonormal basis in $L^2$.

method is one such effective and robust symbolic representation, demonstrated
to accurately capture important trends and shapes in time series. However, in
its current form the method struggles to process very large time series. Here
we present a new variant of the ABBA method, called fABBA. This variant
utilizes a new aggregation approach tailored to the piecewise representation of

sorting-based aggregation technique, and thereby avoiding repeated
sum-of-squares error computations, the computational complexity is
significantly reduced. In contrast to the original method, the new approach
does not require the number of time series symbols to be specified in advance.
Through extensive tests we demonstrate that the new method significantly
outperforms ABBA with a considerable reduction in runtime while also
outperforming the popular SAX and 1d-SAX representations in terms of
reconstruction accuracy. We further demonstrate that fABBA can compress other

method achieves highly accurate estimations of the diffusion tensor and is
significantly superior to three competing methods. Estimations produced by our

produce individually labeled particle interactions within the image. These
outputs are identified as either cosmic ray muon or electron neutrino
interactions. We find that sMask-RCNN has an average pixel clustering

conjunction with MicroBooNE's state-of-the-art Wire-Cell cosmic tagger to veto
events containing only cosmic ray muons. The addition of sMask-RCNN to the
Wire-Cell cosmic tagger removes 70% of the remaining cosmic ray muon background
events at the same electron neutrino event signal efficiency. This event veto
can provide 99.7% rejection of cosmic ray-only background events while
maintaining an electron neutrino event-level signal efficiency of 80.1%. In
addition to cosmic ray muon identification, sMask-RCNN could be used to extract
features and identify different particle interaction types in other 3D-tracking
detectors.

learning. The proposed layer can learn homography, therefore reflecting the
geometric positions between observers and objects. In addition, by directly
training its transformation matrices, a single proposed layer can learn an
adjustable number of multiple viewpoints without considering module parameters.
The experiments and evaluations confirm the superiority of the proposed layer.

a membrane region, and an ionic solvent region as well as an interface fitted

these meshes is very difficult and highly technical due to the related three
regions having very complex geometrical shapes. Currently, an ion channel mesh
generation software package developed in Lu's research group is one available

performance, in this paper, new numerical schemes for generating membrane and

to demonstrate the efficiency of the new numerical schemes and the quality of
meshes generated by the new package for ion channel proteins with ion channel

quantile-based direct approaches as well as generalizing mean-based approaches.
Expectiles are new risk measures in hydrology. Compared to quantiles that use
information of the frequency of process realizations over a specified value,
expectiles use additional information of the magnitude of the exceedances over
the specified value. Expectiles are least square analogues of quantiles and can
characterize the probability distribution in much the same way as quantiles do.
Moreover, the mean of the probability distribution is the special case of the
expectile at level 0.5. To this end, we propose calibrating hydrological models
using the expectile loss function, which is strictly consistent for expectiles.
We apply our method to 511 basins in contiguous US and deliver predictive
expectiles of hydrological simulations with the GR4J, GR5J and GR6J

in learning models of unknown continuous-time dynamical systems from data.
However, every forward evaluation of a NODE requires numerical integration of
the neural network used to capture the system dynamics, making their training
prohibitively expensive. Existing works rely on off-the-shelf adaptive
step-size numerical integration schemes, which often require an excessive
number of evaluations of the underlying dynamics network to obtain sufficient
accuracy for training. By contrast, we accelerate the evaluation and the
training of NODEs by proposing a data-driven approach to their numerical
integration. The proposed Taylor-Lagrange NODEs (TL-NODEs) use a fixed-order
Taylor expansion for numerical integration, while also learning to estimate the
expansion's approximation error. As a result, the proposed approach achieves
the same accuracy as adaptive step-size schemes while employing only low-order
Taylor expansions, thus greatly reducing the computational cost necessary to
integrate the NODE. A suite of numerical experiments, including modeling
dynamical systems, image classification, and density estimation, demonstrate
that TL-NODEs can be trained more than an order of magnitude faster than
state-of-the-art approaches, without any loss in performance.

suffer from temporal and semantic inconsistency. To address this, many existing
works adopt spatiotemporal consistency constraints incorporating temporal
information based on motion estimation. However, the inaccuracies in the
estimation of motion deteriorate the quality of the guidance towards
spatiotemporal consistency, which leads to unstable translation. In this work,
we propose a novel paradigm that regularizes the spatiotemporal consistency by
synthesizing motions in input videos with the generated optical flow instead of
estimating them. Therefore, the synthetic motion can be applied in the
regularization paradigm to keep motions consistent across domains without the
risk of errors in motion estimation. Thereafter, we utilize our unsupervised

provided by the synthetic optical flow, to accurately enforce spatiotemporal

when compared to steady flows. Here, we study experimentally the influence of
the amplitude of pulsation $0.25\,P_0 \leq \delta P \leq 1.25\,P_0$, where
$P_0$ is the mean pressure, and of the frequency of pulsation $10^{-3}\,{\rm
Hz} \leq f \leq 10^{-1}\,{\rm Hz}$ on clog mitigation in a microfluidic array
of parallel channels using a dilute suspension of colloidal particles. The
array geometry is representative of a classical filter, with parallel pores
that clog over time, yielding a filter cake that continues to grow and can
interact with other pores. We combine flow rate measurements with direct
visualizations at the pore scale to correlate the observed clogging dynamics
with the changes in flow rate. We observe that all pulsatile amplitudes at
$0.1$ Hz yield increased throughput compared to steady flows. The rearrangement
of particles when subject to a dynamic shear environment can delay the clogging
of a pore or even remove an existing clog. However, this benefit is drastically
reduced at $10^{-2}$ Hz and disappears at $10^{-3}$ Hz as the pulsatile
timescale becomes too large compared to the timescale associated with the
clogging and the growth of the filter cakes in this system. The present study
demonstrates that pulsatile flows are a promising method to delay clogging at
both the pore and system scale.

the Dynamic Bandwidth Channel Access (DBCA) mechanism. By applying DBCA, a
wireless station can select a wider channel bandwidth, such as 40/80/160 MHz,
by applying the channel bonding feature. However, during channel bonding,
inappropriate bandwidth selection can cause collisions. Therefore, to avoid
collisions, a well-developed media access control (MAC) protocol is crucial to
effectively utilize the channel bonding mechanism. In this paper, we address a
collision scenario, called Outside Warning Range Problem (OWRP), that may occur
during DBCA when a wireless station interferes with another wireless station
after channel bonding is performed. Therefore, we propose a MAC layer
mechanism, Intelligent Bonding Avoiding Collision (IBAC), that adapts the
channel bonding level in DBCA in order to avoid the OWRP. We first design a
theoretical model based on Markov chains for DBCA while avoiding the OWRP.
Based on this model, we design a Thompson sampling based Bayesian approach to
select the best possible channel bonding level intelligently. We analyze the
performance of the IBAC through simulations where it is observed that,
comparing to other competing mechanisms, the proposed approach can enhance the
network performance significantly while avoiding the OWRP.

approaches ignore the feature correlations, i.e., feature inconsistencies,
between manipulated regions and non-manipulated regions, leading to inferior
detection performance. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical Graph
Convolutional Network (HGCN-Net), which consists of two parallel branches: the
backbone network branch and the hierarchical graph representation learning
(HGRL) branch for image manipulation detection. Specifically, the feature maps
of a given image are extracted by the backbone network branch, and then the
feature correlations within the feature maps are modeled as a set of
fully-connected graphs for learning the hierarchical graph representation by
the HGRL branch. The learned hierarchical graph representation can sufficiently
capture the feature correlations across different scales, and thus it provides
high discriminability for distinguishing manipulated and non-manipulated
regions. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that the
proposed HGCN-Net not only provides promising detection accuracy, but also
achieves strong robustness under a variety of common image attacks in the task

Method: Antisymmetrized molecular dynamics with Gogny D1S density functional is
applied to describe the shape coexistence phenomena without ad hoc assumption

infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes (MDPs). The involved
variance metric concerns reward variability during the whole process, and
future deviations are discounted to their present values. This discounted
mean-variance optimization yields a reward function dependent on a discounted
mean, and this dependency renders traditional dynamic programming methods
inapplicable since it suppresses a crucial property -- time consistency. To
deal with this unorthodox problem, we introduce a pseudo mean to transform the
untreatable MDP to a standard one with a redefined reward function in standard
form and derive a discounted mean-variance performance difference formula. With
the pseudo mean, we propose a unified algorithm framework with a bilevel
optimization structure for the discounted mean-variance optimization. The
framework unifies a variety of algorithms for several variance-related problems
including, but not limited to, risk-averse variance and mean-variance
optimizations in discounted and average MDPs. Furthermore, the convergence
analyses missing from the literature can be complemented with the proposed
framework as well. Taking the value iteration as an example, we develop a
discounted mean-variance value iteration algorithm and prove its convergence to
a local optimum with the aid of a Bellman local-optimality equation. Finally,

Real-World Graph Convolution Networks (RW-GCNs), an architecture-level solution
for meeting the domain constraints of Real World Skeleton-based Action
Recognition. Inspired by the presence of feedback connections in the human
visual cortex, RW-GCNs leverage attentive feedback augmentation on existing
near state-of-the-art (SotA) Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Networks

achieving 32X less latency than baseline ST-GCN applications while still
achieving 90.4% accuracy on the Northwestern UCLA dataset in the presence of

restated in the streaming context, which can then be addressed using streaming
solvers. However, a streaming solver's benefits can only be realized if it can
be appropriately tracked and stopped -- otherwise, the algorithm may stop
before the desired accuracy is achieved, or it may run longer than necessary.
Unfortunately, streaming solvers cannot access the residual norm, which is the
traditional metric of progress. While streaming solvers have access to noisy
estimates of the residual, such estimates need uncertainty sets to quantify
their utility and reflect a user's risk preferences. Thus, in this work, we
rigorously develop computationally-practical residual estimators and their

PTMs' own ability with quantities of implicit knowledge stored in parameters. A
recent study has observed knowledge neurons in the Feed Forward Network (FFN),
which are responsible for expressing factual knowledge. In this work, we
propose a simple model, Kformer, which takes advantage of the knowledge stored
in PTMs and external knowledge via knowledge injection in Transformer FFN
layers. Empirically results on two knowledge-intensive tasks, commonsense
reasoning (i.e., SocialIQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE),
demonstrate that Kformer can yield better performance than other knowledge
injection technologies such as concatenation or attention-based injection. We
think the proposed simple model and empirical findings may be helpful for the
community to develop more powerful knowledge injection methods. Code available

other workers to form a network and the task requester only connects to some of
the workers. The goal is to design an allocation mechanism such that each
worker is incentivized to invite her neighbours to join the allocation,
although they are competing for the task. Moreover, the performance of each
worker is uncertain, which is modelled as the quality level of her task
execution. The literature has proposed solutions to tackle the uncertainty
problem by paying them after verifying their execution. Here, we extend the
problem to the network setting. The challenge is that the requester relies on
the workers to invite each other to find the best worker, and the performance
of each worker is also unknown to the task requester. In this paper, we propose
a new mechanism to solve the two challenges at the same time. The mechanism
guarantees that inviting more workers and reporting/performing according to her
true ability is a dominant strategy for each worker. We believe that the new
solution can be widely applied in the digital economy powered by social

transport framework, Deep Optimal Transport (DOT), for general computation,
using the generalized joint distribution adaptation approach and the existing
Riemannian-based network architectures on SPD manifolds. DOT is applied to the
real-world scenario and becomes a specific EEG-BCI classifier against the
cross-session motor-imagery classification from the calibration phase to the

Despite their diverse dynamic properties, NRNs share the signature
characteristics of persistent probability fluxes and continuous energy
dissipation even in the steady state. Dynamics of NRNs can be described at
different coarse-grained levels. Our previous work showed that the apparent
energy dissipation rate at a coarse-grained level follows an inverse power law
dependence on the scale of coarse-graining. The scaling exponent is determined
by the network structure and correlation of stationary probability fluxes.
However, it remains unclear whether and how the (renormalized) flux correlation
varies with coarse-graining. Following Kadanoff's real space renormalization
group (RG) approach for critical phenomena, we address this question by
developing a State-Space Renormalization Group (SSRG) theory for NRNs, which
leads to an iterative RG equation for the flux correlation function. In square
and hypercubic lattices, we solve the RG equation exactly and find two types of
fixed point solutions: a family of nontrivial fixed points where the
correlation exhibits power-law decay and a trivial fixed point where the
correlation vanishes beyond the nearest neighbors. The power-law fixed point is
stable if and only if the power exponent is less than the lattice dimension
$n$. Consequently, the correlation function converges to the power-law fixed
point only when the correlation in the fine-grained network decays slower than
$r^{-n}$ and to the trivial fixed point otherwise. If the flux correlation in
the fine-grained network contains multiple stable solutions with different
exponents, the RG iteration dynamics select the fixed point solution with the
smallest exponent. We also discuss a possible connection between the RG flows
of flux correlation with those of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

superior to the existing MSE function in terms of strongness of loss

a new estimator that ensures global, exponential, parameter convergence under
the very weak assumption of interval excitation of the power-balance equation
regressor. To design the indirect adaptive controller we make the standard

directionality, high path loss, and shadowing. One can use beam alignment (BA)
techniques to find and adjust the direction of these narrow beams. In this
paper, BA at the base station (BS) is considered, where the BS sends a set of
BA packets to scan different angular regions while the user listens to the
channel and sends feedback to the BS for each received packet. It is assumed
that the packets and feedback received at the user and BS, respectively, can be
correctly decoded. Motivated by practical constraints such as propagation
delay, a feedback delay for each BA packet is considered. At the end of the BA,
the BS allocates a narrow beam to the user including its angle of departure for
data transmission and the objective is to maximize the resulting expected
beamforming gain. A general framework for studying this problem is proposed
based on which a lower bound on the optimal performance as well as an
optimality achieving scheme are obtained. Simulation results reveal significant
performance improvements over the state-of-the-art BA methods in the presence

block policy mirror descent (BPMD) method for solving a class of regularized
reinforcement learning (RL) problems with (strongly)-convex regularizers.
Compared to the traditional PG methods with a batch update rule, which visits
and updates the policy for every state, BPMD method has cheap per-iteration
computation via a partial update rule that performs the policy update on a
sampled state. Despite the nonconvex nature of the problem and a partial update
rule, we provide a unified analysis for several sampling schemes, and show that
BPMD achieves fast linear convergence to the global optimality. In particular,
uniform sampling leads to comparable worst-case total computational complexity
as batch PG methods. A necessary and sufficient condition for convergence with
on-policy sampling is also identified. With a hybrid sampling scheme, we
further show that BPMD enjoys potential instance-dependent acceleration,
leading to improved dependence on the state space and consequently
outperforming batch PG methods. We then extend BPMD methods to the stochastic
setting, by utilizing stochastic first-order information constructed from
samples. With a generative model, $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\left\lvert

Experiments on synthetic data sets demonstrate that FAIRIF yields models with
better fairness-utility trade-offs against various types of bias; and on

Hundreds of public RGB-D datasets containing various scenes, such as indoor,
outdoor, aerial, driving, and medical, have been proposed. These datasets are
useful for different applications and are fundamental for addressing classic
computer vision tasks, such as monocular depth estimation. This paper reviewed
and categorized image datasets that include depth information. We gathered 203
datasets that contain accessible data and grouped them into three categories:
scene/objects, body, and medical. We also provided an overview of the different
types of sensors, depth applications, and we examined trends and future
directions of the usage and creation of datasets containing depth data, and how
they can be applied to investigate the development of generalizable machine
learning models in the monocular depth estimation field.

  Selection","there is something wrong in the experiment",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Client selection strategies are widely adopted to handle the
communication-efficient problem in recent studies of Federated Learning (FL).
However, due to the large variance of the selected subset's update, prior
selection approaches with a limited sampling ratio cannot perform well on
convergence and accuracy in heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, in this
paper, we propose a novel stratified client selection scheme to reduce the
variance for the pursuit of better convergence and higher accuracy.
Specifically, to mitigate the impact of heterogeneity, we develop
stratification based on clients' local data distribution to derive approximate
homogeneous strata for better selection in each stratum. Concentrating on a
limited sampling ratio scenario, we next present an optimized sample size
allocation scheme by considering the diversity of stratum's variability, with
the promise of further variance reduction. Theoretically, we elaborate the
explicit relation among different selection schemes with regard to variance,
under heterogeneous settings, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our selection
scheme. Experimental results confirm that our approach not only allows for
better performance relative to state-of-the-art methods but also is compatible
with prevalent FL algorithms.

Specifically, we focus on publicly verifiable randomness (PVR), in which the
same sequence of trusted and verifiable random numbers is obtained by multiple
parties. PVR is a critical building block for many processes and algorithms
(including cryptography, scientific trials, electoral audits and international
treaties). However, current approaches (based on number theory) may soon become
vulnerable to quantum computers, motivating a growing demand for PVR based on
natural physical phenomena. In this context, we explore pulsars as a potential
physical PVR source. We first show that bit sequences extracted from the
measured flux densities of a bright millisecond pulsar can pass standardised
tests for randomness. We then quantify three illustrative methods of
bit-extraction from pulsar flux density sequences, using simultaneous
observations of a second pulsar carried out with the Parkes telescope in
Australia and the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST)
in China, supported by numerical simulations. We demonstrate that the same bit
sequence can indeed be obtained at both observatories, but the ubiquitous
presence of radiometer noise needs to be accounted for when determining the
expected bit error rate between two independent sequences. We discuss our
results in the context of an imaginary use-case in which two mutually
distrusting parties wish to obtain the same random bit sequence, exploring
potential methods to mitigate against a malicious participant.

using a variety of different channels. Movement is one of these channels and,
particularly in manipulation tasks, intent communication via movement is called
legibility. It alters a robot's trajectory to make it intent expressive. Here
we propose a novel evaluation method that improves the data efficiency of
collected experimental data when benchmarking approaches generating such
legible behavior. The primary novelty of the proposed method is that it uses
trajectories that were generated independently of the framework being tested.
This makes evaluation easier, enables N-way comparisons between approaches, and
allows easier comparison across papers. We demonstrate the efficiency of the
new evaluation method by comparing 10 legibility frameworks in 2 scenarios. The
paper, thus, provides readers with (1) a novel approach to investigate and/or

an ISAC frame structure for time-varying ISAC systems considering different
timescales. The pilot waveforms are judiciously designed by taking into account
both CS theories and hardware constraints induced by hybrid beamforming (HBF)

the density functional theory (DFT). However, there is currently a lack of a
general MPNN framework for directly predicting the tensor properties of the
crystals. In this work, a general framework for the prediction of tensor
properties was proposed: the tensor property of a crystal can be decomposed
into the average of the tensor contributions of all the atoms in the crystal,
and the tensor contribution of each atom can be expanded as the sum of the
tensor projections in the directions of the edges connecting the atoms. On this
basis, the edge-based expansions of force vectors, Born effective charges
(BECs), dielectric (DL) and piezoelectric (PZ) tensors were proposed. These
expansions are rotationally equivariant, while the coefficients in these tensor
expansions are rotationally invariant scalars which are similar to physical
quantities such as formation energy and band gap. The advantage of this tensor
prediction framework is that it does not require the network itself to be
equivariant. Therefore, in this work, we directly designed the edge-based
tensor prediction graph neural network (ETGNN) model on the basis of the
invariant graph neural network to predict tensors. The validity and high
precision of this tensor prediction framework were shown by the tests of ETGNN
on the extended systems, random perturbed structures and JARVIS-DFT datasets.

similar items to a given query image, is a very important task in remote
sensing applications. Deep hashing learning as the current mainstream method
has achieved satisfactory retrieval performance. On one hand, various deep
neural networks are used to extract semantic features of remote sensing images.
On the other hand, the hashing techniques are subsequently adopted to map the
high-dimensional deep features to the low-dimensional binary codes. This kind
of methods attempts to learn one hash function for both the query and database
samples in a symmetric way. However, with the number of database samples
increasing, it is typically time-consuming to generate the hash codes of
large-scale database images. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing
method, named asymmetric hash code learning (AHCL), for RSIR. The proposed AHCL
generates the hash codes of query and database images in an asymmetric way. In
more detail, the hash codes of query images are obtained by binarizing the
output of the network, while the hash codes of database images are directly
learned by solving the designed objective function. In addition, we combine the
semantic information of each image and the similarity information of pairs of
images as supervised information to train a deep hashing network, which
improves the representation ability of deep features and hash codes. The
experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms symmetric methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. The source code is available at

task-oriented dialog systems to understand users' goals and needs. Collecting
dialogue state labels including slots and values can be costly, especially with
the wide application of dialogue systems in more and more new-rising domains.
In this paper, we focus on how to utilize the language understanding and
generation ability of pre-trained language models for DST. We design a dual
prompt learning framework for few-shot DST. Specifically, we consider the
learning of slot generation and value generation as dual tasks, and two prompts
are designed based on such a dual structure to incorporate task-related
knowledge of these two tasks respectively. In this way, the DST task can be
formulated as a language modeling task efficiently under few-shot settings.
Experimental results on two task-oriented dialogue datasets show that the
proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot
methods, but also can generate unseen slots. It indicates that DST-related
knowledge can be probed from PLM and utilized to address low-resource DST
efficiently with the help of prompt learning.

minimum size of a set of vertices intersecting all sets of ${\cal B}.$ The
strict bramble number of $G,$ denoted by ${\sf sbn}(G),$ is the maximum order

way to extend the notion of acyclicity, departing from the fact that
(non-empty) acyclic graphs are exactly the graphs where every strict bramble
has order one. We initiate the study of this graph parameter by providing three
alternative definitions, each revealing different structural characteristics.
The first is a min-max theorem asserting that ${\sf sbn}(G)$ is equal to the
minimum $k$ for which $G$ is a minor of the lexicographic product of a tree and
a clique on $k$ vertices (also known as the lexicographic tree product number).
The second characterization is in terms of a new variant of a tree
decomposition called lenient tree decomposition. We prove that ${\sf sbn}(G)$
is equal to the minimum $k$ for which there exists a lenient tree decomposition
of $G$ of width at most $k.$ The third characterization is in terms of extremal

we prove that every edge-maximal graph of strict bramble number at most $k$ is
a $k$-domino-tree. We also identify three graphs that constitute the
minor-obstruction set of the class of graphs with strict bramble number at most
two. We complete our results by proving that, given some $G$ and $k,$ deciding

is applied to the entire problem. In the other, the method of lines is used
with DG-SEM in space and the fully implicit Runge-Kutta method Lobatto IIIC in
time. The two approaches are mathematically equivalent in the sense that they
lead to the same discrete solution. However, in practice they differ in several
important respects, including the terminology used to describe them, the
structure of the resulting software, and the interaction with nonlinear

which path to follow. Additionally, implementations of the two methods are

loading regime are critical to tuning the catalytic performance. However, the
understanding on such interactions and their distance dependent effects remains
elusive, especially for the heteronuclear SACs. In this study, we reveal the
effects of the distance-dependent inter-site interaction on the catalytic
performance of SACs. Using the density functional theory calculations, we
systematically investigate the heteronuclear iron and cobalt single atoms
co-supported on the nitrogen-doped graphene (FeN4-C and CoN4-C) for oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR). We find that as the distance between Fe and Co SACs
decreases, FeN4-C exhibits a reduced catalytic activity, which can be mitigated
by the presence of an axial hydroxyl ligand, whereas the activity of CoN4-C
shows a volcano-like evolution with the optimum reached at the intermediate
distance. We further unravel that the transition towards the high-spin state
upon adsorption of ORR intermediate adsorbates is responsible for the decreased
activity of both FeN4-C and CoN4-C at short inter-site distance. Such high-spin
state transition is also found to significantly shift the linear relation
between hydroxyl (*OH) and hydroperoxyl (*OOH) adsorbates. These findings not
only shed light on the SAC-specific effect of the distance-dependent inter-site
interaction between heteronuclear SACs, but also pave a way towards shifting
the long-standing linear relations observed in multiple-electron chemical
reactions.

Recent theoretical investigations suggest that transition metals display

most of these theories assume that the orbital moment originates from the

atomic center approximation}. In periodic crystals though, the contribution of
the interstitial regions is crucial and can lead to a severe misestimation of
the OHE. By applying the ""modern theory"" of orbital magnetization to the OHE,
we assess the relative importance of intra-atomic and inter-atomic

the OHE is mostly of intra-atomic origin for wide band-gap semiconductors

spite of its complexity, we show that the two-proton emission process obeys
similar rules as for binary emission processes like proton, alpha and heavy

by the centrifugal barrier, linearly depends upon the Coulomb parameter within
one order of magnitude. On the other hand, the universal linear dependence with
a negative slope between the logarithm of the reduced width and the
fragmentation potential, valid for any kind of binary decay process, is also
fulfilled for the two-proton emission with a relative good accuracy. As a
consequence of pairing correlations the two protons are simultaneously emitted
from a singlet paired state. We evidence that indeed one obtains a linear
dependence between the logarithm of the reduced width and pairing gap within a

camera-aware proxies explicitly capture local structures within clusters, by
which the intra-ID variance and inter-ID similarity can be better tackled.
Assisted with the camera-aware proxies, we design two proxy-level contrastive
learning losses that are, respectively, based on offline and online association
results. The offline association directly associates proxies according to the
clustering and splitting results, while the online strategy dynamically
associates proxies in terms of up-to-date features to reduce the noise caused
by the delayed update of pseudo labels. The combination of two losses enables
us to train a desirable Re-ID model. Extensive experiments on three person
Re-ID datasets and one vehicle Re-ID dataset show that our proposed approach
demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Code will

data is crucial in the current era of data abundance. In this paper, we propose
a graph/network version of the classical adaptive Sign algorithm for online
graph signal estimation under impulsive noise. Recently introduced graph
adaptive least mean squares algorithm is unstable under non-Gaussian impulsive
noise and has high computational complexity. The Graph-Sign algorithm proposed
in this work is based on the minimum dispersion criterion and therefore
impulsive noise does not hinder its estimation quality. Unlike the recently
proposed graph adaptive least mean p-th power algorithm, our Graph-Sign
algorithm can operate without prior knowledge of the noise distribution. The
proposed Graph-Sign algorithm has a faster run time because of its low
computational complexity compared to the existing adaptive graph signal
processing algorithms. Experimenting on steady-state and time-varying graph
signals estimation utilizing spectral properties of bandlimitedness and
sampling, the Graph-Sign algorithm demonstrates fast, stable, and robust graph
signal estimation performance under impulsive noise modeled by alpha stable,
Cauchy, Student's t, or Laplace distributions.

usually plagued with theoretical conundrums related not only with the
renormalization procedure itself, but also with the fact that the final result
leads usually to very large (finite) contributions incompatible with the
measured value of $\Lambda$ in cosmology. Herein, we compute the zero-point
energy (ZPE) for a nonminimally coupled (massive) scalar field in FLRW
spacetime using the off-shell adiabatic renormalization technique employed in
previous work. The general off-shell result yields a smooth function $\rho_{\rm
vac}(H)$ made out of powers of the Hubble rate and/or of its time derivatives
involving different (even) adiabatic orders $\sim H^N$ ($N=0,2,4,6,...)$, i.e.
it leads, remarkably enough, to the running vacuum model (RVM) structure. We
have verified the same result from the effective action formalism and used it
to find the $\beta$-function of the running quantum vacuum. No undesired
contributions $\sim m^4$ from particle masses appear and hence no fine-tuning
of the parameters is needed in $\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$. Furthermore, we find that
the higher power $\sim H^6$ could naturally drive RVM-inflation in the early
universe. Our calculation also elucidates in detail the equation of state of
the quantum vacuum: it proves to be not exactly $-1$ and is moderately
dynamical. The form of $\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ at low energies is also
characteristic of the RVM and consists of an additive term (the so-called
`cosmological constant') together with a small dynamical component $\sim \nu
H^2$ ($|\nu|\ll1$). Finally, we predict a slow ($\sim\ln H$) running of
Newton's gravitational coupling $G(H)$. The physical outcome of our
semiclassical QFT calculation is revealing: today's cosmic vacuum and the
gravitational strength should be both mildly dynamical.

each learning task performance is a challenge problem. Based on this, we
proposed a novel semi-supervised algorithm, termed as Multi-Task Multi-View

multi-views are the different aspects of an object and every view includes the
underlying common or special information of this object. As a consequence, we
will mine multiple views jointly latent factor of each learning task which
consists of each view special feature and the common feature of all views. By
this way, the original multi-task multi-view data has degenerated into
multi-task data, and exploring the correlations among multiple tasks enables to
make an improvement on the performance of learning algorithm. Another obvious
advantage of this approach is that we get latent representation of the set of
unlabeled instances by the constraint of regression task with labeled
instances. The performance of classification and semi-supervised clustering
task in these latent representations perform obviously better than it in raw
data. Furthermore, an anti-noise multi-task multi-view algorithm called

increases gradually with additional packets; however, each retransmission
maximally increases the Age of Information and causes severe degradation in
estimation mean squared error (MSE) performance. We optimize standard HARQ
schemes by allowing partial retransmissions to increase the packet reliability
gradually and limit the AoI growth. In incremental redundancy HARQ, we optimize
the retransmission time to enable the early arrival of the next status updates.
In Chase combining HARQ, since packet length remains fixed, we allow
retransmission and new updates in a single time slot using non-orthogonal
signaling. Non-orthogonal retransmissions increase packet reliability without
delaying the fresh updates. We formulate bi-objective optimization with the
proposed variance of the MSE-based cost function and standard long-term average
MSE cost function to guarantee short-term performance stability. Using the
Markov decision process formulation, we find the optimal static and dynamic
policies under the proposed HARQ schemes to improve MSE performance further.
The simulation results show that the proposed HARQ-based policies are more

enhanced our knowledge of nearby supernova (SN) remnants with ages younger than
500 years by establishing Cassiopeia A and the remnant of Tycho's SN as
very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources. The remnant of Kepler's SN, which is
the product of the most recent naked-eye supernova in our Galaxy, is comparable
in age to the other two, but is significantly more distant. If the gamma-ray
luminosities of the remnants of Tycho's and Kepler's SNe are similar, then the
latter is expected to be one of the faintest gamma-ray sources within reach of
the current generation IACT arrays.
  Here we report evidence at a statistical level of 4.6 sigma for a VHE signal
from the remnant of Kepler's SN based on deep observations by the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) with an exposure of 152 hours. The measured
integral flux above an energy of 226 GeV is ~0.3% of the flux of the Crab
Nebula. The spectral energy distribution (SED) reveals a gamma-ray emitting
component connecting the VHE emission observed with H.E.S.S. to the emission
observed at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT. The overall SED is similar to that of
the remnant of Tycho's SN, possibly indicating the same non-thermal emission
processes acting in both these young remnants of thermonuclear SNe.

Analysis
of these structures is usually based on simple morphological descriptors which

present a machine learning approach to introduce a complete yet compact

appropriate lower-dimensional (latent) space. We apply a combination of
Variational Autoencoder and Principal Component Analysis to obtain a set of 285

into the latent ones. Thus, latent features can be considered as an extended
description of sunspot groups and, in our opinion, can expand the possibilities
for the research on sunspot groups. In particular, we demonstrate an
application for estimation of the sunspot group complexity. The proposed
parametrization model is generic and can be applied to investigation of other
traces of solar activity observed in various spectrum lines. Key components of
this work, which are the parametrization model, dataset of sunspot groups and

at a recent redshift $z_t$, reducing the effective gravitational constant
$G_{\rm eff}$ by about $10\%$ for $z>z_t$, has the potential to lead to a
resolution of the Hubble tension if $z_t\lesssim 0.01$. Since $H(z)^2\sim
G_{\rm eff}$, such a transition would also lead to sharp change of the slope of
the Hubble diagram at $z=z_t$ and a sharp decrease in the number of galaxies
per redshift bin at $z_t$. Here we attempt to impose constraints on such a
transition by using two robust low-z redshift survey datasets ($z<0.01$), taken
from the Six-degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS) as well as the 2MASS Redshift
Survey (2MRS). In both surveys, we bin the data in redshift bins and focus on
the number of galaxies in each bin ($\Delta N(z_i)$). We observe a peak in the
distribution of galaxies near a distance of approximately 20 Mpc in both
datasets. This feature could be attributed to galactic density fluctuations, to
coherent peculiar velocities of galaxies or to an ultra late-time gravitational
transition in the same era. In the context of the later scenario we show that
this feature could have been induced by a sharp change of $G_{\rm eff}$ by
$\Delta G_{\rm eff}/G_{\rm eff} \simeq 0.6$ at $z_t\simeq 0.005$. Thus, in a
conservative approach, this method can be used to impose constraints on a
possible abrupt change of the gravitational constant taking place at very low
redshifts.

establish variational principles for it in terms of upper and lower rate
distortion dimensions and show there exists a Bowen's equation between induced
upper metric mean dimension with potential and upper metric mean dimension with
potential.
  Secondly, we continue to introduce two new notions, called BS metric mean

establish Bowen's equations for Bowen upper metric mean dimension and Packing
upper metric mean dimension with potential on subsets. Besides, we also obtain
two variational principles for BS metric mean dimension and Packing BS metric

  Finally, the special interest about the Bowen upper metric mean dimension of
the set of generic points of ergodic measures are also involved.

development of smart parking systems that can communicate the availability of
parking slots to the end users. Towards this, various deep learning based
solutions using convolutional neural networks have been proposed for parking
space occupation detection. Though these approaches are robust to partial

investigates the use of dehazing networks that improves the performance of
parking space occupancy classifier under hazy conditions. Additionally,
training procedures are proposed for dehazing networks to maximize the
performance of the system on both hazy and non-hazy conditions. The proposed
system is deployable as part of existing smart parking systems where limited
number of cameras are used to monitor hundreds of parking spaces. To validate
our approach, we have developed a custom hazy parking system dataset from
real-world task-driven test set of RESIDE-\b{eta} dataset. The proposed
approach is tested against existing state-of-the-art parking space detectors on

sparked a huge interest as a functional building block for memory storage and
spintronic applications. In this respect, defect engineering has been in the
focus of a long-standing quest for fabricating LSMO thin films with highest
quality in terms of both structural and magnetic properties. Here, we discuss
the correlation between structural defects, such as oxygen vacancies and
impurity islands, and magnetism in La0.74Sr0.26MnO3/SrTiO3 (LSMO/STO) epitaxial
heterostructures by systematic control of the growth temperature and
post-deposition annealing conditions. Upon increasing the growth temperature
within the 500 $-$ 700 $^{\circ}$C range, the epitaxial LSMO films experience a
progressive improvement in oxygen stoichiometry, leading to enhanced magnetic
characteristics. Concurrently, however, the use of a high growth temperature
triggers the diffusion of impurities from the bulk of STO, which cause the
creation of off-stoichiometric, dendritic-like SrMoOx islands at the
film/substrate interface. As a valuable workaround, post-deposition annealing
of the LSMO films grown at a relatively-low temperature of about 500
$^{\circ}$C permits to obtain high-quality epitaxy, atomically-flat surface as
well as a sharp magnetic transition above room temperature and robust
ferromagnetism. Furthermore, under such optimized fabrication conditions
possible scenarios for the formation of the magnetic dead layer as a function
of LSMO film thickness are discussed. Our findings offer effective routes to
finely tailor the complex interplay between structural and magnetic properties

increasing population, is an ubiquitous and well-researched phenomenon. This
article is focused on socio-economic performance scaling, which could possibly
be driven by increasing returns of the spatial size and density of interaction
networks. If this is indeed the case, we should also find that spatial barriers
to interaction affect scaling and cause local performance deviations. Possible
barring effects of municipal boundaries are particularly interesting from the
perspective of urban area governance policy and regional cooperation. To our
best knowledge, this is the first study on this politically relevant and
strongly disputed subject. We test the hypothesis of possible barring effects
of municipal boundaries by correlating municipal boundaries with the structure
of commuter networks within a large densely urbanized region, the Randstad in
The Netherlands. The measured network impacts of these boundaries are
subsequently correlated with local employment deviations. In order to spatially
pinpoint correlations, we apply advanced spatially weighted modelling
technique. We find that municipal borders have significant effects on
inter-municipal commuting. Moreover we can indicate the specific effect of
individual municipal borders precisely on the map. The results show
particularly significant correlations along dividing lines between large urban
agglomerations and rural communities. The southern part of the Randstad is more
fragmented by such dividing lines than the northern part, which could partly
explain the diverging economic development between the two parts.

overall population pedestrian mortality rate. However, there is no data to
clarify the pedestrians' categories in both fatal and nonfatal accidents, since
police reports often do not keep a record of whether a victim was using a
wheelchair or has a disability. Currently, real-time detection of vulnerable
road users using advanced traffic sensors installed at the infrastructure side
has a great potential to significantly improve traffic safety at the
intersection. In this research, we develop a systematic framework with a
combination of machine learning and deep learning models to distinguish
disabled people from normal walk pedestrians and predict the time needed to
reach the next side of the intersection. The proposed framework shows high
performance both at vulnerable user classification and arrival time prediction
accuracy.

facing increasingly difficult decisions regarding what capabilities to select

helped either. It has resulted in the rebranding and reuse of emerging
technological capabilities like prediction, simulation, AI, and Machine

capabilities in a DT can result in missed opportunities, strategic
misalignments, inflated expectations, and risk of it being rejected as just
hype by the practitioners. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes the
digitalization framework, designed and developed by following a Design Science

practitioners select an appropriate level of sophistication in a DT by weighing
the pros and cons for each level, deciding evaluation criteria for the digital

organizational processes and strategies, and value creation. Three real-life

However, their small form-factor and limited computation resources make it

known to be more compute-intensive than their 2D counterparts. In this paper,
we propose DeepMix, a mobility-aware, lightweight, and hybrid 3D object
detection framework for improving the user experience of AR/MR on mobile
headsets. Motivated by our analysis and evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D
object detection models, DeepMix intelligently combines edge-assisted 2D object
detection and novel, on-device 3D bounding box estimations that leverage depth
data captured by headsets. This leads to low end-to-end latency and
significantly boosts detection accuracy in mobile scenarios. A unique feature
of DeepMix is that it fully exploits the mobility of headsets to fine-tune
detection results and boost detection accuracy. To the best of our knowledge,
DeepMix is the first 3D object detection that achieves 30 FPS (an end-to-end
latency much lower than the 100 ms stringent requirement of interactive AR/MR).
We implement a prototype of DeepMix on Microsoft HoloLens and evaluate its
performance via both extensive controlled experiments and a user study with 30+

also reduces end-to-end latency by 2.68--9.15x, compared to the baseline that

artificial intelligence and brain modeling: how can neural networks learn
intrinsic reference frames for objects and parse visual scenes into part-whole
hierarchies by dynamically allocating nodes in a parse tree? APCNs address this
problem by using a novel combination of ideas: (1) hypernetworks are used for
dynamically generating recurrent neural networks that predict parts and their
locations within intrinsic reference frames conditioned on higher object-level
embedding vectors, and (2) reinforcement learning is used in conjunction with
backpropagation for end-to-end learning of model parameters. The APCN
architecture lends itself naturally to multi-level hierarchical learning and is
closely related to predictive coding models of cortical function. Using the
MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Omniglot datasets, we demonstrate that APCNs can (a)
learn to parse images into part-whole hierarchies, (b) learn compositional
representations, and (c) transfer their knowledge to unseen classes of objects.
With their ability to dynamically generate parse trees with part locations for
objects, APCNs offer a new framework for explainable AI that leverages advances
in deep learning while retaining interpretability and compositionality.

the electronic doping density in metal-halide perovskites, not to mention of a
control thereof. This paper presents a multifaceted approach to determine the
electronic doping density for a range of different lead-halide perovskite
systems. Optical and electrical characterisation techniques comprising
intensity-dependent and transient photoluminescence, AC Hall effect,
transfer-length-methods, and charge extraction measurements were instrumental
in quantifying an upper limit for the doping density. The obtained values are
subsequently compared to the charge on the electrodes per unit volume at
short-circuit conditions, which amounts to roughly $10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. This
figure equals the product of the capacitance $C$ and the built-in potential
$V_\mathrm{bi}$ and represents the critical limit below which doping-induced
charges do not influence the device performance. The experimental results
demonstrate consistently that the doping density is below this critical
threshold ($<10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ which means $<CV_\mathrm{bi}$ per unit volume)
for all common lead-based metal-halide perovskites. Nevertheless, although the
density of doping-induced charges is too low to redistribute the built-in
voltage in the perovskite active layer, mobile ions are present in sufficient
quantities to create space-charge-regions in the active layer, reminiscent of
doped pn-junctions. These results are well supported by drift-diffusion
simulations which confirm that the device performance is not affected by such
low doping densities.

propose to develop a web-based food review system at Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) named NTU Food Hunter, which incorporates different deep
learning approaches that help users with food selection. First, we implement
the BERT and LSTM deep learning models into the system for sentiment analysis
of food reviews. Then, we develop a Part-of-Speech (POS) algorithm to
automatically identify and extract adjective-noun pairs from the review content
for review tag generation based on POS tagging and dependency parsing. Finally,
we also train a RankNet model for the re-ranking of the retrieval results to
improve the accuracy in our Solr-based food reviews search system. The
experimental results show that our proposed deep learning approaches are
promising for the applications of real-world problems.

multiobjective learner performance-based behavior algorithm is proposed. The
proposed algorithm is based on the process of transferring students from high
school to college. The proposed technique produces a set of non-dominated
solutions. To judge the ability and efficacy of the proposed multiobjective
algorithm, it is evaluated against a group of benchmarks and five real-world
engineering optimization problems. Additionally, to evaluate the proposed
technique quantitatively, several most widely used metrics are applied.
Moreover, the results are confirmed statistically. The proposed work is then
compared with three multiobjective algorithms, which are MOWCA, NSGA-II, and
MODA. Similar to the proposed technique, the other algorithms in the literature
were run against the benchmarks, and the real-world engineering problems
utilized in the paper. The algorithms are compared with each other employing
descriptive, tabular, and graphical demonstrations. The results proved the
ability of the proposed work in providing a set of non-dominated solutions, and
that the algorithm outperformed the other participated algorithms in most of
the cases.

  (II)","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Numerical simulations demonstrate a link between dynamically cold initial
solutions and self-similarity. However the nature of this link is not fully
understood. Cold initial conditions alone without further symmetry do not lead
to self-similarity. Here we show that when the system approaches equilibrium a
new symmetry appears. The combination of this equilibrium symmetry with the
cold symmetry in the initial conditions leads to full self-similarity. As a
consequence for any initially cold system even if the initial spatial
distribution is not self-similar we will observe an evolution towards
self-similarity near equilibrium. The case of one dimensional systems or
spherically symmetric systems in 3D are discussed in detail. Systems depending
on the energy and other integrals are also considered. The problem of the
degeneracy of the self-similar solutions at equilibrium is tackled. It is shown
that very small perturbations at the center of the system have the ability to
break this degeneracy and lead to the convergence towards a specific
auto-similar solution.

pivotal for numerical analysis of photonic structures. In comparison to other
methods, they offer much faster computation, especially for structures with
constant cross-sectional shapes (such as metasurface units). However, when the
cross-sectional shape varies even mildly (such as a taper), existing
semi-analytical methods suffer from high computational cost. We show that the
existing methods can be viewed as a zeroth-order approximation with respect to
the structure's cross-sectional variation. We instead derive a high-order
perturbative expansion with respect to the cross-sectional variation. Based on
this expansion, we propose a new semi-analytical method that is fast to compute
even in presence of large cross-sectional shape variation. Furthermore, we
design an algorithm that automatically discretizes the structure in a way that
achieves a user specified accuracy level while at the same time reducing the
computational cost.

  Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Their Communities",,,,,"cs.CY cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are blockchain-based cryptographic tokens to
represent ownership of unique content such as images, videos, or 3D objects.
Despite NFTs' increasing popularity and skyrocketing trading prices, little is
known about people's perceptions of and experiences with NFTs. In this work, we
focus on NFT creators and present results of an exploratory qualitative study
in which we interviewed 15 NFT creators from nine different countries. Our
participants had nuanced feelings about NFTs and their communities. We found
that most of our participants were enthusiastic about the underlying
technologies and how they empower individuals to express their creativity and
pursue new business models of content creation. Our participants also gave
kudos to the NFT communities that have supported them to learn, collaborate,
and grow in their NFT endeavors. However, these positivities were juxtaposed by
their accounts of the many challenges that they encountered and thorny issues
that the NFT ecosystem is grappling with around ownership of digital content,
low-quality NFTs, scams, possible money laundering, and regulations. We discuss
how the built-in properties (e.g., decentralization) of blockchains and NFTs
might have contributed to some of these issues. We present design implications
on how to improve the NFT ecosystem (e.g., making NFTs even more accessible to
newcomers and the broader population).
