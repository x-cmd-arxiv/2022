light-flavor violations, which are found to be moderate and of the order of
20%. The successful reproduction of the BESIII spectra, in both the
hidden-charm and hidden-charm strange sectors, strongly supports that the
$Z_{cs}(3985)$ and $Z_c(3900)$ are SU(3) flavor partners placed in the same
octet multiplet. The best results are obtained when an energy-dependent term in
the diagonal $D^{(*)}\bar D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ interaction is included, leading to
resonances (poles above the thresholds) to describe these exotic states. We
have also made predictions for the isovector $Z_{c}^*$ and isodoublet
$Z_{cs}^*$, $D^*\bar{D}^*$ and $D^*\bar{D}_{s}^*$ molecules, with
$J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ and $J^{P}=1^{+}$, respectively. These states would be
heavy-quark spin symmetry partners of the $Z_{c}$ and $Z_{cs}$. Besides the

decisive role in modulating a wide range of physical properties in
medium-entropy alloy (MEA) and high-entropy alloy (HEA). The enormous
configurational space of these alloys implies multiple forms of SRO are likely
to develop concurrently but such structural diversity has not been reported.
Here we show, through extensive {\em ab initio}-based sampling study, that
SiGeSn medium-entropy alloys spontaneously develop two distinct forms of SRO.
Remarkably, the two types of SROs, which carry different energies, distinct
degrees of local ordering, and dissimilar electronic structures, are found to
co-exist in a wide range of compositions of SiGeSn alloys. The co-existence of
two SROs is rationalized through their virtual degeneracy of thermodynamic
stability, due to the subtle balance in the change of enthalpy and
configurational entropy upon the transformation between the two SROs. Such
co-existence of SROs thus suggests an inherent structural heterogeneity, a
diffuse electronic structure, and a new route for band engineering in SiGeSn
MEA. More generally, our finding indicates the possible ubiquity of the
co-existence of multiple forms of SRO in a broad range of MEAs and HEAs, which
has profound implications on their diverse physical properties.

and perhaps unanticipated physical phenomena. An example is the fractional
quantum Hall effect, where interaction between electrons gives rise to
fractionally quantized Hall conductance. In photonic systems, the nonlinear
response of an ambient medium acts to mediate interaction between photons; in
the mean-field limit these dynamics are described by the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger (also called Gross-Pitaevskii) equation. Recently, it was shown
that at weak nonlinearity, soliton motion in nonlinear Thouless pumps (a
dimensionally reduced implementation of a Chern insulator) could be quantized
to the Chern number of the band from which the soliton bifurcates. Here, we
show theoretically and experimentally using arrays of coupled optical
waveguides that sufficiently strong nonlinearity acts to fractionally quantize
the motion of solitons. Specifically, we find that the soliton returns to
itself after multiple cycles of the Thouless pump - but displaced by an integer
number of unit cells - leading to a rich fractional plateaux structure
describing soliton motion. Our results demonstrate a perhaps surprising example
of the behavior of non-trivial topological systems in the presence of

tackling data availability attacks against light nodes, employing
two-dimensional Reed-Solomon codes to encode the list of transactions and a

theoretical analysis requiring computationally demanding formulas is provided.
This makes ASBK difficult to optimize in situations of practical interest. In
this paper, we introduce a much simpler model for such a protocol, which
additionally supports the use of codes with arbitrary rate. This makes
blockchains implementing ASBK much easier to design and optimize. Furthermore,
disposing of a clearer view of the protocol, some general features and
considerations can be derived (e.g., nodes behaviour in largely participated

from the use of codes defined over large finite fields, with code rates that

  Sequential Decision-Making",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Assessing the effects of a policy based on observational data from a
different policy is a common problem across several high-stake decision-making
domains, and several off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed.
However, these methods largely formulate OPE as a problem disassociated from
the process used to generate the data (i.e. structural assumptions in the form
of a causal graph). We argue that explicitly highlighting this association has
important implications on our understanding of the fundamental limits of OPE.
First, this implies that current formulation of OPE corresponds to a narrow set
of tasks, i.e. a specific causal estimand which is focused on prospective
evaluation of policies over populations or sub-populations. Second, we
demonstrate how this association motivates natural desiderata to consider a
general set of causal estimands, particularly extending the role of OPE for
counterfactual off-policy evaluation at the level of individuals of the
population. A precise description of the causal estimand highlights which OPE
estimands are identifiable from observational data under the stated generative
assumptions. For those OPE estimands that are not identifiable, the causal
perspective further highlights where more experimental data is necessary, and
highlights situations where human expertise can aid identification and
estimation. Furthermore, many formalisms of OPE overlook the role of
uncertainty entirely in the estimation process.We demonstrate how specifically
characterising the causal estimand highlights the different sources of
uncertainty and when human expertise can naturally manage this uncertainty. We
discuss each of these aspects as actionable desiderata for future OPE research
at scale and in-line with practical utility.

yields a practical classification algorithm for two dialects. We demonstrate
that this thresholding algorithm for two dialects can be bootstrapped from a

theoretical and the (non-parametric) empirical distributions of file behaviors
for one dialect yield good classification performance, and outperform
classification based on simply counting messages.
  Our theoretical framework relies on statistical independence of messages

therefore greatly reduce the number of files they need to consider when

specification of communication protocols that are unbounded in time. Usually
infinite session types are introduced as simple finite-state expressions

Alternatively, some systems of label- or value-dependent session types go
beyond simple recursive types. However, leaving dependent types aside, there is
a much richer world of infinite session types, ranging through various forms of
parametric equational definitions, all the way to arbitrary infinite types in a
coinductively defined space. We study infinite session types across a spectrum

on blood flow from the vascular geometry. However, it requires to extract
accurate models of arteries from low resolution medical images, which remains
challenging. Centerline-based representation is widely used to model large
vascular networks with small vessels, as it enables manual editing and encodes
the topological information. In this work, we propose an automatic method to
generate an hexahedral mesh suitable for CFD directly from centerlines. The
proposed method is an improvement of the state-of-the-art in terms of
robustness, mesh quality and reproductibility.
  Both the modeling and meshing tasks are addressed. A new vessel model based
on penalized splines is proposed to overcome the limitations inherent to the
centerline representation, such as noise and sparsity. Bifurcations are
reconstructed using a physiologically accurate parametric model that we
extended to planar n-furcations. Finally, a volume mesh with structured,
hexahedral and flow oriented cells is produced from the proposed vascular
network model.
  The proposed method offers a better robustness and mesh quality than the
state-of-the-art methods. As it combines both modeling and meshing techniques,
it can be applied to edit the geometry and topology of vascular models
effortlessly to study the impact on hemodynamics. We demonstrate the efficiency
of our method by entirely meshing a dataset of 60 cerebral vascular networks.
92\% of the vessels and 83\% of the bifurcations where mesh without defects
needing manual intervention, despite the challenging aspect of the input data.

stability of the Minkowski solution in the massless case with the use of
generalized wave coordinates. This requires the understanding of the Dirac
equation in curved spacetime, for which we establish various estimates. The
proof is based on the vector-field method which is widely used in works on the
stability of Minkowski problems for other Einstein-coupled systems. Under a
specific choice of the tetrad, we show that components of the Dirac field
satisfy a quasilinear wave equation, by resolving a potential loss of
derivative problem. We also show that the semilinear nonlinearity of this
equation behaves like a null form. In this way, we obtain the sharp decay of
the field along the light cone. The structure of the energy-momentum tensor
causes worse behavior of some components of the metric than the vaccum case,
but an additional structure shows that there is no harm to the global existence
result. In addition, we develop an estimate of the Dirac equation itself
adpated to the decay of the metric, as this provides better estimates in the
interior compared with the estimates from the second order equation. The
combination of these estimates leads to a good control of the Dirac field that
helps close the proof. We shall also see how our argument here gives a proof of
the wellposedness of the system in the massive case.

learning from discrete data this can be guaranteed by including some sort of

important structures from the physics. In this paper, we introduce Symplectic
Momentum Neural Networks (SyMo) as models from a discrete formulation of

geometric structures such as momentum and a symplectic form and learn from
limited data. Furthermore, it allows to learn dynamics only from the poses as
training data. We extend SyMos to include variational integrators within the
learning framework by developing an implicit root-find layer which leads to
End-to-End Symplectic Momentum Neural Networks (E2E-SyMo). Through experimental
results, using the pendulum and cartpole, we show that such combination not

models with the capability of preserving the symplectic form and show better

for the first time, by relating it to the theory of Lagrangian multiforms, a
framework designed to capture integrability in a variational fashion. This
provides a significant connection between Lagrangian multiforms and the CYBE,
one of the most fundamental concepts of integrable systems. This is achieved by
introducing a generating Lagrangian multiform which depends on a skew-symmetric
classical $r$-matrix with spectral parameters. The multiform Euler-Lagrange
equations produce a generating Lax equation which yields a generating zero
curvature equation. The CYBE plays a role at three levels: 1) It ensures the
commutativity of the flows of the generating Lax equation; 2) It ensures that
the generating zero curvature equation holds; 3) It implies the closure
relation for the generating Lagrangian multiform. The specification of an
integrable hierarchy is achieved by fixing certain data: a finite set $S\in
CP^1$, a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued rational function
with poles in $S$ and an $r$-matrix. We show how our framework is able to
generate a large class of ultralocal integrable hierarchies by providing
several known and new examples pertaining to the rational or trigonometric
class. These include the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur hierarchy, the sine-Gordon
(sG) hierarchy and various hierachies related to Zakharov-Mikhailov type models
which contain the Faddeev-Reshetikhin (FR) model and recently introduced
deformed sigma/Gross-Neveu models as particular cases. The versatility of our
method is illustrated by showing how to couple integrable hierarchies together
to create new examples of integrable field theories and their hierarchies. We
provide two examples: the coupling of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger system to the
FR model and the coupling of sG with the anisotropic FR model.

acceleration through the Minkowski vacuum and an inertial one immersed in a
thermal reservoir at the Unruh temperature, exploring the implications of the
well-known non-equivalence between the two cases on their dynamics. We find
that both the accelerated detector's dissipation rate and the shift of its
frequency caused by the coupling to the field bath depend on the acceleration
temperature. Interestingly enough this is not only in contrast to the case of
inertial motion in a heat bath but also to any analogous quantum Brownian
motion model in open systems, where dissipation and frequency shifts are not
known to exhibit temperature dependencies. Nonetheless, we show that the

quantitatively larger than the classical result by a factor $\pi/2$. Under
modern cryogenic conditions, thermal photons in the cavity are negligible, thus
the axion cavity can be considered as a quantum device emitting single-photons

axions transition in batches and the converted energy accumulates in the
electromagnetic field inside the cavity. It reveals a possibility for the axion
cavity experiment to handle the signal sensitivity at the quantum level, e.g.
cross-power and second order correlation measurements. The correlation of
photon field quadratures in the amplification chain, within current technology,
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio up to two orders of magnitude or one order
of magnitude compared with single-path amplification scheme based on high
electronic mobility transistor amplifier or Josephson Parametric Amplifiers

capturing research processes do not align well with the rich working practices
of scientists. We advocate here for simple mechanisms that can be integrated
easily with current work practices to capture basic information about every
data product consumed or produced in a project. We argue that by thus extending
the scope of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data in
both time and space to enable the creation of a continuous chain of continuous
and ubiquitous FAIRness linkages (CUF-Links) from inputs to outputs, such
mechanisms can provide a strong foundation for documenting the provenance
linkages that are essential to reproducible research. We give examples of
mechanisms that can achieve these goals, and review how they have been applied
in practice.

  pages, 57 figures",,,,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ""Space-time"" (ST) wave packets constitute a broad class of pulsed optical
fields that are rigidly transported in linear media without diffraction or
dispersion, and are therefore propagation-invariant in absence of optical
nonlinearities or waveguiding structures. Such wave packets exhibit unique
characteristics, such as controllable group velocities in free space and exotic
refractive phenomena. At the root of these behaviors is a fundamental feature
underpinning ST wave packets: their spectra are not separable with respect to
the spatial and temporal degrees of freedom. Indeed, the spatio-temporal
structure is endowed with non-differentiable angular dispersion, in which each
spatial frequency is associated with a single prescribed wavelength.
Furthermore, deviation from this particular spatio-temporal structure yields
novel behaviors that depart from propagation invariance in a precise manner,
such as acceleration with an arbitrary axial distribution of the group
velocity, tunable dispersion profiles, and Talbot effects in space-time.
Although the basic concept of ST wave packets has been known since the 1980's,
only very recently has rapid experimental development emerged. These advances
are made possible by innovations in spatio-temporal Fourier synthesis, thereby
opening a new frontier for structured light at the intersection of beam optics
and ultrafast optics.

  The asymptotic behavior of the underlying stochastic network is given when
the number $N$ of stations and the fleet size increase at the same rate. The
analysis involves a Markov process on a state space with dimension of order
$N^2$. It is quite remarkable that the state process describing the evolution
of the stations, whose dimension is of order $N$, converges in distribution,

in a diffuse plasma, where they gain a small effective mass. Studies of the

varying effective mass, supposed to mimic the photons' interaction with a
physically realistic plasma density profile. We carry out relativistic
simulations of a massive Proca field evolving on a Kerr background, with
modifications to account for the spatially varying effective mass. This allows
us to treat the spin-1 case directly relevant to photons, and to study the
effect of thinner disk profiles in the plasma. We find similar qualitative
results to the scalar case, and so support the conclusions of that work: either
a constant asymptotic mass or a shell-like plasma structure is required for
superradiant growth to occur. We study thin disks and find a leakage of the
superradiant cloud that suppresses its growth, concluding that thick disks are
more likely to support the instability.

performance of various approaches to impute data degrade rapidly in the extreme
scenarios of low data sampling and noisy sampling, a case present in many
real-world problems in the field of traffic sensing and environment monitoring,
etc. However, jointly exploiting the spatiotemporal and periodic structure,
which is generally not captured by classical matrix completion approaches, can
improve the imputation performance of sensor data in such real-world
conditions. We present a Bayesian approach towards spatiotemporal matrix
completion wherein we estimate the underlying temporarily varying subspace
using a Variational Bayesian technique. We jointly couple the low-rank matrix
completion with the state space autoregressive framework along with a penalty
function on the slowly varying subspace to model the temporal and periodic
evolution in the data. A major advantage of our method is that a critical
parameter like the rank of the model is automatically tuned using the automatic
relevance determination (ARD) approach, unlike most matrix/tensor completion
techniques. We also propose a robust version of the above formulation, which
improves the performance of imputation in the presence of outliers. We evaluate
the proposed Variational Bayesian Filtering with Subspace Information (VBFSI)
method to impute matrices in real-world traffic and air pollution data.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art methods and provides a sufficiently accurate imputation for
different sampling rates. In particular, we demonstrate that fusing the
subspace evolution over days can improve the imputation performance with even
15% of the data sampling.

neighborhood metric learning (ANML). In ANML, we design two thresholds to
adaptively identify the inseparable similar and dissimilar samples in the
training procedure, thus inseparable sample removing and metric parameter
learning are implemented in the same procedure. Due to the non-continuity of
the proposed ANML, we develop an ingenious function, named \emph{log-exp mean

efficiently solved by the gradient descent method. Similar to Triplet loss,
ANML can be used to learn both the linear and deep embeddings. By analyzing the
proposed method, we find it has some interesting properties. For example, when
ANML is used to learn the linear embedding, current famous metric learning
algorithms such as the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) and neighbourhood
components analysis (NCA) are the special cases of the proposed ANML by setting
the parameters different values. When it is used to learn deep features, the
state-of-the-art deep metric learning algorithms such as Triplet loss, Lifted

Furthermore, the \emph{log-exp mean function} proposed in our method gives a

instruction of large student bodies. Especially with the increasing
digitization of education and interest in large-scale standardized testing, the
popularity of automatic grading has risen to the point where commercial
solutions are widely available and used. However, for short answer formats,
automatic grading is challenging due to natural language ambiguity and
versatility. While automatic short answer grading models are beginning to
compare to human performance on some datasets, their robustness, especially to
adversarially manipulated data, is questionable. Exploitable vulnerabilities in
grading models can have far-reaching consequences ranging from cheating
students receiving undeserved credit to undermining automatic grading
altogether - even when most predictions are valid. In this paper, we devise a
black-box adversarial attack tailored to the educational short answer grading
scenario to investigate the grading models' robustness. In our attack, we
insert adjectives and adverbs into natural places of incorrect student answers,
fooling the model into predicting them as correct. We observed a loss of
prediction accuracy between 10 and 22 percentage points using the

strikingly similar to those developed independently for localizing touch on
humanoid robots, such as the iCub, equipped with artificial electronic skin on
the majority of its body surface (Roncone et al., 2014; Hoffmann, 2021). In
this chapter, we will review the key features of these models, discuss their
similarities and differences to each other, and to other models in the
literature. Using robots as embodied computational models is an example of
synthetic methodology or 'understanding by building' (e.g., Hoffmann and
Pfeifer, 2018), computational embodied neuroscience (Caligiore et al., 2010) or
'synthetic psychology of the self' (Prescott and Camilleri, 2019). Such models
have the advantage that they need to be worked out into every detail, making
any theory explicit and complete. There is also an additional way of
(pre)validating such a theory other than comparing to the biological or
psychological phenomenon studied by simply verifying that a particular
implementation really performs the task: can the robot localize where it is
being touched (see https://youtu.be/pfse424t5mQ)?

small, highly nonlinear scales. Extracting information from these scales
requires higher-order statistics and the controlling of related systematics
such as baryonic effects. To account for baryonic effects in cosmological
analyses at reduced computational cost, semi-analytic baryonic correction
models (BCMs) have been proposed. Here, we study the accuracy of BCMs for WL
peak counts, a well studied, simple, and effective higher-order statistic. We
compare WL peak counts generated from the full hydrodynamical simulation
IllustrisTNG and a baryon-corrected version of the corresponding dark
matter-only simulation IllustrisTNG-Dark. We apply galaxy shape noise expected
at the depths reached by DES, KiDS, HSC, LSST, $\textit{Roman}$, and
$\textit{Euclid}$. We find that peak counts in BCMs are (i) accurate at the
percent level for peaks with $\mathrm{S/N}<4$, (ii) statistically
indistinguishable from IllustrisTNG in most current and ongoing surveys, but
(iii) insufficient for deep future surveys covering the largest solid angles,
such as LSST and $\textit{Euclid}$. We find that BCMs match individual peaks
accurately, but underpredict the amplitude of the highest peaks. We conclude
that existing BCMs are a viable substitute for full hydrodynamical simulations
in cosmological parameter estimation from beyond-Gaussian statistics for
ongoing and future surveys with modest solid angles. For the largest surveys,
BCMs need to be refined to provide a more accurate match, especially to the
highest peaks.

iterative bounded-distance decoding (iBDD) can be improved with the aid of a
moderate amount of soft information, maintaining a low decoding complexity. One
promising approach is error-and-erasure (EaE) decoding, whose performance can
be reliably estimated with density evolution (DE). However, the extrinsic
message passing (EMP) decoder required by the DE analysis entails a much higher
complexity than the simple intrinsic message passing (IMP) decoder. In this
paper, we simplify the EMP decoding algorithm for the EaE channel for two
commonly-used EaE decoders by deriving the EMP decoding results from the IMP
decoder output and some additional logical operations based on the algebraic
structure of the component codes and the EaE decoding rule. Simulation results
show that the number of BDD steps is reduced to being comparable with IMP.
Furthermore, we propose a heuristic modification of the EMP decoder that
reduces the complexity further. In numerical simulations, the decoding
performance of the modified decoder yields up to 0.2 dB improvement compared to
standard EMP decoding.

directly incorporating this into a penalty that is effectively computed via a
heat flow-based local network dynamics. In fact, we demonstrate a procedure to
construct such a network based on the available data. Notably, we dispense with
computationally intensive pre-processing involving clustering of variables,

guarantee its effective performance and provide bounds on its sample

run the heat flow dynamics for time that is only logarithmic in the problem
dimensions. We explore in detail the interfaces of our approach with key
statistical physics models in network science, such as the Gaussian Free Field

applications to real-world data from a wide array of application domains,

in various solid-state systems. The hydrodynamic behavior of the electronic
fluid reveals itself as a decrease of the electrical resistance with increasing
temperature (the Gurzhi effect) in narrow conducting channels, polynomial
scaling of the resistance as a function of the channel width, substantial
violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law supported by the emergence of the
Poiseuille flow. Similarly to whirlpools in flowing water, the viscous
electronic flow generates vortices, resulting in abnormal sign-changing
electrical response driven by the backflow of electrical current.
Experimentally, the presence of the hydrodynamic vortices was observed in
low-temperature graphene as a negative voltage drop near the current-injecting
contacts. However, the question of whether the long-ranged sign-changing
electrical response can be produced by a mechanism other than hydrodynamics has
not been addressed so far. Here we use polarization-sensitive laser microscopy
to demonstrate the emergence of visually similar abnormal sign-alternating
patterns in charge density in multilayer tungsten ditelluride at room
temperature where this material does not exhibit true electronic hydrodynamics.
We argue that this pseudo-hydrodynamic behavior appears due to a subtle
interplay between the diffusive transport of electrons and holes. In
particular, the sign-alternating charge accumulation in WTe2 is supported by
the unexpected backflow of compressible neutral electron-hole current, which
creates charge-neutral whirlpools in the bulk of this nearly compensated
semimetal. We demonstrate that the exceptionally large spatial size of the
charge domains is sustained by the long recombination time of electron-hole
pairs.

percentage of people are vaccinated. However, vaccine acceptance varies among
communities around the world. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors
affecting public attitudes towards vaccines. Objective: This study aims to
identify if the social media usages factors can be used to predict attitudes
and behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines among the people in the Arab world.
Methods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries and 217 Arab
people participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify
what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and
behavior towards the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants,
56.22% of them were willing to accept the vaccine and 41.47% of them were
hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usages factors were
significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. Whereas
the analysis showed few of the social media usage factors can predict public
attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, frequent social media
users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 is being
exaggerated (OR=2.85, 95% CI=0.86-9.45, p=0.046) than infrequent social media
users. Whereas participants having more trust in vaccine information shared by
their contacts are less likely to agree that decision-makers have verified that
vaccines are safe (OR=0.528, 95% CI= 0.276-1.012, p=0.05). Conclusion: The use
of social media and information shared on it may affect public attitudes
towards COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated
information about COVID-19 and other vaccines on social media is important for
increasing public trust and countering the impact of incorrect and

Selected as metal-poor candidates based on broadband photometry, RAVE collected
moderate-resolution ($R \sim 7,500$) spectra in the region of the Ca triplet
for these stars. About $20\%$ of the stars in this sample also have
medium-resolution ($1,200 \lesssim R \lesssim 2,000$) validation spectra
obtained over a four-year campaign from $2014$ to $2017$ with a variety of
telescopes. We match the candidate stars to photometric metallicity
determinations from the Huang et al. recalibration of the Sky Mapper Southern
Survey Data Release 2. We obtain dynamical clusters of these stars from the
orbital energy and cylindrical actions using the \HDBSCAN ~unsupervised
learning algorithm. We identify $179$ Dynamically Tagged Groups (DTGs) with
between $5$ and $35$ members; $67$ DTGs have at least $10$ member stars. Milky
Way (MW) substructures such as Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, the Metal-Weak Thick
Disk, the Splashed Disk, Thamnos, the Helmi Stream, and LMS-1 (Wukong) are
identified. Associations with MW globular clusters are determined for $10$
DTGs; no recognized MW dwarf galaxies were associated with any of our DTGs.
Previously identified dynamical groups are also associated with our DTGs, with
emphasis placed on their structural determination and possible new
identifications. We identify chemically peculiar stars as members of several
DTGs; we find $22$ DTGs that are associated with \textit{r}-process-enhanced
stars. Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars are identified among the targets
with available spectroscopy, and we assign these to morphological groups
following the approach given by Yoon et al.

multidimensional preferences. Researchers examine how varying a factor of
interest, while controlling for other relevant factors, influences
decision-making. Currently, there exist two methodological approaches to
analyzing data from a conjoint experiment. The first focuses on estimating the
average marginal effects of each factor while averaging over the other factors.
Although this allows for straightforward design-based estimation, the results
critically depend on the distribution of other factors and how interaction
effects are aggregated. An alternative model-based approach can compute various
quantities of interest, but requires researchers to correctly specify the
model, a challenging task for conjoint analysis with many factors and possible
interactions. In addition, a commonly used logistic regression has poor
statistical properties even with a moderate number of factors when
incorporating interactions. We propose a new hypothesis testing approach based
on the conditional randomization test to answer the most fundamental question

emission. The evolution of the magnetic field in the crusts of neutron stars
has been described within the framework of the Hall effect and Ohmic

failure and temperature variations. In the former case, a failed crust does not
completely fulfil the necessary conditions for the Hall effect. In the latter,
the variations of temperature are strongly related to the magnetic field

exoplanets. Even though grazing planetary orbits are rare (due to geometric
selection effects), for many low to moderate signal-to-noise cases, a
significant fraction of the posterior distribution is nonetheless consistent
with a grazing geometry. A failure to accurately model grazing transits can
therefore lead to biased inferences even for cases where the planet is not
actually on a grazing trajectory. With recent advances in stellar
characterization, the limiting factor for many scientific applications is now
the quality of available transit fits themselves, and so the time is ripe to
revisit the transit fitting problem. In this paper, we model exoplanet transits
using a novel application of umbrella sampling and a geometry-dependent
parameter basis that minimizes covariances between transit parameters. Our
technique splits the transit fitting problem into independent Monte Carlo
sampling runs for the grazing, non-grazing, and transition regions of the
parameter space, which we then recombine into a single joint posterior
probability distribution using a robust weighting scheme. Our method can be
trivially parallelized and so requires no increase in the wall clock time
needed for computations. Most importantly, our method produces accurate
estimates of exoplanet properties for both grazing and non-grazing orbits,

provides invaluable insights into the behavior of biomolecules, typically
requires large-scale parallelization. Implementation of fast parallel MD
simulation demands both high bandwidth and low latency for inter-node
communication, but in current semiconductor technology, neither of these
properties is scaling as quickly as intra-node computational capacity. This
disparity in scaling necessitates architectural innovations to maximize the
utilization of computational units. For Anton 3, the latest in a family of
highly successful special-purpose supercomputers designed for MD simulations,
we thus designed and built a completely new specialized network as part of our
ASIC. Tightly integrating this network with specialized computation pipelines
enables Anton 3 to perform simulations orders of magnitude faster than any
general-purpose supercomputer, and to outperform its predecessor, Anton 2 (the
state of the art prior to Anton 3), by an order of magnitude. In this paper, we
present the three key features of the network that contribute to the high
performance of Anton 3. First, through architectural optimizations, the network
achieves very low end-to-end inter-node communication latency for fine-grained
messages, allowing for better overlap of computation and communication. Second,
novel application-specific compression techniques reduce the size of most
messages sent between nodes, thereby increasing effective inter-node bandwidth.
Lastly, a new hardware synchronization primitive, called a network fence,
supports fast fine-grained synchronization tailored to the data flow within a

semi-analytical models of galaxy formation (SAMs), we identify isolated dense

redshift space galaxy catalogues and run a Hickson-like CG finder. We find that
the Hickson-like algorithm in redshift space is poor at recovering 3D CGs of at
least 3 galaxies, with a purity of $\sim 10\%$ and a completeness of $\sim
22\%$. Among the $\sim 90\%$ of spurious systems, typically $60\%$ are dense
structures that failed the 3D isolation criteria, while the remaining $40\%$
are chance alignments of galaxies along the line of sight, nearly all of which
are within regular groups, with some variation with the SAM used for the
analysis. In other words, while only $10\%$ of CGs are isolated dense groups,
as intended, half are dense structures embedded within larger groups, and
one-third are chance alignments within larger groups. The low completeness of
the extracted CG sample is mainly due to the flux limits of the selection
criteria. Our results suggest that a new observational algorithm to identify
compact groups in redshift space is required to obtain dense isolated galaxy
systems.

energy to reduce CO$_2$ with H$_2$O, extracting energy and producing O$_2$ as
waste. O$_2$ production from this metabolic process was so vigorous that it
saturated its photochemical sinks, permitting it to reach ""runaway"" conditions
and rapidly accumulate in the atmosphere despite its reactivity. Here we argue
that O$_2$ may not be unique: diverse gases produced by life may experience a
""runaway"" effect similar to O$_2$. This runaway occurs because the ability of
an atmosphere to photochemically cleanse itself of trace gases is generally
finite. If produced at rates exceeding this finite limit, even reactive gases
can rapidly accumulate to high concentrations and become potentially
detectable. Planets orbiting smaller, cooler stars, such as the M dwarfs that
are the prime targets for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), are especially
favorable for runaway due to their lower UV emission compared to higher-mass
stars. As an illustrative case study, we show that on a habitable exoplanet
with an H$_2$-N$_2$ atmosphere and net surface production of NH$_3$ orbiting an
M dwarf (the ""Cold Haber World"" scenario), the reactive biogenic gas NH$_3$ can
enter runaway, whereupon an increase in the surface production flux of one
order of magnitude can increase NH$_3$ concentrations by three orders of
magnitude and render it detectable by JWST in just two transits. Our work on
this and other gases suggests that diverse signs of life on exoplanets may be
readily detectable at biochemically plausible production rates.

AGN jet angle with respect to the galactic disk affect the morphology and
content of the resulting galactic outflow. For low power AGN across three
orders of magnitude of AGN luminosities ($10^{41}-10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) our
simulations did not show significant changes to either the morphology or total
mass of the outflow. Changing the angle of the AGN jet with respect to the
galaxy did show small changes in the total outflow mass of a factor of 2-3.
Jets perpendicular to the galactic disk were created hot single phase outflows,
while jets close to parallel with the disk created the outflows were
multi-phase with equal parts warm and hot, and significant cold gas. Overall
The final morphology of low power AGN outflows depends primarily on how the jet
impacts and interacts with large, dense clouds in the clumpy ISM. These clouds
can disrupt, deflect, split, or suppress the jet preventing it from leaving the
galactic disk as a coherent structure. But for simulations with AGN
luminosities $> 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ the ISM played a minor role in
determining the morphology of the outflow with an undisrupted jet leaving the
disk. The final morphology of AGN outflows is different for low power AGNs vs.
high power AGNs with the final morphology of low power AGN outflows dependent
on the ISM structure within the first kpc surrounding the AGN.

(nodes). In this model, a source keeps the most up-to-date information about a
time-varying binary state of the world, and $n$ receiver nodes want to follow
the information at the source as accurately as possible. When the information
at the source changes, the source first sends updates to a subset of $m\leq n$
nodes. After that, the nodes share their local information during the gossiping
period to disseminate the information further. The nodes then estimate the
information at the source using the majority rule at the end of the gossiping
period. To analyze information dissemination, we introduce a new error metric
to find the average percentage of nodes that can accurately obtain the most
up-to-date information at the source. We characterize the equations necessary
to obtain the steady-state distribution for the average error and then analyze
the system behavior under both high and low gossip rates. In the high gossip
rate, in which each node can access other nodes' information more frequently,
we show that the nodes update their information based on the majority of the
information in the network. In the low gossip rate, we introduce and analyze
the gossip gain, which is the reduction at the average error due to gossiping.
In particular, we develop an adaptive policy that the source can use to
determine its current transmission capacity $m$ based on its past transmission
rates and the accuracy of the information at the nodes. In numerical results,
we show that when the source's transmission capacity $m$ is limited, gossiping
can be harmful as it causes incorrect information to disseminate. We then find
the optimal gossip rates to minimize the average error for a fixed $m$.
Finally, we illustrate the outperformance of our adaptive policy compared to
the constant $m$-selection policy even for the high gossip rates.

a (large-dimensional) set of control variables using machine learning
techniques. The conditional RC-density allows to disentangle observable from
unobservable heterogeneity in partial effects of continuous treatments adding
to a growing literature on heterogeneous effect estimation using machine
learning. %It is also informative of the conditional potential outcome

a closed-form sieve approximation of the conditional RC density is derived
where each sieve coefficient can be expressed as conditional expectation
function varying with controls. Second, sieve coefficients are estimated with
generic machine learning procedures and under appropriate sample splitting
rules. The $L_2$-convergence rate of the conditional RC-density estimator is
derived. The rate is slower by a factor then typical rates of mean regression
machine learning estimators which is due to the ill-posedness of the RC density
estimation problem. The performance and applicability of the estimator is
illustrated using random forest algorithms over a range of Monte Carlo
simulations and with real data from the SOEP-IS. Here behavioral heterogeneity
in an economic experiment on portfolio choice is studied. The method reveals
two types of behavior in the population, one type complying with economic
theory and one not. The assignment to types appears largely based on

our detection methods are insensitive to moderate-mass planets on wide orbits.
However, debris discs can probe the outer-planet population, because dynamical
modelling of observed discs can reveal properties of perturbing planets. We use
four sculpting and stirring arguments to infer planet properties in 178
debris-disc systems from the ISPY, LEECH and LIStEN planet-hunting surveys.
Similar analyses are often conducted for individual discs, but we consider a
large sample in a consistent manner. We aim to predict the population of
wide-separation planets, gain insight into the formation and evolution
histories of planetary systems, and determine the feasibility of detecting
these planets in the near future. We show that a `typical' cold debris disc
likely requires a Neptune- to Saturn-mass planet at 10-100 au, with some
needing Jupiter-mass perturbers. Our predicted planets are currently
undetectable, but modest detection-limit improvements (e.g. from JWST) should
reveal many such perturbers. We find that planets thought to be perturbing
debris discs at late times are similar to those inferred to be forming in
protoplanetary discs, so these could be the same population if newly formed
planets do not migrate as far as currently thought. Alternatively, young
planets could rapidly sculpt debris before migrating inwards, meaning that the
responsible planets are more massive (and located further inwards) than
debris-disc studies assume. We combine self-stirring and size-distribution
modelling to show that many debris discs cannot be self-stirred without having
unreasonably high masses; planet- or companion-stirring may therefore be the
dominant mechanism in many (perhaps all) debris discs. Finally, we provide
catalogues of planet predictions, and identify promising targets for future
planet searches.

for user-space programs, the corresponding OS kernel's KASLR support remains
very limited, making the kernel vulnerable to just-in-time (JIT)
return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Furthermore, commodity OSs such as
Linux restrict their KASLR range to 32 bits due to architectural constraints
(e.g., x86-64 only supports 32-bit immediate operands for most instructions),
which makes them vulnerable to even unsophisticated brute-force ROP attacks due
to low entropy. Most in-kernel pointers remain static, exacerbating the problem
when pointers are leaked.
  Adelie, our kernel defense mechanism, overcomes KASLR limitations, increases
KASLR entropy, and makes successful ROP attacks on the Linux kernel much harder
to achieve. First, Adelie enables the position-independent code (PIC) model so
that the kernel and its modules can be placed anywhere in the 64-bit virtual
address space, at any distance apart from each other. Second, Adelie implements
stack re-randomization and address encryption on modules. Finally, Adelie
enables efficient continuous KASLR for modules by using the PIC model to make
it (almost) impossible to inject ROP gadgets through these modules regardless
of gadget's origin.
  Since device drivers (typically compiled as modules) are often developed by
third parties and are typically less tested than core OS parts, they are also
often more vulnerable. By fully re-randomizing device drivers, the last two
contributions together prevent most JIT ROP attacks since vulnerable modules
are very likely to be a starting point of an attack. Furthermore, some OS
instances in virtualized environments are specifically designated to run device
drivers, where drivers are the primary target of JIT ROP attacks. Our
evaluation shows high efficiency of Adelie's approach.

study of over 2300 nearby galaxies in the near-infrared (NIR), which has been
critical to our understanding of the detailed structures of nearby galaxies.
Because the sample galaxies were selected only using radio-derived velocities,
however, the survey favored late-type disk galaxies over lenticulars and
ellipticals. A follow-up Spitzer survey was conducted to rectify this bias,
adding 465 early-type galaxies (ETGs) to the original sample, to be analyzed in
a manner consistent with the initial survey. We present the data release of
this ETG extension, up to the third data processing pipeline (P3): surface
photometry. We produce curves of growth and radial surface brightness profiles
(with and without inclination corrections) using reduced and masked Spitzer
IRAC 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m images produced through Pipelines 1 and 2,
respectively. From these profiles, we derive the following integrated
quantities: total magnitudes, stellar masses, concentration parameters, and
galaxy size metrics. We showcase NIR scaling relations for ETGs among these
quantities. We examine general trends across the whole S$^{4}$G and ETG
extension among our derived parameters, highlighting differences between ETGs
and late-type galaxies (LTGs). ETGs are, on average, more massive and more
concentrated than LTGs, and also show subtle distinctions among ETG
morphological sub-types. We also derive the following scaling relations and
compare with previous results in visible light: mass--size (both half-light and
isophotal), mass--concentration, mass--surface brightness (central, effective,
and within 1 kpc), and mass--color. We find good agreement with previous works,

entanglement entropy coincides with entanglement cost, the case for mixed

this approach elegantly yields the solution of the infamous cosmological

tidal shear of a massive black hole (MBH). The accumulation of TDE observations
over the last years has revealed that post-starburst galaxies are significantly
overrepresented in the sample of TDE hosts. Here we address the post-starburst
preference by investigating the decline of TDE rates in a Milky-Way like
nuclear stellar cluster featuring either a monochromatic (1 M$\odot$) or a
complete, evolved stellar mass function. In the former case, the decline of TDE
rates with time is very mild, and generally up to a factor of a few in 10 Gyr.
Conversely, if a complete mass function is considered, a strong TDE burst over
the first 0.1-1 Gyr is followed by a considerable rate drop, by at least an
order of magnitude over 10 Gyr. The decline starts after a mass segregation
time-scale, and it is more pronounced assuming a more top-heavy initial mass
function and/or an initially denser nucleus. Our results thus suggest that the
post-starburst preference can be accounted for in realistic systems featuring a
complete stellar mass function, even in moderately dense galactic nuclei.
Overall, our findings support the idea that starbursting galactic nuclei are
characterized by a top-heavy initial mass function; we speculate that
accounting for this can reconcile the discrepancy between observed and
theoretically predicted TDE rates even in quiescent galaxies.

One way to explain this result is that member galaxies at high redshift tend to
have more cold gas. While BCGs in nearby galaxy clusters grow mostly by dry
mergers with cluster members, leading to no increase in AGN activity, BCGs at
high redshift could primarily merge with gas-rich satellites, providing fuel
for feeding AGNs. If this observed increase in AGN activity is linked to
gas-rich mergers, rather than ICM cooling, we would expect to see an increase
in scatter in the P_cav vs L_cool relation at z > 1. Lastly, this work confirms
that the runaway cooling phase, as predicted by the classical cooling flow
model, in the Phoenix cluster is extremely rare and most BCGs have low
(relative to Eddington) black hole accretion rates.

supermassive black-hole (BH) binary, taking into account the general
relativistic effect induced by the BH spin. When the BH spin is significant
compared to and misaligned with the binary orbital angular momentum, the
orbital axis ($\hat{\mathbf{l}}$) of the circumbinary star can undergo
significant evolution during the binary orbital decay driven by gravitational
radiation. Including the spin effect of the primary (more massive) BH, we find
that starting from nearly coplanar orbital orientations, the orbital axes
$\hat{\mathbf{l}}$ of circumbinary stars preferentially evolve towards the spin
direction after the merger of the BH binary, regardless of the initial BH spin
orientation. Such alignment phenomenon, i.e., small final misalignment angle
between $\hat{\mathbf{l}}$ and the spin axis of the remanent BH
$\hat{\mathbf{S}}$, can be understood analytically using the principle of
adiabatic invariance. For the BH binaries with extremely mass ratio
($m_2/m_1\lesssim0.01$), $\hat{\mathbf{l}}$ may experience more complicated
evolution as adiabatic invariance breaks down, but the trend of alignment still
works reasonably well when the initial binary spin-orbit angle is relatively
small. Our result suggests that the correlation between the orientations of
stellar orbits and the spin axis of the central BH could provide a potential
signature of the merger history of the massive BH.

size, formation time, strength, and pattern speed influence the dynamical

have been limited by the classic trade off between simulation volume and
resolution. Here we analyze barred disk galaxies in the cosmological
magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and quantitatively compare the
distributions of bar size and pattern speed to those from MaNGA observations at
$z=0$. TNG50 galaxies are selected to match the stellar mass and size
distributions of observed galaxies, to account for observational selection
effects. We find that the high-resolution of TNG50 yields bars with a wide
range of pattern speeds (including those with $\geq
40~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\,$\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$) and a mean value of
$\sim36~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$ consistent with
observations within $6\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\,$\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$, in
contrast with previous lower-resolution cosmological simulations that produced
bars that were too slow. We find, however, that bars in TNG50 are on average
$\sim 35\%$ shorter than observed, although this discrepancy may partly reflect
remaining inconsistencies in the simulation-data comparison. This leads to
higher values of $\mathcal{R} = R_\mathrm{corot}/R_\mathrm{bar}$ in TNG50, but
points to simulated bars being `too short' rather than `too slow'. After
repeating the analysis on the lower-resolution run of the same simulation (with
the same physical model), we qualitatively reproduce the results obtained in
previous studies: this implies that, along with physical model variations,
numerical resolution effects may explain the previously found `slowness' of
simulated bars.

jet anisotropy which in turn can provide insight into the path-length
dependence of jet quenching. This is investigated within the Linear Boltzmann
Transport (LBT) model which simulates both elastic scattering and
medium-induced gluon radiation based on perturbative QCD for jet shower and
medium recoil partons as well as radiated gluons as they propagate through the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The dynamical evolution of the QGP in each event of
heavy-ion collisions is provided by the (3+1)D CLVisc hydrodynamic model with
fully fluctuating initial conditions. This framework has been shown to describe
the suppression of single inclusive jet spectra well. We calculate in this
study the elliptic ($v_{2}^{\rm jet}$) and triangular ($v_{3}^{\rm jet}$)
anisotropy coefficients of the single inclusive jet spectra in Pb+Pb collisions
at the LHC energies. We investigate the colliding energy, centrality, jet
transverse momentum dependence of the jet anisotropy, as well as their
event-by-event correlation with the flow coefficients of the soft bulk hadrons.
An approximate linear correlation between jet and bulk $v_2$ is found. Effect
of the bulk $v_n$ fluctuation on $v_n^{\rm jet}$ is found negligible. The
jet-induced medium excitation, which is influenced by radial flow, is shown to
enhance $v_{2}^{\rm jet}$ and the enhancement increases with the jet cone size.
The jet elliptic anisotropy $v_{2}^{\rm jet}$ is also found to be slightly
enhanced by the shear viscosity of the bulk medium in comparison to the LBT
results when jets propagate through an ideal hydrodynamic QGP medium.

i.e.~singlets under the Gauss law for Chern-Simons gauge theory. Via the
Chern-Simons / WZW correspondence, the space of quantum singlets are equivalent
to the space of WZW conformal blocks. One step in our demonstration involves
recasting the Verlinde formula for the dimension of the space of conformal

Chern-Simons matter theories to quantum (or WZW) singlets is the `Bosonic
Exclusion Principle': the number of bosons occupying any single particle state
is bounded above by the Chern-Simons level. The quantum singlet condition
(unlike its Yang-Mills Gauss Law counterpart) has a nontrivial impact on
thermodynamics even in the infinite volume limit. In this limit the projected
Fock space partition function reduces to a product of partition functions, one
for each single particle state. These single particle state partition functions
are $q$-deformations of their free boson and free fermion counterparts and
interpolate between these two special cases. We also propose a formula for the
large $N$ partition function that is valid for arbitrary finite volume of the

homogenization is a process where the system state approaches the identically
prepared state of bath unit in the asymptotic limit. Here, we study the
homogenization process for non-Markovian collisional model generated via
additional bath-bath interaction. With partial swap operation as both
system-bath and bath-bath unitary, we show that homogenization is achieved
irrespective of the initial states of the system or bath units. This is
reminiscent of the Markovian scenario, where partial swap is the unique
operation for a universal quantum homogenizer. On the other hand, we observe
that the rate of homogenization is slower than its Markovian counter part.

considering both armchair and zigzag variants of twenty-seven select Janus TMD
nanotubes, we determine the change in bandgap and charge carriers' effective
mass upon axial and torsional deformations using density functional theory
(DFT). We observe that metallic nanotubes remain unaffected, whereas the
bandgap in semiconducting nanotubes decreases linearly and quadratically with
axial and shear strains, respectively, leading to semiconductor--metal
transitions. In addition, we find that there is a continuous decrease and
increase in the effective mass of holes and electrons with strains,
respectively, leading to n-type--p-type semiconductor transitions. We show that
this behavior is a consequence of the rehybridization of orbitals, rather than
charge transfer between the atoms. Overall, mechanical deformations form a
powerful tool for tailoring the electronic response of semiconducting Janus TMD

that during training and testing SDC modulates network parameters continuously

transit depth of spectral features. However, additional factors such as band
overlap with CO2 and other gases, extinction by mineral dust, overlap of

supernova (SN) associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is unclear. To study
that, we explore observational signatures of stellar explosions that are driven
by jets. We focus on the final velocity distribution of the outflow in such
explosions and compare its observational imprints to SN/GRB data. We find that
jet driven explosions produce an outflow with a flat distribution of energy per
logarithmic scale of proper velocity. The flat distribution seems to be
universal as it is independent of the jet and the progenitor properties that we
explored. The velocity range of the flat distribution for typical GRB
parameters is $\gamma\beta \approx 0.03-3$, where $\gamma$ is the outflow
Lorentz factor and $\beta$ is its dimensionless velocity. A flat distribution
is seen also for collimated choked jets where the highest outflow velocity
decreases with the depth at which the jet is choked. Comparison to observations
of SN/GRBs rules out jets as the sole explosion source in these events.
Instead, in SN/GRB the collapsing star must deposit its energy into two
channels - a quasi-spherical (or wide angle) channel and a narrowly collimated
one. The former carries most of the energy and is responsible for the SN
sub-relativistic ejecta while the latter carries 0.01-0.1 of the total outflow
energy and is the source of the GRB. Intriguingly, the same two channels, with
a similar energy ratio, were seen in the binary neutron star merger GW170817,
suggesting that similar engines are at work in both phenomena.

\mathbb{R}^m$ with a fixed noise level $\sigma>0$, we consider the problem of
estimating the unknown signal $\mu_0$ under a convex constraint $\mu_0 \in K$,
where $K$ is a closed convex set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show that the risk of
the natural convex constrained least squares estimator (LSE)
$\hat{\mu}(\sigma)$ can be characterized exactly in high dimensional limits, by
that of the convex constrained LSE $\hat{\mu}_K^{\mathsf{seq}}$ in the
corresponding Gaussian sequence model at a different noise level. The
characterization holds (uniformly) for risks in the maximal regime that ranges
from constant order all the way down to essentially the parametric rate, as
long as certain necessary non-degeneracy condition is satisfied for
$\hat{\mu}(\sigma)$.
  The precise risk characterization reveals a fundamental difference between
noiseless (or low noise limit) and noisy linear inverse problems in terms of
the sample complexity for signal recovery. A concrete example is given by the
isotonic regression problem: While exact recovery of a general monotone signal
requires $m\gg n^{1/3}$ samples in the noiseless setting, consistent signal
recovery in the noisy setting requires as few as $m\gg \log n$ samples. Such a
discrepancy occurs when the low and high noise risk behavior of
$\hat{\mu}_K^{\mathsf{seq}}$ differ significantly. In statistical languages,
this occurs when $\hat{\mu}_K^{\mathsf{seq}}$ estimates $0$ at a faster
`adaptation rate' than the slower `worst-case rate' for general signals.
Several other examples, including non-negative least squares and generalized
Lasso (in constrained forms), are also worked out to demonstrate the concrete
applicability of the theory in problems of different types.

test problems are considered to demonstrate the SLCP algorithm, comparing it
with SQP and the modified Logspace Sequential Quadratic Programming (LSQP). In
these cases, SLCP shows up to a 77% reduction in number of iterations compared
to SQP, and an 11% reduction compared to LSQP. The airfoil analysis code XFOIL
is integrated into one of the case studies to show how SLCP can be used to
evolve the fidelity of design problems that have initially been modeled as GP
compatible. Finally, a methodology for design based on GP and SLCP is briefly
discussed.

features of vulnerable code from a large and real-world Python codebase. VUDENC
applies a word2vec model to identify semantically similar code tokens and to
provide a vector representation. A network of long-short-term memory cells

fine-grained level, highlight the specific areas in the source code that are
likely to contain vulnerabilities, and provide confidence levels for its
predictions. Results: To evaluate VUDENC, we used 1,009 vulnerability-fixing
commits from different GitHub repositories that contain seven different types
of vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, Command injection, XSRF, Remote code

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Prescribing optimal operation based on the condition of the system and,
thereby, potentially prolonging the remaining useful lifetime has a large
potential for actively managing the availability, maintenance and costs of
complex systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are particularly
suitable for this type of problems given their learning capabilities. A special
case of a prescriptive operation is the power allocation task, which can be
considered as a sequential allocation problem, where the action space is
bounded by a simplex constraint. A general continuous action-space solution of
such sequential allocation problems has still remained an open research
question for RL algorithms. In continuous action-space, the standard Gaussian
policy applied in reinforcement learning does not support simplex constraints,
while the Gaussian-softmax policy introduces a bias during training. In this
work, we propose the Dirichlet policy for continuous allocation tasks and
analyze the bias and variance of its policy gradients. We demonstrate that the
Dirichlet policy is bias-free and provides significantly faster convergence,
better performance and better hyperparameters robustness over the
Gaussian-softmax policy. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of the
proposed algorithm on a prescriptive operation case, where we propose the
Dirichlet power allocation policy and evaluate the performance on a case study
of a set of multiple lithium-ion (Li-I) battery systems. The experimental
results show the potential to prescribe optimal operation, improve the
efficiency and sustainability of multi-power source systems.

The different methods that are currently available to assess the amount of TeNT

measuring linguistic biases against social groups such as ethnic minorities in
large text corpora. It does so by comparing the semantic relatedness of words
prototypical of the groups (e.g., names unique to those groups) and attribute
words (e.g., 'pleasant' and 'unpleasant' words). We show that anti-black WEAT
estimates from geo-tagged social media data at the level of metropolitan
statistical areas strongly correlate with several measures of racial
animus--even when controlling for sociodemographic covariates. However, we also
show that every one of these correlations is explained by a third variable: the
frequency of Black names in the underlying corpora relative to White names.
This occurs because word embeddings tend to group positive (negative) words and
frequent (rare) words together in the estimated semantic space. As the
frequency of Black names on social media is strongly correlated with Black
Americans' prevalence in the population, this results in spurious anti-Black
WEAT estimates wherever few Black Americans live. This suggests that research
using the WEAT to measure bias should consider term frequency, and also
demonstrates the potential consequences of using black-box models like word
embeddings to study human cognition and behavior.

and dynamical evolution of molecular clouds, as they control the ionisation,
dissociation, and excitation of H$_{2}$. Their characterisation is important
both for the interpretation of observations and for the development of
theoretical models. The methods used so far for estimating the CR ionisation
rate ($\zeta$) in molecular clouds have several limitations due to
uncertainties in the adopted chemical networks. We refine and extend the method
proposed by Bialy (2020) to estimate $\zeta$ by observing rovibrational
transitions of H$_{2}$ at near-infrared wavelengths, which are mainly excited
by secondary CR electrons. Combining models of interstellar CR propagation and
attenuation with the calculation of the expected secondary electron spectrum
and updated H$_{2}$ excitation cross sections by electron collisions, we derive
the intensity of the four H$_{2}$ rovibrational transitions observable in
dense, cold gas: (1-0)O(2), (1-0)Q(2), (1-0)S(0), and (1-0)O(4). The proposed
method allows the estimation of $\zeta$ for a given observed line intensity and
H$_{2}$ column density. We are also able to deduce the shape of the low-energy
CR proton spectrum impinging upon the molecular cloud. We present a look-up
plot and a web-based application that can be used to constrain the low-energy
spectral slope of the interstellar CR proton spectrum. We comment on the
capability of the James Webb Space Telescope to detect these near-infrared
H$_{2}$ lines, making it possible to derive for the first time spatial
variation of $\zeta$ in dense gas. Besides the implications for the
interpretation of the chemical-dynamic evolution of a molecular cloud, it will
be possible to test competing models of CR propagation and attenuation in the
interstellar medium, as well as compare CR spectra in different Galactic

  Results: The findings presented in this study demonstrate a significant
correlation between the sentiments of the tweets and the vaccination rate in

Polytope, a language extension to C++ that aims to make efficient privilege

policy and instruments an IR with code to enforce the source-level policy using
Intel MPK. A run-time support library manages partitions, protection keys,
dynamic memory operations, and indirect call target privileges. An evaluation
demonstrates that Polytope provides equivalent protection to prior systems with
a low annotation burden and comparable performance overhead. Polytope also
renders privilege leaks that contradict intended policy impossible to express.

rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based secure beamforming design, where
user messages are split and encoded into common and private streams. Each user
not only decodes the common stream and the intended private stream, but also
tries to eavesdrop the private streams of other users. We formulate a weighted
sum-rate (WSR) maximization problem subject to the secrecy rate requirements of
all users. To tackle the non-convexity of the formulated problem, a successive
convex approximation (SCA)-based approach is adopted to convert the original
non-convex and intractable problem into a low-complexity suboptimal iterative
algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed secure beamforming

classifiers. A victim classifier will predict to an attacker-desired target
class whenever a test sample is embedded with the same backdoor pattern (BP)
that was used to poison the classifier's training set. Detecting whether a
classifier is backdoor attacked is not easy in practice, especially when the
defender is, e.g., a downstream user without access to the classifier's
training set. This challenge is addressed here by a reverse-engineering defense
(RED), which has been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in several
domains. However, existing REDs are not applicable when there are only {\it two
classes} or when {\it multiple attacks} are present. These scenarios are first
studied in the current paper, under the practical constraints that the defender
neither has access to the classifier's training set nor to supervision from
clean reference classifiers trained for the same domain. We propose a detection
framework based on BP reverse-engineering and a novel {\it expected
transferability} (ET) statistic. We show that our ET statistic is effective
{\it using the same detection threshold}, irrespective of the classification

the gap between the difficulty in developing efficient FPGA accelerators and

ultra-fast GNN inference without any graph pre-processing for real-time

extensibility to flexibly adapt to new models. The framework features an
optimized message-passing structure applicable to all models, combined with a
rich library of model-specific components. We verify our implementation

achieve satisfactory performance with relatively low complexity. Typically,
these deep-unfolding NNs are restricted to a fixed-depth for all inputs.
However, the optimal number of layers required for convergence changes with
different inputs. In this paper, we first develop a framework of deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-driven deep-unfolding with adaptive depth
for different inputs, where the trainable parameters of deep-unfolding NN are
learned by DDPG, rather than updated by the stochastic gradient descent
algorithm directly. Specifically, the optimization variables, trainable
parameters, and architecture of deep-unfolding NN are designed as the state,
action, and state transition of DDPG, respectively. Then, this framework is
employed to deal with the channel estimation problem in massive multiple-input
multiple-output systems. Specifically, first of all we formulate the channel
estimation problem with an off-grid basis and develop a sparse Bayesian
learning (SBL)-based algorithm to solve it. Secondly, the SBL-based algorithm
is unfolded into a layer-wise structure with a set of introduced trainable
parameters. Thirdly, the proposed DDPG-driven deep-unfolding framework is
employed to solve this channel estimation problem based on the unfolded
structure of the SBL-based algorithm. To realize adaptive depth, we design the
halting score to indicate when to stop, which is a function of the channel
reconstruction error. Furthermore, the proposed framework is extended to
realize the adaptive depth of the general deep neural networks (DNNs).
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
conventional optimization algorithms and DNNs with fixed depth with much
reduced number of layers.

  Embedding Methods on Community Labeling",,,,,"cs.SI cs.AI cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph representation learning (also called graph embeddings) is a popular
technique for incorporating network structure into machine learning models.
Unsupervised graph embedding methods aim to capture graph structure by learning
a low-dimensional vector representation (the embedding) for each node. Despite
the widespread use of these embeddings for a variety of downstream transductive
machine learning tasks, there is little principled analysis of the
effectiveness of this approach for common tasks. In this work, we provide an
empirical and theoretical analysis for the performance of a class of embeddings
on the common task of pairwise community labeling. This is a binary variant of
the classic community detection problem, which seeks to build a classifier to
determine whether a pair of vertices participate in a community. In line with
our goal of foundational understanding, we focus on a popular class of
unsupervised embedding techniques that learn low rank factorizations of a
vertex proximity matrix (this class includes methods like GraRep, DeepWalk,
node2vec, NetMF). We perform detailed empirical analysis for community labeling
over a variety of real and synthetic graphs with ground truth. In all cases we
studied, the models trained from embedding features perform poorly on community
labeling. In constrast, a simple logistic model with classic graph structural
features handily outperforms the embedding models. For a more principled
understanding, we provide a theoretical analysis for the (in)effectiveness of
these embeddings in capturing the community structure. We formally prove that
popular low-dimensional factorization methods either cannot produce community
structure, or can only produce ``unstable"" communities. These communities are
inherently unstable under small perturbations.

a challenging task due to the highly irregular cadence, long time gaps,
missing-values, few observations, etc. These issues are particularly
detrimental to the analysis of transient events: SN-like light-curves. We offer
three main contributions: 1) Based on temporal modulation and attention
mechanisms, we propose a Deep attention model (TimeModAttn) to classify
multi-band light-curves of different SN types, avoiding photometric or
hand-crafted feature computations, missing-value assumptions, and explicit
imputation/interpolation methods. 2) We propose a model for the synthetic
generation of SN multi-band light-curves based on the Supernova Parametric
Model, allowing us to increase the number of samples and the diversity of
cadence. Thus, the TimeModAttn model is first pre-trained using synthetic
light-curves. Then, a fine-tuning process is performed. The TimeModAttn model
outperformed other Deep Learning models, based on Recurrent Neural Networks, in
two scenarios: late-classification and early-classification. Also, the
TimeModAttn model outperformed a Balanced Random Forest (BRF) classifier
(trained with real data), increasing the balanced-$F_1$score from $\approx.525$
to $\approx.596$. When training the BRF with synthetic data, this model
achieved similar performance to the TimeModAttn model proposed while still
maintaining extra advantages. 3) We conducted interpretability experiments.
High attention scores were obtained for observations earlier than and close to
the SN brightness peaks. This also correlated with an early highly variability
of the learned temporal modulation.

the experimental settings. The stochastic independence of hidden and setting
variables is called: freedom of choice, free will, measurement independence or
no conspiracy. By imbedding the Bell causal structure in a larger causal
network the authors correctly prove, that one can explain and quantify possible
violation of measurement independence without evoking the super-determinism.
They assume the independence of the variables that causally determine the
settings and investigate how they might become correlated with hidden
variables. Using their extended causal networks they derive a contextual
probabilistic model on which their further correct results are based. The
authors seem to ignore that contextual probabilistic model may be derived
directly using only probabilistic concepts and incorporating correctly setting
dependent variables describing measuring instruments. In these contextual
probabilistic models experimenters freedom of choice is not compromised and the
results of Bell Tests including an apparent violation of Einsteinian
nonsignaling may be explained in a locally causal way. Talking about freedom of
choice is misleading and is rooted in incorrect understanding of Bayes Theorem.
We explain why freedom of choice should be called noncontextuality and why its
violation in Bell Tests confirms only the contextual character of quantum
observables. Therefore, contextuality and not experimenters freedom of choice
are important resources in quantum information.

$0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ and $0.01 \pm 0.01$, respectively and find that $\gtrsim

rich collaborative learning between multiple clients, without sharing user
data. This is done via a central server that aggregates learning in the form of
weight updates. However, this comes at the cost of repeated expensive
communication between the clients and the server, and concerns about
compromised user privacy. The inversion of gradients into the data that
generated them is termed data leakage. Encryption techniques can be used to
counter this leakage, but at added expense. To address these challenges of
communication efficiency and privacy, we propose TOFU, a novel algorithm which
generates proxy data that encodes the weight updates for each client in its
gradients. Instead of weight updates, this proxy data is now shared. Since
input data is far lower in dimensional complexity than weights, this encoding
allows us to send much lesser data per communication round. Additionally, the
proxy data resembles noise, and even perfect reconstruction from data leakage
attacks would invert the decoded gradients into unrecognizable noise, enhancing
privacy. We show that TOFU enables learning with less than 1% and 7% accuracy
drops on MNIST and on CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. This drop can be
recovered via a few rounds of expensive encrypted gradient exchange. This
enables us to learn to near-full accuracy in a federated setup, while being 4x
and 6.6x more communication efficient than the standard Federated Averaging
algorithm on MNIST and CIFAR-10, respectively.

can experience various kinds of collective effects in flavor space, engendered
by neutrino-neutrino interactions. These include ""bipolar"" collective
oscillations, which are exhibited by neutrino ensembles where different flavors
dominate at different energies. Considering the importance of neutrinos in the
dynamics and nucleosynthesis in these environments, it is desirable to
ascertain whether an Earth-based detection could contain signatures of bipolar
oscillations that occurred within a supernova envelope. To that end, we
continue examining a cost-function formulation of statistical data assimilation
(SDA) to infer solutions to a small-scale model of neutrino flavor
transformation. SDA is an inference paradigm designed to optimize a model with
sparse data. Our model consists of two mono-energetic neutrino beams with
different energies emanating from a source and coherently interacting with each
other and with a matter background, with time-varying interaction strengths. We
attempt to infer flavor transformation histories of these beams using simulated
measurements of the flavor content at locations in vacuum (that is, far from
the source), which could in principle correspond to earth-based detectors.
Within the scope of this small-scale model, we found that: (i) based on such
measurements, the SDA procedure is able to infer \textit{whether} bipolar
oscillations had occurred within the protoneutron star envelope, and (ii) if
the measurements are able to sample the full amplitude of the neutrino
oscillations in vacuum, then the amplitude of the prior bipolar oscillations is
also well predicted. This result intimates that the inference paradigm can well
complement numerical integration codes, via its ability to infer flavor
evolution at physically inaccessible locations.

recently been reported that the hot Jupiter WASP-77 A b has sub-solar
atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances with a solar C/O abundance ratio.
Assuming solar carbon and oxygen abundances for its host star WASP-77 A,
WASP-77 A b's atmospheric carbon and oxygen abundances possibly indicate that
it accreted its envelope interior to its parent protoplanetary disk's H2O ice
line from carbon-depleted gas with little subsequent planetesimal accretion or
core erosion. We comprehensively model WASP-77 A and use our results to better
characterize WASP-77 A b. We show that the photospheric abundances of carbon
and oxygen in WASP-77 A are super-solar with a sub-solar C/O abundance ratio,
implying that WASP-77 A b's atmosphere has significantly sub-stellar carbon and
oxygen abundances with a super-stellar C/O ratio. Our result possibly indicates
that WASP-77 A b's envelope was accreted by the planet beyond its parent
protoplanetary disk's H2O ice line. While numerous theoretical complications to
these idealized models have now been identified, the possibility of non-solar
protoplanetary disk abundance ratios confound even the most sophisticated
protoplanetary disk and giant planet formation models. We therefore argue that
giant planet atmospheric abundance ratios can only be meaningfully interpreted
relative to the possibly non-solar mean compositions of their parent
protoplanetary disks as recorded in the photospheric abundances of their
solar-type dwarf host stars.

make our theoretical analysis feasible, we focus on the case of
one-hidden-layer neural networks. However, theoretical understanding of
iterative self-training is non-trivial even for a shallow neural network. One
of the key challenges is that existing neural network landscape analysis built
upon supervised learning no longer holds in the (semi-supervised) self-training
paradigm. We address this challenge and prove that iterative self-training
converges linearly with both convergence rate and generalization accuracy
improved in the order of $1/\sqrt{M}$, where $M$ is the number of unlabeled
samples. Experiments from shallow neural networks to deep neural networks are
also provided to justify the correctness of our established theoretical
insights on self-training.

aberration corrector. Several formulas for the focal length and spherical
aberration coefficients in the thin-lens approximation are derived to set the
lens properties and associated light beam parameters. When the mode field of
the optical beam is small, the electron trajectory calculation results show
properties similar to those obtained using the formulas. Alternatively, large

the potential. The second- and higher-order Bessel and Laguerre-Gaussian beams
produce no focusing power and no negative third-order spherical aberration;

correctors. Results show that the ponderomotive potential-based electron lens

their transport and mixing properties. Counter-rotating vortex pairs can travel
long distances and carry trapped fluid as they move. These structures are often
modeled as hetons, viz. counter-rotating quasigeostrophic point vortex pairs
with equal circulations. Here, we investigate the structure of the transport
induced by a single three-dimensional heton. The transport is determined by the
Hamiltonian structure of the velocity field induced by the heton's component
vortices. The dynamics displays a sequence of bifurcations as one moves through
the heton-induced velocity field in height. These bifurcations create and
destroy unstable fixed points whose associated invariant manifolds bound the
trapped volume. Heton configurations fall into three categories. Vertically
aligned hetons do not move and do not transport fluid. Horizontally aligned
hetons have a single parameter, the horizontal vortex half-separation $Y$, and
simple scaling shows the dimensional trapped volume scales as $Y^3$. Tilted
hetons are described by two parameters, $Y$ and the vertical vortex
half-separation $Z$, rendering the scaling analysis more complex. A scaling
theory is developed for the trapped volume of tilted hetons showing that it
scales as $Z^4/Y$ for large $Z$. Numerical calculations illustrate the
structure of the trapped volume and verify the scaling theory.

incoherent $\phi$ photoproduction data of $\gamma d \rightarrow \phi p n$, we

of VMD model and a low energy QCD theorem, we find that the neutron mass radius
is consistent with the proton mass radius within the current statistical
uncertainties, and that the nuclear modification on the nucleon mass radius is
small inside the deuteron.

a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability problem. This enables us to leverage HJ
reachability tools that are compatible with general nonlinear system dynamics,
and can formally deal with state and input constraints as well as bounded
disturbances. Our main contribution is the generalization of HJ reachability
framework to account for the discontinuous state changes originating from state
resets, which has remained a challenge until now. We apply our approach for
computing region-of-attractions for several underactuated walking robots and
demonstrate that the proposed approach can (a) recover a bigger
region-of-attraction than state-of-the-art approaches, (b) handle state resets,
nonlinear dynamics, external disturbances, and input constraints, and (c) also
provides a stabilizing controller for the system that can leverage the state

introduce logistical complications and security risks in deploying the anchor

via creating an underwater temporary isotropic acoustic transmitter with the
optoacoustic process. We analyze the process of controlling the shape and size

validate the generation of isotropic acoustic signals. Then two methods of

self-supervised learning, in this study, we attempt to enhance the
representation power of hyperbolic graph models by drawing upon the advantages
of contrastive learning. More specifically, we put forward a novel Hyperbolic
Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL) framework which learns node representations
through multiple hyperbolic spaces to implicitly capture the hierarchical
structure shared between different views. Then, we design a hyperbolic position
consistency (HPC) constraint based on hyperbolic distance and the homophily
assumption to make contrastive learning fit into hyperbolic space. Experimental
results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed HGCL as it consistently outperforms competing methods by considerable
margins for the node classification task.

standard toolkits, such as TextAttack and OpenAttack. In response, there is a
growing body of work on robust learning, which reduces vulnerability to these
attacks, though sometimes at a high cost in compute time or accuracy. In this
paper, we take an alternate approach -- we attempt to understand the attacker
by analyzing adversarial text to determine which methods were used to create
it. Our first contribution is an extensive dataset for attack detection and
labeling: 1.5~million attack instances, generated by twelve adversarial attacks
targeting three classifiers trained on six source datasets for sentiment
analysis and abuse detection in English. As our second contribution, we use
this dataset to develop and benchmark a number of classifiers for attack
identification -- determining if a given text has been adversarially
manipulated and by which attack. As a third contribution, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of three classes of features for these tasks: text properties,
capturing content and presentation of text; language model properties,
determining which tokens are more or less probable throughout the input; and
target model properties, representing how the text classifier is influenced by
the attack, including internal node activations. Overall, this represents a
first step towards forensics for adversarial attacks against text classifiers.

  Learning: A Graph Information Bottleneck Perspective",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have revealed that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
Most existing robust graph learning methods measure model robustness based on
label information, rendering them infeasible when label information is not
available. A straightforward direction is to employ the widely used Infomax
technique from typical Unsupervised Graph Representation Learning (UGRL) to
learn robust unsupervised representations. Nonetheless, directly transplanting
the Infomax technique from typical UGRL to robust UGRL may involve a biased
assumption. In light of the limitation of Infomax, we propose a novel unbiased
robust UGRL method called Robust Graph Information Bottleneck (RGIB), which is
grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. Our RGIB attempts to
learn robust node representations against adversarial perturbations by
preserving the original information in the benign graph while eliminating the
adversarial information in the adversarial graph. There are mainly two
challenges to optimize RGIB: 1) high complexity of adversarial attack to
perturb node features and graph structure jointly in the training procedure; 2)
mutual information estimation upon adversarially attacked graphs. To tackle
these problems, we further propose an efficient adversarial training strategy
with only feature perturbations and an effective mutual information estimator
with subgraph-level summary. Moreover, we theoretically establish a connection
between our proposed RGIB and the robustness of downstream classifiers,
revealing that RGIB can provide a lower bound on the adversarial risk of
downstream classifiers. Extensive experiments over several benchmarks and
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed
method.

electric vehicle with in-wheel motors is a good platform for implementing
advanced vehicle dynamics control. Among many active safety functions of an
in-wheel motor driven vehicle (IMDV), lateral stability control is a key
technology, which can be realized through torque vectoring. To further advance
the lateral stabilization performance of the IMDV, in this paper a novel
data-driven nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is proposed based the
recurrent high-order neural network (RHONN) modelling method. First, the new
RHONN model is developed to represent vehicle's nonlinear dynamic behaviors.
Different from the conventional physics-based modelling method, the RHONN model
only needs data and forms high-order polynomials. Based on the RHONN model, the
steady-state responses of vehicle's yaw rate and sideslip angle are iteratively
optimized and set as the control objectives for low-level controller, aiming to
improve the system robustness. Besides, a nonlinear model predictive controller
is designed based on the RHONN, which is expected to improve the prediction
accuracy during the receding horizon control. Further, a constrained
optimization problem is formulated to derive the required yaw moment for
vehicle lateral dynamics stabilization. Finally, the performance of the
developed RHONN-based nonlinear MPC is validated on an IMDV in the
CarSim/Simulink simulation environment. The validation results show that the
developed approach outperforms the conventional method, and further improves
the stable margin of the system. It is able to enhance the lateral
stabilization performance of the IMDV under various driving scenarios,
demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

making it robust to small perturbations in the nuisance parameters.
Furthermore, by establishing connections with the representation learning
approaches, we create a framework from which multiple variants of our algorithm

with inhomogeneous turbulence. The particle Hamiltonian is kept general; for
example, relativistic, electromagnetic, and gravitational effects are subsumed.
A Fokker--Planck equation for the dressed 'oscillation-center' distribution is
derived from the Klimontovich equation and captures quasilinear diffusion,
interaction with the background fields, and ponderomotive effects
simultaneously. The local diffusion coefficient is manifestly
positive-semidefinite. Waves are allowed to be off-shell (i.e. not constrained
by a dispersion relation), and a collision integral of the Balescu--Lenard type
emerges in a form that is not restricted to any particular Hamiltonian. This
operator conserves particles, momentum, and energy, and it also satisfies the
H-theorem, as usual. As a spin-off, a general expression for the spectrum of
microscopic fluctuations is derived. For on-shell waves, which satisfy a
quasilinear wave-kinetic equation, the theory conserves the momentum and energy
of the wave--plasma system. The action of nonresonant waves is also conserved,
unlike in the standard version of QLT. Dewar's oscillation-center QLT of
electrostatic turbulence (1973, Phys. Fluids 16, 1102) is proven formally as a
particular case and given a concise formulation. Also discussed as examples are
relativistic electromagnetic and gravitational interactions, and QLT for
gravitational waves is proposed.

that generates audio descriptions corresponding to the slide content. This
problem poses as an image-to-markup language generation task. The initial step
is to extract logical regions such as title, text, equation, figure, and table
from the slide image. In the classroom slide images, the logical regions are
distributed based on the location of the image. To utilize the location of the
logical regions for slide image segmentation, we propose the architecture,
Classroom Slide Segmentation Network (CSSN). The unique attributes of this
architecture differs from most other semantic segmentation networks. Publicly
available benchmark datasets such as WiSe and SPaSe are used to validate the
performance of our segmentation architecture. We obtained 9.54 segmentation
accuracy improvement in WiSe dataset. We extract content (information) from the
slide using four well-established modules such as optical character recognition
(OCR), figure classification, equation description, and table structure
recognizer. With this information, we build a Classroom Slide Narration System
(CSNS) to help VI students understand the slide content. The users have given
better feedback on the quality output of the proposed CSNS in comparison to
existing systems like Facebooks Automatic Alt-Text (AAT) and Tesseract.

atomic mass dependence is incorporated. The quark transport coefficient is
determined as a function of the atomic mass, Bjorken variable $x_2$ and scale

which galaxies form from the inner and lower sAM portion of their parent halos,
has a minor effect at low redshifts. The retention factor of angular momentum

include the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), Fourier basis functions, and
their combinations. The unsupervised machine learning method, e.g., the K-SVD

representation performance than the EOFs. However, existing methods do not
consider basis function learning approaches that treat 3D SSF data as a
third-order tensor, and thus cannot fully utilize the 3D
interactions/correlations therein. To circumvent such a drawback, basis
function learning is linked to tensor decomposition in this paper, which is the
primary drive for recent multi-dimensional data mining. In particular, a
tensor-based basis function learning framework is proposed, which can include
the classical basis functions (using EOFs and/or Fourier basis functions) as
its special cases. This provides a unified tensor perspective for understanding
and representing 3D SSFs. Numerical results using the South China Sea 3D SSF

role in a complete description of symmetry-breaking phases. In this paper, we
develop the theory of symmetry defects in fractonic superfluids, i.e.,
spontaneously higher-rank symmetry (HRS) breaking phases. By Noether's theorem,
HRS is associated with the conservation law of higher moments, e.g. dipoles,
quadrupoles, and angular moments. We establish finite-temperature phase
diagrams by identifying a series of topological phase transitions via the
renormalization group flow equations and Debye-H\""uckel approximation.
Accordingly, a series of Kosterlitz-Thouless topological transitions are found
to occur successively at different temperatures, which are triggered by
proliferation of defects, defect bound states, and so on. Such a
\emph{hierarchical proliferation} brings rich phase structures. Meanwhile, a
screening effect from sufficiently high density of defect bound states leads to
instability and collapse of the intermediate temperature phases, which further
enriches the phase diagrams. For concreteness, we consider a fractonic
superfluid in which ``angular moments'' are conserved. We then present the
general theory, in which other types of HRS can be analyzed in a similar
manner. Further directions are present at the end of the paper.

managing the space-air-sea (SAS) NTN resources, i.e., energy, power, and

energy-efficient resource allocation is investigated in this study. The goal is
to maximize system energy efficiency (EE) by collaboratively optimizing user
equipment (UE) association, power control, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
deployment. Given the limited payloads of UAVs, this work focuses on minimizing
the total energy cost of UAVs (trajectory and transmission) while meeting EE
requirements. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is proposed,
followed by the development of an algorithm to decompose, and solve each
problem distributedly. The binary (UE association) and continuous (power,
deployment) variables are separated using the Bender decomposition (BD), and
then the Dinkelbach algorithm (DA) is used to convert fractional programming
into an equivalent solvable form in the subproblem. A standard optimization
solver is utilized to deal with the complexity of the master problem for binary
variables. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is
used to solve the subproblem for the continuous variables. Our proposed
algorithm provides a suboptimal solution, and simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm achieves better EE than baselines.

fractal basin boundaries at a fixed resolution. Here, we extend this criterion
into a new test with improved sensitivity that we call the \textit{$S_{bb}$

candidate that could help to cope with the ever-increasing demand for archival
storage requirements. It involves designing molecules of distinct masses to
represent the respective bits $\{0,1\}$, followed by the synthesis of a polymer
of molecular units that reflects the order of bits in the information string.
Reading out the stored data requires the use of a tandem mass spectrometer,
that fragments the polymer into shorter substrings and provides their
corresponding masses, from which the \emph{composition}, i.e. the number of
$1$s and $0$s in the concerned substring can be inferred. Prior works have
dealt with the problem of unique string reconstruction from the set of all
possible compositions, called \emph{composition multiset}. This was
accomplished either by determining which string lengths always allow unique
reconstruction, or by formulating coding constraints to facilitate the same for
all string lengths. Additionally, error-correcting schemes to deal with
substitution errors caused by imprecise fragmentation during the readout
process, have also been suggested. This work builds on this research by
generalizing previously considered error models, mainly confined to
substitution of compositions. To this end, we define new error models that
consider insertions of spurious compositions and deletions of existing ones,
thereby corrupting the composition multiset. We analyze if the reconstruction

data. Among these SSL approaches, pseudo-labeling (PL) is one of the most
popular. PL approaches apply pseudo-labels to unlabeled data, and then train
the model with a combination of the labeled and pseudo-labeled data
iteratively. The key to the success of PL is the selection of high-quality
pseudo-labeled samples. Previous works mostly select training samples by
manually setting a single confidence threshold. We propose to automatically
select reliable pseudo-labeled samples with a series of dynamic thresholds,
which constitutes a learning curriculum. Extensive experiments on six keypoint
localization benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach
significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art SSL approaches.

introducing consumer fairness is a key problem, widely studied in both academia
and industry. Current research has led to a variety of notions, metrics, and
unfairness mitigation procedures. The evaluation of each procedure has been
heterogeneous and limited to a mere comparison with models not accounting for
fairness. It is hence hard to contextualize the impact of each mitigation
procedure w.r.t. the others. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis of
mitigation procedures against consumer unfairness in rating prediction and
top-n recommendation tasks. To this end, we collected 15 procedures proposed in
recent top-tier conferences and journals. Only 8 of them could be reproduced.
Under a common evaluation protocol, based on two public data sets, we then
studied the extent to which recommendation utility and consumer fairness are
impacted by these procedures, the interplay between two primary fairness
notions based on equity and independence, and the demographic groups harmed by
the disparate impact. Our study finally highlights open challenges and future
directions in this field. The source code is available at

the condensation of solar nebula gas. Enstatite chondrites, one of the most
important repositories of oldhamite, are believed to be the representative of
the material which formed Earth. Thus, the formation mechanism and the
evolution process of oldhamite are of great significance to the deeply
understanding about the solar nebula, meteorites, the origin of Earth, and the
C-O-S-Ca cycles of Earth. To date, no report about the oldhamite in the mantle
exists. However, here we show the formation of oldhamite through the reaction
between sulfide-bearing orthopyroxenite and molten CaCO3 at 1.5 GPa/1510 K and
0.5 GPa/1320 K. Surprisingly the oxygen fugacities in our experiments are
within the range of mantle conditions, which is at least 6 orders of magnitude
higher than that of the solar nebula mechanism. Oldhamite is easily oxidized to
CaSO4. Low oxygen fugacity of magma and extreme low oxygen content of
atmosphere are necessary for existence of oldhamite on the surface of a planet;
otherwise, anhydrite or gypsum will exist in large quantities. The widespread
existence of oldhamite on the planet's surface indicates the planet is
definitely not habitable. The formation and oxidation of oldhamite are
accompanied by the production of CO2 and the consumption of O2, which may have
impact on the ecosystem of planets.

can be directly invited to the sale by the seller. Our goal is to design an
auction to incentivize the buyers who are aware of the auction to further
invite their neighbors to join the auction. This is challenging because the
buyers are competing for the items and they would not invite each other by
default. Thus, rewards need to be given to buyers who diffuse information, but
the rewards should be carefully designed to guarantee both invitation
incentives and the seller's revenue. Solutions have been proposed recently for
the settings where each buyer requires at most one unit and demonstrated the
difficulties of the design. We move this forward to propose the very first

  Detectors in the Physical World",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to recent backdoor
attacks. A backdoored model behaves normally for inputs containing no
attacker-secretly-chosen trigger and maliciously for inputs with the trigger.
To date, backdoor attacks and countermeasures mainly focus on image
classification tasks. And most of them are implemented in the digital world
with digital triggers. Besides the classification tasks, object detection
systems are also considered as one of the basic foundations of computer vision
tasks. However, there is no investigation and understanding of the backdoor
vulnerability of the object detector, even in the digital world with digital
triggers. For the first time, this work demonstrates that existing object
detectors are inherently susceptible to physical backdoor attacks. We use a
natural T-shirt bought from a market as a trigger to enable the cloaking
effect--the person bounding-box disappears in front of the object detector. We
show that such a backdoor can be implanted from two exploitable attack
scenarios into the object detector, which is outsourced or fine-tuned through a
pretrained model. We have extensively evaluated three popular object detection
algorithms: anchor-based Yolo-V3, Yolo-V4, and anchor-free CenterNet. Building
upon 19 videos shot in real-world scenes, we confirm that the backdoor attack
is robust against various factors: movement, distance, angle, non-rigid
deformation, and lighting. Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) in most
videos is 100% or close to it, while the clean data accuracy of the backdoored
model is the same as its clean counterpart. The latter implies that it is
infeasible to detect the backdoor behavior merely through a validation set. The
averaged ASR still remains sufficiently high to be 78% in the transfer learning
attack scenarios evaluated on CenterNet. See the demo video on

Differentiating characteristics of quality requirements compared to other types

sequences (MSs) below the knee are either broadened or split thus providing
evidence of MPs among VLM stars. In contrast, the MS of NGC 6791 is consistent
with a single population. The color distribution of M-dwarfs dramatically
changes between different GCs and the color width correlates with the cluster
mass. We conclude that the MP ubiquity, variety, and dependence on GC mass are
properties common to VLM and more-massive stars. We combined UV, optical, and
NIR observations of NGC 2808 and NGC 6121 (M 4) to identify MPs along with a
wide range of stellar masses (~ 0.2 - 0.8M ), from the MS turn off to the VLM
regime, and measured, for the first time, their mass functions (MFs). We find
that the fraction of MPs does not depend on the stellar mass and that their MFs
have similar slopes. These findings indicate that the properties of MPs do not
depend on stellar mass. In a scenario where the second generations formed in
higher-density environments than the first generations, the possibility that
the MPs formed with the same initial MF would suggest that it does not depend

to a lack of dense ground truth data. To detect such errors during usage, we
extend the cost volume based Deep Video to Depth (DeepV2D) framework

Our experiments show that a simple filter strategy based on the uncertainty can
significantly reduce systematic errors. This results in cleaner reconstructions

maps which provides visual explanations for deep neural networks (DNNs). The
saliency maps are conventionally generated by fusing the channels of the target
feature map using a weighted average scheme. It is a weak model for the
inter-channel relation, in the sense that it only models the relation among
channels in a contrastive way (i.e., channels that play key roles in the
prediction are given higher weights for them to stand out in the fusion). The
collaborative relation, which makes the channels work together to provide cross
reference, has been ignored. Furthermore, the model has neglected the
intra-channel relation thoroughly.In this paper, we address this problem by
introducing Conceptor learning into CAM generation. Conceptor leaning has been
originally proposed to model the patterns of state changes in recurrent neural
networks (RNNs). By relaxing the dependency of Conceptor learning to RNNs, we
make Conceptor-CAM not only generalizable to more DNN architectures but also
able to learn both the inter- and intra-channel relations for better saliency
map generation. Moreover, we have enabled the use of Boolean operations to
combine the positive and pseudo-negative evidences, which has made the CAM
inference more robust and comprehensive. The effectiveness of Conceptor-CAM has
been validated with both formal verifications and experiments on the dataset of
the largest scale in literature. The experimental results show that
Conceptor-CAM is compatible with and can bring significant improvement to all
well recognized CAM-based methods, and has outperformed the state-of-the-art

loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the Universe. Detection rates
for ground or space-based detectors based on cosmological simulations and
semi-analytic models are highly uncertain. A major difficulty stems from the
necessity to model the BHB from the scale of the merger to that of inspiral. Of
particular relevance to the GW merger timescale is the binary eccentricity.
Here we present a self-consistent numerical study of the eccentricity of BHBs
formed in massive gas-free mergers from the early stages of the merger to the
hardening phase, followed by a semi-analytical model down to coalescence. We
find that the early eccentricity of the unbound black hole pair is largely
determined by the initial orbit. It systematically decreases during the
dynamical friction phase. The eccentricity at binary formation is affected by
stochasticity and noise owing to encounters with stars, but preserves a strong
correlation with the initial orbital eccentricity. Binding of the black holes
is a phase characterised by strong perturbations, and we present a quantitative
definition of the time of binary formation. During hardening the eccentricity
increases in minor mergers, unless the binary is approximately circular, but
remains largely unchanged in major mergers, in agreement with predictions from
semi-analytical models based on isotropic scattering experiments. Coalescence
times due to hardening and GW emission in gas-poor non-rotating ellipticals are

obtain a finite-dimensional linear system, and use it for moment approximation
by iteratively propagating the moments along the finite-dimensional linear
dynamics across time. We provide efficient online computation methods for this

also shows that precise values of certain moments can be obtained when the

learners known as artificial neural networks (ANN) have shown great successes

Small learning rate, stochastic gradient descent algorithm and large training

neural networks. Yet few ANN learners have been developed and studied to find
needles in nonlinear haystacks. Driven by a single hyperparameter, our ANN
learner, like for sparse linear associations, exhibits a phase transition in
the probability of retrieving the needles, which we do not observe with other
ANN learners. To select our penalty parameter, we generalize the universal
threshold of Donoho and Johnstone (1994) which is a better rule than the

ubiquitous from quantum to macro scale. The Onsager theorem is often used to

symmetric. Here we show that this matrix is intrinsically diagonal when the

an important research topic for computer-aided diagnosis and surgery. Most
existing methods require a fully labeled dataset in each source domain.
Although some researchers developed a semi-supervised domain generalized
method, it still requires the domain labels. This paper presents a novel
confidence-aware cross pseudo supervision algorithm for semi-supervised domain
generalized medical image segmentation. The main goal is to enhance the pseudo
label quality for unlabeled images from unknown distributions. To achieve it,
we perform the Fourier transformation to learn low-level statistic information
across domains and augment the images to incorporate cross-domain information.
With these augmentations as perturbations, we feed the input to a
confidence-aware cross pseudo supervision network to measure the variance of
pseudo labels and regularize the network to learn with more confident pseudo
labels. Our method sets new records on public datasets, i.e., M&Ms and SCGM.
Notably, without using domain labels, our method surpasses the prior art that
even uses domain labels by 11.67% on Dice on M&Ms dataset with 2% labeled data.

Therefore, it is pivotal to have a precise evaluation method to gauge the

several evaluation metrics have been proposed in the past (such as Energy
Score, Dawid-Sebastiani score, variogram score), however, they cannot reliably
measure the performance of a probabilistic forecaster. Recently, CRPS-sum has
gained a lot of prominence as a reliable metric for multivariate probabilistic

conduct few-shot classification experiments using softmax-based and DR

In this work, SMR is used to probe paramagnetic NdGaO3 (NGO), a rare earth
oxide, possessing a sizable spin orbit interaction (L=6). NGO has not been
investigated earlier for its efficiency in propagating spins. We have performed
extensive temperature and angle dependent-magnetoresistance (ADMR) studies
along dissimilar crystallographic axes in NGO, using platinum (Pt) as spin
injector and detector and utilizing (inverse) spin Hall effect. We find a close
correlation between the temperature dependence of the ADMR response with
magnetization in NGO and a linear current bias dependence of the ADMR
amplitudes. These are chacteristics of SMR effect in Pt/NGO, arising from the
torque acting on localized moments in NGO and considering crystal field induced
intermultiplet transitions with temperature. Control experiments on Pt/SrTiO3
and Pt/SiO2 devices were also carried out in order to validate the observed SMR

to multitime processes. The fluctuation theorems for quantum channels are less
restrictive. We show that the given entropy production can be equal to the
result of a closed system environment. The assumption that the system evolves
under a completely positive and trace preserving map is quite general, but it
is more specific for cases in which the system is initially correlated with the
environment. System-environment correlations arise naturally in multitime
processes, with which we can give clear and physical interpretations regarding
the effects of correlations. Multitime processes can provide many-body
channels. The Choi state of such a many-body channel is called a process
tensor. One can derive channels by executing the process tensor on a set of
operations. We establish a general quantum fluctuation theorem framework for a
many-body channel and its derived channels. In this framework, the effects of
correlations are reflected in a Markovian property. For Markovian processes, we
can extend the two-point measurement to a three-point measurement and obtain
that the fluctuation theorems contain complete information about the
intermediate state. For non-Markovian processes, the complete measurement of
the intermediate state leads to conflicts. Therefore, we use a general
measurement, which only provides partial information, for the intermediate
state. The corresponding fluctuation theorems show that memory effects can
reduce these fluctuations. This is consistent with the fact that system states
can be recovered under non-Markovian processes.

entanglement since it corresponds to those states that are not biseparable,
i.e.\ a mixture of partially separable states across different bipartitions of

where many perfect copies of a given state can be produced and controlled. In
this scenario the above definition leads to subtle intricacies as biseparable
states can be GME-activatable, i.e.\ several copies of a biseparable state can
display GME. We show that the set of GME-activatable states admits a simple
characterization: a state is GME-activatable if and only if it is not partially
separable across one bipartition of the parties. This leads to the second
question of whether there is a general upper bound in the number of copies that
needs to be considered in order to observe the activation of GME, which we
answer in the negative. In particular, by providing an explicit construction,
we prove that for any number of parties and any number $k\in\mathbb{N}$ there
exist GME-activatable multipartite states of fixed (i.e.\ independent of $k$)

is the predominant element. In addition, it is not clear whether some hybrid
carbon (C) oxygen (O)-Ne white dwarfs might form when convective boundary
mixing is accounted for during the propagation of the C-flame, in the C-burning
stage. Both Ne-dominated and hybrid CO-Ne core would have measurable
consequences for asteroseismological studies based on evolutionary models. In
this work we explore in detail to which extent differences in the adopted
micro- and macro-physics can explain the different final white dwarf
compositions that have been found by different authors. Additionally, we
explored the impact of such differences in the cooling times, crystallization
and pulsational properties of pulsating WDs. We explore the impact of the
intensity of convective boundary mixing during the C-flash, extreme mass-loss
rates, and the size of the adopted nuclear networks on the final composition,
age, crystallization and pulsational properties of white dwarfs. Based on the
insight coming from 3D hydro-dynamical simulations, we expect that the very
slow propagation of the carbon flame will be altered by turbulent entrainment
affecting the inward propagation of the flame. Also, we find that Ne-dominated
chemical profiles of massive WDs recently reported appear in their modeling due
to the overlooking of a key nuclear reaction. We find that the inaccuracies in
the chemical composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs recently reported lead
to differences of 10% in the cooling times and degree of crystallization and
about 8% in the period spacing of the models once they reach the ZZ Ceti

ring of varieties to the setting of the character stacks. To this aim, we
define a suitable Grothendieck ring of representable stacks, over which this

action.
  We apply this framework in two cases providing explicit expressions for the
virtual classes of the character stacks of closed orientable surfaces of
arbitrary genus. First, in the case of the affine linear group of rank $1$, the
virtual class of the character stack fully remembers the natural adjoint

straightforwardly derived. Second, we consider the non-connected group
$\mathbb{G}_m \rtimes \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, and we show how our theory

fragmentation of blockchain networks and scalability solutions such as
side-chaining and sharding. With SmartSync, we propose a novel concept for
cross-blockchain smart contract interactions that creates client contracts on
arbitrary blockchain networks supporting the same execution environment. Client
contracts mirror the logic and state of the original instance and enable
seamless on-chain function executions providing recent states. Synchronized
contracts supply instant read-only function calls to other applications hosted
on the target blockchain. Hereby, current limitations in cross-chain
communication are alleviated and new forms of contract interactions are
enabled. State updates are transmitted in a verifiable manner using Merkle
proofs and do not require trusted intermediaries. To permit lightweight
synchronizations, we introduce transition confirmations that facilitate the
application of verifiable state transitions without re-executing transactions
of the source blockchain. We prove the concept's soundness by providing a
prototypical implementation that enables smart contract forks, state
synchronizations, and on-chain validation on EVM-compatible blockchains. Our
evaluation demonstrates SmartSync's applicability for presented use cases
providing access to recent states to third-party contracts on the target
blockchain. Execution costs scale sub-linearly with the number of value updates
and depend on the depth and index of corresponding Merkle proofs.

estimation uses (semi-)manually labelled marker locations in projection data to
fit the parameters of a polynomial deformation model. Manually-labelled marker
locations are difficult to obtain when data are noisy or markers overlap in
projection data. We propose an alternative mathematical approach for
simultaneous marker localization and deformation estimation by extending a
grid-free super-resolution algorithm first proposed in the context of
single-molecule localization microscopy. Our approach does not require labelled
marker locations; instead, we use an image-based loss where we compare the
forward projection of markers with the observed data. We equip this marker
localization scheme with an additional deformation estimation component and
solve for a reduced number of deformation parameters. Using extensive numerical
studies on marker-only samples, we show that our approach automatically finds
markers and reliably estimates sample deformation without labelled marker data.
We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach for a broad range of
model mismatch scenarios, including experimental electron tomography data of
gold markers on ice.

The contact

states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous
infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list
of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the
absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the
critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\beta=1$, $\gamma'=0$, and
$\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct
finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of
the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and
the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \to \infty$ yields
the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected.
Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic
reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.

M105. We present a catalogue of 314 PNe and firmly associate 93 with NGC 3384

surrounding exponential envelope. We construct smooth velocity and velocity
dispersion fields and calculate projected rotation, velocity dispersion, and
$\lambda_R$ profiles for each component. Halo PNe exhibit declining velocity
dispersion and rotation profiles, while the velocity dispersion and rotation of
the exponential envelope increase notably at large radii. We identify three
regimes with distinct kinematics that are linked to distinct stellar population
properties: (i) the rotating core (within $1~R_\mathrm{eff}$) formed in situ
and dominated by metal-rich ([M/H]~0) stars likely formed in situ, (ii) the
halo from 1 to $7.5~R_\mathrm{eff}$ consisting of intermediate-metallicity
stars ([M/H]>-1), either formed in situ or brought in through major mergers,
and (iii) the exponential envelope reaching beyond our farthest data point at
16 $R_\mathrm{eff}$, predominately composed of metal-poor ([M/H]<-1) stars. The
high velocity dispersion and moderate rotation of the latter are consistent
with that measured for dwarf satellite galaxies in the Leo I group, indicating
that the exponential envelope traces the transition to the IGL.

random feature approximations for dot product kernels, to make these kernels
more useful in large scale learning. First, we present a generalization of
existing random feature approximations for polynomial kernels, such as

significantly reduce the variances of these approximations. Second, we provide

certain approximations (e.g., TensorSRHT) achieve lower variances than others
(e.g., Rademacher sketches), and conditions under which the use of complex
features leads to lower variances than real features. Third, by using these
variance formulas, which can be evaluated in practice, we develop a data-driven
optimization approach to improve random feature approximations for general dot
product kernels, which is also applicable to the Gaussian kernel. We describe
the improvements brought by these contributions with extensive experiments on a

Previous research found that almost half of the population in developed

the gradual shift toward the shared decision making (SDM) process and digital
transformation in oncology, the need for dealing with low HL issues is more
crucial. Decision making in oncology is often accompanied by considerable
consequences on patients lives, which requires patients to understand complex

values. How health information is perceived by patients is influenced by
various factors including patients characteristics and the way information is

clinicians in dealing with LHL. Furthermore, preparing reliable sources of

to a change in the way energy is generated and billed. This shift cannot be
managed without a unified view of energy systems and their components. This
unified view is captured within the idea of a Smart Local Energy System (SLES).
Currently, various isolated control and market elements are proposed to resolve
network constraints, demand side response and utility optimisation. They rely
on topology estimations, forecasting and fault detection methods to complete
their tasks. This disjointed design has led to most systems being capable of
fulfilling only a single role or being resistant to change and extensions in
functionality. By allocating roles, functional responsibilities and technical
requirements to bounded systems a more unified view of energy systems can be
achieved. This is made possible by representing an energy system as a
distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) environment where each individual demand energy
resource (DER) on the consumer's side of the meter is responsible for their
portion of the network and can facilitate trade with numerous entities
including the grid. Advances in control engineering, markets and services such
as forecasting, topology identification and cyber-security can enable such
trading and communication to be done securely and robustly. To enable this
advantage however, we need to redefine how we view the design of the
sub-systems and interconnections within smart local energy systems (SLES). In
this paper we describe a way in which whole system design could be achieved by
integrating control, markets and analytics into each system. We propose the use
of physical, control, market and service layers to create system of systems
representation.

results page (SERP) to help searchers decide which result to click. This raises
questions about when such summaries are sufficient for relevance estimation by
the ranking model or the human assessor, and whether humans and machines
benefit from the document's full text in similar ways. To answer these
questions, we study human and neural model based relevance assessments on 12k
query-documents sampled from Bing's search logs. We compare changes in the
relevance assessments when only the document summaries and when the full text
is also exposed to assessors, studying a range of query and document
properties, e.g., query type, snippet length. Our findings show that the full
text is beneficial for humans and a BERT model for similar query and document

their full quantitative characterization in a reflection configuration is
challenging due to complex wave patterns arising from the interference between
several excitation channels. Here, we present near-field measurements of SPPs
on large monocrystalline gold platelets in the visible spectral range. We study
systematically the influence of the incident angle of the exciting light on the
SPPs launched by an atomic force microscope tip. We find that the amplitude and
phase signals of these SPPs are best disentangled from other signals at grazing
incident angle relative to the edge of the gold platelet. Furthermore, we
introduce a simple model to explain the phase shift observed between the SPP
amplitude and phase profiles. Using this model, the wavelength and propagation
length of the tip-launched plasmons are retrieved by isolating and fitting
their signals far from the platelets edges. Our experimental results are in
excellent agreement with theoretical models using gold refractive index values.
The presented method to fully characterize the SPP complex wavevector could
enable the quantitative analysis of polaritons occurring in different materials

quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT) that is capable of
describing these strongly coupled systems from first-principles. To investigate
response properties of relatively large systems coupled to a wide range of

features of strong light-matter coupling both in the dispersion and absorption

exemplify the efficiency of the Sternheimer approach by coupling the matter

investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the three-dimensional
homogeneous electron gas at very low density. Fermi fluid and body-centered
cubic Wigner crystal ground state energies are determined using
Slater-Jastrow-backflow and Slater-Jastrow many-body wave functions at
different densities and spin polarizations in finite simulation cells.
Finite-size errors are removed using twist-averaged boundary conditions and
extrapolation of the energy per particle to the thermodynamic limit of infinite
system size. Unlike previous studies, our results show that the electron gas
undergoes a first-order quantum phase transition directly from a paramagnetic
fluid to a body-centered cubic crystal at density parameter $r_\text{s} =
86.6(7)$, with no region of stability for an itinerant ferromagnetic fluid.
However there is a possible magnetic phase transition from an antiferromagnetic
crystal to a ferromagnetic crystal at $r_\text{s}=93(3)$.

  Success",,,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many studies in the field of education analytics have identified student
grade point averages (GPA) as an important indicator and predictor of students'
final academic outcomes (graduate or halt). And while semester-to-semester
fluctuations in GPA are considered normal, significant changes in academic
performance may warrant more thorough investigation and consideration,
particularly with regards to final academic outcomes. However, such an approach
is challenging due to the difficulties of representing complex academic
trajectories over an academic career. In this study, we apply a Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) to provide a standard and intuitive classification over students'
academic-performance levels, which leads to a compact representation of
academic-performance trajectories. Next, we explore the relationship between
different academic-performance trajectories and their correspondence to final
academic success. Based on student transcript data from University of Central
Florida, our proposed HMM is trained using sequences of students' course grades
for each semester. Through the HMM, our analysis follows the expected finding
that higher academic performance levels correlate with lower halt rates.
However, in this paper, we identify that there exist many scenarios in which
both improving or worsening academic-performance trajectories actually
correlate to higher graduation rates. This counter-intuitive finding is made
possible through the proposed and developed HMM model.

piezoelectric plate submerged near the free surface and exposed to incident
head gravity waves and current. An inviscid theoretical vortex model is
employed to describe the hydrodynamic interactions between a flexible body, its
wake, gravity waves and the incident current. The model reveals two distinct
vibration states of a piezoelectric device that correspond to almost similar
optimal energy production levels. The first is associated with the cantilever
fluttering mode of the plate with limited dependency on the plate's flexibility
across different Froude numbers and incoming wave frequencies. The other is the
flow-induced flapping mode in more flexible plates, wherein much higher
dependency on the plate flexibility is observed. The concurrent existence of
these two energetic modes allows adjustment of the plate length to consistently
achieve the maximum energy production level across different flow conditions.
The role of the Froude number of the system's responses is explored and
correlated to the appearance of gravity wave groups on the surface, each
propagating with a different wavenumber. It is shown that the submergence depth
of less than half of the body length is required to reach a high energetic
condition in subcritical and critical flows, with Froude number less than or
equal to one. Finally, the role of electrical parameters are quantified and the
optimal inductive and resistive values are related to proper matching between

spins with nearest-neighbour interactions and we randomly replace a fixed

linear spin-wave regime and address the propagation of a spin-wave excitation
with initial momentum $k_0$. We compute the disorder-averaged momentum
distribution obtained at time $t$ and show that the system exhibits two
regimes. At low defect density, typical disorder configurations only involve a
single percolating magnetic cluster interspersed with single defects
essentially and the physics is driven by Anderson localization. In this case,
the momentum distribution features the emergence of two known emblematic
signatures of coherent transport, namely the coherent backscattering (CBS) peak
located at $-k_0$ and the coherent forward scattering (CFS) peak located at
$k_0$. At long times, the momentum distribution becomes stationary. However,
when increasing the defect density, site percolation starts to set in and
typical disorder configurations display more and more disconnected clusters of
different sizes and shapes. At the same time, the CFS peak starts to oscillate
in time with well defined frequencies. These oscillation frequencies represent
eigenenergy differences in the regular, disorder-immune, part of the
Hamiltonian spectrum. This regular spectrum originates from the small-size
magnetic clusters and its weight grows as the system undergoes site percolation
and small clusters proliferate. Our system offers a unique spectroscopic
signature of cluster formation in site percolation problems.

natural Ramsey-type question, generalizing some well-studied zero-sum problems

Garg, Mehlhorn, Mehta, and Misra, who proved that $d \leq R_f(d) \leq d^4+d$

risk of large outbreaks in dense course settings is contrasted by the benefits

as vaccination coverage and efficacy, number of contacts and adoption of
non-pharmaceutical intervention measures (NPIs). Due to the generalised
academic freedom in Europe, many universities are asked to autonomously decide
on and implement intervention measures and regulate on-campus operations. In
the context of rapidly changing vaccination coverage and parameters of the
virus, universities often lack sufficient scientific insight to base these
decisions on. To address this problem, we analyse a calibrated, data-driven
agent-based simulation of transmission dynamics of 10755 students and 974

network reconstructed from student enrollment data and calibrate transmission
risk based on outbreak size distributions in education institutions. We focus
on actionable interventions that are part of the already existing
decision-making process of universities to provide guidance for concrete policy
decisions. Here we show that, with the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
even a reduction to 25% occupancy and universal mask mandates are not enough to
prevent large outbreaks given the vaccination coverage of about 80% recently

optical lattices suffers from dipole-dipole interaction induced shifts and
collective superradiance limiting its precision and accuracy. We propose a
novel geometry implementing fast signal readout with minimal heating for large
atom numbers at lower densities via an optical cavity operated in the weak
single atom but strong collective coupling regime. The key idea is controlled
collective transverse $\pi/2$-excitation of the atoms to prepare a macroscopic
collective spin protected from cavity superradiance. This requires that the two
halves of the atomic ensemble are coupled to the cavity mode with opposite
phase, which is naturally realized for a homogeneously filled volume covering
odd and even sites of the cavity mode along the cavity axis. The origin of the
superior precision can be traced back to destructive interference among
sub-ensembles in the complex nonlinear collective atom field dynamics. In the
same configuration we find surprising regular self-pulsing of the cavity output
for suitable continuous illumination. Our simulations for large atom numbers
employing a cumulant expansion are qualitatively confirmed by a full quantum

paradigms of algebra, symbolic calculus and logic. In particular, we delve into

new notions of associativity (or lack thereof) in ternary operations of cubic
matrices, ternary isomorphisms and ternary relations, the integration problem
of 3-Lie algebras, and generalizations of adjacency in 3-uniform hypergraphs.

ternary mathematics. Finally, we comment on potential future research

data like air quality in cities. However, to obtain a dense spatial coverage, a
large number of static monitors are required, thereby making it a costly
option. Dense spatiotemporal coverage can be achieved using only a fraction of
static sensors by deploying them on the moving vehicles, known as the drive by
sensing paradigm. The redundancy present in the air quality data can be
exploited by processing the sparsely sampled data to impute the remaining
unobserved data points using the matrix completion techniques. However, the
accuracy of imputation is dependent on the extent to which the moving sensors
capture the inherent structure of the air quality matrix. Therefore, the
challenge is to pick those set of paths (using vehicles) that perform
representative sampling in space and time. Most works in the literature for
vehicle subset selection focus on maximizing the spatiotemporal coverage by
maximizing the number of samples for different locations and time stamps which
is not an effective representative sampling strategy. We present regressive
facility location-based drive by sensing, an efficient vehicle selection
framework that incorporates the smoothness in neighboring locations and
autoregressive time correlation while selecting the optimal set of vehicles for
effective spatiotemporal sampling. We show that the proposed drive by sensing
problem is submodular, thereby lending itself to a greedy algorithm but with
performance guarantees. We evaluate our framework on selecting a subset from
the fleet of public transport in Delhi, India. We illustrate that the proposed
method samples the representative spatiotemporal data against the baseline
methods, reducing the extrapolation error on the simulated air quality data.
Our method, therefore, has the potential to provide cost effective dense air
quality maps.

a Round Robin regression approach involving four independent multivariate
regression models including a linear model, Bayesian Ridge regression, as well

to optimize the application's execution time for multi-request offloading in a
heterogeneous edge-cloud computing system, which considers the impact of
processing multi-requests overlapping and dynamic vehicle speed. The proposed
genetic algorithm integrates an adaptive penalty function to assimilate the SLA
constraints regarding latency, processing time, deadline, CPU, and memory
requirements. Numerical experiments and analysis compare our QoS-SLA-AGA to
random offloading, and baseline genetic-based approaches. Results show
QoS-SLA-AGA executes the requests 1.22 times faster on average compared to the
random offloading approach and with 59.9% fewer SLA violations. In contrast,
the baseline genetic-based approach increases the requests' performance by 1.14
times, with 19.8% more SLA violations.

cosmological model in framework of the symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity
proposed by Jimenez et al. (Physical Review D 98.4 (2018): 044048), where the
non-metricity $Q$ is responsible for the gravitational interaction. For the
whole analysis we have considered a special form of $f\left(Q\right)$ gravity
function i.e. $f\left( Q\right) =\alpha Q^{n}+\beta $ (where $\alpha $, $\beta
$, and $n$ are the dynamical model constant parameters) in the direction of
$t\left( z\right) =\frac{kt_{0}}{b}f\left( z\right)$, where, $f\left( z\right)
=W\left[ \frac{b}{k}e^{\frac{b-\ln \left(1+z\right) }{k}}\right] $ and $W$
denotes the Lambert function. We have discussed two cases of the function:
linear $f(Q)$ model towards $ n=1$ and quadratic for $n=2$. In both the model
we had verified the validity of the models with the help of energy conditions
along with some physical parameters like equation of state parameter, jerk
parameter, statefinder parameters are also discussed in details and compared it
with the observational data.

crucial for the determination of robust treatment plans in radiation therapy.
This requires the solution of particle transport problems with uncertain
parameters or initial conditions. Monte Carlo methods are often used to solve
transport problems especially for applications which require high accuracy. In
these cases, common non-intrusive solution strategies that involve repeated
simulations of the problem at different points in the parameter space quickly
become infeasible due to their long run-times. Intrusive methods however limit
the usability in combination with proprietary simulation engines. In our
previous paper [51], we demonstrated the application of a new non-intrusive
uncertainty quantification approach for Monte Carlo simulations in proton dose
calculations with normally distributed errors on realistic patient data. In
this paper, we introduce a generalized formulation and focus on a more in-depth
theoretical analysis of this method concerning bias, error and convergence of
the estimates. The multivariate input model of the proposed approach further
supports almost arbitrary error correlation models. We demonstrate how this
framework can be used to model and efficiently quantify complex auto-correlated
and time-dependent errors.

  Convex Region",,,,,"cs.IT cs.PF math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Critical transmission ranges (or radii) in wireless ad-hoc and sensor
networks have been extensively investigated for various performance metrics
such as connectivity, coverage, power assignment and energy consumption.
However, the regions on which the networks are distributed are typically either
squares or disks in existing works, which seriously limits the usage in
real-life applications. In this article, we consider a convex region (i.e., a
generalisation of squares and disks) on which wireless nodes are uniformly
distributed. We have investigated two types of critical transmission radii,
defined in terms of k-connectivity and the minimum vertex degree, respectively,
and have also established their precise asymptotic distributions. These make
the previous results obtained under the circumstance of squares or disks
special cases of this work. More importantly, our results reveal how the region
shape impacts on the critical transmission ranges: it is the length of the
boundary of the (fixed-area) region that completely determines the transmission
ranges. Furthermore, by isodiametric inequality, the smallest critical
transmission ranges are achieved when regions are disks only.
