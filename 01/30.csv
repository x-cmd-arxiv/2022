long-range hopping and explore to analytically solve the systems under some
specific boundary conditions. Although the introduction of long-range hopping
terms prevents us from finding analytical solutions for arbitrary boundary
parameters, we identify the existence of exact solutions when the boundary
parameters fulfill some constraint relations, which give the specific boundary
conditions. Our analytical results show that the wave functions take simple
forms and are independent of hopping range, while the eigenvalue spectra
display rich model-dependent structures. Particularly, we find the existence of
a special point coined as pseudo-periodic boundary condition, for which the
eigenvalues are the same as the periodical system when the hopping parameters
fulfill certain conditions, whereas eigenstates display non-Hermitian skin

by a complex interaction of several chemical (phase transformations), physical

microstructures, characterized by a hierarchy of defects ranging across several
orders of magnitude in length, including vacancies, dislocations, internal

propose a new methodological approach based on the Estrada communicability for
identifying communities on a multiplex network, based on a two-step
optimization. At first, we determine the optimal inter-layer intensity between
levels by minimizing a distance function. Hence, the optimal inter-layer
intensity is used to detect communities on each layer. Our findings show that
the community detection on this multiplex network has greater information power
than classical methods for single-layer networks. Our approach better reveals
clusters on each layer with respect to the application of the same approach on
each single-layer. Moreover, detected groups in the multiplex case benefit of a
higher cohesion, leading to identifying on each layer a lower number of

with the will to infer anything about their behavior in real life. It should be

understand magnetic ordering in 2D materials. This strategy couples the
prediction of the existence of magnetism in 2D materials using random forest
and the SHAP method with material maps defined by atomic features predicting
the magnetic ordering (ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic). While the random
forest model predicts magnetism with an accuracy of 86%, the material maps
obtained by the SISSO method have an accuracy of about 90% in predicting the
magnetic ordering. Our model indicates that 3d transition metals, halides, and
structural clusters with regular transition metals sublattices have a positive
contribution in the total weight deciding the existence of magnetism in 2D
compounds. This behavior is associated with the competition between crystal
field and exchange splitting. The machine learning model also indicates that
the atomic SOC is a determinant feature for the identification of the patterns
separating ferro- from antiferro-magnetic order. The proposed strategy is used
to identify novel 2D magnetic compounds which, together with the fundamental
trends in the chemical and structural space, paves novel routes for

reduce the data gap, active learning has been identified as a promising

methods for scientific computing problems (dominated by regression) where DNNs
are increasingly used. We show that modern pool-based DAL methods all share an
untunable hyperparameter, termed the pool ratio, denoted $\gamma$, which is

performance of five state-of-the-art DAL methods on six benchmark problems if
we assume $\gamma$ is \textit{not} known - a more realistic assumption for
scientific computing problems. Our results indicate that this reduces the
performance of modern DAL methods and that they sometimes can even perform
worse than random sampling, creating significant uncertainty when used in
real-world settings. To overcome this limitation we propose, to our knowledge,
the first query synthesis DAL method for regression, termed NA-QBC. NA-QBC
removes the sensitive $\gamma$ hyperparameter and we find that, on average, it

using digital hardware. Their conversion consists of two stages: Sampling,
which maps a continuous-time signal into discrete-time, and quantization, i.e.,
representing the continuous-amplitude quantities using a finite number of bits.
ADCs typically implement generic uniform conversion mappings that are ignorant
of the task for which the signal is acquired, and can be costly when operating
in high rates and fine resolutions. In this work we design task-oriented ADCs
which learn from data how to map an analog signal into a digital representation
such that the system task can be efficiently carried out. We propose a model
for sampling and quantization that facilitates the learning of non-uniform
mappings from data. Based on this learnable ADC mapping, we present a mechanism
for optimizing a hybrid acquisition system comprised of analog combining,
tunable ADCs with fixed rates, and digital processing, by jointly learning its
components end-to-end. Then, we show how one can exploit the representation of
hybrid acquisition systems as deep network to optimize the sampling rate and
quantization rate given the task by utilizing Bayesian meta-learning
techniques. We evaluate the proposed deep task-based ADC in two case studies:
the first considers symbol detection in multi-antenna digital receivers, where
multiple analog signals are simultaneously acquired in order to recover a set
of discrete information symbols. The second application is the beamforming of
analog channel data acquired in ultrasound imaging. Our numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves performance which is comparable

showers using three years of data recorded by the IceTop array at the South
Pole. Depending on the shower size, the muon densities have been measured at
lateral distances between 200 m and 1000 m. From these lateral distributions,
we derive the muon densities as functions of energy at reference distances of
600 m and 800 m for primary energies between 2.5 PeV and 40 PeV and between 9
PeV and 120 PeV, respectively. The muon densities are determined using, as a
baseline, the hadronic interaction model Sibyll 2.1 together with various
composition models. The measurements are consistent with the predicted muon
densities within these baseline interaction and composition models. The
measured muon densities have also been compared to simulations using the
post-LHC models EPOS-LHC and QGSJet-II.04. The result of this comparison is
that the post-LHC models together with any given composition model yield higher
muon densities than observed. This is in contrast to the observations above 1
EeV where all model simulations yield for any mass composition lower muon
densities than the measured ones. The post-LHC models in general feature higher
muon densities so that the agreement with experimental data at the highest
energies is improved but the muon densities are not correct in the energy range
between 2.5 PeV and about 100 PeV.

However, the gait characteristics of daily walking in real-world scenarios and

aimed to explore associations between depression symptom severity and
daily-life gait characteristics derived from acceleration signals in real-world
settings. In this study, we used two ambulatory datasets: a public dataset with
71 elder adults' 3-day acceleration signals collected by a wearable device, and
a subset of an EU longitudinal depression study with 215 participants and their
phone-collected acceleration signals (average 463 hours per participant). We
detected participants' gait cycles and force from acceleration signals and
extracted 20 statistics-based daily-life gait features to describe the
distribution and variance of gait cadence and force over a long-term period
corresponding to the self-reported depression score. The gait cadence of faster
steps (75th percentile) over a long-term period has a significant negative
association with the depression symptom severity of this period in both
datasets. Daily-life gait features could significantly improve the goodness of
fit of evaluating depression severity relative to laboratory gait patterns and
demographics, which was assessed by likelihood-ratio tests in both datasets.
This study indicated that the significant links between daily-life walking
characteristics and depression symptom severity could be captured by both
wearable devices and mobile phones. The gait cadence of faster steps in
daily-life walking has the potential to be a biomarker for evaluating
depression severity, which may contribute to clinical tools to remotely monitor
mental health in real-world settings.

  $B(t, \Delta t)$: a $t$ years old person NN will survive another $\Delta t$
years, where $t, \Delta t\in \mathbb{R}$ are nonnegative real numbers. We know
only that NN is $t$ years old and nothing about the health conditions, gender,
race, nationality, etc. We bet that $B(t, \Delta t)$ holds. It seems that our
odds are very good, for any $t$ provided $\Delta t$ is small enough, say, $1 /
365$ (that is, one day). However, this is not that obvious and depends on the
life-time probabilistic distribution. Let $F(t)$ denote the probability to live
at most $t$ years and set $\Phi(t) = 1 - F(t)$.
  Clearly, $\Phi(t) \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. It is not
difficult to verify that $Pr(B(t, \Delta t)) \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow
\infty$, for any fixed $\Delta t$, whenever the convergence of $\Phi$ is fast
enough (say, super-exponential). Statistics provide arguments (based on an
extrapolation yet) that this is the case. Hence, for an arbitrarily small
positive $\Delta t $ and $\epsilon$ there exists a sufficiently large $t$ such
that $Pr(B(t, \Delta t)) < \epsilon$, which means that we should not bet... in
theory. However, in practice we can bet safely, because for the inequality
$Pr(B(t, \Delta t)) < 1/2$ a very large $t$ is required. For example, $\Delta t
= 1/365$ may require $t > 125$ years for some typical distributions $F$
considered in the literature. Yet, on Earth there is no person of such age.
Thus, our odds are good, either because the chosen testee NN is not old enough,
or for technical (or, more precisely, statistical) reasons -- absence of a
testee. This situation is similar to the famous St.Petersburg Paradox.

pendubot angular position from its captured images. Initially, a baseline
algorithm is introduced to estimate the angle using conventional image
processing techniques. The baseline algorithm performs well for the cases that
the pendubot is not moving fast. However, when moving quickly due to a free
fall, the pendubot appears as a blurred object in the captured image in a way
that the baseline algorithm fails to estimate the angle. Consequently, a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based algorithm is introduced to cope with this challenge.
The approach relies on the concept of transfer learning to allow the training
of the DNN on a very small fine-tuning dataset. The base algorithm is used to

studied due to their multiple applications; scheduling problems and aircraft
assignments, for instance, motivate the robust coloring problem. This model
gets to capture natural constraints of those optimization problems by combining
the information provided by two colorings: a vertex coloring of a graph and the
induced edge coloring on a subgraph of its complement; the goal is to minimize,
among all proper colorings of the graph for a fixed number of colors, the
number of edges in the subgraph with the endpoints of the same color. The study
of the robust coloring model has been focused on the search for heuristics due
to its NP-hard character when using at least three colors, but little progress
has been made in other directions. We present a new approach on the problem
obtaining the first collection of non-heuristic results for general graphs;
among them, we prove that robust coloring is the model that better approaches
the equitable partition of the vertex set, even when the graph does not admit a
so-called \emph{equitable coloring}. We also show the NP-completeness of its
decision problem for the unsolved case of two colors, obtain bounds on the
associated robust coloring parameter, and solve a conjecture on paths that
illustrates the complexity of studying this coloring model.

respectively. The ABF design targets maximizing the intended signal power while
suppressing the strong self-interference (SI) occurred in the FD transmission.
Also, the proposed ABF technique only needs a single transmit and receive RF
chain to support large antenna arrays, thus, it reduces hardware
cost/complexity in the mMIMO systems. It is shown that the proposed FD-NC
offers a great improvement in bit error rate (BER) in comparison to both
half-duplex non-coherent (HD-NC) and HD coherent schemes. We also observe that
the proposed FD-NC both reduces the error floor resulted from the residual SI
in FD transmission, and provides lower BER compared to the FD coherent
transmission.

operations may lead to enormous increase in the tensor ranks (curse of ranks)
of the target data, making calculation intractable. Therefore one of the most
important steps in tensor calculations is the robust and efficient rank
reduction procedure which should be performed many times in the course of
various tensor transforms in multidimensional operator and function calculus.
The rank reduction scheme based on the Reduced Higher Order SVD (RHOSVD)
introduced in [33] played a significant role in the development of tensor
numerical methods. Here, we briefly survey the essentials of RHOSVD method and
then focus on some new theoretical and computational aspects of the RHOSVD
demonstrating that this rank reduction technique constitutes the basic
ingredient in tensor computations for real-life problems. In particular, the
stability analysis of RHOSVD is presented. We introduce the multilinear algebra
of tensors represented in the range-separated (RS) tensor format. This allows
to apply the RHOSVD rank-reduction techniques to non-regular functional data
with many singularities, for example, to the rank-structured computation of the
collective multi-particle interaction potentials in bio-molecular modeling, as
well as to complicated composite radial functions. The new theoretical and
numerical results on application of the RHOSVD in scattered data modeling are
presented. RHOSVD proved to be the efficient rank reduction technique in
numerous applications ranging from numerical treatment of multi-particle
systems up to a numerical solution of PDE constrained control problems.

and dispersion are analytically solved for axisymmetric rotating and growing
halos. The polar flow can be neglected and azimuthal flow is directly related
to dispersion. The fictitious (""Reynolds"") stress acts on mean flow to enable
energy transfer from mean flow to random motion and maximize system entropy.
For large halos (high peak height $\nu$ at early stage of halo life) with
constant concentration, there exists a self-similar radial flow (outward in
core and inward in outer region). Halo mass, size and specific angular momentum
increase linearly with time via fast mass accretion. Halo core spins faster
than outer region. Large halos rotate with an angular velocity proportional to
Hubble parameter and spin-induced dispersion is dominant. All specific energies
(radial/rotational/kinetic/potential) are time-invariant. Both halo spin
($\sim$0.031) and anisotropic parameters can be analytically derived. For
""small"" halos with stable core and slow mass accretion (low peak height $\nu$
at late stage of halo life), radial flow vanishes. Small halos rotate with
constant angular velocity and non-spin axial dispersion is dominant. Small
halos are spherical in shape, incompressible, and isotropic. Radial and
azimuthal dispersion are comparable and greater than polar dispersion. Due to
finite spin, kinetic energy is not equipartitioned with the greatest energy
along azimuthal direction. Different from normal matter, small halos are hotter
with faster spin. Halo relaxation from early to late stage involves variation
of shape, density, mean flow, momentum, and energy. During relaxation, halo
isotopically ""stretches"" with conserved specific rotational kinetic energy,
increasing concentration and momentum of inertial. Halo ""stretching"" leads to
decreasing angular velocity, increasing angular momentum and spin parameter.

  prediction",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online advertising has typically been more personalized than offline
advertising, through the use of machine learning models and real-time auctions
for ad targeting. One specific task, predicting the likelihood of conversion
(i.e.\ the probability a user will purchase the advertised product), is crucial
to the advertising ecosystem for both targeting and pricing ads. Currently,
these models are often trained by observing individual user behavior, but,
increasingly, regulatory and technical constraints are requiring
privacy-preserving approaches. For example, major platforms are moving to
restrict tracking individual user events across multiple applications, and
governments around the world have shown steadily more interest in regulating
the use of personal data. Instead of receiving data about individual user
behavior, advertisers may receive privacy-preserving feedback, such as the
number of installs of an advertised app that resulted from a group of users. In
this paper we outline the recent privacy-related changes in the online
advertising ecosystem from a machine learning perspective. We provide an
overview of the challenges and constraints when learning conversion models in
this setting. We introduce a novel approach for training these models that
makes use of post-ranking signals. We show using offline experiments on real
world data that it outperforms a model relying on opt-in data alone, and
significantly reduces model degradation when no individual labels are
available. Finally, we discuss future directions for research in this evolving
area.

address the communication bottleneck in distributed neural network training.
This paper presents a distributed model-parallel training framework that
enables training large neural networks on small CPU clusters with low Internet

the SLIDE algorithm. By carefully deploying sparsity over distributed nodes, we
demonstrate several orders of magnitude faster model parallel training than
Horovod, the main engine behind most commercial software. We show that with

service area by deep neural networks (DNN) and fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering.
The slow time-varying CSI between the base station (BS) and feasible UT
locations in the service area is calculated from the geospatial data by offline
ray tracing and a DNN-based path estimation model associated with the
1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and regression tree
ensembles. Then, the UT-level CSI of all feasible locations is grouped into
clusters by a proposed FCM clustering. Finally, the service area is divided
into a number of non-overlapping UT zones. Each UT zone is characterized by a
corresponding set of clusters named as UT-group CSI, which is utilized in the
analog RF beamformer design of AB-HP to reduce the required large online CSI
overhead in the MU-mMIMO systems. Then, the reduced-size online CSI is employed
in the baseband (BB) precoder of AB-HP. Simulations are conducted in the indoor
scenario at 28 GHz and tested in an AB-HP MU-mMIMO system with a uniform
rectangular array (URA) having 16x16=256 antennas and 22 RF chains.
Illustrative results indicate that 91.4% online CSI can be reduced by using the
proposed offline channel estimation technique as compared to the conventional

produces same amount of UT-level CSI with runtime reduced by 65.8% as compared

expansions in a (nonlinear) basis of the state variables. In the context of the
identification of governing equations of nonlinear dynamical systems, one faces
the problem of identifiability of model parameters when state measurements are
corrupted by noise. Measurement noise affects the stability of the recovery
process yielding incorrect sparsity patterns and inaccurate estimation of
coefficients of the governing equations. In this work, we investigate and
compare the performance of several local and global smoothing techniques to a

time-derivatives to improve the accuracy and robustness of two sparse

small changes in the training data can produce models that assign conflicting
predictions to individual data points during test time. In this work, we study
this sensitivity in recommender systems, where users' recommendations are
drastically altered by minor perturbations in other unrelated users'
interactions. We introduce a measure of stability for recommender systems,
called Rank List Sensitivity (RLS), which measures how rank lists generated by
a given recommender system at test time change as a result of a perturbation in
the training data. We develop a method, CASPER, which uses cascading effect to
identify the minimal and systematical perturbation to induce higher instability
in a recommender system. Experiments on four datasets show that recommender
models are overly sensitive to minor perturbations introduced randomly or via
CASPER - even perturbing one random interaction of one user drastically changes
the recommendation lists of all users. Importantly, with CASPER perturbation,
the models generate more unstable recommendations for low-accuracy users (i.e.,
those who receive low-quality recommendations) than high-accuracy ones.

the global minimum with a sublinear convergence rate. We demonstrate the

dependence on the projectile ground-state binding energy $\varepsilon_b$ is

reactions. To this end, apart from the experimental one-neutron separation
energy of $^8$Li nucleus ($\varepsilon_b=2.03$~MeV), lower values of
$\varepsilon_b$ down to $\varepsilon_b=0.01$~MeV, are also being considered. It
is shown that all breakup processes become peripheral as $\varepsilon_b\to
0.01$ MeV, which is understood as due to the well-known large spacial extension
of ground-state wave functions associated to weakly-bound projectiles. The
Coulomb breakup cross section is found to be more strongly dependent on
$\varepsilon_b$ than the nuclear breakup cross section, such that the Coulomb
breakup becomes more significant as $\varepsilon_b$ decreases, even in a
naturally nuclear-dominated reaction. This is mainly due to the long-range
nature of the Coulomb forces, leading to a direct dependence of the Coulomb
breakup on the electromagnetic transition matrix. It is also highlighted the
fact that the nuclear absorption plays a minor role for small binding when the
breakup becomes more peripheral.

sharing or pooling is important to mitigate negative externalities of

2019, we show that the willingness of riders to request a shared ride has
monotonically decreased from 27.0% to 12.8% throughout the year, while the trip
volume and mileage have remained statistically unchanged. We find that the
decline in sharing preference is due to an increased per-mile costs of shared
trips and shifting shorter trips to solo. Using ensemble machine learning
models, we find that the travel impedance variables (trip cost, distance, and
duration) collectively contribute to 95% and 91% of the predictive power in
determining whether a trip is requested to share and whether it is successfully
shared, respectively. Spatial and temporal attributes, sociodemographic, built
environment, and transit supply variables do not entail predictive power at the
trip level in presence of these travel impedance variables. This implies that
pricing signals are most effective to encourage riders to share their rides.
Our findings shed light on sharing behavior in ride-hailing trips and can help
devise strategies that increase shared ride-hailing, especially as the demand

acoustic behaviors, phonon dispersions, optical properties, and various
thermophysical properties of binary orthogonal and hexagonal Mo2C compounds in
details via first-principles calculations using the density functional theory
(DFT). The calculated ground state lattice parameters in both the symmetries
are in excellent agreement with available experimental results. The calculated
electronic band structure, density of states, and optical properties of Mo2C in
both structures reveal metallic features. The orthorhombic crystal shows higher
level mechanical and thermal anisotropy compared to that in the hexagonal
phase. The elastic constants and phonon dispersion calculations show that, in
both structures, Mo2C is mechanically and dynamically stable. A comprehensive
mechanical and thermophysical study shows that both phases possess high
structural stability, reasonably good machinability, ductile nature, high
hardness, low compressibility, high Debye temperature and high melting
temperature. Moreover, the electronic energy density of states, electron
density distribution, elastic properties, and Mulliken bond population analyses
indicate that the structures under consideration consist of mixed bonding
characteristics with ionic and covalent contributions. High reflectivity over
wide spectral range makes the compound suitable as reflecting coating. Both the
structures are efficient absorber of ultraviolet radiation. The refractive
indices are quite high in the infrared to visible range.

hard spectrum (the hard-TeV spectrum) after correcting for the extragalactic
background light. The hard-TeV spectra pose a challenge to conventional
one-zone models, including the leptonic model, the photohadronic model, the
proton synchrotron model, etc.
  Aims. In this work, we study if the one-zone hadronuclear (pp) model can be
used to interpret the hard-TeV spectra of BL Lacs without introducing extreme
parameters.
  Methods. We give analytical calculations to study if there is a parameter
space and the charge neutrality condition of jet can be satisfied when
interpreting the hard-TeV spectra of BL Lacs without introducing a
super-Eddington jet power.
  Results. We find that in a sample of hard-TeV BL Lacs collected by Xue et al.
(2019a), only the hard-TeV spectrum of 1ES 0229+200 could be explained by
gamma-ray from pi-0 decay produced in the pp interactions, but at the cost of
setting a small radius of the radiation region that comparable to the
Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole. Combining with previous studies
of other one-zone models, we suggest that the hard-TeV spectra of BL Lacs
cannot be explained by any one-zone models without introducing extreme
parameters, and should originate from the multiple radiation regions.

for any $n$-vertex graph, our algorithm with high probability outputs an
$\alpha$-approximate matching in a single pass using $O(n^2/\alpha^3)$ bits of

  A long line of work on the dynamic streaming matching problem has reduced the
gap between space upper and lower bounds first to $n^{o(1)}$ factors
[Assadi-Khanna-Li-Yaroslavtsev; SODA 2016] and subsequently to
$\text{polylog}{(n)}$ factors [Dark-Konrad; CCC 2020]. Our upper bound now
matches the Dark-Konrad lower bound up to $O(1)$ factors, thus completing this
research direction.
  Our approach consists of two main steps: we first (provably) identify a
family of graphs, similar to the instances used in prior work to establish the
lower bounds for this problem, as the only ""hard"" instances to focus on. These
graphs include an induced subgraph which is both sparse and contains a large
matching. We then design a dynamic streaming algorithm for this family of
graphs which is more efficient than prior work. The key to this efficiency is a
novel sketching method, which bypasses the typical loss of
$\text{polylog}{(n)}$-factors in space compared to standard $L_0$-sampling
primitives, and can be of independent interest in designing optimal algorithms
for other streaming problems.

that generalizes across object instances. Nevertheless, it often requires
expensive real-world data collection and manual specification of semantic
keypoints for each object category and task. Additionally, coarse keypoint
predictions and ignoring intermediate action sequences hinder adoption in
complex manipulation tasks beyond pick-and-place. This work proposes a novel,
category-level manipulation framework that leverages an object-centric,
category-level representation and model-free 6 DoF motion tracking. The
canonical object representation is learned solely in simulation and then used
to parse a category-level, task trajectory from a single demonstration video.
The demonstration is reprojected to a target trajectory tailored to a novel
object via the canonical representation. During execution, the manipulation
horizon is decomposed into longrange, collision-free motion and last-inch
manipulation. For the latter part, a category-level behavior cloning (CatBC)
method leverages motion tracking to perform closed-loop control. CatBC follows
the target trajectory, projected from the demonstration and anchored to a
dynamically selected category-level coordinate frame. The frame is
automatically selected along the manipulation horizon by a local attention
mechanism. This framework allows to teach different manipulation strategies by
solely providing a single demonstration, without complicated manual
programming. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy in a range of
challenging industrial tasks in highprecision assembly, which involve learning
complex, long-horizon policies. The process exhibits robustness against
uncertainty due to dynamics as well as generalization across object instances

the finite triplet component [T. Nakamura $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. B $\bf{

apparent contradiction with the previous STM result suggests that the nature of
superconductivity changes within the same system. From the analysis of the
quasiparticle interference patterns, we found that the Fermi energy is in the
close vicinity of the saddle point near the $\overline{\rm{M}}$ point. We
speculate that the nature of superconductivity varies depending on the
saddle-point energy with respect to the Fermi energy, which is sample-dependent
due to different band filling.

objects in the image at first. However, they require sizeable datasets with
fine-grained object annotation for training the object detector, which is a

  Efficient Image Classifier Search",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful tool for automating effective
image processing DNN designing. The ranking has been advocated to design an
efficient performance predictor for NAS. The previous contrastive method solves
the ranking problem by comparing pairs of architectures and predicting their
relative performance. However, it only focuses on the rankings between two
involved architectures and neglects the overall quality distributions of the
search space, which may suffer generalization issues. A predictor, namely
Neural Architecture Ranker (NAR) which concentrates on the global quality tier
of specific architecture, is proposed to tackle such problems caused by the
local perspective. The NAR explores the quality tiers of the search space
globally and classifies each individual to the tier they belong to according to
its global ranking. Thus, the predictor gains the knowledge of the performance
distributions of the search space which helps to generalize its ranking ability
to the datasets more easily. Meanwhile, the global quality distribution
facilitates the search phase by directly sampling candidates according to the
statistics of quality tiers, which is free of training a search algorithm,
e.g., Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), thus it
simplifies the NAS pipeline and saves the computational overheads. The proposed
NAR achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods on two widely
used datasets for NAS research. On the vast search space of NAS-Bench-101, the
NAR easily finds the architecture with top 0.01$\unicode{x2030}$ performance
only by sampling. It also generalizes well to different image datasets of
NAS-Bench-201, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-16-120 by identifying
the optimal architectures for each of them.

recent work, it was shown that a fleet of independent but neighboring vehicles
can cooperate for the task of localization by capitalizing on the existence of
common surrounding reflectors, using the concept of Team Channel-SLAM. This
approach exploits an initial (e.g. GPS-based) vehicle position information and
allows subsequent tracking of vehicles by exploiting the shared nature of
virtual transmitters associated to the reflecting surfaces. In this paper, we
show that the localization can be greatly enhanced by joint sensing and mapping
of reflecting surfaces. To this end, we propose a combined approach coined Team
Channel-SLAM Evolution (TCSE) which exploits the intertwined relation between
(i) the position of virtual transmitters, (ii) the shape of reflecting
surfaces, and (iii) the paths described by the radio propagation rays, in order
to achieve high-resolution vehicle localization. Overall, TCSE yields a
complete picture of the trajectories followed by dominant paths together with a
mapping of reflecting surfaces. While joint localization and mapping is a well
researched topic within robotics using inputs such as radar and vision, this
paper is first to demonstrate such an approach within mobile networking
framework based on radio data.

include APT injection attacks targeting vulnerable edge devices, insecure data
transportation, trust inconsistencies among stakeholders, incompliant data

computation capacity to stamp out unauthorized data or instructions, which in
essence, makes them exposed to attackers. When attackers target edge servers
while transporting data using traditional PKI-rendered trusts, consortium
blockchain (CBC) offers proven techniques to transfer and maintain those
sensitive data securely. With the recent improvement of edge machine learning,
edge devices can filter malicious data at their end which largely motivates us
to institute a Blockchain and AI aligned APT detection system. The unique
contributions of the paper include efficient APT detection at the edge and
transparent recording of the detection history in an immutable blockchain
ledger. In line with that, the certificateless data transfer mechanism boost
trust among collaborators and ensure an economical and sustainable mechanism

we consider the effects of the tidal charge on the energy extraction via the

With the increase of the tidal charge, we find that both the energies of the
accelerated plasma and decelerated plasma decrease for the observer located at
infinity. To achieve the purpose extracting the net energy from the black hole,
the decelerated plasma should take negative energy. Then we observe that the
power of the energy extraction via the magnetic reconnection grows with the

indicating that the spinning braneworld black hole with positive tidal charge
is more efficient than the Kerr black hole. Compared with the Blandford-Znajek

positive tidal charge. These results indicate that the tidal charge has a

can be assumed to have an ""approximate balance"" in the frequency of zeros and
ones of all sufficiently long substrings of all codewords. This allows us to
attain near-capacity-achieving codes in a general setting. We consider this
""approximate balance"" result to be of independent interest, as it can be cast

Causal mediation analysis provides a formal framework to identify causal
mechanisms through which a treatment affects an outcome. The most popular
identification strategy relies on so-called sequential ignorability (SI)
assumption which requires that there is no unobserved confounder that lies in
the causal paths between the treatment and the outcome. Despite its popularity,
such assumption is deemed to be too strong in many settings as it excludes the
existence of unobserved confounders. This limitation has inspired recent
literature to consider an alternative identification strategy based on an
instrumental variable (IV). This paper discusses the identification of causal
mediation effects in a setting with a binary treatment and a binary
instrumental variable that is both assumed to be random. We show that while IV
methods allow for the possible existence of unobserved confounders, additional
monotonicity assumptions are required unless the strong constant effect is
assumed. Furthermore, even when such monotonicity assumptions are satisfied, IV
estimands are not necessarily equivalent to target parameters.

strong unipolar charge injection from the bottom plate and a pressure gradient
along the streamwise direction. Highly-accurate numerical simulations and
weakly nonlinear stability analyses based on multiple-scale expansion and
amplitude expansion methods are used to unravel the nonlinear spatiotemporal
instability mechanisms in this combined flow. We found that the through-flow
makes the hysteresis loop in the EHD flow narrower. In the numerical simulation
of an impulse response, the leading and trailing edges of the wavepacket within
the nonlinear regime are consistent with the linear ones, a result which we
also verified against that in natural convection. In addition, as the
bifurcation in EHD-Poiseuille flows is of a subcritical nature, nonlinear
finite-amplitude solutions exist in the subcritical regime, and our calculation
indicates that they are convectively unstable. The validity of the
Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE), derived from the weakly nonlinear expansion of
Navier-Stokes equations and the Maxwell's equations in the quasi-electrostatic

coefficients in the GLE calculated using amplitude expansion method can predict
the absolute growth rates even when the parameters are away from the linear
critical conditions, compared favourably with the local dispersion relation,

tree hierarchy. Each level of the tree corresponds to an assembly of shape
parts, represented as implicit functions, to reconstruct the input shape. At
each node of the tree, simultaneous feature decoding and shape decomposition
are carried out by their respective feature and part decoders, with weight
sharing across the same hierarchy level. As an implicit field decoder, the part
decoder is designed to decompose a sub-shape, via a two-way branched
reconstruction, where each branch predicts a set of parameters defining a
Gaussian to serve as a local point distribution for shape reconstruction. With
reconstruction losses accounted for at each hierarchy level and a decomposition
loss at each node, our network training does not require any ground-truth
segmentations, let alone hierarchies. Through extensive experiments and
comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives, we demonstrate the quality,
consistency, and interpretability of hierarchical structural inference by
RIM-Net.

these weak subnets are correlated with the overall lack of robustness. Tackling
this phenomenon, we propose a new training procedure that identifies and

them via knowledge distillation from the full network. We show that EWS greatly
improves both robustness against corrupted images as well as accuracy on clean

consistently improves robustness when combined with these approaches. To
highlight the flexibility of our approach, we combine EWS also with popular

  Synergistic Interaction Between Defect Trapping and Auger Effect","18 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.str-el","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Strong Coulomb interactions in two-dimensional systems, together with quantum
confinement, make many-body processes particularly effective for carrier
dynamics, which plays a crucial role in determining carrier lifetime,
photoconductivity, and emission yield of the materials. Hereby, by using
optical pump and terahertz probe spectroscopy, we have investigated the
photocarrier dynamics in the PdSe2 films with different thickness. The
experimental results reveal that the photocarrier relaxation consists of two
components: a fast component of 2.5 ps that shows the layer-thickness
independence, and a slow component has typical lifetime of 7.3 ps decreasing
with the layer thickness. Surprisingly, the relaxation times for both fast and
slow components are exhibited both pump fluence and temperature independence,
which suggests that synergistic interactions between defect trapping and Auger
effect dominate the photocarrier dynamics in PdSe2 films. A model involving
defect-assisted Auger process is proposed, which can reproduce the experimental
results well. The fitting results reveal that the layer dependent lifetime is
determined by the defect density rather than carrier occupancy rate after
photoexcitation. Our results underscore the interplay between Auger process and
defects in two-dimensional semiconductors.

based on the spherical-harmonic expansion of the neutrino luminosity to obtain
the gravitational waveform as well as the characteristic strain. In the absence
of multi-dimensional simulations of PNS cooling, from which we can extract
reliable data on the neutrino luminosities as a function of solid angle, we
construct them by hand. In the first model, the time evolution is approximated
by piece-wise exponential functions (PEFs); in the second model we employ the
time evolution obtained in a 1D cooling simulation for all harmonic components
for simplicity; In both cases, we consider not only axisymmetric components but
also non-axisymmetric ones; for the latter, in particular, we consider as the
third model axisymetric neutrino emissions that are misaligned with the
rotation axis and, as a result, rotate with the PNS. We find from the first
model that the decay times in PEF at late phases can be inferred from the
positions of bumps and dips in the characteristic strain of the GW in the case
of a slow cooling, whereas it may be obtained by identifying the positions of
slope change in the case of rapid cooling, which may be induced by convections
in PNS. We also find from the first model that the rotation of PNS can be
reflected in GW waveforms. Finally, we compared the characteristic strains with
sensitivity curves GW detectors, finding that above phenomena are expected to
be detected by DECIGO if the PNS is located at 10kpc.

superradiant behavior the Dicke model is well-known for, the addition of
spontaneous emission combined with the presence of strong counter-rotating
terms creates laser-like behavior termed counter-lasing. These states appear in
the semiclassical model as stable periodic orbits. We perform a comprehensive
dynamical analysis of the appearance of counter-lasing in the unbalanced Dicke
model subject to strong cavity dissipation, such that the cavity field can be
adiabatically eliminated to yield an effective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG)
model. If the coupling strength of the co-rotating interactions is small, then
the counter-lasing phase appears via a Hopf bifurcation of the de-excited
state. We find that if the rate of spontaneous emission is small, this can lead
to resurgent superradiant pulses. However, if the co-rotating coupling is
larger, then the counter-lasing phase must emerge via the steady-state
superradiant phase. Such a transition is the result of the competition of the
coherent and incoherent processes that drive superradiance and counter-lasing,
respectively. We observe a surprisingly complex transition between the two,
associated with the formation of a chaotic attractor over a thin transitional
parameter region.

interactive scenarios of autonomous vehicles, where the features of interactive

simulated experiment in the SUMO platform is carried out to evaluate the

self-attention mechanism, has been successful in natural language processing
and computer vision recently. Convolutional Neural Networks, capable of
capturing local features, are difficult to model explicit long-distance
dependencies from global feature space. However, both local and global features
are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image
segmentation. In this paper, we present the further attempt to exploit
Transformer in 3D CNN for 3D medical image volumetric segmentation and propose
a novel network named TransBTSV2 based on the encoder-decoder structure.
Different from TransBTS, the proposed TransBTSV2 is not limited to brain tumor
segmentation (BTS) but focuses on general medical image segmentation, providing
a stronger and more efficient 3D baseline for volumetric segmentation of
medical images. As a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, TransBTSV2 can
achieve accurate segmentation of medical images without any pre-training,
possessing the strong inductive bias as CNNs and powerful global context
modeling ability as Transformer. With the proposed insight to redesign the
internal structure of Transformer block and the introduced Deformable
Bottleneck Module to capture shape-aware local details, a highly efficient
architecture is achieved with superior performance. Extensive experimental
results on four medical image datasets (BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, LiTS 2017 and
KiTS 2019) demonstrate that TransBTSV2 achieves comparable or better results
compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumor,
liver tumor as well as kidney tumor. Code will be publicly available at

generalization. While sparse datasets show the same performances under SLN and
PLN for an equal amount of noise, SLN outperforms PLN in the overparametrized
region in dense datasets. Indeed, in this regime, PLN similarity violation
becomes macroscopical, corrupting the dataset to the point where complete
overfitting cannot be achieved. We call this phenomenon Density-Induced Break
of Similarity (DIBS). Probing the equivalence between online optimization and
offline generalization in SNNs, we find that their correspondence breaks down
in the presence of label noise for all the scenarios considered.

peers, but these networks currently do not have any provable guarantees for
desirable properties such as Byzantine fault tolerance, good connectivity and

exploited unsafe peer connection policies and weak network synchronization to
mount partitioning attacks on Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency blockchains are safety
critical systems, so we need principled algorithms to maintain their networks.
  Our key insight is that we can leverage the blockchain itself to share
information among the peers, and thus simplify the network maintenance process.
Given that the peers have restricted computational resources, and at most a
constant fraction of them are Byzantine, we provide communication-efficient
protocols to maintain a hypercubic network for blockchains, where peers can
join and leave over time. Interestingly, we discover that our design can
\emph{recover} from substantial adversarial failures. Moreover, these

  A key contribution is a secure mechanism for joining the network that uses
the blockchain to help new peers to contact existing peers. Furthermore, by
examining how peers join the network, i.e., the ""bootstrapping service,"" we
give a lower bound showing that (within log factors) our network tolerates the

with bilocal Ricci scalar and negative cosmological constant. Besides their
connection to the cosmological constant, these solutions depend on a
fundamental length due to their non-local nature. The effective profile
densities that result from the non-local geometries have quasi-localized
mass/energy since they are finite at the origin and their integration in all
space is convergent. The black holes obtained are free of singularities and
present one, two, or none horizons depending on the values of the involved
parameters. The new solutions can have either an AdS, dS, or even a flat core.
In the case of a de-Sitter core, it could represent a repulsive force coming
from quantum effects. Although the resulting (effective) cosmological constant
is positive near the origin, the classical (naked) counterpart is still
negative thus precluding a cosmological horizon. We investigate the energy
conditions of the effective source and determine the region where exotic energy
should be found. Thermodynamic quantities are also computed. On the one hand,
Gibbs's potential shows that both solutions are globally unstable, as in the
BTZ case. On the other, we show that for small values of the horizon radius the
Hawking temperature is negatively divergent but a finite size remnant can be
defined where $T_H$ crosses zero. At this point, the heat capacity sign changes
from negative to positive, indicating that the black holes are locally stable
while irradiating. Thus, such a quantity, along with $T_H$, presents crucial
differences with the BTZ black hole for small horizon radii where quantum
effects become relevant. Finally, we analyze the bilocal black hole geodesics
and find stable circular orbits for massless and massive particles, another
feature absent in the BTZ case.

efficient gradient-decent algorithm based on the automatically differentiable
tensors is proposed. We here take matrix product state (MPS) as an example,
whose complexity scales only linearly with the system size. We apply our
approach to solve the ground state of coupled harmonic oscillators, and achieve
high accuracy by comparing with the exact solutions. Reliable results are also
given with the presence of three-body interactions, where the system cannot be
decoupled to isolated oscillators. Our approach is simple and with
well-controlled error, superior to the highly-nonlinear neural-network solvers.
Our work extends the applications of tensor network from quantum lattice models
to the systems in the continuous space. FTN can be used as a general solver of
the differential equations with many variables. The MPS exemplified here can be
generalized to, e.g., the fermionic tensor networks, to solve the electronic
Schr\""odinger equation.

extensively used for data in non-Euclidean domains. In particular, hyperbolic
neural networks have proved successful in processing hierarchical information

during training, which precludes using complex architectures. This crucial
problem makes it difficult to build hyperbolic generative models for real and
complex data. In this work, we propose a hyperbolic generative network in which
we design novel architecture and layers to improve stability in training. Our
proposed network contains three parts: first, a hyperbolic autoencoder (AE)
that produces hyperbolic embedding for input data; second, a hyperbolic
generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating the hyperbolic latent
embedding of the AE from simple noise; third, a generator that inherits the
decoder from the AE and the generator from the GAN. We call this network the
hyperbolic AE-GAN, or HAEGAN for short. The architecture of HAEGAN fosters
expressive representation in the hyperbolic space, and the specific design of
layers ensures numerical stability. Experiments show that HAEGAN is able to
generate complex data with state-of-the-art structure-related performance.

the network complexity. Extensive studies excavate gradient-driven sparsity.
Typically, these methods are constructed upon premise of weight independence,
which however, is contrary to the fact that weights are mutually influenced.
Thus, their performance remains to be improved. In this paper, we propose to
optimize gradient-driven sparsity (OptG) by solving this independence paradox.
Our motive comes from the recent advances in supermask training which shows
that high-performing sparse subnetworks can be located by simply updating mask
values without modifying any weight. We prove that supermask training is to
accumulate the criteria of gradient-driven sparsity for both removed and
preserved weights, and it can partly solve the independence paradox.
Consequently, OptG integrates supermask training into gradient-driven sparsity,
and a novel supermask optimizer is further proposed to comprehensively mitigate
the independence paradox. Experiments show that OptG can well surpass many
existing state-of-the-art competitors, especially at ultra-high sparsity
levels. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/zyxxmu/OptG}.

However, prior works either fuse saliency maps of the same image or saliency
maps of different images to extract the expected foregrounds. Also, they rely
on hand-crafted saliency extraction and correspondence processes in most cases.
This paper revisits the problem and proposes fusing saliency maps of both the

unclear whether the obliquities reflect the planets' dynamical history (e.g.,
aligned for in situ formation or disk migration versus misaligned for
high-eccentricity tidal migration) or whether other mechanisms (e.g.,
primordial misalignment or planet-star interactions) are more important in
sculpting the obliquity distribution. Here we present the stellar obliquity
measurement of TOI-1268 (TIC-142394656, $V_{\rm mag} {\sim} 10.9$), a young
K-type dwarf hosting an 8.2-day period, Saturn-sized planet. TOI-1268's lithium
abundance and rotation period suggest the system age between the ages of
Pleiades cluster (${\sim}120$ Myr) and Praesepe cluster (${\sim}670$ Myr).
Using the newly commissioned NEID spectrograph, we constrain the stellar
obliquity of TOI-1268 via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect from both radial
velocity (RV) and Doppler Tomography (DT) signals. The 3$\sigma$ upper bounds
of the projected stellar obliquity $|\lambda|$ from both models are below
60$^\circ$. The large host star separation ($a/R_\star {\sim} 17$), combined
with the system's young age, makes it unlikely that the planet has realigned
its host star. The stellar obliquity measurement of TOI-1268 probes the
architecture of a young gas giant beyond the reach of tidal realignment
($a/R_\star {\gtrsim} 10$) and reveals an aligned or slightly misaligned

aided with the EUV data from AIA and line-of-sight magnetograms from HMI on
board SDO. The microeruptions are situated on magnetic polarity inversion lines
(PILs), and their roots are accurately traced down to intergranular lanes.
Their durations are different, two microeruptions are repetitive microjets,
lasting ~ 50 and 27 minutes respectively, while the other two events are
singular, lasting ~ 5 minutes. For the two microjets, they are continuous and
recurrent in He I 10830 \r{A} band, and the recurrence is quasi-periodic with
the period of ~ 5 minutes. We found that only transient co-spatial EUV
brightenings are observed for the longer duration microjets and EUV
brightenings are absent for the two singular microeruptions. What is essential
to the longer duration microjets is that granules with the concentration of
positive magnetic field persistently transport the magnetic field to the PILs,
canceling the opposite magnetic flux and making the base of the two microjets
and the underlying granules migrate with the speed of ~ 0.25 and 1.0 km/s. The
observations support the scenario of magnetic reconnection for the
quasi-periodic microjets and further show that the reconnection continuously

potential destinations of them. Especially under a very limited observation,
travelers tend to show random movement patterns and usually have a large number
of potential destinations, which make them difficult to handle for mobility
prediction (e.g., destination prediction). In this paper, we develop a new
knowledge graph-based framework (PDPFKG) for potential destination discovery of
low predictability travelers by considering trip association relationships
between them. We first construct a trip knowledge graph (TKG) to model the trip
scenario by entities (e.g., travelers, destinations and time information) and
their relationships, in which we introduce the concept of private relationship
for complexity reduction. Then a modified knowledge graph embedding algorithm
is implemented to optimize the overall graph representation. Based on the trip
knowledge graph embedding model (TKGEM), the possible ranking of individuals'
unobserved destinations to be chosen in the future can be obtained by
calculating triples' distance. Empirically. PDPFKG is tested using an anonymous
vehicular dataset from 138 intersections equipped with video-based vehicle
detection systems in Xuancheng city, China. The results show that (i) the
proposed method significantly outperforms baseline methods, and (ii) the
results show strong consistency with traveler behavior in choosing potential
destinations. Finally, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the innovative
points of the methodology.

complex (cc) whose cells are defined simply as finite sets of vertices. The
cells of a cc are subject to four axioms involving a rank function that assigns
a rank (or a dimension) to each cell. Our framework focuses on classes of cc
admitting an inclusion-reversing duality map. We introduce a combinatorial
notion of cobordism that allows us to single out a category whose morphisms are
cobordisms having a causal structure. Our aim is to offer an approach to look
for a combinatorial notion of quantum field theory having a built-in duality
operation acting on the underlying space and not relying on any manifold
structure. The introduction includes links with fields in Theoretical and
Mathematical Physics related to Quantum Gravity and motivating our framework.
We start by introducing cc and the duality map on a class of cc with empty
boundary called closed cc. We then focus on the problem of reconstructing a
certain class of cc from their cells of rank 2 and lower. Such cc are in
particular duals to simplicial complexes with no boundary and their
reconstruction is realized using a discrete notion of connection. Our next main
result extends the duality map we defined on closed cc to a class of cc with
boundary. An important by-product of the study of this extended duality map is
the combinatorial notion of cobordism used in this work. We also introduce a
general notion of subdivision of a cc via a map called reduction, as well as
the dual notion of reduction called collapse. These two types of map
characterize the structure of certain cc called slices, using sequences of maps
called slice sequences. Slices are the basic building blocs of our definition
of causal cobordisms and the dual of a slice sequence defines the composition
of cobordisms, providing us with a category whose morphisms are causal
cobordisms.

we study the low-energy band structure of double-kagome-layered

only opens a small gap, resulting effectively gapless ARPES spectra, yet
generating large spin Berry curvature. These type-II DNLs, together with the
interaction between a low-energy van Hove singularity and quasi-1D band as we
observed in the same material, suggest CsV$_8$Sb$_{12}$ as an ideal platform
for exploring novel transport properties such as chiral anomaly, the Klein

learning model capable of classifying different types of DDoS attacks and
predicting the quality of 5G latency. The initial steps of implementation
involved the synthetic addition of 5G parameters into the dataset.
Subsequently, the data was label encoded, and minority classes were oversampled
to match the other classes. Finally, the data was split as training and
testing, and machine learning models were applied. Although the paper resulted
in a model that predicted DDoS attacks, the dataset acquired significantly
lacked 5G related information. Furthermore, the 5G classification model needed
more modification. The research was based on largely quantitative research
methods in a simulated environment. Hence, the biggest limitation of this
research has been the lack of resources for data collection and sole reliance

greatly benefit from an autonomous 5G enabled vehicle connected to a mobile

conducive to soliton-assisted energy transport. The nonlinear interaction
between amide I excitons and phonon deformations induced in the hydrogen-bonded
lattice of peptide groups leads to self-trapping of the amide I energy, thereby
creating a localized quasiparticle (soliton) that persists at zero temperature.
The presence of thermal noise, however, could destabilize the protein soliton
and dissipate its energy within a finite lifetime. In this work, we have
computationally solved the system of stochastic differential equations that
govern the quantum dynamics of protein solitons at physiological temperature,
T=310 K, for either a single isolated $\alpha$-helix spine of hydrogen bonded
peptide groups or the full protein $\alpha$-helix comprised of three parallel
$\alpha$-helix spines. The simulated stochastic dynamics revealed that although
the thermal noise is detrimental for the single isolated $\alpha$-helix spine,
the cooperative action of three amide I exciton quanta in the full protein
$\alpha$-helix ensures soliton lifetime of over 30 ps, during which the amide I
energy could be transported along the entire extent of an 18-nm-long
$\alpha$-helix. Thus, macromolecular protein complexes, which are built up of
protein $\alpha$-helices could harness soliton-assisted energy transport at
physiological temperature. Because the hydrolysis of a single adenosine
triphosphate molecule is able to initiate three amide I exciton quanta, it is
feasible that multiquantal protein solitons subserve a variety of specialized
physiological functions in living systems.

Non-clinical ECG recordings acquired by Holter and wearable ECG sensors often

Usually, a set of such artifacts occur on the same ECG signal with varying
severity and duration, and this makes an accurate diagnosis by machines or
medical doctors extremely difficult. Despite numerous studies that have
attempted ECG denoising, they naturally fail to restore the actual ECG signal
corrupted with such artifacts due to their simple and naive noise model. In
this study, we propose a novel approach for blind ECG restoration using
cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (Cycle-GANs) where the quality
of the signal can be improved to a clinical level ECG regardless of the type
and severity of the artifacts corrupting the signal. To further boost the
restoration performance, we propose 1D operational Cycle-GANs with the
generative neuron model. The proposed approach has been evaluated extensively

under 5. 70% of worldwide pneumonia deaths occur in only 15 countries,
including Bangladesh. Previous research has indicated a potential association
between the incidence of pneumonia and the presence of cross-ventilation in
slum housing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The objective of this research is to
establish a validated computational framework that can predict ventilation
rates in slum homes to support further studies investigating this correlation.
To achieve this objective we employ a building thermal model (BTM) in
combination with uncertainty quantification (UQ). The BTM solves for the
time-evolution of volume-averaged temperatures in a typical home, considering
different ventilation configurations. The UQ method propagates uncertainty in
model parameters, weather inputs, and physics models to predict mean values and
95% confidence intervals for the quantities of interest, namely temperatures
and ventilation rates in terms of air changes per hour (ACH). The model
predictions are compared to on-site field measurements of air and thermal mass
temperatures, and of ACH. The results indicate that the use of standard cross-
or single-sided ventilation models limits the accuracy of the ACH predictions;
in contrast, a model based on a similarity relationship informed by the
available ACH measurements can produce more accurate predictions with
confidence intervals that encompass the measurements for 12 of the 17 available
data points.

  Collapse Models","10 pages, 10 figures. Formalization was changed; revised argument in

  Phys. Rev. D",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.106.123012",,"astro-ph.HE hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is a powerful future tool to
constrain core-collapse explosion mechanisms without observation of a nearby
event, and the corresponding signal has been calculated for a variety of
collapse models. For Supernova (SN) 1987A, a peculiar double neutrino burst was
detected, but models for the double collapse have never been studied in the
DSNB context. Here, we fill this gap and compare the DSNB signal expected in
the Standard Collapse (SC) and the Double Collapse (DC) models in various
future detectors, including Hyper-Kamiokande, JUNO, DUNE and the Large Baksan
Neutrino Telescope (LBNT). We calculate the spectra of diffuse neutrinos and
antineutrinos in the DC model and determine the rate of registered events as a
function of energy of the detected particle, taking into account detector
parameters. For each detector, we estimate the corresponding uncertainties and
the background and compare the signals expected for the SC and DC models. We
conclude that the combination of DUNE and LBNT data will have the highest
sensitivity to discriminate between the SC and DC models.

$a_M$ as the third fundamental constant of nature in addition to $c$ and $h$.
To this aim we use the concept of Newtonian triangle in the $(log(r),~ log(m))$
plane and show that excited states on hadronic Regge trajectories lead into the
MOND regime beyond this triangle. The experimentally suggested freezing of one
internal spatial degree of quark freedom in excited baryons corroborates then
the conjecture that MOND is related to the idea of space emergence.

  Intelligence)","11 pages",,,,"cs.AI cs.IT cs.LO math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As is known, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), unlike AI, should operate
with meanings. And that's what distinguishes it from AI. Any successful AI
implementations (playing chess, unmanned driving, face recognition etc.) do not
operate with the meanings of the processed objects in any way and do not
recognize the meaning. And they don't need to. But for AGI, which emulates
human thinking, this ability is crucial. Numerous attempts to define the
concept of ""meaning"" have one very significant drawback - all such definitions
are not strict and formalized, so they cannot be programmed. The meaning search
procedure should use a formalized description of its existence and possible
forms of its perception. For the practical implementation of AGI, it is
necessary to develop such ""ready-to-code"" descriptions in the context of their
use for processing the related cognitive concepts of ""meaning"" and ""knowledge"".
An attempt to formalize the definition of such concepts is made in this
article.

Patil, \v{Z}iga Kos, J\""orn Dunkel","Harmonic flow field representations of quantum bits and gates",,,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe a general procedure for mapping arbitrary $n$-qubit states to
two-dimensional (2D) vector fields. The mappings use complex rational function
representations of individual qubits, producing classical vector field
configurations that can be interpreted in terms of 2D inviscid fluid flows or
electric fields. Elementary qubits are identified with localized defects in 2D
harmonic vector fields, and multi-qubit states find natural field
representations via complex superpositions of vector field products. In
particular, separable states appear as highly symmetric flow configurations,
making them both dynamically and visually distinct from entangled states. The
resulting real-space representations of entangled qubit states enable an
intuitive visualization of their transformations under quantum logic
operations. We demonstrate this for the quantum Fourier transform and the
period finding process underlying Shor's algorithm, along with other quantum
algorithms. Due to its generic construction, the mapping procedure suggests the
possibility of extending concepts such as entanglement or entanglement entropy
to classical continuum systems, and thus may help guide new experimental
approaches to information storage and non-standard computation.
