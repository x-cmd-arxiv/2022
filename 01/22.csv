problem that needs to be mitigated to improve our Web experience. This work
contributes to research efforts to detect and understand hateful content on the
Web by undertaking a multimodal analysis of Antisemitism and Islamophobia on
4chan's /pol/ using OpenAI's CLIP. This large pre-trained model uses the
Contrastive Learning paradigm. We devise a methodology to identify a set of
Antisemitic and Islamophobic hateful textual phrases using Google's Perspective
API and manual annotations. Then, we use OpenAI's CLIP to identify images that
are highly similar to our Antisemitic/Islamophobic textual phrases. By running
our methodology on a dataset that includes 66M posts and 5.8M images shared on
4chan's /pol/ for 18 months, we detect 173K posts containing 21K
Antisemitic/Islamophobic images and 246K posts that include 420 hateful
phrases. Among other things, we find that we can use OpenAI's CLIP model to
detect hateful content with an accuracy score of 0.81 (F1 score = 0.54). By
comparing CLIP with two baselines proposed by the literature, we find that CLIP
outperforms them, in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1 score, in detecting
Antisemitic/Islamophobic images. Also, we find that Antisemitic/Islamophobic
imagery is shared in a similar number of posts on 4chan's /pol/ compared to
Antisemitic/Islamophobic textual phrases, highlighting the need to design more
tools for detecting hateful imagery. Finally, we make available (upon request)
a dataset of 246K posts containing 420 Antisemitic/Islamophobic phrases and 21K
likely Antisemitic/Islamophobic images (automatically detected by CLIP) that
can assist researchers in further understanding Antisemitism and Islamophobia.

1000 magnitudes between phase 0 to 1 with step length 0.001 for each light
curves in identifying resonances for fundamental mode (FU) and first overtone
(FO) Cepheids and in the classification of variable stars for Large Magellanic

seen that the performance of ICA is better for finding resonances for Cepheid
variables as well as for accurately classifying large data sets of light curves
than PCA. Using K-means clustering algorithm (CA) with respect to independent
components (ICs), we have plotted period-luminosity diagrams and
colour-magnitude diagrams separately for LMC, SMC and MW and found that ICA
along with K-means CA is a very robust tool for classification as well as
future prediction on the nature of light curves of variable stars.

observations have been performed with transmission spectroscopy, although UHJs
are also ideal targets for emission spectroscopy due to their strong thermal
radiation. We present high-resolution thermal emission spectroscopy of the
transiting UHJ KELT-20b/MASCARA-2b. The observation was performed with the
CARMENES spectrograph at orbital phases before and after the secondary eclipse.
We detected atomic Fe using the cross-correlation technique. The detected Fe
lines are in emission, which unambiguously indicates a temperature inversion on
the dayside hemisphere. We furthermore retrieved the temperature structure with
the detected Fe lines. The result shows that the atmosphere has a strong
temperature inversion with a temperature of $4900\pm{700}$ K and a pressure of
$10^{-4.8_{-1.1}^{+1.0}}$ bar at the upper layer of the inversion. A joint

The detection of such a strong temperature inversion is consistent with

interstellar medium (ISM) and the self-regulation of star formation in giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) by injecting energy, momentum, and radiation (stellar
feedback) into surrounding environments, disrupting the parental clouds, and
regulating further star formation. Information of the stellar feedback inheres
in the emission we observe, however inferring the physical properties from
photometric and spectroscopic measurements is difficult, because stellar
feedback is a highly complex and non-linear process, so that the observational
data are highly degenerate. On this account, we introduce a novel method that
couples a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) with the
WARPFIELD-emission predictor (WARPFIELD-EMP) to estimate the physical
properties of star-forming regions from spectral observations. We present a
cINN that predicts the posterior distribution of seven physical parameters
(cloud mass, star formation efficiency, cloud density, cloud age which means
age of the first generation stars, age of the youngest cluster, the number of
clusters, and the evolutionary phase of the cloud) from the luminosity of 12
optical emission lines, and test our network with synthetic models that are not
used during training. Our network is a powerful and time-efficient tool that
can accurately predict each parameter, although degeneracy sometimes remains in
the posterior estimates of the number of clusters. We validate the posteriors
estimated by the network and confirm that they are consistent with the input
observations. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties on
the network performance.

of $\sim 10^9\rm\, M_\odot$ supermassive black holes (BHs) within the first
billion year of the Universe. This critical regime is associated with
radiatively inefficient accretion and accompanied by powerful outflows in the
form of winds and jets. By means of hydrodynamical simulations of BH evolution
in an isolated galaxy and its host halo with 12 pc resolution, we investigate
how super-Eddington feedback affects the mass growth of the BH. It is shown
that super-Eddington feedback efficiently prevents BH growth within a few Myr.
The super-Eddington accretion events remain relatively mild with typical rates
of about 2-3 times the Eddington limit, because of the efficient regulation by
jets in that regime. We find that these jets are powerful enough to eject gas
from the centre of the host galaxy all the way up to galactic scales at a few
kpc, but do not significantly impact gas inflows at those large scales. By
varying the jet feedback efficiency, we find that weaker super-Eddington jets
allow for more significant BH growth through more frequent episodes of
super-Eddington accretion. We conclude that effective super-Eddington growth is
possible, as we find that simulations with weak jet feedback efficiencies
provide a slightly larger BH mass evolution over long periods of time ($\sim
80\,\rm Myr$) than that for a BH accreting at the Eddington limit.

practical benefits of quantum computers, having a clear definition and
evaluation scheme for assessing practical quantum advantage in the context of
specific applications is paramount. Generative modeling, for example, is a
widely accepted natural use case for quantum computers, and yet has lacked a
concrete approach for quantifying success of quantum models over classical
ones. In this work, we construct a simple and unambiguous approach to probe
practical quantum advantage for generative modeling by measuring the
algorithm's generalization performance. Using the sample-based approach
proposed here, any generative model, from state-of-the-art classical generative
models such as GANs to quantum models such as Quantum Circuit Born Machines,
can be evaluated on the same ground on a concrete well-defined framework. In
contrast to other sample-based metrics for probing practical generalization, we
leverage constrained optimization problems (e.g., cardinality-constrained
problems) and use these discrete datasets to define specific metrics capable of
unambiguously measuring the quality of the samples and the model's
generalization capabilities for generating data beyond the training set but
still within the valid solution space. Additionally, our metrics can diagnose
trainability issues such as mode collapse and overfitting, as we illustrate
when comparing GANs to quantum-inspired models built out of tensor networks.
Our simulation results show that our quantum-inspired models have up to a $68
\times$ enhancement in generating unseen unique and valid samples compared to
GANs, and a ratio of 61:2 for generating samples with better quality than those
observed in the training set. We foresee these metrics as valuable tools for
rigorously defining practical quantum advantage in the domain of generative
modeling.

data ranging from UV to IR wavelengths. In 8 BSS candidates, a single
temperature SED is found to be satisfactory. We discover hot companions in 5
BSS candidates. The hot companions with Teff $\sim$11750-15500 K, R
$\sim$0.069-0.242 R$_{\odot}$, and L $\sim$0.25-1.55 L$_{\odot}$, are most
likely extremely low mass (ELM) white dwarfs (WDs) with masses smaller than
$\sim$0.18 M$_{\odot}$, and thereby confirmed post mass transfer systems. We
discuss the implication of this finding in the context of BSS formation
mechanisms. Two additional BSS show excess in one or more UV filters, and may
have a hot companion, however, we are unable to characterize them. We suggest
that at least 5 of the 15 BSS candidates (33%) studied in this cluster have
formed via the mass transfer mechanism.

that an optimal one for all strategy fails to be inconspicuous, while it is
unclear whether an optimal two for one strategy satisfies the inconspicuousness

We propose a novel method that mitigates attacks by smart jammers on massive

approach builds on recent progress in joint channel estimation and data

potential of the LPP is so diverse that it generates considerable interest for

characterization techniques developed for other plasma sources can be used to
characterize the LPPs, care must be taken to interpret the results because of
their small size, transient nature, and inhomogeneities. The existence of the
large spatiotemporal density and temperature gradients often necessitates
non-uniform weighted averaging over distance and time. Among the various plasma
characterization tools, optical-based diagnostic tools play a key role in the
accurate measurements of LPP parameters. The optical toolbox contains optical
probing methods (Thomson scattering, shadowgraphy, Schlieren, interferometry,
velocimetry, and deflectometry), optical spectroscopy (emission, absorption,
and fluorescence), and passive and active imaging. Each technique is useful for
measuring a specific property, and its use is limited to a certain time span
during the LPP evolution because of the sensitivity issues related to the
selected measuring tool. Therefore, multiple diagnostic tools are essential for
a comprehensive insight into the entire plasma behavior. In recent times, the
improvements in performance in the lasers and detector systems expanded the
capability of the aforementioned passive and active diagnostics tools. This

  Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and embeddings",,,,,"math.AP math.FA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we develop a new set of results based on a nonlocal gradient
jointly inspired by the Riesz s-fractional gradient and Peridynamics, in the
sense that its integration domain depends on a ball of radius delta > 0
(horizon of interaction among particles, in the terminology of Peridynamics),
while keeping at the same time the singularity of the Riesz potential in its
integration kernel. Accordingly, we define a functional space suitable for
nonlocal models in Calculus of Variations and partial differential equations.
Our motivation is to develop the proper functional analysis framework in order
to tackle nonlocal models in Continuum Mechanics, which requires working with
bounded domains, while retaining the good mathematical properties of Riesz
s-fractional gradients. This functional space is defined consistently with
Sobolev and Bessel fractional ones: we consider the closure of smooth functions
under the natural norm obtained as the sum of the Lp norms of the function and
its nonlocal gradient. Among the results showed in this investigation we
highlight a nonlocal version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (namely, a
representation formula where a function can be recovered from its nonlocal
gradient), which allows us to prove inequalities in the spirit of Poincar\'e,
Morrey, Trudinger and Hardy as well as the corresponding compact embeddings.
These results are enough to show the existence of minimizers of general energy
functionals under the assumption of convexity. Equilibrium conditions in this
nonlocal situation are also established, and those can be viewed as a new class
of nonlocal partial differential equations in bounded domains.

RF array elements is required to maintain the integrity of the magnetic flux

be a prominent design method to circumvent these coupling issues. Yet, inherent
characteristics of these coils have ramification on the B1 field efficiency and
SNR. In this work, we propose a hairpin high impedance RF resonator design for
highly decoupled multichannel transceiver arrays at ultrahigh magnetic fields.
Due to the high impedance property of the hairpin resonators, the proposed
transceiver array can provide high decoupling performance without using any
dedicated decoupling circuit among the resonant elements. Because of
elimination of lumped inductors in the resonator circuit, higher B1 field
efficiency in imaging subjects can be expected. In order to validate the
feasibility of the proposed hairpin RF coils, systematical studies on
decoupling performance, field distribution, and SNR are performed, and the
results are compared with those obtained from existing high-impedance RF coil,
e.g., ""self-decoupled RF coil"". To further investigate its performance, an
8-channel head coil array using the proposed hairpin resonators loaded with a
cylindrical phantom is designed, demonstrating a 19 % increase of the B1+ field

characteristics of the hairpin RF coils are evaluated using a more realistic

excellent decoupling performance and superior RF magnetic field efficiency

explanation. When evaluating the explanation (i.e., subgraph importance), a
standard way is to audit the model prediction based on the subgraph solely.
However, we argue that a distribution shift exists between the full graph and

in-depth causal analysis, we find the OOD effect acts as the confounder, which
brings spurious associations between the subgraph importance and model
prediction, making the evaluation less reliable. In this work, we propose
Deconfounded Subgraph Evaluation (DSE) which assesses the causal effect of an

generally intractable, we employ the front-door adjustment and introduce a

adapted for the discrete energy spectra in the GEANT4 simulations. In our
multi-binned approach, we initially compute the discrete probabilities for each
energy bin, the number of which is flexible depending on the computational
goal, and we solely satisfy the imperative condition that requires the sum of
the discrete probabilities to be the unity. Regarding the implementation in
GEANT4, we construct a one-dimensional probability grid that consists of
sub-cells equaling the number of the energy bin, and each cell represents the
discrete probability of each energy bin by fulfilling the unity condition.
Through uniformly generating random numbers between 0 and 1, we assign the
discrete energy in accordance with the associated generated random number that
corresponds to a specific cell in the probability grid. This probabilistic
methodology does not only permits us to discretize the continuous energy
spectra based on the Monte Carlo generators, but it also gives a unique access
to utilize the experimental energy spectra measured at the distinct particle
flux values. Ergo, we initially perform our simulations by discretizing the
muon energy spectrum acquired via the CRY generator over the energy interval
between 0 and 8 GeV along with the measurements from the BESS spectrometer and
we determine the average scattering angle, the root-mean-square of the
scattering angle, and the number of the muon absorption by using a series of
slabs consisting of aluminum, copper, iron, lead, and uranium. Eventually, we
express a computational strategy in the GEANT4 simulations that grants us the
ability to verify as well as to modify the energy spectrum depending on the

but most exoplanet hosts lack UV observations. For cases in which the host UV
spectrum is unavailable, a reconstructed or proxy spectrum will need to be used

relations to understand how well reconstructed host star spectra reproduce
photochemically modeled atmospheres using real UV observations. We focus on two
cases; a modern Earth-like atmosphere and an Archean Earth-like atmosphere that
forms copious hydrocarbon hazes. We find that modern Earth-like environments
are well-reproduced with UV reconstructions, whereas hazy (Archean Earth)
atmospheres suffer from changes at the observable level. Specifically, both the
stellar UV emission lines and the UV continuum significantly influence the
chemical state and haze production in our modeled Archean atmospheres,
resulting in observable differences in their transmission spectra. Our modeling
results indicate that UV observations of individual exoplanet host stars are
needed to accurately characterize and predict the transmission spectra of hazy

Of particular importance is the in silico studies on the effect of electric

generic power-law dependence of the average dwell time at each pore. The
simulation protocols enable to monitor piecewise dynamics of the individual

capability to refine the accuracy of the experimentally obtained genomic

  Perspective",,,,,"physics.hist-ph hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Experiments in particle physics have hitherto failed to produce any
significant evidence for the many explicit models of physics beyond the
Standard Model (BSM) that had been proposed over the past decades. As a result,
physicists have increasingly turned to model-independent strategies as tools in
searching for a wide range of possible BSM effects. In this paper, we describe
the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SM-EFT) and analyse it in the
context of the philosophical discussions about models, theories, and
(bottom-up) effective field theories. We find that while the SM-EFT is a
quantum field theory, assisting experimentalists in searching for deviations
from the SM, in its general form it lacks some of the characteristic features
of models. Those features only come into play if put in by hand or prompted by
empirical evidence for deviations. Employing different philosophical approaches
to models, we argue that the case study suggests not to take a view on models
that is overly permissive because it blurs the lines between the different
stages of the SM-EFT research strategies and glosses over particle physicists'
motivations for undertaking this bottom-up approach in the first place. Looking
at EFTs from the perspective of modelling does not require taking a stance on
some specific brand of realism or taking sides in the debate between reduction
and emergence into which EFTs have recently been embedded.

communication systems, vehicles are expected to be equipped with massive
antenna arrays to realize beam-based links capable of compensating for the
severe path loss. However, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) direct links are prone to
be blocked by surrounding vehicles. Emerging metasurface technologies enable
the control of the electromagnetic wave reflection towards the desired
direction, enriching the channel scattering to boost communication performance.
Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and mostly the pre-configured
counterpart intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), are a promising low-cost
relaying system for 6G. This paper proposes using conformal metasurfaces
(either C-RIS or C-IRS) deployed on vehicles' body to mitigate the blockage
impact in a highway multi-lane scenario. In particular, conformal metasurfaces
create artificial reflections to mitigate blockage by compensating for the
non-flat shape of the vehicle's body, such as the lateral doors, with proper
phase patterns. We analytically derive the phase pattern to apply to a
cylindrical C-RIS/C-IRS approximating the shape of the car body, as a function
of both incidence and reflection angles, considering cylindrical RIS/IRS as a
generalization of conventional planar ones. We propose a novel design for
optimally pre-configured C-IRS to mimic the behavior of an EM flat surface on
car doors, proving the benefits of C-RIS and C-IRS in a multi-lane V2V highway
scenario. The results show a consistent reduction of blockage probability when
exploiting C-RIS/C-IRS, 20% for pre-configured C-IRS, and 70% for C-RIS, as
well as a remarkable improvement in terms of average signal-to-noise ratio,
respectively 10-20 dB for C-IRS and 30-40 dB for C-RIS.

population by pro-vax and no-vax factions. Starting from real-world data of

  The first one is a variation of the SIS model, where undecided position is
considered indifferent. Neutrals can be ""infected"" by one of the two extreme
factions, joining their side, and they ""recover"" when they lose interest in the
debate and go back to neutrality.
  The second model is a three parties Voters model: neutral pages represent a
centrist position. They lean their original ideas, that are different from both
the other parties.
  The last is the Bilingual model adapted to the vaccination debate: neutral
individuals are in agreement with both pro-, ad anti-vax factions, with a
position of compromise between the extremes (""bilingualism''). If they have a
one-sided neighbourhood, the convenience to agree with both parties comes out,
and bi-linguists can become mono-linguists.
  Our results depicts an agreement between the three models: anti-vax opinion
propagates more than pro-vax, thanks to an initial strategic position in the
online social network (even if they start with a smaller population). While
most of the pro-vaccines nodes are segregated in their own communities,
no-vaccines ones are entangled at the core of the network, where the majority
of undecided population is located.
  In the last section, we propose and compare some policies that could be
applied on the network to prevent anti-vax overcome: they lead us to conclude
that censoring strategies are not effective, as well as segregating scenarios
based on unfollowing decisions, while the addition of links in the network
favours the containment of the pro-vax domain, reducing the distance between
pro-vaxxers and undecided population.

climate policies that seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Policy
comparisons have often been performed by considering a planner who seeks to
make optimal trade-offs between the costs of carbon abatement and the economic
damages from climate change. The planning problem has been formalized as one of
optimal control, the objective being to minimize the total costs of abatement
and damages over a time horizon. Studying climate policy as a control problem
presumes that a planner knows enough to make optimization feasible, but
physical and economic uncertainties abound. Earlier, Manski, Sanstad, and
DeCanio proposed and studied use of the minimax-regret (MMR) decision criterion
to account for deep uncertainty in climate modeling. Here we study choice of
climate policy that minimizes maximum regret with deep uncertainty regarding
both the correct climate model and the appropriate time discount rate to use in
intergenerational assessment of policy consequences. The analysis specifies a
range of discount rates to express both empirical and normative uncertainty
about the appropriate rate. The findings regarding climate policy are novel and
informative. The MMR analysis points to use of a relatively low discount rate
of 0.02 for climate policy. The MMR decision rule keeps the maximum future

exploiting the non-uniform value distribution in deep learning applications.
APack can be used to increase the effective memory capacity, to reduce off-chip

smaller off-chip memories. APack builds upon arithmetic coding, encoding each
value as an arithmetically coded variable length prefix, plus an offset. To
maximize compression ratio a heuristic software algorithm partitions the value
space into groups each sharing a common prefix. APack exploits memory access
parallelism by using several, pipelined encoder/decoder units in parallel and
keeps up with the high data bandwidth demands of deep learning. APack can be
used with any machine learning accelerator. In the demonstrated configuration,
APack is placed just before the off-chip memory controller so that he rest of
the on-chip memory and compute units thus see the original data stream. We
implemented the APack compressor and decompressor in Verilog and in a 65nm tech
node demonstrating its performance and energy efficiency. Indicatively, APack
reduces data footprint of weights and activations to 60% and 48% respectively
on average over a wide set of 8-bit quantized models. It naturally adapts and
compresses models that use even more aggressive quantization methods. When
integrated with a Tensorcore-based accelerator, APack boosts the speedup and

interpretable feature effect. However, for non-linear models and especially
generalized linear models, the estimated coefficients cannot be interpreted as
a direct feature effect on the predicted outcome. Hence, marginal effects are
typically used as approximations for feature effects, either in the shape of
derivatives of the prediction function or forward differences in prediction due
to a change in a feature value. While marginal effects are commonly used in
many scientific fields, they have not yet been adopted as a model-agnostic
interpretation method for machine learning models. This may stem from their
inflexibility as a univariate feature effect and their inability to deal with
the non-linearities found in black box models. We introduce a new class of
marginal effects termed forward marginal effects. We argue to abandon
derivatives in favor of better-interpretable forward differences. Furthermore,
we generalize marginal effects based on forward differences to multivariate
changes in feature values. To account for the non-linearity of prediction
functions, we introduce a non-linearity measure for marginal effects. We argue
against summarizing feature effects of a non-linear prediction function in a
single metric such as the average marginal effect. Instead, we propose to
partition the feature space to compute conditional average marginal effects on
feature subspaces, which serve as conditional feature effect estimates.

habitability, resonant relation, and multiplicity) and hence has attracted
considerable attention. The mass distribution of the TRAPPIST-1 planets is
characterized by two features: the two inner planets are large, and the masses
of the four planets in the outer orbit increase with orbital distance. The
origin of these features cannot be explained by previous formation models. We
investigate whether the mass distribution of the TRAPPIST-1 system can be
reproduced by a planet formation model using N-body simulations. We used a gas
disk evolution model around a low-mass star constructed by considering disk
winds and followed the growth and orbital migration from planetary embryos with
the isolation mass, which increases with orbital distance. As a result, we find
that from the initial phase, planets in inner orbits undergo rapid orbital
migration, and the coalescence growth near the inner disk edge is enhanced.
This allows the inner planets to grow larger. Meanwhile, compared with the
inner planets, planets in outer orbits migrate more slowly and do not
frequently collide with neighboring planets. Therefore, the trend of increasing
mass toward the outer orbit, called reversed mass ranking, is maintained. The
final mass distribution approximately agrees with the two features of the mass
distribution in the TRAPPIST-1 system. We discover that the mass distribution
in the TRAPPIST-1 system can be reproduced when embryos experience rapid
migration and become trapped near the disk inner edge, and then more massive
embryos undergo slower migration. This migration transition can be achieved
naturally in a disk evolution model with disk winds.

characterized by initial density fluctuations drawn from a non-Gaussian
probability density function, rather than by construction of a particular form
for the primordial bispectrum. We numerically generate multiple realisations of
cosmological structure and use the late-time matter power spectrum, bispectrum

We show that the initial non-Gaussianity has only a small imprint on the first
three polyspectra, when compared to a standard Gaussian cosmology. Furthermore,
some of our models present an interesting scale-dependent deviation from the
Gaussian case in the bispectrum and trispectrum, although the signal is at most
at the percent level. The majority of our models are consistent with CMB

evolution of massive galaxies -- from rotationally-supported discs to
dispersion-dominated spheroids -- is largely explained via galaxy merging.
However, since mergers are likely to destroy discs, and the most massive
galaxies have the richest merger histories, it is surprising that any discs
exist at all at the highest stellar masses. Recent theoretical work by our
group has used a cosmological, hydrodynamical simulation to suggest that
extremely massive (M* > 10^11.4 MSun) discs form primarily via minor mergers
between spheroids and gas-rich satellites, which create new rotational stellar
components and leave discs as remnants. Here, we use UV-optical and HI data of
massive galaxies, from the SDSS, GALEX, DECaLS and ALFALFA surveys, to test
these theoretical predictions. Observed massive discs account for ~13% of
massive galaxies, in good agreement with theory (~11%). ~64% of the observed
massive discs exhibit tidal features, which are likely to indicate recent minor
mergers, in the deep DECaLS images (compared to ~60% in their simulated
counterparts). The incidence of these features is at least four times higher
than in low-mass discs, suggesting that, as predicted, minor mergers play a
significant (and outsized) role in the formation of these systems. The
empirical star-formation rates agree well with theoretical predictions and, for
a small galaxy sample with HI detections, the HI masses and fractions are
consistent with the range predicted by the simulation. The good agreement
between theory and observations indicates that extremely massive discs are
indeed remnants of recent minor mergers between spheroids and gas-rich
satellites.

necessary for reasoning. While knowledge graphs (KG) are often used to augment

work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations from
pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality
interaction operations. Information from both modalities propagates to the
other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured
world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in
the context to inform the graph representations of knowledge. Our results on

GreaseLM can more reliably answer questions that require reasoning over both

attractive approach is to create multiple cores, computing regions of fixed
size that are well-spaced but interlinked with communication channels. This
exploded architecture can relax the demands associated with a single monolithic
device: the complexity of control, cooling and power infrastructure as well as
the difficulties of cross-talk suppression and near-perfect component yield.
Here we explore interlinked multicore architectures through analytic and
numerical modelling. While elements of our analysis are relevant to diverse
platforms, our focus is on semiconductor electron spin systems in which
numerous cores may exist on a single chip. We model shuttling and
microwave-based interlinks and estimate the achievable fidelities, finding
values that are encouraging but markedly inferior to intra-core operations. We
therefore introduce optimsed entanglement purification to enable high-fidelity
communication, finding that $99.5\%$ is a very realistic goal. We then assess
the prospects for quantum advantage using such devices in the NISQ-era and
beyond: we simulate recently proposed exponentially-powerful error mitigation
schemes in the multicore environment and conclude that these techniques
impressively suppress imperfections in both the inter- and intra-core
operations.

1.45$^{+1.89}_{-0.85}$$\times$10$^9$M$_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH)
with a bolometric luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and an
Eddington ratio equal to 0.44$^{+0.78}_{-0.35}$. We also obtained new
photometric observations with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo in J and K bands
to better constrain the NIR Spectral Energy Distribution of the source. Thanks
to these observations, we were able to model the accretion disk and to derive
an independent estimate of the black hole mass of PSO J0309+27, confirming the
value inferred from the virial technique. The existence of such a massive SMBH
just $\sim$900 million years after the Big Bang challenges models of the
earliest SMBH growth, especially if jetted Active Galactic Nuclei are
associated to a highly spinning black hole as currently thought. Indeed, in a
Eddington-limited accretion scenario and assuming a radiative efficiency of
0.3, typical of a fast rotating SMBH, a seed black hole of more than 10$^6$
M$_{\odot}$ at z = 30 is required to reproduce the mass of PSO J0309+27 at
redshift 6. This requirement suggests either earlier periods of rapid black
hole growth with super-Eddington accretion and/or that only part of the
released gravitational energy goes to heat the accretion disk and feed the
black hole.

problem in which customer demands are known in distribution at the route
planning stage and revealed during route execution upon arrival at each
customer. A long-standing open question on the VRPSD concerns the benefits of
allowing, during route execution, partial reordering of the planned customer
visits. Given the practical importance of this question and the growing
interest on the VRPSD under optimal restocking, we study the VRPSD under a
recourse policy known as the switch policy. The switch policy is a canonical
reoptimization policy that permits only pairs of successive customers to be
reordered. We consider this policy jointly with optimal preventive restocking
and introduce a branch-cut-and-price algorithm to compute optimal a priori
routing plans. This algorithm features pricing routines where value functions
represent the expected cost-to-go along planned routes for all possible states
and reordering decisions. To ensure pricing tractability, we adopt a strategy
that combines elementary pricing with completion bounds of varying complexity,
and solve the pricing problem without relying on dominance rules. Our numerical
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for solving
instances with up to 50 customers. Notably, they also give us new insights into
the value of reoptimization. The switch policy enables significant cost savings
over optimal restocking when the planned routes come from an algorithm built on
a deterministic approximation of the data, an important scenario given the
difficulty of finding optimal VRPSD solutions. The benefits are smaller when
comparing optimal a priori VRPSD solutions obtained for both recourse policies.
As it appears, further cost savings may require joint reordering and
reassignment of customer visits among vehicles when the context permits.

revealed the presence of multiple, varied substructures in their dust and gas

Aurigae bears an emblematic (pre)transitional disk showing spiral structures
observed in the inner cavity of the disk in both the sub-millimeter (ALMA;
1.3mm, $^{12}$CO) and near-infrared (SPHERE; 1.5-2.5$\mu$m) wavelengths which
have been claimed to arise from dynamical interactions with a massive

extended disk structures. No point source is recovered, in particular at the
outer regions of the disk, where a putative candidate ($\rho = 0.681"", PA =
7.6^{\circ}$) had been previously claimed. The nature of a second innermost
planet candidate ($\rho = 0.16'', PA = 203.9^{\circ}$) can not be investigated

polarimetric H-band observations. We also recover the ring structure of the
system at larger separation (0.5-0.7"") showing a clear south-east/north-west

PSF subtraction, we detect the disk at high signal to noise in all three bands.
We find strong morphological differences between bands, including asymmetries
consistent with observed spiral arms within 100 AU in L'. An apparent deficit
of scattered light at 3.08 ${\mu}$m relative to bracketing wavelengths (Ks and
L') is evocative of ice absorption at the disk surface layer. However, the
${\Delta}$(Ks-H2O) color is consistent with grains with little to no ice (0-5%
by mass). The ${\Delta}$(H2O-L') color, conversely, suggests grains with a much
higher ice mass fraction (~0.68), and the two colors cannot be reconciled under
a single grain population model. Additionally, we find the extremely red
${\Delta}$(Ks-L') disk color cannot be reproduced under conventional scattered
light modeling with any combination of grain parameters or reasonable local
extinction values. We hypothesize that the scattering surfaces at the three
wavelengths are not co-located, and optical depth effects result in each
wavelength probing the grain population at different disk surface depths. The
morphological similarity between Ks and H2O suggests their scattering surfaces
are near one another, lending credence to the ${\Delta}$(Ks-H2O) disk color
constraint of < 5% ice mass fraction for the outermost scattering disk layer.

(DFIG) architecture for providing ride-through result in limited control of the
turbine shaft and grid current during fault events. A DFIG architecture in
which the grid side converter is connected in series as opposed to parallel
with the grid connection has shown improved low voltage ride through but poor
power processing capabilities. In this paper a unified DFIG wind turbine
architecture which employs a parallel grid side rectifier and series grid side
converter is presented. The combination of these two converters enables
unencumbered power processing and improved voltage disturbance ride through. A
dynamic model and control structure for this unified architecture is developed.
The operation of the system is illustrated using computer simulations.

However, the next generation X-ray telescopic experiments propose for
significantly larger collecting area compared to the existing observatories in

requires these detectors to have an order of magnitude faster readout. In this
context, the Stanford University (SU) in collaboration with the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) has initiated the development of fast readout
electronics for X-ray CCDs. At SU, we have designed and developed a fast and

Mpixel/s. We successfully ran a prototype CCD matrix of 512 $\times$ 512 pixels
at 4 Mpixels/s. In this paper, we describe the details of the readout

continue to improve performance of the readout module and eventually converge

Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171, 193, 211, and 304 Ang images. In SXRs
we track the lateral drift of the jet spire relative to the jet base's jet
bright point (JBP). In 22 of 23 jets the spire either moves away from (18
cases) or is stationary relative to (4 cases) the JBP. The one exception where
the spire moved toward the JBP may be a consequence of line-of-sight projection
effects at the limb. From the AIA images, we clearly identify an erupting
minifilament in 20 of the 23 jets, while the remainder are consistent with such
an eruption having taken place. We also confirm that some jets can trigger
onset of nearby ""sympathetic"" jets, likely because eruption of the minifilament
field of the first jet removes magnetic constraints on the base-field region of
the second jet. The propensity for spire drift away from the JBP, the
identification of the erupting minifilament in the majority of jets, and the
magnetic-field topological changes that lead to sympathetic jets, all support

for guiding cardiac electrophysiology and structural heart interventions. ICE
provides real-time observation of anatomy and devices, while enabling direct
monitoring of potential complications. In single operator settings, the
physician needs to switch back-and-forth between the ICE catheter and therapy
device, making continuous ICE support impossible. Two operators setup are
therefore sometimes implemented, with the challenge of increase room occupation
and cost. Two operator setups are sometimes implemented, but increase
procedural costs and room occupation.
  Methods: ICE catheter robotic control system is developed with automated
catheter tip repositioning (i.e. view recovery) method, which can reproduce
important views previously navigated to and saved by the user. The performance
of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated in a combination of heart
phantom and animal experiments.
  Results: Automated ICE view recovery achieved catheter tip position accuracy
of 2.09 +/-0.90 mm and catheter image orientation accuracy of 3.93 +/- 2.07
degree in animal studies, and 0.67 +/- 0.79 mm and 0.37 +/- 0.19 degree in
heart phantom studies, respectively. Our proposed method is also successfully
used during transeptal puncture in animals without complications, showing the
possibility for fluoro-less transeptal puncture with ICE catheter robot.
  Conclusion: Robotic ICE imaging has the potential to provide precise and
reproducible anatomical views, which can reduce overall execution time, labor
burden of procedures, and x-ray usage for a range of cardiac procedures.

magnitude using the energies of gamma rays. The previous tentative Jpi values
have been confirmed. Decays from high-spin states in 131Sn have been observed
following transfer on the isomeric component of the 130Sn beam. The improved
energies and confirmed spin-parities of the p-wave states important to the

both the sound velocity or slowness and source wavelet with specified support,
so that the data is fit with prescribed RMS relative error. The least-squares
objective function has multiple large residual minimizers. The extended inverse
problem permits source energy to spread in time, and replaces the maximum lag

concluded that for the actual experimental measurement of the AC losses at the

series of compositional tasks tailored to the RL agent's current skill level.
This automatic curriculum not only enables the agent to learn more complex
tasks than it could have otherwise, but also selects tasks where the agent's
performance is weak, enhancing its robustness and ability to generalize
zero-shot to unseen tasks at test-time. We analyze why current environment
generation techniques are insufficient for the problem of generating
compositional tasks, and propose a new algorithm that addresses these issues.
Our results assess learning and generalization across multiple compositional
tasks, including the real-world problem of learning to navigate and interact

those environments. We contribute two new benchmark frameworks for generating

$(1+\epsilon)$-approximations to a discrete median line segment in time
$O(n\epsilon^{-2d}\log n)$ and $O(n^2\epsilon^{-d})$, respectively, where
$\Delta$ is the spread of line segments spanned by pairs of points. While
developing our algorithms, by using the principle of pair decomposition, we
derive new data structures that allow us to quickly approximate the sum of the

  We prove that it is impossible to construct a continuous median line segment

In view of this, we present an $O(n^d\epsilon^{-d})$-time algorithm for
approximating a continuous median line segment in $\mathbb{R}^d$ within a
factor of $1+\epsilon$. The algorithm is based upon generalizing the
point-segment pair decomposition from the discrete to the continuous domain.

resources to classical sensing approaches with the goal of enhancing the
precision in the estimation of a parameter beyond what can be achieved with
classical resources. Theoretically, the fundamental minimum uncertainty in the
estimation of a parameter for a given probing state is bounded by the quantum
Cram\'er-Rao bound. From a practical perspective, it is necessary to find
physical measurements that can saturate this fundamental limit and to show
experimentally that it is possible to perform measurements with the required
precision to do so. Here we perform experiments that saturate the quantum
Cram\'er-Rao bound for transmission estimation over a wide range of
transmissions when probing the system under study with a bright two-mode
squeezed state. To properly take into account the imperfections in the
generation of the quantum state, we extend our previous theoretical results to
incorporate the measured properties of the generated quantum state. For our
largest transmission level of 84%, we show a 62% reduction over the optimal
classical protocol in the variance in transmission estimation when probing with
a bright two-mode squeezed state with 8 dB of intensity-difference squeezing.
Given that transmission estimation is an integral part of many sensing
protocols, such as plasmonic sensing, spectroscopy, calibration of the quantum
efficiency of detectors, etc., the results presented promise to have a
significant impact on a number of applications in various fields of research.

rule is said to be optimistically universal if it achieves a low long-run
average loss whenever the data generating process makes this goal achievable by
some learning rule. Hanneke posed as an open problem whether, for every

precisely those having a finite number of distinct values almost surely. In
this paper, we completely resolve this problem, showing that this is indeed the

an optimistically universal learning rule for any unbounded loss: namely, the
simple memorization rule already suffices. Our proof relies on constructing
random measurable partitions of the instance space and could be of independent

maximization problem is natural: the problem is first solved with the bids of
the most senior pilot; then it is solved with those of the second most senior
without decreasing the score of the most senior, and so on. The literature
admits that the structure of the problem somehow imposes such an approach. The
problem can be modeled as an integer linear lexicographic program. We propose a
new exact method, which relies on column generation for solving its continuous

lexicographic programs admit ""primal-dual"" feasible bases and we show how to

resource-constrained longest path problem. Numerical experiments show that this
new method is already able to solve industrial instances provided by Air
France, with up to 150 pilots. By adding a last ingredient in the resolution of
the longest path problems, which exploits the specificity of the preferential

developed in the literature to efficiently solve steady state solutions of
hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). As other types of fast
sweeping schemes, fixed-point fast sweeping methods use the Gauss-Seidel
iterations and alternating sweeping strategy to cover characteristics of
hyperbolic PDEs in a certain direction simultaneously in each sweeping order.
The resulting iterative schemes have fast convergence rate to steady state
solutions. Moreover, an advantage of fixed-point fast sweeping methods over
other types of fast sweeping methods is that they are explicit and do not
involve inverse operation of any nonlinear local system. Hence they are robust
and flexible, and have been combined with high order accurate weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes to solve various hyperbolic PDEs in
the literature. For multidimensional nonlinear problems, high order fixed-point
fast sweeping WENO methods still require quite large amount of computational
costs. In this technical note, we apply sparse-grid techniques, an effective
approximation tool for multidimensional problems, to fixed-point fast sweeping
WENO method for reducing its computational costs. Here we focus on a robust
Runge-Kutta (RK) type fixed-point fast sweeping WENO scheme with third order
accuracy (Zhang et al. 2006 [33]), for solving Eikonal equations, an important
class of static Hamilton-Jacobi (H-J) equations. Numerical experiments on
solving multidimensional Eikonal equations and a more general static H-J
equation are performed to show that the sparse grid computations of the
fixed-point fast sweeping WENO scheme achieve large savings of CPU times on
refined meshes, and at the same time maintain comparable accuracy and
resolution with those on corresponding regular single grids.

spin-orbit coupling leads to ubiquitous entanglement of spin and orbital
quantum numbers, along with notable mixing between even- and odd-frequency
correlations. We propose a phase diagram obtained from the temperature
dependence of the leading and subleading symmetries in the pseudospin-orbital
basis. An accidental degeneracy between leading inter-pseudospin symmetries in
strontium ruthenate, B$_{1g}^+$ and A$_{2g}^-$, could resolve apparent
experimental contradictions.

abstraction becomes one of the key issues of learning with deep neural

both explicit and implicit hierarchical information in modeling languages in
the literature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the latent
indicator layer to identify and learn implicit hierarchical information (e.g.,
phrases), and further develop an EM algorithm to handle the latent indicator
layer in training. The latent indicator layer further simplifies a text's
hierarchical structure, which allows us to seamlessly integrate different
levels of attention mechanisms into the structure. We called the resulting
architecture as the EM-HRNN model. Furthermore, we develop two bootstrap
strategies to effectively and efficiently train the EM-HRNN model on long text

EM-HRNN model with bootstrap training outperforms other RNN-based models in
document classification tasks. The performance of the EM-HRNN model is
comparable to a Transformer-based method called Bert-base, though the former is
much smaller model and does not require pre-training.

They were synthesized by a multi-step seed mediated growth approach. Although
TEM micrographs clearly show the growth of each shell from the iron oxide core,
core sizes and shell thicknesses markedly differ from what is suggested by the
size increase. We investigated very precisely the structure of NPs in
performing high resolution (scanning) TEM imaging and GPA. The chemical
composition and spatial distribution of atoms were studied by EELS. The
chemical environment and oxidation state of cations were investigated by
M\""ossbauer spectrometry, soft XAS and XMCD. These techniques allowed us to
estimate the increase of Fe2+ content in the iron oxide core of the core@shell

core@shell@shell one, while the iron oxide shell appears to be much thinner
than expected. Thus, the modification of the chemical composition as well as
the size of the Fe(3-delta)O4 core and the thickness of the cobalt ferrite

multiple access (OFDMA) systems, synchronization errors such as carrier
frequency offsets (CFOs) can significantly degrade the channel estimation
performance. This becomes more critical in RIS-aided communications, as even a
small channel estimation error leads to a significant performance loss.
Motivated by this, we propose a joint CFO and channel estimation method for
RIS-aided multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Our
proposed pilot structure allows accurate estimation of the CFOs without
multi-user interference (MUI), using the same pilot resources for both CFO
estimation and channel estimation. For joint estimation of multiple users'
CFOs, a correlation-based approach is devised using the received signals at all
BS antennas. Using least-squares (LS) estimation with the obtained CFO values,
the channels of all users are jointly estimated. For optimization of the RIS
phase shifts at the data transmission stage, we propose a projected gradient
method (PGM). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method provides
an improvement in the normalized mean-square error (NMSE) of channel estimation
as well as in the bit error rate (BER) performance.

frequency and phase consensus (DFPC) algorithm is proposed which uses an
average consensus method in which each node in the array iteratively updates
its frequency and phase by computing an average of the frequencies and phases
of their neighboring nodes. Simulation results show that upon convergence the
DFPC algorithm can align the frequencies and phases of all the nodes up to a
residual phase error that is governed by the oscillators and the estimation
errors. To reduce this residual phase error and thus improve the
synchronization between the nodes, a Kalman filter based decentralized
frequency and phase consensus (KF-DFPC) algorithm is presented. The total
residual phase error at the convergence of the KF-DFPC and DFPC algorithms is
derived theoretically. The synchronization performances of these algorithms are
compared to each other in light of this theoretical residual phase error by
varying the duration of the signals, connectivity of the nodes, the number of
nodes in the array, and signal to noise ratio of the transmitted signals.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed KF-DFPC algorithm converges in
fewer iterations than other algorithms including DFPC. Furthermore, for shorter

adversarial networks (GAN) has achieved great progress. GAN-based
classification methods can mitigate the limited training sample dilemma to some
extent. However, several studies have pointed out that existing GAN-based HSI
classification methods are heavily affected by the imbalanced training data
problem. The discriminator in GAN always contradicts itself and tries to
associate fake labels to the minority-class samples, and thus impair the
classification performance. Another critical issue is the mode collapse in
GAN-based methods. The generator is only capable of producing samples within a
narrow scope of the data space, which severely hinders the advancement of
GAN-based HSI classification methods. In this paper, we proposed an Adaptive
DropBlock-enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks (ADGAN) for HSI
classification. First, to solve the imbalanced training data problem, we adjust
the discriminator to be a single classifier, and it will not contradict itself.
Second, an adaptive DropBlock (AdapDrop) is proposed as a regularization method
employed in the generator and discriminator to alleviate the mode collapse
issue. The AdapDrop generated drop masks with adaptive shapes instead of a
fixed size region, and it alleviates the limitations of DropBlock in dealing
with ground objects with various shapes. Experimental results on three HSI
datasets demonstrated that the proposed ADGAN achieved superior performance
over state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. Our codes are available at

damping ratio ($\xi$), a characteristic perturbation timescale
($\tau_{\mathrm{perturb}}$), and an amplitude for the perturbing white noise

different dependencies with rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$) on

formulated under a competing risks model where the endpoint is virologically
confirmed COVID-19 and the cause-of-failure is the infecting SARS-CoV-2

ratio (vaccine/placebo). For the COVID-19 VE trials, the time to COVID-19 is
right-censored, and a substantial percentage of failure cases are missing the
infecting virus genotype. We develop estimation and hypothesis testing
procedures for strain-specific VE when the failure time is subject to right
censoring and the cause-of-failure is subject to missingness, focusing on $J
\ge 2$ discrete categorical unordered or ordered virus genotypes. The
stratified Cox proportional hazards model is used to relate the cause-specific
outcomes to explanatory variables. The inverse probability weighted
complete-case (IPW) estimator and the augmented inverse probability weighted
complete-case (AIPW) estimator are investigated. Hypothesis tests are developed
to assess whether the vaccine provides at least a specified level of efficacy
against some viral genotypes and whether VE varies across genotypes, adjusting
for covariates. The finite-sample properties of the proposed tests are studied
through simulations and are shown to have good performances. In preparation for
the real data analyses, the developed methods are applied to a pseudo dataset

information for medical image analysis. However, acquiring all modalities among
all institutes is costly and often impossible in clinical settings. To leverage
more comprehensive multi-modality information, we propose a privacy secured
decentralized multi-modality adaptive learning architecture named ModalityBank.
Our method could learn a set of effective domain-specific modulation parameters
plugged into a common domain-agnostic network. We demonstrate by switching
different sets of configurations, the generator could output high-quality
images for a specific modality. Our method could also complete the missing
modalities across all data centers, thus could be used for modality completion
purposes. The downstream task trained from the synthesized multi-modality
samples could achieve higher performance than learning from one real data
center and achieve close-to-real performance compare with all real images.

mathematically rigorous and differing subtly in the details -- have appeared in
the literature. In this paper, we revisit these definitions, make them
rigorous, and critically examine their similarities and differences. Our
technical tools derive from optimal transport, robust statistics, functional
analysis, and game theory. Our contributions include the following:
generalizing Strassen's theorem to the unbalanced optimal transport setting
with applications to adversarial classification with unequal priors; showing an
equivalence between adversarial robustness and robust hypothesis testing with
$\infty$-Wasserstein uncertainty sets; proving the existence of a pure Nash
equilibrium in the two-player game between the adversary and the algorithm; and
characterizing adversarial risk by the minimum Bayes error between a pair of
distributions belonging to the $\infty$-Wasserstein uncertainty sets. Our
results generalize and deepen recently discovered connections between optimal
transport and adversarial robustness and reveal new connections to Choquet

small target chips and large-scene images, an integrated YOLO network combining
non-maximum suppression on sub-images is used to realize multiple targets

number of exemplar objects (i.e., described by one or several support images)
occurring in the query image. The major challenge lies in that the target
objects can be densely packed in the query image, making it hard to recognize
every single one. To tackle the obstacle, we propose a novel learning block,
equipped with a similarity comparison module and a feature enhancement module.
Concretely, given a support image and a query image, we first derive a score
map by comparing their projected features at every spatial position. The score
maps regarding all support images are collected together and normalized across
both the exemplar dimension and the spatial dimensions, producing a reliable
similarity map. We then enhance the query feature with the support features by
employing the developed point-wise similarities as the weighting coefficients.
Such a design encourages the model to inspect the query image by focusing more
on the regions akin to the support images, leading to much clearer boundaries
between different objects. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and
training setups suggest that we surpass the state-of-the-art methods by a
sufficiently large margin. For instance, on a recent large-scale FSC-147
dataset, we surpass the state-of-the-art method by improving the mean absolute
error from 22.08 to 14.32 (35%$\uparrow$). Code has been released in

to effectively model these nonlinear variational information and learn
invariant representations is an open challenge in the community of computer

handle this problem. Firstly, the second-order statistic, i.e., covariance
matrix is applied to model the original image sets. Due to the space formed by
a set of nonsingular covariance matrices is a well-known Symmetric Positive
Definite (SPD) manifold, generalising the Euclidean collaborative
representation to the SPD manifold is not an easy task. Then, we devise two
strategies to cope with this issue. One attempts to embed the SPD
manifold-valued data representations into an associated tangent space via the
matrix logarithm map. Another is to embed them into a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) by utilizing the Riemannian kernel function. After these
two treatments, CRC is applicable to the SPD manifold-valued features. The
evaluations on four banchmarking datasets justify its effectiveness.

achieved an accuracy of 96.17% on the testing set. To further validate the
accuracy of the model, we selected 835 Hot subdwarfs that were not involved in

propose FALCON, a learning-based multipath scheduler that can adapt fast and
accurately to time-varying network conditions. FALCON builds on the idea of
meta-learning where offline learning is used to create a set of meta-models
that represent coarse-grained network conditions, and online learning is used
to bootstrap a specific model for the current fine-grained network conditions
towards deriving the scheduling policy to deal with such conditions. Using
trace-driven emulation experiments, we demonstrate FALCON outperforms the best

bounding-boxes and top-1 scores returned by the attacked model. Compared with
black-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in
black-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is
successfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near
the attacked bounding-box. Secondly, there are multiple bounding-boxes, leading
to very high attack cost. To address these challenges, we propose a Parallel
Rectangle Flip Attack (PRFA) via random search. We explain the difference
between our method with other attacks in Fig.~\ref{fig1}. Specifically, we
generate perturbations in each rectangle patch to avoid sub-optimal detection
near the attacked region. Besides, utilizing the observation that adversarial
perturbations mainly locate around objects' contours and critical points under
white-box attacks, the search space of attacked rectangles is reduced to
improve the attack efficiency. Moreover, we develop a parallel mechanism of
attacking multiple rectangles simultaneously to further accelerate the attack
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively and

type of physical mechanisms which can easen the effects of magnetic braking
during collapse of cloud cores leading to formation of protostellar disks.
However, its essential factors are poorly understood. Therefore, we perform a
more detailed analysis of the physics involved. We analyze existing simulation
data to measure the system torques, mass accretion rates and Toomre Q
parameters. We also examine the presence of shocks in the system. While
advective torques are generally the strongest, we find that magnetic and
gravitational torques can play substantial roles in how angular momentum is
transferred during the disk formation process. Magnetic torques can shape the
accretion flows, creating two-armed magnetized inflow spirals aligned with the
magnetic field. We find evidence of an accretion shock that is aligned
according to the spiral structure of the system. Inclusion of ambipolar
diffusion as explored in this work has shown a slight influence in the small

systems where some of these phenomena could be present.

In this work, we propose the first low polynomial-time algorithm for MRPP
achieving 1--1.5 asymptotic optimality guarantees on makespan for random
instances under very high robot density, with high probability. The dual
guarantee on computational efficiency and solution optimality suggests our
proposed general method is promising in significantly scaling up multi-robot
applications for logistics, e.g., at large robotic warehouses.
  Specifically, on an $m_1\times m_2$ gird, $m_1 \ge m_2$, our RTH (Rubik Table
with Highways) algorithm computes solutions for routing up to
$\frac{m_1m_2}{3}$ robots with uniformly randomly distributed start and goal
configurations with a makespan of $m_1 + 2m_2 + o(m_1)$, with high probability.
Because the minimum makespan for such instances is $m_1 + m_2 - o(m_1)$, also
with high probability, RTH guarantees $\frac{m_1+2m_2}{m_1+m_2}$ optimality as
$m_1 \to \infty$ for random instances with up to $\frac{1}{3}$ robot density,
with high probability. $\frac{m_1+2m_2}{m_1+m_2} \in (1, 1.5]$. Alongside this
key result, we also establish a series of related results supporting even
higher robot densities and environments with regularly distributed obstacles,
which directly map to real-world parcel sorting scenarios. Building on the
baseline methods with provable guarantees, we have developed effective,
principled heuristics that further improve the computed optimality of the RTH
algorithms. In extensive numerical evaluations, RTH and its variants
demonstrate exceptional scalability as compared with methods including ECBS and
DDM, scaling to over $450 \times 300$ grids with $45,000$ robots, and
consistently achieves makespan around $1.5$ optimal or better, as predicted by

strategy embedded in inverse procedural modeling. Beginning with textured LOD-2
(Level-of-Details) models, we use the classical convolutional neural networks
to recognize the types and estimate the parameters of windows from image

from a few labeled samples, we leverage the generative adversarial network to
train the feature extractor in a semi-supervised manner. The adversarial
training strategy can also exploit unlabeled data to make the training phase
more stable. Experiments using publicly available fa\c{c}ade image datasets
reveal that the proposed training strategy can obtain about 10% improvement in

for processes like chemical extraction, chromatography or emulsification. In
this work we look at the dissolution of a pair of vertically aligned droplets
immersed in water, both experimentally and with numerical simulations. The
liquids used for the droplets are long chain alcohols with a low but finite
solubility in water and a significantly lower density than that of the host
liquid. Therefore, a solutal plume is formed above of the bottom droplet and
natural convection dominates the dissolution process. We monitor the volume of
the droplets and the velocity field around them over time. When the liquids of
the two droplets are the same, our previously found scaling laws for the
Sherwood and Reynolds numbers as functions of the Rayleigh number (Dietrich et
al., 2016, J. Fluid Mech.) can be applied to the lower droplet. However,
remarkably, when the liquid of the top droplet is different than that of the
bottom droplet the volume as function of time becomes non-monotonic, and an
oscillatory Marangoni flow at the top droplet is observed. We identify the
competition between solutal Marangoni flow and density driven convection as the
origin of the oscillation, and numerically model the process.

of two homologous accelerated electron beams and a quasi-periodic

The jet occurred in a small-scale fan-spine magnetic system embedding in a
large-scale pseudostreamer, which associated with a GOES C1.4 flare, a jet-like
coronal mass ejection (CME), a type II radio burst, and a type III radio burst.
During the initial stage, a QFP wave train and a fast moving on-disk radio
source were detected in succession ahead of the jet along the outer spine of
the fan-spine system. When the jet reached a height of about 1.3 solar radii,
it underwent a bifurcation into two branches. Based on our analysis results,
all the observed phenomena in association with the jet can be explained by
using a fan-spine magnetic system. We propose that both the type III radio
burst and the on-disk fast moving radio source were caused by the same physical
process, i.e., the energetic electrons accelerated by the magnetic reconnection
at the null point, and they were along the open field lines of the
pseudostreamer and the closed outer spine of the fan-spine structure,
respectively. Due to the bifurcation of the jet body, the lower branch along
the closed outer spine of the fan-spine structure fell back to the solar
surface, while the upper branch along the open field lines of the
pseudostreamer caused the jet-like CME in the outer corona.

that has been recently proposed, as a generalization of graph signal processing
(GSP), aimed to analyze signals defined over sets of any order (i.e. not only
vertices of a graph) and to capture relations of any order present in the
observed data. Our goal in this paper is to extend the TSP framework to deal
with signals defined over cell complexes, i.e. topological spaces that are not
constrained to satisfy the inclusion property of simplicial complexes, namely
the condition that, if a set belongs to the complex, then all its subsets
belong to the complex as well. We start showing how to translate the algebraic
topological tools to deal with signals defined over cell complexes and then we
propose a method to infer the structure of the cell complex from data. Then, we
address the filtering problem over cell complexes and we provide the
theoretical conditions under which the independent filtering of the solenoidal
and irrotational components of edge signals brings a performance improvement
with respect to a common filtering strategy. Furthermore, we propose a
distributed strategy to filter the harmonic signals with the aim of retrieving
the sparsest representation of the harmonic components. Finally, we quantify
the advantages of using cell complexes instead of simplicial complexes, in
terms of the sparsity/accuracy trade-off and of the signal recovery accuracy
from sparse samples, using both simulated and real flows measured on data
traffic and transportation networks.

constraints, and are usually solved via utilizing the traditional optimization
methods that have high computational complexity and need to be executed
repeatedly with the change of network environments. In this paper, to overcome
these shortcomings, an unsupervised deep unrolling framework based on
projection gradient descent, i.e., unrolled PGD network (UPGDNet), is designed
to solve a family of constrained optimization problems. The set of constraints
is divided into two categories according to the coupling relations among
optimization variables and the convexity of constraints. One category of
constraints includes convex constraints with decoupling among optimization
variables, and the other category of constraints includes non-convex or convex
constraints with coupling among optimization variables. Then, the first
category of constraints is directly projected onto the feasible region, while
the second category of constraints is projected onto the feasible region using
neural network. Finally, an unrolled sum rate maximization network (USRMNet) is
designed based on UPGDNet to solve the weighted SR maximization problem for the
multiuser ultra-reliable low latency communication system. Numerical results
show that USRMNet has a comparable performance with low computational
complexity and an acceptable generalization ability in terms of the user
distribution.

various policy levers affecting fuel prices, car prices and fuel economy. This
study estimates the responsiveness of new car buyers in China and India to such
policy levers and drivers including income. Furthermore, we estimate the
potential for rebound effect and the effectiveness of a feebate policy. To
accomplish this, we developed a joint discrete-continuous model of car choice
and usage based on revealed preference survey data from approximately 8000 new
car buyers from India and China who purchased cars in 2016-17. Conditional on
buying a new car, the fuel consumption in both markets is found to be
relatively unresponsive to fuel price and income, with magnitudes of elasticity
estimates ranging from 0.12 to 0.15. For both markets, the mean segment-level
direct elasticities of fuel consumption relative to car price and fuel economy
range from 0.57 to 0.65. The rebound effect on fuel savings due to cost-free
fuel economy improvement is found to be 17.1% for India and 18.8% for China. A
revenue-neutral feebate policy, with average rebates and fees of up to around
15% of the retail price, resulted in fuel savings of around 0.7% for both
markets. While the feebate policy's rebound effect is low - 7.3% for India and
1.6% for China - it does not appear to be an effective fuel conservation

effective Newton's constant $G_{\rm eff}$ by about 10%, taking place 50-150
Myrs ago, can lead to the resolution of both the Hubble crisis and the growth
tension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Hints for such an abrupt transition
with weaker gravity at times before the transition, have recently been
identified in Tully Fisher galactic mass-velocity data and also in Cepheid SnIa
calibrator data. Here we use Monte-Carlo simulations to show that such a
transition could significantly increase (by a factor of 3 or more) the number
of long period comets (LPCs) impacting the solar system from the Oort cloud
(semi-major axis of orbits $\gtrsim 10^4AU$). This increase is consistent with
observational evidence from the terrestrial and lunar cratering rates
indicating that the impact flux of kilometer sized objects increased by at
least a factor of 2 over that last 100 Myrs compared to the long term average.
This increase may also be connected with the Chicxulub impactor event that
produced the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) extinction of 75% of life on Earth
(including dinosaurs) about 66 Myrs ago. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to show
that for isotropic Oort cloud comet distribution with initially circular
orbits, random velocity perturbations (induced eg by passing stars and/or
galactic tidal effects), lead to a deformation of the orbits that increases
significantly when $G_{\rm eff}$ increases. A 10% increase of $G_{\rm eff}$
leads to an increase in the probability of the comets to enter the loss cone
and reach the planetary region (pericenter of less than 10AU) by a factor that
ranges from 5% (for velocity perturbation much smaller than the comet initial
velocity) to more than 300% (for total velocity perturbations comparable with
the initial comet velocity).

matrices and vector measurements is studied. Starting from a storage function
on the Special Orthogonal Group $SO(3)$, a dissipation inequality is
considered, and a deterministic nonlinear $H_{\infty}$ filter is derived which
respects a given upper bound $\gamma$ on the energy gain from exogenous
disturbances and initial estimation errors to a generalized estimation error.
The results are valid for all estimation errors which correspond to an angular
error of less than $\pi/2$ radians in terms of the axis-angle representation.
The approach builds on earlier results on attitude estimation, in particular
nonlinear $H_{\infty}$ filtering using quaternions, and proposes a novel filter
developed directly on $SO(3)$. The proposed filter employs the same innovation
term as the Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF), as well as a matrix
gain updated in accordance with a Riccati-type gain update equation. However,
in contrast to the MEKF, the proposed filter has an additional tuning gain,
$\gamma$, which enables it to be more aggressive during transients. The filter
is simulated for different conditions, and the results are compared with those
obtained using the continuous-time quaternion MEKF and the Geometric
Approximate Minimum Energy (GAME) filter. Simulations indicate competitive
performance. In particular, the GAME filter has the best transient performance,
followed by the proposed $H_{\infty}$ filter and the quaternion MEKF. All three
filters have similar steady-state performance. Therefore, the proposed filter
can be seen as a MEKF variant which achieves better transient performance
without significant degradation in steady-state noise rejection.

all the reflecting elements are installed on a single RIS and (ii) the
distributed deployment, where the same number of reflecting elements are placed
on multiple RISs. For both deployment strategies, we derive accurate
closed-form approximations for the ergodic capacity, and we introduce tight
upper and lower bounds for the ergodic capacity to obtain useful design
insights. From this analysis, we unveil that an increase of the transmit power,
the Rician-K factor, the accuracy of the channel state information and the
number of reflecting elements help improve the system performance. Moreover, we
prove that the centralized RIS-aided deployment may achieve a higher ergodic
capacity as compared with the distributed RIS-aided deployment when the RIS is

other hand, we prove that the distributed deployment outperforms the
centralized deployment. Finally, the analytical results are verified by using

Whilst some studies have analyzed mHealth apps from different angles, including
security, there is relatively little evidence for data privacy issues that may
exist in mHealth apps used for mental health services, whose recipients can be
particularly vulnerable. This paper reports an empirical study aimed at
systematically identifying and understanding data privacy incorporated in

evaluation. Furthermore, we mapped the findings to the LINDDUN threat taxonomy,
describing how threats manifest on the studied apps. The findings reveal
important data privacy issues such as unnecessary permissions, insecure
cryptography implementations, and leaks of personal data and credentials in
logs and web requests. There is also a high risk of user profiling as the apps'
development do not provide foolproof mechanisms against linkability,
detectability and identifiability. Data sharing among third parties and

are fully renormalized in the standard procedure, while the infrared (IR)

essentially indicate the quark mass effect, in spite of the absence of real

  Poiseuille flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Based on the properties of large-scale plume currents, an injection/suction
control strategy is introduced to enhance the strength of plume currents and
the turbulent transport of passive scalar in rotating plane Poiseuille flow.
The control keeps the classical non-penetrative condition on the stable side,
and prescribes spanwise varying wall-normal velocity on the unstable side.
Direct numerical simulations show that at medium rotation numbers, very weak
injection/suction (the root-mean-square velocity on the controlled side is
below $1\%$ of the bulk mean velocity) with properly distributed slots could
significantly enhance the large-scale plume currents which have the same
spatial distribution as the injection slots. In addition, if the distance
between plume currents are increased, the turbulent transport efficiency can be
promoted. Therefore, taking the strength and transport efficiency into account,
the distance between injection slots should be slightly larger than the
intrinsic distance between plume currents to achieve maximum enhancement of
turbulent transport. For comparison, the control with non-penetrative condition
on the unstable side and injection/suction on the stable side is also examined
with simulations. It is found that the injection/suction on the stable side has
much weaker influence compared with that on the unstable side. This is because
that plumes are generated on the unstable side, and that controlling the origin
of plumes is more effective.

instabilities requiring repeated fine tuning. In this paper we present a
minimal, self tuning scalar field model that can dynamically cancel a large
quantum vacuum energy, avoiding Weinberg's No Go Theorem, and produce
accelerated de Sitter expansion at a lower energy scale as a solution to the
problem. Our minimal model, which contains a non canonical kinetic energy and a
linear potential, belongs to the Kinetic Gravity Braiding subclass of Horndeski
theory which is not observationally excluded, and lies outside of the known Fab
Four or Well Tempered models. We find analytic solutions in the limits of slow
roll and fast roll, and numerically solve the equations of motion to illustrate
our model. We show that the model allows for a matter dominated era, and that
the attractor solution is stable under a phase transition in the vacuum energy
density. We also consider the energy scales required to match observations. Our
model shows the existence of a wider class of successful self tuning models

benefit of knowledge tracing is that students' learning plans can be better

recent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success.
Other works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and
redefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However,
these efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: 1) they pay
too much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic
information; 2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and
complex structures of the nodes; and 3) they represent either concepts or
exercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in
self-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based
Knowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we
design a two-layer contrastive learning scheme based on an
""exercise-to-exercise"" (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level
contrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of
exercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative
representations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to
obtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we
explored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks
as the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of

initial conditions, a no-slip boundary condition for the velocity field and
homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions for the phase functions as well as for
the chemical potentials. We first prove the existence of a global weak

assumptions on the initial data allow us to prove the existence of a unique

  & Data Analysis",,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Spurred in part by the ever-growing number of sensors and web-based methods
of collecting data, the use of Intensive Longitudinal Data (ILD) is becoming
more common in the social and behavioural sciences. The ILD collected in this
field are often hypothesised to be the result of latent states (e.g. behaviour,
emotions), and the promise of ILD lies in its ability to capture the dynamics
of these states as they unfold in time. In particular, by collecting data for
multiple subjects, researchers can observe how such dynamics differ between
subjects. The Bayesian Multilevel Hidden Markov Model (mHMM) is a relatively
novel model that is suited to model the ILD of this kind while taking into
account heterogeneity between subjects. While the mHMM has been applied in a
variety of settings, large-scale studies that examine the required sample size
for this model are lacking. In this paper, we address this research gap by
conducting a simulation study to evaluate the effect of changing (1) the number
of subjects, (2) the number of occasions, and (3) the between subjects
variability on parameter estimates obtained by the mHMM. We frame this
simulation study in the context of sleep research, which consists of
multivariate continuous data that displays considerable overlap in the state
dependent component distributions. In addition, we generate a set of baseline
scenarios with more general data properties. Overall, the number of subjects
has the largest effect on model performance. However, the number of occasions
is important to adequately model latent state transitions. We discuss how the
characteristics of the data influence parameter estimation and provide
recommendations to researchers seeking to apply the mHMM to their own data.

  Privacy",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers are one of the most widely-used blockchain
privacy solutions, operating on top of smart contract-enabled blockchains. We
find that ZKP mixers are tightly intertwined with the growing number of
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks and Blockchain Extractable Value (BEV)
extractions. Through coin flow tracing, we discover that 205 blockchain
attackers and 2,595 BEV extractors leverage mixers as their source of funds,
while depositing a total attack revenue of 412.87M USD. Moreover, the US OFAC
sanctions against the largest ZKP mixer, Tornado.Cash, have reduced the mixer's
daily deposits by more than 80%.
  Further, ZKP mixers advertise their level of privacy through a so-called
anonymity set size, which similarly to k-anonymity allows a user to hide among
a set of k other users. Through empirical measurements, we, however, find that
these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate. For the most popular mixers
on Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), we show how to reduce the
anonymity set size on average by 27.34% and 46.02% respectively. Our empirical
evidence is also the first to suggest a differing privacy-predilection of users
on ETH and BSC.
  State-of-the-art ZKP mixers are moreover interwoven with the DeFi ecosystem
by offering anonymity mining (AM) incentives, i.e., users receive monetary
rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the claims of related work, we
find that AM does not necessarily improve the quality of a mixer's anonymity
set. Our findings indicate that AM attracts privacy-ignorant users, who then do
not contribute to improving the privacy of other mixer users.

interpreting any MD studies of pressure effects since these are governed by

scales well with value of local internal shear component of virial stress
$S_{xy}$ and not with external shear pressure. Dynamics of stress penetration
is described well within the model of damped harmonic oscillator, where
characteristic oscillation frequency depends on number of crystallographic
layers in direction along the wave propagation while the speed of stress

phenomenon in irradiated protoplanetary disks (PPDs), yet the mechanism by
which it saturates remains poorly understood. Global simulations suggest that
the non-linear evolution of the VSI is dominated by radially propagating
inertial wavetrains (called `body modes'), but these are known to be
susceptible to a parametric instability. In this paper, we propose that the
global VSI saturates via this secondary instability, which initiates a
redistribution of energy from the large scales to smaller-scale inertial waves,
and finally into a turbulent cascade. We present an analytic theory of the
instability in a simple idealised model that captures the main physical and
mathematical details of the problem. In addition, we conduct numerical
simulations with the SNOOPY code to consolidate the theory. Once the parametric
instability prevails, the VSI is likely far more disordered and incoherent than
current global simulations suggest. We also argue that it is challenging to
capture parametric instability in global simulations unless the radial
resolution is very fine, possibly $\sim 300$ grid cells per scale height in
radius.

mixture model (LrMM) assuming each matrix-valued observation has a planted
low-rank structure. Minimax lower bounds for estimating the underlying low-rank
matrix are established allowing a whole range of sample sizes and signal
strength. Under a minimal condition on signal strength, referred to as the
information-theoretical limit or statistical limit, we prove the minimax
optimality of a maximum likelihood estimator which, in general, is
computationally infeasible. If the signal is stronger than a certain threshold,
called the computational limit, we design a computationally fast estimator
based on spectral aggregation and demonstrate its minimax optimality. Moreover,
when the signal strength is smaller than the computational limit, we provide
evidences based on the low-degree likelihood ratio framework to claim that no
polynomial-time algorithm can consistently recover the underlying low-rank
matrix. Our results reveal multiple phase transitions in the minimax error
rates and the statistical-to-computational gap. Numerical experiments confirm

  Perturbations",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Counterfactual explanations (CEs) are a powerful means for understanding how
decisions made by algorithms can be changed. Researchers have proposed a number
of desiderata that CEs should meet to be practically useful, such as requiring
minimal effort to enact, or complying with causal models. We consider a further
aspect to improve the usability of CEs: robustness to adverse perturbations,
which may naturally happen due to unfortunate circumstances. Since CEs
typically prescribe a sparse form of intervention (i.e., only a subset of the
features should be changed), we study the effect of addressing robustness
separately for the features that are recommended to be changed and those that
are not. Our definitions are workable in that they can be incorporated as
penalty terms in the loss functions that are used for discovering CEs. To
experiment with robustness, we create and release code where five data sets
(commonly used in the field of fair and explainable machine learning) have been
enriched with feature-specific annotations that can be used to sample
meaningful perturbations. Our experiments show that CEs are often not robust
and, if adverse perturbations take place (even if not worst-case), the
intervention they prescribe may require a much larger cost than anticipated, or
even become impossible. However, accounting for robustness in the search
process, which can be done rather easily, allows discovering robust CEs
systematically. Robust CEs make additional intervention to contrast
perturbations much less costly than non-robust CEs. We also find that
robustness is easier to achieve for the features to change, posing an important
point of consideration for the choice of what counterfactual explanation is

  quasars?: Insights from a radio-infrared image stacking analysis","Accepted by A&A","A&A 663, A153 (2022)","10.1051/0004-6361/202039750",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Radio emission in the brightest radio quasars can be attributed to processes
inherent to SMBHs, while the origins of the radio fluxes in quasars without
radio detections is still uncertain. We investigate the radio-infrared
continuum of LOFAR radio-detected quasars (RDQs) and LOFAR radio-undetected
quasars (RUQs) in the $9.3\:\textrm{deg}^{2}$ NDWFS-Bo\""otes field; RUQs are
quasars that are individually undetected at $\geq5\sigma$ by LOFAR. We used a
median image stacking procedure. This was done in the frequencies of 150 MHz,
325 MHz, 1.4 GHz and 3.0 GHz, and in nine infrared (ir) bands between $8$ and
$500\;\mu\textrm{m}$. The radio and ir photometry allow us to derive the median
spectral energy distributions of RDQs and RUQs in four z-bins between
$0<z<6.15$. The ir star-formation rate (SFR) is compared with two independent
radio-based star-formation (SF) tracers using the far-ir radio correlation
(FIRC) of SF galaxies. We find a good agreement between our radio and ir SFR
measurements and the FIRC predictions. Moreover, we use the FIRC predictions to
establish the contribution due to SMBH accretion to the total radio-luminosity
(RL). We show that SMBH accretion can account for $\sim5-41\%$ of the total RL
in median RUQs, while for median RDQs the contribution is $\sim50-84\%$. This
implies that vigorous SF activity is coeval with SMBH growth in our median
stacked quasars. Furthermore, we investigated the radio-loudness parameter,
$R$. For quasars with $R\geq-4.5$, the RL is consistent with being dominated by
SMBH accretion, while for low RL quasars with $R<-4.5$ the relative
contribution of SF to the radio fluxes increases as the SMBH component becomes
weaker. We also find signatures of negative AGN feedback in the brightest
median RDQs at 150 MHz. Finally, we found that spectral indices of quasars do
not evolve significantly with z, but they become flatter towards lower freqs.

application. In this work, to avoid the time-consuming and laborious experiment
trial, a high-throughput computational strategy based on first-principles
calculations is designed for screening corrosion-resistant binary Mg alloy with
intermetallics, from both the thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. The
stable binary Mg intermetallics with low equilibrium potential difference with
respect to the Mg matrix are firstly identified. Then, the hydrogen adsorption
energies on the surfaces of these Mg intermetallics are calculated, and the
corrosion exchange current density is further calculated by a hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) kinetic model. Several intermetallics, e.g. Y3Mg, Y2Mg
and La5Mg, are identified to be promising intermetallics which might
effectively hinder the cathodic HER. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) models
are developed to predict Mg intermetallics with proper hydrogen adsorption
energy employing work function (W_f) and weighted first ionization energy
(WFIE). The generalization of the ML models is tested on five new binary Mg
intermetallics with the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.11 eV. This
study not only predicts some promising binary Mg intermetallics which may
suppress the galvanic corrosion, but also provides a high-throughput screening
strategy and ML models for the design of corrosion-resistant alloy, which can
be extended to ternary Mg alloys or other alloy systems.

low-complexity transmitter design, two analytical precoders, one closed-form
method of adjusting the RIS phase-shifting matrices, and semi-iterative power
allocation (PA) strategy of maximizing secrecy sum rate (SSR) are proposed.
First, the geometric parallelogram (GPG) criterion is employed to give the
phase-shifting matrices of RISs. Then, two precoders, called maximizing
singular value (Max-SV) and maximizing signal-to-leakage-noise ratio
(Max-SLNR), are proposed to enhance the SSR. Evenly, the maximizing SSR PA with
hybrid iterative closed-form (HICF) is further proposed to improve the SSR and
derived to be one root of a sixth-order polynomial computed by: (1) the
Newton-Raphson algorithm is repeated twice to reduce the order of the
polynomial from six to four; (2) the remaining four feasible solutions can be
directly obtained by the Ferrari's method. Simulation results show that using
the proposed Max-SV and Max-SLNR, the proposed GPG makes a significant SSR
improvement over random phase and no RIS. Given GPG, the proposed Max-SV
outperforms the proposed leakage for small-scale or medium-scale RIS.
Particularly, the proposed HICF PA stragey shows about ten percent performance
gain over equal PA.

intergenerational equity issues caused by Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
projects. Indeed, more PPPs mean more debt being accumulated for future
generations leading to a fiscal deficit crisis. The paper draws on how the SDR
level taken today distributes societies on the Social Welfare Function (SWF).
This is done by answering two sub-questions: (i) What is the risk of PPPs debts
being off-balance sheet? (ii) How do public policies, based on the envisaged
SDR, position society within different ethical perspectives? The answers are
obtained from a discussion of the different SDRs (applied in the UK for
examples) according to the merits of the pertinent ethical theories, namely
libertarian, egalitarian, utilitarian and Rawlsian. We find that public
policymakers can manipulate the SDR to make PPPs looking like a better option
than the traditional financing form. However, this antagonises the Value for
Money principle. We also point out that public policy is not harmonised with
ethical theories. We find that at present (in the UK), the SDR is somewhere
between weighted utilitarian and Rawlsian societies in the trade-off curve.
Alas, our study finds no evidence that the (UK) government is using a
sophisticated system to keep pace with the accumulated off-balance sheet debts.
Thus, the exact prediction of the final state is hardly made because of the
uncertainty factor. We conclude that our study hopefully provides a good
analytical framework for policymakers in order to draw on the merits of ethical
theories before initiating public policies like PPPs.

has been receiving increasing attention due to its fast learning capability and
improving data efficiency. However, online RL often suffers from complex Value
Function Approximation (VFA) and catastrophic interference, creating difficulty
for the deep neural network to be applied to an online RL algorithm in a fully
online setting. Therefore, a simpler and more adaptive approach is introduced
to evaluate value function with the kernel-based model. Sparse representations
are superior at handling interference, indicating that competitive sparse
representations should be learnable, non-prior, non-truncated and explicit when
compared with current sparse representation methods. Moreover, in learning
sparse representations, attention mechanisms are utilized to represent the
degree of sparsification, and a smooth attentive function is introduced into
the kernel-based VFA. In this paper, we propose an Online Attentive

Experimental evaluations showed that OAKTD outperformed several Online

stellar mass functions broadly consistent with observations, with no scarcity
of massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2.7$, but with a higher quiescent
galaxy fraction at high masses in IllustrisTNG. Average ages of simulated
quiescent galaxies are between 0.8 and 1.0 Gyr, older by a factor $\sim2$ than
observed in spectroscopically-confirmed quiescent galaxies at similar redshift.
Besides being potentially indicative of issues with star-formation recipes in
simulations, this discrepancy might also be partly explained by limitations in
the estimation of observed ages. We investigate the purity of simulated UVJ
rest-frame colorselected massive quiescent samples with photometric
uncertainties typical of deep surveys (e.g., COSMOS). We find evidence for
significant contamination (up to 60 percent) by dusty star-forming galaxies in
the UVJ region that is typically populated by older quiescent sources.
Furthermore, simulations suggest that the completeness of UVJ-selected
quiescent samples at this redshift may be reduced by 30 percent due to a high
fraction of young quiescent galaxies not entering the UVJ quiescent region.
Massive, quiescent galaxies in simulations have on average lower angular
momenta and higher projected axis ratios and concentrations than star-forming
counterparts. Average sizes of simulated quiescent galaxies are relatively
close to observed ones, and broadly consistent within the uncertainties. The
average size ratio of quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the probed mass
range is formally consistent with observations, although this result is partly
affected by poor statistics.

The increasingly popular Deep Learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods
perform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive
indoor radio measurement data. However, with the increasing complexity these
methods become computationally very intensive and energy hungry, both for their
training and subsequent operation. Considering only mobile users, estimated to
exceed 7.4billion by the end of 2025, and assuming that the networks serving
these users will need to perform only one localization per user per hour on
average, the machine learning models used for the calculation would need to
perform 65*10^12 predictions per year. Add to this equation tens of billions of
other connected devices and applications that rely heavily on more frequent
location updates, and it becomes apparent that localization will contribute
significantly to carbon emissions unless more energy-efficient models are
developed and used. This motivated our work on a new DL-based architecture for
indoor localization that is more energy efficient compared to related

degradation. A detailed performance evaluation shows that the proposed model
producesonly 58 % of the carbon footprint while maintaining 98.7 % of the

to the rank-size law technique. It is examined whether the distributions obey
an exponential or a power law. A correlation with the country Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), an admittedly major determinant of EF, follows, distinguishing
regional aspects, i.e. defining 6 continents. Semi-log plots show that the
EFW-rank relationship is exponential for countries of high rank ($\ge 20$);
overall the log-log plots point to a behaviour close to a power law. In
contrast, for the IEF, the overall ranking has an exponential behaviour; but
the log-log plots point to the existence of a transitional point between two
different power laws, i.e., near rank 10. Moreover, log-log plots of the EFW
index relationship to country GDP is characterised by a power law, with a
rather stable exponent ($\gamma \simeq 0.674$) as a function of time. In
contrast, log-log plots of the IEF relationship with the country's gross
domestic product point to a downward evolutive power law as a function of time.
Markedly the two studied indices provide different aspects of EF.

  Recovery of Subspaces of Unknown Codimension",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robust subspace recovery (RSR) is a fundamental problem in robust
representation learning. Here we focus on a recently proposed RSR method termed
Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) approach, which aims to recover a basis
of the orthogonal complement of the subspace and is amenable to handling
subspaces of high relative dimension. Prior work has shown that DPCP can
provably recover the correct subspace in the presence of outliers, as long as
the true dimension of the subspace is known. We show that DPCP can provably
solve RSR problems in the {\it unknown} subspace dimension regime, as long as
orthogonality constraints -- adopted in previous DPCP formulations -- are
relaxed and random initialization is used instead of spectral one. Namely, we
propose a very simple algorithm based on running multiple instances of a
projected sub-gradient descent method (PSGM), with each problem instance
seeking to find one vector in the null space of the subspace. We theoretically
prove that under mild conditions this approach will succeed with high
probability. In particular, we show that 1) all of the problem instances will
converge to a vector in the nullspace of the subspace and 2) the ensemble of
problem instance solutions will be sufficiently diverse to fully span the
nullspace of the subspace thus also revealing its true unknown codimension. We
provide empirical results that corroborate our theoretical results and showcase
the remarkable implicit rank regularization behavior of PSGM algorithm that
allows us to perform RSR without being aware of the subspace dimension.

closed-form expression is derived for the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)

many multi-modal methods are proposed to study the complex mechanisms of
cancers, and most of them achieve comparable or better results from previous
single-modal methods. However, these multi-modal methods are restricted to a
single task (e.g., survival analysis or grade classification), and thus neglect
the correlation between different tasks. In this study, we present a
multi-modal fusion framework based on multi-task correlation learning
(MultiCoFusion) for survival analysis and cancer grade classification, which
combines the power of multiple modalities and multiple tasks. Specifically, a
pre-trained ResNet-152 and a sparse graph convolutional network (SGCN) are used
to learn the representations of histopathological images and mRNA expression
data respectively. Then these representations are fused by a fully connected
neural network (FCNN), which is also a multi-task shared network. Finally, the
results of survival analysis and cancer grade classification output
simultaneously. The framework is trained by an alternate scheme. We
systematically evaluate our framework using glioma datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results demonstrate that MultiCoFusion learns better
representations than traditional feature extraction methods. With the help of
multi-task alternating learning, even simple multi-modal concatenation can
achieve better performance than other deep learning and traditional methods.
Multi-task learning can improve the performance of multiple tasks not just one

devices, such as image classification, speech recognition, and augmented
reality. There is an increasing need of training such models on the devices in
order to deliver personalized, responsive, and private learning. To address
this need, this paper presents a new solution for deploying and training
state-of-the-art models on the resource-constrained devices. First, the paper
proposes a novel filter-pruning-based model compression method to create
lightweight trainable models from large models trained in the cloud, without
much loss of accuracy. Second, it proposes a novel knowledge transfer method to
enable the on-device model to update incrementally in real time or near real
time using incremental learning on new data and enable the on-device model to
learn the unseen categories with the help of the in-cloud model in an
unsupervised fashion. The results show that 1) our model compression method can
remove up to 99.36% parameters of WRN-28-10, while preserving a Top-1 accuracy
of over 90% on CIFAR-10; 2) our knowledge transfer method enables the
compressed models to achieve more than 90% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and retain good
accuracy on old categories; 3) it allows the compressed models to converge
within real time (three to six minutes) on the edge for incremental learning
tasks; 4) it enables the model to classify unseen categories of data (78.92%
Top-1 accuracy) that it is never trained with.

  of two interacting atoms","47 pages, 23 figures, affiliation added",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We first use the quantum method to replicate the well-known results of a
single atom relaxing, whilst demonstrating the intuitive picture it provides
for dissipative dynamics. By use of individual ""quantum trajectories"", the
method allows for simulation of systems inaccessible to ensemble treatments.
This is shown by replicating resonance fluorescence, allowing us to
concurrently demonstrate the method's facilitation of calculating photon
statistics by the creation of discrete photon streams. To analyse these, we
solidify the theoretical basis for, and implement, a computational method of
calculating second-order coherence functions. A process by which to model
interacting two-atom systems to allow for computation with the quantum jump
method is then developed. Using this, we demonstrate cooperative effects
leading to greatly modified emission spectra, before investigating the
decoupling of states from dissipative and coherent interactions. Here, we find
the novel insight provided by the quantum jump method both births and provides
the tools with which to begin an investigation into the occurrence of
macroscopic jumps and the formation of macroscopic dark periods in a system of
two two-level dipole-dipole coupled atoms.

2022), 10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111291] that relies on numerical schemes to enable
machine-learning operations on demand. In particular, our routine features
double predicting to harness curvature symmetry invariance in favor of
precision and stability. The core of this solver is a multilayer perceptron
trained on circular- and sinusoidal-interface samples. Its role is to quantify
the error in numerical curvature approximations and emit corrected estimates
for select grid vertices along the free boundary. These corrections arise in
response to preprocessed context level-set, curvature, and gradient data. To
promote neural capacity, we have adopted sample negative-curvature
normalization, reorientation, and reflection-based augmentation. In the same
manner, our system incorporates dimensionality reduction, well-balancedness,
and regularization to minimize outlying effects. Our training approach is
likewise scalable across mesh sizes. For this purpose, we have introduced
dimensionless parametrization and probabilistic subsampling during data
production. Together, all these elements have improved the accuracy and
efficiency of curvature calculations around under-resolved regions. In most
experiments, our strategy has outperformed the numerical baseline at twice the
number of redistancing steps while requiring only a fraction of the cost.

  user persuasiveness & discriminatory decision making: An Empirical Study","Fresh experiments need to be added to the design of experiments",,,,"cs.CL cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Language data and models demonstrate various types of bias, be it ethnic,
religious, gender, or socioeconomic. AI/NLP models, when trained on the
racially biased dataset, AI/NLP models instigate poor model explainability,
influence user experience during decision making and thus further magnifies
societal biases, raising profound ethical implications for society. The
motivation of the study is to investigate how AI systems imbibe bias from data
and produce unexplainable discriminatory outcomes and influence an individual's
articulateness of system outcome due to the presence of racial bias features in
datasets. The design of the experiment involves studying the counterfactual
impact of racial bias features present in language datasets and its associated
effect on the model outcome. A mixed research methodology is adopted to
investigate the cross implication of biased model outcome on user experience,
effect on decision-making through controlled lab experimentation. The findings
provide foundation support for correlating the implication of carry-over an
artificial intelligence model solving NLP task due to biased concept presented
in the dataset. Further, the research outcomes justify the negative influence
on users' persuasiveness that leads to alter the decision-making quotient of an
individual when trying to rely on the model outcome to act. The paper bridges
the gap across the harm caused in establishing poor customer trustworthiness
due to an inequitable system design and provides strong support for
researchers, policymakers, and data scientists to build responsible AI

the planets of the solar system in an elegant and compact form by using the
2/3rd power of the ratios of the semi-major axis lengths of two neighboring
planets (eight pairs, including the belt of the asteroids). This metric
suggests that the solar system could be characterized by a scaling and
mirror-like structure relative to the asteroid belt that relates together the
terrestrial and Jovian planets. These relations are based on a 9/8 ratio
multiplied by powers of 2, which correspond musically to the interval of the
Pythagorean epogdoon (a Major Second) and its addition with one or more
octaves. Extensions of the same model are discussed and found compatible also
with the still hypothetical vulcanoid asteroids versus the transneptunian
objects. The found relation also suggests that the planetary self-organization
of our system could be generated by the 3:1 and 7:3 resonances of Jupiter,
which are already known to have shaped the asteroid belt. The proposed model
predicts the main Kirkwood asteroid gaps and the ratio among the planetary
orbital parameters with a 99% accuracy.
