Moreover, stealing a target encoder using StolenEncoder requires much less data

three defenses that perturb feature vectors produced by a target encoder. Our
results show these defenses are not enough to mitigate StolenEncoder.

architecture with a quadratic algorithm, so it takes longer to train, but it
can generalize better with less data. The PaT parser has a simpler architecture
with a linear algorithm, speeding up training time but requiring more training

welfare, even if positive, there is a risk of negative effect on, say, some 10%

individual treatment effect (ITE) is never observed, so the 10% worst-affected
cannot be identified, while distributional treatment effects only compare the
first deciles within each treatment group, which does not correspond to any
10%-subpopulation. In this paper we consider how to nonetheless assess this
important risk measure, formalized as the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of
the ITE-distribution. We leverage the availability of pre-treatment covariates
and characterize the tightest-possible upper and lower bounds on ITE-CVaR given
by the covariate-conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. We then
proceed to study how to estimate these bounds efficiently from data and
construct confidence intervals. This is challenging even in randomized
experiments as it requires understanding the distribution of the unknown CATE
function, which can be very complex if we use rich covariates so as to best
control for heterogeneity. We develop a debiasing method that overcomes this
and prove it enjoys favorable statistical properties even when CATE and other

to account for the present accelerating expansion of the universe while solving
at the same time the core-cusp problem of the CDM model. In the logotropic
model, there is a single dark fluid. Its rest-mass plays the role of dark
matter and its internal energy plays the role of dark energy. We highlight two
remarkable predictions of the logotropic model. It yields cored dark matter
halos with a universal surface density equal to $\Sigma_0^{\rm th}=0.01955
c\sqrt{\Lambda}/G=133\, M_{\odot}/{\rm pc}^2$ without free parameter in very
good agreement with the observational value $\Sigma_0^{\rm

ratio of dark energy and dark matter to be the pure number $\Omega_{\rm
de,0}^{\rm th}/\Omega_{\rm dm,0}^{\rm th}=e=2.71828...$ in very good agreement
with the observations giving $\Omega_{\rm de,0}^{\rm obs}/\Omega_{\rm
dm,0}^{\rm obs}=2.669\pm 0.08$. Using the measured present proportion of
baryonic matter $\Omega_{\rm b,0}^{\rm obs}=0.0486\pm 0.0010$, we find that the
values of the present proportion of dark matter and dark energy are
$\Omega_{\rm dm,0}^{\rm th}=\frac{1}{1+e}(1-\Omega_{\rm b,0})=0.2559$ and
$\Omega_{\rm de,0}^{\rm th}=\frac{e}{1+e}(1-\Omega_{\rm b,0})=0.6955$ in very

a mysterious strong cosmic coincidence (dubbed ""dark magic"") implying that our

field satisfies a nonlinear wave equation generalizing the Klein-Gordon
equation in the relativistic regime and the Schr\""odinger equation in the
nonrelativistic regime. This model has an intrinsically quantum nature and
returns the $\Lambda$CDM model in the classical limit $\hbar\rightarrow 0$. It
involves a new fundamental constant of physics $A/c^2=2.10\times 10^{-26}\,

Universe and superseding the Einstein cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The
logotropic model is almost indistinguishable from the $\Lambda$CDM model at
large (cosmological) scales but solves the CDM crisis at small (galactic)
scales. It also solves the problems of the fuzzy dark matter model. Indeed, it
leads to cored dark matter halos with a universal surface density
$\Sigma_0^{\rm th}=5.85\,\left ({A}/{4\pi G}\right )^{1/2}=133\, M_{\odot}/{\rm

diffraction-limited images over much larger fields of view than traditional
single conjugate adaptive optics systems. In MCAO, the high altitude deformable
mirrors (DMs) cause a distortion of the pupil plane and lead to a dynamic
misregistration between the DM actuators and the wavefront sensors (WFSs). The
problem is much more acute for solar astronomy than for night-time observations
due to the higher spatial sampling of the WFSs and DMs, and the fact that the
science observations are often made through stronger turbulence and at lower
elevations. The dynamic misregistration limits the quality of the correction
provided by solar MCAO systems. In this paper, we present PropAO, the first AO
simulation tool (to our knowledge) to model the effect of pupil distortion. It
takes advantage of the Python implementation of the optical propagation library
PROPER. PropAO uses Fresnel propagation to propagate the amplitude and phase of
an incoming wave through the atmosphere and the MCAO system. The resulting
wavefront is analyzed by the WFSs and also used to evaluate the corrected image
quality. We are able to reproduce the problem of pupil distortion and test
novel non-linear reconstruction strategies that take the distortion into

protracted since the required movements are not similar to our daily movement
repertoire, and often counter-intuitive. The proposed method can provide a
valuable insight into the subject's learning process and may be used by coaches
to identify potentially successful technique changes. The main novelty is that
instead of comparing directly the trainee's movements to a template or a

independent way of technique analysis. We incorporate design tools of automatic
control theory to link the trainee's movement patterns to specific performance
characteristics. This makes it possible to suggest technique modifications that

linear function approximators for accelerating their convergence speed.
However, A2C algorithms seldom use this technology to train deep neural

propose two novel RLS-based A2C algorithms and investigate their performance.
Both proposed algorithms, called RLSSA2C and RLSNA2C, use the RLS method to
train the critic network and the hidden layers of the actor network. The main
difference between them is at the policy learning step. RLSSA2C uses an
ordinary first-order gradient descent algorithm and the standard policy

at certain groups of people. Due to the easy accessibility of social media
platforms it is crucial to protect everyone which requires building hate speech
detection systems for a wide range of languages. However, the available labeled
hate speech datasets are limited making it problematic to build systems for
many languages. In this paper we focus on cross-lingual transfer learning to
support hate speech detection in low-resource languages. We leverage
cross-lingual word embeddings to train our neural network systems on the source
language and apply it to the target language, which lacks labeled examples, and
show that good performance can be achieved. We then incorporate unlabeled
target language data for further model improvements by bootstrapping labels
using an ensemble of different model architectures. Furthermore, we investigate
the issue of label imbalance of hate speech datasets, since the high ratio of
non-hate examples compared to hate examples often leads to low model
performance. We test simple data undersampling and oversampling techniques and
show their effectiveness.

interventions on COVID-19 development is important for making public health
decisions that control the pandemic. Recently, we created a method in
forecasting the daily number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases by
combining a mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for
infectious classes and a generalized boosting machine learning model (GBM) for
predicting how public health policies and mobility data affect the transmission
rate in the ODE model [WWR+]. In this paper, we extend the method to the
post-vaccination period, accordingly obtain a retrospective forecast of
COVID-19 daily confirmed cases in the US, and identify the relative influence
of the policies used as the predictor variables. In particular, our ODE model
contains both partially and fully vaccinated compartments and accounts for the
breakthrough cases, that is, vaccinated individuals can still get infected. Our
results indicate that the inclusion of data on non-pharmaceutical interventions
can significantly improve the accuracy of the predictions. With the use of
policy data, the model predicts the number of daily infected cases up to 35
days in the future, with an average mean absolute percentage error of 34%,
which is further improved to 21% if combined with human mobility data.
Moreover, similar to the pre-vaccination study, the most influential predictor
variable remains the policy of restrictions on gatherings. The modeling
approach used in this work can help policymakers design control measures as
variant strains threaten public health in the future.

public opinions may become increasingly extreme when they are circulated in
homogeneous communities, thus potentially causing damage in the real world.
Automatically detecting the political ideology of social media users can help
better understand political polarization. However, it is challenging due to the
scarcity of ideology labels, complexity of multimodal contents, and cost of
time-consuming data collection process. In this study, we adopt a heterogeneous
graph neural network to jointly model user characteristics, multimodal post
contents as well as user-item relations in a bipartite graph to learn a
comprehensive and effective user embedding without requiring ideology labels.
We apply our framework to online discussions about economy and public health
topics. The learned embeddings are then used to detect political ideology and
understand political polarization. Our framework outperforms the unimodal,
early/late fusion baselines, and homogeneous GNN frameworks by a margin of at
least 9% absolute gain in the area under the receiver operating characteristic
on two social media datasets. More importantly, our work does not require a
time-consuming data collection process, which allows faster detection and in
turn allows the policy makers to conduct analysis and design policies in time
to respond to crises. We also show that our framework learns meaningful user
embeddings and can help better understand political polarization. Notable
differences in user descriptions, topics, images, and levels of retweet/quote
activities are observed. Our framework for decoding user-content interaction
shows wide applicability in understanding political polarization. Furthermore,
it can be extended to user-item bipartite information networks for other
applications such as content and product recommendation.

couplings of one site complex conjugated to the other site. This model, with no

transitions which is a consequence of the partition function factorizing into a
product over Matsubara frequencies. We calculate the quenched free energy in
two different ways, first in terms of the single-particle energies, and second
by solving the Schwinger-Dyson equations. The first calculation can be done
entirely in terms of a one-site model. The conjugate replica enters due to
non-analyticities when Matsubara frequencies enter the spectral support of the
coupling matrix. The second calculation is based on the replica trick of the
two-site partition function. Both methods give the same result. The
free-fermion partition function can be rephrased as a matrix model for the
coupling matrix. Up to minor details, this model is the random matrix model
that describes the chiral phase transition of QCD, and the order parameter of
the two-body model corresponds to the chiral condensate of QCD. Comparing to
the corresponding four-body model, we are able to determine which features of
the free energy are due to chaotic nature of the four-body model. The
high-temperature phase of both models is entropy dominated, and in both cases
is determined by the spectral density. The four-body SYK model has a
low-temperature phase whose free energy is almost temperature-independent,
signaling an effective gap of the theory even though the actual spectrum does
not exhibit a gap. However the low-temperature free energy of the two-body SYK
model is not flat, in fact it oscillates to arbitrarily low temperature. This
indicates a less desirable feature that the entropy of the two-body model is
not always positive, which most likely is a consequence of the nonhermiticity.

remove this physically imposed stiffness by employing a rescaling scheme, which

overall stabilization of patterns. On the other hand, negative currents make
the interface more unstable and lead to the formation of thin tail structures

a negative current is utilized, the interface tends to approach the origin and
break up into several drops. We investigate the temporal evolution of the

generated by dividing the local neighborhood region into subregions. Thus, CRIP
has ability to preserve macro and micro structural variations in an extensive

Furthermore, gradient information between cross centroid ripples provides
strenght to captures prominent edge features in active patches: eyes, nose and

Employing the special dissipative structure of the non-conservative viscous
compressible two-fluid model with capillarity effects, we first exploit the
maximal regularity estimates for the corresponding linearized system in all
frequencies which behaves like the heat equation. Then we construct the global
well-posedness for the multi-dimensional model when the initial data are close
to a stable equilibrium state in the sense of suitable $L^{ p}$-type Besov
norms. As a consequence, this allows us to work in the framework of Besov space
with negative regularity indices and this fact is particularly important when
the initial data are large highly oscillating in physical dimensions $N= 2, 3$.
Furthermore, based on a refined time weighted inequalities in the Fourier
spaces, we also establish optimal time decay rates for the constructed global
solutions under a mild additional decay assumption involving only the low
frequencies of the initial data.

controlled by adjusting the sampling and transmission rates. This paper
demonstrates that machine learning can be used to analyse complex health data
metrics such as the accuracy and efficiency of data transmission to overcome
the trade-off problem. The study uses time series nonlinear autoregressive

the public's benefit. If no steps toward preserving privacy are taken,
adversaries may use released statistics to deduce unauthorized information
about the individuals described in the private dataset. Differentially private
algorithms address this challenge by slightly perturbing underlying statistics
with noise, thereby mathematically limiting the amount of information that may
be deduced from each data release. Properly calibrating these algorithms -- and
in turn the disclosure risk for people described in the dataset -- requires a
data curator to choose a value for a privacy budget parameter, $\epsilon$.
However, there is little formal guidance for choosing $\epsilon$, a task that
requires reasoning about the probabilistic privacy-utility trade-off.
Furthermore, choosing $\epsilon$ in the context of statistical inference
requires reasoning about accuracy trade-offs in the presence of both
measurement error and differential privacy (DP) noise.
  We present Visualizing Privacy (ViP), an interactive interface that
visualizes relationships between $\epsilon$, accuracy, and disclosure risk to
support setting and splitting $\epsilon$ among queries. As a user adjusts
$\epsilon$, ViP dynamically updates visualizations depicting expected accuracy
and risk. ViP also has an inference setting, allowing a user to reason about
the impact of DP noise on statistical inferences. Finally, we present results
of a study where 16 research practitioners with little to no DP background
completed a set of tasks related to setting $\epsilon$ using both ViP and a

econometrics and many other data science disciplines. We consider the problem
of uniformly estimating a dyadic Lebesgue density function, focusing on
nonparametric kernel-based estimators taking the form of dyadic empirical
processes. Our main contributions include the minimax-optimal uniform
convergence rate of the dyadic kernel density estimator, along with strong
approximation results for the associated standardized and Studentized
$t$-processes. A consistent variance estimator enables the construction of
valid and feasible uniform confidence bands for the unknown density function.
We showcase the broad applicability of our results by developing novel
counterfactual density estimation and inference methodology for dyadic data,
which can be used for causal inference and program evaluation. A crucial
feature of dyadic distributions is that they may be ""degenerate"" at certain
points in the support of the data, a property making our analysis somewhat
delicate. Nonetheless our methods for uniform inference remain robust to the
potential presence of such points. For implementation purposes, we discuss
inference procedures based on positive semi-definite covariance estimators,
mean squared error optimal bandwidth selectors and robust bias correction
techniques. We illustrate the empirical finite-sample performance of our
methods both in simulations and with real-world trade data, for which we make
comparisons between observed and counterfactual trade distributions in
different years. Our technical results concerning strong approximations and
maximal inequalities are of potential independent interest.

diverging, and parallel slits), the effect of slit-area ratios, slit-width, and
its angle with the freestream velocity on aerodynamic forces, vibration
response, and associated flow characteristics. The results demonstrate that the
addition of the slit assists the VIV suppression by adding an extra amount of
flow to the main flow. It results in the stabilized wake with the pressure
recovery downstream of the cylinder and causes a reduction in the lift force
over the cylinder. Also, there exist different shedding patterns associated
with different slit shapes. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) of the flow
field suggests that among all the three slits, the parallel slit heavily
modifies the flow behind the cylinder by distributing the amount of energy to a
large number of modes as compared to other slits (converging slit and diverging
slit), where the most of the energy is contained in a couple of modes. Further,
increasing the slit angle (for parallel slit) with respect to the freestream
increases the slit effectiveness up to a specific value of slit-angle and
beyond that starts to affect the VIV suppression adversely. Observations for
the effect of slit-width are also reported from the perspective of suppression
of VIV.

engineering (e.g., embankment erosion and stability of landfill cover systems).
This article studies the mechanism of nucleation and growth of cracks in clay
at the nanoscale through full-scale molecular dynamics simulations. The clay
adopted is pyrophyllite, and the force field is CLAYFF. The crack formation in
a pyrophyllite clay layer is evaluated under uniaxial tension and simple shear.
The numerical results show that cracks in the nanoscale pyrophyllite clay layer
are brittle and strain-rate dependent. Small strain rate results in low
ultimate tensile/shear strength. As strain rate increases, clay crack shifts
from a single-crack pattern to a multiple-crack one. The cracking mechanism is
investigated from bond breakage analysis at the atomic scale. It is found that
the first bond breakage occurs in the silicon-surface oxygen bond. As a crack
propagates, the relative percentage of broken silicon-surface oxygen bonds is
the smallest compared to other types of metal-oxygen interactions,
demonstrating that the atomic interaction between silicon and surface oxygen
atoms is the strongest. To understand the propagation of cracks, we also study
the stress intensity factor and energy release rate of pyrophyllite and their
size dependence at the atomic scale.

interactions as noise and aim to reduce their impact with some kind of noise
filtering technique, which often suffers from two challenges. First, in real
world, atypical interactions may signal users' temporary interest different
from their general preference. Therefore, simply filtering out the atypical
interactions as noise may be inappropriate and degrade the personalization of
recommendations. Second, it is hard to acquire the temporary interest since
there are no explicit supervision signals to indicate whether an interaction is
atypical or not. To address this challenges, we propose a novel model called
Temporary Interest Aware Recommendation (TIARec), which can distinguish
atypical interactions from normal ones without supervision and capture the
temporary interest as well as the general preference of users. Particularly, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework containing a recommender agent and
an auxiliary classifier agent, which are jointly trained with the objective of
maximizing the cumulative return of the recommendations made by the recommender
agent. During the joint training process, the classifier agent can judge
whether the interaction with an item recommended by the recommender agent is
atypical, and the knowledge about learning temporary interest from atypical
interactions can be transferred to the recommender agent, which makes the
recommender agent able to alone make recommendations that balance the general
preference and temporary interest of users. At last, the experiments conducted
on real world datasets verify the effectiveness of TIARec.

transferring the complementary aspect preferences in other domains, during

to efficiently obtain and organize the object-level landmarks. On the basis of
this, we use a robot-centric mapping framework to represent the environment as
a semantic topology graph and relax the burden of maintaining global

mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of online mapping with
limited computational resources. Based on the proposed map, the robust
localization is achieved by constructing a novel local semantic scene graph
descriptor, and performing multi-constraint graph matching to compare scene
similarity. Finally, we test our method on a low-cost embedded platform to

including deep neural network models used for time series prediction and image

  Soft Negative Samples","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised sentence embedding aims to obtain the most appropriate embedding
for a sentence to reflect its semantic. Contrastive learning has been
attracting developing attention. For a sentence, current models utilize diverse
data augmentation methods to generate positive samples, while consider other
independent sentences as negative samples. Then they adopt InfoNCE loss to pull
the embeddings of positive pairs gathered, and push those of negative pairs
scattered. Although these models have made great progress on sentence
embedding, we argue that they may suffer from feature suppression. The models
fail to distinguish and decouple textual similarity and semantic similarity.
And they may overestimate the semantic similarity of any pairs with similar
textual regardless of the actual semantic difference between them. This is
because positive pairs in unsupervised contrastive learning come with similar
and even the same textual through data augmentation. To alleviate feature
suppression, we propose contrastive learning for unsupervised sentence
embedding with soft negative samples (SNCSE). Soft negative samples share
highly similar textual but have surely and apparently different semantic with
the original samples. Specifically, we take the negation of original sentences
as soft negative samples, and propose Bidirectional Margin Loss (BML) to
introduce them into traditional contrastive learning framework, which merely
involves positive and negative samples. Our experimental results show that
SNCSE can obtain state-of-the-art performance on semantic textual similarity
(STS) task with average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 78.97% on
BERTbase and 79.23% on RoBERTabase. Besides, we adopt rank-based error analysis
method to detect the weakness of SNCSE for future study.

investigated by neutron powder diffraction measurements. It is found that as
the superconductivity gets suppressed with the increase of Ni doping, the
magnetic propagation vector of the Eu sublattice diminishes, corresponding to
the decrease of the rotation angle between the moments in neighboring Eu
layers. The ferromagnetic Eu layers are helically modulated along the
$\mathit{c}$ axis with an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector in both
the ferromagnetic superconductor RbEu(Fe$_{0.95}$Ni$_{0.05}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$ and
the superconducting ferromagnet RbEu(Fe$_{0.93}$Ni$_{0.07}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$.
Such a helical structure transforms into a purely collinear ferromagnetic
structure for non-superconducting RbEu(Fe$_{0.91}$Ni$_{0.09}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$,
with all the Eu$^{2+}$ spins lying along the tetragonal (1 1 0) direction. The
evolution from helical to collinear ferromagnetic order of the Eu$^{2+}$ spins

variation of the rotation angle between adjacent Eu$^{2+}$ layers can be well
explained by considering the change of magnetic exchange couplings mediated by
the indirect Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction.

  problems",,,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We prove new lower bounds for suitable competitive ratio measures of two
relaxed online packing problems: online removable multiple knapsack, and a
recently introduced online minimum peak appointment scheduling problem. The
high level objective in both problems is to pack arriving items of sizes at
most 1 into bins of capacity 1 as efficiently as possible, but the exact
formalizations differ. In the appointment scheduling problem, every item has to
be assigned to a position, which can be seen as a time interval during a
workday of length 1. That is, items are not assigned to bins, but only once all
the items are processed, the optimal number of bins subject to chosen positions
is determined, and this is the cost of the online algorithm. On the other hand,
in the removable knapsack problem there is a fixed number of bins, and the goal
of packing items, which consists in choosing a particular bin for every packed
item (and nothing else), is to pack as valuable a subset as possible. In this
last problem it is possible to reject items, that is, deliberately not pack
them, as well as to remove packed items at any later point in time, which adds
flexibility to the problem.

implicit label noise canceling and exploits correlations between the source and

their numbers may be unbalanced, many agents concentrate on such locations
resulting in inefficient operations, often becoming stuck or deadlocked. Thus,

region that increased applied magnetic field ($\Delta$H) is the same as
increasing magnetic induction ($\Delta$B). Magnetization (M) is constant in the
region by 4$\pi$M = B - H. Here we show that the behavior of fluxes in

defects would move as a bundle in the region by repeating flux-pinning and
pick-out depinning process from the surface to the center of the

states that are flux-pinning state at volume defects and pick-out depinning
state in which fluxes are moving in the superconductor. A difference of
diamagnetic property occurs between pinning state at volume defects and
depinning state from the volume defects. Thus, diamagnetic properties of the

would be observed in M-H curve. The oscillation can be used for qubit by
setting the pinning state at volume defects as $\ket{1}$ and the depinned state
as $\ket{0}$. This method can operate at higher temperatures than that of using
Josephson Junctions. In addition, it is expected that the device is quite

adversary, which has attracted much attention due to its key role in broad
applications. In this paper, we study a new false data injection (FDI) attack
design problem, where the adversary with limited capability aims to select a
subset of agents and manipulate their local multi-dimensional states to
maximize the consensus convergence error. We first formulate the FDI attack
design problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and prove it is NP-hard.
Then, based on the submodularity optimization theory, we show the convergence
error is a submodular function of the set of the compromised agents, which
satisfies the property of diminishing marginal returns. In other words, the
benefit of adding an extra agent to the compromised set decreases as that set
becomes larger. With this property, we exploit the greedy scheme to find the
optimal compromised agent set that can produce the maximum convergence error
when adding one extra agent to that set each time. Thus, the FDI attack set
selection algorithms are developed to obtain the near-optimal subset of the
compromised agents. Furthermore, we derive the analytical suboptimality bounds
and the worst-case running time under the proposed algorithms. Extensive
simulation results are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed

polarizations in cubic perovskite oxides AMn3Cr4O12 (A = La and Tb) resides on
the topological Roman surface, a non-orientable two-dimensional manifold formed
by sewing a Mobius strip edge to that of a disc. The induced polarization may
travel in a loop along the non-orientable Mobius strip or orientable disc
depending on how the spin evolves as controlled by external magnetic field.
Experimentally, the periodicity of polarization can be the same or the twice of
the rotating magnetic field, being well consistent with the orientability of
disc and Mobius strip, respectively. This path dependent topological
magnetoelectric effect presents a way to detect the global geometry of the
surface and deepens our understanding of topology in both mathematics and
physics

property $P$, for each $1\leq i\leq k$. When property $P$ be that each color
class contains no copy of $G$, we write $\chi_{G}(H)$ instead of $\chi(G,P)$,
which is called the $G$-free chromatic number. Due to this, we say $H$ has a
$k$-$G$-free coloring if there is a map $c : V(H) \longrightarrow
\{1,\ldots,k\}$, so that each of the color classes of $c$ be $G$-free. Assume
that for each vertex $v$ of a graph $H$ is assigned a set $L(V)$ of colors,

sequential behaviors are \textit{\textbf{uncertain}} rather than deterministic,
posing a significant challenge to present techniques. We further suggest that
dot-product-based approaches cannot fully capture \textit{\textbf{collaborative

Wasserstein attentions also enlighten the collaborative transitivity learning

high-level image features. As a result, the proposed model significantly
reduces the bit-error rate to empirically 0% and the required network

has attracted significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose
an improved three-dimensional (3D) thermal multiphase LB model for simulating
liquid-vapor phase change. The proposed model has the following features.
First, it is still within the framework of the thermal LB method using a
temperature distribution function and therefore retains the fundamental
advantages of the thermal LB method. Second, in the existing thermal LB models
for liquid-vapor phase change, the finite-difference computations of the
gradient terms $\nabla \cdot u$ and $\nabla T$ usually require special
treatment at boundary nodes, while in the proposed thermal LB model these two
terms are calculated locally. Moreover, in some of the existing thermal LB
models, the error term ${\partial _{{t_0}}}\left( {Tu} \right)$ is eliminated
by adding local correction terms to the collision process in the moment space,
which causes these thermal LB models to be limited to the D2Q9 lattice in two
dimensions and the D3Q15 or D3Q19 lattice in three dimensions. Conversely, the
proposed model does not suffer from such an error term and therefore the
thermal LB equation can be constructed on the D3Q7 lattice, which simplifies
the model and improves the computational efficiency. Numerical simulations are
carried out to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed thermal
multiphase LB model for simulating liquid-vapor phase change.

industry and academic communities. Traditional models mostly rely on the
inverse propensity score (IPS), which can be hard to estimate and may suffer
from the high variance issue. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we
propose a novel debiased recommendation framework based on user feature
balancing. The general idea is to introduce a projection function to adjust
user feature distributions, such that the ideal unbiased learning objective can
be upper bounded by a solvable objective purely based on the offline dataset.
In the upper bound, the projected user distributions are expected to be equal
given different items. From the causal inference perspective, this requirement
aims to remove the causal relation from the user to the item, which enables us
to achieve unbiased recommendation, bypassing the computation of IPS. In order
to efficiently balance the user distributions upon each item pair, we propose
three strategies, including clipping, sampling and adversarial learning to
improve the training process. For more robust optimization, we deploy an
explicit model to capture the potential latent confounders in recommendation
systems. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work on debiased
recommendation based on confounder balancing. In the experiments, we compare
our framework with many state-of-the-art methods based on synthetic,

every day around the world. In order to better adopt stray animals, scoring the
pawpularity (cuteness) of stray animals is very important, but evaluating the
pawpularity of animals is a very labor-intensive thing. Consequently, there has
been an urgent surge of interest to develop an algorithm that scores
pawpularity of animals. However, the dataset in Kaggle not only has images, but
also metadata describing images. Most methods basically focus on the most
advanced image regression methods in recent years, but there is no good method
to deal with the metadata of images. To address the above challenges, the paper
proposes an image regression model called PETS-SWINF that considers metadata of
the images. Our results based on a dataset of Kaggle competition,
""PetFinder.my"", show that PETS-SWINF has an advantage over only based images
models. Our results shows that the RMSE loss of the proposed model on the test
dataset is 17.71876 but 17.76449 without metadata. The advantage of the
proposed method is that PETS-SWINF can consider both low-order and high-order
features of metadata, and adaptively adjust the weights of the image model and
the metadata model. The performance is promising as our leadboard score is
ranked 15 out of 3545 teams (Gold medal) currently for 2021 Kaggle competition

overparameterization, regularization techniques are critical for finding
optimal solutions in the huge hypothesis space. In this paper, we propose an
effective regularization technique, called Neighborhood Region Smoothing (NRS).
NRS leverages the finding that models would benefit from converging to flat
minima, and tries to regularize the neighborhood region in weight space to
yield approximate outputs. Specifically, gap between outputs of models in the
neighborhood region is gauged by a defined metric based on Kullback-Leibler
divergence. This metric provides similar insights with the minimum description
length principle on interpreting flat minima. By minimizing both this
divergence and empirical loss, NRS could explicitly drive the optimizer towards
converging to flat minima. We confirm the effectiveness of NRS by performing
image classification tasks across a wide range of model architectures on
commonly-used datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet, where generalization ability
could be universally improved. Also, we empirically show that the minima found
by NRS would have relatively smaller Hessian eigenvalues compared to the
conventional method, which is considered as the evidence of flat minima.

0.05 mag. All the $R$ and $I$/$i$-band light curves show a weak secondary
peak/shoulder feature at about 3 weeks after the peak, like some transitional
subclass of SNe Ia, which could result from an incomplete merger of
near-infrared (NIR) double peaks. The spectra are characterized by Ti~{\sc ii}

(DNNs) by revealing and repairing the vulnerability of DNNs with specialized
adversarial examples. Parts of the attack examples have imperceptible
perturbations restricted by Lp norm. However, due to their high-frequency
property, the adversarial examples usually have poor transferability and can be
defensed by denoising methods. To avoid the defects, some works make the
perturbations unrestricted to gain better robustness and transferability.
However, these examples usually look unnatural and alert the guards. To
generate unrestricted adversarial examples with high image quality and good
transferability, in this paper, we propose Adversarial Lightness Attack (ALA),
a white-box unrestricted adversarial attack that focuses on modifying the
lightness of the images. The shape and color of the samples, which are crucial
to human perception, are barely influenced. To obtain adversarial examples with
high image quality, we craft a naturalness-aware regularization. To achieve
stronger transferability, we propose random initialization and non-stop attack
strategy in the attack procedure. We verify the effectiveness of ALA on two
popular datasets for different tasks (i.e., ImageNet for image classification
and Places-365 for scene recognition). The experiments show that the generated
adversarial examples have both strong transferability and high image quality.
Besides, the adversarial examples can also help to improve the standard trained
ResNet50 on defending lightness corruption.

  Data",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Contrastive learning has proven useful in many applications where access to
labelled data is limited. The lack of annotated data is particularly
problematic in medical image segmentation as it is difficult to have clinical
experts manually annotate large volumes of data such as cardiac structures in
ultrasound images of the heart. In this paper, We propose a self supervised
contrastive learning method to segment the left ventricle from echocardiography
when limited annotated images exist. Furthermore, we study the effect of
contrastive pretraining on two well-known segmentation networks, UNet and
DeepLabV3. Our results show that contrastive pretraining helps improve the
performance on left ventricle segmentation, particularly when annotated data is
scarce. We show how to achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art fully
supervised algorithms when we train our models in a self-supervised fashion
followed by fine-tuning on just 5\% of the data. We show that our solution
outperforms what is currently published on a large public dataset
(EchoNet-Dynamic) achieving a Dice score of 0.9252. We also compare the
performance of our solution on another smaller dataset (CAMUS) to demonstrate
the generalizability of our proposed solution. The code is available at

Mobile networks suffer from highly variable bandwidth, latency, and losses that

gaming framework to minimize the impact of network conditions on the user
experience. Nebula relies on an end-to-end distortion model adapting the video
source rate and the amount of frame-level redundancy based on the measured
network conditions. As a result, it minimizes the motion-to-photon (MTP)
latency while protecting the frames from losses. We fully implement Nebula and
evaluate its performance against the state of the art techniques and latest
research in real-time mobile cloud gaming transmission on a physical testbed
over emulated and real wireless networks. Nebula consistently balances MTP
latency (<140 ms) and visual quality (>31 dB) even in highly variable
environments. A user experiment confirms that Nebula maximizes the user
experience with high perceived video quality, playability, and low user load.

real-world knowledge graphs, which widely suffer from incompleteness. KGC
methods assume a knowledge graph is static, but that may lead to inaccurate
prediction results because many facts in the knowledge graphs change over time.
Recently, emerging methods have shown improved predictive results by further
incorporating the timestamps of facts; namely, temporal knowledge graph
completion (TKGC). With this temporal information, TKGC methods can learn the
dynamic evolution of the knowledge graph that KGC methods fail to capture. In
this paper, for the first time, we summarize the recent advances in TKGC
research. First, we detail the background of TKGC, including the problem
definition, benchmark datasets, and evaluation metrics. Then, we summarize
existing TKGC methods based on how timestamps of facts are used to capture the
temporal dynamics. Finally, we conclude the paper and present future research

1T-TaS$_2$ crystals to produce fillers with nm-scale thickness and um-scale
lateral dimensions. Exfoliated 1T-TaS$_2$ was dispersed in a mixture of
isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol to allow fine-tuning of their

electrical and current fluctuation measurements of printed thin films
demonstrated that the charge-density-wave properties of 1T-TaS$_2$ are
preserved after processing. The functionality of the printed thin-film devices
can be defined by the nearly-commensurate to commensurate charge-density-wave
phase transition of individual exfoliated 1T-TaS$_2$ fillers rather than by
electron-hopping transport between them. These results provide pathways for the
development of printed electronics with diverse functionality achieved by the
incorporation of quasi-two-dimensional van der Waals quantum materials.

  Detection Using Robust Delay Analysis","17 pages, 10 figures, 3 algorithms",,,,"cs.AR cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Many fabless semiconductor companies outsource their designs to third-party
fabrication houses. As trustworthiness of chain after outsourcing including
fabrication houses is not established, any adversary in between, with malicious
intent may tamper the design by inserting Hardware Trojans (HTs). Detection of
such HTs is of utmost importance to assure the trust and integrity of the
chips. However, the efficiency of detection techniques based on side-channel
analysis is largely affected by process variations. In this paper, a
methodology for detecting HTs by analyzing the delays of topologically
symmetric paths is proposed. The proposed technique, rather than depending on
golden ICs as a reference for HT detection, employs the concept of
self-referencing. In this work, the fact that delays of topologically symmetric
paths in an IC will be affected similarly by process variations is exploited. A
procedure to chose topologically symmetric paths that are minimally affected by
process variations is presented. Further, a technique is proposed to create
topologically symmetric paths by inserting extra logic gates if such paths do
not exist in the design intrinsically. Simulations performed on ISCAS-85
benchmarks establish that the proposed method is able to achieve a true
positive rate of 100% with a false positive rate less than 3%. In our
experimentation, We have considered the maximum of 15% intra-die and 20%
inter-die variations in threshold voltage (Vth).

discovery as well as drug repurposing. Machine learning is commonly used in
drug-target affinity (DTA) problem. However, machine learning model faces the
cold-start problem where the model performance drops when predicting the
interaction of a novel drug or target. Previous works try to solve the cold
start problem by learning the drug or target representation using unsupervised
learning. While the drug or target representation can be learned in an
unsupervised manner, it still lacks the interaction information, which is
critical in drug-target interaction. Results: To incorporate the interaction
information into the drug and protein interaction, we proposed using transfer
learning from chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) and protein-protein
interaction (PPI) task to drug-target interaction task. The representation
learned by CCI and PPI tasks can be transferred smoothly to the DTA task due to
the similar nature of the tasks. The result on the drug-target affinity
datasets shows that our proposed method has advantages compared to other
pretraining methods in the DTA task.

CoV-2) compared to SARS Covid (2003 CoV) and MERS Covid (2012 MERS) can be
attributed to mutations reported in structural proteins, and the role played by
non-structural proteins (nsps) and accessory proteins (ORFs) for viral
replication, assembly, and shedding. Envelope protein E is one of the four
structural proteins of minimum length. Recent studies have confirmed critical
role played by the envelope protein in the viral life cycle including assembly
of virion exported from infected cell for its transmission. However, the
determinants of the highly complex viral - host interactions of envelope
protein, particularly with host Golgi complex, have not been adequately
characterized. CoV-2 and CoV Envelope proteins of length 75 and 76 amino acids
differ in four amino acid locations. The additional amino acid Gly (G) at
location 70 makes CoV length 76. The amino acid pair EG at location 69-70 of
CoV in place of amino acid R in location 69 of CoV-2, has been identified as a
major determining factor in the current investigation. This paper concentrates
on the design of computational model to compare the structure/function of wild
and mutants of CoV-2 with wild and mutants of CoV in the functionally important
region of the protein chain pair. We hypothesize that differences of CAML model
parameter of CoV-2 and CoV characterize the deviation in structure and function
of envelope proteins in respect of interaction of virus with host Golgi
complex; and this difference gets reflected in the difference of their
transmissibility. The hypothesis has been validated from single point
mutational study on- (i) human HBB beta-globin hemoglobin protein associated
with sickle cell anemia, (ii) mutants of envelope protein of Covid-2 infected
patients reported in recent publications.
