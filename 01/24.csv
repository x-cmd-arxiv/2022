multiple expansion formulas for infinite products. As applications, we deduce
an $A_{n}$ Rogers' $\text{}_{6}\phi_{5}$ summation, an $A_{n}$ extension of
Sylvester's identity, some multiple expansion formulas for

has been found that data prefer the present value of the equation of state of
the dark energy to be in the phantom domain. One interesting outcome of this
analysis is that although the current value of the dark energy equation of

information (CSI) of wireless signals in an indoor environment. These changes
in the CSI signals can be used for human activity recognition (HAR), which is a
predominant and unique approach due to preserving privacy and flexibility of
capturing motions in non-line-of-sight environments. Existing models for HAR
generally have a high computational complexity, contain very large number of

which has a linear computational complexity and is very fast. LiteHAR is
evaluated on a public benchmark dataset and the results show its high
classification performance in comparison with the complex deep learning models

evolved a diversity of body plans, from short-bodied and fully-limbed to
elongate and nearly limbless. Such diversity in body morphology is hypothesized
as adaptations to locomotion cluttered terrestrial environments, but the mode
of propulsion -- e.g., the use of body and/or limbs to interact with the
substrate -- and potential body/limb coordination remain unstudied. Here, we
use biological experiments, a geometric theory of locomotion, and robophysical
experiments to comparatively and systematically investigate such dynamics in a
diverse sample of lizard morphologies. Locomotor field studies in short-limb,
elongated lizards (Brachymeles) and laboratory studies of full-limbed lizards
(Uma scoparia and Sceloporus olivaceus) and a limbless laterally undulating
organism (Chionactis occipitalis) reveal that the body wave dynamics can be
described by a combination of traveling and standing waves; the ratio of the
amplitudes of these components is inversely related to limb length. We use
geometric theory to analyze and explain the wave dynamics and body-leg
coordination observations; the theory predicts that leg thrust modulates the
body weight distribution and self-propulsion generation mechanism, which in
turn facilitates the choice of body waves. We test our hypothesis in biological
experiments by inducing the use of traveling wave in stereotyped lizards by
modulating the ground penetration resistance, as well as in controlled
non-biological experiments involving an undulating limbed robophysical model.
Our models could be valuable in understanding functional constraints on the
evolutionary process of elongation and limb reduction in lizards, as well as
advancing robot designs.

technique, non-decimated wavelet transform (NDWT)-based scaling estimation,
that improves scaling parameter estimation over the traditional methods. One
distinctive feature of NDWT is that it does not decimate wavelet coefficients
at multiscale levels resulting in redundant outputs which are used to lower the
variance of scaling estimators. Another interesting feature of the proposed
methodology is the freedom of dyadic constraints for inputs, typical for
standard wavelet-based approaches. To compare the estimation performance of the
NDWT method to a conventional orthogonal wavelet transform-based method, we use
simulation to estimate the Hurst exponent in two-dimensional fractional
Brownian fields. The results of the simulation show that the proposed method
improves the conventional estimators of scaling and yields estimators with
smaller mean-squared errors. We apply the NDWT method to classification of
mammograms as cancer or control and, for publicly available mammogram images
from the database at the University of South Florida, find the the diagnostic
accuracy in excess of 80%.

the photo-bolometric effect, as directly observed and measured using scanning

heating at the junctions where a plasmonic field enhancement is possible. The
local heating of the Ag NWs results in negative photoconductance due to the
bolometric effect. Here an open-circuit response due to the plasmon-enhanced
Seebeck effect was recorded at the NW-metal contact junctions. The SPP-assisted
bolometric effect is found to be further enhanced by decorating the Ag NWs with
Ag nanoparticles. These observations are relevant to the use of metallic

scarcity of available training data. This work focuses on image reconstruction
in such settings, i.e., when both the number of available CT projections and
the training data is extremely limited. We adopt a sequential reconstruction
approach over several stages using an adversarially trained shallow network for
'destreaking' followed by a data-consistency update in each stage. To deal with
the challenge of limited data, we use image subvolumes to train our method, and
patch aggregation during testing. To deal with the computational challenge of
learning on 3D datasets for 3D reconstruction, we use a hybrid 3D-to-2D mapping
network for the 'destreaking' part. Comparisons to other methods over several

1289-1317] to compute the partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) with
initial singularity. We obtain the sharp error estimate under a mild
restriction condition of adjacent time-step ratios $r_{k}: =\tau_{k}/\tau_{k-1}
\; (k\geq 3) < r_{\max} = 4.8645 $ and a much mild requirement on the first
ratio, i.e., $r_2>0$. This leads to the validation of our analysis of the
variable time-step IMEX BDF2 scheme when the initial singularity is dealt by a
simple strategy, i.e., the graded mesh $t_k=T(k/N)^{\gamma}$. In this
situation, the convergence of order $\mathcal{O}(N^{-\min\{2,\gamma \alpha\}})$
is achieved with $N$ and $\alpha$ respectively representing the total mesh
points and indicating the regularity of the exact solution. This is, the
optical convergence will be achieved by taking $\gamma_{\text{opt}}=2/\alpha$.

highly non-uniform distribution of lower ionization state species accompanied
by more widespread higher ionization state material. This suggests that the CGM
is a dynamic, multiphase medium, such as arises in the presence of turbulence.
To better understand this evolution, we perform hydrodynamic and
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the CGM surrounding Milky Way-like
galaxies. In both cases, the CGM is initially in hydrostatic balance in a
$10^{12}$ solar masses dark matter gravitational potential, and the simulations
include rotation in the inner halo and turbulence that decreases radially. They
also track ionizations, recombinations, and species-by-species radiative
cooling in the presence of the redshift-zero UV background, employing the
MAIHEM non-equilibrium chemistry package. We find that after 9 Gyrs of
evolution, the presence of a magnetic field leads to an overall hotter CGM,
with cool gas in the center where magnetic pressure dominates. While the
non-MHD run produces more cold clouds overall, we find similar Si IV/O VI and N
V/O VI ratios between the MHD and non-MHD runs, which are both very different
from their equilibrium values. The non-MHD halo develops cool, low angular
momentum filaments above the central disk, in comparison to the MHD run that
has more efficient angular momentum transport, especially for the cold gas
which forms a more ordered and extended disk late into its evolution.

the inadequacy of Vanilla Transformer for graph representation learning. To

evidence for shock ionisation in the outer edges. We estimate shock velocities
to be in the $\approx160-180$\,km/s range based on the line ratios. This
suggests that an average and continuous outflow power of $\sim(2-4.5) \times

the kinematics of the bubble strongly suggest that the bubble is being inflated

high-resolution velocity models from seismic data. Typically, the velocity
model in its discrete form is represented on a rectangular grid, and we solve
for the elastic properties at these grid points. FWI is mostly solved employing
a local optimization method, where one obtains a velocity update by minimizing
the misfit between the observed and the calculated seismograms. Note also that
FWI is a highly non-linear problem which is known to be prone to
non-uniqueness. The convergence to a globally optimum solution is not
guaranteed; it depends on the choice of the starting model. Thus, a Bayesian
formulation of the inverse problem with subsequent sampling of the posterior
distribution is a preferred choice, since it enables uncertainty
quantification. However, with the increase in the dimension of a model,
sampling search space becomes computationally expensive. We employ a recently
developed trans-dimensional sampling method called Reversible Jump Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (RJHMC), to the 2D full waveform inversion problem. We represent
our velocity model using Voronoi cells, determined from the distribution of
certain nuclei points in the model space. This method offers two advantages.
First, it solves for a variable dimensional velocity updates by using a
trans-dimensional reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) step and
thus tries to achieve an optimum number of nuclei to represent the model and
minimize the misfit. A smaller number of parameters helps in an efficient
sampling of the model search space. Second, it applies the gradient-based
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) step, which further improves the sampling by
allowing the algorithm to take a large step guided by the gradient. This
two-step algorithm proves to be a useful tool for model exploration and
uncertainty quantification in FWI.

  -- extended version","The proof for finite throughput was removed",,,,"cs.RO cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A robotic swarm may encounter traffic congestion when many robots
simultaneously attempt to reach the same area. For solving that efficiently,
robots must execute decentralised traffic control algorithms. In this work, we
propose a measure for evaluating the access efficiency of a common target area
as the number of robots in the swarm rises: the common target area throughput.
We also employ here the target area asymptotic throughput -- that is, the
throughput of a target region with a limited area as the time tends to infinity
-- because it is always finite as the number of robots grows, opposed to the
relation arrival time at the target per number of robots that tends to
infinity. Using this measure, we can analytically compare the effectiveness of
different algorithms. In particular, we propose and formally evaluate three
different theoretical strategies for getting to a circular target area: (i)
forming parallel queues towards the target area, (ii) forming a hexagonal
packing through a corridor going to the target, and (iii) making multiple
curved trajectories towards the boundary of the target area. We calculate the
throughput for a fixed time and the asymptotic throughput for these strategies.
Additionally, we corroborate these results by simulations, showing that when a
strategy has higher throughput, its arrival time per number of robots is lower.
Thus, we conclude that using throughput is well suited for comparing congestion
algorithms for a common target area in robotic swarms even if we do not have
their closed asymptotic equation.

investigated numerically, focusing on highly inertial conditions under which
isolated bubbles follow non-straight paths. In an early stage, the second
bubble always drifts out of the wake of the leading one. Then, depending on the
ratios of the buoyancy, viscous and capillary forces which define the Galilei
($Ga$) and Bond ($Bo$) numbers of the system, five distinct regimes specific to
such conditions are identified, in which the two bubbles may rise independently
or continue to interact and possibly collide in the end. In the former case,
they usually perform large-amplitude planar zigzags within the same plane or
within two distinct planes, depending on the oblateness of the leading bubble.
However, for large enough $Ga$ and low enough $Bo$, they follow nearly vertical
paths with small-amplitude erratic horizontal deviations. Increasing $Bo$ makes
the wake-induced attraction toward the leading bubble stronger, forcing the two
bubbles to realign vertically one or more times along their ascent. During such
sequences, wake vortices may hit the trailing bubble, deflecting its path and,
depending on the case, promoting or hindering further possibilities of
interaction. In some regimes, varying the initial distance separating the two
bubbles modifies their lateral separation beyond the initial stage. Similarly,
minute initial angular deviations favour the selection of a single vertical
plane of rise common to both bubbles. These changes may dramatically affect the
fate of the tandem as, depending on $Bo$, they promote or prevent future
vertical realignments.

developed two novel algorithms for robots using artificial potential fields for

show that the proposed algorithms are bounded by the throughput of their
inspired theoretical strategies and compare the two novel algorithms with
state-of-art algorithms for the same problem (PCC, EE and PCC-EE). The SQF
algorithm significantly outperforms all other algorithms for a large number of
robots or when the circular target region radius is small. TRVF, on the other

only PCC for numerous robots. However, it allows us to analyse the potential

alternatively catalyzing the origin of life by delivering iron required to
create a reducing environment/atmosphere. We present 3D numerical simulations
of 1500-3400 km diameter impacts on the early Earth in order to quantify their
effects on planetary habitability. We find sterilizing impact events require
larger projectiles than previously assumed, with a 2000-2700 km diameter
impactor required to completely melt Earth's surface and an extrapolated >700
km diameter impactor required for ocean-vaporization. We also find that
reducing environments are less likely to arise following large impacts than
previously suggested, because >70% of the projectile iron is deposited in the
crust and upper mantle where it is not immediately available to reduce surface
water and contribute to forming a reducing atmosphere. Although the largest
expected late accretion impacts (~1 lunar mass) delivered sufficient iron to
the atmosphere to have reduced an entire ocean mass of water, such impacts
would also have melted the entire surface, potentially sequestering condensing
iron that is not oxidized quickly. The hypothesis that life emerged in the
aftermath of large impacts requires an efficient mechanism of harnessing the
reducing power of iron sequestered in the crust/mantle, or an origin of life
pathway that operates in more weakly-reducing post-impact environments that
require smaller quantities of impact-delivered iron.

reduce variance observed across repeated measurements, but this can come at the
expense of introducing bias to the average expected outcome. We then conduct
three simple simulations that provide concrete examples of how bias may
manifest in everyday situations. These simulations reveal several findings that
may be surprising and counterintuitive: (i) different methods can be equally
effective at reducing variance but some incur bias while others do not, (ii)
identifying methods that better recover ground truth does not guarantee the
absence of bias, (iii) bias can arise even if one has specific knowledge of
properties of the signal of interest. We suggest that researchers should
consider and possibly quantify bias before deploying denoising methods on

perturbation expectation maximization (pEMv2) [Physical Review E 94, 052412

catastrophic impact on peoples lives, is the effective screening of patients

one of the promising screening approaches. Many studies reported detecting
COVID-19 in chest X-rays accurately using deep learning. A serious limitation
of many published approaches is insufficient attention paid to explaining
decisions made by deep learning models. Using explainable artificial
intelligence methods, we demonstrate that model decisions may rely on
confounding factors rather than medical pathology. After an analysis of
potential confounding factors found on chest X-ray images, we propose a novel
method to minimise their negative impact. We show that our proposed method is
more robust than previous attempts to counter confounding factors such as ECG
leads in chest X-rays that often influence model classification decisions. In

underlying biological mechanisms is critical across many disease domains,
especially cancer. In translational oncology research, preclinical systems such
as patient-derived xenografts (PDX) have emerged as a unique study design
evaluating multiple treatments administered to samples from the same human
tumor implanted into genetically identical mice. In this paper, we propose a
novel Bayesian probabilistic tree-based framework for PDX data to investigate
the hierarchical relationships between treatments by inferring treatment
cluster trees, referred to as treatment trees (Rx-tree). The framework
motivates a new metric of mechanistic similarity between two or more treatments
accounting for inherent uncertainty in tree estimation; treatments with a high
estimated similarity have potentially high mechanistic synergy. Building upon
Dirichlet Diffusion Trees, we derive a closed-form marginal likelihood encoding
the tree structure, which facilitates computationally efficient posterior
inference via a new two-stage algorithm. Simulation studies demonstrate
superior performance of the proposed method in recovering the tree structure
and treatment similarities. Our analyses of a recently collated PDX dataset
produce treatment similarity estimates that show a high degree of concordance
with known biological mechanisms across treatments in five different cancers.
More importantly, we uncover new and potentially effective combination
therapies that confer synergistic regulation of specific downstream biological
pathways for future clinical investigations. Our accompanying code, data, and

impact. This goal implies a non-trivial optimization problem; lead service
lines connect water mains to individual houses, but any realistic replacement
strategy must batch replacements at a larger scale. Additionally, planners
typically lack a principled method for comparing the relative public health
value of potential interventions and often plan projects based on non-health
factors. This paper describes a simple process for estimating child health
impact at a parcel level by cleaning and synthesizing municipal datasets that
are commonly available but seldom joined due to data quality issues. Using
geocoding as the core record linkage mechanism, parcel-level toxicity data can
be combined with school enrollment records to indicate where young children and
lead lines coexist. A harm metric of estimated exposure-years is described at
the parcel level, which can then be aggregated to the project level and
minimized globally by posing project selection as a 0/1 knapsack problem.
Simplifying further for use by non-experts, the implied linear programming
relaxation is solved intuitively with the greedy algorithm; ordering projects
by benefit cost ratio produces a priority list which planners can then consider
holistically alongside harder to quantify factors. A case study demonstrates
the successful application of this framework to a small U.S. city's existing
data to prioritize federal infrastructure funding. While this paper focuses on
lead in drinking water, the approach readily generalizes to other sources of
residential toxicity with disproportionate impact on children.

of particles for improved convergence. In the second approach, we approximate
our model with a random walk phase model, followed by a phase tracking

lower bounds for all considered Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values. Numerical
results (of bit error rate (BER) and the mean-square error (MSE) of parameter

experimentally in optics, their study remains challenging leaving a number of
open questions unsolved. Among them, the impact on Anderson localization of
non-Hermiticity, optical gain and loss, and more generally, nonlinearities has
been the subject of numerous theoretical debates, without yet any conclusive
experimental demonstration. Indeed, in systems where localized modes have
reasonable spatial extension to be observed and investigated, their mutual
interaction and coupling to the sample boundaries make it extremely difficult
to isolate them spectrally and investigate them alone. Recently, we
successfully exhibited localized lasing modes individually in an active
disordered medium, using pump-shaping optimization technique. However, a
one-to-one identification of the lasing modes with the eigenmodes of the
passive system was not possible, as the impact of non-Hermiticity and nonlinear
gain on these localized states was unknown. Here, we apply the pump-shaping
method to fully control the non-Hermiticity of an active scattering medium.
  Direct imaging of the light distribution within the random laser allows us to
demonstrate unequivocally that the localized lasing modes are indeed the modes
of the passive system. This opens the way to investigate the robustness of
localized states in the presence of nonlinear gain and nonlinear modal
interactions. We show that, surprisingly, gain saturation and mode competition
for gain does not affect the spatial distribution of the modes.

the detection probability of data deception attacks at the expense of increased

turn reduces the control cost. We model the system as a stochastic optimal

detection delay (ADD) for fixed upper bounds on false alarm rate (FAR) and
increased control cost. The optimal solution results in a two threshold policy
on the posterior probability of attack, which is derived from the Shiryaev
statistics for sequential change detection assuming the change point is a
random variable with a geometric distribution. We derive approximate
expressions of ADD and FAR applying the non-linear renewal theory. The
relationship between the average number of watermarking added before the attack
and the increase in control cost is also derived. We design the optimal
watermarking that maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence for a fixed
increase in the control cost. Simulation studies are performed to illustrate
and validate the theoretical results.

Detection models may yield totally different performances with different label

samples are divided by the IoU threshold. Early object detectors simply utilize
the fixed threshold for all training samples, while recent detection algorithms

  In this paper, we seek to ensure private graph learning on a decentralized

with formal privacy guarantees based on edge local differential privacy. The
crux of {\em Solitude} is a set of new delicate mechanisms that can calibrate
the introduced noise in the decentralized graph collected from the users. The
principle behind the calibration is the intrinsic properties shared by many
real-world graphs, such as sparsity. Unlike existing work on locally private
GNNs, our new framework can simultaneously protect node feature privacy and
edge privacy, and can seamlessly incorporate with any GNN with privacy-utility
guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmarking datasets show that {\em

structure was applied. We compared our proposed GAN based transformers,
standalone Swin transformer and other convolutional neural networks based GAN

($\Sigma$) in a consistent way. These profiles were then fit with a pure
diffusion model that was tested on Crab, 3C 58 and G21.5$-$0.9 before. In
addition to the spectral softening due to the diffusion, we calculated the
synchrotron power and built up the theoretical surface brightness profile. For
each source, we performed separate fits to the $\Gamma$ and the $\Sigma$
profiles. We found these two profiles of most PWNe are similar, except for Crab

diffusion dominates the particle transport in most sampled PWNe. The
discrepancy of parameters between the $\Gamma$ profile and $\Sigma$ profiles is
relatively large for 3C 58 and G54.1+0.3. This difference could be attributed
to the elongated shape, reflecting boundary, and the non-uniform magnetic
field. Finally, we found no significant correlations between diffusion

large training sets. However, the synthetic training data has different styles

assessment and the document cross-domain analysis into a unified framework. Our
framework is composed of three components, Document Layout Generator (GLD),
Document Elements Decorator(GED), and Document Style Discriminator(DSD). The
GLD is used to document layout generates, the GED is used to document layout
elements fill, and the DSD is used to document quality assessment and
cross-domain guidance. First, we apply GLD to predict the positions of the

2.6$\times$10$^{34}$ erg and white-light flare duration 2.2 hr are much larger

profile shows no significant line asymmetry, meaning no signature of a filament
eruption, unlike the only previous detection of a superflare on this star
(Namekata et al. 2021, $Nat.Astron$). Also, it did not show significant line
broadening, indicating that the non-thermal heating at the flare footpoints are
not essential or that the footpoints are behind the limb. The time evolution
and duration of the H$\alpha$ flare are surprisingly almost the same as those
of the white-light flare, which is different from general M-dwarf
(super-)flares and solar flares. This unexpected time evolution may suggest
that different radiation mechanisms than general solar flares are predominant,
as follows: (1) radiation from (off-limb) flare loops, and (2) re-radiation via
radiative backwarming, in both of which the cooling timescales of flare loops
could determine the timescales of H$\alpha$ and white light.

obtaining a competitive automatic diagnosis model when a 3D convolution neural
network (CNN) brings more parameters and medical images are scarce remains
nontrivial and challenging. Considering both consistencies of regions of
interest in multimodal images and diagnostic accuracy, we propose a novel
mutual attention-based hybrid dimensional network for MultiModal 3D medical
image classification (MMNet). The hybrid dimensional network integrates 2D CNN
with 3D convolution modules to generate deeper and more informative feature
maps, and reduce the training complexity of 3D fusion. Besides, the pre-trained
model of ImageNet can be used in 2D CNN, which improves the performance of the
model. The stereoscopic attention is focused on building rich contextual
interdependencies of the region in 3D medical images. To improve the regional
correlation of pathological tissues in multimodal medical images, we further
design a mutual attention framework in the network to build the region-wise
consistency in similar stereoscopic regions of different image modalities,
providing an implicit manner to instruct the network to focus on pathological
tissues. MMNet outperforms many previous solutions and achieves results
competitive to the state-of-the-art on three multimodal imaging datasets, i.e.,
Parotid Gland Tumor (PGT) dataset, the MRNet dataset, and the PROSTATEx

variational auto-encoder based variability encoder (VAEVE) to explicitly encode
such variability for dysarthric speech. The VAEVE makes use of both phoneme
information and low-dimensional latent variable to reconstruct the input
acoustic features, thereby the latent variable is forced to encode the
phoneme-independent variability. Stochastic gradient variational Bayes
algorithm is applied to model the distribution for generating variability
encodings, which are further used as auxiliary features for DNN acoustic
modeling. Experiment results conducted on the UASpeech corpus show that the
VAEVE based variability encodings have complementary effect to the learning
hidden unit contributions (LHUC) speaker adaptation. The systems using
variability encodings consistently outperform the comparable baseline systems
without using them, and"" obtain absolute word error rate (WER) reduction by up

shows that post-processing causes disparate impacts on individuals or groups

the allocation of funds informed by US Census data. In the first setting, the
paper proposes tight bounds on the unfairness of traditional post-processing

two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions (DFs), the gapless and spin-helical
nature of which yields many exotic phenomena, such as the immunity of
topological surface states (TSS) to back-scattering. This leads to their high
transmission through surface defects or potential barriers. Quantum corrals,
previously elaborated on metal surfaces, can act as nanometer-sized electronic
resonators to trap Schr\""odinger electrons by quantum confinement. It is thus
intriguing, concerning their peculiar nature, to put the Dirac electrons of TSS
to the test in similar circumstances. Here, we report the behaviors of TSS in a
triangular quantum corral (TQC) fabricated by epitaxially growing Bi bilayer
nanostructures on the surfaces of Bi2Te3 films. Unlike a circular corral, the
TQC is supposed to be totally transparent for DFs. By mapping the electronic
structure of TSS inside TQCs through a low-temperature scanning tunneling
microscope in the real space, both the trapping and de-trapping behaviors of
the TSS electrons are observed. The selection rules are found to be governed by
the geometry and spin texture of the constant energy contour of TSS upon the
strong hexagonal warping in Bi2Te3. Careful analysis of the quantum
interference patterns of quasi-bound states yields the corresponding wave
vectors of trapped TSS, through which two trapping mechanisms favoring momenta
in different directions are uncovered. Our work indicates the extended nature
of TSS and elucidates the selection rules of the trapping of TSS in the
presence of a complicated surface state structure, giving insights into the
effective engineering of DFs in TIs.

functions (CBFs) which enforce safety-constraints over the entire duration of a

enforces safety only for a finite time of interest to the user. While
traditional CBF designs would keep the system away from the barrier longer than
necessary, our PTSf design lets the system reach the barrier by the prescribed
time and obey the operator's intent thereafter. To emphasize the capability of
our design for safety constraints with high relative degrees, we focus our
exposition on a chain of integrators where the safety condition is defined for
the state furthest from the control input. In contrast to existing CBF-based
methods for high-relative degree constraints, our approach involves choosing
explicitly specified gains (instead of class $\mathcal{K}$ functions), and,
with the aid of backstepping, operates in the entirety of the original safe set
with no additional restriction on the initial conditions. With Quadratic
Programming (QP) being employed in the design, in addition to backstepping and
CBFs with a PTSf property, we refer to our design as a QP-backstepping PT-CBF

and videos, due to large local redundancy and complex global dependency in
these visual data. Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers
(ViTs) have been two dominant frameworks in the past few years. Though CNNs can
efficiently decrease local redundancy by convolution within a small
neighborhood, the limited receptive field makes it hard to capture global
dependency. Alternatively, ViTs can effectively capture long-range dependency
via self-attention, while blind similarity comparisons among all the tokens
lead to high redundancy. To resolve these problems, we propose a novel Unified
transFormer (UniFormer), which can seamlessly integrate the merits of
convolution and self-attention in a concise transformer format. Different from
the typical transformer blocks, the relation aggregators in our UniFormer block
are equipped with local and global token affinity respectively in shallow and
deep layers, allowing to tackle both redundancy and dependency for efficient
and effective representation learning. Finally, we flexibly stack our UniFormer
blocks into a new powerful backbone, and adopt it for various vision tasks from
image to video domain, from classification to dense prediction. Without any
extra training data, our UniFormer achieves 86.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K
classification. With only ImageNet-1K pre-training, it can simply achieve
state-of-the-art performance in a broad range of downstream tasks, e.g., it
obtains 82.9/84.8 top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400/600, 60.9/71.2 top-1 accuracy

its associated symptoms. In this paper, we propose a model for passively
detecting mental disorders using conversations on Reddit. Specifically, we
focus on a subset of mental disorders that are characterized by distinct
emotional patterns (henceforth called emotional disorders): major depressive,
anxiety, and bipolar disorders. Through passive (i.e., unprompted) detection,
we can encourage patients to seek diagnosis and treatment for mental disorders.
Our proposed model is different from other work in this area in that our model
is based entirely on the emotional states, and the transition between these
states of users on Reddit, whereas prior work is typically based on
content-based representations (e.g., n-grams, language model embeddings, etc).
We show that content-based representation is affected by domain and topic bias
and thus does not generalize, while our model, on the other hand, suppresses
topic-specific information and thus generalizes well across different topics
and times. We conduct experiments on our model's ability to detect different
emotional disorders and on the generalizability of our model. Our experiments
show that while our model performs comparably to content-based models, such as
BERT, it generalizes much better across time and topic.

distributed adaptive control algorithms for linearly parameterized multi-agent

shocks. Then, under the undirected connected communication topology, all the
signals of the closed-loop systems are proved to be bounded and asymptotically
convergent. Finally, two comparative numerical simulation examples are carried

growth in demand, both in terms of the number of devices and Quality of Service

The primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict
boundary between the layers of the traditional Open Systems Interconnection
(OSI) protocol stack. The initial decade focused on establishing the
theoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging the
effectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent of
software defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to its
added flexibility. Yet, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions
designed in theory and ones deployed in practice. To establish this, we first
present an elaborate survey of the cross-layer protocol stack literature. Next,
we briefly discuss how a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), low SWaP (Size,
Weight, and Power) embedded SDR (e-SDR) was transformed into a standalone,
fieldable transceiver. Thereafter, we provide the software design ethos that
focuses on efficiency and flexibility such that the optimization objectives and
cross-layer interactions can be reconfigured rapidly. To demonstrate our
claims, we provide results from extensive outdoor over-the-air experiments in
various settings with up to 10-node network topologies. The results from the
field trials demonstrate high reliability, throughput, and dynamic routing
capability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in literature,
a COTS e-SDR has been leveraged to successfully design a cross-layer optimized
transceiver that is capable of forming an ad hoc network that provides high

trajectory planning by range discretization. To improve the accuracy of
numerical integration, the range of entry trajectory is selected as the
independent variable rather than time or energy. A dilation factor is employed
to normalize the entry dynamics and integration interval of the performance
index so that the difficult free-final-time programming problem can be
converted to a fixed-final-range optimization problem. The bank angle rate with
respect to the range is introduced as the new control input in order to
decouple the control from the state and facilitate convexification of
constraints on the bank angle and its rate. The nonlinear bank angle rate
constraint is further relaxed into a linear one via inequality relaxation.
Moreover, the nonconvex minimum-time performance index is convexified by
regarding flight time as a state variable. Then, the Mars entry trajectory
planning problem can be formulated into the framework of convex programming
after linearization. By range discretization and successive convexification,
the reformulated Mars entry trajectory planning problem is transcribed into a
series of convex optimization sub-problems that can be sequentially solved
using the convex programming algorithm. The virtual control and adaptive
trust-region techniques are employed to improve the accuracy, robustness, and
computation efficiency of the algorithm. Numerical simulations with comparative
studies are presented to demonstrate the convergence performance and efficiency

descent (HPMD), for solving discounted, infinite horizon MDPs with finite state
and action spaces. HPMD performs a mirror descent type policy update with an
additional diminishing regularization term, and possesses several computational
properties that seem to be new in the literature. We first establish the global
linear convergence of HPMD instantiated with Kullback-Leibler divergence, for
both the optimality gap, and a weighted distance to the set of optimal
policies. Then local superlinear convergence is obtained for both quantities
without any assumption. With local acceleration and diminishing regularization,
we establish the first result among policy gradient methods on certifying and
characterizing the limiting policy, by showing, with a non-asymptotic
characterization, that the last-iterate policy converges to the unique optimal
policy with the maximal entropy. We then extend all the aforementioned results
to HPMD instantiated with a broad class of decomposable Bregman divergences,
demonstrating the generality of the these computational properties. As a by
product, we discover the finite-time exact convergence for some commonly used
Bregman divergences, implying the continuing convergence of HPMD to the
limiting policy even if the current policy is already optimal. Finally, we
develop a stochastic version of HPMD and establish similar convergence
properties. By exploiting the local acceleration, we show that for small
optimality gap, a better than $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\left|\mathcal{S}\right|

walking or running in a non-predefined environment that could easily damage the
actuators due to high stiffness. In recent years, the usages of passive,
compliant series elastic actuators (SEA) for driving humanoid's joints have
proved the capability in many aspects so far. However, despite being widely
applied in the biped robot research field, the stable control problem for a
humanoid powered by the SEAs, especially in the walking process, is still a
challenge. This paper proposes a model reference adaptive control (MRAC)
combined with the backstepping algorithm to deal with the parameter
uncertainties in a humanoid's lower limb driven by the SEA system. This is also
an extension of our previous research (Lanh et al.,2021). Firstly, a dynamic
model of SEA is obtained. Secondly, since there are unknown and uncertain
parameters in the SEA model, a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) is
employed to guarantee the robust performance of the humanoid's lower limb.
Finally, an experiment is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed controller and the SEA mechanism.

has discovered not only periodic signals by transiting exoplanets but also
episodic or quasi-periodic dimming around young stellar objects. The mechanisms
of the dimming of these objects, so-called ""dippers"", are thought to be related
to the property of the accretion or the structure of protoplanetary disks
especially in regions close to the host star. Recently, we have created the
catalog of dippers from the one year of TESS Full Frame Image (FFI) data. In
this paper, we report spectral features of four newly found dippers in that
catalog and show that they potentially shed light on the dimming mechanisms. We
found that all of the targets exhibit the H alpha emission line, which is an
indicator of an ongoing accretion. Based on its line profiles and/or their
variability, we characterized the properties of the disks of each source, which
can support the dimming mechanisms due to a dusty disk wind or an accretion
warp. Also, we found an interesting dipper (TIC 317873721), ""close-in binary
dipper,"" showing the complex variability of the line profile and the large
radial velocity variation. Since the dimming intervals are similar to the
orbital period of the binary, we suggest that the dips are caused by dust in
the warp of accretion from a circumbinary disk onto stars. Such a close-in ($<$
0.1 au) binary dipper is rarely reported so far, further investigation will
reveal the new aspect of the disk evolution and planetary formation.

authentic perception information based on high-fidelity sensors via a
cost-effective platform is crucial for enabling CDA-related research, e.g.,
cooperative decision-making or control. Most state-of-the-art traffic
simulation studies for CAVs rely on situation-awareness information by directly
calling on intrinsic attributes of the objects, which impedes the reliability
and fidelity of the assessment of CDA algorithms. In this study, a
\textit{Cyber Mobility Mirror (CMM)} Co-Simulation Platform is designed for
enabling CDA by providing authentic perception information. The \textit{CMM}
Co-Simulation Platform can emulate the real world with a high-fidelity sensor
perception system and a cyber world with a real-time rebuilding system acting
as a ""\textit{Mirror}"" of the real-world environment. Concretely, the
real-world simulator is mainly in charge of simulating the traffic environment,
sensors, as well as the authentic perception process. The mirror-world

problem with significant practical importance. One promising approach is to
first construct graphs approximating the spaces, called roadmaps, and then
apply multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) algorithms to derive a set of
conflict-free paths. While conventional studies have utilized roadmap
construction methods developed for single-agent planning, it remains largely
unexplored how we can construct roadmaps that work effectively for multiple
agents. To this end, we propose a novel concept of roadmaps called cooperative
timed roadmaps (CTRMs). CTRMs enable each agent to focus on its important
locations around potential solution paths in a way that considers the behavior
of other agents to avoid inter-agent collisions (i.e., ""cooperative""), while
being augmented in the time direction to make it easy to derive a ""timed""
solution path. To construct CTRMs, we developed a machine-learning approach
that learns a generative model from a collection of relevant problem instances
and plausible solutions and then uses the learned model to sample the vertices
of CTRMs for new, previously unseen problem instances. Our empirical evaluation
revealed that the use of CTRMs significantly reduced the planning effort with
acceptable overheads while maintaining a success rate and solution quality
comparable to conventional roadmap construction approaches.

a system with open boundaries are dramatically different from those in momentum
space; the fact may even lead to the notion that momentum-space band structures

generalize the widely used radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure both real

for either bosonic or fermionic atoms. By weakly coupling the energy levels of
a non-Hermitian system to auxiliary energy levels, we theoretically derive a
formula showing that the decay of atoms on the auxiliary energy levels reflects
the real and imaginary parts of energy spectra in momentum space. We further
prove that measurement outcomes are independent of boundary conditions in the

Specifically, for a stack of two semi-infinite chains cycled in opposite

higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence that relates the bulk Chern number
associated with the adiabatic cycle of a single infinite chain and the number
of electrons transferred between the semi-infinite chains. The relation is
formulated using the relative index of two projections and proven using
K-theoretic calculations. The phenomenon is exemplified using the Rice-Mele

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) powered by supermassive black holes. The baryon
loading efficiency onto relativistic CR baryons from the accreting black holes
is poorly constrained by observations so far. In this paper, we suggest that
the $\gamma$-ray emission of galaxy clusters can be used to study the baryon
loading factor of AGN jets, since CRs injected by AGN jets are completely
confined in the galaxy clusters and sufficiently interact with intra-cluster
medium via hadronic process, producing diffuse $\gamma$-rays. We study the
propagation of CRs in the galaxy clusters and calculate the radial distribution
of the gamma-rays in the galaxy cluster with different injection rates from
AGNs. By comparison with the $\gamma$-ray flux and upper limits of the Coma
cluster measured by $Fermi$-LAT and VERITAS, we find the upper limit of the
average baryon loading factor {(defined as the efficiency with which the
gravitational energy is converted into relativistic particles)} to be $\eta_{p,
\mathrm{grav}} < 0.1$. The upper limit is much lower than that required to
account for diffuse neutrino flux in the conventional blazar models.

compute specific target functions without simple forms like obstacle detection,

transferring data to a central location either for training or inference place
enormous strain on network resources. To address this, we develop, to the best
of our knowledge, the first machine learning framework for distributed
functional compression over both the Gaussian Multiple Access Channel (GMAC)

theorem, our machine learning framework can, by design, compute any arbitrary
function for the desired functional compression task in IoT. Importantly the
raw sensory data are never transferred to a central node for training or
inference, thus reducing communication. For these algorithms, we provide
theoretical convergence guarantees and upper bounds on communication. Our
simulations show that the learned encoders and decoders for functional
compression perform significantly better than traditional approaches, are
robust to channel condition changes and sensor outages. Compared to the
cloud-based scenario, our algorithms reduce channel use by two orders of
magnitude.

efficiently using automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent,
and uncertainty quantification can be done straightforwardly via nonparametric

that normalizing flows present a flexible and straightforward way to model

depends on the architecture of the bijective map, which can be difficult to
establish in practice.

using spatial-temporal analysis on relatively long video clips, while falling
short in real-time forgery detection. The recent work correlates time-series

fine-grained forgery localization. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Secure-Pose, which exploits the pervasive coexistence of surveillance and Wi-Fi
infrastructures to defend against video forgery attacks in a real-time and
fine-grained manner. We observe that coexisting camera and Wi-Fi signals convey
common human semantic information and forgery attacks on video streams will
decouple such information correspondence. Particularly, retrievable human pose
features are first extracted from concurrent video and Wi-Fi channel state
information (CSI) streams. Then, a lightweight detection network is developed
to accurately discover forgery attacks and an efficient localization algorithm
is devised to seamlessly track forgery traces in video streams. We implement
Secure-Pose using one Logitech camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it
in different environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection accuracy of
98.7% and localizes abnormal objects under playback and tampering attacks.

understanding the fundamental patterns of human behavior. In these networks,
interactions occur locally between individuals (i.e., nodes) who connect with
each other at different times, culminating into a complex system-wide web that
has a dynamic composition. Dynamic behavior in networks occurs not only locally
but also at the global level, as systems expand or shrink due either to:
changes in the size of node population or variations in the chance of a
connection between two nodes. Here, we propose a numerical maximum-likelihood
method to estimate population size and the probability of two nodes connecting
at any given point in time. An advantage of the method is that it relies only
on aggregate quantities, which are easy to access and free from privacy issues.
Our approach enables us to identify the simultaneous (rather than the

learned the user's preferences and item's features with vectorized embeddings,
and modeled the user's general preferences to items by the interaction of them.
In fact, users have their specific preferences to item attributes and different
preferences are usually related. Therefore, exploring the fine-grained
preferences as well as modeling the relationships among user's different
preferences could improve the recommendation performance. Toward this end, we
propose a dual preference distribution learning framework (DUPLE), which aims
to jointly learn a general preference distribution and a specific preference
distribution for a given user, where the former corresponds to the user's
general preference to items and the latter refers to the user's specific
preference to item attributes. Notably, the mean vector of each Gaussian
distribution can capture the user's preferences, and the covariance matrix can
learn their relationship. Moreover, we can summarize a preferred attribute
profile for each user, depicting his/her preferred item attributes. We then can
provide the explanation for each recommended item by checking the overlap
between its attributes and the user's preferred attribute profile. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments on six public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and explainability of the DUPLE method.

phone/senone mapping, deep neural network (DNN) learns to map senones or phones
from one language to the others, and the transcriptions of the source languages
are modified such that they can be used along with the target language data to
train and fine-tune the target language ASR system. In the other approach, we
model the acoustic information for all the languages simultaneously by training
a multitask DNN (MTDNN) to predict the senones of each language in different
output layers. The cross-entropy loss and the weight update procedure are
modified such that only the shared layers and the output layer responsible for

E for droplets sliding down on liquid-infused surfaces by gravity. Furthermore,
our device achieves droplet velocity of 1 mm/s at the applied voltage of 15 V.
The velocity is approximately tenfold as high as the same condition (applied
voltage and oil viscosity) on porous-structure-based liquid-infused surfaces.
The achieved high velocity is explained by a lubrication-flow effect.

practice. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) using only limited target
statistics can be an alternative algorithm in which the training and testing of
the model are conducted in the same LES environment. The DRL of turbulence
modeling remains challenging owing to its chaotic nature, high dimensionality
of the action space, and large computational cost. In the present study, we
propose a physics-constrained DRL framework that can develop a deep neural
network (DNN)-based SGS model for the LES of turbulent channel flow. The DRL
models that produce the SGS stress were trained based on the local gradient of
the filtered velocities. The developed SGS model automatically satisfies the
reflectional invariance and wall boundary conditions without an extra training
process so that DRL can quickly find the optimal policy. Furthermore, direct
accumulation of reward, spatially and temporally correlated exploration, and
the pre-training process are applied for the efficient and effective learning.
In various environments, our DRL could discover SGS models that produce the
viscous and Reynolds stress statistics perfectly consistent with the filtered
DNS. By comparing various statistics obtained by the trained models and
conventional SGS models, we present a possible interpretation of better
performance of the DRL model.

a new paradigm of cellular integrated sensing and communication (ISAC).
However, due to the intrinsic difference between sensing and communication in
terms of coverage requirement, current cellular networks that are deliberately
planned mainly for communication coverage are difficult to achieve seamless
sensing coverage. To address this issue, this paper studies the beamforming
optimization towards seamless sensing coverage for a basic bi-static ISAC
system, while ensuring that the communication requirements of multiple users

formulated to maximize the worst-case sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a
prescribed coverage region, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) requirement for each UE. To gain some insights, we first
investigate the special case with one single UE and one single sensing point,
for which a closed-from expression of the optimal beamforming is obtained. For
the general case with multiple communication UEs and contiguous regional
sensing coverage, an efficient algorithm based on successive convex
approximation (SCA) is proposed to solve the non-convex beamforming

able to achieve seamless sensing coverage in the prescribed region, while

$\omega_{H,T}(t)$ is a Gaussian process that can be considered as a stationary
version of an $H$-fractional Brownian motion. Moreover, when $H \to 0$, one has
$M_{H,T}(d t) \rightarrow {\widetilde M}_{T}(d t)$ (in the weak sense) where
${\widetilde M}_{T}(d t)$ is the celebrated log-normal multifractal random

framework, the two popular classes of multifractal ($H = 0$) and rough
volatility ($0<H < 1/2$) models. The main properties of the log S-fBM are
discussed and their estimation issues are addressed. We notably show that the
direct estimation of $H$ from the scaling properties of $\ln(M_{H,T}([t,

individual stocks are characterized by values of $H$ that can be very close to
$0$ and thus well described by a MRM. We also bring evidence that unlike the
log-volatility variance $\nu^2$ whose estimation appears to be poorly reliable
(though used widely in the rough volatility literature), the estimation of the
so-called ""intermittency coefficient"" $\lambda^2$, which is the product of
$\nu^2$ and the Hurst exponent $H$, appears to be far more reliable leading to
values that seem to be universal for respectively all individual stocks and all
stock indices.

particular, polarization entanglement, which is central to quantum photonics
due to the simplicity of polarization qubit encoding and control, is so far not
realized on flat platforms. Meanwhile, relaxed phase matching of flat nonlinear
optical sources enables enormous freedom in tailoring their polarization
properties. Here we use this freedom to generate photon pairs with tunable
polarization entanglement via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in
a $400$ nm GaP film. By changing the pump polarization, we tune the
polarization state of photon pairs from maximally entangled to almost
disentangled, which is impossible in a single bulk source of SPDC. Polarization
entanglement, in combination with the broadband frequency spectrum, results in
an ultranarrow (12 fs) Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and promises extensions to
hyperentanglement.

A deep neural network is trained in parallel on multiple tasks, where each task
is trained only on a subset of the network resources. Each subset consists of
network segments, that can be combined and shared across specific tasks. Tasks
can share resources with other tasks, while having independent task-related
network resources. Therefore, the trained network can share similar
representations across various tasks, while also enabling independent
task-related representations. The above allows for some crucial outcomes. (1)
The parallel nature of our approach negates the issue of catastrophic

efficiently. (3) We show that the network does indeed use learned knowledge
from some tasks in other tasks, through shared representations. (4) Through
examination of individual task-related and shared representations, the model
offers transparency in the network and in the relationships across tasks in a

non-convexity of the joint optimization problem, we transform the original
problem into a difference-of-convex (DC) form, which is then solved by the

Specifically, BAERASE mainly implements backdoor defense in two key steps.
First, trigger pattern recovery is conducted to extract the trigger patterns
infected by the victim model. Here, the trigger pattern recovery problem is
equivalent to the one of extracting an unknown noise distribution from the
victim model, which can be easily resolved by the entropy maximization based
generative model. Subsequently, BAERASE leverages these recovered trigger
patterns to reverse the backdoor injection procedure and induce the victim
model to erase the polluted memories through a newly designed gradient ascent
based machine unlearning method. Compared with the previous machine unlearning
solutions, the proposed approach gets rid of the reliance on the full access to
training data for retraining and shows higher effectiveness on backdoor erasing
than existing fine-tuning or pruning methods. Moreover, experiments show that
BAERASE can averagely lower the attack success rates of three kinds of
state-of-the-art backdoor attacks by 99\% on four benchmark datasets.

this situation, this paper proposes a distributed computational resource
trading strategy addressing multiple preferences of IoT users. Unlike most

different satisfaction degrees with task delay, energy consumption, price, and
user reputation of both requesters and collaborators. The system design uses
blockchain to enhance the decentralization, security, and automation. Compared
with the trading method based on classical double auction matching mechanism,
our trading strategy has more tasks offloaded and executed, and the trading

large-scale filaments using a dark matter-only cosmological simulation with the
help of a phase-space analysis. Since a non-negligible number of galaxies is
expected to fall into the cluster environment through large-scale filaments,
tracking how halos move around large-scale filaments can provide a more
comprehensive view on the evolution of cluster galaxies. Halos exhibit orbital
motions around filaments, which emerge as specific trajectories in a phase
space composed of halos' perpendicular distance and velocity component with
respect to filaments. These phase-space trajectories can be represented by
three cases according to their current states. We parameterize the trajectories
with halos' initial position and velocity, maximum velocity, formation time,
and time since first crossing, which are found to be correlated with each
other. These correlations are explained well in the context of the large-scale
structure formation. The mass evolution and dynamical properties of halos seem
to be affected by the density of filaments, which can be shown from the fact
that halos around denser filaments are more likely to lose their mass and be
bound within large-scale filaments. Finally we reproduce the mass segregation
trend around filaments found in observations. It is resulted because halos that
formed earlier arrived filaments earlier, and grew efficiently there being more
massive. We also found that dynamical friction helps to retain this segregation
trend.

dropped from impact heights ranging from 4 cm to 60 cm (splashing threshold 20

drop impacted the surface were labeled according to their outcome, splashing or
nonsplashing, and were used to train an FNN. A classification accuracy higher

classification, the weight matrix of the trained FNN for identifying splashing

identified the contour height of the main body of the impacting drop as an
important characteristic differentiating between splashing and nonsplashing
drops, which has not been reported in previous studies. This feature was found
throughout the impact, even when one and three-quarters of the drop impacted

retrained to classify using only the main body without checking for the
presence of ejected secondary droplets. The accuracy was still higher than 82%,
confirming that the contour height is an important feature distinguishing
splashing from nonsplashing drops. Several aspects of drop impact are analyzed
and discussed with the aim of identifying the possible mechanism underlying the
difference in contour height between splashing and nonsplashing drops.

automatically removes redundant and irrelevant results, without any artificial

associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from GW170817, neutron star--black
hole (NSBH) mergers have been highly expected to be the next type of
multi-messenger source. However, despite the detection of several of NSBH
merger candidates during the GW third observation run, no confirmed EM
counterparts from these sources have been identified. The most plausible
explanation is that these NSBH merger candidates were plunging events mainly
because the primary BHs had near-zero projected aligned-spins based on GW
observations. In view that NSs can be easily tidally disrupted by BHs with high
projected aligned-spins, we study an evolution channel to form NSBH binaries
with fast-spinning BHs, the properties of BH mass and spin, and their
associated tidal disruption probability. We find that if the NSs are born
firstly, the companion helium stars would be tidally spun up efficiently, and
would thus finally form fast-spinning BHs. If BHs do not receive significant
natal kicks at birth, these NSBH binaries that can merge within the Hubble time
would have BHs with the projected aligned-spins $\chi_{z}\gtrsim0.8$ and,
hence, can certainly allow tidal disruption to happen. Even if significant BH
kicks are considered for a small fraction of NSBH binaries, the projected
aligned-spins of BHs are $\chi_z\gtrsim0.2$. These systems can still be
disrupted events unless the NSs are very massive. Thus, NS-first-born NSBH
mergers would be promising multi-messenger sources. We discuss various
potential EM counterparts associated with these systems and their detectability
in the upcoming fourth observation run.

reveals that micrometric spheroids are most characteristic for ZnS and
(Zn,Cd)S, although the sulfides readily form pseudomorphs after different plant
tissues resulting in much larger aggregates. The aggregates have a complex
polycrystalline sphalerite structure much more advanced than typically obtained
during low-temperature synthesis or observed in other modern occurrences. Platy
highly-disordered radially-aggregated submicrometre crystals develop within the
time constraints of several decades in the cold (~15{\deg}C) and acid (pH
3.4-4.4) peat. The less abundant Pb sulfides occur as submicron cube-like
crystals between ZnS or as flat irregular or square patches on plant root
macrofossils. All PbS are crystalline and defect-free. Pb ion complexation with
dissolved and solid organic matter is probably responsible for the low number
and equilibrium shape of PbS crystals. Iron is absent in the authigenic sulfide
mineralization and occurs entirely as organically bound ferric iron (Fe3+), as
revealed by Mossbauer spectroscopy. The different affinity of metals to organic
matter enhances the precipitation of Zn and Cd as sulfides over Pb and Fe. Our
findings demonstrate that human activities lead to the formation of
near-surface stratiform metal sulfide accumulations in peat, and the polluted

difficult to study; in particular, the conjecture that $p_{\mathbf{u}}(n)$ can
be bounded only if $\mathbf{u}$ is ultimately periodic is open since 2013. A
more recent conjecture concerns the prefix palindromic length of the period
doubling word: it seems that it is not $2$-regular, and if it is true, this
would give a rare if not unique example of a non-regular function of a
$2$-automatic word.
  For some other $k$-automatic words, however, the prefix palindromic length is
known to be $k$-regular. Here we add to the list of those words the Sierpinski

energy/entropy in general relativity, recently proposed by a collaboration
including the present authors, with existing definitions of energies such as
the one from the pseudo-tensor and the quasi-local energy. We show that
existing definitions of energies in general relativity are conserved charges
from the Noether's 2nd theorem for the general coordinate transformation, whose
conservations are merely identities implied by the local symmetry and always
hold without using equations of motion. Thus none of existing definitions in
general relativity reflects the dynamical properties of the system, need for a
physical definition of an energy. In contrast, our new definition of the
energy/entropy in general relativity is generically a conserved non-Noether
charge and gives physically sensible results for various cases such as the
black hole mass, the gravitational collapse, and the expanding universe, while
existing definitions sometimes lead to unphysical ones including zero and
infinity. We conclude that our proposal is more physical than existing
definitions of energies. Our proposal makes it possible to define almost
uniquely the covariant and conserved energy/entropy in general relativity,
which brings some implications to future investigations.

that are valid in certain limits in zero order, such as small frequencies, wave
vectors and material fill fractions. In some cases they remain surprisingly
robust exceeding their initial assumptions, such as the well-established
Maxwell-Garnett theory for elliptical inclusions that can produce reliable
results for fill fractions far above its theoretical limitations. We here
present a rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations in binary periodic materials
employing a combined Greens-Galerkin procedure to obtain a low-dimensional
eigenproblem for the evanescent Floquet eigenmodes of the material. In its
general form, our method provides an accurate solution of the multi-valued
complex Floquet bandstructure, which currently cannot be obtained with
established solvers. It is thus shown to be valid in regimes where
homogenization theories naturally break down. For small frequencies and wave
numbers in lowest order, our method simplifies to the Maxwell-Garnett result
for 2D cylinder and 3D sphere packings. It therefore provides the missing
explanation why Maxwell-Garnett works well up to extremely high fill fractions
of approximately $50\%$ depending on the base materials, provided the
inclusions are arranged on an isotropic lattice.

prognosis depends on early diagnosis. Unfortunately, screening programs for the
early diagnosis of lung cancer are uncommon. This is in-part due to the at-risk
groups being located in rural areas far from medical facilities. Reaching these
populations would require a scaled approach that combines mobility, low cost,
speed, accuracy, and privacy. We can resolve these issues by combining the
chest X-ray imaging mode with a federated deep-learning approach, provided that
the federated model is trained on homogenous data to ensure that no single data
source can adversely bias the model at any point in time. In this study we show
that an image pre-processing pipeline that homogenizes and debiases chest X-ray
images can improve both internal classification and external generalization,
paving the way for a low-cost and accessible deep learning-based clinical
system for lung cancer screening. An evolutionary pruning mechanism is used to
train a nodule detection deep learning model on the most informative images
from a publicly available lung nodule X-ray dataset. Histogram equalization is
used to remove systematic differences in image brightness and contrast. Model
training is performed using all combinations of lung field segmentation, close
cropping, and rib suppression operators. We show that this pre-processing
pipeline results in deep learning models that successfully generalize an
independent lung nodule dataset using ablation studies to assess the
contribution of each operator in this pipeline. In stripping chest X-ray images
of known confounding variables by lung field segmentation, along with
suppression of signal noise from the bone structure we can train a highly
accurate deep learning lung nodule detection algorithm with outstanding
generalization accuracy of 89% to nodule samples in unseen data.

crucial role in direct dark matter searches. For low kinetic energies (below
$50~\mathrm{keV}$), IQF measurements deviate significantly from common models

parameters in the Zeeman laser model for three well known nonlinear sources of
instabilities, namely, quasiperiodic breakdown to chaos followed by interior
crisis, quasiperiodic intermittency, and Pomeau-Manneville intermittency.
Hyperchaos appears with a sudden expansion of the attractor of the system at a
critical parameter for each case and it coincides with triggering of occasional
and recurrent large-intensity pulses. The transition to hyperchaos from a
periodic orbit via Pomeau-Manneville intermittency shows hysteresis at the
critical point, while no hysteresis is recorded during the other two processes.
The recurrent large-intensity pulses show characteristic features of extremes
by their height larger than a threshold and probability of rare occurrence. The
phenomenon is robust to weak noise although the critical parameter of
transition to hyperchaos shifts with noise strength. This phenomenon appears as
common in many low dimensional systems as reported earlier, there the emergent
large-intensity events or extreme events dynamics have been recognized simply
as chaotic in nature although the temporal dynamics shows occasional large
deviations from the original chaotic state in many examples. We need a new
metric, in the future, that would be able to classify such significantly
different dynamics and distinguish from chaos.

Kepler observations for 3,642 solar-like oscillators on the red-giant branch

determine fundamental stellar parameters with good precision: the typical
uncertainty is 4.5% for mass, 16% for age, 0.006 dex for surface gravity, and
1.7% for radius. We also achieve good accuracy for estimated masses and radii,
based on comparing with those determined for eclipsing binaries. We find a
systematic offset of ~15% in mass and ~7% in radius between the modeling
solutions and the scaling relations. Further investigation indicates that these
offsets are mainly caused by a systematic bias in the Delta nu scaling
relation: the original scaling relation underestimates Delta nu value by ~4%,
on average, and it is important to correct for the surface term in the
calibration. We find no significant offset in the nu_max scaling relation,
although a clear metallicity dependence is seen and we suggest including a
metallicity term in the formulae. Lastly, we calibrate new scaling relations
for red-giant stars based on observed global seismic parameters, spectroscopic
effective temperatures and metallicities, and modeling-inferred masses and

resolved pulse profiles with a Fourier series of up to five harmonics. We
investigate relationships between the pulse profile properties and other
observables of the systems (e.g., orbital period, magnetic field strength, and
luminosity) to study the extreme physics of these systems. The sources were
divided into three groups by a classification based on the shape, the dominance
of the fitted Fourier harmonics and their respective evolution with energy. We
do not find a conclusive correlation between the pulse profile shapes or groups
and other parameters of the systems. However, a weak trend was found when
comparing our classification to the sources' location in the spin
period-orbital period diagram. Further studies are required to confirm this
trend. Despite the large variety of pulse profiles of the X-ray pulsars, we
found that with our approach clear categories emerge which we use to classify
their behavior as function of energy. As we do not find a clear relationship
between our classification scheme and other parameters we conclude that X-ray

be accelerated, these energetic particles are expected to interact with the
surrounding medium to produce a gamma-ray signal even in the multi--TeV range.
The intensity of this signal depends on various factors, but an essential one
is the density of the circumstellar medium. Such a signal should however be
limited by electron-positron pair production arising from the interaction of
the gamma-ray photons with optical photons emitted by the supernova
photosphere, which can potentially degrade the gamma-ray signal by over ten
orders of magnitude in the first days/weeks following the explosion. We
calculate the gamma-gamma opacity from a detailed modelling of the time
evolution of the forward shock and supernova photosphere, taking a full account
of the non-isotropy of the photon interactions. We discuss the time-dependent
gamma-ray TeV emission from type II-P SNe as a function of the stellar
progenitor radius and mass-loss rate, as well as the explosion energy and mass
of the ejected material. We evaluate the detectability of the SNe with the next
generation of Cherenkov telescopes. We find that, while most extragalactic
events may be undetectable, type II-P SNe exploding in our Galaxy or in the
Magellanic Clouds should be detected by gamma-ray observatories such as the

active person for each time frame by using a short spectral patch of just
hundreds of milliseconds. The model is applied to every time frame, and the
short time frame signals from the selected microphones are concatenated across
the frames to produce an output signal. As the personal devices are usually
held close to their owners, the output signal is expected to have higher
signal-to-noise and direct-to-reverberation ratios on average than the input
signals. Since PickNet utilizes only limited acoustic context at each time
frame, the system using the proposed model works in real time and is robust to
changes in acoustic conditions. Speech recognition-based evaluation was carried
out by using real conversational recordings obtained with various smartphones.

Titan represents a unique end-member to study the impact cratering process.
Unlike craters on other Saturnian satellites, Titan's craters are
preferentially located in high-elevation regions near the equator. This led to
the hypothesis that the presence of liquid methane in Titan's lowlands affects
crater morphology, making them difficult to identify. This is because surfaces
covered by weak fluid-saturated sediment limit the topographic expression of
impact craters, as sediment moves into the crater cavity shortly after
formation. Here we simulate crater-forming impacts on Titan's surface,
exploring how a methane-saturated layer overlying a methane-clathrate layer
affects crater formation. Our numerical results show that impacts form smaller
craters in a methane-clathrate basement than a water-ice basement, due to the
differences in strength. We find that the addition of a methane-saturated layer
atop this basement reduces crater depths and influences crater morphology. The
morphology of impact craters formed in a thin methane-saturated layer are
similar to those in a ""dry"" target, but a thick saturated layer produces an
impact structure with little to no topography. A thick methane-saturated layer
(thicker than 40% of the impactor diameter) could explain the dearth of craters
in the low-elevation regions on Titan.

is found to show unique features with the topological phase transitions driven
by paritytime( PT)-symmetric non-Hermitian discrete-time quantum walks as well
as by Hermitian ones, despite artificial boundaries are not constructed by
inhomogeneous quantum walk. For a Hermitian system, a turning point and abrupt
change appears in the diffusion coefficient when the system is approaching the
topological phase transition, while it remains stable in the trivial
topological state. For a non-Hermitian system, except for the feature
associated to the topological transition, the diffusion coefficient in the
PT-symmetric-broken phase demonstrates an abrupt change with a peak structure.
In addition, the Shannon entropy of the quantum walk is found to exhibit a
direct correlation with the diffusion coefficient. The numerical results

rely on human description. The use of instance-level human parsing (HP) is
therefore relevant since it localizes semantic attributes and body parts within
a person. But how to characterize these attributes? To our knowledge, only some
single-HP datasets describe attributes with some color, size and/or pattern
characteristics. There is a lack of dataset for multi-HP in the wild with such
characteristics. In this article, we propose the dataset CCIHP based on the
multi-HP dataset CIHP, with 20 new labels covering these 3 kinds of
characteristics. In addition, we propose HPTR, a new bottom-up multi-task
method based on transformers as a fast and scalable baseline. It is the fastest
method of multi-HP state of the art while having precision comparable to the
most precise bottom-up method. We hope this will encourage research for fast
and accurate methods of precise human descriptions.

follow the time variability of the polarization degree in the case of the shock
acceleration model. In the case of the magnetic reconnection model, the nominal
injected model provides the best fit of the simulated IXPE data for time bins
of 5-10 ks, depending on the tested flux level. For the TEMZ model, shorter
time slices of 0.5 ks are needed for obtaining a formally good fit of the
simulated IXPE data with the injected model. On the other hand, we find that a
fit with a constant model provides a $\chi^2$ lower than the fit with the
nominal injected model when using time slices of 20 ks, 60/70 ks, and 5 ks for

form outflows that can influence the accreted gas. The latter process, known as
mechanical feedback, can significantly affect the accretion rate. We use
hydrodynamical simulations to assess the impact of mechanical feedback on the
accretion rate when the BH moves supersonically through a uniform medium. We
carry out 3D hydrodynamical simulations of outflows fueled by accretion that
interact with a uniform medium, probing scales similar to and larger than the
accretor gravitational sphere of influence. In the simulations the accretor is
at rest and the medium moves at supersonic speeds. The outflow power is assumed
to be proportional to the accretion rate. The simulations are run for different
outflow-medium motion angles and velocity ratios. The impact of different
degrees of outflow collimation, accretor size, and resolution is also
investigated. In general, the accretion rate is significantly affected by
mechanical feedback. The effect is small for outflows perpendicular to the
medium motion, and quickly grows for smaller angles. Moreover, the smaller the
medium-to-outflow velocity ratio is, the more accretion decreases. On the other
hand, the impact of outflow collimation seems moderate. The effect is enhanced
when the accretor size is reduced. For a population of BH with random outflow
orientations, the average accretion rate drops by (high-low resolution)
~0.2-0.4 and ~0.1-0.2 for medium-to-outflow velocity ratios of 1/20 and 1/100,
respectively, when compared to the corresponding cases without outflow. Our
results strongly indicate that, on the considered scales, mechanical feedback
can easily reduce the energy available from supersonic accretion by a factor of
several. This should be taken into account when studying the mechanical,
thermal and non-thermal output of isolated BH.

may not destroy the beam with its wakefield, depending on the phase and
amplitude of the wakefield. We numerically study which perturbations can
destroy a single short bunch or a train of many short bunches at the parameters

AME. These non-detections, and other upper limits in the literature, are
nevertheless consistent with the average AME emissivity from the few

organizations. Since transforming business digitally is an ongoing process, it
requires an integrated and disciplined approach. Data Operations (DataOps),
emerging in practice, can provide organizations with such an approach to
leverage data and analytics for digital business transformation. This paper
proposes a framework that integrates digital business transformation, data
analytics, and DataOps through the lens of information processing theory (IPT).
The details of this framework explain how organizations can employ DataOps as
an integrated and disciplined approach to understand their analytical
information needs and develop the analytical information processing capability
required for digital business transformation. DataOps-enabled digital business
transformation, in turn, improves organizational performance by improving
operational efficiency and creating new business models. This research extends
current knowledge on digital transformation by bringing in DataOps and

mass ejections and corotating interaction regions (CIRs), causing so-called
Forbush decreases and recurrent Forbush decreases (RFDs), respectively. We
explain the properties and behavior of RFDs recorded at about 1 au that are
caused by CIRs generated by solar wind high-speed streams (HSSs) that emanate
from coronal holes. We employed a convection-diffusion GCR propagation model
based on the Fokker-Planck equation and applied it to solar wind and
interplanetary magnetic field properties at 1 au. Our analysis shows that the
only two effects that are relevant for a plausible overall explanation of the
observations are the enhanced convection effect caused by the increased
velocity of the HSS and the reduced diffusion effect caused by the enhanced
magnetic field and its fluctuations within the CIR and HSS structure. These two
effects that we considered in the model are sufficient to explain not only the
main signatures of RFDs, but also the sometimes observed ""over-recovery"" and
secondary dips in RFD profiles. The explanation in terms of the
convection-diffusion GCR propagation hypothesis is tested by applying our model
to the observations of a long-lived CIR that recurred over 27 rotations in
2007-2008. Our analysis demonstrates a very good match of the model results and
observations.

connect us to science every day. Here, we theoretically and experimentally
investigate the swelling and softening of pasta due to liquid imbibition, as
well as the elastic deformation and adhesion of pasta due to capillary force.
As water diffuses into the pasta during cooking, it softens gradually from the
outside inward as starch swells. The softening follows three sequential
regimes: Regime I shows a slow decrease of modulus with cooking time; Regime
II, the glassy to rubbery transition region, is characterized by very fast,
several orders of magnitude drop in modulus; and regime III, the rubbery
region, has an asymptotic modulus about four orders of magnitude lower than the
raw pasta. We present experiments and theory to capture these regimes and
relate them to the heterogeneous microstructure changes associated with
swelling. Interestingly, we observe a modulus drop of two orders of magnitude
within the range of 'al dente' cooking duration, and we find the modulus to be
extremely sensitive to the amount of salt added to the boiling water. While
most chefs can gauge the pasta by tasting its texture, our proposed experiment,
which only requires a measurement with a ruler, can precisely provide an
optimal cooking time finely tuned for various kinds of pasta shapes.

of Doppler frequency offset (DFO) on system performance, exact closed-form

According to the simulation results, we find that the CF massive MIMO-OFDM
system with LSFD achieves both larger SE and lower SE drop percentages than
other systems. In addition, increasing the number of access points (APs) and
antennas per AP can effectively compensate for the performance loss from the
DFO. Moreover, there is an optimal vertical distance between APs and HST to

Carrington rotations 2057-2083 in the time period from June 2007 - May 2009. We
studied the in situ measurements of this long-lived CIR as well as the
corresponding depression in the cosmic ray (CR) count observed by SOHO/EPHIN
throughout different rotations. We performed a statistical analysis, as well as
the superposed epoch analysis, using relative values of the key parameters: the
total magnetic field strength, B, the magnetic field fluctuations, dBrms,
plasma flow speed, v, plasma density, n, plasma temperature, T , and the
SOHO/EPHIN F-detector particle count, and CR count. We find that the mirrored
CR count-time profile is correlated with that of the flow speed, ranging from
moderate to strong correlation, depending on the rotation. In addition, we find
that the CR count dip amplitude is correlated to the peak in the magnetic field
and flow speed of the CIR. These results are in agreement with previous
statistical studies. Finally, using the superposed epoch analysis, we obtain a
generic CIR example, which reflects the in situ properties of a typical CIR
well. Our results are better explained based on the combined
convection-diffusion approach of the CIR-related GCR modulation. Furthermore,
qualitatively, our results do not differ from those based on different CHs
samples. This indicates that the change of the physical properties of the
recurring CIR from one rotation to another is not qualitatively different from
the change of the physical properties of CIRs originating from different CHs.
Finally, the obtained generic CIR example, analyzed on the basis of superposed
epoch analysis, can be used as a reference for testing future models.

theory to the cubic closed string field theory, which may describe Einstein
gravity in the low energy sector consistently. In the present study we propose
a cubic closed string field theory, introducing a double layer to describe the
closed string world-sheet as an extension of the open string world-sheet of the
Witten's cubic open string. We mapped the closed string world-sheet onto the
complex plane, of which the lower half plane is completely covered by the
extended part of the string world-sheet. Using the Green's function on the
complex plane, evaluated the Polyakov string path integral, from which we
extracted the Neumann functions and the vertex operators. We obtained the one
and two string vertices (identities) following this procedure and finally the
cubic string vertex operator. It is notable that the obtained cubic string
scattering amplitude coincide with the cubic graviton interaction of the
Einstein gravity. Thus, the resultant cubic closed string field theory
consistently describes the Einstein gravity. We also show that the
Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations of the first quantized string theory may be
manifested in the cubic closed string field theory.

  Annotations","54 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AI-aided drug discovery (AIDD) is gaining increasing popularity due to its
promise of making the search for new pharmaceuticals quicker, cheaper and more
efficient. In spite of its extensive use in many fields, such as ADMET
prediction, virtual screening, protein folding and generative chemistry, little
has been explored in terms of the out-of-distribution (OOD) learning problem
with \emph{noise}, which is inevitable in real world AIDD applications.
  In this work, we present DrugOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and
benchmark for AI-aided drug discovery, which comes with an open-source Python
package that fully automates the data curation and OOD benchmarking processes.
We focus on one of the most crucial problems in AIDD: drug target binding
affinity prediction, which involves both macromolecule (protein target) and
small-molecule (drug compound). In contrast to only providing fixed datasets,
DrugOOD offers automated dataset curator with user-friendly customization
scripts, rich domain annotations aligned with biochemistry knowledge, realistic
noise annotations and rigorous benchmarking of state-of-the-art OOD algorithms.
Since the molecular data is often modeled as irregular graphs using graph
neural network (GNN) backbones, DrugOOD also serves as a valuable testbed for
\emph{graph OOD learning} problems. Extensive empirical studies have shown a
significant performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
experiments, which highlights the need to develop better schemes that can allow
for OOD generalization under noise for AIDD.

particles on the formation of supraparticles (clusters of colloidal particles)

efficient and simple approach to form supraparticles, overcoming the challenge
of the coffee stain effect in situ. Supraparticles are an efficient route to
high-performance materials in various fields, from catalysis to carriers for
therapeutics. Yet, the role of the surface of colloidal particles in the
formation of supraparticles using Ouzo droplets remains unknown. Therefore, we
used silica particles as a model system and compared sterically stabilized
versus electrostatically stabilized silica particles - positively and
negatively charged. Additionally, we studied the effect of hydration. Hydrated
negatively charged silica particles and sterically stabilized silica particles
form supraparticles. Conversely, dehydrated negatively charged silica particles
and positively charged amine-coated particles form flat film-like deposits.
Notably, the assembly process is different for all the four types of particles.
The surface modifications alter (a) the contact line motion of the Ouzo droplet
and (b) the particle-oil and particle-substrate interactions. These alterations
modify the particle accumulation at the various interfaces, which ultimately
determines the shape of the final deposit. Thus, by modulating the surface
properties of the colloidal particles, we can tune the shape of the final
deposit, from a spheroidal supraparticle to a flat deposit. In the future, this
approach can be used to tailor the supraparticles for applications such as
optics and catalysis, where the shape affects the functionality.

near and mid-IR fluxes from 2MASS and WISE surveys, respectively. The sample
contains 418 cool red clump giants and 359 upper red giant branch giants. Most
of the giants and majority of super Li-rich giants show no IR excess. Only five
red clump giants and one RGB giant show IR excess. Notably, of the five red
clump giants with IR excess, three are super Li-rich (A(Li) > = 3.2 dex), and
two are Li-rich (A(Li) > = 1.0 dex). Results suggest Li enhancement among red
clump giants may be due to two channels: one resulting from in-situ He-flash in
single star evolution and the other due to He-flash triggered by events like
merger of He-white dwarfs with giants He-inert core on RGB. In the latter case,
IR excess, as a result of mass loss, is expected from merger events. We have
modelled IR excess in all six giants using DUSTY code and derived dust
parameters. The estimated kinematic ages and time scales of dust envelopes of
the super Li-rich phase suggest Li enhancement took place very recently.
Further, the analysis shows a significantly higher proportion (four out of five
red clump giants) of rapid rotators (vsini > = 8 km/s) among Li-rich giants
with IR excess compared to Li-normal and Li-rich giants with no IR excess.

Owing to their large masses, their eventual decay products -- SM leptons and
bosons -- tend to be highly boosted, with the jets stemming from the SM bosons
more likely to manifest themselves as a single fat-jet rather than two resolved
ones. With the corresponding SM backgrounds being suppressed, final states with
two or three leptons and one or two fat-jets are expected to be sensitive in
probing exotic fermions much heavier than 1 TeV, and we propose and investigate
an appropriate search strategy. To concentrate on the essential, we consider
extensions of the SM by leptonic multiplets of a single kind (triplets,
quadruplets or quintuplets), bearing in mind that such simplified models
typically arise as low-energy limits of more ambitious scenarios addressing
various lacunae of the SM. Performing a systematic and comprehensive study of

Moreover, most existing solutions cannot defend against adaptive attacks,
wherein attackers are knowledgeable about the defense mechanisms and craft AEs
accordingly. In this paper, we propose a novel AE detection framework based on
the very nature of AEs, i.e., their semantic information is inconsistent with
the discriminative features extracted by the target DNN model. To be specific,
the proposed solution, namely ContraNet, models such contradiction by first
taking both the input and the inference result to a generator to obtain a
synthetic output and then comparing it against the original input. For
legitimate inputs that are correctly inferred, the synthetic output tries to
reconstruct the input. On the contrary, for AEs, instead of reconstructing the
input, the synthetic output would be created to conform to the wrong label
whenever possible. Consequently, by measuring the distance between the input
and the synthetic output with metric learning, we can differentiate AEs from
legitimate inputs. We perform comprehensive evaluations under various AE attack
scenarios, and experimental results show that ContraNet outperforms existing
solutions by a large margin, especially under adaptive attacks. Moreover, our
analysis shows that successful AEs that can bypass ContraNet tend to have
much-weakened adversarial semantics. We have also shown that ContraNet can be
easily combined with adversarial training techniques to achieve further
improved AE defense capabilities.

components: a kernel-resident driver that accesses virtualization hardware and
a user-level helper process that provides VM management and I/O virtualization.
However, this virtualization architecture has intrinsic issues in both security
(a large attack surface) and performance. While there is a long thread of work
trying to minimize the kernel-resident driver by offloading functions to user
mode, they face a fundamental tradeoff between security and performance: more
offloading may reduce the kernel attack surface, yet increase the runtime ring
crossings between the helper process and the driver, and thus more performance
cost.
  This paper explores a new design called delegated virtualization, which
completely separates the control plane (the kernel driver) from the data plane
(the helper process) and thus eliminates the kernel driver from runtime
intervention. The resulting user-level hypervisor, called DuVisor, can handle
all VM operations without trapping into the kernel once the kernel driver has
done the initialization. DuVisor retrofits existing hardware virtualization
support with a new delegated virtualization extension to directly handle VM
exits, configure virtualization registers, manage the stage-2 page table and
virtual devices in user mode. We have implemented the hardware extension on an
open-source RISC-V CPU and built a Rust-based hypervisor atop the hardware.
Evaluation on FireSim shows that DuVisor outperforms KVM by up to 47.96\% in a
variety of real-world applications and significantly reduces the attack
surface.

depth of the planning horizon, and the branching factor due to having many
choices. Hierarchical reinforcement learning methods aim to solve the first
problem, by providing shortcuts that skip over multiple time steps. To cope
with the breadth, it is desirable to restrict the agent's attention at each
step to a reasonable number of possible choices. The concept of affordances
(Gibson, 1977) suggests that only certain actions are feasible in certain
states. In this work, we model ""affordances"" through an attention mechanism
that limits the available choices of temporally extended options. We present an
online, model-free algorithm to learn affordances that can be used to further
learn subgoal options. We investigate the role of hard versus soft attention in
training data collection, abstract value learning in long-horizon tasks, and
handling a growing number of choices. We identify and empirically illustrate
the settings in which the paradox of choice arises, i.e. when having fewer but
more meaningful choices improves the learning speed and performance of a
reinforcement learning agent.

Parkinson's Disease (IPD) is a rare clinical presentation of GRN and C9orf72
mutations, the major genetic causes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It still
remains controversial if this association is fortuitous or not, and which
clinical clues could reliably suggest a genetic FTD etiology in IPD patients.
This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of FTD mutation
carriers presenting with IPD phenotype, provide neuropathological evidence of
the mutation's causality, and specifically address their ""red flags"" according
to current IPD criteria. Methods: Seven GRN and C9orf72 carriers with isolated
parkinsonism at onset, and three patients from the literature were included in
this study. To allow better delineation of their phenotype, the presence of
supportive, exclusion and ""red flag"" features from MDS criteria were analyzed
for each case. Results: Amongst the ten patients (5 GRN, 5 C9orf72), seven
fulfilled probable IPD criteria during all the disease course, while
behavioral/language or motoneuron dysfunctions occurred later in three. Disease
duration was longer and dopa-responsiveness was more sustained in C9orf72 than
in GRN carriers. Subtle motor features, cognitive/behavioral changes, family
history of dementia/ALS were suggestive clues for a genetic diagnosis.
Importantly, neuropathological examination in one patient revealed typical
TDP-43-inclusions without alpha-synucleinopathy, thus demonstrating the causal
link between FTD mutations, TDP-43-pathology and PD phenotype. Conclusion: We
showed that, altogether, family history of early-onset dementia/ALS, the
presence of cognitive/behavioral dysfunction and subtle motor characteristics
are atypical features frequently present in the parkinsonian presentations of
GRN and C9orf72 mutations .

ecological networks. Local-scale analyses focus on specific nodes of the
spatial network, while regional-scale analyses consider the whole network.
Similarly, species- and community-level analyses either account for single
species or for the whole community. Furthermore, stability itself can be
defined in multiple ways, including resistance (the inverse of the relative
displacement caused by a perturbation), initial resilience (the rate of return
after a perturbation), and invariability (the inverse of the relative amplitude
of the population fluctuations). Here, we analyze the scale-dependence of these
stability properties. More specifically, we ask how spatial scale (local vs
regional) and ecological scale (species vs community) influence these stability
properties. We find that regional initial resilience is the weighted arithmetic
mean of the local initial resiliences. The regional resistance is the harmonic
mean of local resistances, which makes regional resistance particularly
vulnerable to nodes with low stability, unlike regional initial resilience.
Analogous results hold for the relationship between community- and
species-level initial resilience and resistance. Both resistance and initial
resilience are ``scale-free'' properties: regional and community values are
simply the biomass-weighted means of the local and species values,
respectively. Thus, one can easily estimate both stability metrics of whole
networks from partial sampling. In contrast, invariability generally is greater
at the regional and community-level than at the local and species-level,
respectively. Hence, estimating the invariability of spatial or ecological
networks from measurements at the local or species level is more complicated,
requiring an unbiased estimate of the network (i.e. region or community) size.

solution to implement cell-free networks. However, the performance gains
achieved by IRSs critically depend on smartly tuned passive beamforming based
on the assumption that the accurate channel state information (CSI) knowledge
is available, which is practically impossible. Thus, in this paper, we
investigate the impact of the CSI uncertainty on IRS-assisted cell-free
networks. We adopt a stochastic programming method to cope with the CSI
uncertainty by maximizing the expectation of the sum-rate, which guarantees
robust performance over the average. Accordingly, an average sum-rate
maximization problem is formulated, which is non-convex and arduous to obtain
its optimal solution due to the coupled variables and the expectation operation
with respect to CSI uncertainties. As a compromising approach, we develop an
efficient robust joint design algorithm with low-complexity. Particularly, the
original problem is equivalently transformed into a tractable form, and then,
the locally optimal solution can be obtained by employing the block coordinate
descent method. We further prove that the CSI uncertainty impacts the design of
the active transmitting beamforming of APs, but surprisingly does not directly
impact the design of the passive reflecting beamforming of IRSs. It is worth
noting that the investigated scenario is flexible and general, and thus the
proposed algorithm can act as a general framework to solve various sum-rate
maximization problems. Simulation results demonstrate that IRSs can achieve
considerable data rate improvement for conventional cell-free networks, and
confirm the resilience of the proposed algorithm against the CSI uncertainty.

face parsers and face landmark detectors. These models provide the flexibility
to construct various criterions with very concrete and interpretable semantic
meanings (e.g., change face shape or change skin color) to restrict latent
subspace disentanglement. Rich latent space controls unknown previously can be
discovered using the constructed criterions. Second, we propose a new

counterfactuals in the interpretable latent subspaces we discovered. This
explanation helps reveal whether the classifier learns semantics as intended.
Experiments on various disentanglement criterions demonstrate the effectiveness

our findings, the COH group has the lowest formation energy on a perfect (110)
surface, while the COC is favored on a defective surface. As for the (111)
surface, the COC group is the most stable for both pristine and defective
surfaces. Similarly, COC group is also the most stable one on the

statements created from heterogeneous data sources. KG creation is laborious
and demands data management techniques to be executed efficiently. This paper
tackles the problem of the automatic generation of KG creation processes
declaratively specified; it proposes techniques for planning and transforming
heterogeneous data into RDF triples following mapping assertions specified in
the RDF Mapping Language (RML). Given a set of mapping assertions, the planner
provides an optimized execution plan by partitioning and scheduling the
execution of the assertions. First, the planner assesses an optimized number of
partitions considering the number of data sources, type of mapping assertions,
and the associations between different assertions. After providing a list of
partitions and assertions that belong to each partition, the planner determines
their execution order. A greedy algorithm is implemented to generate the
partitions' bushy tree execution plan. Bushy tree plans are translated into
operating system commands that guide the execution of the partitions of the
mapping assertions in the order indicated by the bushy tree. The proposed
optimization approach is evaluated over state-of-the-art RML-compliant engines,
and existing benchmarks of data sources and RML triples maps. Our experimental
results suggest that the performance of the studied engines can be considerably
improved, particularly in a complex setting with numerous triples maps and
large data sources. As a result, engines that time out in complex cases are
enabled to produce at least a portion of the KG applying the planner.

These works are subject to two major limitations: (1) They are dedicated to
specific QG formats (e.g., answer-extraction or multi-choice QG), therefore, if
we want to address a new format of QG, a re-design of the QG model is required.
(2) Optimal performance is only achieved on the dataset they were just trained

datasets, which is resource-intensive and ungeneralizable.
  To solve the problems, we propose a model named Unified-QG based on lifelong

datasets and formats. Specifically, we first build a format-convert encoding to
transform different kinds of QG formats into a unified representation. Then, a

of existing wave identification methods. Our method allows to investigate the
energy fluxes in different MHD modes at different locations of the solar
atmosphere as waves generated by vortex flows travel through the solar
atmosphere and pass near the magnetic null. We simulate wave dynamics through a
coronal null configuration and apply a rotational wave driver at our bottom
photospheric boundary. To identify the wave energy fluxes associated with
different MHD wave modes, we employ a wave-decomposition method that is able to
uniquely distinguish different MHD modes. Our proposed method utilizes the
geometry of an individual magnetic field-line in 3D space to separate out
velocity perturbations associated with the three fundamental MHD waves. Our
method for wave identification is consistent with previous flux-surface-based
methods and gives expected results in terms of wave energy fluxes at various
locations of the null configuration. We show that ubiquitous vortex flows
excite MHD waves that contribute significantly to the Poynting flux in the
solar corona. Alfv\'en wave energy flux accumulates on the fan surface and fast
wave energy flux accumulates near the null point. There is a strong current
density buildup at the spine and fan surface.The proposed method has advantages
over previously utilized wave decomposition methods, since it may be employed
in realistic simulations or magnetic extrapolations, as well as in real solar
observations, whenever the 3D fieldline shape is known. The enhancement in
energy flux associated with magneto-acoustic waves near nulls may have
important implications in the formation of jets and impulsive plasma flows.

theoretically motivated link between the Standard Model (SM) and new physics.
While Higgs portals can be constrained well by exotic Higgs decays if the
beyond-the-SM states are light, testing scenarios where these particles are
kinematically inaccessible is known to be challenging. We explore the
sensitivity of future hadron collider measurements of $ZZ \to 4 \ell$
production in constraining Higgs portal interactions. It is shown that by using
a matrix-element based kinematic discriminant the reach of the high-luminosity
option of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can be significantly enhanced
compared to studies that are based on measurements of the four-lepton invariant
mass spectrum alone. We also analyse the potential of the high-energy upgrade
of the LHC and a Future Circular Collider in constraining new physics that
couples to $|H|^2$. The obtained constraints are compared to the limits one
expects to find from other single-Higgs probes. In addition, we provide an
independent analysis of the relevant Higgs portal effects in double-Higgs
production. We find that the constraints obtained from our $ZZ \to 4 \ell$
analysis turn out to be both competitive with and complementary to the
projected limits obtained using other search techniques.

  Novelty Detection and Active Learning",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning-based pre-simulation (i.e., layout-to-fabrication) models have been
proposed to predict the fabrication-induced shape deformation from an IC layout
to its fabricated circuit. Such models are usually driven by pairwise learning,
involving a training set of layout patterns and their reference shape images
after fabrication. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to collect the
reference shape images of all layout clips for model training and updating. To
address the problem, we propose a deep learning-based layout novelty detection
scheme to identify novel (unseen) layout patterns, which cannot be well
predicted by a pre-trained pre-simulation model. We devise a global-local
novelty scoring mechanism to assess the potential novelty of a layout by
exploiting two subnetworks: an autoencoder and a pretrained pre-simulation
model. The former characterizes the global structural dissimilarity between a
given layout and training samples, whereas the latter extracts a latent code
representing the fabrication-induced local deformation. By integrating the
global dissimilarity with the local deformation boosted by a self-attention
mechanism, our model can accurately detect novelties without the ground-truth
circuit shapes of test samples. Based on the detected novelties, we further
propose two active-learning strategies to sample a reduced amount of
representative layouts most worthy to be fabricated for acquiring their
ground-truth circuit shapes. Experimental results demonstrate i) our method's
effectiveness in layout novelty detection, and ii) our active-learning
strategies' ability in selecting representative novel layouts for keeping a
learning-based pre-simulation model updated.

J0305-3150 (z=6.61). Recent SCUBA2 imaging revealed the presence of 17
submillimeter galaxies (SMG) with sky separations $0.7'< \theta < 2.4'$ from
these three quasars. We present ALMA Band 6 follow-up observations of these

continuum-undetected [CII] emitters in the ALMA pointings and make use of
archival MUSE observations to search for Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitters (LAE)
associated with the quasars. While most of the SCUBA2-selected sources are
detected with ALMA in the continuum, no [CII] line emission could be detected,
indicating that they are not at the quasar redshifts. Based on the
serendipitous detection of CO 7-6 and [CI] emission lines, we find that four
SMGs in the field of PJ231-20 are at z~2.4, which is coincident with the
redshift of a Mg II absorber in the quasar rest-frame UV spectrum. We report
the discovery of 2 LAEs within <0.6 cMpc of PJ231-20 at the same redshift,
indicating a LAE overdensity around this quasar. Taken together, these
observations provide new constraints on the large-scale excess of
Lyman-$\alpha$- and [CII]-emitting galaxies around z>6 quasars and suggest that
only wide-field observations, such as MUSE, ALMA or JWST mosaics, can reveal a

  effect?",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In $d$ dimensions, accurately approximating an arbitrary function oscillating
with frequency $\lesssim k$ requires $\sim k^d$ degrees of freedom. A numerical
method for solving the Helmholtz equation (with wavenumber $k$ and in $d$
dimensions) suffers from the pollution effect if, as $k\to\infty$, the total
number of degrees of freedom needed to maintain accuracy grows faster than this
natural threshold (i.e., faster than $k^d$ for domain-based formulations, such
as finite element methods, and $k^{d-1}$ for boundary-based formulations, such
as boundary element methods).
  It is well known that the $h$-version of the finite element method (FEM)
(where accuracy is increased by decreasing the meshwidth $h$ and keeping the
polynomial degree $p$ fixed) suffers from the pollution effect, and research
over the last $\sim$ 30 years has resulted in a near-complete rigorous
understanding of how quickly the number of degrees of freedom must grow with
$k$ to maintain accuracy.
  In contrast to the $h$-FEM, at least empirically, the $h$-version of the
boundary element method (BEM) does $\textit{not}$ suffer from the pollution
effect (recall that in the boundary element method the scattering problem is
reformulated as an integral equation on the boundary of the scatterer, with
this integral equation then solved numerically using a finite-element-type
approximation space). However, the current best results in the literature on
how quickly the number of degrees of freedom for the $h$-BEM must grow with $k$
to maintain accuracy fall short of proving this.
  In this paper, we prove that the $h$-version of the Galerkin method applied
to the standard second-kind boundary integral equations for solving the
Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet problem does not suffer from the pollution effect
when the obstacle is nontrapping (i.e., does not trap geometric-optic rays).

infection. In a Metropolis-Hastings step, the latent data are jointly proposed
from a surrogate process carefully designed to closely resemble the SIR model,
from which we can efficiently generate epidemics consistent with the observed
data. This yields a method that explores the high-dimensional latent space
efficiently, and scales to outbreaks with hundreds of thousands of individuals.
We show that the Markov chain underlying the algorithm is uniformly ergodic,
and validate its performance via thorough simulation experiments and a case
study on the 2013-2015 outbreak of Ebola Haemorrhagic Fever in Western Africa.

information is a fundamental issue with enormous practical and industrial
relevance for the monitoring of devices and components. Thanks to recent
advances in deep learning, accurate failure predictions are becoming possible
even for strongly disordered solids, but the sheer number of parameters used in
the process renders a physical interpretation of the results impossible. Here
we address this issue and use machine learning methods to predict the failure
of simulated two dimensional silica glasses from their initial undeformed
structure. We then exploit Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
(Grad-CAM) to build attention maps associated with the predictions, and we
demonstrate that these maps are amenable to physical interpretation in terms of
topological defects and local potential energies. We show that our predictions
can be transferred to samples with different shape or size than those used in
training, as well as to experimental images. Our strategy illustrates how
artificial neural networks trained with numerical simulation results can
provide interpretable predictions of the behavior of experimentally measured

  Training in Image Retrieval","Accepted to ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The task of hot-refresh model upgrades of image retrieval systems plays an
essential role in the industry but has never been investigated in academia
before. Conventional cold-refresh model upgrades can only deploy new models
after the gallery is overall backfilled, taking weeks or even months for
massive data. In contrast, hot-refresh model upgrades deploy the new model
immediately and then gradually improve the retrieval accuracy by backfilling
the gallery on-the-fly. Compatible training has made it possible, however, the
problem of model regression with negative flips poses a great challenge to the
stable improvement of user experience. We argue that it is mainly due to the
fact that new-to-old positive query-gallery pairs may show less similarity than
new-to-new negative pairs. To solve the problem, we introduce a
Regression-Alleviating Compatible Training (RACT) method to properly constrain
the feature compatibility while reducing negative flips. The core is to
encourage the new-to-old positive pairs to be more similar than both the
new-to-old negative pairs and the new-to-new negative pairs. An efficient
uncertainty-based backfilling strategy is further introduced to fasten accuracy
improvements. Extensive experiments on large-scale retrieval benchmarks (e.g.,
Google Landmark) demonstrate that our RACT effectively alleviates the model
regression for one more step towards seamless model upgrades. The code will be
available at https://github.com/binjiezhang/RACT_ICLR2022.

depend on a random, unknown state of nature. The auction mechanism has complete
knowledge of the actual state of nature, and it can send signals to bidders so
as to disclose information about the state and increase revenue. For instance,
a state may collectively encode some features of the user that are known to the
mechanism only, since the latter has access to data sources unaccessible to the
bidders. We study the problem of computing how the mechanism should send
signals to bidders in order to maximize revenue. While this problem has already
been addressed in the easier setting of second-price auctions, to the best of
our knowledge, our work is the first to explore ad auctions with more than one
slot. In this paper, we focus on public signaling and VCG mechanisms, under
which bidders truthfully report their valuations. We start with a negative
result, showing that, in general, the problem does not admit a PTAS unless P =
NP, even when bidders' valuations are known to the mechanism. The rest of the
paper is devoted to settings in which such negative result can be circumvented.
First, we prove that, with known valuations, the problem can indeed be solved
in polynomial time when either the number of states d or the number of slots m
is fixed. Moreover, in the same setting, we provide an FPTAS for the case in
which bidders are single minded, but d and m can be arbitrary. Then, we switch
to the random valuations setting, in which these are randomly drawn according
to some probability distribution. In this case, we show that the problem admits
an FPTAS, a PTAS, and a QPTAS, when, respectively, d is fixed, m is fixed, and
bidders' valuations are bounded away from zero.

applications. Moreover, constellations of CubeSats in low-earth orbits can meet
the increasing demands of global-coverage flexible low-cost high-speed
connectivity. However, this requires innovative solutions to overcome the
significant challenges that face high-data-rate low-power space communications.
This paper provides a comprehensive and critical review of the design and
architecture of recent CubeSat communication systems with a particular focus on
their baseband architectures. The literature is surveyed in detail to identify
all baseband design, testing, and demonstration stages as well as accurately
describe the systems architecture and communication protocols. The reliability,
performance, data rate, and power consumption of the reviewed systems are
critically evaluated to understand the limitations of current CubeSat systems

communication systems still face many challenges, namely the development of
energy-efficient high-speed modems that satisfy CubeSats requirements.
Nevertheless, there are several promising directions for improvements such as
the use of improved coding algorithms, use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays,
multiple access techniques, beamforming, advanced antennas, and transition to
higher frequency bands. By providing a concrete summary of current CubeSat

  Learning on Epileptic Seizure Detection",,,,,"cs.NE cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Wearable and unobtrusive monitoring and prediction of epileptic seizures has
the potential to significantly increase the life quality of patients, but is
still an unreached goal due to challenges of real-time detection and wearable
devices design. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing has evolved in recent years as
a new promising machine learning approach, especially when talking about
wearable applications. But in the case of epilepsy detection, standard HD
computing is not performing at the level of other state-of-the-art algorithms.
This could be due to the inherent complexity of the seizures and their
signatures in different biosignals, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG), the
highly personalized nature, and the disbalance of seizure and non-seizure
instances. In the literature, different strategies for improved learning of HD
computing have been proposed, such as iterative (multi-pass) learning,
multi-centroid learning and learning with sample weight (""OnlineHD""). Yet, most
of them have not been tested on the challenging task of epileptic seizure
detection, and it stays unclear whether they can increase the HD computing
performance to the level of the current state-of-the-art algorithms, such as
random forests. Thus, in this paper, we implement different learning strategies
and assess their performance on an individual basis, or in combination,
regarding detection performance and memory and computational requirements.
Results show that the best-performing algorithm, which is a combination of
multi-centroid and multi-pass, can indeed reach the performance of the random
forest model on a highly unbalanced dataset imitating a real-life epileptic
seizure detection application.

circular. We are also able to remove the topological condition on $\Omega$ if
we impose regularity and nondegeneracy assumptions on $u$ at $\partial \Omega$.
The proof uses that the corresponding stream function solves an elliptic
semilinear problem $-\Delta \phi = f(\phi)$ with $\nabla \phi=0$ at the
boundary. One of the main difficulties in our study is that $f$ is not
Lipschitz continuous near the boundary values. However, $f(\phi)$ vanishes at
the boundary values and then we can apply a local symmetry result of F. Brock
to conclude.
  In the case $\partial_{\nu} u \neq 0$ at $\partial \Omega$ this argument is
not possible. In this case we are able to use the moving plane scheme to show
symmetry, despite the possible lack of regularity of $f$. We think that such
result is interesting in its own right and will be stated and proved also for
higher dimensions. The proof requires the study of maximum principles, Hopf

generates the action to be taken in the current time step in order to maximize
expected future return. While flexible, it faces difficulties arising from the
inefficient exploration due to its single step nature. In this work, we present
Generative Planning method (GPM), which can generate actions not only for the
current step, but also for a number of future steps (thus termed as generative
planning). This brings several benefits to GPM. Firstly, since GPM is trained
by maximizing value, the plans generated from it can be regarded as intentional
action sequences for reaching high value regions. GPM can therefore leverage
its generated multi-step plans for temporally coordinated exploration towards
high value regions, which is potentially more effective than a sequence of
actions generated by perturbing each action at single step level, whose
consistent movement decays exponentially with the number of exploration steps.
Secondly, starting from a crude initial plan generator, GPM can refine it to be
adaptive to the task, which, in return, benefits future explorations. This is
potentially more effective than commonly used action-repeat strategy, which is
non-adaptive in its form of plans. Additionally, since the multi-step plan can
be interpreted as the intent of the agent from now to a span of time period
into the future, it offers a more informative and intuitive signal for
interpretation. Experiments are conducted on several benchmark environments and
the results demonstrated its effectiveness compared with several baseline
methods.

high-performance computing (HPC). We focus on input/output (I/O) variability.
To study the performance variability, computer scientists often use grid-based
designs (GBDs) to collect I/O variability data, and use mathematical
approximation methods to build a prediction model. Mathematical approximation
models could be biased particularly if extrapolations are needed. Space-filling
designs (SFDs) and surrogate models such as Gaussian process (GP) are popular
for data collection and building predictive models. The applicability of SFDs
and surrogates in the HPC variability needs investigation. We investigate their
applicability in the HPC setting in terms of design efficiency, prediction
accuracy, and scalability. We first customize the existing SFDs so that they
can be applied in the HPC setting. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of
design strategies and the prediction ability of approximation methods. We use
both synthetic data simulated from three test functions and the real data from
the HPC setting. We then compare different methods in terms of design
efficiency, prediction accuracy, and scalability. In synthetic and real data
analysis, GP with SFDs outperforms in most scenarios. With respect to
approximation models, GP is recommended if the data are collected by SFDs. If
data are collected using GBDs, both GP and Delaunay can be considered. With the
best choice of approximation method, the performance of SFDs and GBD depends on
the property of the underlying surface. For the cases in which SFDs perform
better, the number of design points needed for SFDs is about half of or less
than that of the GBD to achieve the same prediction accuracy. SFDs that can be
tailored to high dimension and non-smooth surface are recommended especially
when large numbers of input factors need to be considered in the model.

correlation coefficient ($r_{12}$) between W1 magnitude and W1$-$W2 color based
on the light curve in individual objects. Interestingly, $r_{12}$ spans a broad
range from $-1$ to $1$, and is detected to be correlated with mean W1$-$W2
color and AGN bolometric luminosity, in the sense that objects with blue
W1$-$W2 color and low AGN luminosity tend to become redder (bluer) with
increasing (decreasing) W1 brightness in the light curve (i.e. $r_{12} < 0$),
although the correlation of $r_{12}$ with the bolometric luminosity is
relatively weak. The fit for the spectral energy distribution reveals a
significant contribution from the host galaxy in the W1 and W2 bands. However,
the dependencies of $r_{12}$ on W1$-$W2 color and AGN luminosity still persist
even after careful elimination of the host light contribution. We propose that
this result can be explained if covering factor of the hot dust component
decreases as AGN luminosity increases.

Architecture Search (NAS) approach for finding better SNN architectures.
Inspired by recent NAS approaches that find the optimal architecture from
activation patterns at initialization, we select the architecture that can
represent diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples
without training. Moreover, to further leverage the temporal information among
the spikes, we search for feed forward connections as well as backward

Interestingly, SNASNet found by our search algorithm achieves higher

vaccination has become necessary. In addition, infections caused by the
different variants and correlated factors have not been discussed in depth.
With large variabilities and different co-factors, it is difficult to use
conventional mathematical models to forecast the incidence of COVID-19.
  Methods: Machine learning based on long short-term memory was applied to
forecasting the time series of new daily positive cases (DPC), serious cases,
hospitalized cases, and deaths. Data acquired from regions with high rates of
vaccination, such as Israel, were blended with the current data of other
regions in Japan to factor in the potential effects of vaccination. The
protection provided by symptomatic infection was also considered in terms of
the population effectiveness of vaccination as well as the waning protection
and ratio and infectivity of viral variants. To represent changes in public
behavior, public mobility and interactions through social media were also
included in the analysis.
  Findings: Comparing the observed and estimated new DPC in Tel Aviv, Israel,
the parameters characterizing vaccination effectiveness and the waning
protection from infection were well estimated; the vaccination effectiveness of
the second dose after 5 months and the third dose after two weeks from
infection by the delta variant were 0.24 and 0.95, respectively. Using the
extracted parameters regarding vaccination effectiveness, new cases in three
prefectures of Japan were replicated.

evolution of classical four-dimensional (4D) worldlines $x^\mu \left( \tau

Combining insights from SHP electrodynamics and the ADM formalism in general
relativity, we generalize the notion of a 4D spacetime $\mathcal{M}$ to a
formal manifold $\mathcal{M}_5 = \mathcal{M} \times R$, representing an
admixture of geometry (the diffeomorphism invariance of $\mathcal{M}$) and
dynamics (the system evolution of $\mathcal{M} \left( \tau \right)$ with the
monotonic advance of $\tau \in R$). Strategically breaking the formal 5D
symmetry of a metric $g_{\alpha\beta}(x,\tau)$ ($\alpha,\beta = 0,1,2,3,5 $)
posed on $\mathcal{M}_5$, we obtain ten unconstrained Einstein equations for
the $\tau$-evolution of the 4D metric $\gamma_{\mu\nu}(x,\tau)$ and five
constraints that are to be satisfied by the initial conditions. The resulting
theory differs from five-dimensional (5D) gravitation, much as SHP U(1) gauge

parameter of system evolution, is external to spacetime, playing a role similar
to what we call time in nonrelativistic mechanics. This approach, known as
Stueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron (SHP) theory, inherits the full computational power
of classical analytical mechanics while maintaining manifest covariance
throughout and eliminating possible conflict with general diffeomorphism
invariance. In particular, SHP simplifies the initial value problem with
potential applications in highly dynamical interactions, such as black hole
collisions. By allowing the energy-momentum tensor and metric to depend
explicitly on $\tau$, we may describe particle motion in geodesic form with
respect to a dynamically evolving background metric. As a toy model, we
consider a $\tau$-dependent mass $M(\tau)$, first as a perturbation in the
Newtonian approximation and then for a Schwarzschild-like metric. As expected,
the extended Einstein equations imply a non-zero energy-momentum tensor,
proportional to $dM / d\tau$, representing a flow of mass and energy into
spacetime that corresponds to the changing source mass. In $\tau$-equilibrium,
this system becomes a generalized Schwarzschild solution for which the extended
Ricci tensor and energy-momentum tensor vanish.

deal with data heterogeneity, model personalization with on-device learning is
a potential solution. However, on-device training using a user's small size of
local samples will incur severe overfitting and undermine the model's
generalization ability. In this work, we propose a new device-cloud
collaborative learning framework, called CoDA, to break the dilemmas of purely
cloud-based learning and on-device learning. The key principle of CoDA is to
retrieve similar samples from the cloud's global pool to augment each user's
local dataset to train the recommendation model. Specifically, after a
coarse-grained sample matching on the cloud, a personalized sample classifier
is further trained on each device for a fine-grained sample filtering, which
can learn the boundary between the local data distribution and the outside data
distribution. We also build an end-to-end pipeline to support the flows of
data, model, computation, and control between the cloud and each device. We
have deployed CoDA in a recommendation scenario of Mobile Taobao. Online A/B

(SC) injection in human bodies, a theoretical investigation is performed using
a two-dimensional mathematical model in the cartesian coordinate. In general, a
large variety of biological tissues behave as deformable porous material with
anisotropic hydraulic conductivity. Consequently, one can adopt the field
equations of mixture theory to describe the behavior of the interstitial fluid
and adipose cell present in the subcutaneous layer of skin. During the
procedure, a medical person takes a big pinch of the skin of the injection
application area between the thumb and index finger and holds. This process
pulls the fatty tissue away from the muscle and makes the injection process
easier. In this situation, the small aspect ratio (denoted as $\delta$) of the

highlights the issue of the mechanical response of the adipose tissue in terms
of the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity variation, the viscosity of the

predictions more precise, we built a hybrid deep learning model by embedding
Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) into the Gate
Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, and compared the performance with those of other
models. Then, based on the Iceberg Order Theory and the predicted price, we
proposed the purchasing strategy of carbon emission rights. As a result, the

the influence of various components for feature fusion. Meanwhile, multilayer

deterministic trajectories are described by currents that induce fields,
mediating interactions with other particles. Statistical methods are used when
needed to treat complex particle and/or field configurations. In
Stueckelberg-Horwitz-Piron (SHP) electrodynamics, the classical trajectories
are traced out dynamically, through the evolution of a 4D spacetime event
$x^\mu (\tau)$ as $\tau$ grows monotonically. Stueckelberg proposed to
formalize the distinction between coordinate time $x^0 = ct$ (measured by
laboratory clocks) and chronology $\tau$ (the temporal ordering of event
occurrence) in order to describe antiparticles and resolve problems of
irreversibility such as grandfather paradoxes. Consequently, in SHP theory, the
elementary object is not a particle (a 4D curve in spacetime) but rather an
event (a single point along the dynamically evolving curve). Following standard
deterministic methods in classical relativistic field theory, one is led to
Maxwell-like field equations that are \hbox{$\tau$-dependent} and sourced by a
current that represents a statistical ensemble of instantaneous events
distributed along the trajectory. The width $\lambda$ of this distribution
defines a correlation time for the interactions and a mass spectrum for the
photons emitted by particles. As $\lambda$ becomes very large, the photon mass
goes to zero and the field equations become $\tau$-independent Maxwell's
equations. Maxwell theory thus emerges as an equilibrium limit of SHP, in which
$\lambda$ is larger than any other relevant time scale. Thus, statistical
mechanics is a fundamental ingredient in SHP electrodynamics, and its insights
are required to give meaning to the concept of a particle.

acceptable probability distributions characterizing the given system, it is
best done by the one that minimizes the corresponding Fisher information. This
principle can be applied to transaction processes, the dynamics of which can be
interpreted as the market tendency to minimize the information revealed about
itself. More information involves higher costs (information is physical). The
starting point for our considerations is a description of the market derived
from the assumption of minimum Fisher information for a strategy with a fixed
financial risk. Strategies of this type that minimize Fisher information
overlap with the well-known eigenstates of a the quantum harmonic oscillator.
The analytical extension of this field of strategy to the complex vector space
(traditional for quantum mechanics) suggests the study of the interference of
the oscillator eigenstates in terms of their minimization of Fisher
information. It is revealed that the minimum value of Fisher information of the
superposition of the two strategies being the ground state and the second
excited state of the oscillator, has Fisher information less than the ground
state of the oscillator. Similarly, less information is obtained for the system
of strategies (the oscillator eigenstates) randomized by the Gibbs
distribution. We distinguish two different views on the description of Fisher
information. One of them, the classical, is based on the value of Fisher
information. The second, we call it transactional, expresses Fisher information
from the perspective of the constant risk of market strategies. The orders of
the market strategies derived from these two descriptions are different. From a
market standpoint, minimizing Fisher information is equivalent to minimizing
risk.
