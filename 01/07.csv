use of datacenters on an unsustainable path. Datacenters are already a
significant fraction of worldwide electricity use, with application demand
scaling at a rapid rate. We argue that substantial reductions in the carbon
intensity of datacenter computing are possible with a software-centric
approach: by making energy and carbon visible to application developers on a
fine-grained basis, by modifying system APIs to make it possible to make
informed trade offs between performance and carbon emissions, and by raising
the level of application programming to allow for flexible use of more energy
efficient means of compute and storage. We also lay out a research agenda for
systems software to reduce the carbon footprint of datacenter computing.

that is widely used throughout computer science. Motivated by applications
where curves stem from paths and walks on an underlying graph (such as a road
network), we define and study the Fr\'{e}chet distance for paths and walks on
graphs. When provided with a distance oracle of $G$ with $O(1)$ query time, the
classical quadratic-time dynamic program can compute the Fr\'{e}chet distance
between two walks $P$ and $Q$ in a graph $G$ in $O(|P| \cdot |Q|)$ time. We
show that there are situations where the graph structure helps with computing
Fr\'{e}chet distance: when the graph $G$ is planar, we apply existing
(approximate) distance oracles to compute a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of
the Fr\'{e}chet distance between any shortest path $P$ and any walk $Q$ in
$O(|G| \log |G| / \sqrt{\varepsilon} + |P| + \frac{|Q|}{\varepsilon } )$ time.
We generalise this result to near-shortest paths, i.e. $\kappa$-straight paths,
as we show how to compute a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation between a
$\kappa$-straight path $P$ and any walk $Q$ in $O(|G| \log |G| /
\sqrt{\varepsilon} + |P| + \frac{\kappa|Q|}{\varepsilon } )$ time. Our
algorithmic results hold for both the strong and the weak discrete Fr\'{e}chet
distance over the shortest path metric in $G$. Finally, we show that additional
assumptions on the input, such as our assumption on path straightness, are
indeed necessary to obtain truly subquadratic running time. We provide a
conditional lower bound showing that the Fr\'{e}chet distance, or even its
$1.01$-approximation, between arbitrary \emph{paths} in a weighted planar graph
cannot be computed in $O((|P|\cdot|Q|)^{1-\delta})$ time for any $\delta > 0$
unless the Orthogonal Vector Hypothesis fails. For walks, this lower bound
holds even when $G$ is planar, unit-weight and has $O(1)$ vertices.

by combining both technologies, the RIS-assisted NOMA systems are expected to
achieve greater improvements in the network throughput. However, ideal phase
control at the RIS is unrealizable in practice because of the imperfections in
the channel estimations and the hardware limitations. This imperfection in
phase control can have a significant impact on the system performance.
Motivated by this, in this paper, we consider an RIS-assisted uplink NOMA

criterion for pairing the users that achieves minimum required data rates. We
propose adaptive user pairing algorithms that maximize spectral or energy

surface area for reservoir drainage. Typical well logging correlations
associate brittleness with carbonate content or dynamic elastic properties.
However, an index of rock brittleness should involve actual rock failure and
have a consistent method to quantify it. Here we present a systematic method to
quantify mudrock brittleness based on micro-mechanical measurements from the
scratch test. Brittleness is formulated as the ratio of energy associated with
brittle failure to the total energy required to perform a scratch. Soda lime
glass and polycarbonate are used for comparison to identify failure in brittle
and ductile mode and validate the developed method. Scratch testing results on
mudrocks indicate that it is possible to use the recorded transverse force to
estimate brittleness. Results show that tested samples rank as follows in
increasing degree of brittleness: Woodford, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Mancos, and
Vaca Muerta. Eagle Ford samples show mixed ductile/brittle failure
characteristics. There appears to be no definite correlation between
micro-scratch brittleness and quartz or total carbonate content. Dolomite
content shows a stronger correlation with brittleness than any other major
mineral group. The scratch brittleness index correlates positively with
increasing Young's modulus and decreasing Poisson's ratio, but shows deviations
in rocks with distinct porosity and with stress-sensitive brittle/ductile
behavior (Eagle Ford).

event. We fit the obtained transit light curves of each target with a
detrending model and a transit model. Furthermore, we used emcee, which is
based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, to assess the best fit posterior
distributions of each system parameter of interest. We refined the planetary
radius of WASP-140 b by approximately 12%, and we derived a better precision on
its reported asymmetric radius uncertainty by approximately 86% and 67%. We
also refined the orbital parameters of WASP-120 b by 2$\sigma$. Moreover, using

  Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Classification of long sequential data is an important Machine Learning task
and appears in many application scenarios. Recurrent Neural Networks,
Transformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks are three major techniques for
learning from sequential data. Among these methods, Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs) which are scalable to very long sequences have achieved
remarkable progress in time series regression. However, the performance of TCNs
for sequence classification is not satisfactory because they use a skewed
connection protocol and output classes at the last position. Such asymmetry
restricts their performance for classification which depends on the whole
sequence. In this work, we propose a symmetric multi-scale architecture called
Circular Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (CDIL-CNN), where every position
has an equal chance to receive information from other positions at the previous
layers. Our model gives classification logits in all positions, and we can
apply a simple ensemble learning to achieve a better decision. We have tested
CDIL-CNN on various long sequential datasets. The experimental results show
that our method has superior performance over many state-of-the-art approaches.

by the application of a magnetic field. The magnetic manipulations of
ferrofluids have been useful in augmenting heat transfer, as evident from
recent investigations. In the present study, we examine a novel strategy for
augmenting two-phase heat transfer and show that the magnetic manipulation of
non-boiling Taylor bubble flow (TBF) of ferrofluids can provide on-demand
augmentation. In an earlier investigation (DOI:10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.124589),
we had shown that the characteristics of the TBF of ferrofluids could be
altered through external magnetic manipulations. As transport characteristics
of TBFs primarily depend on their flow morphology, it was anticipated that such
alteration would affect their thermal transport characteristics, which are
examined in the present work. The generation of smaller bubbles and unit-cells
through magnetic manipulations decreases the void fraction of the resulting
TBF. In addition, a greater number of units participated in the heat exchange
process compared to larger bubble-slug systems at any time instance. Such flow
modifications cause considerable augmentation (which can go up to 100%) in
two-phase heat transfer. The extent of augmentation depends on the applied
magnetic field and induced magnetic force, homogeneous gas fraction, liquid
film thickness/void fraction and flow morphology of the resulting TBF, which
are examined in the present study. The application of ferrofluids in TBFs
provides multiple benefits, such as suspension of nanoparticles with better
thermal properties and additional functionality of the flow manipulations
through external means. The proposed application with the suggested
manipulation technique provides an effective alternative for an on-demand
augmentation in two-phase heat transfer in low Reynolds number flows.

tasks quickly and efficiently. Soft continuum manipulators do not currently
consider dynamic parameters when operating in task space. This shortcoming
makes existing soft robots slow and limits their ability to deal with external
forces, especially during object manipulation. We address this issue by using
dynamic operational space control. Our control approach takes into account the
dynamic parameters of the 3D continuum arm and introduces new models that
enable multi-segment soft manipulators to operate smoothly in task space.
Advanced control methods, previously afforded only to rigid robots, are now
adapted to soft robots; for example, potential field avoidance was previously
only shown for rigid robots and is now extended to soft robots. Using our
approach, a soft manipulator can now achieve a variety of tasks that were
previously not possible: we evaluate the manipulator's performance in
closed-loop controlled experiments such as pick-and-place, obstacle avoidance,
throwing objects using an attached soft gripper, and deliberately applying
forces to a surface by drawing with a grasped piece of chalk. Besides the newly
enabled skills, our approach improves tracking accuracy by 59% and increases
speed by a factor of 19.3 compared to state of the art for task space control.
With these newfound abilities, soft robots can start to challenge rigid robots
in the field of manipulation. Our inherently safe and compliant soft robot
moves the future of robotic manipulation towards a cageless setup where humans

for each prediction -- are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the need for
practitioners to rationalize their model outputs. However, comparing local
explainability methods is difficult since they each generate outputs in various
scales and dimensions. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of some
explainability methods, it is possible for different runs of a method to
produce contradictory explanations for a given observation. In this paper, we
propose a topology-based framework to extract a simplified representation from
a set of local explanations. We do so by first modeling the relationship
between the explanation space and the model predictions as a scalar function.
Then, we compute the topological skeleton of this function. This topological
skeleton acts as a signature for such functions, which we use to compare
different explanation methods. We demonstrate that our framework can not only
reliably identify differences between explainability techniques but also
provides stable representations. Then, we show how our framework can be used to
identify appropriate parameters for local explainability methods. Our framework
is simple, does not require complex optimizations, and can be broadly applied
to most local explanation methods. We believe the practicality and versatility
of our approach will help promote topology-based approaches as a tool for
understanding and comparing explanation methods.

determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) studies of the AHM on a square lattice,
from which several different quantities have been calculated and should be
useful as a roadmap to experiments. We have obtained a detailed phase diagram
for the critical superconducting temperature, $T_c$, in terms of the band
filling, $\ave{n}$, and interaction strength, $U$, from which we pinpoint a
somewhat wide region $|U|/t \approx 5 \pm 1$ ($t$ is the hopping amplitude) and
$\ave{n} \approx 0.79 \pm 0.09$ leading to a maximum $T_c \approx 0.16 t$. Two
additional temperature scales, namely pairing, $T_p$, and degeneracy, $T_d$,
have been highlighted: the former sets the scale for pair formation (believed
to be closely related to the scale for the gap of spin excitations in
cuprates), while the latter sets the scale for dominant quantum effects. Our
DQMC data for the distribution of doubly occupied sites, for the momentum
distribution function, and for the quasiparticle weight show distinctive
features on both sides of the BCS-BEC crossover, being also suggestive of an
underlying crossover between Fermi- and non-Fermi liquid behaviors.

digraph method consisting of nodes (concepts) and weights which represent the

achievements in various time series prediction applications, designing an FCM
model with time-efficient training method is still an open challenge. Thus,
this paper introduces a novel univariate time series forecasting technique,
which is composed of a group of randomized high order FCM models labeled
R-HFCM. The novelty of the proposed R-HFCM model is relevant to merging the
concepts of FCM and Echo State Network (ESN) as an efficient and particular
family of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, where the least squares algorithm is
applied to train the model. From another perspective, the structure of R-HFCM
consists of the input layer, reservoir layer, and output layer in which only
the output layer is trainable while the weights of each sub-reservoir
components are selected randomly and keep constant during the training process.
As case studies, this model considers solar energy forecasting with public data

electric load and temperature data of the power supply company of the city of
Johor in Malaysia. The experiment also includes the effect of the map size,
activation function, the presence of bias and the size of the reservoir on the

pulsating mode distribution of RR Lyrae stars on the HB shows that the bimodal
region of the instability strip is shared by RRab and RRc stars. By modelling
the mass loss at the RGB after the He flash events, we were able to represent

manifests itself in a robust period doubling response of this drive-induced

In contrast to similar alloys, such as films of Au$_{3}$Zr, the films express
more negative $\epsilon'$ values and lower $\epsilon''$ values across most of
the wavelengths (370-1570 nm) investigated. The Au$_{3}$Hf films were
fabricated by DC magnetron sputtering at a range of deposition temperatures,
from room temperature to 415$^{o}$C, and annealed at different vacuum levels.
The films mostly formed as a combination of Au$_{3}$Hf, Au$_{2}$Hf and
Au$_{4}$Hf phases when deposited below 400$^{o}$C, and exclusively Au$_{3}$Hf
phase at above 400$^{o}$C, indicating key conditions for isolating this phase.
The films were stable when annealed at 10$^{-8}$ Torr, but when annealed again
at 10$^{-6}$ Torr the films oxidised and changed into a mix of Au- Hf phases,
suggesting resistance to oxidization may be an issue for un-encapsulated

effect because of projection and correlation between different observables. We
compute the weak-lensing-like projected mass estimations of dark matter halos

that are measured as more massive than truth have higher subhalo counts. Thus,
projection along the line of sight creates cluster observables that are
correlated with cluster mass measurement deviations, which in turn creates a
mass measurement bias when the clusters are selected by this correlated
observable. We demonstrate that the bias is predicted in a forward model using
the observable-mass measurement correlation.

modeling, we replaced expensive high-fidelity (HF) model evaluations with
information fusion from two low-fidelity (LF) models. For the 1D TRISO models,
we considered three multifidelity modeling strategies: only Kriging, Kriging LF
prediction plus Kriging correction, and deep neural network (DNN) LF prediction
plus Kriging correction. While the results across these multifidelity modeling
strategies compared satisfactorily, strategies employing information fusion
from two LF models consistently called the HF model least often. Next, for the
2D TRISO model, we considered two multifidelity modeling strategies: DNN LF
prediction plus Kriging correction (data-driven) and 1D TRISO LF prediction
plus Kriging correction (physics-based). The physics-based strategy, as
expected, consistently required the fewest calls to the HF model. However, the
data-driven strategy had a lower overall simulation time since the DNN
predictions are instantaneous, and the 1D TRISO model requires a non-negligible
simulation time.

representing CNFs of bounded treewidth. For this purpose we introduce two new
structural graph parameters $d$-pathwidth and clique preserving $d$-pathwidth
denoted by $d-pw(G)$ and $d-cpw(G)$ where $G$ is a graph. We show that
$2-cpw(G) \leq O(tw(G) \Delta(G))$ where $tw(G)$ and $\Delta(G)$ are,
respectively the treewidth and maximal degree of $G$. Using this upper bound,
we demonstrate that each CNF $\psi$ can be represented as a conjunction of two
OBDDs of size $2^{O(\Delta(\psi)*tw(\psi)^2)}$ where $tw(\psi)$ is the
treewidth of the primal graph of $\psi$ and each variable occurs in $\psi$ at
most $\Delta(\psi)$ times.
  Next we use $d$-pathwdith to obtain lower bounds for monotone branching
programs. In particular, we consider the monotone version of syntactic
nondeterministic read $d$ times branching programs (just forbidding negative
literals as edge labels) and introduce a further restriction that each
computational path can be partitioned into at most $d$ read-once subpaths. We
call the resulting model separable monotone read $d$ times branching programs
and abbreviate them $d$-SMNBPs. For each graph $G$ without isolated vertices,
we introduce a CNF $\psi(G)$ whsose clauses are $(u \vee e \vee v)$ for each
edge $e=\{u,v\}$ of $G$. We prove that a $d$-SMNBP representing $\psi(G)$ is of
size at least $\Omega(c^{d-pw(G)})$ where $c=(8/7)^{1/12}$. We use this
'generic' lower bound to obtain an exponential lower bound for a 'concrete'
class of CNFs $\psi(K_n)$. In particular, we demonstrate that for each $0<a<1$,
the size of $n^{a}$-SMNBP representing $\psi(K_n)$ is at least $c^{n^b}$ where
$b$ is an arbitrary constant such that $a+b<1$. This lower bound is tight in
the sense $\psi(K_n)$ can be represented by a poly-sized $n$-SMNBP.

strain-induced tunability of the electronic and phononic properties of both
phases, and compared their stability against the applied strain. By considering
a large number of strain profiles for both tensile and compressive stress, we
have found that the electronic properties of both 2H and 1T$^{\prime}$ phases
are sensitive to the direction of the applied strain and can be tuned in a
controlled way. For the 2H phase, in most cases, a direct to indirect band gap
transition at lower strain and a semiconductor to metal transition at higher
strain is observed. The applied strain destroys the semimetallic nature of the
1T$^{\prime}$ phase via the overlapping of the bulk states with the
topologically protected edge states. Significant strain-induced changes in the
phononic properties, in the frequency of the phonon branches, as well as in the
nature of the dispersion curves, are observed. A systematic change in the
frequency of the optical phonon modes at the zone centre is seen for both
phases. With increasing strain, the out-of-plane acoustic mode (ZA) turns
imaginary, indicating a possibility of phase transition or instability of the
crystal structure. The 2H phase appears to withstand a larger amount of strain
and therefore possesses better stability compared to the 1T$^{\prime}$ phase
since the imaginary branch starts to appear at much lower values of strain in
the latter case. We highlight the significance of strain engineering in tuning
the electronic and phononic properties and the safe limit of the strain
application in different polymorphs of single-layer MoS$_{2}$.

systems. We analyzed 83 open-source systems relying on relational databases as
well as 19 systems relying on NoSQL databases. We detected SATD in source code
comments obtained from different snapshots of the subject systems. To
understand the evolution dynamics of SATDs, we conducted a survival analysis.
Next, we performed a manual analysis of 361 sample data-access SATDs,
investigating the composition of data-access SATDs and the reasons behind their
introduction and removal. We identified 15 new SATD categories, out of which 11
are specific to database access operations. We found that most of the
data-access SATDs are introduced in the later stages of change history rather
than at the beginning. We also observed that bug fixing and refactoring are the
main reasons behind the introduction of data-access SATDs.

agent to adopt a policy from a set of admissible policies. The goal of the
reward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently
while ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the
new reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward
function. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward
poisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the
reward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are
inadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the
problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward
design problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging,
and it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then
proceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates
the optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more
amenable to optimization techniques and analysis. For this surrogate problem,
we present characterization results that provide bounds on the value of the
optimal solution. Finally, we design a local search algorithm to solve the
surrogate problem and showcase its utility using simulation-based experiments.

X-ray binaries can be determined from the binary mass function, providing
independent constraints are placed on both the binary inclination and mass
ratio. In eclipsing systems, they relate via the totality duration. EXO
0748-676 is an eclipsing NS low mass X-ray binary with a binary mass function
estimated using stellar emission lines from the irradiated face of the
companion. The NS mass is thus known as a function of mass ratio. Here we model
the X-ray eclipses in several energy bands, utilising archival XMM-Newton data.
We find a narrow region of absorbing material surrounding the companion star is
required to explain the energy-dependent eclipses. Therefore, we suggest the
companion may be experiencing ablation of its outer layers and that the system
could transition into a redback millisecond pulsar. Our fit returns a mass
ratio of $q=0.222^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ and an inclination $i = 76.5
\pm^{1.4}_{1.1}$. Combining these with the previously measured radial velocity
of $410 \pm 5$ km/s, derived from Doppler mapping analysis of H$_\alpha$
emission during quiescence, returns a NS mass of $\sim 2 M_\odot$ even if the
line originates as far from the NS as physically possible, favouring hard EoS.
The inferred mass increases for a more realistic emission point. However, a
$\sim 1.4 M_\odot$ canonical NS mass is possible when considering radial
velocity values derived from other emission lines observed both during outburst

the large intrinsic differences the two considered models imprint on galaxy
properties. We find that the stellar mass, stellar metallicity, and maximum

can be seen as complementary. It is also striking that these two spacetimes
have resemblances with two well-known static universes. The Minkowski-Minkowski
static closed universe resembles the Einstein universe, a static closed
spherical universe homogeneously filled with dust matter and with a
cosmological constant. The Minkowski-Minkowski static open universe resembles
the Friedmann static universe, a static open hyperbolic universe homogeneously
filled with negative energy density dust and with a negative cosmological, a
universe with two disjoint branes that can be considered a failed wormhole. In
this light, the Einstein and Friedmann universes are also two sides of the same
concept. A linear stability analysis for all these spacetimes is performed. The
complementarity between bubble universes and traversable wormholes, that exists
for these static spacetimes, can be can carried out for dynamical spacetimes,
indicating that such a complementarity is general. The study suggests that
bubble universes and traversable wormholes can be seen as coming out of the
same concept, and thus, if ones exist the others should also exist.

One
promising scenario is that magnetic fields generated during inflation, larger
than 0.1 nG on Mpc scales, were adiabatically compressed to $\mu$G strengths in
galaxies during structure formation. Thus, detecting a scale-invariant
primordial magnetic field (PMF) above 0.1 nG on Mpc scales just after
recombination would indicate an inflationary origin of galactic magnetic
fields. This would also provide compelling evidence that inflation occurred
since only an inflationary mechanism could generate such a strong,
scale-invariant magnetic field on Mpc scales. In contrast, constraining the
scale-invariant PMF strength to be below 0.1 nG would imply an inflationary
scenario is not the primary origin, since such weak PMFs cannot be amplified
enough via adiabatic compression to produce the strength of the galactic fields
we observe today. We find that measurements of anisotropic birefringence by
future CMB surveys will be able to improve the sensitivity to Mpc-scale
inflationary PMFs by an order of magnitude, and, in particular, that CMB-HD
would lower the upper bound to 0.072 nG at the 95% C.L., which is below the
critical 0.1 nG threshold for ruling out a purely inflationary origin. If
inflationary PMFs exist, we find that a CMB-HD survey would be able to detect
them with about $3\sigma$ significance or higher, providing evidence for
inflation itself.

star-forming galaxies at $0.6 < z < 1.0$ from the Large Early Galaxy
Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C). We compare this sample with low-redshift ($z \sim
0$) galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), intermediate-redshift
($z \sim 1.6$) galaxies from the Fiber Multi-Object Spectrograph (FMOS)-COSMOS
Survey, and high-redshift ($z \sim 2$) galaxies from the Keck Baryonic
Structure Survey (KBSS). At a lookback time of $6-8\ \mathrm{Gyr}$, galaxies
with stellar masses $\mathrm{log}(\mathrm{M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}}) > 10.25$ appear
remarkably similar to $z \sim 0$ galaxies in terms of their nebular excitation,
as measured using $\mathrm{[O\,III]}\lambda5008 / \mathrm{H}\beta$. There is
some evidence that $0.6 < z < 1.0$ galaxies with lower $\mathrm{M_{\ast}}$ have
higher $\mathrm{[O\,III]}\lambda5008 / \mathrm{H}\beta$ than $z \sim 0$
galaxies and are more similar to less evolved $z \sim 1.6$ and $z \sim 2$
galaxies, which are offset from the $z \sim 0$ locus at all
$\mathrm{M_{\ast}}$. We explore the impact selection effects, contributions
from active galactic nuclei, and variations in physical conditions (ionization
parameter and gas-phase oxygen abundance) have on the apparent distribution of
$\mathrm{[O\,III]}\lambda5008 / \mathrm{H}\beta$ and find somewhat higher
ionization and lower enrichment in $0.6 < z < 1.0$ galaxies with lower
$\mathrm{M_{\ast}}$ relative to $z \sim 0$ galaxies. We use new near-infrared
spectroscopic observations of $N = 53$ LEGA-C galaxies to investigate other
probes of enrichment and excitation. Our analysis demonstrates the importance
of obtaining complete rest-optical spectra of galaxies in order to disentangle
these effects.

'radio-quiet' (log [L(1.4 GHz)/(W/Hz)]=23.8); however, radio imaging reveals ~1
kpc low-power jets (log [Pjet/(erg/s)]=44) inclined into the plane of the
galaxy disk. We combine MUSE and ALMA observations to map stellar kinematics
and ionised and molecular gas properties. The jets are seen to drive
galaxy-wide bi-conical turbulent outflows, reaching W80 = 1000-1300 km/s, in
the ionised phase (traced via optical emission-lines), which also have
increased electron densities compared to the quiescent gas. The turbulent gas
is driven perpendicular to the jet axis and is escaping along the galaxy minor
axis, reaching 7.5 kpc on both sides. Traced via CO(3-2) emission, the
turbulent material in molecular gas phase is one-third as spatially extended
and has 3 times lower velocity-dispersion as compared to ionised gas. The jets
are seen to be strongly interacting with the interstellar medium (ISM) through
enhanced ionised emission and disturbed/depleted molecular gas at the jet
termini. We see further evidence for jet-induced feedback through significantly
higher stellar velocity-dispersion aligned, and co-spatial with, the jet axis
(<5 deg). We discuss possible negative and positive feedback scenarios arising
due to the interaction of the low-power jets with the ISM in the context of
recent jet-ISM interaction simulations, which qualitatively agree with our

minihaloes (i.e. haloes with mass below $10^8$ M$_{\odot}$), we obtain
stringent constraints on both $m_{\rm nCDM}$ and $f_{\rm nCDM}$ that go well
beyond current limits. Regarding the special case of $f_{\rm nCDM}\sim 1$, for
example, we find a constraint of $m_{\rm nCDM}>15$ keV (thermal mass) for

opposite case of dominating cold DM, we find that at most one percent of the

wavelength bins. The resulting transmission spectrum, spanning a wavelength
range of $3800 - 7140$ Angstrom, exhibits a sodium absorption with a

the prevalence and evolution of SQL code smells in open-source, data-intensive
systems. We collected 150 projects and examined both traditional and SQL code
smells in these projects. Our investigation delivers several important
findings. First, SQL code smells are indeed prevalent in data-intensive
software systems. Second, SQL code smells have a weak co-occurrence with
traditional code smells. Third, SQL code smells have a weaker association with
bugs than that of traditional code smells. Fourth, SQL code smells are more
likely to be introduced at the beginning of the project lifetime and likely to
be left in the code without a fix, compared to traditional code smells.
Overall, our results show that SQL code smells are indeed prevalent and
persistent in the studied data-intensive software systems. Developers should be
aware of these smells and consider detecting and refactoring SQL code smells
and traditional code smells separately, using dedicated tools.

maps between function spaces in the form of neural networks. Differently from
classical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a
known partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input
parameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map
of a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so
far restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning
hidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural
operator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is
resolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of
handling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and
classifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network
as a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of
infinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose
stability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with
integral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range
dependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of
node-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance
with neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network
dynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN's optimal parameters
from shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep
initialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods
in both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and
generalize well to different resolutions and depths.

adopting positions and attracting potential voters in political campaigns.
Opinion polarization, bias, targeted diffusion, and the radicalization of
postures are key elements for understanding voting dynamics. In particular,
social bots are a new element that can have a pronounced effect on the
formation of opinions during elections by, for instance, creating fake accounts
in social networks to manipulate elections. Here we propose a voter model
incorporating bots and radical or intolerant individuals in the decision-making
process. The dynamics of the system occur in a multiplex network of interacting
agents composed of two layers, one for the dynamics of opinions where agents
choose between two possible alternatives, and the other for the tolerance
dynamics, in which agents adopt one of two tolerance levels. The tolerance
accounts for the likelihood to change opinion in an interaction, with tolerant
(intolerant) agents switching opinion with probability $1.0$ ($\gamma \le 1$).
We find that intolerance leads to a consensus of tolerant agents during an
initial stage that scales as $\tau^+ \sim \gamma^{-1} \ln N$, who then reach an
opinion consensus during the second stage in a time that scales as $\tau \sim
N$, where $N$ is the number of agents. Therefore, very intolerant agents
($\gamma \ll 1$) could considerably slow down dynamics towards the final
consensus state. We also find that the inclusion of a fraction
$\sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^-$ of bots breaks the symmetry between both opinions,
driving the system to a consensus of intolerant agents with the bots' opinion.
Thus, bots eventually impose their opinion to the entire population, in a time
that scales as $\tau_B^- \sim \gamma^{-1}$ for $\gamma \ll
\sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^-$ and $\tau_B^- \sim 1/\sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^-$ for
$\sigma_{\mathbb{B}}^- \ll \gamma$.

upcoming {\gamma}-ray surveys will detect. Therefore, accurate modelling of
their global emission properties is one of the most urgent problems in
high-energy astrophysics. Correctly characterizing these dominant objects is a
needed step to allow {\gamma}-ray surveys to detect fainter sources,
investigate the signatures of cosmic-ray propagation and estimate the diffuse
emission in the Galaxy. In this paper we present an observationally motivated
construction of the Galactic PWNe population. We made use of a modified
one-zone model to evolve for a long period of time the entire population. The
model provides, for every source, at any age, a simplified description of the
dynamical and spectral evolution. The long term effects of the reverberation
phase on the spectral evolution are described, for the first time, based on
physically motivated prescriptions for the evolution of the nebular radius
supported by numerical studies. This effort tries to solve one of the most
critical aspects of one-zone modeling, namely the typical overcompression of
the nebula during the reverberation phase, resulting in a strong modification
of its spectral properties at all frequencies. We compare the emission
properties of our synthetic Pulsar Wind Nebulae population with the most
updated catalogues of TeV Galactic sources. We find that the firmly identified
and candidate PWNe sum up to about 50% of the expected objects in this class
above threshold for detection. Finally, we estimate that CTA will increase the
number of TeV detected PWNe by a factor$\geq3$.

our results with the predictions of Paper I. We use Gadget-2 to follow the
evolution of the system while the field is weak. We introduce a new method for
treating kinematic fields by tracking the evolution of the deformation tensor.
The growth rate in this stage of the simulation is lower than expected for
diffuse astrophysical plasmas, which have a very low resistivity (high magnetic
Prandtl number); we attribute this to the large numerical resistivity in
simulations, corresponding to a magnetic Prandtl number of order unity. When
the magnetic field begins to be dynamically significant in the core of the
minihalo at z=27, we map it onto a uniform grid and follow the evolution in an
adaptive mesh refinement, MHD simulation in Orion2. The nonlinear evolution of
the field in the Orion2 simulation violates flux-freezing and is consistent
with the theory proposed by Xu & Lazarian. The fields approach equipartition
with kinetic energy at densities ~ 10^10 - 10^12 cm^-3. When the same
calculation is carried out in Orion2 with no magnetic fields, several
protostars form, ranging in mass from ~ 1 to 30 M_sol with magnetic fields,
only a single ~ 30 M_sol protostar forms by the end of the simulation. Magnetic
fields thus suppress the formation of low-mass Pop III stars, yielding a
top-heavy Pop III IMF and contributing to the absence of observed Pop III
stars.

the major steps of quasi-static ultrasound elastography, which detects tissue

optimization-based techniques, a prominent class of TDE algorithms, optimize a
non-linear energy functional consisting of data constancy and spatial
continuity constraints to obtain the displacement and strain maps between the
time-series frames under consideration. The existing optimization-based TDE

regularizer. However, such a formulation over-penalizes the displacement
irregularity and poses two major issues to the estimated strain field. First,
the boundaries between different tissues are blurred. Second, the visual
contrast between the target and the background is suboptimal. To resolve these
issues, herein, we propose a novel TDE algorithm where instead of L2-, L1-norms
of both first- and second-order displacement derivatives are taken into account

mechanism based on feature points ignores the feature multi-manifold
distribution, where each feature manifold corresponds to a semantic region in
the image. Consequently, a uniform content semantic region is rendered by
highly different patterns from various style semantic regions, producing
inconsistent stylization results with visual artifacts. We proposed the
progressive attentional manifold alignment (PAMA) to alleviate this problem,
which repeatedly applies attention operations and space-aware interpolations.
The attention operation rearranges style features dynamically according to the
spatial distribution of content features. This makes the content and style
manifolds correspond on the feature map. Then the space-aware interpolation
adaptively interpolates between the corresponding content and style manifolds
to increase their similarity. By gradually aligning the content manifolds to
style manifolds, the proposed PAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance while
avoiding the inconsistency of semantic regions. Codes are available at

the difference in charge radii between a mirror pair, R_mir, is an inferior

models by comparing the accuracy of noisy circuit simulations with the
corresponding experimental observations. We find that the agreement of noise
model to experiment does not correlate with the information gained by
characterization and that the underlying circuit strongly influences the best
choice of characterization approach. Empirical direct characterization scales
best of the methods we tested and produced the most accurate characterizations
across our benchmarks.

pre-specified penalties or by constructing a penalty based on the data. If a
list of penalties for a class of linear models is given, we provide comparisons
based on sample size and number of non-zero parameters under a predictive
stability criterion based on data perturbation. These comparisons provide
recommendations for penalty selection in a variety of settings. If the
preference is to construct a penalty customized for a given problem, then we
propose a technique based on genetic algorithms, again using a predictive
criterion. We find that, in general, a custom penalty never performs worse than
any commonly used penalties but that there are cases the custom penalty reduces
to a recognizable penalty. Since penalty selection is mathematically equivalent
to prior selection, our method also constructs priors.
  The techniques and recommendations we offer are intended for finite sample
cases. In this context, we argue that predictive stability under perturbation
is one of the few relevant properties that can be invoked when the true model
is not known. Nevertheless, we study variable inclusion in simulations and, as
part of our shrinkage selection strategy, we include oracle property
considerations. In particular, we see that the oracle property typically holds
for penalties that satisfy basic regularity conditions and therefore is not
restrictive enough to play a direct role in penalty selection. In addition, our
real data example also includes considerations merging from model
mis-specification.

as depth of the QAOA ansatz, gate infidelities, and inverse hardware graph
degree. These problems may be alleviated by increasing hardware connectivity or
by recently proposed modifications to the QAOA that achieve higher performance

dynamics on graphs. A single ""mutant"" (e.g., a new opinion, strain, social
trait etc.) invades a population of residents spread over the nodes of a graph.
The mutant fitness advantage $\delta\geq 0$ determines how aggressively mutants
propagate to their neighbors. The quantity of interest is the fixation
probability, i.e., the probability that the initial mutant eventually takes
over the whole population. However, in realistic settings, the invading mutant
has an advantage only in certain locations. E.g., a bacterial mutation allowing
for lactose metabolism only confers an advantage on places where dairy products
are present. In this paper we introduce the positional Moran process, a natural
generalization in which the mutant fitness advantage is only realized on
specific nodes called active nodes. The associated optimization problem is
fixation maximization: given a budget $k$, choose a set of $k$ active nodes
that maximize the fixation probability of the invading mutant. We show that the
problem is NP-hard, while the optimization function is not submodular, thus
indicating strong computational hardness. Then we focus on two natural limits.
In the limit of $\delta\to\infty$ (strong selection), although the problem
remains NP-hard, the optimization function becomes submodular and thus admits a
constant-factor approximation using a simple greedy algorithm. In the limit of
$\delta\to 0$ (weak selection), we show that in $O(m^\omega)$ time we can
obtain a tight approximation, where $m$ is the number of edges and $\omega$ is
the matrix-multiplication exponent. Finally, we present an experimental
evaluation of the new algorithms together with some proposed heuristics.

high-mass black holes that are difficult to form in stellar collapse models due

between neutron stars and the lightest observed black holes. We infer source
parameters in the upper and lower black hole mass gaps with both extreme and

process is trained to return the highest-quality control that reaches a local
goal state (i.e., a waypoint) in the absence of obstacles from an input
difference vector between its current state and a local goal state. The data
generation scheme provides bounds on the target dispersion and uses state space
pruning to ensure high-quality controls. By focusing on the system's dynamics,
this process is data efficient and takes place once for a dynamical system, so
that it can be used for different environments with modular expansion
functions. This work integrates the proposed learning process with a) an
exploratory expansion function that generates waypoints with biased coverage
over the reachable space, and b) proposes an exploitative expansion function
for mobile robots, which generates waypoints using medial axis information.
This paper evaluates the learning process and the corresponding planners for a
first and second-order differential drive systems. The results show that the
proposed integration of learning and planning can produce better quality paths
than kinodynamic planning with random controls in fewer iterations and

often fail to generalize to more challenging real data domains. In this paper,
we attempt to unfold an important factor that hinders the networks from
generalizing across domains: through the lens of shortcut learning. We
demonstrate that the learning of feature representations in stereo matching
networks is heavily influenced by synthetic data artefacts (shortcut
attributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic
Shortcut Avoidance~(ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related
information from being encoded into the feature representations. As a result,
our proposed method learns robust and shortcut-invariant features by minimizing
the sensitivity of latent features to input variations. To avoid the
prohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity optimization, we
propose an effective yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. We show that
using this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks that are trained
purely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging and
previously unseen real data scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method
enhances the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the point that
they outperform their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging
out-of-domain stereo datasets.

potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to
understanding, mitigating and preventing current and future pandemics. In
coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is an important part
of determining host specificity since it is the point of contact between the

five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating
them into clusters of distinct hosts among avians, bats, camels, swines, humans

generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these

biological applications such as determining protein function, or identifying
transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our
knowledge) to use PWMs in the context of host classification from viral
sequences to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation. The results
on the real world data show that in using PWM2Vec, we are able to perform
comparably well as compared to baseline models. We also measure the importance
of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which
are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus.

suggesting that unconstrained minimization of the mean square error is an
inadequate approach to filter design. To address this, we first develop a
unifying framework for studying constrained LMMSE estimation problems. Using
this framework, we explore an important structural property of constrained
LMMSE filters involving a certain prefilter. Optimality is invariant under
invertible linear transformations of the prefilter. This parameterizes all
optimal filters by equivalence classes of prefilters. We then clarify that
merely constraining the rank of the filter does not suitably address the
problem of ill-conditioning. Instead, we adopt a constraint that explicitly
requires solutions to be well-conditioned in a certain specific sense. We
introduce two well-conditioned filters and show that they converge to the
unconstrained LMMSE filter as their truncation-power loss goes to zero, at the
same rate as the low-rank Wiener filter. We also show extensions to the case of
weighted trace and determinant of the error covariance as objective functions.
Finally, our quantitative results with historical VIX data demonstrate that our
two well-conditioned filters have stable performance while the standard LMMSE
filter deteriorates with increasing condition number.

sparing normal tissue, however, the mechanism of the differential tissue
sparing effect is still not known. Oxygen has long been known to profoundly
impact radiobiological responses, and radiolytic oxygen depletion has been
considered to be a possible cause or contributor to the FLASH phenomenon. This
work investigates the impact of tissue pO2 profiles, oxygen depletion per unit
dose (g), and the oxygen concentration yielding half-maximal radiosensitization
(k) in tumor and normal tissue. We developed a model that considers the
dependent relationship between oxygen depletion and change of radiosensitivity
during FLASH irradiation. Cell survival was calculated based on the LQ-L model
and the radiosensitivity related parameters were adjusted while delivering
fractional doses of FLASH irradiation The model reproduced published
experimental data and was used to analyze the impact of parameter uncertainties
on the radiobiological responses. This study expands the oxygen depletion
analysis of FLASH to normal human tissue and tumor based on clinically
determined aggregate and individual patient pO2 profiles. The results show that
the pO2 profile is the most essential factor that affects biological response
and analyses based on the median pO2 rather than the full pO2 profile can be
unreliable and misleading. Additionally, the presence of a small fraction of
cells on the threshold of radiobiologic hypoxia substantially alters biological
response to FLASH irradiation. We found that an increment in the k value is
generally more protective of tumor than normal tissue due to a higher frequency
of lower pO2 values in tumors. Variation in the g value affects the dose at
which oxygen depletion impacts response, but does not alter the dose dependent
response trends, if the g value is identical in both tumor and normal tissue.

(SOC) estimation at the charge-end. Two main characteristics make the
charge-end time span a good opportunity to correct SOC estimation: first, it is
easy to detect when the battery is at the last stage of charging because the
charging profile is known to the BMS designer and also during the charge-end
time span the amount of current is low, and the terminal voltage of the battery
cells are high; second, as the battery reaches the charge-end stage, we know
that the true SOC is approaching to 100%. This paper presents a method to
utilize these important features to correct the SOC estimation error. Using a
voltage threshold method, the algorithm detects when the battery is close to
the charge-end to activate the charge-end SOC correction strategy. Once
activated, the strategy corrects the SOC using the maximum cell voltage to

  Accurate Training of Neural Networks",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We develop the ""generalized consistent weighted sampling"" (GCWS) for hashing
the ""powered-GMM"" (pGMM) kernel (with a tuning parameter $p$). It turns out
that GCWS provides a numerically stable scheme for applying power
transformation on the original data, regardless of the magnitude of $p$ and the
data. The power transformation is often effective for boosting the performance,
in many cases considerably so. We feed the hashed data to neural networks on a
variety of public classification datasets and name our method ``GCWSNet''. Our
extensive experiments show that GCWSNet often improves the classification
accuracy. Furthermore, it is evident from the experiments that GCWSNet
converges substantially faster. In fact, GCWS often reaches a reasonable
accuracy with merely (less than) one epoch of the training process. This
property is much desired because many applications, such as advertisement
click-through rate (CTR) prediction models, or data streams (i.e., data seen
only once), often train just one epoch. Another beneficial side effect is that
the computations of the first layer of the neural networks become additions
instead of multiplications because the input data become binary (and highly
sparse).
  Empirical comparisons with (normalized) random Fourier features (NRFF) are
provided. We also propose to reduce the model size of GCWSNet by count-sketch
and develop the theory for analyzing the impact of using count-sketch on the
accuracy of GCWS. Our analysis shows that an ``8-bit'' strategy should work
well in that we can always apply an 8-bit count-sketch hashing on the output of
GCWS hashing without hurting the accuracy much. There are many other ways to
take advantage of GCWS when training deep neural networks. For example, one can
apply GCWS on the outputs of the last layer to boost the accuracy of trained
deep neural networks.

appropriate delays for information-bearing symbols at the transmitter side, so
that after propagating over the time-dispersive channel, all multi-path signal
components will arrive at the receiver simultaneously and constructively. We
first show that by applying DAM for the basic multiple-input single-output

Furthermore, the more general DAM scheme is studied with the ISI-maximal-ratio

electrons accelerated remains unclear. Here we present the first model of the
double coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources, where electrons are accelerated by a
pair of termination shocks driven by bi-directional fast reconnection outflows.
We model the acceleration and transport of electrons in the flare region by
numerically solving the Parker transport equation using velocity and magnetic
fields from the macroscopic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a flux rope
eruption. We show that electrons can be efficiently accelerated by the
termination shocks and high-energy electrons mainly concentrate around the two
shocks. The synthetic HXR emission images display two distinct sources
extending to $>$100 keV below and above the reconnection region, with the upper
source much fainter than the lower one. The HXR energy spectra of the two
coronal sources show similar spectral slopes, consistent with the observations.
Our simulation results suggest that the flare termination shock can be a
promising particle acceleration mechanism in explaining the double-source
nonthermal emissions in solar flares.

longitudinal muon-spin relaxation $\lambda_\mathrm{L}(T)$, an indication of the
rate of spin fluctuations, diverges near the onset of AFM order, followed by a
significant drop at $T < T_\mathrm{N}$. In the AFM state, spin fluctuations are
much stronger in EuAl$_4$ than in EuGa$_4$, while being comparable in the PM

based on varying degrees, where at each time step a node might get, with
probability $r$, a new degree and new neighbors according to a given degree
distribution, instead of its former neighbors. We find analytically, using the
generating functions framework, the epidemic threshold and the probability for
a macroscopic spread of disease depending on the rewiring rate $r$. Our
analytical results are supported by numerical simulations. We find surprisingly
that the impact of the rewiring rate $r$ has qualitative different trends for
networks having different degree distributions. That is, in some structures,
such as random regular networks the dynamics enhances the epidemic spreading
while in others such as scale free the dynamics reduces the spreading. In
addition, for scale-free networks, we reveal that fast dynamics of the network,
$r=1$, changes the epidemic threshold to nonzero rather than zero found for
$r<1$, which is similar to the known case of $r=0$, i.e., a static network.
Finally, we find the epidemic threshold also for a general distribution of the

at pre-planned interim analyses. The difference between the two designs lies in
the way that participants are sequentially recruited. Given a maximum number of
clusters as well as maximum cluster size allowed in the trial, one design
sequentially recruits clusters with the given maximum cluster size, while the
other recruits all clusters at the beginning of the trial but sequentially
enrolls individual participants until the trial is stopped early for efficacy

call Open-World Proposals(OWP), but this comes at the cost of a big drop on the
classification task when both tasks are considered in the detection model.
These works have investigated two-stage Region Proposal Networks (RPN) by
taking advantage of objectness scoring cues; however, for its simplicity,
run-time, and decoupling of localization and classification, we investigate OWP
through the lens of fully convolutional one-stage detection network, such as
FCOS. We show that our architectural and sampling optimizations on FCOS can
increase OWP performance by as much as 6% in recall on novel classes, marking
the first proposal-free one-stage detection network to achieve comparable
performance to RPN-based two-stage networks. Furthermore, we show that the
inherent, decoupled architecture of FCOS has benefits to retaining
classification performance. While two-stage methods worsen by 6% in recall on
novel classes, we show that FCOS only drops 2% when jointly optimizing for OWP
and classification.

transferring and exploiting common knowledge among tasks. Existing MTL works
mainly focus on the scenario where label sets among multiple tasks (MTs) are

While almost rare works explore the scenario where each task only has a small
amount of training samples, and their label sets are just partially overlapped

information available among these tasks. For this, we propose a framework to
learn these tasks by jointly leveraging both abundant information from a learnt
auxiliary big task with sufficiently many classes to cover those of all these
tasks and the information shared among those partially-overlapped tasks. In our
implementation of using the same neural network architecture of the learnt

joint learning across individual tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate
its effectiveness in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.

However, most existing deep learning-based recommender systems are designed for
modeling singular type of user-item interaction behavior, which can hardly
distill the heterogeneous relations between user and item. In practical
recommendation scenarios, there exist multityped user behaviors, such as browse
and purchase. Due to the overlook of user's multi-behavioral patterns over
different items, existing recommendation methods are insufficient to capture
heterogeneous collaborative signals from user multi-behavior data. Inspired by
the strength of graph neural networks for structured data modeling, this work
proposes a Graph Neural Multi-Behavior Enhanced Recommendation (GNMR) framework
which explicitly models the dependencies between different types of user-item
interactions under a graph-based message passing architecture. GNMR devises a
relation aggregation network to model interaction heterogeneity, and
recursively performs embedding propagation between neighboring nodes over the
user-item interaction graph. Experiments on real-world recommendation datasets
show that our GNMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The

It is known
that if $G$ is amenable then $R$ satisfies the Ore condition: for any $a,b\in
R$ there exist $u,v\in R$ such that $au=bv$, where $u\ne0$ or $v\ne0$. It is
also true for amenable groups that a non-zero solution exists for any finite
system of linear equations over $R$, where the number of unknowns exceeds the
number of equations. Recently Bartholdi proved the converse. As a consequence
of this theorem, Kielak proved that R.\,Thompson's group $F$ is amenable if and
only if it satisfies the Ore condition. The amenability problem for $F$ is a
long-standing open question.
  In this paper we prove that some equations or their systems have non-zero
solutions in the group rings of $F$. We improve some results by Donnelly
showing that there exist finite sets $Y\subset F$ with the property $|AY| <
\frac43|Y|$, where $A=\{x_0,x_1,x_2\}$. This implies some result on the systems
of equations. We show that for any element $b$ in the group ring of $F$, the
equation $(1-x_0)u=bv$ has a non-zero solution. The corresponding fact for
$1-x_1$ instead of $1-x_0$ remains open. We deduce that for any $m\ge1$ the
system $(1-x_0)u_0=(1-x_1)u_1=\cdots=(1-x_m)u_m$ has nonzero solutions in the
group ring of $F$. We also analyze the equation $(1-x_0)u=(1-x_1)v$ giving a
precise explicit description of all its solutions in $K[F]$. This is important
since to any group relation between $x_0$, $x_1$ in $F$ one can naturally
assign such a solution. So this can help to estimate the number of relations of
a given length between generators.

vehicles, providing mobility as a service to a set of time-specified customers,
where the operator needs to solve the routing and charging problem jointly for
each EV. Hereby we consider incentive-aware customers and propose that the
operator offers monetary incentives to customers in exchange for time
flexibility. In this way, the fleet operator can achieve a routing and charging
schedule with lower costs, whilst the customers receive monetary compensation
for their flexibility. Specifically, we first propose a bi-level optimization
model whereby the fleet operator optimizes the routing and charging schedule
accounting for the spatio-temporal varying charging price, jointly with a
monetary incentive to reimburse the delivery time flexibility experienced by
the customers. Concurrently the customers choose their own time flexibility by
minimizing their own cost. Second, we cope with the computational burden coming
from this nonlinear bi-level optimization model with an accurate reformulation
approach consisting of the KKT optimality conditions, a Big-M-based
linearization method, and the zero duality gap of convex optimization problems.
This way, we convert the proposed problem into a single-level optimization
problem, which can be solved by a strengthened generalized Benders
decomposition method holding a faster convergence rate than the generalized
Benders decomposition method. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
mathematical model, we carry out numerous simulation experiments by using the
VRP-REP data of Belgium. The numerical results showcase that the proposed
mathematical model can reduce the delivery fees for the customers together with
the cost of operation incurred by the fleet operator.

classification. We start with a known source domain and conduct resource
discovery on two unseen target domains via transfer learning. We first collect
frequent queries from a set of seed documents and search on the web to obtain
candidate resources, such as lecture slides and introductory blog posts. Then
we introduce a novel pretrained information retrieval deep neural network
model, query-document masked language modeling (QD-MLM), to extract deep

decision-dependent distributions. These are problems whose objective is the
expected value of a stochastic payoff function and whose data distribution
drifts in response to decision variables--a phenomenon represented by a
distributional map. A common approach to accommodating distributional shift is
to retrain optimal decisions once a new distribution is revealed, or repeated
retraining. We introduce the notion of equilibrium points, which are the fixed
points of this repeated retraining procedure, and provide sufficient conditions
for their existence and uniqueness. To find equilibrium points, we develop
deterministic and stochastic primal-dual algorithms and demonstrate their
convergence with constant step-size in the former and polynomial decay
step-size schedule in the latter. By modeling errors emerging from a stochastic
gradient estimator as sub-Weibull random variables, we provide error bounds in
expectation and in high probability that hold for each iteration. Without
additional knowledge of the distributional map, computing saddle points is
intractable. Thus we propose a condition on the distributional map--which we
call opposing mixture dominance--that ensures that the objective is
strongly-convex-strongly-concave. Finally, we demonstrate that derivative-free
algorithms with a single function evaluation are capable of approximating
saddle points

pre-processing module and the consequent high-level task such as object
detection would fail. Here, we propose a novel framework, RestoreDet, to detect
objects in degraded low resolution images. RestoreDet utilizes the downsampling
degradation as a kind of transformation for self-supervised signals to explore
the equivariant representation against various resolutions and other
degradation conditions. Specifically, we learn this intrinsic visual structure
by encoding and decoding the degradation transformation from a pair of original
and randomly degraded images. The framework could further take the advantage of
advanced SR architectures with an arbitrary resolution restoring decoder to
reconstruct the original correspondence from the degraded input image. Both the
representation learning and object detection are optimized jointly in an
end-to-end training fashion. RestoreDet is a generic framework that could be
implemented on any mainstream object detection architectures. The extensive

class of non-cooperative convex games under partial information. Specifically,
each agent has access only to its own smooth local cost function and can
receive information from its neighbors in a time-varying directed communication
network. To this end, we propose a distributed gradient play algorithm to
compute a NE by utilizing local information exchange among the players. In this
algorithm, every agent performs a gradient step to minimize its own cost
function while sharing and retrieving information locally among its neighbors.
The existing methods impose strong assumptions such as balancedness of the
mixing matrices and global knowledge of the network communication structure,
including Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the adjacency matrix and other graph
connectivity constants. In contrast, our approach relies only on a reasonable
and widely-used assumption of row-stochasticity of the mixing matrices. We
analyze the algorithm for time-varying directed graphs and prove its
convergence to the NE, when the agents' cost functions are strongly convex and
have Lipschitz continuous gradients. Numerical simulations are performed for a
Nash-Cournot game to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

  Crystal Elastomers","submitted revised manuscript",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Photoactive liquid crystal elastomers are polymer networks of liquid crystal
mesogens embedded with chromophores like azobenzene. They undergo large
deformation when illuminated by light of a certain wavelength through
photochemical reaction, inspiring exciting new applications. However, despite
the recent progresses in both the experiment and theory of these materials, the
fundamental understanding of the temperature effect on their photomechanical
actuation through various molecular-to-mesoscale processes have remained
largely unexplored. This paper constructs a theoretical model to investigate
this temperature-modulated photomechanical actuation, by integrating different
temperature-dependent processes into a continuum framework. The model studies a
special working condition where the material is subjected to a uniaxial tensile
load, a prescribed temperature, and a polarized light illumination. We explore
the free energy landscape of the system and the uniaxial stress-stretch
responses under various conditions. We exploit the coupling between individual
controls of temperature and light in a single photomechanical actuation for
several working scenarios, including the temperature-modulated photomechanical
snap-through instability, specific work, and blocking stress. We study the
effect of the temperature-dependent backward isomerization of chromophores on
the photomechanical actuation. These results are hoped to motivate future
fundamental studies and new applications of various photomechanical material
systems.

online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm, which has been successfully
adopted in particular cases in which the time series of interest has a fixed
baseline. However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline
irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original
BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is
degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from
the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD
algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly
shifting toward unknown values but also visualize why the proposed extension

methods routinely adopt either pointwise or pairwise loss to train the model
parameters, while rarely pay attention to softmax loss due to the high
computational cost. Sampled softmax loss emerges as an efficient substitute for
softmax loss. Its special case, InfoNCE loss, has been widely used in
self-supervised learning and exhibited remarkable performance for contrastive
learning. Nonetheless, limited studies use sampled softmax loss as the learning
objective to train the recommender. Worse still, none of them explore its
properties and answer ""Does sampled softmax loss suit for item recommendation?""
and ""What are the conceptual advantages of sampled softmax loss, as compared
with the prevalent losses?"", to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we aim
to better understand sampled softmax loss for item recommendation.
Specifically, we first theoretically reveal three model-agnostic advantages:
(1) mitigating popularity bias, which is beneficial to long-tail
recommendation; (2) mining hard negative samples, which offers informative
gradients to optimize model parameters; and (3) maximizing the ranking metric,
which facilitates top-K performance. Moreover, we probe the model-specific
characteristics on the top of various recommenders. Experimental results
suggest that sampled softmax loss is more friendly to history and graph-based
recommenders (e.g., SVD++ and LightGCN), but performs poorly for ID-based
models (e.g., MF). We ascribe this to its shortcoming in learning
representation magnitude, making the combination with the models that are also
incapable of adjusting representation magnitude learn poor representations. In
contrast, the history- and graph-based models, which naturally adjust
representation magnitude according to node degree, are able to compensate for
the shortcoming of sampled softmax loss.

in a bluff body stabilized turbulent combustor through delayed acoustic
self-feedback. Such feedback control is achieved by coupling the acoustic field
of the combustor to itself through a single coupling tube attached near the
anti-node position of the acoustic standing wave. We observe that the amplitude
and dominant frequency of the limit cycle oscillations gradually decrease as
the length of the coupling tube is increased. Complete suppression (AD) of
these oscillations is observed when the length of the coupling tube is nearly
3/8 times the wavelength of the fundamental acoustic mode of the combustor.
Meanwhile, as we approach this state of amplitude death, the dynamical behavior
of acoustic pressure changes from the state of limit cycle oscillations to
low-amplitude chaotic oscillations via intermittency. We also study the change
in the nature of the coupling between the unsteady flame dynamics and the
acoustic field as the length of the coupling tube is increased. We find that
the temporal synchrony between these oscillations changes from the state of
synchronized periodicity to desynchronized aperiodicity through intermittent
synchronization. Furthermore, we reveal that the application of delayed
acoustic self-feedback with optimum feedback parameters completely disrupts the
positive feedback loop between hydrodynamic, acoustic, and heat release rate
fluctuations present in the combustor during thermoacoustic instability, thus
mitigating instability. We anticipate this method to be a viable and
cost-effective option to mitigate thermoacoustic oscillations in turbulent
combustion systems used in practical propulsion and power systems.

on a novel base non-conformity measure and a new aggregation method, used in
the inductive conformal anomaly detection framework, thereby guaranteeing a
bounded false detection rate. We demonstrate the efficacy of iDECODe by

establishes the dynamical functional connectivity that transitions in a

transition facilitates the entire brain network as a dynamical system and what
utility this mechanism for dynamic reconfiguration can bring over the widely

comparing the state transition energy under distinct adjacent matrices, we
justify that dynamic functional connectivity leads to 60% less energy cost to

the Ward-Takahashi identity. Screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons,
which are defined as the exponential decay of the corresponding spatial
correlation functions in the long distance, thus are intrinsically connected to
(inverse) magnetic catalysis of chiral condensates. To study this we performed
lattice simulations of $(2+1)$-flavor QCD on $32^3\times N_t$ lattices with
pion mass $M_\pi\simeq 220$ MeV in a fixed scale approach having temperature
$T\in[17, 281]$ MeV and magnetic field strength $eB\in[0, 2.5]$ GeV$^2$. We
find that screening lengths, i.e. inverses of screening masses of $\pi^0$,
$K^0$ and $\eta^0_{s\bar{s}}$, turn out to have the similar complex $eB$ and
$T$ dependences of the corresponding chiral condensates. Although the
transition temperature is found to always decrease as $eB$ grows, we show that
the suppression due to magnetic fields becomes less significant for hadron
screening length and chiral condensates with heavier quarks involved, and
ceases to occur for $\eta^0_{s\bar{s}}$ and strange quark chiral condensate.
The complex $eB$ and $T$ dependences of both screening masses and chiral
condensates, reflecting the crossover nature of the QCD transition, are
attributed to the competition between sea and valence quark effects. These
findings could be useful to guide low-energy models and effective theories of

shortwave-infrared (SWIR) band where clouds are highly reflective, and snow is
absorptive. As SWIR is typically of a lower resolution compared to VNIR, this
study proposes a multiresolution fully convolutional neural network (FCN) that
can effectively detect clouds and snow in VNIR images. We fuse the
multiresolution bands within a deep FCN and perform semantic segmentation at
the higher, VNIR resolution. Such a fusion-based classifier, trained in an
end-to-end manner, achieved 94.31% overall accuracy and an F1 score of 97.67%

defender to appropriate decisions, or not, when an attacker intrudes into
control systems. The model-based defense scheme considered in this study,
namely Bayesian defense mechanism, chooses reasonable reactions through
observation of the system's behavior using models of the system's stochastic
dynamics, the vulnerability to be exploited, and the attacker's objective. On
the other hand, rational attackers take deceptive strategies for misleading the
defender into making inappropriate decisions. In this paper, their dynamic
decision making is formulated as a stochastic signaling game. It is shown that
the belief of the true scenario has a limit in a stochastic sense at an
equilibrium based on martingale analysis. This fact implies that there are only
two possible cases: the defender asymptotically detects the attack with a firm
belief, or the attacker takes actions such that the system's behavior becomes
nominal after a finite time step. Consequently, if different scenarios result
in different stochastic behaviors, the Bayesian defense mechanism guarantees
the system to be secure in an asymptotic manner provided that effective
countermeasures are implemented. As an application of the finding, a defensive
deception utilizing asymmetric recognition of vulnerabilities exploited by the
attacker is analyzed. It is shown that the attacker possibly stops the attack
even if the defender is unaware of the exploited vulnerabilities as long as the
defender's unawareness is concealed by the defensive deception.

successfully curtailed by massive travel restrictions that put more than 900
million people housebound for more than two months since the lockdown of Wuhan
on 23 January 2020 when other provinces in China followed suit. Here, we assess
the impact of China's massive lockdowns and travel restrictions reflected by
the changes in mobility patterns before and during the lockdown period. We
quantify the synchrony of mobility patterns across provinces and within
provinces. Using these mobility data, we calibrate movement flow between
provinces in combination with an epidemiological compartment model to quantify
the effectiveness of lockdowns and reductions in disease transmission. Our
analysis demonstrates that the onset and phase of local community transmission
in other provinces depends on the cumulative population outflow received from
the epicenter Hubei. As such, infections can propagate further into other
interconnected places both near and far, thereby necessitating synchronous
lockdowns. Moreover, our data-driven modeling analysis shows that lockdowns and
consequently reduced mobility lag a certain time to elicit an actual impact on
slowing down the spreading and ultimately putting the epidemic under check. In
spite of the vastly heterogeneous demographics and epidemiological
characteristics across China, mobility data shows that massive travel
restrictions have been applied consistently via a top-down approach along with
high levels of compliance from the bottom up.

different from the RGB image data that are very widespread, the medical image
data used in brain tumor segmentation are relatively scarce in terms of the
data scale but contain the richer information in terms of the modality
property. To this end, this paper proposes a novel cross-modality deep feature
learning framework to segment brain tumors from the multi-modality MRI data.
The core idea is to mine rich patterns across the multi-modality data to make
up for the insufficient data scale. The proposed cross-modality deep feature
learning framework consists of two learning processes: the cross-modality
feature transition (CMFT) process and the cross-modality feature fusion (CMFF)
process, which aims at learning rich feature representations by transiting
knowledge across different modality data and fusing knowledge from different
modality data, respectively. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the

learning framework can effectively improve the brain tumor segmentation
performance when compared with the baseline methods and state-of-the-art

quantum state manipulation, and for quantum sensing, eg for creating
non-classical states which allow to achieve the quantum advantage regime. This
review collects the predictions coming from a family of exact solutions which
allows to describe the many-body wavefunction of strongly correlated quantum
fluids confined by a tight waveguide and subjected to any form of longitudinal
confinement. It directly describes the experiments with trapped ultracold atoms
where the strongly correlated regime in one dimension has been achieved. The
exact solution applies to bosons, fermions and mixtures. It allows to obtain
experimental observables such as the density profiles and momentum distribution
at all momentum scales, beyond the Luttinger liquid approach. It also predicts
the exact quantum dynamics at all the times, including the small oscillations
regime yielding the collective modes of the system and the large quench regime
where the system parameters are changed considerably. The solution can be
extended to describe finite-temperature conditions, spin and magnetization
effects. The review illustrates the idea of the solution, presents the key
theoretical achievements and the main experiments on strongly correlated
one-dimensional quantum gases.

  Shen","Motion Prediction via Joint Dependency Modeling in Phase Space",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Motion prediction is a classic problem in computer vision, which aims at
forecasting future motion given the observed pose sequence. Various deep
learning models have been proposed, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
motion prediction. However, existing methods typically focus on modeling
temporal dynamics in the pose space. Unfortunately, the complicated and high
dimensionality nature of human motion brings inherent challenges for dynamic
context capturing. Therefore, we move away from the conventional pose based
representation and present a novel approach employing a phase space trajectory
representation of individual joints. Moreover, current methods tend to only
consider the dependencies between physically connected joints. In this paper,
we introduce a novel convolutional neural model to effectively leverage
explicit prior knowledge of motion anatomy, and simultaneously capture both
spatial and temporal information of joint trajectory dynamics. We then propose
a global optimization module that learns the implicit relationships between
individual joint features.
  Empirically, our method is evaluated on large-scale 3D human motion benchmark
datasets (i.e., Human3.6M, CMU MoCap). These results demonstrate that our
method sets the new state-of-the-art on the benchmark datasets. Our code will

remove the rain streaks and accumulations in an image or video captured under a
rainy day. Existing deraining methods usually make heuristic assumptions of the
rain model, which compels them to employ complex optimization or iterative
refinement for high recovery quality. This, however, leads to time-consuming
methods and affects the effectiveness for addressing rain patterns deviated
from from the assumptions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient
deraining method by formulating deraining as a predictive filtering problem
without complex rain model assumptions. Specifically, we identify
spatially-variant predictive filtering (SPFilt) that adaptively predicts proper
kernels via a deep network to filter different individual pixels. Since the
filtering can be implemented via well-accelerated convolution, our method can
be significantly efficient. We further propose the EfDeRain+ that contains
three main contributions to address residual rain traces, multi-scale, and
diverse rain patterns without harming the efficiency. First, we propose the
uncertainty-aware cascaded predictive filtering (UC-PFilt) that can identify
the difficulties of reconstructing clean pixels via predicted kernels and
remove the residual rain traces effectively. Second, we design the
weight-sharing multi-scale dilated filtering (WS-MS-DFilt) to handle
multi-scale rain streaks without harming the efficiency. Third, to eliminate
the gap across diverse rain patterns, we propose a novel data augmentation
method (i.e., RainMix) to train our deep models. By combining all contributions
with sophisticated analysis on different variants, our final method outperforms
baseline methods on four single-image deraining datasets and one video
deraining dataset in terms of both recovery quality and speed.

Toolpath continuity has been a critical issue for extrusion-based fabrications

bumpy surfaces and get worse for materials with large inertia like clay. For
surface models, the effects of continuity are even more severe, in terms of
surface quality and model stability. In this paper, we introduce an original

can be traversed in one path considering fabrication constraints. We study the
properties of an OPP and the merging operations for OPPs, and propose a
bottom-up OPP merging procedure for decomposing the given shell surface into a
minimal number of OPPs and generating the ""as-continuous-as-possible"" (ACAP)

lead to a strong energy transfer that affects a wide range of scales $\sigma$.
We also observe that switchbacks seem to be characterized by a singular
behavior with an energy transfer varying as $\sigma^{-3/4}$, which slightly
differs from classical discontinuities characterized by a $\sigma^{-1}$
scaling. A comparison between the measurements of $\varepsilon$ and $\Dis$
shows that in general the latter is significantly larger than the former.

recently been questioned due to lack of TeV $\gamma$-ray counterparts in many
cases. Extragalactic CRs on the other hand, are thought to be associated with
accelerated particles in the relativistic jets launched by supermassive
accreting black holes at the center of galaxies. Scaled down versions of such
jets have been detected in X-ray binaries hosting a stellar black hole (BHXBs).
In this work, we investigate the possibility that the smaller-scale jets in
transient outbursts of low-mass BHXBs could be sources of Galactic CRs. To
better test this scenario, we model the entire electromagnetic spectrum of such
sources focusing on the potential TeV regime, using the `canonical' low-mass
BHXB GX 339-4 as a benchmark. Taking into account both the leptonic radiative
processes and the $\gamma$-rays produced via neutral pion decay from inelastic

to spokes-like patterns similar to those found on scallop shells instead of

the curvature that entails variations in the evaporation flux across the

contrary, the stretched LBs exhibit pinned contact lines. We decipher a
proposition that a drying liquid thin film present during dewetting near the
three-phase contact line is responsible for the aligned deposition of
particles. The confinement distance determines the height of this thin film,
and its theoretical estimations are validated against the experimental
observations using reflection interferometry, further exhibiting good agreement
(in order of magnitude). Modulating the particle size does not significantly
influence the precipitate patterns; however, particle concentration can
substantially affect the deposition patterns. The differences in deposition
patterns are attributed to the complex interplay of the gradient of evaporation
flux induced motion of contact line in combination with the drying of thin
liquid film during dewetting.

optimality, feedback optimization controllers typically require the knowledge
of the steady-state sensitivity of the plant, which may not be easily
accessible in some applications. In contrast, in this paper we develop a
model-free feedback controller for efficient steady-state operation of general
dynamical systems. The proposed design consists in updating control inputs via
gradient estimates constructed from evaluations of the nonconvex objective at
the current input and at the measured output. We study the dynamic
interconnection of the proposed iterative controller with a stable nonlinear
discrete-time plant. For this setup, we characterize the optimality and the
stability of the closed-loop behavior as functions of the problem dimension,

Interactions, such as social and violent interactions, are generally not

interactions: Human-to-Human-or-Object (H2O). In addition, we introduce a novel
taxonomy of verbs, intended to be closer to a description of human body
attitude in relation to the surrounding targets of interaction, and more
independent of the environment. Unlike some existing datasets, we strive to
avoid defining synonymous verbs when their use highly depends on the target
type or requires a high level of semantic interpretation. As H2O dataset
includes V-COCO images annotated with this new taxonomy, images obviously
contain more interactions. This can be an issue for HOI detection methods whose
complexity depends on the number of people, targets or interactions. Thus, we
propose DIABOLO (Detecting InterActions By Only Looking Once), an efficient
subject-centric single-shot method to detect all interactions in one forward
pass, with constant inference time independent of image content. In addition,
this multi-task network simultaneously detects all people and objects. We show
how sharing a network for these tasks does not only save computation resource

preprocessing time needed to achieve polylogarithmic access time for all join

then explore its optimality by proving lower bounds for the preprocessing time

that our algorithm's bounds are tight for all lexicographic orders on join
queries. Then, we prove the hardness of Set-Disjointness based on the
Zero-Clique Conjecture which is an established conjecture from fine-grained

self-joins do not affect the complexity of direct access (up to logarithmic
factors). Our algorithm can also be used to solve queries with projections and
relaxed order requirements, though in these cases, its running time not
necessarily optimal. We also show that similar techniques to those used in our
lower bounds can be used to prove that, for enumerating answers to
Loomis-Whitney joins, it is not possible to significantly improve upon
trivially computing all answers at preprocessing. This, in turn, gives further
evidence (based on the Zero-Clique Conjecture) to the enumeration hardness of

and compare the pulse response of this model to the one of the corresponding
circuit Hamiltonian. Here we find that both models predict similar outcomes for
similar control pulses. Then, we study how different approximations affect
single-qubit (X) and two-qubit gate (Iswap and Cz) transitions in two different
two-qubit systems. For this purpose we consider three different systems in
total: a single flux-tunable transmon and two two-qubit systems. In summary, we
find that a series of commonly applied approximations (individually and/or in
combination) can change the response of a system substantially, when a control
pulse is applied.

clumps in Integrals of Motion space for nearby halo stars and evaluating their
significance robustly. Methods: We use data from Gaia EDR3 extended with radial
velocities from ground-based spectroscopic surveys to construct a sample of
halo stars within 2.5 kpc from the Sun. We apply a hierarchical clustering
method that uses the single linkage algorithm in a 3D space defined by the
commonly used integrals of motion energy $E$, together with two components of
the angular momentum, $L_z$ and $L_\perp$. To evaluate the statistical
significance of the clusters found, we compare the density within an
ellipsoidal region centered on the cluster to that of random sets with similar
global dynamical properties. We pick out the signal at the location of their
maximum statistical significance in the hierarchical tree. We estimate the
proximity of a star to the cluster center using the Mahalanobis distance. We
also apply the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm in velocity space. Results: Our
procedure identifies 67 highly significant clusters ($ > 3\sigma$), containing
12\% of the sources in our halo set, and in total 232 subgroups or individual
streams in velocity space. In total, 13.8\% of the stars in our data set can be
confidently associated to a significant cluster based on their Mahalanobis
distance. Inspection of our data set reveals a complex web of relationships
between the significant clusters, suggesting that they can be tentatively
grouped into at least 6 main structures, many of which can be associated to
previously identified halo substructures, and a number of independent
substructures. This preliminary conclusion is further explored in an

Integrals of Motion space and applied it to a large sample of nearby halo stars
with 6D phase-space information. We identified a large number of clusters, many
of which could tentatively be merged into larger groups. Our goal is to
establish the reality of the clusters through a combined study of their stellar
populations to gain more insights into the accretion history of the Milky Way.
We develop a procedure that quantifies the similarity of clusters based on KS
tests using their metallicity distribution functions, and an isochrone fitting
method to determine their average age, which is also used to compare the
distribution of stars in the Colour-Absolute magnitude diagram. This allows us
to group clusters into substructures, and to compare substructures with one
another. The clusters identified are merged into 12 extended substructures,
while 8 small clusters remain as such. The large substructures include the
previously known Gaia-Enceladus, Helmi streams, Sequoia, and Thamnos 1 and 2.
We identify overdensities associated with the hot thick disc and hosting a
metal-poor population. Especially notable is our largest substructure which,
although peaking at the metallicity characteristic of the thick disk has a well
populated metal-poor component, and dynamics in-between hot thick disc and
halo. We identify additional debris in the region occupied by Sequoia with
distinct kinematics, likely remnants of three different accretion events with
progenitors of similar mass. We also identify different trends of [Mg/Fe] vs
[Fe/H] for the various substructures confirming our dissection of the nearby
halo. At least 20\% of the halo near the Sun is associated to substructures.
When comparing their global properties, we note that those substructures on
retrograde orbits are not only more metal-poor on average but also older.

research work in the SAR field. The drawback of these opportunities is that
such images might be exposed to forgeries and manipulations by malicious users,
raising new concerns about their integrity and trustworthiness. Up to now, the
multimedia forensics literature has proposed various techniques to localize
manipulations in natural photographs, but the integrity assessment of SAR

are generated with a processing chain completely different from that of natural
photographs. This implies that many forensics methods developed for natural

of amplitude SAR imagery splicing localization. Our goal is to localize regions
of an amplitude SAR image that have been copied and pasted from another image,
possibly undergoing some kind of editing in the process. To do so, we leverage
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract a fingerprint highlighting
inconsistencies in the processing traces of the analyzed input. Then, we
examine this fingerprint to produce a binary tampering mask indicating the

tailored to the nature of SAR signals, provides better performances than

federal learning. However, the inevitable costs prevent self-interested workers
from serving for free. Moreover, due to data isolation, task publishers lack
effective methods to select, evaluate and pay reliable workers with
high-quality data. Therefore, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism
for horizontal federated learning with reputation and contribution measurement.
By designing a reasonable method of measuring contribution, we establish the
reputation of workers, which is easy to decline and difficult to improve.
Through reverse auctions, workers bid for tasks, and the task publisher selects
workers combining reputation and bid price. With the budget constraint, winning
workers are paid based on performance. We proved that our mechanism satisfies
the individual rationality of the honest worker, budget feasibility,
truthfulness, and computational efficiency.

caused by dislocation motion and the formation of slip bands; sudden
displacement discontinuities in the load-displacement response - associated
with dislocation loop nucleation - occurred at, or near the theoretical shear
strength. Furthermore, discontinuities in load-displacement curves were also
used to confirm that hysteresis loops were a result of plastic deformation, as

that the ideas developed in the U(1) case extend to other groups. These in turn
are building blocks for 1+0 matrix models, 1+1 sigma models and non-Abelian

the U(1) field, where the flavor symmetry is gauged, we can efficiently
approach the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of the quantum O(2) rotor with
increasing flavors. The emphasis of the method is on preserving the symplectic
algebra exchanging fermionic qubits by sigma matrices (or hard bosons) and
developing a formal strategy capable of generalization to SU(3) field for
lattice QCD and other non-Abelian 1+1 sigma models or 1+3 gauge theories. For

used due to its therapeutic value for PwD, as it can be used to promote
independence, positive moods and behavior, and improve their quality of life.
Caregivers are one of the main pillars in the adoption of digital technologies
for reminiscence therapy, as they are responsible for its administration.
Despite their comprehensive understanding of the needs and difficulties
associated with the therapy, their perspective has not been fully taken into
account in the development of existing technological solutions. To inform the
design of technological solutions within dementia care, we followed a
user-centered design approach through worldwide surveys, follow-up
semi-structured interviews, and focus groups. Seven hundred and seven informal
and 52 formal caregivers participated in our study. Our findings show that
technological solutions must provide mechanisms to carry out the therapy in a
simple way, reducing the amount of work for caregivers when preparing and
conducting therapy sessions. They should also diversify and personalize the
current session (and following ones) based on both the biographical information
of the PwD and their emotional reactions. This is particularly important since
the PwD often become agitated, aggressive or angry, and caregivers might not
know how to properly deal with this situation (in particular, the informal
ones). Additionally, formal caregivers need an easy way to manage information
of the different PwD they take care of, and consult the history of sessions
performed (in particular, to identify images that triggered negative emotional
reactions, and consult any notes taken about them). As a result, we present a
list of validated functional requirements gathered for the PwD and both formal

  Estimation for 3-D Video Coding",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, various view synthesis distortion estimation models have been
studied to better serve for 3-D video coding. However, they can hardly model
the relationship quantitatively among different levels of depth changes,
texture degeneration, and the view synthesis distortion (VSD), which is crucial
for rate-distortion optimization and rate allocation. In this paper, an
auto-weighted layer representation based view synthesis distortion estimation
model is developed. Firstly, the sub-VSD (S-VSD) is defined according to the
level of depth changes and their associated texture degeneration. After that, a
set of theoretical derivations demonstrate that the VSD can be approximately
decomposed into the S-VSDs multiplied by their associated weights. To obtain
the S-VSDs, a layer-based representation of S-VSD is developed, where all the
pixels with the same level of depth changes are represented with a layer to
enable efficient S-VSD calculation at the layer level. Meanwhile, a nonlinear
mapping function is learnt to accurately represent the relationship between the
VSD and S-VSDs, automatically providing weights for S-VSDs during the VSD
estimation. To learn such function, a dataset of VSD and its associated S-VSDs
are built. Experimental results show that the VSD can be accurately estimated
with the weights learnt by the nonlinear mapping function once its associated
S-VSDs are available. The proposed method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency. The dataset and
source code of the proposed method will be available at

  applications in coastal cross-shelf transport",,,"10.1017/jfm.2022.886",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We show that in free surface flows, a uniform, streamwise current over
small-amplitude wavy bottom topography generates cross-stream drift velocity.
This drift mechanism, referred to as the current-bathymetry interaction induced
drift (CBIID), is specifically understood in the context of a simplified
nearshore environment consisting of a uniform alongshore current, onshore
propagating surface waves, and monochromatic wavy bottom making an oblique
angle with the shoreline. CBIID is found to originate from the steady,
non-homogeneous solution of the governing system of equations. Similar to
Stokes drift induced by surface waves, CBIID also generates a compensating
Eulerian return flow to satisfy the no-flux lateral boundaries, e.g. the
shoreline. CBIID increases with an increase in the particle's initial depth,
bottom undulation's amplitude, and the strength of the alongshore current.
Additionally, CBIID near the free (bottom) surface increases (decreases) with
an increase in bottom undulation's wavelength. Maximum CBIID is obtained for
long wavelength bottom topography that approximately makes $\pi/4$ angle with
the shoreline. Unlike Stokes drift, particle excursions due to
current-bathymetry interactions might not be small, hence analytical
expressions based on the small-excursion approximation could be inaccurate. We
provide an alternative $z$-bounded approximation, which leads to highly
accurate expressions for drift velocity and time period of particles especially
located near the free surface. Realistic parametric analysis reveals that in
some nearshore environments, CBIID's contribution to the net Lagrangian drift
can be as important as Stokes drift, implying that CBIID can have major
implications in cross-shelf tracer transport.

which is the Hesub-Hetetra pair with a binding energy of 1.60 eV. In
considering the effect of solutes on the stability of the He-He pair, we have
proposed a unique definition of binding energy. By applying the definition, we
suggest that Ti and P could weaken He self-trapping, and Cr and C are
beneficial for He self-trapping, while Ni is similar to the matrix Fe itself.
For the diffusion of He, which is the necessary process of forming the He
bubble, we determined that the most stable interstitial He is in a tetrahedral
site and could migrate with the energy barrier of 0.16 eV in pure fcc iron. We
further found that Ti and Si can increase the barrier to 0.18 and 0.20 eV; on
the contrary, Cr and P decrease the barrier to 0.10 and 0.06 eV, respectively.
Summarizing the calculations, we conclude that Ti decreases while Cr increases

fluctuations that occur in water in the vicinity of an extended hydrophobic

surface phase transition that occurs at liquid-vapor coexistence in the
macroscopic planar limit, ie. as the solute radius $R_s\to\infty$. Focusing on
the density profile $\rho(r)$ and a sensitive spatial measure of fluctuations,
the local compressibility profile $\chi(r)$, we develop a scaling theory which
expresses the extent of the density depletion and enhancement in
compressibility in terms of $R_s$, the strength of solute-water attraction
$\varepsilon_s$, and the deviation from liquid-vapor coexistence $\delta\mu$.
Testing the predictions against results of classical density functional theory
for a simple solvent and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations of a popular
water model, we find that the theory provides a firm physical basis for
understanding how water behaves at a hydrophobe.

the object boundaries. To enforce anatomical plausibility, recent research
studies have focused on incorporating prior knowledge such as object shape or
boundary, as constraints in the loss function. Prior integrated could be
low-level referring to reformulated representations extracted from the
ground-truth segmentations, or high-level representing external medical
information such as the organ's shape or size. Over the past few years,
prior-based losses exhibited a rising interest in the research field since they
allow integration of expert knowledge while still being architecture-agnostic.
However, given the diversity of prior-based losses on different medical imaging
challenges and tasks, it has become hard to identify what loss works best for
which dataset. In this paper, we establish a benchmark of recent prior-based
losses for medical image segmentation. The main objective is to provide
intuition onto which losses to choose given a particular task or dataset. To
this end, four low-level and high-level prior-based losses are selected. The
considered losses are validated on 8 different datasets from a variety of

the WMH challenge. Results show that whereas low-level prior-based losses can
guarantee an increase in performance over the Dice loss baseline regardless of

we observe how the isothermal compressibility reaches a maximum when isolated
non-symmetric clusters are formed in an extremely dilute neutron gas. To
determine the neutron fraction, we suggest a geometrical model based on the
behavior of the proton-neutron pair correlation function. Accordingly, the
equation of state of the inner crust is calculated, illustrating that the
nuclear energy in beta-equilibrium follows a power-law behavior with baryon
density. As a possible astrophysical outcome of this study, our results could

the use of radar for ego-motion estimation. A continuous-time trajectory

optimization by being able to compute poses and their derivatives in
closed-form and at any given time along the trajectory. We compare our
continuous-time estimates to those from a discrete-time radar-inertial odometry

However, stellar activity can induce radial velocity variations that dilute or
even mimic the signature of a planet. A widely recognized method for
disentangling these signals is to model the radial velocity time series,
jointly with stellar activity indicators, using Gaussian processes and their
derivatives. However, such modeling is prohibitive in terms of computational
resources for large data sets, as the cost typically scales as the total number
of measurements cubed.
  Here, we present S+LEAF 2, a Gaussian process framework that can be used to
jointly model several time series, with a computational cost that scales

been completed in an incompressible turbulent round water jet freely spreading
into water. The jet is seeded with tracers only through the nozzle:
inhomogeneous seeding called nozzle seeding. The Lagrangian flow tagged by
these tracers therefore does not contain any contribution from particles
entrained into the jet from the quiescent surrounding fluid. The mean velocity
field of the nozzle seeded flow, $\langle \boldsymbol{U_\varphi} \rangle$, is
found to be essentially indistinguishable from the global mean velocity field
of the jet, $\langle \boldsymbol{U} \rangle$, for the axial velocity while
significant deviations are found for the radial velocity. This results in an
effective compressibility of the nozzle seeded flow for which
$\boldsymbol{\nabla \cdot} \langle \boldsymbol{U_\varphi} \rangle \neq 0$ even
though the global background flow is fully incompressible. By using mass
conservation and self-similarity, we quantitatively explain the modified radial
velocity profile and analytically express the missing contribution associated
to entrained fluid particles. By considering a classical advection-diffusion
description, we explicitly connect turbulent diffusion of mass (through the
turbulent diffusivity $K_T$) and momentum (through the turbulent viscosity
$\nu_T$) to entrainment. This results in new practical relations to
experimentally determine the non-uniform spatial profiles of $K_T$ and $\nu_T$
(and hence of the turbulent Prandtl number $\sigma_T = \nu_T/K_T$) from simple
measurements of the mean tracer concentration and axial velocity profiles.
Overall, the proposed approach based on nozzle seeded flow gives new
experimental and theoretical elements for a better comprehension of turbulent
diffusion and entrainment in turbulent jets.

Standard high-fidelity forward solvers solve wave equations with natural
spatial parametrizations based on fine discretization. Similar
parametrizations, typically involving tens of thousand of variables, are
usually employed to parameterize the subsurface in tomography applications.
When the data do not allow to resolve details at such finely parameterized
scales, it is often beneficial to instead rely on a prior-knowledge-based
parametrization defined on a lower dimension domain (or manifold). Due to the
increased identifiability in the reduced domain, the concomitant inversion is
better constrained and generally faster. We illustrate the potential of a
prior-knowledge-based approach by considering ground penetrating radar (GPR)
travel-time tomography in a crosshole configuration. An effective
parametrization of the input (i.e., the permittivity distributions) and
compression in the output (i.e., the travel-time gathers) spaces are achieved
via data-driven principal component decomposition based on random realizations
of the prior Gaussian-process model with a truncation determined by the
performances of the standard solver on the full and reduced model domains. To
accelerate the inversion process, we employ a high-fidelity polynomial chaos
expansion (PCE) surrogate model. We show that a few hundreds design data sets
is sufficient to provide reliable Markov chain Monte Carlo inversion.
Appropriate uncertainty quantification is achieved by reintroducing the
truncated higher-order principle components in the original model space after
inversion on the manifold and by adapting a likelihood function that accounts
for the fact that the truncated higher-order components are not completely
located in the null-space.

However, without any guidance at the pixel level, such methods may yield
inaccurate regions. This problem is known to be more challenging with histology
images than with natural ones, since objects are less salient, structures have
more variations, and foreground and background regions have stronger
similarities. Therefore, computer vision methods for visual interpretation of
CNNs may not directly apply. In this paper, a simple yet efficient method based
on a composite loss is proposed to learn information from the fully negative
samples (i.e., samples without positive regions), and thereby reduce false
positives/negatives. Our new loss function contains two complementary terms:
the first exploits positive evidence collected from the CNN classifier, while
the second leverages the fully negative samples from training data. In
particular, a pre-trained CNN is equipped with a decoder that allows refining
the regions of interest. The CNN is exploited to collect both positive and
negative evidence at the pixel level to train the decoder. Our method called
NEGEV benefits from the fully negative samples that naturally occur in the
data, without any additional supervision signals beyond image-class labels.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantial outperform
related state-of-art methods on GlaS (public benchmark for colon cancer), and
Camelyon16 (patch-based benchmark for breast cancer using three different

of ambient structures in BL Lac objects through the analysis of their gamma-ray
spectrum. Gamma rays, passing through structures at different distances from
the black hole, interact via $\gamma\gamma$ pair production with the
corresponding photon fields and produce absorption features in their spectral
energy distribution. An interaction with a putative broad-line region may
reduce the gamma-ray flux only if its production site were very close to the
central engine. However, if jet photons interact with a bath of optical-UV seed
photons produced by a narrow-line region extended over the parsec scale, the
consequent $\gamma\gamma$ process may cause absorption features detectable at a
few hundreds GeV. The detection of such absorption features is facilitated in
sources with spectra reaching TeV energies, and specifically HBLs and EHBLs
(extreme blazars) may represent exceptional probes to investigate this topic.

Some binary stars observed by Kepler indicate the presence of r~modes that are

rotation periods in 20 eccentric (heartbeat) binaries with r-mode signatures.
The majority of the rotation periods are found to be comparable to
pseudo-synchronous periods, in which the angular velocity of rotation is
similar to the angular orbital motion of the companion at periastron. In
particular, for the heartbeat stars with orbital periods longer than about
8\,d, all but one agree with pseudo-synchronous rotation. In contrast to a

""information transfer"" from a source to a target signal by ignoring
self-predictability of a target signal when quantifying the source-target
relationship. A simple example for signals with such self-predictability are
narrowband signals. These are both thought to be intrinsically generated by the
brain as well as commonly dealt with in analyses of brain signals, where
band-pass filters are used to separate responses from noise. However, the use
of Transfer Entropy is usually discouraged in such cases. We simulate
simplistic examples where we confirm the failure of classic implementations of
Transfer Entropy when applied to narrow-band signals, as made evident by a
flawed recovery of effect sizes and interaction delays. We propose an
alternative approach based on a whitening of the input signals before computing
a bivariate measure of directional time-lagged dependency. This approach solves
the problems found in the simple simulated systems. Finally, we explore the
behaviour of our measure when applied to delta and theta response components in
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses to continuous speech. The small effects
that our measure attributes to a directed interaction from the stimulus to the
neuronal responses are stronger in the theta than in the delta band. This
suggests that the delta band reflects a more predictive coupling, while the
theta band is stronger involved in bottom-up, reactive processing. Taken
together, we hope to increase the interest in directed perspectives on
frequency-specific dependencies.

and deletions. These problems are motivated by several applications, among them
is reconstructing strands in DNA-based storage systems. Under this paradigm, a
word is transmitted over some fixed number of identical independent channels
and the goal of the decoder is to output the transmitted word or some close
approximation of it. The first part of this paper studies the deletion channel
that deletes a symbol with some fixed probability $p$, while focusing on two
instances of this channel. Since operating the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder
in this case is computationally unfeasible, we study a slightly degraded
version of this decoder for two channels and its expected normalized distance.
We identify the dominant error patterns and based on these observations, it is
derived that the expected normalized distance of the degraded ML decoder is
roughly $\frac{3q-1}{q-1}p^2$, when the transmitted word is any $q$-ary
sequence and $p$ is the channel's deletion probability. We also study the cases
when the transmitted word belongs to the Varshamov Tenengolts (VT) code or the
shifted VT code. Additionally, the insertion channel is studied as well as the
case of two insertion channels. These theoretical results are verified by
corresponding simulations. The second part of the paper studies optimal
decoding for a special case of the deletion channel, the $k$-deletion channel,
which deletes exactly $k$ symbols of the transmitted word uniformly at random.
In this part, the goal is to understand how an optimal decoder operates in
order to minimize the expected normalized distance. A full characterization of
an efficient optimal decoder for this setup, referred to as the maximum
likelihood* (ML*) decoder, is given for a channel that deletes one or two
symbols.

analytically that the molecular dissociation occurring in a Heyrovsky reaction
can be interpreted as a Quantum Dynamical Phase Transition, i.e., an analytical
discontinuity in the molecular energy spectrum induced by the catalyst. The
metallic substrate plays the role of an environment that produces an energy
uncertainty on the adatom. This broadening induces a critical behavior not
possible in a quantum closed system. We use suitable approximations on
symmetry, together with both Lanczos and canonical transformations, to give
analytical estimates for the critical parameters of molecular dissociation.
This occurs when the bonding to the surface is (\sqrt{2}) times the molecular
bonding. This value is slightly weakened for less symmetric situations. However
simple, this conclusion involves a high order perturbative solution of the
molecule-catalyst system. This model is further simplified to discuss how an
environment-induced critical phenomenon can be evaluated through an idealized
perturbative tunneling microscopy set-up. In this case, the energy
uncertainties in one or both atoms are either Lorentzian or Gaussian. The
former results from the Fermi Golden Rule, i.e., a Markovian approximation. The
Gaussian uncertainty, associated with non-Markovian decoherent processes,
requires the introduction of a particular model of a spin bath. The partially
coherent tunneling current is obtained from the Generalized Landauer-B\""uttiker
Equations. The resonances observed in these transport parameters reflect, in
many cases, the critical properties of the resonances in the molecular
spectrum.

Quantum illumination is an example of this, based on signal-idler entanglement,
promising a potential 6 dB advantage in error exponent over its optimal
classical counterpart. So far, receiver designs achieving this optimal
reception remain elusive with many proposals based on Gaussian processes
appearing unable to utilise quantum information contained within Gaussian state

the detection stage of a quantum illumination-based quantum target detection
protocol. Such a non-Gaussian amplifier offers a means of probabilistically
amplifying an incoming signal without the addition of noise. Considering
symmetric hypothesis testing, the quantum Chernoff bound is derived and limits
on detection error probability is analysed for both the two-mode squeezed
vacuum state and the coherent state classical benchmark. Our findings show that
in such a scheme the potential quantum advantage is amplified even in regimes
where quantum illumination alone offers no advantage, thereby extending its
potential use. The same cannot be said for coherent states, whose performances

detected signal photons per pixel. However, the existing computational methods
for photon-efficient imaging are pre-tuned on a restricted scenario or trained
on simulated datasets. When applied to realistic scenarios whose
signal-to-background ratios (SBR) and other hardware-specific properties differ
from those of the original task, the model performance often significantly
deteriorates. In this paper, we present a domain adversarial adaptation design
to alleviate this domain shift problem by exploiting unlabeled real-world data,
with significant resource savings. This method demonstrates superior
performance on simulated and real-world experiments using our home-built
up-conversion single-photon imaging system, which provides an efficient
approach to bypass the lack of ground-truth depth information in implementing
computational imaging algorithms for realistic applications.

creating an adaptive steganographic system. Most modern deep-learning models
are regarded as deterministic because they only offer predictions while failing
to provide uncertainty measurement. Bayesian neural networks bring a
probabilistic perspective to deep learning and can be regarded as self-aware
intelligent machinery; that is, a machine that knows its own limitations. To
quantify uncertainty, we apply Bayesian statistics to model the predictive
distribution and approximate it through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic
forward passes. We further show that predictive uncertainty can be disentangled
into aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and these quantities can be learnt
unsupervised. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement delivered by
Bayesian uncertainty analysis upon steganographic rate-distortion performance.

attention. Some problems for deep learning approaches to sound synthesis relate
to the amount of data needed to specify an audio signal and the necessity of
preserving both the long and short time coherence of the synthesised signal.
Visual time-frequency representations such as the log-mel-spectrogram have
gained in popularity. The log-mel-spectrogram is a perceptually informed
representation of audio that greatly compresses the amount of information
required for the description of the sound. However, because of this
compression, this representation is not directly invertible. Both signal
processing and machine learning techniques have previously been applied to the
inversion of the log-mel-spectrogram but they both caused audible distortions
in the synthesized sounds due to issues of temporal and spectral coherence. In
this paper, we outline the application of a sinusoidal model to the inversion

state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The approach could be later used as a
general decoding step from spectral to time intervals in neural applications.

velocity maps of 1862 galaxies taken from the MaNGA survey (SDSS public Data
Release 15). We use a random forest classifier to identify the kinematic
parameters that are most connected to galaxy quenching. We find that kinematic
parameters that relate predominantly to the disc (such as the mean rotational
velocity) and parameters that characterise whether a galaxy is rotation- or
dispersion-dominated (such as the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity
dispersion) are not fundamentally linked to the quenching of star formation.
Instead, we find overwhelmingly that it is the absolute level of velocity
dispersion (a property that relates primarily to a galaxy's bulge/spheroidal
component) that is most important for separating star forming and quenched
galaxies. Furthermore, a partial correlation analysis shows that many commonly
discussed correlations between galaxy properties and quenching are spurious,
and that the fundamental correlation is between quenching and velocity
dispersion. In particular, we find that at fixed velocity dispersion, there is
only a very weak dependence of quenching on the disc properties, whereby more
discy galaxies are slightly more likely to be forming stars. By invoking the
tight relationship between black hole mass and velocity dispersion, and noting
that black hole mass traces the total energy released by AGN, we argue that
these data support a scenario in which quenching occurs by preventive feedback
from AGN. The kinematic measurements from this work are publicly available.

help determine how experiments are implemented in practice. It is common to
specify a desired level of power and compute the sample size necessary to

designs. For example, it has recently been established that rerandomization,
where subjects are randomized until covariate balance is obtained, increases
the precision of causal effect estimators. This work establishes the power of
rerandomized treatment-control experiments, thereby allowing for sample size
calculators. We find the surprising result that, while power is often greater
under rerandomization than complete randomization, the opposite can occur for
very small treatment effects. The reason is that inference under
rerandomization can be relatively more conservative, in the sense that it can
have a lower type-I error at the same nominal significance level, and this
additional conservativeness adversely affects power. This surprising result is
due to treatment effect heterogeneity, a quantity often ignored in power
analyses. We find that heterogeneity increases power for large effect sizes but
decreases power for small effect sizes.

extensive this phenomenon is, we analyze two other transformations of two iid
centered normal random vectors. These transformations are similar in spirit to
the transformation considered by Pillai and Meng (2016). One transformation
involves absolute values: $\sum_{j=1}^n w_j X_j/|Y_j|$. The second involves
randomly stopped Brownian motions: $\sum_{j=1}^n w_j X_j\bigl(Y_j^{-2}\bigr)$,
where $\bigl\{\bigl( X_1(t),\ldots, X_n(t)\bigr), \, t\geq 0\bigr\},\ n>1,$ is
a Brownian motion with positive variances; $(Y_1,\ldots, Y_n)$ is a centered
normal random vector with the same law as $( X_1(1),\ldots, X_n(1))$ and
independent of it; and $X(Y^{-2})$ is the value of the Brownian motion $X(t)$
evaluated at the random time $t=Y^{-2}$. All three transformations result in a
Cauchy distribution if the covariance matrix of the normal components is
diagonal, or if all the correlations implied by the covariance matrix equal 1.
However, while the transformation Pillai and Meng (2016) considered produces a
Cauchy distribution regardless of the normal covariance matrix. the
transformations we consider here do not always produce a Cauchy distribution.
The correlations between jointly normal random variables are not always
overwhelmed by the heaviness of the marginal tails. The mysteries of the
connections between normal and Cauchy laws remain to be understood.

formed with two guided modes at frequencies detuned from the atomic transition.
We show that cold Rubidium atoms can be trapped as close as 100 nm from the
structure in a 1.3-mK-deep potential well. For atoms trapped at this position,
the emission into guided photons is largely favored, with a beta factor as high
as 0.88 and a radiative decay rate into the slow mode 10 times larger than the
free-space decay rate.

high school education. In our experiment we focused on the possibilities of the
apparatus to measure the time difference 'deltatime (DT)' between signals in
two scintillation detectors and the signal amplitude 'pulse height (PH)' of the
signal in one detector. We performed measurements in two arrangements: first
vertical, detectors parallel and above each other, second horizontal, detectors
parallel and next to each other. We observed that in both the vertical and
horizontal arrangements, low-amplitude signals from cosmic rays in the two
detectors showed unexpected coincidences. Under normal experimental conditions
these effects were not observed because the amplification in the
photomultiplier (PMT) as well as the threshold voltage were intentionally
chosen to avoid noise and excessively high count rates. The rate at which the
coincidences occur is very small, more than a thousand times smaller than the
count rates of the individual detectors. However, the measurement of the
deltatime spectrum appears to be a sensitive way to detect the presence of
these rare and unexpected effects. The time differences between the signals at
the two analyzer inputs were measured with a resolution of 0.5 ns and the pulse
height measurement had a resolution of approximately 8 mV. It is estimated that
the low-amplitude signals involved in the coincidences must respond to energy
absorptions of the order of 100 keV in the scintillator material.

quantized vortices when exposed to out-of-plane magnetic fields. In presence of
a supercurrent, a Lorentz-like force acts on the vortices, leading to drift and
dissipation. The current-induced vortex motion is impeded by pinning at
defects, enabling the use of superconductors to generate high magnetic fields
without dissipation. Usually, the pinning strength decreases upon any type of
pair-breaking. Here we show that in Rashba superconductors the application of
an in-plane field leads, instead, to an unexpected enhancement of pinning. When
rotating the in-plane component of the field with respect to the current
direction, the vortex inductance turns out to be highly anisotropic. We explain
this phenomenon as a manifestation of Lifshitz invariant terms in the
Ginzburg-Landau free energy, which are enabled by inversion and time-reversal
symmetry breaking and lead to an elliptic squeezing of vortex cores. Our
experiment provides access to a fundamental property of Rashba superconductors

that had an immense impact on the data compression, substituting arithmetic and
Huffman coding. The optimality of ANS was studied by Duda et al. but the
precise asymptotic behaviour of its redundancy (in comparison to the entropy)
was not completely understood. In this paper we establish an optimal bound on
the redundancy for the tabled ANS (tANS), the most popular ANS variant. Given a
sequence $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ of letters from an alphabet $\{0,\ldots,\sigma-1\}$
such that each letter $a$ occurs in it $f_a$ times and $n=2^r$, the tANS
encoder using Duda's ``precise initialization'' to fill tANS tables transforms
this sequence into a bit string of length (frequencies are not included in the
encoding size): $$ \sum\limits_{a\in
[0..\sigma)}f_a\cdot\log\frac{n}{f_a}+O(\sigma+r), $$ where $O(\sigma + r)$ can
be bounded by $\sigma\log e+r$. The $r$-bit term is an encoder artifact
indispensable to ANS; the rest incurs a redundancy of $O(\frac{\sigma}{n})$
bits per letter. We complement this bound by a series of examples showing that
an $\Omega(\sigma+r)$ redundancy is necessary when $\sigma > n/3$, where
$\Omega(\sigma + r)$ is at least $\frac{\sigma-1}{4}+r-2$. We argue that
similar examples exist for any methods that distribute letters in tANS tables
using only the knowledge about frequencies. Thus, we refute Duda's conjecture
that the redundancy is $O(\frac{\sigma}{n^2})$ bits per letter.
  We also propose a new variant of range ANS (rANS), called rANS with fixed
accuracy, that is parameterized by $k \ge 1$. In this variant the integer
division, which is unavoidable in rANS, is performed only in cases when its
result belongs to $[2^k..2^{k+1})$. Hence, the division can be computed by
faster methods provided $k$ is small. We bound the redundancy for the rANS with
fixed accuracy $k$ by $\frac{n}{2^k-1}\log e+r$.

processing (NLP) application for answering patient-specific questions by
locating answers in their clinical notes. Realistic clinical EQA can have
multiple answers to a single question and multiple focus points in one
question, which are lacking in the existing datasets for development of
artificial intelligence solutions. Objective: Create a dataset for developing
and evaluating clinical EQA systems that can handle natural multi-answer and

2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) corpus to generate an EQA dataset.
Specifically, the 1-to-N, M-to-1, and M-to-N drug-reason relations were
included to form the multi-answer and multi-focus QA entries, which represent
more complex and natural challenges in addition to the basic
one-drug-one-reason cases. A baseline solution was developed and tested on the

the answerable questions, 25% require multiple answers, and 2% ask about
multiple drugs within one question. There are frequent cues observed around the
answers in the text, and 90% of the drug and reason terms occur within the same
or an adjacent sentence. The baseline EQA solution achieved a best f1-measure
of 0.72 on the entire dataset, and on specific subsets, it was: 0.93 on the
unanswerable questions, 0.48 on single-drug questions versus 0.60 on multi-drug
questions, 0.54 on the single-answer questions versus 0.43 on multi-answer

systems that need to handle multi-answer and multi-focus questions.

high-performance binary hologram optimization framework to minimize the binary

for 2D as well as 3D cases. Utilizing the fast operation of binary modulation,
the full-color high-framerate holographic video projection is realized while
the speckle noise of random phase is overcome by temporal multiplexing. Our
high-quality true 3D holography is experimentally verified by projecting
multiple arbitrary dense images simultaneously. The proposed method can be
adopted in various applications of holography, where we show additional

penultimate with a well-tuned compact one. Unlike previous layer-wise

static networks, consequently overlooking the longitudinal behavior of a
reviewer thus the dynamics of co-review relations among reviewers in a group.
Hence, these approaches are incapable of excluding outlier reviewers, which are
fraudsters intentionally camouflaging themselves in a group and genuine
reviewers happen to co-review in fraudster groups. To address this issue, in
this work, we propose to first capitalize on the effectiveness of the HIN-RNN
in both reviewers' representation learning while capturing the collaboration
between reviewers, we first utilize the HIN-RNN to model the co-review
relations of reviewers in a group in a fixed time window of 28 days. We refer
to this as spatial relation learning representation to signify the
generalisability of this work to other networked scenarios. Then we use an RNN
on the spatial relations to predict the spatio-temporal relations of reviewers
in the group. In the third step, a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) refines the
reviewers' vector representations using these predicted relations. These
refined representations are then used to remove outlier reviewers. The average
of the remaining reviewers' representation is then fed to a simple fully
connected layer to predict if the group is a fraudster group or not. Exhaustive

  treatment and application to irradiated graphite","Discussion clarified, results unchanged",,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Graphite-moderated nuclear reactors have already produced more than 250000
tons of irradiated nuclear graphite, or i-graphite, world-wide. The
sustainability of this technology relies on the end-of-life management of its
moderator, which is activated into a long-lived nuclear waste, by neutron
fluxes, during operating time. In particular, C14 is created. Nuclear
transmutation, enabled by laser-driven particle acceleration, has been
envisioned as a potential novel treatment scheme for long-lived nuclear waste.
By triggering controlled nuclear reactions with energetic particles, long-lived
radionuclides could be transformed into stable isotopes. Such a system could
treat the C14 nuclei trapped within the i-graphite matrix, which is difficult
to isolate by other means. This work performs a quantitative preliminary study
of this transmutation scheme, in order to assess its feasibility at an
industrial scale. The method used can be transposed to assess any transmutation
scheme using a beam of particles directly sent on the material to be treated.
First, a nuclear interaction channel which transmutes C14 nuclei without
creating new long-lived radionuclides is identified. It consists in the choice
of a type of particle, among which protons, gamma photons and neutrons can all
be accelerated by laser-matter interaction; and it is completed by the adequate
energy at which this particle must be sent on i-graphite. To that end, the
nuclear cross-sections of C12, C13 and C14 are reviewed, neglecting other
impurities in i-graphite. Then, based on the interaction channel
identification, the energy cost of this scheme is estimated. Protons between 1
and 5 MeV make it possible to transmute C14 without creating any new long-lived
activity. However, our result show that, even in this favorable reaction
channel, the transmutation energy cost is too high for an i-graphite
transmutation scheme to be feasible.

while retrospecting a given situation, think about questions such as ""What was
the cause of the given situation?"", ""What would be the effect of my action?"",
or ""Which action led to this effect?"". It develops a causal model of the world,
which learns with fewer data points, makes inferences, and contemplates
counterfactual scenarios. The unseen, unknown, scenarios are known as
counterfactuals. AI algorithms use a representation based on knowledge graphs
(KG) to represent the concepts of time, space, and facts. A KG is a graphical
data model which captures the semantic relationships between entities such as
events, objects, or concepts. The existing KGs represent causal relationships
extracted from texts based on linguistic patterns of noun phrases for causes
and effects as in ConceptNet and WordNet. The current causality representation
in KGs makes it challenging to support counterfactual reasoning. A richer
representation of causality in AI systems using a KG-based approach is needed
for better explainability, and support for intervention and counterfactuals
reasoning, leading to improved understanding of AI systems by humans. The
causality representation requires a higher representation framework to define
the context, the causal information, and the causal effects. The proposed
Causal Knowledge Graph (CausalKG) framework, leverages recent progress of
causality and KG towards explainability. CausalKG intends to address the lack
of a domain adaptable causal model and represent the complex causal relations
using the hyper-relational graph representation in the KG. We show that the
CausalKG's interventional and counterfactual reasoning can be used by the AI

far, to the best of our knowledge, no known method focusing on accelerating

acceleration technique to reduce the scale of computation in rule induction. We
propose an accelerator for rule induction based on fuzzy rough theory; the
accelerator can avoid redundant computation and accelerate the building of a
rule classifier. First, a rule induction method based on consistence degree,
called Consistence-based Value Reduction (CVR), is proposed and used as basis
to accelerate. Second, we introduce a compacted search space termed Key Set,
which only contains the key instances required to update the induced rule, to
conduct value reduction. The monotonicity of Key Set ensures the feasibility of
our accelerator. Third, a rule-induction accelerator is designed based on Key
Set, and it is theoretically guaranteed to display the same results as the
unaccelerated version. Specifically, the rank preservation property of Key Set
ensures consistency between the rule induction achieved by the accelerator and
the unaccelerated method. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed accelerator can perform remarkably faster than the unaccelerated

operations, infrastructure maintenance etc., a key control design challenge
arises when the quadrotor has to manoeuvre through constrained spaces during
various operational scenarios: for example, inspecting a pipeline within
predefined velocity and space, dropping relief material at a precise location
under tight spaces etc., under the face of parametric uncertainties and
external disturbances. To tackle such scenarios, a controller needs to ensure a
predefined tracking accuracy so as not to violate the constraints while
simultaneously tackling uncertainties and disturbances. However,
state-of-the-art controllers dealing with constrained system motion are either
not applicable for an underactuated system like quadrotor, or cannot tackle
system uncertainties under full state constraints. This work attempts to fill
such a gap in literature by designing Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) based
robust controllers to satisfy multiple state-constraints while simultaneously
negotiating parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. The superiority
of the BLF control method over a typical unconstrained controller is
demonstrated, followed by a robust control design to satisfy position and
orientation constraints on quadrotor dynamics. Finally, full state-constraints
on a quadrotor(i.e., constraints on the position, orientation, linear velocity
and angular velocity) are satisfied with robust control. For each control
design, the closed-loop system stability is studied analytically and the
efficacy of the design is validated extensively either via realistic simulation
scenarios or via experiments performed on a real quadrotor.

follow the nonlinear development of the MRI in eccentric disks. We find that
the MRI in eccentric disks resembles circular disks in two ways, in the overall
level of saturation and in the dependence of the detailed saturated state on
magnetic topology. However, in contrast with circular disks, the Maxwell stress
in eccentric disks can be negative in some disk sectors, even though the
integrated stress is always positive. The angular momentum flux raises the
eccentricity of the inner parts of the disk and diminishes the same of the
outer parts. Because material accreting onto a black hole from an eccentric
orbit possesses more energy than material tracing the innermost stable circular
orbit, the radiative efficiency of eccentric disks may be significantly lower
than circular disks. This may resolve the ""inverse energy problem"" seen in many

forecast up to twenty weeks using high-volume, high-velocity data on home
showings, listing events, and historic sales data. We demonstrate our analysis
using data from seven million individual records sourced from a unique,
proprietary dataset that has not previously been explored in application to the
real estate market. We then employ a series of predictive models to estimate
current and forecast future housing demand. A housing demand index provides
insight into the level of demand for a home on the market and to what extent
current demand represents future expectation. As a result, these indices
provide decision-making support into important questions about when to sell or
buy, or the elasticity present in the housing demand market, which impact price
negotiations, price-taking and price-setting expectations. This forecast is
especially valuable because it helps buyers and sellers to know on a granular
and timely basis if they should engage in a home transaction or adjust their
home price both in current and future states based on our forecasted housing
demand index.

proposes to establish a scientific method for the systematic classification of

four phases: the redrawing of cases with a precise replicable technique; the
choice of indicators; the measurement of urban development; the classification
of cases. The method is applied to cases that are comparable with each other in
terms of type of event and period: we have chosen post-World War II
reconstructions in Europe given the larger availability of documentation. The
paper leads both to the consolidation of the model as effective and replicable
and to the construction of the application, which revises the qualitative

products, monolithic materials still require special attention during their
processing steps as various phase transformations may take place during the

critical process observed during the first heating cycle of refractory linings,
as the enhanced particle packing and reduced permeability of the resulting
microstructure may lead to recurrent explosive spalling and mechanical damage
associated with dewatering and the development of high steam pressure at the
inner regions of such dense materials. In this context, this review article
mainly addresses (i) the theoretical aspects related to the drying process of
dense refractories, (ii) the influence of the phase transformations derived
from the binder additives, and (iii) the usual and advanced experimental
techniques to assess the water removal from consolidated castable pieces. Many
studies have pointed out that due to the complex nature of this phenomenon
(i.e., considering combined thermal stresses and pore pressure, heterogeneous
microstructure, evolving pore structure with temperature, etc.), the mechanisms
behind the water withdrawal and castables explosive spalling are lacking
further understanding and, consequently, it has been difficult to save time and
energy during the first heating of industrial equipment lined with ceramic
materials. On the other hand, different methods are used for refractory
spalling assessment and many efforts have been carried out in applying in situ
imaging techniques (such as NMR and neutron tomography) to follow the moisture

graphs. Recent advances in parallelization allow for estimates of total
sub-graphs counts in very large graphs. The task of counting the frequency of
each sub-graph associated with each vertex also received excellent solutions
for undirected graphs. However, there is currently no good solution for very
large directed graphs.
  We here propose VDMC (Vertex specific Distributed Motif Counting) -- a fully
distributed algorithm to optimally count all the 3 and 4 vertices connected
directed graphs (sub-graph motifs) associated with each vertex of a graph. VDMC
counts each motif only once and its efficacy is linear in the number of counted
motifs. It is fully parallelized to be efficient in GPU-based computation. VDMC
is based on three main elements: 1) Ordering the vertices and only counting
motifs containing increasing order vertices, 2) sub-ordering motifs based on
the average length of the BFS composing the motif, and 3) removing isomorphisms
only once for the entire graph. We here compare VDMC to analytical estimates of
the expected number of motifs and show its accuracy. VDMC is available as a
highly efficient CPU and GPU code with a novel data structure for efficient
graph manipulation. We show the efficacy of VDMC and real-world graphs. VDMC
allows for the precise analysis of sub-graph frequency around each vertex in
large graphs and opens the way for the extension of methods until now limited

extensive and wide-ranging, there have been very few attempts to quantify and
measure localised financial exclusion anywhere in the world. This is a subject
of growing importance in modern UK society with the withdrawal of cash
infrastructure and a shift towards online banking. This research develops a
composite indicator using a wide-range of input variables, including the
locations of existing cash infrastructure, various demographic factors (such as
income and housing tenure) and other freely available lifestyle data to
identify areas at greatest risk of financial exclusion, thereby aiding
organisations to develop intervention strategies to tackle the problem. The
indicator illustrates that whilst there is no apparent correlation between
financial exclusion and deprivation, pockets of extreme financial exclusion are
generally found in deprived communities, and affluent, suburban areas tend to
score consistently more favourably and consequently carry less risk. The
attributing causes vary, from a lack of infrastructure, to low car
availability, but income levels have a pronounced influence. Three policy
proposals are put forward, including offering banking services at PayPoint
outlets, and converting cash machines to cash recyclers, but improving digital
adoption was found to be the most effective intervention, provided that it is
implemented by community organisations. Policies purely targeting
infrastructure provision or addressing social exclusion are unlikely to be
effective, as community-based initiatives coupled with wider reforms to the
