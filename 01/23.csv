  Mask Occlusion",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The face mask is an essential sanitaryware in daily lives growing during the
pandemic period and is a big threat to current face recognition systems. The
masks destroy a lot of details in a large area of face, and it makes it
difficult to recognize them even for humans. The evaluation report shows the
difficulty well when recognizing masked faces. Rapid development and
breakthrough of deep learning in the recent past have witnessed most promising
results from face recognition algorithms. But they fail to perform far from
satisfactory levels in the unconstrained environment during the challenges such
as varying lighting conditions, low resolution, facial expressions, pose
variation and occlusions. Facial occlusions are considered one of the most
intractable problems. Especially when the occlusion occupies a large region of
the face because it destroys lots of official features.

  Performance","Accepted by IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications Special
  Issue on Integrated Sensing and Communication",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as a promising technology to
reconfigure the radio propagation environment by dynamically controlling
wireless signal's amplitude and/or phase via a large number of reflecting
elements. In contrast to the vast literature on studying IRS's performance
gains in wireless communications, we study in this paper a new application of
IRS for sensing/localizing targets in wireless networks. Specifically, we
propose a new self-sensing IRS architecture where the IRS controller is capable
of transmitting probing signals that are not only directly reflected by the
target (referred to as the direct echo link), but also consecutively reflected
by the IRS and then the target (referred to as the IRS-reflected echo link).
Moreover, dedicated sensors are installed at the IRS for receiving both the
direct and IRS-reflected echo signals from the target, such that the IRS can
sense the direction of its nearby target by applying a customized multiple
signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. However, since the angle estimation
mean square error (MSE) by the MUSIC algorithm is intractable, we propose to
optimize the IRS passive reflection for maximizing the average echo signals'
total power at the IRS sensors and derive the resultant Cramer-Rao bound (CRB)
of the angle estimation MSE. Last, numerical results are presented to show the
effectiveness of the proposed new IRS sensing architecture and algorithm, as
compared to other benchmark sensing systems/algorithms.

to enhance the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, but its
application relies on the use of high-frequency microwave to manipulate
electron spins, an increasingly demanding task as the applied magnetic field
grows. Here we investigate the dynamics of a system hosting a polarizing agent
formed by two distinct paramagnetic centers near a level anti-crossing. We
theoretically show that nuclear spins polarize efficiently under a cyclic
protocol that combines alternating thermal jumps and radio-frequency pulses
connecting hybrid states with opposite nuclear and electronic spin alignment.
Central to this process is the difference between the spin-lattice relaxation
times of either electron spin species, transiently driving the electronic spin
bath out of equilibrium after each thermal jump. Without the need for microwave
excitation, this route to enhanced nuclear polarization may prove convenient,
particularly if the polarizing agent is designed to feature electronic level
anti-crossings at high magnetic fields.

to be arc-disjoint if $A(D_1)\cap A(D_2)=\emptyset$. Let $\lambda_S(D)$ be the
maximum number of arc-disjoint $S$-strong subgraphs in $D$. The strong subgraph
$k$-arc-connectivity is defined as $$\lambda_k(D)=\min\{\lambda_S(D)\mid

generalization of classical edge-connectivity of undirected graphs.
  In this paper, we first obtain a formula for the arc-connectivity of
Cartesian product $\lambda(G\Box H)$ of two digraphs $G$ and $H$ generalizing a
formula for edge-connectivity of Cartesian product of two undirected graphs
obtained by Xu and Yang (2006). Then we study the strong subgraph

superoutburst. Our observations cover this superoutburst from around the
optical peak of the outburst to the post-superoutburst stage. During the early
superhump phase, the emission lines of Balmer series, He I, He II, Bowen blend,
and C IV / N IV blend were detected. He II 4686 line exhibited a double-peaked
emission profile, where Balmer emission lines were single-peaked, which is
unexpected from its high inclination. In the ordinary superhump phase, Balmer
series transitioned to double-peaked emission profiles, and high-ionization
lines were significantly weakened. These transitions of the line profiles
should be related to the structural transformation of the accretion disk, as
expected between the early and ordinary superhump transition in the
thermal-tidal instability model. The Doppler map of H$\alpha$ during the early
superhump phase exhibits a compact blob centered at the primary white dwarf. In
analogy to SW Sex-type cataclysmic variables, this feature could emerge from
the disk wind and/or the mass accretion column onto the magnetized white dwarf.
The Doppler map of He II 4686 \AA~ is dominated by the ring-like structure and
imposed two flaring regions with the velocity of $\sim$300 km/s, which is too
slow for a Keplerian accretion disk. The phase of the flaring regions was
coincident with the inner spiral arm structure identified during the early
superhump phase. Our disk wind model with the enhanced emission from the inner
arm structure successfully reproduced the observed properties of He II 4686
\AA. Therefore, V455 And is the first case in dwarf nova outbursts that the
presence of the disk wind is inferred from an optical spectrum.

active star-forming regions in our Galaxy and it contains several large young
star clusters. The distances of the individual clusters and their physical
connection were poorly known up to now, with strongly discrepant results
reported in the literature. Aims: We want to determine reliable distances of
the young stellar clusters in the central Carina Nebula region (in particular,
Tr 14, 15, and 16) and the prominent clusters NGC 3324 and NGC 3293 in the
northwestern periphery of the CNC. Methods: We analyzed the parallaxes in Gaia
EDR3 for a comprehensive sample of 237 spectroscopically identified OB stars,
as well as for 9562 X-ray-selected young stars throughout the complex. We also
performed an astrometric analysis to identify members of the young cluster vdBH
99, which is located in the foreground of the northwestern part of the Carina
Nebula. Results: We find that the distances of the investigated clusters in the
CNC are equal within <= 2%, and yield very consistent most likely mean distance
values of 2.36(+0.05 -0.05) kpc for the OB star sample and 2.34(+0.05 -0.06)

that the clusters in the CNC constitute a coherent star-forming region, in
particular with regard to NGC 3324 and NGC 3293 at the northwestern periphery,
which are (within <= 2%) at the same distance as the central Carina Nebula. For
the foreground cluster vdBH 99, we find a mean distance of 441(+2 -2) pc and an
age of ~ 60 Myr. We quantified the contamination of X-ray-selected samples of
Carina Nebula stars based on members of this foreground cluster.

reaction known as neutrinoless double beta decay ($\beta\beta 0\nu$) can occur,
with a characteristic lifetime which is expected to be very long, making the
suppression of backgrounds a daunting task. It has been shown that detecting
(``tagging'') the Ba$^{+2}$ dication produced in the double beta decay
${}^{136}\mathrm{Xe} \rightarrow {}^{136}$Ba$^{+2}+ 2 e + (2 \nu)$ in a high
pressure gas experiment, could lead to a virtually background free experiment.
To identify these \Bapp, chemical sensors are being explored as a key tool by
the NEXT collaboration . Although used in many fields, the application of such
chemosensors to the field of particle physics is totally novel and requires
experimental demonstration of their suitability in the ultra-dry environment of
a xenon gas chamber. Here we use a combination of complementary surface science
techniques to unambiguously show that Ba$^{+2}$ ions can be trapped (chelated)
in vacuum by an organic molecule, the so-called fluorescent bicolour indicator
(FBI) (one of the chemosensors developed by NEXT), immobilized on a surface. We
unravel the ion capture mechanism once the molecules are immobilised on Au(111)
surface and explain the origin of the emission fluorescence shift associated to
the trapping of different ions. Moreover, we prove that chelation also takes
place on a technologically relevant substrate, as such, demonstrating the
feasibility of using FBI indicators as building blocks of a Ba$^{+2}$ detector.

Networks (GNNs) based methods have achieved excellent performance for
spatio-temporal forecasting. However, the canonical GNNs-based methods only
individually model the local graph of meteorological variables per station or
the global graph of whole stations, lacking information interaction between

cross-regional spatio-temporal correlations among meteorological variables in

convolution are employed to construct self-learning graph and study hidden
dependency among nodes of variable-level and station-level graph. For capturing
temporal pattern, the dilated inception as the backbone of gate temporal
convolution is designed to model long and various meteorological trends.
Moreover, a dynamic interaction learning is proposed to build bidirectional
information passing in hierarchical graph. Experimental results on three
real-world meteorological datasets demonstrate the superior performance of
HiSTGNN beyond 7 baselines and it reduces the errors by 4.2% to 11.6%

The potential is calculated for a point mass in all the globally homogeneous
regular spherical topologies, i.e. whose fundamental domain is unique and is a
platonic solid. We provide the exact solution and the Taylor expansion series
of the potential at a test position near the point mass. We show that the odd
terms of the expansion can be interpreted as coming from the presence of a
non-zero spatial scalar curvature, while the even terms relate to the closed
nature of the topological space. A consequence is that, compared to the point
mass solution in a 3-torus, widely used in Newtonian cosmological simulations,
the spherical cases all feature an additional attractive first order term
dependent solely on the spatial curvature. The choice of topology only affects
the potential at second order and higher. For typical estimates of cosmological
scales (curvature and topology), the strongest topological effect occurs in the
case of the Poincar\'e dodecahedral space, but in general the effect of
curvature dominates over topology. We also provide the set of equations that

counterparty and thus providing a more accurate estimate of the Mark-to-market
value of a financial claim. In contrast to the risk-free closeout, the
replacement closeout renders a nonlinear valuation system, which constitutes
the major difficulty in the valuation of the counterparty credit risk.
  In this paper, we show how to address the nonlinearity attributed to the
replacement closeout in the theoretical and computational analysis. In the
theoretical part, we prove the unique solvability of the nonlinear valuation
system and study the impact of the replacement closeout on the credit valuation
adjustment. In the computational part, we propose a neural network-based
algorithm for solving the (high dimensional) nonlinear valuation system and
effectively alleviating the curse of dimensionality. We numerically compare the
computational cost for the valuations with risk-free and replacement closeouts.
The numerical tests confirm both the accuracy and the computational efficiency
of our proposed algorithm for the valuation of the replacement closeout.

as the greybody factor for a Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) immersed in
quintessence and associated with a cloud of strings. Primarily, we study the
Dirac equation using a null tetrad in the Newman- Penrose (NP) formalism. Next,
we separate the Dirac equation into radial and angular sets. Using the radial
equations, we study the profile of effective potential by transforming the
radial equation of motion into standard Schr% \""{o}dinger wave equations form
through tortoise coordinate. Similarly, we study the Klein-Gordan equation in
this spacetime. The Miller-Good transformation method is employed to compute
the greybody factor of bosons. To compute the Gerybody factor for fermions, we
use the general method of semi-analytical bounds. We also investigate the
effect of string clouds and quintessence parameters on Hawking radiation.
According to the results, the greybody factor is strongly influenced by the
shape of the potential, which is determined by the model parameters. This is
consistent with the ideas of quantum mechanics; as the potential rises, it
becomes harder for the wave to penetrate.

relationship depends on whether the payoff distribution of the market portfolio
satisfies a technical condition called adequacy, meaning that it is atomless or
is comprised of finitely many equally probable atoms. Under adequacy, pricing
kernel nonmonotonicity is equivalent to the existence of a strong form of
stochastic arbitrage involving distributional replication of the market
portfolio at a lower price. If the adequacy condition is dropped then this
equivalence no longer holds, but pricing kernel nonmonotonicity remains
equivalent to the existence of a weaker form of stochastic arbitrage involving
second-order stochastic dominance of the market portfolio at a lower price. A
generalization of the optimal measure preserving derivative is obtained which
achieves distributional replication at the minimum cost of all second-order
stochastically dominant securities under adequacy.

cuSZ is a version of SZ designed to take advantage of the GPU's power. At
present, cuSZ's compression performance has been optimized significantly while
its decompression still suffers considerably lower performance because of its
sophisticated lossless compression step -- a customized Huffman decoding. In
this work, we aim to significantly improve the Huffman decoding performance for
cuSZ, thus improving the overall decompression performance in turn. To this
end, we first investigate two state-of-the-art GPU Huffman decoders in depth.
Then, we propose a deep architectural optimization for both algorithms.
Specifically, we take full advantage of CUDA GPU architectures by using shared

significant superiority of the causal approach over previous conditional models

backscatter of energy from unresolved to resolved turbulent scales, but
excessive model backscatter can eventually result in numerical instability. A
commonly employed strategy to overcome this issue is to set predicted subgrid
stresses to zero in regions of model backscatter. This clipping procedure
improves the stability of structural models, however, at the cost of reduced
correlation between the predicted subgrid stresses and the exact subgrid
stresses. In this article, we propose an alternative strategy that removes
model backscatter from model predictions through the solution of a constrained
minimization problem. This procedure, which we refer to as optimal clipping,
results in a parameter-free mixed model, and it yields predicted subgrid
stresses in higher correlation with the exact subgrid stresses as compared with
those attained with the traditional clipping procedure. We perform a series of
a priori and a posteriori tests to investigate the impact of applying the
traditional and optimal clipping procedures to Clark's gradient subgrid stress

strong photometric variability. The Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey of SDSS-IV
includes repeat spectroscopy of large numbers of previously-known quasars, many
selected irrespective of photometric variability, and with spectral epochs
separated by months to decades. Our visual examination of these repeat spectra

We quantitatively compare spectral epochs to measure changes in continuum and
H$\beta$ broad line emission, finding 19 CLQs, of which 15 are

study tends to find objects that have dimmed, i.e., turn-off CLQs. However, we

find that it is not always optimal to engineer training sets to exactly match

mechanisms of the human brain and made accessible as novelty style
human-machine interfaces. However, not everything that we gaze upon, is
something we want to interact with; this is known as the Midas Touch problem
for gaze interfaces. To overcome the Midas Touch problem, present interfaces
tend not to rely on natural gaze cues, but rather use dwell time or gaze
gestures. Here we present an entirely data-driven approach to decode human
intention for object manipulation tasks based solely on natural gaze cues. We
run data collection experiments where 16 participants are given manipulation
and inspection tasks to be performed on various objects on a table in front of
them. The subjects' eye movements are recorded using wearable eye-trackers
allowing the participants to freely move their head and gaze upon the scene. We
use our Semantic Fovea, a convolutional neural network model to obtain the
objects in the scene and their relation to gaze traces at every frame. We then
evaluate the data and examine several ways to model the classification task for
intention prediction. Our evaluation shows that intention prediction is not a
naive result of the data, but rather relies on non-linear temporal processing
of gaze cues. We model the task as a time series classification problem and
design a bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network architecture to
decode intentions. Our results show that we can decode human intention of
motion purely from natural gaze cues and object relative position, with
$91.9\%$ accuracy. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of natural gaze as a
Zero-UI interface for human-machine interaction, i.e., users will only need to
act naturally, and do not need to interact with the interface itself or deviate
from their natural eye movement patterns.

extratropics. Where balanced motion dominates, the SSH spectral density is
averaged over all pass segments in a region for each calendar month, and is fit
to a 4-parameter model consisting of a flat plateau at low wavenumbers, a
transition at wavenumber $k_0$ to a red power law spectrum $k^{-s}$, and a
white spectrum at high wavenumbers that models the altimeter noise. The monthly
time series of the model parameters are compared to the evolution of the mixed
layer. The annual mode of the spectral slope $s$ reaches a minimum after the
mixed layer deepens, and the annual mode of the bandpassed kinetic energy in
the ranges $[2k_0,4 k_0]$ and $[k_0,2 k_0]$ peak $\sim$2 and $\sim$4 months,

This analysis is consistent with an energization of the submesoscale by a
winter mixed layer instability followed by an inverse cascade to the mesoscale,

results are compared to prior modeling, in situ, and satellite investigations

Decomposed queries are presented to retrieve row and column attentions

is trained using images without background; then with these layers frozen,
train the rest of the network with cross-entropy loss to classify the objects.

of stellar masses is a prerequisite to understanding evolution and feedback of
low-metallicity massive stars. Using abundant spectroscopic and photometric
measurements of an outstandingly bright eclipsing binary, we compare its
dynamic, spectroscopic, and evolutionary mass estimates and develop a binary
evolution scenario. We comprehensively studied the eclipsing binary system, AzV
476, in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The light curve and radial velocities were
analyzed to obtain the orbital parameters. The photometric and spectroscopic
data in the UV and optical were analyzed using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model
atmospheres. The obtained results are interpreted using binary-evolution
tracks. AzV 476 consists of an O4IV-III((f))p primary and an O9.5:Vn secondary.
Both components have similar current masses (~20 M$_{\odot}$) obtained from
both the orbital and spectroscopic analysis. The wind mass-loss rate of
log($\dot{M}$/(M$_{\odot}$/yr))=-6.2 of the primary is a factor of ten higher
than a recent empirical prescription for single O stars in the SMC. Only
close-binary evolution with mass transfer can reproduce the current stellar and
orbital parameters. The binary evolutionary model reveals that the primary has
lost about half of its initial mass and is already core helium burning. Our
comprehensive analysis of AzV 476 yields a consistent set of parameters and
suggests previous case B mass transfer. The derived stellar masses agree within
their uncertainties. The moderate masses of AzV 476 underline the scarcity of
bright massive stars in the SMC. The core helium burning nature of the primary
indicates that stripped stars might be hidden among OB-type populations.

strategy. Compared to the single-agent adversary (SAA), multi-agents in MAAS

the unique feature that distinguishes animal movement from mere particle
movement in chemistry or physics. Hence, it is essential to incorporate such
knowledge-based processes into animal movement models. Here, we summarize
popular deterministic mathematical models derived from first principles that
begin to incorporate such influences on movement behaviour mechanisms. Most
generally, these models take the form of nonlocal reaction-diffusion-advection
equations, where the nonlocality may appear in the spatial domain, the temporal
domain, or both. Mathematical rules of thumb are provided to judge the model
rationality, to aid in model development or interpretation, and to streamline
an understanding of the range of difficulty in possible model conceptions. To
emphasize the importance of biological conclusions drawn from these models, we
briefly present available mathematical techniques and introduce some existing
""measures of success"" to compare and contrast the possible predictions and
outcomes. Throughout the review, we propose numerous open problems relevant to
this relatively new area, ranging from precise technical mathematical
challenges to broader conceptual challenges at the cross-section between
mathematics and ecology. This review paper is expected to act as a synthesis of

AI systems. Among these are algorithmic personality tests that use insights
from psychometric testing, and promise to surface personality traits indicative
of future success based on job seekers' resumes or social media profiles. We
interrogate the validity of such systems using stability of the outputs they
produce, noting that reliability is a necessary, but not a sufficient,
condition for validity. Our approach is to (a) develop a methodology for an
external audit of stability of predictions made by algorithmic personality
tests, and (b) instantiate this methodology in an audit of two systems,
Humantic AI and Crystal. Crucially, rather than challenging or affirming the
assumptions made in psychometric testing -- that personality is a meaningful
and measurable construct, and that personality traits are indicative of future
success on the job -- we frame our methodology around testing the underlying
assumptions made by the vendors of the algorithmic personality tests
themselves.
  Our main contribution is the development of a socio-technical framework for
auditing the stability of algorithmic systems. This contribution is
supplemented with an open-source software library that implements the technical
components of the audit, and can be used to conduct similar stability audits of
algorithmic systems. We instantiate our framework with the audit of two
real-world personality prediction systems, namely Humantic AI and Crystal. The
application of our audit framework demonstrates that both these systems show
substantial instability with respect to key facets of measurement, and hence
cannot be considered valid testing instruments.

using the keyframes, which are a small subset of the total video frames.
Instead of processing thousands of frames, only a few frames are processed
depending on the number of keyframes. There is a trade-off between the
computation of many frames and the speed of the captioning process. The
approach in this research is to allow the user to specify the trade-off between
execution time and accuracy. In addition, we argue that linking images, videos,
and natural language offers many practical benefits and immediate practical
applications. From the modeling perspective, instead of designing and staging
explicit algorithms to process videos and generate captions in complex

architectures to apply in long videos by captioning video keyframes. We

cavity modes are coupled with a massive yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere
through magnetic dipole interaction. The nonlinearity used in our system
originates from a squeezed driving via parametric down-conversion process,
which is the reason to cause entanglement and squeezing. By using the mean
field approximation and employing experimentally feasible parameters, we
demonstrate that the system shows zero entanglement and squeezing without
squeezed driving. Meanwhile, our QED system denotes that the entanglement
between squeezed cavity mode and magnon mode can be transferred to the other
cavity mode and magnon mode via magnon-cavity coupling interaction, and then
the two cavity modes get entangled. A genuinely tripartite entangled state is
formed. We also show that magnon mode can be prepared in a squeezed state via
magnon-cavity beam-splitter interaction, which is as a result of the squeezed
field. Moreover, we show that it is a good way to enhance entanglement and
squeezing by increasing the nonlinear gain coefficient of squeezed driving. Our
results denote that magnon-cavity QED system is a powerful platform for
studying macroscopic quantum phenomena, which illustrates a new method to
photon-photon entanglement and magnon squeezing.

the largest spatial dispersion, it can introduce the best beam-smoothing effect

only two gratings, the total compression efficiency of the SSGP main compressor
is even larger than that of a four-grating main compressor. Furthermore, the
spatiotemporal aberration induced by single-grating-pair can be compensated

main interest is, whether or not the strengths of the bottomonium-nuclear
matter and charmonium-nuclear matter interactions are similar or very
different, in the range of a few tens of MeV at the nuclear matter saturation
density. This is because, each ($\Upsilon,J/\Psi$) and ($\eta_c,\eta_b$) meson
group is usually assumed to have very similar properties based on the heavy
charm and bottom quark masses. The estimate for the $\Upsilon$ is made using an
SU(5) effective Lagrangian density, by studying the $BB$, $BB^*$, and $B^*B^*$
meson loop contributions for the self-energy in free space and in nuclear
medium. As a result, only the $BB$ meson loop contribution is included as our
minimal prediction. As for the $\eta_b$, is included only the $BB^*$ meson loop
contribution in the self-energy, to be consistent with the minimal prediction
for the $\Upsilon$. The in-medium masses of the $B$ and $B^{*}$ mesons
appearing in the self-energy loops are calculated by the quark-meson coupling
model. Form factors are used to regularize the loop integrals with a wide range

These can progress to filter bubbles, actively filtering contrasting opinions,
resulting in vulnerability to misinformation and increased polarisation on

better understanding of how echo chambers manifest in different discussions

strong evidence that the stance people took on marriage equality in 2017 did
not predict their political stance in discussions around the Australian federal
election two years later. Although mostly isolated from each other, we observe
that in certain situations the polarised groups may interact with the broader

on ODoS filter and shape features is presented for pulmonary fissure
segmentation. Here, we adopt an ODoS filter by merging the orientation
information and magnitude information to highlight structure features for
fissure enhancement, which can effectively distinguish between pulmonary
fissures and clutters. Motivated by the fact that pulmonary fissures appear as
linear structures in 2D space and planar structures in 3D space in orientation
field, an orientation curvature criterion and an orientation partition scheme
are fused to separate fissure patches and other structures in different
orientation partition, which can suppress parts of clutters. Considering the
shape difference between pulmonary fissures and tubular structures in magnitude
field, a shape measure approach and a 3D skeletonization model are combined to
segment pulmonary fissures for clutters removal. When applying our scheme to 55

disjointness relations, a generalisation of the orthogonality relations of

relativistic AQFTs. By identifying appropriate chiral disjointness relations,
we construct a category $\chi\mathsf{Loc}$ suitable as domain for chiral
conformal field theories (CFTs) in two dimensions. We compare this to an

practical applications. Most prior works treat partial or full videos as a
whole, ignoring rich action knowledge hidden in videos, i.e., semantic
consistencies among different partial videos. In contrast, we partition
original partial or full videos to form a new series of partial videos and mine
the Action Semantic Consistent Knowledge (ASCK) among these new partial videos
evolving in arbitrary progress levels. Moreover, a novel Rich Action-semantic

proposed for EAP. Firstly, we use a two-stream pre-trained model to extract

videos as nodes and their action semantic consistencies as edges. Next, we
build a bi-directional semantic graph for the teacher network and a
single-directional semantic graph for the student network to model rich ASCK

distillation loss to enrich the ASCK of partial videos from the teacher to the

the complex systems in Smart Manufacturing, improved anomaly detection
frameworks are needed to reduce the operational risks and the monitoring burden
placed on the system operators. However, building such frameworks is
challenging, as a sufficiently large amount of defective training data is often
not available and frameworks are required to capture both the temporal and
contextual dependencies across different time steps while being robust to
noise. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Attention-based Convolutional
Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Autoencoder with Dynamic Thresholding
(ACLAE-DT) framework for anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time
series. The framework starts by pre-processing and enriching the data, before
constructing feature images to characterize the system statuses across
different time steps by capturing the inter-correlations between pairs of time
series. Afterwards, the constructed feature images are fed into an
attention-based ConvLSTM autoencoder, which aims to encode the constructed
feature images and capture the temporal behavior, followed by decoding the
compressed knowledge representation to reconstruct the feature images input.
The reconstruction errors are then computed and subjected to a
statistical-based, dynamic thresholding mechanism to detect and diagnose the
anomalies. Evaluation results conducted on real-life manufacturing data
demonstrate the performance strengths of the proposed approach over
state-of-the-art methods under different experimental settings.

calculations. For interacting electrons, given that the internal part of the
Hamiltonian ($\hat H_{int}$), containing the kinetic energy and Couloumb
interaction of electrons, has a fixed form, the theorem states that when the
electrons are subject to an external electrostatic field, the ground-state
density can inversely determine the field, and thus the full Hamiltonian
completely. For a general quantum system, a HK-type Hamiltonian in the form of
$\hat H_{hk}\{g_i\}=\hat H_{int}+\sum_i g_i \hat O_i$ can always be defined, by
grouping those terms with fixed or preknown coefficients into $\hat H_{int}$,
and factorizing the remaining as superposition of a set of Hermitian operators
$\{\hat O_i\}$. We ask whether the HK theorem can be extended, so that the
ground-state expectation values of $\{\hat O_i\}$ as the generalized density
can in principle be used as the fundamental variables determining all the
properties of the system. We show that the question can be addressed by
introducing the concept of generalized density correlation matrix (GDCM)
defined with respect to the $\{\hat O_i\}$ operators. The invertibility of the
GDCM represents a mathematically rigorous and practically useful criterion for
the extension of HK theorem to be valid. We apply this criterion to several
representative systems, including the quantum Ising dimer, the frustration-free
systems, N-level quantum systems with fixed inter-level transition amplitude
and tunable level energies, and a fermionic Hubbard chain with inhomogeneous
on-site interactions. We suggest that for a finite-size system, finding an
invertible GDCM under one single $\{g_i\}$ configuration is typically
sufficient to establish the generic extensibility of the HK theorem in the
entire parameter space.

commonly used to model state transitions in cases such as these, and the
incorporation of random effects can be used to introduce diurnal effects. While
state labels can be derived prior to modeling dynamics, this approach omits
informative regression covariates that can influence state memberships. We
instead propose an alternating recurrent event proportional hazards (PH)
regression to model the transitions between latent states. We propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for imputing latent state labels and
estimating regression parameters. We show that our E-step simplifies to the
hidden Markov model (HMM) forward-backward algorithm, allowing us to recover a

that PH modeling of discrete-time transitions implicitly penalizes the logistic

to study the dynamics of these waves. Tracking the trajectory of a spiral-wave
tip can reveal important dynamical features of a spiral wave, such as its
periodicity, and its vulnerability to instabilities. We show how to employ the
data-driven spectral-decomposition method, called dynamic mode decomposition
(DMD), to detect a spiral tip trajectory (TT) in three settings: (1) a
homogeneous medium; (2) a heterogeneous medium; and (3) with external noise. We
demonstrate that the performance of DMD-based TT (DMDTT) is either comparable

isopotential-intersection method (IIM) in the cases (1)-(3): (1) Both IIM and
DMDTT capture TT patterns at small values of the image-sampling interval

In a heterogeneous medium, IIM yields TT patterns, but with a background of
scattered noisy points, which is suppresed in DMDTT. (3) DMDTT is more robust
to external noise than IIM. We show, finally, that DMD can be used to

convolutional neural network (CNN) testing, enabling a CNN model developer to
convince a user of the truthful CNN performance over non-public data from

efficiency issues, three new efforts are done by appropriately integrating
homomorphic encryption (HE) and zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive
argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) primitives with the CNN testing. First, a CNN
model to be tested is strategically partitioned into a private part kept
locally by the model developer, and a public part outsourced to an outside
server. Then, the private part runs over HE-protected test data sent by a
tester and transmits its outputs to the public part for accomplishing
subsequent computations of the CNN testing. Second, the correctness of the
above CNN testing is enforced by generating zk-SNARK based proofs, with an
emphasis on optimizing proving overhead for two-dimensional (2-D) convolution
operations, since the operations dominate the performance bottleneck during
generating proofs. We specifically present a new quadratic matrix programs
(QMPs)-based arithmetic circuit with a single multiplication gate for
expressing 2-D convolution operations between multiple filters and inputs in a
batch manner. Third, we aggregate multiple proofs with respect to a same CNN
model but different testers' test data (i.e., different statements) into one
proof, and ensure that the validity of the aggregated proof implies the
validity of the original multiple proofs. Lastly, our experimental results
demonstrate that our QMPs-based zk-SNARK performs nearly 13.9$\times$faster
than the existing QAPs-based zk-SNARK in proving time, and 17.6$\times$faster
in Setup time, for high-dimension matrix multiplication.

These regression models are often fitted by regularized likelihood-based
estimation, while ignoring how the fitted functions are used in the subsequent
inference about the treatment parameters. Such separate estimation can be
associated with known difficulties in existing methods. We develop regularized
calibrated estimation for fitting propensity score and outcome regression
models, where sparsity-including penalties are employed to facilitate variable

confidence intervals can be obtained under possible model misspecification.
Unlike in the case of binary treatments, the usual augmented IPW estimator is
generalized by allowing different copies of coefficient estimators in outcome

new loss function and estimating functions are directly tied to achieving
covariate balance between weighted treatment groups. We develop practical
numerical algorithms for computing the regularized calibrated estimators with
group Lasso by innovatively exploiting Fisher scoring, and provide rigorous
high-dimensional analysis for the resulting augmented IPW estimators under

simulates an annealing process to search over the space of topological sorts,

distributed optimization method. This distributed optimization relies on
multiple rounds of communication between local and central machines to estimate
the optimal structure. We establish its convergence to a global optimizer of
the overall score that is computed on all data across local machines. To the
best of our knowledge, DARLS is the first distributed method for learning
causal graphs with such theoretical guarantees. Through extensive simulation

continual learning models. Specifically, a novel gradient learner learns from
labeled data to predict gradients on unlabeled data. Hence, the unlabeled data
could fit into the supervised continual learning method. Different from
conventional semi-supervised settings, we do not hypothesize that the
underlying classes, which are associated to the unlabeled data, are known to
the learning process. In other words, the unlabeled data could be very distinct

The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification
accuracy and backward transfer in the continual learning setting while
achieving desired performance on classification accuracy in the semi-supervised

be available. In this paper, we study the problem of one-shot learning on
attributed sequences, where each instance is composed of a set of attributes
(e.g., user profile) and a sequence of categorical items (e.g., clickstream).
This problem is important for a variety of real-world applications ranging from
fraud prevention to network intrusion detection. This problem is more
challenging than conventional one-shot learning since there are dependencies
between attributes and sequences. We design a deep learning framework OLAS to
tackle this problem. The proposed OLAS utilizes a twin network to generalize
the features from pairwise attributed sequence examples. Empirical results on
real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed OLAS can outperform the
state-of-the-art methods under a rich variety of parameter settings.

study how the intermediate features affect the network prediction. However,

This paper introduces a hierarchical decomposition framework to explain CNN's
decision-making process in a top-down manner. Specifically, we propose a
gradient-based activation propagation (gAP) module that can decompose any

Then we utilize the gAP module to iteratively decompose the network decision to
the supporting evidence from different CNN layers. The proposed framework can
generate a deep hierarchy of strongly associated supporting evidence for the

Moreover, gAP is effort-free for understanding CNN-based models without network

comprehensive fine-grained information. However, it underestimates the
importance of extracting robust feature representation and the impact of
feature alignment. The CNN-based methods have achieved great success in
cross-view geo-localization. However it still has some limitations, e.g., it
can only extract part of the information in the neighborhood and some scale
reduction operations will make some fine-grained information lost. In
particular, we introduce a simple and efficient transformer-based structure
called Feature Segmentation and Region Alignment (FSRA) to enhance the model's
ability to understand contextual information as well as to understand the
distribution of instances. Without using additional supervisory information,
FSRA divides regions based on the heat distribution of the transformer's
feature map, and then aligns multiple specific regions in different views one
on one. Finally, FSRA integrates each region into a set of feature
representations. The difference is that FSRA does not divide regions manually,
but automatically based on the heat distribution of the feature map. So that
specific instances can still be divided and aligned when there are significant
shifts and scale changes in the image. In addition, a multiple sampling
strategy is proposed to overcome the disparity in the number of satellite
images and that of images from other sources. Experiments show that the
proposed method has superior performance and achieves the state-of-the-art in

program contains a Python feature with no corresponding symbolic representation

To achieve this, Terra builds a symbolic graph by decoupling DL operations from

execution. We evaluated the performance improvement and coverage of Terra with
ten imperative DL programs for several DNN architectures. The results show that
Terra can speed up the execution of all ten imperative DL programs, whereas

activity consists of establishing the extent to which actual executions of a
process conform the expected behavior of a reference model. Current techniques
focus on prescriptive models of the control-flow as references. In certain
scenarios, however, a prescriptive model might not be available and,
additionally, the control-flow perspective might not be ideal for this purpose.
This paper tackles these two problems by suggesting a conformance approach that
uses a descriptive model (i.e., a pattern of the observed behavior over a
certain amount of time) which is not necessarily referring to the control-flow
(e.g., it can be based on the social network of handover of work).
Additionally, the entire approach can work both offline and online, thus
providing feedback in real time. The approach, which is implemented in ProM,
has been tested and results from 3 experiments with real world as well as

weighting scheme on the generalization error of the learning method, where we
derive explicit generalization errors for the random Fourier feature model in

accounts for the radial as well as vertical transfer of the starlight
reprocessed at the disk surface. The model thus allows us to compute the
temperature below ""shadowed"" surfaces receiving no direct starlight. Thanks to
the assumed axisymmetry, the reprocessed starlight flux is given in
one-dimensional integral form that can be computed at a low cost. Furthermore,
our model evolves the midplane temperature using a time-dependent energy
equation and can therefore treat thermal instabilities. We apply our global
two-layer model to disks with a planetary induced gap and confirm that the
model reproduces the disks' temperature profiles obtained from more
computationally expensive Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations to an
accuracy of less than 20%. We also apply the model to study the long-term

computationally efficient, the global two-layer model will be suitable for

exposed via a public API by repeatedly querying it and adjusting their own
model based on obtained predictions. To prevent model stealing, existing
defenses focus on detecting malicious queries, truncating, or distorting
outputs, thus necessarily introducing a tradeoff between robustness and model
utility for legitimate users. Instead, we propose to impede model extraction by
requiring users to complete a proof-of-work before they can read the model's
predictions. This deters attackers by greatly increasing (even up to 100x) the
computational effort needed to leverage query access for model extraction.
Since we calibrate the effort required to complete the proof-of-work to each
query, this only introduces a slight overhead for regular users (up to 2x). To
achieve this, our calibration applies tools from differential privacy to
measure the information revealed by a query. Our method requires no
modification of the victim model and can be applied by machine learning
practitioners to guard their publicly exposed models against being easily
stolen.

assessment and maintaining the stable operation in power systems. The wide
deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) promotes the development of
data-driven approaches for transient stability assessment. This paper proposes
the temporal and topological embedding deep neural network (TTEDNN) model to
forecast transient stability with the early transient dynamics. The TTEDNN
model can accurately and efficiently predict the transient stability by
extracting the temporal and topological features from the time-series data of
the early transient dynamics. The grid-informed adjacency matrix is used to
incorporate the power grid structural and electrical parameter information. The
transient dynamics simulation environments under the single-node and
multiple-node perturbations are used to test the performance of the TTEDNN
model for the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 118-bus power systems. The results show that
the TTEDNN model has the best and most robust prediction performance.
Furthermore, the TTEDNN model also demonstrates the transfer capability to
predict the transient stability in the more complicated transient dynamics
simulation environments.

the inverse-square law as does that of the flux of radio pulses. However,
results of testing the hypothesis of independence of luminosities and distances
of gamma-ray pulsars by means of the Efron--Petrosian statistic imply that the
observational data in the second {\it FERMI} catalogue are consistent with the
dependence $S\propto D^{-3/2}$ of the flux densities $S$ of these pulsars on
their distances $D$ at substantially higher levels of significance than they
are with the dependence $S\propto D^{-2}$. This is not incompatible with the
requirements of the conservation of energy because the radiation process

intrinsically transient: the difference in the fluxes of power across any two
spheres centred on the star is balanced by the change with time of the energy
contained inside the shell bounded by those spheres. Once the over-estimation
of their values is rectified, the luminosities of gamma-ray pulsars turn out to
have the same range of values as do the luminosities of radio pulsars.

(FV) to half-valley-metal (HVM) to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) to HVM to FV
transitions can be driven by increasing electron correlation $U$. However,
there are no special QAH states and valley polarization for in-plane magnetic
anisotropy. By calculating actual magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE), the VQAHI
indeed can exist between two HVM states due to PMA, a unit Chern number/a
chiral edge state and spontaneous valley polarization. The increasing $U$ can
induce VQAHI, which can be explained by sign-reversible Berry curvature or band
inversion between $d_{xy}$/$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Even though
the real $U$ falls outside the range, the VQAHI can be achieved by strain.

change from a common ferromagentic (FM) semiconductor to VQAHI under about

chiral-spin-valley locking, which can achieve complete spin and valley
polarizations for low-dissipation electronics devices. Both energy band gap and

breaking the time-reversal symmetry, as long as the system is
noncentrosymmetric. There are multiple mechanisms with different scaling rules
that contribute to the nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE). The intrinsic contribution
is closely related to the Berry curvature dipole and has been extensively
investigated recently. The study of the extrinsic contribution, however, is
scarce, although it can enter the NLHE even in the leading order. Here, we
report a giant nonlinear transport response in TBG, in which the intrinsic
mechanism is forbidden. The magnitude and direction of the second-order
nonlinearity can be effectively tuned by the gate voltage. The peak value of
the second-order Hall conductivity close to the full filling of the moir\'e
band reaches 8.76 ${\mu}mSV^{-1}$, four-order larger than those detected in
$WTe_2$. The observed giant second-order nonlinearity can be understood from
the collaboration of the asymmetric scattering of electrons off the static
(Coulomb impurities) and dynamic disorders (phonons) in noncentrosymmetric
crystals. It is mainly determined by the skew-scattering contribution from
impurities at 1.7 K. The skew-scattering from phonons has a much larger
coupling coefficient as suggested by the scaling results, and becomes as
important as the impurity contribution as the temperature rises. Our
observations demonstrate the potential of TBG in studying nonlinear response
and possible rectification applications.

timing properties of the Timepix3, a hybrid pixel detector developed by the
Medipix collaboration. These studies use three different measurement techniques
to investigate the timing systematics of this detector: test pulses, testbeam,
and a laser setup that we build for this work. The average delay over the pixel
matrix is determined with the testbeam and the laser and shows the same
structure for different Timepix3 chips. The difference in delay results in a
maximum difference over the pixel matrix of around 4 ns, which is large
compared to the time bins of 1.56 ns. By correcting for this difference on a
per-pixel level, the time resolution is on average improved with 159 ps
depending on the sensor. The best time resolution that is achieved after a
timewalk correction and a correction for the difference in the average delay
per pixel is 686.4$\pm$0.2 ps for a single Timepix3 chip with a 200
$\mu\text{m}$ planar silicon sensor, compared to a time resolution of
892.9$\pm$0.3 ps without any correction. However, this improved time resolution
is not yet the naively expected time resolution of 451 ps. The origin of this
delay is determined with this laser setup, and is due to a combination of
signal propagation and a difference of the start-up time of the fast oscillator
within the pixels. This work indicates that it is vital for next generation
pixel detectors to correct for these systematic timing effects in order to
reach a better time resolution to aid 4D tracking technology in the HL-LHC.

hybrid journals in four subject areas, and the citations received by such

journals were randomly selected from those with share of OA papers higher than
some minimal value. More than 60 thousand research articles were analyzed in
the sample, of which 24% under the OA modality. As results, we obtain that
cites per article in both hybrid modalities strongly correlate. However, there
is no correlation between the OA prevalence and cites per article in any of the
hybrid modalities. There is OA citation advantage in 80% of hybrid journals.
Moreover, the OA citation advantage is consistent across fields and held in

(MHE) is used to estimate the vehicle states with the help of relative bearing
information to known landmarks and other vehicles. The goal of the NMPC is to
devise optimal paths for each vehicle between a given source and destination

covariance in the NMPC is computationally intensive, hence we develop an
approximate analytical closed form expression based on the relationship between
covariance and path lengths to landmarks. Using this expression while computing
NMPC commands reduces the computational complexity significantly. We present
numerical simulations to validate the proposed approach for different numbers
of vehicles and landmark configurations. We also compare the results with
EKF-based estimation to show the superiority of the proposed closed form

the satisfactory performance for MIPS problem since inner product is a

  Graph based methods for NNS problem show the superiorities compared with
other class methods. Each data point of the database is mapped to a node of the
proximity graph. Nearest neighbor search in the database can be converted to
route on the proximity graph to find the nearest neighbor for the query. This
technique can be used to solve MIPS problem. Instead of searching the nearest

to train an agent to search on the proximity graph automatically for MIPS

the phase change on reflection at the layer boundaries compensates for the
change in phase due to propagation over the layer. At this value of the gain,
the gain-assisted mode forms, in which the phase shift during a round trip of

positive gain in the dielectric medium, and can be used to create dielectric

release two covering nanohertz frequencies, we search for such a phase

temperature $T_\star\in$ [66 MeV, 30 GeV], which indicates that dark or QCD
phase transitions occurring below 66 MeV have been ruled out at $2\,\sigma$
confidence level. This constraint is much tighter than $T_\star\sim$ [1 MeV,
100 GeV] from NANOGrav. We also give much tighter $2\,\sigma$ bounds on the PT
duration $H_\star/\beta>0.1$, strength $\alpha_\star>0.39$ and friction
$\eta<2.74$ than NANOGrav. For the first time, we find a positive correlation

To avoid large theoretical uncertainties in calculating PT spectrum, we make
bubble spectral shape parameters $a$, $b$, $c$ and four PT parameters free

sensitive to the parameter $a$, and give the first clear constraint
$a=1.27_{-0.54}^{+0.71}$ at $1\,\sigma$ confidence level.

characterize winning conditions that are determined in finite-memory
strategies. Infinite-duration games are usually studied over edge-colored
graphs, with winning conditions that are defined in terms of sequences of
colors. In this paper, we investigate a restricted class of finite-memory
strategies called chromatic finite-memory strategies. While general
finite-memory strategies operate with sequences of edges of a game graph,
chromatic finite-memory strategies observe only colors of these edges.
  Recent results in this area show that studying finite-memory determinacy is
more tractable when we restrict ourselves to chromatic strategies. On the other
hand, as was shown by Le Roux (CiE 2020), determinacy in general finite-memory
strategies implies determinacy in chromatic finite-memory strategies.
Unfortunately, this result is quite inefficient in terms of the state
complexity: to replace a winning strategy with few states of general memory, we
might need much more states of chromatic memory. The goal of the present paper
is to find out the exact state complexity of this transformation.
  For every winning condition and for every game graph with $n$ nodes we show
the following: if this game graph has a winning strategy with $q$ states of
general memory, then it also has a winning strategy with $(q + 1)^n$ states of
chromatic memory. We also show that this bound is almost tight. For every $q$
and $n$, we construct a winning condition and a game graph with $n + O(1)$
nodes, where one can win with $q$ states of general memory, but not with $q^n -
1$ states of chromatic memory.

silicate-graphite mixture dust model characterized by exponentially cutoff
power-law size distributions can well reproduce its unusual extinction curves.
The best-fit results show that the extinctions derived from the dust models are
consistent with the observed values at all epochs. However, the
total-to-selective extinction ratio $R_V$ is about 2.8 - 3.1, which is
significantly smaller than the value of $R_V \approx 6.4$ derived by Gall et
al. The best-fit models indicate that the dust grains around SN 2010jl are
possibly composed of small-size astronomical silicate grains and micron-size
graphite grains. In addition, by fitting the optical to mid-infrared spectral
energy distribution, we find that the dust mass around SN 2010jl increases with

tackle this challenging problem and suggest a novel approach of using
metamaterials with extreme parameters to enable targeted and protected wireless
energy transfer. We design and experimentally implement epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)

transmission if and only if both the transmitter and the receiver are equipped
with these metamaterials. The fact of absence of materials with such extreme
parameters protects the system against surrounding objects, which cause neither
noticeable change in the system operation nor experience any detrimental
effect. The system behind the proposed approach can be realised in virtually
any frequency band by appropriate scaling and suitable choice of material. This

remarkable improvement. However, those prevailing approaches rarely consider
incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured
knowledge facts for better protein representations. We argue that informative
biology knowledge in KGs can enhance protein representation with external
knowledge. In this work, we propose OntoProtein, the first general framework
that makes use of structure in GO (Gene Ontology) into protein pre-training
models. We construct a novel large-scale knowledge graph that consists of GO
and its related proteins, and gene annotation texts or protein sequences
describe all nodes in the graph. We propose novel contrastive learning with
knowledge-aware negative sampling to jointly optimize the knowledge graph and
protein embedding during pre-training. Experimental results show that
OntoProtein can surpass state-of-the-art methods with pre-trained protein
language models in TAPE benchmark and yield better performance compared with
baselines in protein-protein interaction and protein function prediction. Code

monitoring and food safety. Typically, biosensors are designed to detect
specific analytes through functionalization with the appropriate capture
agents. However, the use of capture agents limits the number of analytes that
can be simultaneously detected and reduces the robustness of the biosensor. In
this work, we report a versatile, capture agent free biosensor platform based
on an array of porous silicon (PSi) thin films, which has the potential to
robustly detect a wide variety of analytes based on their physical and chemical
properties in the nanoscale porous media. The ability of this system to
reproducibly classify, quantify, and discriminate three proteins is
demonstrated to concentrations down to at least 0.02g/L (between 300nM and
450nM) by utilizing PSi array elements with a unique combination of pore size
and buffer pH, employing linear discriminant analysis for dimensionality
reduction, and using support vector machines as a classifier. This approach
represents a significant step towards a low cost, simple and robust biosensor
platform that is able to detect a vast range of biomolecules.

binary Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equations coupled with microwaves (electromagnetic
fields) in steady state. One is based on a normalized gradient flow
formulation, called the ASGF method, while the other on a perturbed, projected
conjugate gradient approach for the nonlinear constrained optimization, called
the PPNCG method. The coupled GP equations are nonlocal in space, describing
pseudo-spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) interacting with an
electromagnetic field. Our interest in this study is to develop efficient,
iterative numerical methods for steady symmetric and central vortex states of
the nonlocal GP equation systems. In the algorithms, the GP equations are
discretized by a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method in a polar coordinate in
two-dimensional (2D) space. The new algorithms are shown to outperform the
existing ones through a host of benchmark examples, among which the PPNCG
method performs the best. Additional numerical simulations of the central
vortex states are provided to demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of the
new algorithms.

countries. The aim of the present paper is to study the problems in revenue
administration in terms of tax revenue in Georgia and analyze foreign
experience in that respect. The main question arises here - What kind of tax
rates should be implemented to be able to perform both functions of the fiscal
and stimulating one. Liberal method of revenue seems an attractive one for
taxpayers. According to the economic situation in Georgia, the best solution is
to use the liberal method. This will help business to develop and people to
find jobs. Taxation system will also benefit from that. Tax rate in Georgia
amounts to 15% and is the same for everyone, regardless the size of the
business. The taxation system is regarded to be proportional. As for the
American and European countries, taxes there are progressive. I think the same
practice should be implemented in Georgia, and not only in case of taxation.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Text style transfer is a challenging text generation problem, which aims at
altering the style of a given sentence to a target one while keeping its
content unchanged. Since there is a natural scarcity of parallel datasets,
recent works mainly focus on solving the problem in an unsupervised manner.
However, previous gradient-based works generally suffer from the deficiencies
as follows, namely: (1) Content migration. Previous approaches lack explicit
modeling of content invariance and are thus susceptible to content shift
between the original sentence and the transferred one. (2) Style
misclassification. A natural drawback of the gradient-guided approaches is that
the inference process is homogeneous with a line of adversarial attack, making
latent optimization easily becomes an attack to the classifier due to
misclassification. This leads to difficulties in achieving high transfer
accuracy. To address the problems, we propose a novel gradient-guided model
through a contrastive paradigm for text style transfer, to explicitly gather
similar semantic sentences, and to design a siamese-structure based style
classifier for alleviating such two issues, respectively. Experiments on two
datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, as compared to the
state-of-the-arts.

of a charged Thomas oscillator in an external magnetic field. We do so by
adopting and then modifying the cyclically symmetric Thomas oscillator to study
the dynamics of a charged particle in an external magnetic field. These
dynamical behaviours for weak and strong field strength parameters fall under
two categories; conservative and dissipative. The system shows a complex
quasi-periodic attractor whose topology depends on initial conditions for high
field strengths in the conservative regime. There is a transition from
adiabatic motion to chaos on decreasing the field strength parameter. In the
dissipative regime, the system is chaotic for weak field strength and weak
damping but shows a limit cycle for high field strengths. Such behaviour is due
to an additional negative feedback loop that comes into action at high field
strengths and forces the system dynamics to be stable in periodic oscillations.
For weak damping and weak field strength, the system dynamics mimic Brownian
motion via chaotic walks.

problem. It is more difficulty for solving because values and weights depend on
items and elements respectively. In this paper, we present two self-adjusting
optimization algorithms for approximating SUKP from items and elements
perspective respectively. By analyzing the dynamic characters in the SUKP, we
design two types of self-adjusting repair and optimization operators that are
based on the different loading process. We use the novel
teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm (TLBO) to design a general
discrete framework (DTLBO) suitable for these two types of operators. In
addition, we introduce elite opposite search and natural selection mechanism
into DTLBO to furtherly improve the performance of the algorithm from the
perspective of population. Finally, we performed experimental comparisons on
benchmark sets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The
experimental results show that the item-based self-adjusting optimization
algorithm I-DTLBO is outstanding, and the algorithm is superior to the other
swarm intelligence methods for solving SUKP. IDTLBO algorithm reaches the upper
boundary of the current swarm intelligence algorithms for solving SUKP in 10
instances, and gotten new upper boundary in 15 instances. The algorithm E-DTLBO
based on element loading only perform slightly better on small and middle data
sets, but worse on large-scale instances. It shows that element-based design is
not suitable for solving SUKP.
