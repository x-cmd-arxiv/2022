enriched using graph neural networks. Our graph neural network is
structure-aware by having each node aggregate information from its local

  We evaluated the proposed method on 220 airway trees from subjects with
various severity stages of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The
results demonstrate that our approach is computationally efficient and
significantly improves branch classification performance than the baseline

all 18 segmental airway branches, compared to 83.83\% obtained by the standard

parameters leads to overfitting and poor performance. That modern deep neural
networks generalize well despite a large number of parameters contradicts this
finding and constitutes a major unsolved problem towards explaining the success
of deep learning. While previous work focuses on the implicit regularization
induced by stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we study here how the local
geometry of the energy landscape around local minima affects the statistical
properties of SGD with Gaussian gradient noise. We argue that under reasonable
assumptions, the local geometry forces SGD to stay close to a low dimensional
subspace and that this induces another form of implicit regularization and
results in tighter bounds on the generalization error for deep neural networks.
To derive generalization error bounds for neural networks, we first introduce a
notion of stagnation sets around the local minima and impose a local essential
convexity property of the population risk. Under these conditions, lower bounds
for SGD to remain in these stagnation sets are derived. If stagnation occurs,
we derive a bound on the generalization error of deep neural networks involving
the spectral norms of the weight matrices but not the number of network
parameters. Technically, our proofs are based on controlling the change of
parameter values in the SGD iterates and local uniform convergence of the
empirical loss functions based on the entropy of suitable neighborhoods around
local minima.

to convey extra information streams based on the concept of NOMA. Then, each
communication user detects the extra information streams and the existing
legacy information streams with the aid of successive interference cancellation
(SIC). Based on the proposed framework, a multiple-objective optimization
problem (MOOP) is formulated to characterize the trade-off between the
communication throughput and sensing beampattern accuracy. For the general
multiple-user scenario, the formulated MOOP is firstly converted to a
single-objective optimization problem via the e-constraint method. Then, a
double-layer block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed by employing
fractional programming and successive convex approximation to find a
high-quality sub-optimal solution. For the special single-user scenario, the
globally optimal solution can be obtained by transforming the MOOP into a
convex quadratic semidefinite program. Moreover, it is rigorously proved that
1) in the multiple-user scenario, the proposed NOMA-inspired ISAC framework
always outperforms the state-of-the-art sensing-interference-cancellation

extra information streams; 2) in the special single-user scenario, the proposed

interference it produces. This phenomenon results from the interference of
single-quanton amplitudes for various paths. The distinguishability of paths
puts a bound on the sharpness of the interference the quanton can produce.
However there exist other kinds of quantum phenomena where interference of
two-particle amplitudes results in a two-particle interference, if the
particles are indistinguishable. The Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect and the
Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect are two well known examples. However,
two-particle interference is not as easy to define as its single particle
counterpart, and the realization that it involves interference of two-particle
amplitudes, came much later. In this work, a duality relation, between the
particle distinguishability and the visibility of two-particle interference, is
derived. The distinguishability of the two particles, arising from some
internal degree of freedom, puts a bound on the sharpness of the two-particle
interference they can produce, in a HOM or HBT kind of experiment. It is argued
that the existence of this kind of complementarity can be used to characterize
two-particle interference, which in turn leads one to the conclusion that the
HOM and the HBT effects are equivalent in essence, and may be treated as a
single two-particle interference phenonmenon.

entrainment of van der Pol-type circadian pacemaker to daylight cycle. We
determine the amplitude and frequency of the circadian model without natural

results hardly depend on the stiffness coefficient, $ \mu $ of circadian
oscillations. It is shown that a practical and precise drive which imitates the
effects of the conditions of natural light can be introduced in the system and
analytically treated. Considering the effects of forcing light on the sleep
aware cycle model, we find that a strong drive destroys the circadian

the $c_T$-diminishing scenario for generating enhanced power spectrum of
primordial gravitational waves (GWs) during inflation, where $c_T$ is the
propagating speed of primordial GWs. Both of these two scenarios can be
realized stably with theories beyond Horndeski, hence can be uniformly
implemented within the framework of the effective field theory. We calculate
the power spectrum of primordial GWs by assuming that the inflationary Universe
undergoes three phases, where the violation of NEC or the diminishment of $c_T$
occurs in the intermediate phase. A template of the spectrum is given for the
NEC-violating scenario. We also discuss the underlying relation and discrepancy
between these two scenarios with a disformal transformation.

information processing. One way to generate these interactions is to utilize an
atom strongly coupled to an optical cavity. This system exhibits the photon
blockade effect which enables single photon switching and creation of
non-classical light. But the nonlinear effects enabled by this system suffer
from a fundamental time-bandwidth constraint. For the the simple case of
splitting an input pulse of two indistinguishable photons, this constraint
imposes a limit on the efficiency of routing photons to different output ports.
We show that this limit can be exceeded by combining the strongly-coupled atom
with linear optics. By optimizing the unitary of the linear optical
transformation, we achieve improved splitting efficiency for both un-entangled
and entangled photons. Our results suggest that it may be possible to improve
the efficiency of nonlinear optical processes at the single photon level by
making suitable use of linear optics. These results could have implications for
quantum information processing with photons.

large number of the model parameters via time-varying channels. Two types of
solutions based on digital and analog schemes are used typically. The
digital-based solution takes quantization and entropy coding for compression,
whereas transmissions via wireless channels may cause catastrophic errors owing
to the all-or-nothing behavior in entropy coding. The analog-based solutions
such as AirNet and AirComp use analog modulation for the parameter
transmissions. However, such an analog scheme often causes significant
distortion due to the source signal's large power without compression gain.
This paper proposes a novel hybrid digital-analog transmission-Federated
AirNet--for the model parameter transmissions in federated learning. The
Federated AirNet integrates low-rate digital coding and energy-compact analog
modulation. The digital coding offers the baseline of the model parameters and
compacts the source signal power. In addition, the residual parameters, which
are obtained from the original and encoded model parameters, are
analog-modulated to enhance the baseline according to the instantaneous
wireless channel quality. We show that the proposed Federated AirNet yields
better image classification accuracy compared with the digital-based and
analog-based solutions over a wide range of wireless channel signal-to-noise

to a desired target node. The idea is based on continuously monitoring the
position of the quantum walker on the graph and then to apply a unitary

feedback changes the couplings between the nodes and it is optimized at each
time via a numerical procedure. We numerically simulate the stochastic
trajectories describing the evolution for graphs of dimensions up to $N=15$,
and quantify the performance of the protocol via the average fidelity between
the state of the walker and the target node. We discuss different constraints
on the control strategy, in particular on the possible values that the feedback
couplings can take. We find that for unbounded controls, the protocol is able
to quickly localize the walker on the target node. We then discuss how the
performance is lowered by posing an upper bound on the control couplings, but
still allowing to stabilize the walker in the desired node. Finally, we show
how a digital feedback protocol, where the couplings can take values only from

characterized for use in an UHDR electron beam and demonstrated appropriateness
for UHDR FLASH radiotherapy dosimetry.
  Methods: Dose linearity, mean dose rate, and dose per pulse dependencies of
the EDGE Detector were quantified and compared with dosimeters including a W1
scintillator detector, radiochromic film, and ionization chamber that were
irradiated with a 10 MeV UHDR beam. The dose, dose rate and dose per pulse were
controlled via an in-house developed scintillation-based feedback mechanism,
repetition rate of the linear accelerator, and source-to-surface distance,
respectively. Depth-dose profiles and temporal profiles at individual pulse
resolution were compared to the film and scintillation measurements,
respectively. The radiation-induced change in response sensitivity was
quantified via irradiation of ~5kGy.
  Results: The EDGE Detector agreed with film measurements in the measured
range with varying dose (up to 70 Gy), dose rate (nearly 200 Gy/s), and dose
per pulse (up to 0.63 Gy/pulse) on average to within 2%, 5%, and 1%,
respectively. The detector also agreed with W1 scintillation detector on
average to within 2% for dose per pulse (up to 0.78 Gy/pulse). The EDGE
Detector signal was proportional to ion chamber (IC) measured dose, and mean
dose rate in the bremsstrahlung tail to within 0.4% and 0.2% respectively. The
EDGE Detector measured percent depth dose agreed with film to within 3% and per
pulse output agreed with W1 scintillator to within -6% to +5%.
  Conclusions: The EDGE Detector demonstrated dose linearity, mean dose rate
independence, and dose per pulse independence for UHDR electron beams. It can
quantify the beam spatially, and temporally at sub millisecond resolution.

without any doubt, the most widely used tools to describe Giant Resonances
within a microscopic theory. In this chapter, we will start by discussing how
RPA comes out naturally if one seeks a state with a harmonic time dependence in
the space of one particle-one hole excitations on top of the ground state. It
will be also shown that RPA is the simplest approach in which a ``collective''
state emerges. These are basic arguments that appear in other textbooks but are
also unavoidable as a starting point for further discussions. In the rest of
the chapter, we will give emphasis to developments that have taken place in the
last decades: alternatives to RPA like the Finite Amplitude Method (FAM),
state-of-the-art calculations with well-established Energy Density Functionals
(EDFs), and progress in {\em ab initio} calculations. We will discuss
extensions of RPA using as a red thread the various enlargements of the one
particle-one hole model space. The importance of the continuum, and the
exclusive observables like the decay products of Giant Resonances, will be also
touched upon.

  circadian pacemaker model driven by light",,"Brazilian Journal of Physics 2022",,,"physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Daylight plays a major role in the wake/sleep cycle in humans. Indeed, the
wake/sleep system stems from biological systems that follow a circadian rhythm
determined by the light/dark alternation. The oscillations can be modeled by
the higher order non-linearity van der Pol -type equation driven by a term that
mimics the light cycle. In this work noise in the illumination is introduced to
investigate its effect on the human circadian cycle. It is found that the
presence of noise is detrimental for the sleep/wake rhythm, except for some
special values for which it may favor regular oscillations. Depending for
system parameters, noise induces regularities, such as stochastic resonance: if
the natural light is turned off, it emerges that there is an optimal value of
intensity noise which most deteriorates the regularity of the cycle, it is the
phenomenon of anti-coherent resonance. Also, the phenomenon of stochastic
resonance occurs: in the presence of the drive of natural light, there is an
optimal noise intensity which improves the evolution of the wake / sleep
system. However, there is a critical value of the noise beyond which the system
becomes chaotic; indeed, for sufficiently high noise levels (how high depends
upon the parameter of the system), the sleep/wake cycle evolves in a random and
unpredictable manner, for whatever parameters of the external light.

requires large amount of annotated volumes. Annotations mandate expert
knowledge and are time-intensive to obtain through fully manual segmentation
methods. Additionally, lung lesions have large inter-patient variations, with
some pathologies having similar visual appearance as healthy lung tissues. This
poses a challenge when applying existing semi-automatic interactive
segmentation techniques for data labelling. To address these challenges, we
propose an efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be learned
online while the annotator provides scribble-based interaction. To accelerate
learning from only the samples labelled through user-interactions, a
patch-based approach is used for training the network. Moreover, we use
weighted cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance that may result from
user-interactions. During online inference, the learned network is applied to
the whole input volume using a fully convolutional approach. We compare our
proposed method with state-of-the-art using synthetic scribbles and show that
it outperforms existing methods on the task of annotating lung lesions
associated with COVID-19, achieving 16% higher Dice score while reducing
execution time by 3$\times$ and requiring 9000 lesser scribbles-based labelled

super-linear relationship between team size and productivity, thus contesting
the view of software economics that software projects are diseconomies of

Here, we present a detailed multi-frequency analysis of the nearby (z=0.01646)
galaxy group NGC 507. In particular, we present new high-sensitivity and high
spatial resolution radio images in the frequency range 144-675 MHz obtained
using LOFAR and uGMRT observations. These reveal the presence of previously
undetected diffuse radio emission with complex, filamentary morphology, likely
related to a previous outburst of the central galaxy. Based on spectral ageing
considerations, we derived that the plasma was first injected by the AGN
240-380 Myr ago and is now cooling. Our analysis of deep archival XMM-Newton
data confirms that the system is dynamically disturbed, as previously
suggested. We detect two discontinuities in the X-ray surface brightness
distribution (in East and South direction) tracing a spiral pattern, which we
interpret as cold fronts produced by sloshing motions. The remarkable spatial
coincidence observed between the newly-detected arc-like radio filament and the
southern concave X-ray discontinuity strongly suggests that the remnant plasma
has been displaced by the sloshing motions on large scales. Overall, NGC 507
represents one of the clearest examples known to date in which a direct
interaction between old AGN remnant plasma and the external medium is observed
in a galaxy group. Our results are consistent with simulations, which suggest
that filamentary emission can be created by the cluster/group weather
disrupting AGN lobes and spreading their relativistic content into the
surrounding medium.

intermediate phase as the predicted QSL. By measuring the magnetization data

refactoring vocabulary. Fowler's book describes the most popular catalog of
refactorings, which documents single and well-known refactoring operations.
However, sometimes refactorings are composite transformations, i.e., a sequence
of refactorings is performed over a given program element. For example, a
sequence of Extract Method operations (a single refactoring) can be performed
over the same method, in one or in multiple commits, to simplify its
implementation, therefore, leading to a Method Decomposition operation (a

eight composite refactorings. We also implement a set of scripts to mine
composite refactorings by preprocessing the results of refactoring detection
tools. Using such scripts, we search for composites in a representative
refactoring oracle with hundreds of confirmed single refactoring operations.
Next, to complement this first study, we also search for composites in the full

composite refactorings, under dimensions such as size and location. We conclude
by addressing the applications and implications of the proposed catalog.

integrating heterogeneous information to reveal the intrinsic clustering
structure hidden across views. Usually, MSC methods use graphs (or affinity
matrices) fusion to learn a common structure, and further apply graph-based
approaches to clustering. Despite progress, most of the methods do not
establish the connection between graph learning and clustering. Meanwhile,
conventional graph fusion strategies assign coarse-grained weights to combine
multi-graph, ignoring the importance of local structure. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained graph learning framework for multi-view subspace
clustering (FGL-MSC) to address these issues. To utilize the multi-view
information sufficiently, we design a specific graph learning method by
introducing graph regularization and local structure fusion pattern. The main
challenge is how to optimize the fine-grained fusion weights while generating
the learned graph that fits the clustering task, thus making the clustering
representation meaningful and competitive. Accordingly, an iterative algorithm
is proposed to solve the above joint optimization problem, which obtains the
learned graph, the clustering representation, and the fusion weights
simultaneously. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show that
the proposed framework has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
methods.

Recently, an unsupervised machine learning technique called VAMPNet was
introduced to learn the low dimensional representation and linear dynamical

Markov processes (VAMP) and relies on neural networks to learn the
coarse-grained dynamics. In this contribution, we combine VAMPNet and graph
neural networks to generate an end-to-end framework to efficiently learn
high-level dynamics and metastable states from the long-timescale molecular
dynamics trajectories. This method bears the advantages of graph representation
learning and uses graph message passing operations to generate an embedding for
each datapoint which is used in the VAMPNet to generate a coarse-grained
representation. This type of molecular representation results in a higher
resolution and more interpretable Markov model than the standard VAMPNet
enabling a more detailed kinetic study of the biomolecular processes. Our
GraphVAMPNet approach is also enhanced with an attention mechanism to find the
important residues for classification into different metastable states.

charge of making high-level driving decisions such as cruising and stopping,
and thus highly securitycritical. In this work, we perform the first systematic
study of semantic security vulnerabilities specific to overly-conservative AD
behavioral planning behaviors, i.e., those that can cause failed or
significantly-degraded mission performance, which can be critical for AD
services such as robo-taxi/delivery. We call them semantic Denial-of-Service
(DoS) vulnerabilities, which we envision to be most generally exposed in
practical AD systems due to the tendency for conservativeness to avoid safety
incidents. To achieve high practicality and realism, we assume that the
attacker can only introduce seemingly-benign external physical objects to the
driving environment, e.g., off-road dumped cardboard boxes.
  To systematically discover such vulnerabilities, we design PlanFuzz, a novel
dynamic testing approach that addresses various problem-specific design
challenges. Specifically, we propose and identify planning invariants as novel
testing oracles, and design new input generation to systematically enforce
problemspecific constraints for attacker-introduced physical objects. We also
design a novel behavioral planning vulnerability distance metric to effectively
guide the discovery. We evaluate PlanFuzz on 3 planning implementations from
practical open-source AD systems, and find that it can effectively discover 9
previouslyunknown semantic DoS vulnerabilities without false positives. We find
all our new designs necessary, as without each design, statistically
significant performance drops are generally observed. We further perform
exploitation case studies using simulation and real-vehicle traces. We discuss
root causes and potential fixes.

methods to learn a temporal redistribution of the episodic reward to obtain a

challenges: identifying (1) relative importance of states along the length of
an episode (along time), and (2) relative importance of individual agents'
states at any single time-step (among agents). In this paper, we introduce
Agent-Temporal Attention for Reward Redistribution in Episodic Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (AREL) to address these two challenges. AREL uses
attention mechanisms to characterize the influence of actions on state
transitions along trajectories (temporal attention), and how each agent is
affected by other agents at each time-step (agent attention). The redistributed
rewards predicted by AREL are dense, and can be integrated with any given MARL
algorithm. We evaluate AREL on challenging tasks from the Particle World
environment and the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge. AREL results in higher
rewards in Particle World, and improved win rates in StarCraft compared to
three state-of-the-art reward redistribution methods. Our code is available at

could still benefit from the fine-grained parallelism of this method. Using the
dual-quantization technique, we implement and optimize a SIMD vectorized CPU

fraction of constraints. Biased CSPs are versatile and express several well
studied problems such as Densest-$k$-Sub(Hyper)graph and SmallSetExpansion.
  In this work, we explore the role played by the bias parameter $\mu$ on the
approximability of biased CSPs. We show that the approximability of such CSPs
can be characterized (up to loss of factors of arity $r$) using the
bias-approximation curve of Densest-$k$-SubHypergraph (DkSH). In particular,
this gives a tight characterization of predicates which admit approximation
guarantees that are independent of the bias parameter $\mu$.
  Motivated by the above, we give new approximation and hardness results for
DkSH. In particular, assuming the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis (SSEH), we
show that DkSH with arity $r$ and $k = \mu n$ is NP-hard to approximate to a
factor of $\Omega(r^3\mu^{r-1}\log(1/\mu))$ for every $r \geq 2$ and $\mu <
2^{-r}$. We also give a $O(\mu^{r-1}\log(1/\mu))$-approximation algorithm for

when the arity $r$ is a constant, and in particular, imply the first tight
approximation bounds for the Densest-$k$-Subgraph problem in the linear bias
regime. Furthermore, using the above characterization, our results also imply
matching algorithms and hardness for every biased CSP of constant arity.

based on coincidental overlaps of the chirp mass, sky location, and coalescence
phase are approximately $9\%$, $1\%$, and $10\%$ per pair, respectively.
Combining all three, the overall FAP per pair is $\sim10^{-4}$. As the number
of events, $N$, in the GW catalogs increases, the number of random pairs of
events increases as $\sim N^2$. Meanwhile, the number of lensed events will
increase linearly with $N$, implying that for sufficiently high $N$, the false
alarms will always dominate over the true lensing events. This issue can be
compensated for by placing higher thresholds on the lensing candidates (e.g.,
selecting a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold), which will lead to
better parameter estimation and, thus, lower FAP per pair -- at the cost of
dramatically decreasing the size of the lensing sample (by $\sim
1/\mbox{SNR}^3$). We show that with our simple overlap criteria for current
detectors at design sensitivity, the false alarms will dominate for realistic
lensing rates ($\lesssim10^{-3}$) even when selecting the highest SNR pairs.
These results highlight the necessity to design alternative identification
criteria beyond simple waveform and sky location overlap. Future GW detectors
Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope may provide sufficient improvement in
parameter estimation, allowing for the conclusive detection of strong lensing
of GWs.

training data has missing annotations, i.e. sparsely annotated data.
Contemporary methods focus on proxies for missing ground-truth annotations
either in the form of pseudo-labels or by re-weighing gradients for unlabeled
boxes during training. In this work, we revisit the formulation of sparsely
annotated object detection. We observe that sparsely annotated object detection
can be considered a semi-supervised object detection problem at a region level.
Building on this insight, we propose a region-based semi-supervised algorithm,
that automatically identifies regions containing unlabeled foreground objects.
Our algorithm then processes the labeled and un-labeled foreground regions
differently, a common practice in semi-supervised methods. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct exhaustive experiments on
five splits commonly used by sparsely annotated approaches on the PASCAL-VOC
and COCO datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance. In addition to
this, we show that our approach achieves competitive performance on standard
semi-supervised setups demonstrating the strength and broad applicability of

optical transients (FBOTs) in star-forming galaxies comprise a new class of
transients, whose origin is yet to be understood. We show that hydrogen-rich
collapsing stars that launch relativistic jets near the central engine can
naturally explain the entire set of FBOT observables. The jet-star interaction
forms a mildly-relativistic shocked jet (inner cocoon) component, which powers
cooling emission that dominates the high velocity optical signal during the
first few weeks, with a typical energy of $ \sim 10^{50}-10^{51} $ erg. During
this time, the cocoon radial energy distribution implies that the optical
lightcurve exhibits a fast decay of $ L \propto t^{-2.4} $. After a few weeks,
when the velocity of the emitting shell is $ \sim 0.01 $ c, the cocoon becomes
transparent, and the cooling envelope governs the emission. The interaction
between the cocoon and the dense circumstellar winds generates synchrotron
self-absorbed emission in the radio bands, featuring a steady rise on a month
timescale. After a few months the relativistic outflow decelerates, enters the
observer's line of sight, and powers the peak of the radio lightcurve, which
rapidly decays thereafter. The jet (and the inner cocoon) become optically thin
to X-rays $ \sim $ day after the collapse, allowing X-ray photons to diffuse
from the central engine that launched the jet to the observer. Cocoon cooling
emission is expected at higher volumetric rates than gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by
a factor of a few, similar to FBOTs. We rule out uncollimated outflows, however
both GRB jets and failed collimated jets are compatible with all observables.

validity of our model's fundamental assumptions that the spiral inhabits a
locally static and vertically separable gravitational potential. These
assumptions might be compromised in the complex kinematic system of a disturbed
three-dimensional disk galaxy; in fact, the statistical uncertainty and any
potential biases related to these assumptions are expected to be amplified for
this simulation, which differs from the Milky Way in that it is more strongly
perturbed and has a phase-space spiral that inhabits higher vertical energies.
We constructed 44 separate data samples from different spatial locations in the

gravitational potential of these 44 data samples, with an unbiased distribution
of errors with a standard deviation of 7 %. We also tested our method under
severe and unknown spatially dependent selection effects, also with robust
results; this sets it apart from traditional dynamical mass measurements that
are based on the assumption of a steady state and which are highly sensitive to
unknown or poorly modelled incompleteness. Hence, we will be able to make
localised mass measurements of distant regions in the Milky Way disk, which

generally causes the rapid flavor violating decays, such as $K_L \to \mu e$, at

demonstration, and find that the vector-like fermion masses have an upper bound

misclassified objects usually do not fall on the bright end of the luminosity
function, and only in three cases does the distance change by more than
$1\sigma$. We find generally good agreement with literature values from other

consistent with random at all separations, despite subhaloes exhibiting
preferential parallel minor axis alignment. The weaker IA of star-forming gas
than for stars stems from the former's tendency to be less well aligned with
the dark matter structure of galaxies than the latter, and implies that the
systematic uncertainty due to IA may be less severe in radio continuum weak
lensing surveys than in optical counterparts. Alignment models equating the
orientation of star-forming gas discs to that of stellar discs or the DM
structure of host subhaloes will therefore overestimate the impact of IAs on
radio continuum cosmic shear measurements.

a subgroup of objects characterized by the B[e] phenomenon. The split of
magnetically sensitive lines in IRAS 17449+2320 determines the magnetic field
modulus of 6.2+/-0.2 kG. Spectral lines and their variability reveal the
presence of a B-type spectrum and a hot continuum source in the visible. The
hot source confirms GALEX UV photometry. Because there is a lack of spectral
lines for the hot source in the visible, the spectral fitting gives only the
lower temperature limit of the hot source, which is 50 000 K, and the upper
limit for the B-type star of 11 100 K. The V/R ratio of the H alpha line shows
quasiperiodic behavior on timescale of 800 days. We detected a strong
red-shifted absorption in the wings of Balmer and OI lines in some of the
spectra. The absorption lines of helium and other metals show no, or very
small, variations, indicating unusually stable photospheric regions for FS CMa
stars. We detected two events of material infall, which were revealed to be
discrete absorption components of resonance lines.
  The discovery of the strong magnetic field together with the Gaia
measurements of the proper motion show that the most probable nature of this
star is that of a post-merger object created after the leaving the binary of
the birth cluster. Another possible scenario is a magnetic Ap star around
Terminal-Age Main Sequence (TAMS). On the other hand, the strong magnetic field
defies the hypothesis that IRAS 17449+2320 is an extreme classical Be star.
Thus, IRAS 17449+2320 provides a pretext for exploring a new explanation of the
nature of FS CMa stars or, at least, a group of stars with very similar
spectral properties.

detect three outbursts from Class 0 protostars with $\ge 2$ mag changes at 3.6
or 4.5 $\mu$m. This is comparable to the magnitude change of a known
protostellar FU Ori outburst. Two are newly detected bursts from the protostars
HOPS 12 and 124. The number of detections implies that Class 0 protostars burst
every 438 yr, with a 95% confidence interval of 161 to 1884 yr. Combining
Spitzer and WISE/NEOWISE data spanning 2004-2019, we show that the bursts
persist for more than nine years with significant variability during each
burst. Finally, we use $19-100$ $\mu$m photometry from SOFIA, Spitzer and
Herschel to measure the amplitudes of the bursts. Based on the burst interval,
a duration of 15 yr, and the range of observed amplitudes, 3-100% of the mass
accretion during the Class 0 phase occurs during bursts. In total, we show that
bursts from Class 0 protostars are as frequent, or even more frequent, than
those from more evolved protostars. This is consistent with bursts being driven
by instabilities in disks triggered by rapid mass infall. Furthermore, we find
that bursts may be a significant, if not dominant, mode of mass accretion
during the Class 0 phase.

Considering the good results obtained with Deep RL approaches in different
areas there is a growing interest in applying them in problems from the

Policy Optimization (PPO2), to solve the problem considering uncertain, regular
and seasonal demands and constant or stochastic lead times. Experiments are
carried out in different scenarios to better assess the suitability of the
algorithm. An agent based on a linearized model is used as a baseline.
Experimental results indicate that PPO2 is a competitive and adequate tool for
this type of problem. PPO2 agent is better than baseline in all scenarios with
stochastic lead times (7.3-11.2%), regardless of whether demands are seasonal
or not. In scenarios with constant lead times, the PPO2 agent is better when
uncertain demands are non-seasonal (2.2-4.7%). The results show that the
greater the uncertainty of the scenario, the greater the viability of this type
of approach.

Similarly to two-dimensional systems, we find that the connected
particle-particle correlation function decays roughly exponentially with the
distance between the lattice sites measured in the two-dimensional plane, but
the values also depend on the local environment. Contrary to two-dimensional
systems, we find that the entanglement entropy does not follow the area law if
one defines the area to be the number of nearest neighbor bonds that cross the
edge of the selected subsystem. Considering bipartitions with two bonds
crossing the edge, we find a close to logarithmic scaling of the entanglement
entropy with the number of sites in the subsystem. This also means that the
topological entanglement entropy cannot be extracted using the Kitaev-Preskill
or the Levin-Wen methods. Studying the entanglement spectrum for different
bipartitions, we find that the number of states below the entanglement gap is
robust and the same as for Laughlin states on two-dimensional lattices.

about a reduced set of candidate beams for the links between the
road-infrastructure and each one of the vehicles. This prior information can be
later leveraged by the beam training protocol to significantly reduce overhead.
The radar processing chain estimates both the timing and chirp rates of the
radar signals, isolates the individual signals by filtering out interfering
radar chirps, and estimates the spatial covariance of each individual radar
transmission. Then, a deep network is used to translate features of these radar
spatial covariances into features of the communication spatial covariances, by
learning the intricate mapping between radar and communication channels, in
both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight settings. The communication rates and

self-energy has a singularity. From a technical point of view, that feature is
indicative that the self-energy acquires an imaginary part, which is associated
with damping effects and cannot be neglected, while the integral formula for
the real part must be evaluated using the principal value of the integral. We
carry out the calculations explicitly for some cases that allow us to give
analytic results. Writing the dispersion relation in the form $\omega = \kappa

$V_{\text{eff}}$ and $\gamma$ for the cases considered. When the neutrino
energy is either much larger or much smaller than the resonance energy,
$V_{\text{eff}}$ reduces to the effective potential that has been already
determined in the literature in the high or low momentum regime, respectively.
The virtue of the formula we give for $V_{\text{eff}}$ is that it is valid also
in the \emph{resonance energy range}, which is outside the two limits
mentioned. As a guide to possible applications we give the relevant formulas

multiple papers spanning several decades. The most prominent problem in this
line of work has been to bound the query complexity of computing an envy-free
outcome in the Robertson-Webb query model. However, the root of this problem's
complexity is somewhat artificial: the agents' values are assumed to be
additive across different pieces of the ""cake"" but infinitely complicated
within each piece. This is unrealistic in most of the motivating examples,
where the cake represents a finite collection of homogeneous goods.
  We address this issue by introducing a fair division model that more
accurately captures these applications: the value that an agent gains from a
given good depends only on the amount of the good they receive, yet it can be
an arbitrary function of this amount, allowing the agents to express
preferences that go beyond standard cake cutting. In this model, we study the
query complexity of computing allocations that are not just envy-free, but also
approximately Pareto optimal among all envy-free allocations. Using a novel
flow-based approach, we show that we can encode the ex-post feasibility of
randomized allocations via a polynomial number of constraints, which reduces
our problem to solving a linear program.

platforms for quantum simulation and quantum information processing. However,
as is the case for other experimental platforms, the longer-term success of the
Rydberg atom arrays in implementing quantum algorithms depends crucially on
their robustness to gate-induced errors. Here we show that, for an idealized
biased error model based on Rydberg atom dynamics, the implementation of QSP
protocols can be made error-robust, in the sense that the asymptotic scaling of
the gate-induced error probability is slower than that of gate complexity.
Moreover, using experimental parameters reported in the literature, we show
that QSP iterates made out of up to a hundred gates can be implemented with
constant error probability. To showcase our approach, we provide a concrete
blueprint to implement QSP-based near-optimal Hamiltonian simulation on the

the overhead of gate-induced errors in comparison to those protocols that
implement a fourth-order product-formula.

continuum-faint (-23<M_UV<-14) lensed Lyman-alpha emitters (producing 959
images) with spectroscopic redshifts between 2.9 and 6.7. Combining the power
of cluster magnification with 3D spectroscopic observations, we are able to
reveal the resolved morphological properties of 268 Lyman-alpha emitters. We
use a forward modelling approach to model both Lyman-alpha and rest-frame UV
continuum emission profiles in the source plane and measure spatial extent,
ellipticity and spatial offsets between UV and Lyman-alpha emission. We find a
significant correlation between UV continuum and Lyman-alpha spatial extent.
Our characterization of the Lyman-alpha haloes indicates that the halo size is
linked to the physical properties of the host galaxy (SFR, Lyman-alpha EW and
Lyman-alpha line FWHM). We find that 48% of Lyman-alpha haloes are best-fitted
by an elliptical emission distribution with a median axis ratio of q=0.48. We
observe that 60% of galaxies detected both in UV and Lyman-alpha emission show
a significant spatial offset (Delta). We measure a median offset of Delta= 0.58
\pm 0.14 kpc for the entire sample. By comparing the spatial offset values with
the size of the UV component, we show that 40% of the offsets could be due to
star-forming sub-structures in the UV component, while the larger offsets are
more likely due to larger distance processes such as scattering effects inside
the circumgalactic medium or emission from faint satellites or merging
galaxies. Comparisons with a zoom-in radiative hydrodynamics simulation of a
typical Lyman-alpha emitting galaxy show a good agreement with LLAMAS galaxies
and indicate that bright star-formation clumps and satellite galaxies could
produce a similar spatial offsets distribution. (abridged)

research have been mainly driven by 3D convolutional neural networks and vision
transformers. Although 3D convolution can efficiently aggregate local context
to suppress local redundancy from a small 3D neighborhood, it lacks the
capability to capture global dependency because of the limited receptive field.
Alternatively, vision transformers can effectively capture long-range
dependency by self-attention mechanism, while having the limitation on reducing
local redundancy with blind similarity comparison among all the tokens in each
layer. Based on these observations, we propose a novel Unified transFormer
(UniFormer) which seamlessly integrates merits of 3D convolution and
spatiotemporal self-attention in a concise transformer format, and achieves a

$^{127}$Xe electron capture source. nEXO is a next-generation search for
neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) that will use a 5-tonne,
monolithic liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC). The xenon, used both as
source and detection medium, will be enriched to 90% in $^{136}$Xe. To optimize
the event reconstruction and energy resolution, calibrations are needed to map
the position- and time-dependent detector response. The 36.3 day half-life of
$^{127}$Xe and its small $Q$-value compared to that of $^{136}$Xe
$0\nu\beta\beta$ would allow a small activity to be maintained continuously in
the detector during normal operations without introducing additional
backgrounds, thereby enabling in-situ calibration and monitoring of the
detector response. In this work we describe a process for producing the source
and preliminary experimental tests. We then use simulations to project the
precision with which such a source could calibrate spatial corrections to the
light and charge response of the nEXO TPC.

investigate the interactions between terahertz excitations in a structure
composed of Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ and GaAs materials. We find that the interaction
between the Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ layer and AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells with
intersubband transitions (ISBTs) in the terahertz frequency regime creates new
hybrid modes, namely Dirac plasmon-phonon-ISBT polaritons. The formation of
these hybrid modes results in anti-crossings (spectral mode splitting) whose
magnitude is an indication of the strength of the coupling. By varying the
structural parameters of the constituent materials, our numerical calculations
reveal that the magnitude of splitting depends strongly on the doping level and
the scattering rate in the AlGaAs/GaAs quantum wells, as well as on the
thickness of the GaAs spacer layer that separates the quantum-well structure
from the TI layer. Our results reveal the material and device parameters
required to obtain experimentally-observable signatures of strong coupling. Our
model includes the contribution of an extra two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG)
that is predicted to arise at the Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$/GaAs interface, based on
density functional theory (DFT) calculations that explicitly account for
details of the atomic terminations at the interface. The presence of this
massive 2DHG at the TI/III-V interface shifts the dispersion of the Dirac
plasmon-ISBT polaritons to higher frequencies. The damping rate at this
interface, in contrast, compensates the effect of the 2DHG. Finally, we observe
that the phonon resonances in the TI layer are crucial to the coupling between
the THz excitations in the TI and III-V materials.

that appears in the literature with two conflicting redshift values: $\sim 1.2$

fitting of the narrow absorption lines in its ultraviolet (UV) spectrum. This
source is also known historically as a luminous infrared galaxy. We present
optical spectra of HE 0435-5304, aiming to precisely measure its redshift and
to study its physical properties. In particular, properties of its active
nucleus, which is studied in the context of the source being identified here as
an ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, allow us to place this quasar in the context
of the general population. Fitting the spectra, we focused on modeling H$\beta$
and [O III] lines. Based on these, we derived the virial black hole mass,
bolometric luminosity, and Eddington ratio of the active galactic nucleus
(AGN). Additionally, we performed broad band photometry fitting which allows us
to quantify host galaxy parameters. The improved redshift value of HE 0435-5304
is estimated to $0.42788 \pm 0.00027$ based on the [O II] line, which is mostly
consistent with the narrowest components of the other emission lines. The
source was found to be a relatively massive and luminous AGN whose host galaxy
is actively forming stars. Although its stellar population seems to be heavily
obscured, we did not find evidence for significant obscuration of the nucleus.
We conclude that the AGN HE 0435-5304 is a rather prominent iron emitter from
the extreme type-A population very close to the narrow-line Seyfert 1 group.
The fact that the width of the H$\beta$ line appears to be systematically
growing in its broadest component with time may suggest that this AGN is
changing its broad line region. Due to the influence of atmospheric effects,
this finding is uncertain.

amounts of presolar chromium-rich oxide (chromite) grains, which exist within
the meteoritic stardust inventory and most likely originated from some type of
supernova explosions. To investigate if core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) could
be the site of origin of these grains, we analyse yields of CCSN models of
stars with initial mass 15, 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$, and solar metallicity. We
present an extensive abundance data set of the Cr, Mg, and Al isotopes as a
function of enclosed mass. We find cases in which the explosive C-ashes produce
a composition in good agreement with the observed \iso{54}Cr/\iso{52}Cr and
\iso{53}Cr/\iso{52}Cr ratios as well as the \iso{50}Cr/\iso{52}Cr ratios.
Taking into account that the signal at atomic mass 50 could also originate from

Addition of material from the He ashes (enriched in Al and Cr relative to Mg to
simulate the make-up of chromite grains) to the Solar System composition may
reproduce the observed correlation between Mg and Cr anomalies, while material
from the C-ashes does not present significant Mg anomalies together with Cr
isotopic variations. In all cases, non-radiogenic, stable Mg isotope variations
dominate over the variations expected from \iso{26}Al.

the diffusion of particles along and across the magnetic field lines. This
process is described by the quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) that leads to the
increase of pitch angles and generation of the synchrotron emission. We study
the kinetic equation which defines the distribution of emitting particles. The
redistribution is conditioned by two major factors, QLD and the dissipation
process, that is caused by synchrotron reaction force. The QLD increases pitch
angles, whereas the synchrotron force resists this process. The balance between
these two forces guarantees the maintenance of the pitch angles and the
corresponding synchrotron emission process. The model is analyzed for a wide
range of physical parameters and it is shown that the mechanism of QLD provides
the generation of high energy (HE) emission in the GeV energy domain. According
to the model the lower energy, associated with the cyclotron modes, provokes
the synchrotron radiation in the higher energy band.

pandemic (e.g., COVID-19) is to shut down international airports. From a
network theory perspective, this is since international airports and flights,
essentially playing the roles of bridge nodes and bridge links between
countries as individual communities, dominate the epidemic spreading
characteristics in the whole multi-community system. Among all epidemic
characteristics, the peak fraction of infected, $I_{\max}$, is a decisive
factor in evaluating an epidemic strategy given limited capacity of medical
resources, but is seldom considered in multi-community models. In this paper,
we study a general two-community system interconnected by a fraction $r$ of
bridge nodes and its dynamic properties, especially $I_{\max}$, under the
evolution of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. Comparing the
characteristic time scales of different parts of the system allows us to
analytically derive the asymptotic behavior of $I_{\max}$ with $r$, as
$r\rightarrow 0$, which follows different power-law relations in each regime of
the phase diagram. We also detect crossovers when $I_{\max}$ changes from one
power law to another, crossing different power-law regimes as driven by $r$.
Our results enable a better prediction of the effectiveness of strategies
acting on bridge nodes, denoted by the power-law exponent $\epsilon_I$ as in
$I_{\max}\propto r^{1/\epsilon_I}$.

  choice of modelling resolution using a CutFEM level-set approach",,,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a robust and efficient unfitted concurrent
multiscale method for continuum-continuum coupling, based on the Cut Finite
Element Method (CutFEM). The computational domain is defined using approximate
signed distance functions over a fixed background mesh and is decomposed into
microscale and macroscale regions using a novel zooming technique. The zoom
interface is represented by a signed distance function intersecting the
computational mesh arbitrarily. The mesh inside the zoomed region is
hierarchically refined to resolve the microstructure. In the examples
considered, the microstructure may contain voids and hard inclusions, and its
geometry is defined implicitly by a signed distance function interpolated over
the refined mesh.
  Our zooming technique allows the zoom interface to intersect the
microstructure interface in an arbitrary fashion, enabling greater flexibility
and accuracy in the modelling of complex geometries. The micro and macro
regions are coupled using Nitsche's method, ensuring stability and accuracy in
the solution. Ghost penalty terms are utilised to ensure the stability of cut
elements along the zoom interface and the microstructure interface.
  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply it for modelling
several heterogeneous structures with both linear elasticity and plasticity
constitutive behaviours. The results show that our framework is robust and
efficient, producing accurate and reliable solutions for such problems. Our
proposed method provides a highly versatile and effective approach to
multiscale modeling of structures with complex microstructures, and has the
potential to be extended to problems requiring seamless moving of zooming
region(s) during the simulation, such as damage growth and fracture
propagation.

particle production and compared to the usual decay process in a model quantum

infrared singularities while seemingly different phenomena are qualitatively
related. We implement a non-perturbative dynamical resummation method to study
the time evolution of an initial state. It is manifestly unitary and yields the
asymptotic state and the distribution function of produced particles. Whereas
the survival probability in a decay process falls off as $e^{-\Gamma t}$, for
threshold and infrared divergent cases falls off instead as $e^{-\sqrt{t/t^*}}$
and $t^{-\Delta}$ respectively, with $\Gamma, \Delta \propto (coupling)^2$

asymptotic state is qualitatively similar: a kinematically entangled state of
the daughter particles with a distribution function which fulfills the
unitarity condition and is strongly peaked at energy conserving transitions but
broadened by the ""lifetime"" $1/\Gamma~;~ t^*$ for usual decay and threshold
singularity, whereas it scales with the anomalous dimension $\Delta$ for the
infrared singular case. Threshold and infrared instabilities are production
mechanisms just as efficient as particle decay. If one of the particles is in a
dark sector and not observed, the loss of information yields an entanglement
entropy determined by the distribution functions and increases upon unitary
time evolution.

spectrum of wall pressure fluctuations. To develop a predictive model of the
wavenumber-frequency spectrum from the wavenumber spectrum, the time
decorrelation mechanisms of wall pressure fluctuations are investigated. It is
discovered that the energy-containing part of the wavenumber-frequency spectrum
of wall pressure fluctuations can be well predicted using a similar random
sweeping model for streamwise velocity fluctuations. To refine the
investigation, we further decompose the spectrum of the total wall pressure
fluctuations into the auto spectra of rapid and slow pressure fluctuations, and
the cross spectrum between them. We focus on evaluating the assumption applied
in many predictive models, that is, the magnitude of the cross spectrum is
negligibly small. The present DNS shows that neglecting the cross spectrum
causes a maximum error up to 4.7dB in the sub-convective region for all
Reynolds numbers under test. Our analyses indicate that the assumption of
neglecting the cross spectrum needs to be applied carefully in the
investigations of acoustics at low Mach numbers, in which the sub-convective
components of wall pressure fluctuations make important contributions to the
radiated acoustic power.

display variability across the L2--T4 spectral type range. In contrast, the
field dwarf variability occurrence rate drops for spectral types $>$L9. We
examine the variability amplitudes of young objects and find an enhancement in
maximum amplitudes compared to field dwarfs. We speculate that the observed
range of amplitudes within a spectral type may be influenced by secondary
effects such as viewing inclination and/or rotation period. We combine our new
rotation periods with the literature to investigate the effects of mass on
angular momentum evolution. While high mass brown dwarfs ($>30
M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$) spin up over time, the same trend is not apparent for lower
mass objects ($<30 M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$), likely due to the small number of
measured periods for old, low-mass objects. The rotation periods of companion
brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects are consistent with those of isolated
objects with similar ages and masses, suggesting similar angular momentum
histories. Within the AB Doradus group, we find a high variability occurrence

queries to a search engine user to help in query formulation process and to
expedite information retrieval with minimum amount of effort. It is highly
useful in situations where the search requirements are not well understood and
hence it has been widely adopted by search engines to guide users' search
activity. For news websites, user queries have a time sensitive nature inherent
in them. When some new event happens, there is a sudden burst in queries
related to that event and such queries are sustained over a period of time
before fading away with that event. In addition to this temporal aspect of
search queries fired at news websites, they have an addition distinct quality,
i.e., they are intended to get event related information majority of the times.
Existing work on generating query suggestions involves analyzing query logs to
suggest queries which are relevant and related to the search intent of the
user. But in case of news websites, when there is a sudden burst in information
related to a particular event, there are not enough search queries fired by
other users which leads to lack of click data, and hence giving query
suggestions related to some old event or even some irrelevant suggestions
altogether. Another problem with query logs in the context of online news is
that, they mostly contain queries related to popular events and hence fail to
capture less popular events or events which got overshadowed by some other more
sensational event. We propose a novel approach to generate event-centric query
suggestions using metadata of news articles published by news media. We

number of communities to increase with the network size $n$ are only valid when
the average degree $d$ of a network grows at least as fast as $O(n)$ (i.e., the
dense case) or lies within a narrow range. This presents a challenge in
clustering large-scale network data, particularly when the average degree $d$
of a network grows slower than the rate of $O(n)$ (i.e., the sparse case). To
address this problem, we proposed a new sequential procedure utilizing multiple
hypothesis tests and the spectral properties of Erd\""{o}s R\'{e}nyi graphs for
estimating the number of communities in sparse stochastic block models (SBMs).
We prove the consistency of our method for sparse SBMs for a broad range of the

each patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local
representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set
of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information
from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing
feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained
independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronization
during distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale
industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and
may be stored in a distributed manner. We apply local2global on data sets of
different sizes and show that our approach achieves a good trade-off between
scale and accuracy on edge reconstruction and semi-supervised classification.

new opportunity for developing spintronics with superior speed and high device

complicated interactions from different sublattices. Meanwhile, because of the
diminishing magnetic susceptibility, the nature and the magnitude of
current-induced magnetic dynamics remain poorly characterized in
antiferromagnets, whereas spurious effects further complicate experimental
interpretations. In this work, by growing a thin film antiferromagnetic
insulator, {\alpha}-Fe2O3, along its non-basal plane orientation, we realize a
configuration where an injected spin current can robustly rotate the N\'eel
vector within the tilted easy plane, with an efficiency comparable to that of
classical ferromagnets. The spin-orbit torque effect stands out among other
competing mechanisms and leads to clear switching dynamics. Thanks to this new
mechanism, in contrast to the usually employed orthogonal switching geometry,
we achieve bipolar antiferromagnetic switching by applying positive and
negative currents along the same channel, a geometry that is more practical for
device applications. By enabling efficient spin-orbit torque control on the
antiferromagnetic ordering, the tilted easy plane geometry introduces a new

methods are successful in defending against gradient-based attacks; however,
they are easily circumvented by attacks which either do not use the gradient or
by attacks which approximate and use the corrected gradient. Defenses that do
not obfuscate gradients such as adversarial training exist, but these
approaches generally make assumptions about the attack such as its magnitude.
We propose a classification model that does not obfuscate gradients and is
robust by construction without assuming prior knowledge about the attack. Our
method casts classification as an optimization problem where we ""invert"" a
conditional generator trained on unperturbed, natural images to find the class
that generates the closest sample to the query image. We hypothesize that a
potential source of brittleness against adversarial attacks is the
high-to-low-dimensional nature of feed-forward classifiers which allows an
adversary to find small perturbations in the input space that lead to large
changes in the output space. On the other hand, a generative model is typically
a low-to-high-dimensional mapping. While the method is related to Defense-GAN,
the use of a conditional generative model and inversion in our model instead of
the feed-forward classifier is a critical difference. Unlike Defense-GAN, which
was shown to generate obfuscated gradients that are easily circumvented, we
show that our method does not obfuscate gradients. We demonstrate that our
model is extremely robust against black-box attacks and has improved robustness
against white-box attacks compared to naturally trained, feed-forward

general model in reinforcement learning that take into account the agent's
uncertainty about its current state. In the literature on POMDPs, it is
customary to assume access to a planning oracle that computes an optimal policy
when the parameters are known, even though the problem is known to be
computationally hard. Almost all existing planning algorithms either run in
exponential time, lack provable performance guarantees, or require placing
strong assumptions on the transition dynamics under every possible policy. In
this work, we revisit the planning problem and ask: are there natural and
well-motivated assumptions that make planning easy?
  Our main result is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for planning in
(one-step) observable POMDPs. Specifically, we assume that well-separated
distributions on states lead to well-separated distributions on observations,
and thus the observations are at least somewhat informative in each step.
Crucially, this assumption places no restrictions on the transition dynamics of
the POMDP; nevertheless, it implies that near-optimal policies admit
quasi-succinct descriptions, which is not true in general (under standard
hardness assumptions). Our analysis is based on new quantitative bounds for
filter stability -- i.e. the rate at which an optimal filter for the latent
state forgets its initialization. Furthermore, we prove matching hardness for
planning in observable POMDPs under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.

different liabilities towards novel vulnerabilities at different development

The proofs use the concept of ""Damped Deviations"", where deviations of the NTK

Galactic classical Cepheids are presented. By correlating the calculated period
change rates with the Gaia EDR3 colours, we obtain observational indications
for the non-negligible dependence of the period change rate on the horizontal
position within the instability strip. We find period fluctuations in 59
Cepheids with a confidence level of 99%, which are distributed uniformly over
the inspected period range. Correlating the fluctuation amplitude with the
pulsation period yields a clear dependence, similar to the one valid for longer
period pulsating variable stars. The non-negligible amount of Cepheids showing
changes in their $O-C$ diagrams that are not or not only of evolutionary origin
points toward the need for further studies for the complete understanding of
these effects. One such peculiar behaviour is the large amplitude period
fluctuation in short period Cepheids, which occurs in a significant fraction of
the investigated stars. The period dependence of the fluctuation strength and
its minimum at the bump Cepheid region suggests a stability enhancing mechanism
for this period range, which agrees with current pulsation models.

opportunities for exotic quantum phases to emerge in condensed matter systems.
Weyl fermions, in particular, provide an ideal platform for exploring the
dynamical instabilities of single-particle physics under interactions. Despite
its fundamental role in relativistic field theory, the concept of causality and
the associated spacetime light cone and event horizon has not been considered
in connection with interacting Weyl fermionic excitations in quantum matter.
Here, by using charge-density wave (CDW) as an example, we unveil the behavior
of interacting Weyl fermions and show that a Weyl fermion in a system can open
a band gap by interacting only with other Weyl fermions that lie within its
energy-momentum dispersion cone. In this sense, causal connections or
interactions are only possible within overlapping dispersion cones and each
dispersion cone thus constitutes a solid-state analogue of the more
conventional `event horizon' of high-energy physics. Our study provides a
universal framework for considering interacting relativistic quasiparticles in
condensed matter by separating them into energy-like and momentum-like
relationships in analogy with the time-like and space-like events in
high-energy physics. Finally, we consider two different candidate materials for
hosting the Weyl CDW phase: (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I and Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. Our study
greatly enriches the phenomenology and unveils new connections between
condensed matter and high-energy physics.

the wave operators $W_\pm=W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ associated with the fourth-order
Schr\""odinger operators $H=\Delta^{2}+V(x)$ on the line $\mathbb{R}$. Under a
suitable decay condition on $V$ and the absence of embedded eigenvalues of $H$,
we first prove that the wave and dual wave operators are bounded on
$L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for all $1<p<\infty$: $$ \|W_\pm
f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}+\|W_\pm^* f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}\lesssim
\|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}. $$ This result is further extended to the weighted
$L^p$-boundedness with the sharp $A_p$-bounds for general even $A_p$-weights
and to the boundedness on the Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$. For the
limiting case $p=1$, we also obtain several weak-type boundedness, including
$W_\pm\in \mathbb B(L^1,L^{1,\infty})\cap \mathbb B(\mathcal{H}^1,L^1)$ and
$W_\pm^*\in \mathbb B(L^1,L^{1,\infty})\cap \mathbb B(L^\infty, \mathrm{BMO})$.
These results especially hold whatever the zero energy is a regular point or a
resonance. Next, for the case that zero is a regular point, we prove that the
wave operators are neither bounded on $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ nor on
$L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, and they are even not bounded from
$L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ to $\mathrm{BMO}(\mathbb{R})$ if in addition $V$ is
compactly supported. In particular, these results give a complete picture of
the validity of $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators for all $1\le p\le
\infty$ in the regular case. Finally, as applications, we can deduce the
$L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates for the propagator $e^{-itH}P_{\mathrm{ac}}(H)$
with pairs $(1/p,1/q)$ belonging to certain region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, as well
as the H\""ormander-type $L^p$-boundedness theorem for the spectral multiplier

useful for understanding trends within a given population, but also pose a

Producing a private version of a time-series satisfying the standard definition
of Differential Privacy (DP) is challenging due to the large influence a single
participant can have on the sequence: if an individual can contribute to each
time step, the amount of additive noise needed to satisfy privacy increases
linearly with the number of time steps sampled. As such, if a signal spans a
long duration or is oversampled, an excessive amount of noise must be added,
drowning out underlying trends. However, in many applications an individual
realistically cannot participate at every time step. When this is the case, we
observe that the influence of a single participant (sensitivity) can be reduced
by subsampling and/or filtering in time, while still meeting privacy
requirements. Using a novel analysis, we show this significant reduction in
sensitivity and propose a corresponding class of privacy mechanisms. We
demonstrate the utility benefits of these techniques empirically with
real-world and synthetic time-series data.

detectable RPS signatures the presence of an Intra-cluster medium
(ICM)/intra-group medium (IGM) with sufficient density to produce RPS at a
realistic velocity relative to the ICM/IGM is a prerequisite. However,
XMM-Newton observations were not able to detect X-ray emission from the

less than 2.6 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^{-3}$. Higher-resolution VLA HI data
presented here show FGC 1287's HI disk is truncated and significantly warped
whereas the HI tail is clumpy. TNG H$\alpha$ imaging identified three star
forming clumps projected within 20 kpc of FGC 1287's disk, with VIMOS-IFU data
confirming two of these are counterparts to HI clumps in the tail. The
triplet's HI kinematics, together with H$\alpha$ and radio continuum imaging
suggests an interaction may have enhanced star formation in FGC 1287's disk,

commonly-used data sampling schemes can have significant consequences on
algorithm performance. Following this observation, this paper makes three main
contributions: (1) characterizing the effect of sampling on algorithm
performance, in terms of algorithm and dataset characteristics (e.g. sparsity
characteristics, sequential dynamics, etc.); (2) designing SVP-CF, which is a
data-specific sampling strategy, that aims to preserve the relative performance

practitioners to quickly prototype and compare various approaches, while
remaining confident that algorithm performance will be preserved, once the

prognosis of gastrointestinal cancer. In clinical practice, a universal MSI
testing is recommended, but the accessibility of such a test is limited. Thus,
a more cost-efficient and broadly accessible tool is desired to cover the
traditionally untested patients. In the past few years, deep-learning-based
algorithms have been proposed to predict MSI directly from haematoxylin and
eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs). Such algorithms can be
summarized as (1) patch-level MSI/MSS prediction, and (2) patient-level
aggregation. Compared with the advanced deep learning approaches that have been
employed for the first stage, only the na\""ive first-order statistics (e.g.,
averaging and counting) were employed in the second stage. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet broadly generalizable patient-level MSI aggregation (MAg)

the entire probabilistic distribution in the first stage is modeled as
histogram-based features to be fused as the final outcome with machine learning
(e.g., SVM). The proposed MAg method can be easily used in a plug-and-play
manner, which has been evaluated upon five broadly used deep neural networks:
ResNet, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, Dpn and ResNext. From the results, the
proposed MAg method consistently improves the accuracy of patient-level

success in India where we efficiently generated 10,000 new field labels. Our
best model uses 1.5m resolution Airbus SPOT imagery as input, pre-trains a

India labels to achieve a median Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.86 in
India. If using 4.8m resolution PlanetScope imagery instead, the best model
achieves a median IoU of 0.72. Experiments also show that pre-training in
France reduces the number of India field labels needed to achieve a given

findings suggest our method is a scalable approach for delineating crop fields
in regions of the world that currently lack field boundary datasets. We

the information exchange between customers through (electronic) word-of-mouth

customers' purchase decisions creating an endogenous demand structure. Service
providers can monitor how their service is perceived by consumers through
different methods, for example surveys. Although this requires an additional
effort, the understanding and integration of endogenous demand into operational
decisions offer great benefits. In this paper, we study a service system where
customers are sensitive to the on-demand access to the service. Customers form
a perception based on the information obtained by WoM communication and the
advertisement. Depending on the type of the service environment, service
capacity can be flexible or constant. We consider two types of service
providers: aware firm that has complete information on endogenous demand
structure, and na\""ive firm that has partial information. Our focus is to
understand the optimal advertisement and capacity decisions, and the value of
information on the underlying demand. For firms that have flexible service
capacity, we show that it is optimal to employ aggressive advertisement
strategies in the early stages. Myopic naive firms often misinterpret the
market conditions and cease operating, where they could in fact realize profit.
For the cases where the capacity is not flexible, it may not be possible to
avoid negative WoM. Therefore, the service provider is forced to keep the level
of advertisements more compatible with the actual quality of the service. This
prevents the firm from overcrowding the system through advertisement without
considering the service quality.

two-scale equations, and a stochastic two-scale equation of the checker board

strength measurements from user devices to generate signal maps, which can be
used to improve network performance. Recognizing that this data collection may
be at odds with growing awareness of privacy concerns, we consider obfuscating
such data before the data leaves the mobile device. The goal is to increase
privacy such that it is difficult to recover sensitive features from the
obfuscated data (e.g. user ids and user whereabouts), while still allowing
network providers to use the data for improving network services (i.e. create
accurate signal maps). To examine this privacy-utility tradeoff, we identify
privacy and utility metrics and threat models suited to signal strength
measurements. We then obfuscate the measurements using several preeminent
techniques, spanning differential privacy, generative adversarial privacy, and
information-theoretic privacy techniques, in order to benchmark a variety of
promising obfuscation approaches and provide guidance to real-world engineers
who are tasked to build signal maps that protect privacy without hurting
utility. Our evaluation results, based on multiple, diverse, real-world signal
map datasets, demonstrate the feasibility of concurrently achieving adequate
privacy and utility, with obfuscation strategies which use the structure and
intended use of datasets in their design, and target average-case, rather than
worst-case, guarantees.

connectivity-oriented machine-type communication (CoM) and quality-oriented
machine-type communication (QoM), which take into account the stochastic
geometry-based deployment and the random active/inactive status of MTCDs.
Specifically, in the proposed schemes, the active Type-I MTCDs operate using a
novel Bernoulli random process-based simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) architecture. Next, utilizing multi-user power-domain
non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA), each active Type-I MTCD can
simultaneously communicate with another Type-I MTCD and a scalable number of
Type-II MTCDs. In the performance analysis of the proposed schemes, we prove
that the true distribution of the received power at a Type-II MTCD in the QoM
scheme can be approximated by the Singh-Maddala distribution. Exploiting this
unique statistical finding, we derive approximate closed-form expressions for
the outage probability (OP) and sum-throughput of massive MTC (mMTC) networks.
Through numerical results, we show that the proposed schemes provide a

strong-coupling theory that includes pair fluctuations beyond the commonly-used
many-body $T$-matrix or ladder approximation at the Gaussian level. The beyond
Gaussian pair fluctuation (GPF) theory always respects the exact thermodynamic
relations and recovers the Bogoliubov theory of molecules in the BEC limit with
a nearly correct molecule-molecule scattering length. We show that the

Horikoshi \textit{et al.} in Phys. Rev. X \textbf{7}, 041004 (2017). In the
unitary limit with infinitely large $s$-wave scattering length, the beyond-GPF
theory predicts a reliable universal energy equation of state up to 0.6$T_c$,
where $T_c$ is the superfluid transition temperature at unitarity. The theory
predicts a Bertsch parameter $\xi \simeq 0.365$ at zero temperature, in good
agreement with the latest quantum Monte Carlo result $\xi = 0.367(7)$ and the

the reasonable re-summation of Feynman diagrams following a dimensional

contrast, we find that for acyclic F-hypergraphs the problem is NP-hard, which
also implies the problem is hard in BF-hypergraphs. This is a striking
complexity boundary given that F-hypergraphs and B-hypergraphs would at first
seem to be symmetrical to one another. We provide the proof of complexity and
explain why there is a fundamental asymmetry between the two classes of

delays and losses exist between the plant and the supervisor for observation
and between the supervisor and the actuator for control. In this paper, we
first introduce a new framework for supervisory control of networked DESs.
Under the introduced framework, we address the state estimation problem for
supervisor synthesis of networked DESs with both communication delays and
losses. The estimation algorithm considers the effect of the controls imposed
on the system. Additionally, the estimation algorithm is based on the control
decisions available up to the moment, and all the future control decisions are
assumed to be unknowable. Two notions, called ""observation channel
configuration"" for tracking observation delays and losses and ""control channel
configuration"" for tracking control delays and losses, are defined. Then, we
introduce an online approach for state estimation of the controlled system.
Compared with the existing approach, the proposed approach under the introduced
framework can estimate the state of the controlled system more accurately. As
an application of the proposed approach, we finally show that the existing
methods can be easily applied to synthesize maximally permissible and safe
networked supervisors.

quantum interfaces or transducers map the entanglement onto stationary qubits.
The stationary qubits at the separated nodes constitute quantum memories
realized in matter while the flying qubits constitute quantum channels realized
in photons. Dedicated efforts around the world for more than twenty years have
resulted in both major theoretical and experimental progress towards entangling
quantum nodes and ultimately building a global quantum network. Here, we review
the development of quantum networks and the experimental progress over the past
two decades leading to the current state of the art for generating entanglement

  Tracing",,,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Estimating instruction-level throughput is critical for many applications:
multimedia, low-latency networking, medical, automotive, avionic, and
industrial control systems all rely on tightly calculable and accurate timing
bounds of their software. Unfortunately, how long a program may run - or if it
may indeed stop at all - cannot be answered in the general case. This is why
state-of-the-art throughput estimation tools usually focus on a subset of
operations and make several simplifying assumptions. Correctly identifying
these sets of constraints and regions of interest in the program typically
requires source code, specialized tools, and dedicated expert knowledge.
Whenever a single instruction is modified, this process must be repeated,
incurring high costs when iteratively developing timing sensitive code in
practice.
  In this paper, we present MCAD, a novel and lightweight timing analysis
framework that can identify the effects of code changes on the
microarchitectural level for binary programs. MCAD provides accurate
differential throughput estimates by emulating whole program execution using
QEMU and forwarding traces to LLVM for instruction-level analysis. This allows
developers to iterate quickly, with low overhead, using common tools:
identifying execution paths that are less sensitive to changes over
timing-critical paths only takes minutes within MCAD. To the best of our
knowledge this represents an entirely new capability that reduces turnaround
times for differential throughput estimation by several orders of magnitude
compared to state-of-the-art tools. Our detailed evaluation shows that MCAD
scales to real-world applications like FFmpeg and Clang with millions of
instructions, achieving < 3% geo mean error compared to ground truth timings
from hardware-performance counters on x86 and ARM machines.

to a one dimensional waveguide via multiple connection points or a continuous

analytic expressions for the single-photon scattering coefficients, which are
valid in both the Markovian and the non-arkovian regimes. We summarize the
influences of the non-dipole effects, mainly caused by the phases accumulated
by photons traveling between coupling points, on the scattering spectra. We
find that under the Markovian limit, the phase decay is detuning-independent,
resulting in Lorentzian lineshapes characterized by the Lamb shifts and the
effective decay rates. While in the non-Markovian regime, the accumulated
phases become detuning-dependent, giving rise to non-Lorentzian lineshapes,
characterized by multiple side peaks and total transmission points. Another
interesting phenomenon in the non-Markovian regime is generation of broad
photonic band gap by a single giant atom. We further generalize the case of
discrete coupling points to the continuum limit with atom coupling to the
waveguide via a continuous area, and analyze the scattering spectra for some
typical distributions of coupling strength.

framework to learn a mapping between scene images and crowd density maps. Under
the circumstances of such fully-supervised training settings, a large quantity
of expensive and time-consuming pixel-level annotations are required to
generate density maps as the supervision. One way to reduce costly labeling is
to exploit self-structural information and inner-relations among unlabeled
images. Unlike the previous methods utilizing these relations and structural
information from the original image level, we explore such self-relations from
the latent feature spaces because it can extract more abundant relations and
structural information. Specifically, we propose S$^2$FPR which can extract
structural information and learn partial orders of coarse-to-fine pyramid
features in the latent space for better crowd counting with massive unlabeled
images. In addition, we collect a new unlabeled crowd counting dataset
(FUDAN-UCC) with 4,000 images in total for training. One by-product is that our
proposed S$^2$FPR method can leverage numerous partial orders in the latent
space among unlabeled images to strengthen the model representation capability
and reduce the estimation errors for the crowd counting task. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets, i.e. the UCF-QNRF, the ShanghaiTech

automation and optimization of intelligent applications. It is a challenging
task, as we need to consider both complex intra-variable dependencies and
inter-variable dependencies. Existing works only learn temporal patterns with
the help of single inter-variable dependencies. However, there are multi-scale
temporal patterns in many real-world MTS. Single inter-variable dependencies
make the model prefer to learn one type of prominent and shared temporal
patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale adaptive graph neural network
(MAGNN) to address the above issue. MAGNN exploits a multi-scale pyramid
network to preserve the underlying temporal dependencies at different time
scales. Since the inter-variable dependencies may be different under distinct
time scales, an adaptive graph learning module is designed to infer the
scale-specific inter-variable dependencies without pre-defined priors. Given
the multi-scale feature representations and scale-specific inter-variable
dependencies, a multi-scale temporal graph neural network is introduced to
jointly model intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies.
After that, we develop a scale-wise fusion module to effectively promote the
collaboration across different time scales, and automatically capture the
importance of contributed temporal patterns. Experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that MAGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across
various settings.

error-prone. To reduce the reliance on labeled data, a new model called
SnapshotNet is proposed as a self-supervised feature learning approach, which
directly works on the unlabeled point cloud data of a complex 3D scene. The
SnapshotNet pipeline includes three stages. In the snapshot capturing stage,
snapshots, which are defined as local collections of points, are sampled from
the point cloud scene. A snapshot could be a view of a local 3D scan directly
captured from the real scene, or a virtual view of such from a large 3D point
cloud dataset. Snapshots could also be sampled at different sampling rates or
fields of view (FOVs), thus multi-FOV snapshots, to capture scale information
from the scene. In the feature learning stage, a new pre-text task called
multi-FOV contrasting is proposed to recognize whether two snapshots are from
the same object or not, within the same FOV or across different FOVs. Snapshots
go through two self-supervised learning steps: the contrastive learning step
with both part and scale contrasting, followed by a snapshot clustering step to
extract higher level semantic features. Then a weakly-supervised segmentation
stage is implemented by first training a standard SVM classifier on the learned
features with a small fraction of labeled snapshots. The trained SVM is used to
predict labels for input snapshots and predicted labels are converted into
point-wise label assignments for semantic segmentation of the entire scene
using a voting procedure. The experiments are conducted on the Semantic3D
dataset and the results have shown that the proposed method is capable of
learning effective features from snapshots of complex scene data without any

values in natural language processing, it suffers from incompleteness. This
paper focuses on knowledge graph completion by predicting linkage between

potential solution as it can deal with unseen entities, which the translational
distance based methods struggle with. However, to achieve competitive
performance as translational distance based methods, semantic matching based
methods require large-scale datasets for the training purpose, which are
typically unavailable in practical settings. Therefore, we employ the language
model and introduce a novel knowledge graph architecture named LP-BERT, which
contains two main stages: multi-task pre-training and knowledge graph
fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, three tasks are taken to drive the
model to learn the relationship from triples by predicting either entities or
relations. While in the fine-tuning phase, inspired by contrastive learning, we
design a triple-style negative sampling in a batch, which greatly increases the
proportion of negative sampling while keeping the training time almost
unchanged. Furthermore, we propose a new data augmentation method utilizing the
inverse relationship of triples to improve the performance and robustness of
the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on three widely-used datasets, WN18RR, FB15k-237, and UMLS. The

powerful informed adversary who knows all the training data points except one.
By instantiating concrete attacks, we show it is feasible to reconstruct the
remaining data point in this stringent threat model. For convex models (e.g.
logistic regression), reconstruction attacks are simple and can be derived in
closed-form. For more general models (e.g. neural networks), we propose an
attack strategy based on training a reconstructor network that receives as
input the weights of the model under attack and produces as output the target
data point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on image classifiers
trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and systematically investigate which factors of
standard machine learning pipelines affect reconstruction success. Finally, we
theoretically investigate what amount of differential privacy suffices to
mitigate reconstruction attacks by informed adversaries. Our work provides an
effective reconstruction attack that model developers can use to assess
memorization of individual points in general settings beyond those considered
in previous works (e.g. generative language models or access to training

information to enable high-fidelity reconstruction of training data points; and
it demonstrates that differential privacy can successfully mitigate such

exponential speedup over classical algorithms on DC power flow calculation.
Since the qubit resources in the Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum (NISQ) era
are limited, it is important to discuss the performance considering this
limitation. The coefficient matrix of the linear systems of equations in DC
power flow problems cannot be represented perfectly by finite binary number
strings, which leads to imperfect phase estimation. This work is carried out
under the assumption of imperfect phase estimation. The performance of the HHL

qubits. In order to further reduce the required qubit resources, a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm is proposed. By comparing errors of the HHL and
hybrid algorithms in the DC power flow calculation of the IEEE 5-bus test

with fewer qubits than HHL by increasing the number of phase estimation
modules, which may make the hybrid algorithm a feasible route in the NISQ era.

every served vertex must have a selected center not too far way. More
precisely, it is supposed that there exists at least one center among its
$\lceil (n-q) / k \rceil$ closest neighbors for every served vertex. Because
every center serves $(n-q) / k$ vertices on the average. The objective is to
select centers and outliers, assign every served vertex to some center, so as
to minimize the maximum fairness ratio over all served vertices, where the
fairness ratio of a vertex is defined as the ratio between its distance with

works mainly adopt two separate encoders for efficient retrieval, but ignore
local associations between videos and texts. Another line of research uses a
joint encoder to interact video with texts, but results in low efficiency since
each text-video pair needs to be fed into the model. In this work, we enable
fine-grained video-text interactions while maintaining high efficiency for
retrieval via a novel pretext task, dubbed as Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ),
where a parametric module BridgeFormer is trained to answer the ""questions""
constructed by the text features via resorting to the video features.
Specifically, we exploit the rich semantics of text (i.e., nouns and verbs) to
build questions, with which the video encoder can be trained to capture more
regional content and temporal dynamics. In the form of questions and answers,
the semantic associations between local video-text features can be properly
established. BridgeFormer is able to be removed for downstream retrieval,
rendering an efficient and flexible model with only two encoders. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the popular text-to-video retrieval
task in five datasets with different experimental setups (i.e., zero-shot and
fine-tune), including HowTo100M (one million videos). We further conduct
zero-shot action recognition, which can be cast as video-to-text retrieval, and

dancing video retargeting, which learns to synthesize videos of unseen persons
by leveraging a few frames of them. In practice, given a few frames of a
person, these work simply regarded them as a batch of individual images without
temporal correlations, thus generating temporally incoherent dancing videos of
low visual quality. In this work, we model a few frames of a person as a series
of dancing moves, where each move contains two consecutive frames, to extract
the appearance patterns and the temporal dynamics of this person. We propose
MetaDance, which utilizes temporal-aware meta-learning to optimize the

meta-trained model can be efficiently tuned towards enhanced visual quality and
strengthened temporal stability for unseen persons with a few frames. Extensive

successfully perform real-space and real-time imaging of electronic

distinctive temperature-dependent rates, which is common to conventional
crystallization. Remarkably, however, the growth rate is many orders of

the quantum effect. The temperature characteristics of nucleation and growth
are universal, whereas unusually fast growth kinetics features quantum

applications including artificial tissue design and surgical planning. The
basis of these models, and their advantage over their phenomenological

the tissue's microscale structure and constitutive behaviour and can therefore
be used to predict the effects of structural changes to the tissue. Although
studies have attempted to determine such parameters using diverse,
state-of-the-art, experimental techniques, values ranging over several orders
of magnitude have been reported, leading to uncertainty in the true parameter
values and creating a need for models that can handle such uncertainty. We
derive a microstructural, hyperelastic model for transversely isotropic soft
tissues and use it to model the mechanical behaviour of tendons. To account for
parameter uncertainty, we employ a Bayesian approach and apply an adaptive
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to determine posterior probability
distributions for the model parameters. The obtained posterior distributions
are consistent with parameter measurements previously reported and enable us to
quantify the uncertainty in their values for each tendon sample that was
modelled. This approach could serve as a prototype for quantifying parameter
uncertainty in other soft tissues.

the first Antarctica polar photometer. Unprecedented and uninterrupted U BV RI
time-series photometric ground-based data are collected during 150 days from
the highest plateau of Antarctica. PAIX light curve analyses reveal an even
richer power spectrum with mixed modes in RR Lyrae stars. A nonlinear nature of
several dominant peaks, showing lower and higher frequencies, occur around the
dominant fundamental radial pressure mode. These lower frequencies and
harmonics linearly interact with the dominant fundamental radial pressure mode
and its second and third overtone pressure modes as well. Half-integer
frequencies are also detected, likewise side peak structures demonstrating that
HH puppis is a bona-fide Blazhko star. Fourier correlations are used to derive
underlying physical characteristics for HH puppis. The most striking finding is
the direct detection of gravity waves. We interpret the excitation mechanism of
gravity waves in RR Lyrae stars by the penetrative convection driving
mechanism. We demonstrate that RR Lyrae stars pulsation is excited by several
distinct mechanisms, and hence RR Lyrae stars are simultaneously g modes and p
modes pulsators. Our discoveries make RR Lyrae stars very challenging stellar
objects, and provide their potential to undergo at the same time g modes and p

which describes the interaction between the interface separating two demixed
Bose-condensed gases and an optical hard wall at a distance l. Previous work
revealed that this interaction gives rise to extraordinary wetting and
prewetting phenomena. Calculations that explore non-equilibrium properties by
using l as a constraint provide a thorough explanation for this behavior. We
find that at bulk two-phase coexistence, V (l) for both complete wetting and
partial wetting is monotonic with exponential decay. Remarkably, at the
first-order wetting phase transition, V(l) is independent of l. This anomaly
explains the infinite continuous degeneracy of the grand potential reported
earlier. As a physical application, using V(l) we study the three-phase contact
line where the interface meets the wall under a contact angle theta. Employing
an interface displacement model we calculate the structure of this
inhomogeneity and its line tension tau. Contrary to what happens at a usual
first-order wetting transition in systems with short-range forces, tau does not
approach a nonzero positive constant for theta going to zero, but instead
approaches zero (from below) as would be expected for a critical wetting
transition. This hybrid character of tau is a consequence of the absence of a
barrier in V(l) at wetting. For a typical V(l) we provide a conjecture for the
exact line tension within GP theory.

equal to one, and it does not exist in the spin-1/2 nucleons. Since there is no
direct contribution from the nucleons, it is an appropriate quantity to probe
an exotic component in the spin-1 deuteron beyond a simple bound system of the
nucleons. We show how the gluon transversity can be measured at hadron
accelerator facilities by the Drell-Yan process in addition to
lepton-accelerator experiments. Next, possible TMDs are explained for the
spin-1 hadrons at the twists 3 and 4 in addition to twist-2 ones by considering
tensor polarizations. We found that 30 TMDs exist in the tensor-polarized
spin-1 hadron at the twists 3 and 4 in addition to 10 TMDs at the twist 2.
There are 3 collinear PDFs at the twists 3 and 4. We also indicate that the
corresponding TMD fragmentation functions exist at the twists 3 and 4. Due to
the time-reversal invariance in the collinear PDFs, there are new sum rules on
the time-reversal odd TMDs. In addition, we obtained a useful twist-2 relation,
a sum rule, and relations with multiparton distribution functions by using the
operator product expansion and the equation of motion for quarks. These

the choice of another word's sense, making WSD a combinatorial optimization

four-point vertex of interacting fermionic many-body systems is a conceptually
and computationally appealing parametrization of the vertex. It relies on the
notion of reducibility of vertex diagrams with respect to the bare interaction
$U$, instead of a classification based on two-particle reducibility within the
widely-used parquet decomposition. Here, we re-derive the SBE decomposition in
a generalized framework (suitable for extensions to, e.g., inhomogeneous
systems or real-frequency treatments) following from the parquet equations. We
then derive multiloop functional renormalization group (mfRG) flow equations
for the ingredients of this SBE decomposition, both in the parquet
approximation, where the fully two-particle irreducible vertex is treated as an
input, and in the more restrictive SBE approximation, where this role is taken
by the fully $U$-irreducible vertex. Moreover, we give mfRG flow equations for
the popular parametrization of the vertex in terms of asymptotic classes of the
two-particle reducible vertices. Since the parquet and SBE decompositions are
closely related, their mfRG flow equations are very similar in structure.

violates the exclusion restriction: (i) failing to control for internal
migration, (ii) insufficient control for confounders correlated with their
instrument, and (iii) emigration measured with a nonclassical measurement
error. Second, I also discuss two problems with the statistical inference, both

no relationship between emigration and political outcomes.

characterising exoplanets is seeing a revival, specifically from missions such
as the proposed Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). A default
assumption since the design studies of Darwin and TPF-I has been that the Emma
X-array configuration is the optimal architecture for this goal. Here, we
examine whether new advances in the field of nulling interferometry, such as
the concept of kernel nulling, challenge this assumption.
  Methods: We develop a tool designed to derive the photon-limited signal to
noise ratio of a large sample of simulated planets for different architecture
configurations and beam combination schemes. We simulate four basic
configurations: the double Bracewell/X-array, and kernel nullers with three,
four and five telescopes respectively.
  Results: We find that a configuration of five telescopes in a pentagonal
shape, using a five aperture kernel nulling scheme, outperforms the X-array
design in both search (finding more planets) and characterisation (obtaining
better signal, faster) when total collecting area is conserved. This is
especially the case when trying to detect Earth twins (temperate, rocky planets
in the habitable zone), showing a 23% yield increase over the X-array. On
average, we find that a five telescope design receives 1.2 times the signal
over the X-array design.
  Conclusions: With the results of this simulation, we conclude that the Emma
X-array configuration may not be the best architecture choice for the upcoming
LIFE mission, and that a five telescope design utilising kernel nulling
concepts will likely provide better scientific return for the same collecting
area, provided that technical solutions for the required achromatic phase
shifts can be implemented.

designed and using the transistor nonlinearity effect (third-order
nonlinearity) entangled microwave photons are created. It is supposed that the
low noise amplifier contains two coupled oscillators resonating with different
frequencies. The mentioned oscillators are coupled to each other through the
gate-drain capacitor and nonlinear transconductance as an important factor by
which the entangled microwave photons are strongly manipulated. For
entanglement analysis, the Hamiltonian of the system is initially derived, then
using the dynamic equation of motion of the designed amplifier the oscillator's

microwave photons at very low intrinsic transconductance and more importantly
when the noise figure is strongly minimized. Additionally, a cryogenic low

trees are widely studied and used in data engineering and computer science.
Typically, in real-world applications, the features of the graph tend to change
over time, thus, finding a solution to the problem becomes challenging. The
dynamic version of many graph problems are the key for a plethora of real-world
problems in transportation, telecommunication, and social networks. In recent
years, using deep learning techniques to find heuristic solutions for NP-hard
graph combinatorial problems has gained much interest as these learned
heuristics can find near-optimal solutions efficiently. However, most of the
existing methods for learning heuristics focus on static graph problems. The
dynamic nature makes NP-hard graph problems much more challenging to learn, and
the existing methods fail to find reasonable solutions.
  In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Graph Temporal Attention
with Reinforcement Learning (GTA-RL) to learn heuristic solutions for
graph-based dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. The GTA-RL
architecture consists of an encoder capable of embedding temporal features of a
combinatorial problem instance and a decoder capable of dynamically focusing on
the embedded features to find a solution to a given combinatorial problem
instance. We then extend our architecture to learn heuristics for the real-time
version of combinatorial optimization problems where all input features of a
problem are not known a prior, but rather learned in real-time. Our
experimental results against several state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms
and optimal solvers demonstrate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art learning-based approaches in terms of effectiveness and
optimal solvers in terms of efficiency on dynamic and real-time graph
combinatorial optimization.

super-resolution (SR) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While there
can be many high-resolution (HR) solutions for a given input, most existing
CNN-based methods do not explore alternative solutions during the inference. A
typical approach to obtaining alternative SR results is to train multiple SR
models with different loss weightings and exploit the combination of these
models. Instead of using multiple models, we present a more efficient method to
train a single adjustable SR model on various combinations of losses by taking
advantage of multi-task learning. Specifically, we optimize an SR model with a
conditional objective during training, where the objective is a weighted sum of
multiple perceptual losses at different feature levels. The weights vary
according to given conditions, and the set of weights is defined as a style
controller. Also, we present an architecture appropriate for this training
scheme, which is the Residual-in-Residual Dense Block equipped with spatial
feature transformation layers. At the inference phase, our trained model can
generate locally different outputs conditioned on the style control map.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed SR model produces various
desirable reconstructions without artifacts and yields comparable quantitative
performance to state-of-the-art SR methods.

mechanism of three-dimensional (3D) single-mode RTI and the influences of
extensive dimensionless Reynolds number and Atwood number on phase interfacial

Reynolds number, it is reported that the development of 3D single-mode RTI
would undergo four different stages: linear growth stage, saturated velocity
growth stage, reacceleration stage and turbulent mixing stage. A series of
complex interfacial structures with large topological changes can be observed
at the turbulent mixing stage, which always preserve the symmetries with
respect to the middle axis at a low Atwood number, and the lines of symmetry
within spike and bubble are broken as the Atwood number is increased. Five
statistical methods for computing the spike and bubble growth rates are then
analyzed to reveal the growth law of 3D single-mode RTI in turbulent mixing
stage. It is found that the spike late-time growth rate shows an overall
increase with the Atwood number, while the bubble growth rate seems to be
independence of the Atwood number, approaching a constant of around 0.1. When
the Reynolds number decreases, the later stages cannot be reached gradually and
the evolution of phase interface presents a laminar flow state.

  We investigate in particular a ternary, $Z_3$-graded generalization of the
Heisenberg algebra. It turns out that introducing a non-trivial cubic root of
unity, $j = e^{\frac{2 \pi i}{3}}$, one can define two types of creation
operators instead of one, accompanying the usual annihilation operator. The two
creation operators are non-hermitian, but they are mutually conjugate.
Together, the three operators form a ternary algebra, and some of their cubic
combinations generate the usual Heisenberg algebra.
  An analogue of Hamiltonian operator is constructed by analogy with the usual
harmonic oscillator, and some properties of its eigenfunctions are briefly
discussed.

endoscopic simulation systems are used for training or rehearsal of endoscope

endoscopic images. To improve the value of the simulation systems, improvement
of reality of their generated images is necessary. We propose a realistic image
generation method for endoscopic simulation systems. Virtual endoscopic images
are generated by using a volume rendering method from a CT volume of a patient.
We improve the reality of the virtual endoscopic images using a virtual-to-real
image-domain translation technique. The image-domain translator is implemented
as a fully convolutional network (FCN). We train the FCN by minimizing a cycle
consistency loss function. The FCN is trained using unpaired virtual and real
endoscopic images. To obtain high quality image-domain translation results, we
perform an image cleansing to the real endoscopic image set. We tested to use
the shallow U-Net, U-Net, deep U-Net, and U-Net having residual units as the
image-domain translator. The deep U-Net and U-Net having residual units
generated quite realistic images.

contracts on blockchains that problem presents itself in a new light. Smart
contracts are self-contained pieces of software that control assets, which are
often of high financial value, in an adversarial environment and, once
committed to the blockchain, they cannot be changed anymore. Smart contracts
are typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to
low-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a
smart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain,
they must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching
source code and (b) that the compiler faithfully translated the source code's
semantics.
  Classic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue
that translation certification also addresses the first. We describe the proof
architecture of a novel translation certification framework, implemented in
Coq, for a functional smart contract language. We demonstrate that we can model
the compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations that facilitate
a modular proof approach and are robust in the face of an evolving compiler
implementation.

America). The scaling exponent of Europe is near that of the random noise
(0.5), while the other continents are slightly persistent in precipitation. We
also show that the persistence disappears in all time series when shuffling the

function of area, although not so clearly. Furthermore, our analysis shows that
the persistence of the temperature decreases poleward in both hemispheres. The
persistence of precipitation is also highest at equatorial zones, and decreases
poleward, but is less dependent on the latitude than temperature. It seems that
the persistence of the precipitation is more dependent on the corresponding

operator and its adjoint. However, in practical applications like computerized
tomography, it is often computationally favourable to replace the adjoint
operator by a computationally more efficient approximation. This leads to an
adjoint mismatch in the algorithm.
  In this paper, we analyze the convergence of Chambolle-Pock's primal-dual
method under the presence of a mismatched adjoint in the strongly convex

derive stepsizes and mild conditions under which convergence to a fixed point

they often derive individual human movement indicators in their most detail.
However, such agent-based models tend to be difficult and require much
information and computational power to correctly predict the commutation
behavior of large mobility systems. Mobility information can be costly and
researchers often cannot acquire it dynamically over large areas, which leads
to a lack of adequate calibration parameters, rendering the easy and
spontaneous prediction of mobility in additional areas impossible. This paper
targets this problem and represents a concept that combines multiple
substantial mobility theorems formulated in recent years to reduce the amount
of required information compared to existing simulations. Our concept also
targets computational expenses and aims to reduce them to enable a global
prediction of mobility. Inspired by methods from other domains, the core idea
of the conceptional innovation can be compared to weather models, which predict
weather on a large scale, on an adequate level of regional information

in real-world applications. Selection bias is one of the most important issues
of the existing observational data based approaches, which is actually caused
by multiple types of unobserved exposure strategies (e.g. promotions and
holiday effects). Though various methods have been proposed to address this
problem, they are mainly relying on the implicit debiasing techniques but not
explicitly modeling the unobserved exposure strategies. By explicitly
Reconstructing Exposure STrategies (REST in short), we formalize the
recommendation problem as the counterfactual reasoning and propose the debiased
social recommendation method. In REST, we assume that the exposure of an item
is controlled by the latent exposure strategies, the user, and the item. Based
on the above generation process, we first provide the theoretical guarantee of
our method via identification analysis. Second, we employ a variational
auto-encoder to reconstruct the latent exposure strategies, with the help of
the social networks and the items. Third, we devise a counterfactual reasoning
based recommendation algorithm by leveraging the recovered exposure strategies.

queries, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in the hypergraph
$\mathcal{H}$ and $C_{d}$ is a constant that depends only on $d$}. Our result
coupled with the framework of Dell {\it{et al.}}~[SODA '21] implies improved

fields of the two spectroscopic binary T Tauri stars V1878 Ori and V4046 Sgr.
This is done to complete the observational characterisation of the surface
magnetic fields of these stars because only their large-scale magnetic fields
have been studied with Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) so far. Methods. To
investigate the small-scale magnetic fields, the differential Zeeman
intensification of near-infrared Ti I lines was investigated using
high-resolution archival spectra obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectrograph at the
CFHT. In order to study the binary components separately, the spectra were
disentangled by considering observations taken at different orbital phases. The
Zeeman-intensification analysis was performed based on detailed polarised
radiative transfer calculations aided by the Markov chain Monte Carlo
inference, treating magnetic field filling factors and other stellar parameters
that could affect the spectra as free parameters. Results. The obtained average
magnetic field strengths of the components of V1878 Ori are 1.33 and 1.57 kG,
respectively. Previous ZDI studies of V1878 Ori recovered about 14 and 20% of
this magnetic field strength. For V4046 Sgr, the magnetic field strengths are
1.96 and 1.83 kG, respectively. In this case, about 12 and 9% of the total
magnetic field strength was detected by ZDI. Conclusions. The small-scale
magnetic field strengths obtained from Zeeman intensification are similar for
the two components of each binary. This is in contrast to the large-scale
magnetic fields obtained from ZDI investigations, performed using the same
observations. While the large-scale field might look significantly different.
This indicates that the efficiency of the magnetic dynamo is comparable for the
components of the two binaries, because most energy is carreid by the small
scale fields.

infected premises, and feed deliveries has not been fully considered in the
dissemination dynamics of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). This has
limited efforts for disease control and elimination restricting the development
of risk-based resource allocation to the most relevant modes of PEDV
dissemination. Here, we modeled nine modes of between-farm transmission
pathways including farm-to-farm proximity (local transmission), contact network
of pig farm movements between sites, four different contact networks of
transportation vehicles (vehicles that transport pigs from farm-to-farm, pigs
to markets, feed distribution and crew), the volume of animal by-products
within feed diets (e.g. animal fat and meat and bone meal) to reproduce PEDV
transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated in space and time with weekly
PEDV outbreaks. We investigated the model performance to identify outbreak
locations and the contribution of each route in the dissemination of PEDV. The
model estimated that 42.7% of the infections in sow farms were related to
vehicles transporting feed, 34.5% of infected nurseries were associated with
vehicles transporting pigs to farms, and for both farm types, pig movements or
local transmission were the next most relevant routes. On the other hand,
finishers were most often (31.4%) infected via local transmission, followed by
the vehicles transporting feed and pigs to farm networks. Feed ingredients did
not significantly improve model calibration metrics. The proposed modeling
framework provides an evaluation of PEDV transmission dynamics, ranking the
most important routes of PEDV dissemination and granting the swine industry

plenitude of combinations between decision criteria, uncertainty sets and
underlying nominal problems are considered. Usually, a robust problem becomes
harder to solve than its nominal counterpart, even if it remains in the same
complexity class. For this reason, specialized solution algorithms have been
developed. To further drive the development of stronger solution algorithms and
to facilitate the comparison between methods, a set of benchmark instances is
necessary but so far missing. In this paper we propose a further step towards
this goal by proposing several instance generation procedures for combinations
of min-max, min-max regret, two-stage and recoverable robustness with interval,
discrete or budgeted uncertainty sets. Besides sampling methods that go beyond
the simple uniform sampling method that is the de-facto standard to produce
instances, also optimization models to construct hard instances are considered.
Using a selection problem for the nominal ground problem, we are able to
generate instances that are several orders of magnitudes harder to solve than
uniformly sampled instances when solving them with a general mixed-integer

has been uncertain whether both camera and IMU intrinsic parameters are
observable under general motion. To answer this question, by using the Lie
derivatives, we first prove that for a rolling shutter (RS) camera-IMU system,
all intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, camera time offset, and readout time of
the RS camera, are observable with an unknown landmark. To our knowledge, we
are the first to present such a proof. Next, to validate this analysis and to
solve the drift issue of a structureless filter during standstills, we develop
a Keyframe-based Sliding Window Filter (KSWF) for odometry and
self-calibration, which works with a monocular RS camera or stereo RS cameras.
Though the keyframe concept is widely used in vision-based sensor fusion, to
our knowledge, KSWF is the first of its kind to support self-calibration. Our
simulation and real data tests have validated that it is possible to fully
calibrate the camera-IMU system using observations of opportunistic landmarks
under diverse motion. Real data tests confirmed previous allusions that keeping
landmarks in the state vector can remedy the drift in standstill, and showed
that the keyframe-based scheme is an alternative solution.

observational data and investigate its evolution through cosmic history. We
consider the latest SNIa, BAO and cosmic chronometer data and reconstruct the
dark energy density in both flat and non-flat universes up to redshift $z\sim
3$. The results are well in agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM up to redshift
$z\sim 1.5$, whereas all data and methods, in our analysis, provide a negative

memory-efficient Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE). In the term
""memory-efficient"" SSE, we encompass both the goals of local SSE, and
page-efficient SSE. The centerpiece of our approach is a novel connection
between those two goals. We introduce a map, called the Generic Local
Transform, which takes as input a page-efficient SSE scheme with certain
special features, and outputs an SSE scheme with strong locality properties. We
obtain several results.
  (1) First, for page-efficient SSE, we build a dynamic scheme with page
efficiency $O(\log \log N)$ and storage efficiency $O(1)$, called LayeredSSE.
The main technical innovation behind LayeredSSE is a new weighted extension of
the two-choice allocation process, of independent interest.
  (2) Second, we introduce the Generic Local Transform, and combine it with
LayeredSSE to build a dynamic SSE scheme with storage efficiency $O(1)$,
locality $O(1)$, and read efficiency $O(\log\log N)$, under the condition that
the longest list is of size $O(N^{1-1/\log \log \lambda})$. This matches, in
every respect, the purely static construction of Asharov et al. presented at
STOC 2016: dynamism comes at no extra cost.
  (3) Finally, by applying the Generic Local Transform to a variant of the
Tethys scheme by Bossuat et al. from Crypto 2021, we build an unconditional
static SSE with storage efficiency $O(1)$, locality $O(1)$, and read efficiency
$O(\log^\varepsilon N)$, for an arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon > 0$.
To our knowledge, this is the construction that comes closest to the lower
bound presented by Cash and Tessaro at Eurocrypt 2014.

retrieving a particular photo in a given query sketch. However, its widespread
applicability is limited by the fact that it is difficult to draw a complete
sketch for most people, and the drawing process often takes time. In this
study, we aim to retrieve the target photo with the least number of strokes
possible (incomplete sketch), named on-the-fly FG-SBIR (Bhunia et al. 2020),
which starts retrieving at each stroke as soon as the drawing begins. We
consider that there is a significant correlation among these incomplete
sketches in the sketch drawing episode of each photo. To learn more efficient
joint embedding space shared between the photo and its incomplete sketches, we
propose a multi-granularity association learning framework that further
optimizes the embedding space of all incomplete sketches. Specifically, based
on the integrity of the sketch, we can divide a complete sketch episode into
several stages, each of which corresponds to a simple linear mapping layer.
Moreover, our framework guides the vector space representation of the current
sketch to approximate that of its later sketches to realize the retrieval
performance of the sketch with fewer strokes to approach that of the sketch
with more strokes. In the experiments, we proposed more realistic challenges,
and our method achieved superior early retrieval efficiency over the
state-of-the-art methods and alternative baselines on two publicly available
fine-grained sketch retrieval datasets.

loss and the migration of tropical species to temperate basins. Monitoring the
underwater environments and their inhabitants is of fundamental importance to
understand the evolution of these systems and implement safeguard policies.
However, assessing and tracking biodiversity is often a complex task,
especially in large and uncontrolled environments, such as the oceans. One of
the most popular and effective methods for monitoring marine biodiversity is
passive acoustics monitoring (PAM), which employs hydrophones to capture
underwater sound. Many aquatic animals produce sounds characteristic of their
own species; these signals travel efficiently underwater and can be detected
even at great distances. Furthermore, modern technologies are becoming more and
more convenient and precise, allowing for very accurate and careful data
acquisition. To date, audio captured with PAM devices is frequently manually
processed by marine biologists and interpreted with traditional signal
processing techniques for the detection of animal vocalizations. This is a
challenging task, as PAM recordings are often over long periods of time.
Moreover, one of the causes of biodiversity loss is sound pollution; in data
obtained from regions with loud anthropic noise, it is hard to separate the
artificial from the fish sound manually. Nowadays, machine learning and, in
particular, deep learning represents the state of the art for processing audio
signals. Specifically, sound separation networks are able to identify and
separate human voices and musical instruments. In this work, we show that the
same techniques can be successfully used to automatically extract fish
vocalizations in PAM recordings, opening up the possibility for biodiversity
monitoring at a large scale.

unnecessary network connections can potentially be eliminated without degrading
network performance. Therefore, well-designed sparse neural networks have the
potential to significantly reduce FLOPs and computational resources. In this
work, we propose a new automatic pruning method - Sparse Connectivity Learning
(SCL). Specifically, a weight is re-parameterized as an element-wise
multiplication of a trainable weight variable and a binary mask. Thus, network
connectivity is fully described by the binary mask, which is modulated by a
unit step function. We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using a
straight-through estimator (STE) for network pruning. This principle is that
the proxy gradients of STE should be positive, ensuring that mask variables
converge at their minima. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and Identity STEs
can satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt Identity STE in SCL for
discrete mask relaxation. We find that mask gradients of different features are
very unbalanced, hence, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature
to optimize mask variable training. In order to automatically train sparse
masks, we include the total number of network connections as a regularization
term in our objective function. As SCL does not require pruning criteria or
hyper-parameters defined by designers for network layers, the network is
explored in a larger hypothesis space to achieve optimized sparse connectivity
for the best performance. SCL overcomes the limitations of existing automatic
pruning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SCL can automatically
learn and select important network connections for various baseline network
structures. Deep learning models trained by SCL outperform the SOTA
human-designed and automatic pruning methods in sparsity, accuracy, and FLOPs
reduction.

Sometimes, transaction workloads can be safely executed under RC obtaining
serializability at the lower cost of RC. Such workloads are said to be robust
against RC. Previous work has yielded a tractable procedure for deciding
robustness against RC for workloads generated by transaction programs modeled
as transaction templates. An important insight of that work is that, by more
accurately modeling transaction programs, we are able to recognize larger sets
of workloads as robust. In this work, we increase the modeling power of
transaction templates by extending them with functional constraints, which are
useful for capturing data dependencies like foreign keys. We show that the
incorporation of functional constraints can identify more workloads as robust
that otherwise would not be. Even though we establish that the robustness

detecting payloads within a received orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) radio frame requires the execution of a large number of inner product
operations, which are the main computational burden of the algorithm. Although
inner-product operations consist of simple kernel evaluations, their vast
number poses a challenge in ultra-low latency (ULL) applications, because the
time needed for computing the inner products might exceed the sub-millisecond
latency requirement. To address this problem, this study demonstrates the
acceleration of the inner-product operations through massive parallelization.
The result is a GPU-accelerated real-time OFDM receiver that enables
sub-millisecond latency detection to meet the requirements of 5th generation
(5G) and beyond ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) systems.
Moreover, the parallelization and acceleration techniques explored and
demonstrated in this study can be extended to many other signal processing
algorithms in Hilbert spaces, such as those based on projection onto convex

alkali effect (MAE) in oxide glasses is of fundamental importance for tailoring
the glass compositions to control the mobility of ions and, therefore, the
glass properties that depend on it, such as ion release, glass transition
temperature, and ionic conductivity. However, most of the previously designed
bioactive glasses were based on trial-and-error, which is due to the complex
glass structure that is non-trivial to analyze and, thus, the lack of a clear
picture of the glass structure at short- and medium-range order. Accordingly,
we use molecular dynamics simulations to study whether using the MAE can
control the bioactivity and properties of 45S5 glass and its structural
origins. We showed that the network connectivity, a structural parameter often
used to access the bioactivity of silicate glasses, does not change with Na
substitution with Li or K. On the contrary, the elastic moduli showed a strong
dependence on the type of the modifier, as they increased with increasing mean
field strength. Similarly, the mobility of the glass elements was significantly
affected by the type of modifier used to substitute Na. The change of the
properties is further discussed and explained using changes at the short- and
medium-range structure by giving evidence of previous experimental findings.
Finally, we highlight the origin of the non-existence of the MAE, the effect of
the modifier on the bioactivity of the glasses, the importance of dynamical
descriptors in predicting the bioactivity of oxide glasses, and we provide the
necessary insights, at the atomic scale, needed for further development of

critical points with randomness, from a conceptually novel angle where the
quenched disorder can be considered as dimensionally reducible interactions. As
a concrete example, we reveal novel entanglement signatures of
$(2+1)$-dimensional Dirac fermion exposed to a random magnetic field, which
hosts a class of emergent disordered quantum critical points. We demonstrate
that the entanglement entropy satisfies the area-law scaling, and observe a
modification of the area-law coefficient that points to the emergent disordered
quantum criticality. Moreover, we also obtain the sub-leading correction to the
entanglement entropy due to a finite correlation length. This sub-leading
correction is found to be a universal function of the correlation length and
disorder strength. We discuss its connection to the renormalization group flows
of underlying theories.

thereby serve a dual function by enhancing the uptake of precursors and

($100+$~m) structures to initiate. It may be either triggered by other
lightning discharges or completely self-initiated. While conventional lightning
location systems reliably detect downward lightning, they miss a specific flash
type of upward lightning that consists only of a continuous current. Globally,
only few specially instrumented towers can detect this flash type. The
proliferation of wind turbines in combination with large damage from upward
lightning necessitates an improved understanding under which conditions the
self-initiated and the undetected subtype of upward lightning occur. To find
larger-scale meteorological conditions favorable for self-initiated and
undetectable upward lightning, this study uses a random forest machine learning
model. It combines direct measurements at the specially instrumented tower at
Gaisberg mountain in Austria with explanatory variables from larger-scale
atmospheric reanalysis data (ERA5). Atmospheric variables reliably explain
whether upward lightning is self-initiated by the tower or triggered by other
lightning discharges. The most important variable is the height of the
$-10~^\circ$C isotherm above the tall structure: the closer it is the higher is
the probability of self-initiated upward lightning. Two-meter temperature and
the amount of CAPE are also important. For the occurrence of upward lightning
undetectable by lightning location systems, this study finds a strong
relationship to the absence of lightning in the vicinity.

Neuron-specific dropout (NSDropout) is a tool to address this problem.
NSDropout looks at both the training pass, and validation pass, of a layer in a
model. By comparing the average values produced by each neuron for each class
in a data set, the network is able to drop targeted units. The layer is able to
predict what features, or noise, the model is looking at during testing that
isn't present when looking at samples from validation. Unlike dropout, the
""thinned"" networks cannot be ""unthinned"" for testing. Neuron-specific dropout
has proved to achieve similar, if not better, testing accuracy with far less
data than traditional methods including dropout and other regularization
methods. Experimentation has shown that neuron-specific dropout reduces the
chance of a network overfitting and reduces the need for large training samples
on supervised learning tasks in image recognition, all while producing
best-in-class results.

available in limited regions or time periods, for example, observational data
from field campaigns, or data generated in local high-resolution simulations.
This raises the question of where and when to acquire additional data to be
maximally informative about parameterizations in a GCM. Here we construct a new
ensemble-based parallel algorithm to automatically target data acquisition to
regions and times that maximize the uncertainty reduction, or information gain,
about GCM parameters. The algorithm uses a Bayesian framework that exploits a
quantified distribution of GCM parameters as a measure of uncertainty. This
distribution is informed by time-averaged climate statistics restricted to
local regions and times. The algorithm is embedded in the recently developed
calibrate-emulate-sample (CES) framework, which performs efficient model
calibration and uncertainty quantification with only $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ model
evaluations, compared with $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ evaluations typically needed for
traditional approaches to Bayesian calibration. We demonstrate the algorithm
with an idealized GCM, with which we generate surrogates of local data. In this
perfect-model setting, we calibrate parameters and quantify uncertainties in a
quasi-equilibrium convection scheme in the GCM. We consider targeted data that
are (i) localized in space for statistically stationary simulations, and (ii)
localized in space and time for seasonally varying simulations. In these
proof-of-concept applications, the calculated information gain reflects the
reduction in parametric uncertainty obtained from Bayesian inference when
harnessing a targeted sample of data. The largest information gain typically,

articles extracted from the two popular databases: Scopus and Web of Science
(WoS). PRISMA statement 2015 was used to include and exclude that data. At
first, a bibliometric analysis was carried out using 346 articles considering
the following factors: publication by year, journal, authors, countries,
institutions, authors' keywords, and citations. Finally, qualitative analysis
was carried out based on selected 32 articles considering the following
factors: a conceptual framework, schedule problems, security, COVID-19, digital
supply chain, and blockchain technology. Study finding suggests that during the
onset of COVID-19, health care and industry 4.0 has been merged and evolved
jointly, considering various crisis such as data security, resource allocation,
and data transparency. Industry 4.0 enables many technologies such as the
internet of things (IoT), blockchain, big data, cloud computing, machine
learning, deep learning, information, and communication technologies (ICT) to
track patients' records and helps reduce social transmission COVID-19 and so
on. The study findings will give future researchers and practitioners some
insights regarding the integration of health care and Industry 4.0.

The net income of households has been increased a lot as well. Nonetheless,
migration from rural areas to urban sectors tends to keep a high saving rate

Square regression, along with the method of Instrument Variable to test the
problem of endogeneity, to discover the relationship between the saving rates
of rural households and labor migration, controlling for other characteristic
variables including having insurance, marital status, education, having
children, health conditions. The assumption is that migration contributes
positively to the dependent variable, meaning that migration could increase the
household save rates. However, the conclusion is that it is negatively with the
household save rates. All the other variables regarding education, health
conditions, marital status, insurance, and number of children are negatively

serious complications from COVID-19. Nearly 1 in 5 COVID-19 deaths in the
African region are linked to diabetes. World Health Organization (WHO) finds
that 18.3% of COVID-19 deaths in Africa are among people with diabetes. In this
paper, we have formulated and analysed a mathematical comorbidity model of
diabetes - COVID-19 of the deterministic type. The basic properties of the
model were explored. The basic reproductive number, equilibrium points and
stability of the equilibrium points were examined. Sensitivity analysis of the
model was carried on to determine the impact of the model parameters on the
basic reproduction number of the model. The model had a unique endemic
equilibrium point, which was stable for R_0>1. Time-dependent optimal controls
were incorporated into the model with the sole aim of determining the best
strategy for curtailing the spread of the disease. COVID-19 cases from March to
September 2020 in Ghana were used to validate the model. Results of the
numerical simulation suggest a greater number of individuals deceased when the
infected individual had an underlying condition of diabetes. More so COVID-19
is endemic in Ghana with the basic reproduction number found to be R_0=1.4722.
The numerical simulation of the optimal control model reveals the lockdown
control minimized the rate of decay of the susceptible individuals whereas the
vaccination led to a number of susceptible individuals becoming immune to
COVID-19 infections. In all the two preventive control measures were both
effective in curbing the spread of the COVID-19 disease as the number of
COVID-19 infections was greatly reduced. We conclude that more attention should
be paid to COVID-19 patients with an underlying condition of diabetes as the
probability of death in this population was significantly higher.

using both membership and equivalence queries, (iv) using proper equivalence
queries, and (v) using both membership and proper equivalence queries. As time
complexity, we study the depth of decision trees. In the worst case, with the
growth of the number of elements in the problem description, the minimum depth
of decision trees of the first type either grows as a logarithm or linearly,

bounded from above by a constant or grows as a logarithm, or linearly. The
obtained results allow us to distinguish seven complexity classes of infinite

an effective interaction between basis states defined without mass terms and a
scalar potential associated with the Higgs boson. In the relativistic field
theory that underlies the SM, mass itself, understood as the Lorentz-invariant
squared 4-momentum of a particle or field, is fixed a priori, imposing a
constraint on possible momentum states. Stueckelberg introduced an alternative
approach, positing antiparticles as particles evolving backward in time, thus
relaxing the mass shell constraint for individual particles. Further work by
Piron and Horwitz established a covariant Hamiltonian mechanics on an
unconstrained 8D phase space, leading to a gauge field theory that mediates the
exchange of mass between particles, while the total mass of particles and
fields remains conserved. In a recently developed extension of general
relativity, consistent with this approach, the spacetime metric evolves in a
manner that permits the exchange of mass across spacetime through the
gravitational field. Mechanisms that restrict mass exchange between particles
have also been identified. Nevertheless, mass exchange remains possible under
certain circumstances and may have phenomenological implications in particle
physics and cosmology.

categories as news, irrelevant, anti-vaccine, and vaccine supporters, the model

intervals in which anti-vaccine tweets are concentrated, the categories to

free-floating planets toward their home planetary systems. Cosmic Hitchhikers
may also ride objects native to the outer regions of their planetary systems,
which become free-floating planets when ejected by astronomical engineering or
by their stars during the asymptotic giant branch evolution. During
interstellar travel, Cosmic Hitchhikers may apply astronomical engineering to
steer their free-floating planets toward the planetary systems of their choice.
Whereas riding free-floating planets may not save travel time, it avoids the
technical challenges of interstellar spacecraft transporting large populations.
Each civilization of Cosmic Hitchhikers may colonize several planetary systems.
Its colonies may grow into autonomous civilizations, changing the number of

method for rare event estimation. SDIS expresses a small failure probability in
terms of a sequence of auxiliary failure probabilities, defined by magnifying
the input variability. The first probability in the sequence is estimated with
Monte Carlo simulation in Cartesian coordinates, and all the subsequent ones
are computed with directional importance sampling in polar coordinates. Samples
from the directional importance sampling densities used to estimate the
intermediate probabilities are drawn in a sequential manner through a
resample-move scheme. The latter is conveniently performed in Cartesian
coordinates and directional samples are obtained through a suitable
transformation. For the move step, we discuss two Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) algorithms for application in low and high-dimensional problems.
Finally, an adaptive choice of the parameters defining the intermediate failure
probabilities is proposed and the resulting coefficient of variation of the
failure probability estimate is analyzed. The proposed SDIS method is tested on
five examples in various problem settings, which demonstrate that the method
outperforms existing sequential sampling reliability methods.

example of univariate time series of chosen features of the dynamics of mucin,
which interact with chondroitin sulfate (4 and 6) in four different saline
solutions. Our statistical approach is based on recurrence methods to analyze
chosen features of molecular dynamics. Such recurrence methods are usually
applied to reconstruct the evolution of a molecular system in its reduced phase
space, where the most important variables in the process are taken into
account. In detail, the analyzed time-series are spitted onto sub-series of
records that are expected to carry meaningful information about the system of
molecules. Elements of sub-series are splinted by the constant delay-time lag
(that is the parameter determined by statistical testing in our case), and the
length of sub-series is the embedded dimension parameter (using the Cao
method). We use the recurrent plots approach combined with the Shannon entropy
approach to analyze the robustness of the sub-series determination. We
hypothesize that the robustness of the sub-series determines some specifics of
the dynamics of the system of molecules. We analyze rather highly noised
features to demonstrate that such features lead to recurrence plots that
graphically look similar. From the recurrence plots, the Shannon entropy has
been computed. We have, however, demonstrated that the Shannon entropy value is
highly dependent on the delay time value for analyzed features. Hence,
elaboration of a more precise method of the recurrence plot analysis is
required. For this reason, we suggest the random walk method that can be
applied to analyze the recurrence plots automatically.
