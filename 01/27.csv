assisting ophthalmologists in diagnosis. Although many researches have been
conducted on this task, most prior works paid too much attention to the designs
of networks instead of considering the pathological association for lesions.
Through investigating the pathogenic causes of DR lesions in advance, we found
that certain lesions are closed to specific vessels and present relative
patterns to each other. Motivated by the observation, we propose a relation
transformer block (RTB) to incorporate attention mechanisms at two main levels:
a self-attention transformer exploits global dependencies among lesion
features, while a cross-attention transformer allows interactions between
lesion and vessel features by integrating valuable vascular information to
alleviate ambiguity in lesion detection caused by complex fundus structures. In
addition, to capture the small lesion patterns first, we propose a global
transformer block (GTB) which preserves detailed information in deep network.
By integrating the above blocks of dual-branches, our network segments the four
kinds of lesions simultaneously. Comprehensive experiments on IDRiD and DDR
datasets well demonstrate the superiority of our approach, which achieves
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-arts.

mechanics, which have fascinated scientists since their discoveries roughly a
century ago. Ever since the initial theories of such quantum fluids were
formulated, there has been speculation as to the possibility of multi-component
quantum order. A particularly simple multi-component condensate is built from
particles occupying different quantum states, or bands, prior to condensation.
The particles in one or both bands may undergo condensation, as seen for
certain solids and anticipated for certain cold atom systems. For bulk solids,
the different bands always order simultaneously, with conventional pairing
characterized by complex order parameters describing the condensates in each
band. Another type of condensate, notably occurring at room temperature, has
been identified for magnons, the magnetic analogue of lattice vibrations,
injected by microwaves into yttrium iron garnet. Here we show that magnon
quantization for thin samples results in a new multi-band magnon condensate. We
establish a phase diagram, as a function of microwave drive power and frequency
relative to the magnon bands, revealing both single and multi-band
condensation. The most stable multi-band condensate is found in a narrow regime
favoured on account of a resonance in the scattering between two bands. Our
discovery introduces a flexible non-equilibrium platform operating at room
temperature for a well-characterised material, exploiting a Feshbach-like
resonance, for examining multi-band phenomena. It points to qualitatively new
ways to engineer and control condensates and superconducting states in
multiband systems and potential devices containing multiple interacting

galaxies that have long since merged with the Milky Way. When these globular
clusters are susceptible to tidal disruption, this process likely starts
already inside the parent satellite leading to an early stellar stream within
the satellite. When the parent satellite merges with the Milky Way, the
globular cluster and its pre-merger stellar stream are accreted in a somewhat
chaotic process. Here, we investigate the properties of the accreted stream
after the merger as we would see it today using a suite of simulations of
accretion events. We find that the accretion process leads to a wide range of
behaviors, but generally scatters the accreted stream over a wide,
two-dimensional area of the sky. The behavior ranges from a set of a few or
more well-defined ""sub-streams"" extending out from the post-merger thin stream
by tens of degrees, to more widely dispersed debris over much of the sky,
depending on how close to the center of the MilkyWay the merger happened. Using
mock Gaia-like observations of the simulated streams, we demonstrate that an
accreted-stream component can explain the off-track features observed in the
GD-1 stream. Sub-streams can appear like thin tidal streams themselves that are
seemingly unassociated with the post-merger stream, raising the possibility

a single or a few accreted streams created in an ancient merger event.

noise factors, which can be mitigated by classical post-processing called
quantum readout error mitigation (QREM). The standard QREM method applies the
inverse of noise calibration matrix to the outcome probability distribution
using exponential computational resources to the system size. Hence this
standard approach is not applicable to the current quantum devices with tens of
qubits and more. We propose two efficient QREM methods on such devices whose
computational complexity is $O(ns^2)$ for probability distributions on
measuring $n$ qubits with $s$ shots. The main targets of the proposed methods
are the sparse probability distributions where only a few states are dominant.
We compare the proposed methods with several recent QREM methods on the
following three cases: expectation values of GHZ state, its fidelities, and the
estimation error of maximum likelihood amplitude estimation (MLAE) algorithm
with modified Grover iterator. The two cases of the GHZ state are on real IBM
quantum devices, while the third is by numerical simulation. The proposed
methods can be applied to mitigate GHZ states up to 65 qubits on IBM Quantum
devices within a few seconds to confirm the existence of a 29-qubit GHZ state
with fidelity larger than 0.5. The proposed methods also succeed in the
estimation of the amplitude in MLAE with the modified Grover operator where

persistent negative effects on their earnings, health, and other outcomes. This
paper investigates whether students delay graduation to avoid these effects.
Using data on the universe of students in higher education in Brazil and
leveraging variation in labor market conditions across time, space, and chosen
majors, the paper finds that students in public institutions delay graduation
to avoid entering depressed labor markets. A typical recession causes the
on-time graduation rate to fall by 6.5% in public universities and there is no
effect on private institutions. The induced delaying increases average
graduation by 0.11 semesters, consistent with 1 out of 18 students delaying
graduation by one year in public universities. The delaying effect is larger
for students with higher scores, in higher-earnings majors, and from more
advantaged backgrounds. This has important implications for the distributional
impact of recessions.

energetic nuclear optical outburst. We present a detailed analysis of its
multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations covering a period
of decade since outburst. We detect mid-infrared (MIR) flares delayed by about
two months relative to the optical outburst, with an extremely high peak
luminosity of log(L_4.6um)>44 erg/s. The MIR peak luminosity is at least an
order of magnitude higher than any known supernovae explosions, suggesting the
optical outburst might be due to a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE). We
find late-time X-ray brightening by a factor of >30 with respect to what is
observed about 100 days after the optical outburst peak, followed by a flux
fading by a factor of ~4 within two weeks, making it one of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGNs) with extreme variability. Despite the dramatic X-ray variability,
there are no coincident strong flux variations in optical, UV and MIR bands.
This unusual variability behavior has been seen in other highly accreting AGNs
and could be attributed to absorption variability. In this scenario, the
decrease in the covering factor of absorber with accretion rate could cause the
X-ray brightening, possibly induced by the TDE. Most strikingly, while the
UV/optical continuum remains little changes with time, an evident enhancement
in the flux of H_alpha broad emission line is observed, about a decade after
the nuclear optical outburst, which is an anomalous behavior never seen in any
other AGNs. Such an H_alpha anomaly could be explained by the replenishment of
gas clouds and excitation within Broad Line Region (BLR) that originates,
perhaps from the interaction of outflowing stellar debris with BLR. The results
highlight the importance of late-time evolution of TDE that could affect the
accreting properties of AGN, as suggested by recent simulations.

with each lasting for several years. The most recent X-ray outburst is observed
on 2018, with a substantial increase of 2--10 keV flux by a factor of ~24 than
the historical minimum. We re-analyze the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations
covering the pre-outburst, outburst and post-outburst epochs, and confirm the
discovery of the broad feature in the ~5--7 keV band during the period of

Our analysis suggests that its flux has increased in tandem with the 2--10 keV
continuum, making it the second changing look AGN in which the broad Fe K_alpha
line responds to the X-ray continuum variability. This behavior strongly
supports the idea that X-rays originates in a corona above the accretion disk,
and disk reflection produces the relativistic Fe K_alpha line. In addition, we
find the response of narrow Fe K_alpha emission line to the changes in the
X-ray continuum on a time-scale as short as four months, allowing to put the
location of line-emitting region at <0.1 pc, comparable to the size of optical
BLR. By comparing to the changing look AGN NGC 2992, the Fe K_alpha variation
rate (the ratio of Fe K_alpha variation to luminosity variation) in NGC 1566
appears greater, which could be possibly explained by larger amount of gas or
Fe abundance responsible for producing the Fe K_alpha line for the latter. The
strength of variable broad Fe K_alpha line as well as the soft X-ray excess
emission appears to be correlated with the accretion rate, which could be
explained as due to the state transition associated with the changing-look

compensated reviews), expecting to increase the volume of their non-compensated
reviews and overall rating. Does this strategy work? On what subjects or topics
does this strategy work the best? These questions have still not been answered
in the literature but draw substantial interest from the industry. In this
paper, we study the effect of compensated reviews on non-compensated reviews by
utilizing online reviews on 1,240 auto shipping companies over a ten-year
period from a transportation website. Because some online reviews have missing
information on their compensation status, we first develop a classification
algorithm to differentiate compensated reviews from non-compensated reviews by
leveraging a machine learning-based identification process, drawing upon the
unique features of the compensated reviews. From the classification results, we
empirically investigate the effects of compensated reviews on non-compensated.
Our results indicate that the number of compensated reviews does indeed
increase the number of non-compensated reviews. In addition, the ratings of
compensated reviews positively affect the ratings of non-compensated reviews.
Moreover, if the compensated reviews feature the topic or subject of a car
shipping function, the positive effect of compensated reviews on
non-compensated ones is the strongest. Besides methodological contributions in
text classification and empirical modeling, our study provides empirical
evidence on how to prove the effectiveness of compensated online reviews in
terms of improving the platform's overall online reviews and ratings. Also, it
suggests a guideline for utilizing compensated reviews to their full strength,
that is, with regard to featuring certain topics or subjects in these reviews

transverse static modes are the eigenmodes with zero surface divergence of the

The static modes expansion allows the regularization of the singular integral

efficiently at high frequencies. Structural resonance is thought to play a role
in ensuring efficient motor operation, but the details of this role are
elusive. While the efficiency benefits associated with resonance may be
significant, a range of counterintuitive behaviours are observed. In
particular, the relationship between insect wingbeat frequencies and thoracic
natural frequencies are uncertain, with insects showing wingbeat frequency
modulation over both short and long timescales. Here, we offer new explanations
for this modulation. We show how, in linear and nonlinear models of an indirect
flight motor, resonance is not a unitary state at a single frequency; but a
complex cluster of distinct and mutually-exclusive states, each representing a
different form of resonant optimality. Additionally, by characterising the
relationship between resonance and the state of negative work absorption within
the motor, we demonstrate how near-perfect negative work absorption can be
maintained over significant wingbeat frequency ranges. Our analysis leads to a
new conceptual model of flight motor operation: one in which insects are
indifferent to their precise wingbeat frequency, and robust to changes in
thoracic and environmental properties - illustrating the extraordinary
robustness of these natural motors.

learning. Our results are the first to show that the widely popular heuristic
of scaling the client updates with an extra parameter is very useful in the
context of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with local passes over the client data.
Each local pass is performed without replacement using Random Reshuffling,
which is a key reason we can show improved complexities. In particular, we
prove that whenever the local stepsizes are small, and the update direction is
given by FedAvg in conjunction with Random Reshuffling over all clients, one
can take a big leap in the obtained direction and improve rates for convex,
strongly convex, and non-convex objectives. In particular, in non-convex regime
we get an enhancement of the rate of convergence from
$\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-3}\right)$ to
$\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-2}\right)$. This result is new even for Random
Reshuffling performed on a single node. In contrast, if the local stepsizes are
large, we prove that the noise of client sampling can be controlled by using a
small server-side stepsize. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that local steps provably help to overcome the communication bottleneck.
Together, our results on the advantage of large and small server-side stepsizes
give a formal justification for the practice of adaptive server-side
optimization in federated learning. Moreover, we consider a variant of our

  Symposium",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the growth of 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and cloud
computing technologies, the infrastructure (compute and network) available to
emerging applications (AR/VR, autonomous driving, industry 4.0, etc.) has
become quite complex. There are multiple tiers of computing (IoT devices, near
edge, far edge, cloud, etc.) that are connected with different types of
networking technologies (LAN, LTE, 5G, MAN, WAN, etc.). Deployment and
management of applications in such an environment is quite challenging. In this
paper, we propose ROMA, which performs resource orchestration for
microservices-based 5G applications in a dynamic, heterogeneous, multi-tiered
compute and network fabric. We assume that only application-level requirements
are known, and the detailed requirements of the individual microservices in the
application are not specified. As part of our solution, ROMA identifies and
leverages the coupling relationship between compute and network usage for
various microservices and solves an optimization problem in order to
appropriately identify how each microservice should be deployed in the complex,
multi-tiered compute and network fabric, so that the end-to-end application
requirements are optimally met. We implemented two real-world 5G applications
in video surveillance and intelligent transportation system (ITS) domains.
Through extensive experiments, we show that ROMA is able to save up to 90%, 55%
and 44% compute and up to 80%, 95% and 75% network bandwidth for the
surveillance (watchlist) and transportation application (person and car
detection), respectively. This improvement is achieved while honoring the
application performance requirements, and it is over an alternative scheme that
employs a static and overprovisioned resource allocation strategy by ignoring
the resource coupling relationships.

theoretical example of the mechanism that can drive the electromagnetic
extraction of energy from Kerr black holes. It is constructed as a perturbative
low spin solution of Force Free Electrodynamics (FFE). Recently, Armas $et~al.$
put this construction on a firmer footing by clearing up issues with apparent
divergent asymptotics. This was accomplished by resolving the behavior around
the outer light surface, a critical surface of the FFE equations. Building on
this, we revisit the BZ perturbative expansion, and extend the perturbative
approach to higher orders in the spin parameter of the Kerr black hole. We
employ matched-asymptotic-expansions and semi-analytic techniques to extend the
split-monopole solution to the sixth-order in perturbation theory. The
expansion necessarily includes novel logarithmic contributions in the spin
parameter. We show that these higher order terms result in non-analytic
contributions to the power and angular momentum output. In particular, we
compute for the first time the perturbative contributions to the energy
extraction at seventh- and eighth-order in the spin parameter. The resulting
formula for the energy extraction improves the agreement with numerical
simulations at finite spin. Moreover, we present a novel numerical procedure
for resolving the FFE equations across the outer light surface, resulting in
significantly faster convergence and greater accuracy, and extend this to
higher orders as well. Finally, we include a general discussion of light
surfaces as critical surfaces of the FFE equations.

two baseline runs that use BM25) plus the set of TREC-8 submissions that did

continue this line of investigation focusing on theories with tensor matter. In
such cases one can apply the idea of deconfinement, which consists of trading
the tensor matter for extra gauge nodes by means of a suitable elementary
duality. This gives an auxiliary dual frame which can then be manipulated with
further dualizations, in an iterative procedure eventually yielding an
interesting dual description of the original theory. The sequential

and the compression pressure forcing the model to compress concepts into
retained channels. We apply \acosp to \segnet and \pspnet architectures and
show its success when trained on the \camvid, \city, \voc, and \ade datasets.
The results are competitive with existing baselines for compression of
segmentation models at low compression ratios and outperform them significantly
at high compression ratios, yielding acceptable results even when removing more
than $93\%$ of the parameters. In addition, \acosp is conceptually simple, easy
to implement, and can readily be generalized to other data modalities, tasks,

open up a different regime of applications where path-augmentation (by

imprint vorticity onto the 2D Airy modes. By means of systematic simulations,
we examine interactions between truncated Airy waves originally carried by
different fundamental-frequency components which are bending in opposite
directions, through the second-harmonic field. The interaction leads to fusion
of the input into a pair of narrow solitons. This is opposed to what happens in
the 1D system, where the interacting Airy waves split into a large number of

structure in recordings from retinal neurons, but it can be widely applied to
discover and model latent structure in noisy binary data. In the context of
spiking neural data, the task is to ""explain"" spikes of individual neurons in
terms of groups of neurons, ""Cell Assemblies"" (CAs), that often fire together,
due to mutual interactions or other causes. The model infers sparse activity in
a set of binary latent variables, each describing the activity of a cell
assembly. When the latent variable of a cell assembly is active, it reduces the
probabilities of neurons belonging to this assembly to be inactive. The
conditional probability kernels of the latent components are learned from the
data in an expectation maximization scheme, involving inference of latent
states and parameter adjustments to the model. We thoroughly validate the model
on synthesized spike trains constructed to statistically resemble recorded

cost, memory, and power consumption are attained. To that end, we generalize a
post-training neural-network quantization method, GPFQ, that is based on a
greedy path-following mechanism. Among other things, we propose modifications
to promote sparsity of the weights, and rigorously analyze the associated
error. Additionally, our error analysis expands the results of previous work on
GPFQ to handle general quantization alphabets, showing that for quantizing a
single-layer network, the relative square error essentially decays linearly in
the number of weights -- i.e., level of over-parametrization. Our result holds
across a range of input distributions and for both fully-connected and

further improve accuracy.

perceptual, structural, or semantic features of inputs. In computer vision,
techniques exist for identifying neurons that respond to individual concept
categories like colors, textures, and object classes. But these techniques are
limited in scope, labeling only a small subset of neurons and behaviors in any
network. Is a richer characterization of neuron-level computation possible? We
introduce a procedure (called MILAN, for mutual-information-guided linguistic
annotation of neurons) that automatically labels neurons with open-ended,
compositional, natural language descriptions. Given a neuron, MILAN generates a
description by searching for a natural language string that maximizes pointwise
mutual information with the image regions in which the neuron is active. MILAN
produces fine-grained descriptions that capture categorical, relational, and
logical structure in learned features. These descriptions obtain high agreement
with human-generated feature descriptions across a diverse set of model
architectures and tasks, and can aid in understanding and controlling learned
models. We highlight three applications of natural language neuron
descriptions. First, we use MILAN for analysis, characterizing the distribution
and importance of neurons selective for attribute, category, and relational
information in vision models. Second, we use MILAN for auditing, surfacing
neurons sensitive to human faces in datasets designed to obscure them. Finally,
we use MILAN for editing, improving robustness in an image classifier by
deleting neurons sensitive to text features spuriously correlated with class
labels.

of textual claim veracity w.r.t. a corpus of trusted ground truths. We attempt
to collect sets of data in form of a factual claim, evidence within the ground

As a first attempt, we generate a Czech version of the large-scale FEVER
dataset built on top of Wikipedia corpus. We take a hybrid approach of machine
translation and document alignment; the approach and the tools we provide can
be easily applied to other languages. We discuss its weaknesses and
inaccuracies, propose a future approach for their cleaning and publish the 127k
resulting translations, as well as a version of such dataset reliably
applicable for the Natural Language Inference task - the CsFEVER-NLI.
Furthermore, we collect a novel dataset of 3,097 claims, which is annotated
using the corpus of 2.2M articles of Czech News Agency. We present its extended
annotation methodology based on the FEVER approach, and, as the underlying
corpus is kept a trade secret, we also publish a standalone version of the

analyze both acquired datasets for spurious cues - annotation patterns leading
to model overfitting. CTKFacts is further examined for inter-annotator
agreement, thoroughly cleaned, and a typology of common annotator errors is
extracted. Finally, we provide baseline models for all stages of the
fact-checking pipeline and publish the NLI datasets, as well as our annotation

determine the preferred surface for the pixelisation of the crystal, and
perform test measurements with the prototypes to provide feedback for further

accumulated revealing tidal tails and bridges made up of gas, stars and star

starting to emerge with a 6D phase-space map plus age and metallicity using
star clusters as tracers. In this work, we continue our analysis of another
outer region of the SMC, the so-called West Halo, and combined it with the
previously analysed Northern Bridge. We use both structures to define the
Bridge and Counter-bridge trailing and leading tidal tails. These two
structures are moving away from each other, roughly in the SMC-LMC direction.
The West Halo form a ring around the SMC inner regions that goes up to the
background of the Northern Bridge shaping an extended layer of the
Counter-bridge. Four old Bridge clusters were identified at distances larger
than 8 kpc from the SMC centre moving towards the LMC, which is consistent with
the SMC-LMC closest distance of 7.5 kpc when the Magellanic Bridge was formed
about 150Myr ago; this shows that the Magellanic Bridge was not formed only by
pulled gas, but it also removed older stars from the SMC during its formation.
We also found age and metallicity radial gradients using projected distances on
sky, which are vanished when we use the real 3D distances.

the upper atmosphere of exoplanets and tracing possible mass loss. Here, we
analysed one transit of GJ\,1214\,b observed with the CARMENES high-resolution
spectrograph to study its atmosphere via transmission spectroscopy around the
$\ion{He}{I}$ triplet. Although previous studies using lower resolution
instruments have reported non-detections of $\ion{He}{I}$ in the atmosphere of
GJ\,1214\,b, we report here the first potential detection. We reconcile the
conflicting results arguing that previous transit observations did not present
good opportunities for the detection of $\ion{He}{I}$, due to telluric H$_2$O
absorption and OH emission contamination.We simulated those earlier
observations, and show evidence that the planetary signal was contaminated.
From our single non-telluric-contaminated transit, we determined an excess
absorption of 2.10$^{+0.45}_{-0.50}$\,\% (4.6\,$\sigma$) with a full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of 1.30$^{+0.30}_{-0.25}$\,\AA. The detection of
\ion{He}{I} is statistically significant at the 4.6\,$\sigma$ level, but
repeatability of the detection could not be confirmed due to the availability
of only one transit. By applying a hydrodynamical model and assuming an H/He
composition of 98/2, we found that GJ\,1214\,b would undergo hydrodynamic
escape in the photon-limited regime, losing its primary atmosphere with a
mass-loss rate of (1.5--18)\,$\times$\,10$^{10}$\,g\,s$^{-1}$ and an outflow
temperature in the range of 2900--4400\,K. Our $\ion{He}{I}$ excess absorption
is the first tentative detection of a chemical species in the atmosphere of

Conservative upper limits are presented on the fraction of stars at G $\leq$ 21

increased confusion with naturally occurring sources of strong mid-infrared

progress on quantum technologies leads to a promising scalable platform for
realizing quantum computation, conducted by preparing a large-scale graph state
over many qubits and performing single-qubit measurements on the state. With
fault-tolerant MBQC, even if the graph-state preparation suffers from errors
occurring at an unknown physical error rate, we can suppress the effect of the
errors. Verifying graph states is vital to test whether we can conduct MBQC as
desired even with such errors. However, problematically, existing
state-of-the-art protocols for graph-state verification by fidelity estimation
have required measurements on many copies of the entire graph state and hence
have been prohibitively costly in terms of the number of qubits and the
runtime. We here construct an efficient alternative framework for testing graph
states for fault-tolerant MBQC based on the theory of property testing. Our
test protocol accepts with high probability when the physical error rate is
small enough to make fault-tolerant MBQC feasible and rejects when the rate is
above the threshold of fault-tolerant MBQC. The novelty of our protocol is that
we use only a single copy of the $N$-qubit graph state and single-qubit Pauli
measurements only on a constant-sized subset of the qubits; thus, the protocol
has a constant runtime independently of $N$. Furthermore, we can immediately
use the rest of the graph state for fault-tolerant MBQC if the protocol
accepts. These results achieve a significant advantage over prior art for
graph-state verification in the number of qubits and the total runtime.
Consequently, our work offers a new route to a fast and practical framework for
benchmarking large-scale quantum state preparation.

structure will ultimately collapse to within the horizons of a set of black
holes, and as a result, an external classical observer will be unable to probe
it. However a single two-level quantum system (UDW detector) that remains
outside of the horizon has been shown to distinguish between a black hole and
its associated geon counterpart via its different response rates. Here we
extend this investigation of the quantum vacuum outside of an $\mathbb{RP}_2$
geon by considering the entanglement structure of the vacuum state of a quantum
scalar field in this spacetime, and how this differs from its BTZ black hole
counterpart. Employing the entanglement harvesting protocol, where field
entanglement is swapped to a pair of UDW detectors, we find that the
classically hidden topology of the geon can have an appreciable difference in
the amount of entanglement harvested in the two spacetimes for sufficiently
small mass. In this regime, we find that detectors with a small energy gap
harvest more entanglement in the BTZ spacetime; however as the energy gap
increases, the detectors harvest more entanglement in a geon spacetime. The
energy gap at the crossover is dependent on the black hole mass, occurring at a
lower values for lower masses. This also impacts the size of the entanglement
shadow, the region near the horizon where the detectors cannot harvest
entanglement. Small gap detectors experience a larger entanglement shadow in a
geon spacetime, whereas for large gap detectors the shadow is larger in a BTZ
spacetime.

optimized these models for accelerated inference using NVIDIA TensorRT. We
deployed our inference-optimized AI ensemble in the ThetaGPU supercomputer at
Argonne Leadership Computer Facility to conduct distributed inference. Using
the entire ThetaGPU supercomputer, consisting of 20 nodes each of which has 8
NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs and 2 AMD Rome CPUs, our NVIDIA TensorRT-optimized
AI ensemble processed an entire month of advanced LIGO data (including Hanford
and Livingston data streams) within 50 seconds. Our inference-optimized AI
ensemble retains the same sensitivity of traditional AI models, namely, it
identifies all known binary black hole mergers previously identified in this
advanced LIGO dataset and reports no misclassifications, while also providing a
3X inference speedup compared to traditional artificial intelligence models. We
used time slides to quantify the performance of our AI ensemble to process up
to 5 years worth of advanced LIGO data. In this synthetically enhanced dataset,
our AI ensemble reports an average of one misclassification for every month of
searched advanced LIGO data. We also present the receiver operating
characteristic curve of our AI ensemble using this 5 year long advanced LIGO

multi-epoch ugriz photometry from the SDSS Southern Survey. By fitting a
separable linear model to each quasar's spectral variations, we decompose their
five-band spectral energy distributions into variable (disc) and non-variable
(host galaxy) components. In modelling the disc spectra, we include attenuation
by dust on the line of sight through the host galaxy to its nucleus. We
consider five commonly used attenuation laws, and find that the best
description is by dust similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud, inferring
a lack of carbonaceous grains from the relatively weak 2175AA absorption
feature. We go on to construct a composite spectrum for the quasar variations
spanning 700 to 8000AA. By varying the assumed power-law
$L_{\nu}\propto\nu^\alpha$ spectral slope, we find a best-fit value
$\alpha=0.71\pm0.02$, excluding at high confidence the canonical
$L_{\nu}\propto\nu^{1/3}$ prediction for a steady-state accretion disc with a
$T\propto r^{-3/4}$ temperature profile. The bluer spectral index of the
observed quasar variations instead supports the model of Mummery & Balbus in
which a steeper temperature profile, $T\propto r^{-7/8}$, develops as a result
of finite magnetically-induced stress at the innermost stable circular orbit
extracting energy and angular momentum from the black hole spin.

Submitted",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ac5822",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observations of pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) give evidence that more
>10-20% of neutron stars (NSs) ever formed in GCs were retained there. However,
the velocity distribution of field pulsars peaks at 5-10 times the escape
velocities of GCs. Consequently, only a small fraction of GC-NSs should have
been retained, even accounting for low-velocity NSs formed through
electron-capture supernovae. Thus, too few low-velocity NSs should have been
retained in GCs, giving rise to the NS retention problem in GCs. Here we
suggest a novel solution, in which the progenitors of most GC-NSs were ONe
white-dwarfs (WDs) that accreted ambient intra-cluster gas and formed
low-velocity NSs through accretion induced collapse (AIC). The existence of an
early gas-enriched environment in GCs is supported by observations of GC
multiple stellar populations. It is thought that 10s-100s of Myrs after the
formation of the first generation of stars, and after ONe-WDs were already
formed, GCs were replenished with gas which formed a second generation of
stars. Accretion of such replenished gas onto the ONe-WDs catalyzed the AIC
processes. The number of AIC-formed NSs is then sufficient to explain the large
number of NSs retained in GCs. Similar processes might also drive CO-WDs to
produce type-Ia SNe or to merge and form NSs, and similarly drive NSs to AIC
and mergers producing BHs. Moreover, the wide variety of gas-catalyzed binary
mergers and explosive transients suggest to occur in the gas-rich environments
of AGN disk could similarly, and even more efficiently, occur in
second-generation gas in GCs.

known isolated intra-cluster cloud detected in X-ray, H$\alpha$, and CO
emission. We found a total of about $2.2\times 10^8 M_\odot$ of H$_2$ with the
IRAM 30-m telescope in two regions, one associated with the peak of H$\alpha$
emission and another with the peak of X-ray emission surrounded by weak
H$\alpha$ filaments. The velocity of the molecular gas is offset from the
underlying H$\alpha$ emission by > 100 km s$^{-1}$ in the region where the
X-ray peaks. The molecular gas may account for about 10% of the total cloud's
mass, which is dominated by the hot X-ray component. The previously measured
upper limit on the star formation rate in the cloud indicates that the
molecular component is in a non-star-forming state, possibly due to a
combination of low density of the gas and the observed level of velocity
dispersion. The presence of the three gas phases associated with the cloud
suggests that gas phase mixing with the surrounding intra-cluster medium is
taking place. The possible origin of the orphan cloud is a late evolutionary
stage of a ram pressure stripping event. In contrast, the nearby ram pressure

large datasets in well-established domains. However, low-resource settings such
as new and emerging domains would especially benefit from reliable question
answering systems. Furthermore, multilingual and cross-lingual resources in
emergent domains are scarce, leading to few or no such systems. In this paper,
we demonstrate a cross-lingual open-retrieval question answering system for the
emergent domain of COVID-19. Our system adopts a corpus of scientific articles
to ensure that retrieved documents are reliable. To address the scarcity of
cross-lingual training data in emergent domains, we present a method utilizing
automatic translation, alignment, and filtering to produce English-to-all
datasets. We show that a deep semantic retriever greatly benefits from training
on our English-to-all data and significantly outperforms a BM25 baseline in the
cross-lingual setting. We illustrate the capabilities of our system with
examples and release all code necessary to train and deploy such a system.

systems from a discourse coherence perspective, e.g., modeling the
interdependence between sentences. Still, recent BERT-based evaluation metrics
are weak in recognizing coherence, and thus are not reliable in a way to spot
the discourse-level improvements of those text generation systems. In this
work, we introduce DiscoScore, a parametrized discourse metric, which uses BERT
to model discourse coherence from different perspectives, driven by Centering
theory. Our experiments encompass 16 non-discourse and discourse metrics,
including DiscoScore and popular coherence models, evaluated on summarization
and document-level machine translation (MT). We find that (i) the majority of
BERT-based metrics correlate much worse with human rated coherence than early
discourse metrics, invented a decade ago; (ii) the recent state-of-the-art
BARTScore is weak when operated at system level -- which is particularly
problematic as systems are typically compared in this manner. DiscoScore, in
contrast, achieves strong system-level correlation with human ratings, not only
in coherence but also in factual consistency and other aspects, and surpasses
BARTScore by over 10 correlation points on average. Further, aiming to
understand DiscoScore, we provide justifications to the importance of discourse
coherence for evaluation metrics, and explain the superiority of one variant
over another. Our code is available at

the discovery of Cooper multiplets, in which the splitting of a Cooper pair is
enabled via a series of Andreev reflections that entangle four (or more)

also emerge as a consequence of the three terminal circuit model. The
supercurrent appears due to the correlated phase dynamics at values that
correspond to the multiplet condition $nV_1 = -mV_2$ of applied bias. The
emergence of multiplet resonances is seen in i) a nanofabricated three-terminal
graphene Josephson junction, ii) an analog three terminal Josephson junction

state of the system under those conditions is purely dynamical, and a close
analog to Kapitza's inverted pendulum problem. We describe parameter
considerations that best optimize the detection of the multiplet lines both for
design of future devices. Further, these supercurrents have a classically
robust $\cos2\phi$ energy contribution, which can be used to engineer qubits

well for simpler informational needs, we argue that searcher models need to be
developed further to allow for the decomposition of a complex search task into
multiple aspects. As no searcher model yet exists that considers both aspects
and the SAL domain, we propose, by augmenting the Complex Searcher Model (CSM),
the Subtopic Aware Complex Searcher Model (SACSM) - modelling aspects as
subtopics to the user's need. We then instantiate several agents (i.e.,
simulated users), with different subtopic selection strategies, which can be
considered as different prototypical learning strategies (e.g., should I deeply
examine one subtopic at a time, or shallowly cover several subtopics?).
Finally, we report on the first large-scale simulated analysis of user
behaviours in the SAL domain. Results demonstrate that the SACSM, under certain

UGe2 is a 5f heavy fermion system, where the Kondo hybridization is interrupted
by the formation of two ferromagnetic phases below a 2nd order transition Tc ~

concomitantly related to a spin-triplet superconductivity that only emerges and
persists inside the magnetically ordered phase at high pressure. The origin of

Kondo resonance and sharp 5f-electron states near the chemical potential that
form at high temperatures above Tc in accordance with our density functional

follow-up question: ""Assuming that we only consider the tasks where attention
weights correlate well with feature importance, how effective are these
attention based explanations in increasing human trust and reliance in the

suitable in increasing human trust and reliance. Our experiment results show
that attention cannot be used as an explanation.

processing preferable close to this wavelength. The impact of the nonlinear
nonparaxial propagation effects on spatio-temporal beam structure is also
investigated. It could be shown that with increasing wavelength and large

terms of convergence rate and accuracy, such as momentum-based SGD (mSGD) and
adaptive gradient algorithm (AdaGrad). Despite these empirical successes, the
theoretical properties of these algorithms have not been well established due
to technical difficulties. With this motivation, we focus on convergence
analysis of mSGD and AdaGrad for any smooth (possibly non-convex) loss
functions in stochastic optimization. First, we prove that the iterates of mSGD
are asymptotically convergent to a connected set of stationary points with
probability one, which is more general than existing works on subsequence
convergence or convergence of time averages. Moreover, we prove that the loss
function of mSGD decays at a certain rate faster than that of SGD. In addition,
we prove the iterates of AdaGrad are asymptotically convergent to a connected
set of stationary points with probability one. Also, this result extends the
results from the literature on subsequence convergence and the convergence of
time averages. Despite the generality of the above convergence results, we have

generation of tabular data, exploiting decades-old understanding of the
supervised task's best components for DT induction, from losses (properness),
models (tree-based) to algorithms (boosting). The \textit{properness} condition
on the supervised loss -- which postulates the optimality of Bayes rule --
leads us to a variational GAN-style loss formulation which is \textit{tight}
when discriminators meet a calibration property trivially satisfied by DTs,
and, under common assumptions about the supervised loss, yields ""one loss to

tree-based generative models, \textit{generative trees} (GTs), meant to mirror
on the generative side the good properties of DTs for classifying tabular data,
with a boosting-compliant \textit{adversarial} training algorithm for GTs. We
also introduce \textit{copycat training}, in which the generator copies at run

the hardest discriminative task, with boosting compliant convergence. We test
our algorithms on tasks including fake/real distinction, training from fake

provide comparatively simple -- and interpretable -- contenders to

difficult problem than reward-aware (PAC) RL -- where the agent has access to
the reward function during exploration -- with optimal sample complexities in
the two settings differing by a factor of $|\mathcal{S}|$, the size of the

reward-free RL in a $d$-dimensional linear MDP with sample complexity scaling

gauge the effects on temperatures, luminosities, and lifetimes in various
phases. Individual elements C, N, O, Mg, Si, and Fe were included. Most of the
effect relevant to integrated light models is contained in the temperature
variable, as opposed to the timescale or luminosity. We derive a recipe for
including abundance-sensitive temperature effects that is applicable to
existing isochrone grids. The resultant enhanced isochrones are incorporated
into composite stellar population models and compared with galaxy data from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A severe oxygen-age degeneracy is apparent, 2 - 3 Gyr
per 0.1 dex in [O/R], where R represents a heavy element such as Fe. Over the
range of early-type galaxy velocity dispersion, the spans of all abundance
ratios are reduced but the age range increases, systematically older. Allowing
Fe-peak elements the freedom to vary accentuates this increase of age span.
Overall, these results sharpen the age-mass correlation known as downsizing but
decrease the steepness of abundance ratio gradients. Both of these
observations, in turn, imply a more robust contribution from gas free mergers
in the histories of typical elliptical galaxies.

techniques with a graph representation learning substrate based on the
versatile Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model. We consider efficient, online
updates of a judicious monitoring function, which quantifies the discrepancy
between the streaming graph observations and the nominal RDPG. This reference
distribution is inferred via spectral embeddings of the first few graphs in the
sequence. We characterize the distribution of this running statistic to select
thresholds that guarantee error-rate control, and under simplifying
approximations we offer insights on the algorithm's detection resolution and
delay. The end result is a lightweight online CPD algorithm, that is also
explainable by virtue of the well-appreciated interpretability of RDPG
embeddings. This is in stark contrast with most existing graph CPD approaches,
which either rely on extensive computation, or they store and process the
entire observed time series. An apparent limitation of the RDPG model is its
suitability for undirected and unweighted graphs only, a gap we aim to close
here to broaden the scope of the CPD framework. Unlike previous proposals, our
non-parametric RDPG model for weighted graphs does not require a priori
specification of the weights' distribution to perform inference and estimation.
This network modeling contribution is of independent interest beyond CPD. We
offer an open-source implementation of the novel online CPD algorithm for
weighted and direct graphs, whose effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated

  Transfer Functions with Resultant Demonstration of the Mechanism of Many-Body
  Localization",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental link between entanglement dynamics and non-equilibrium
statistics in isolated quantum systems has been established in theory and
confirmed via experiment. However, the understanding of several consequential
phenomena, such as the Many-Body Localization (MBL), has been obstructed by the
lack of a systematic approach to obtain many-body entanglement dynamics. This
paper introduces the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) approach to
entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems and employs this new
framework to demonstrate the mechanism of MBL in disordered spin chains. We
show that in the QCTF framework, the entanglement dynamics of two-level
constituent particles of a many-body quantum system can be fully characterized
directly from the system's Hamiltonian, which circumvents the bottleneck of
calculating the many-body system's time-evolution. By employing the QCTF-based
approach to entanglement dynamics, we demonstrate MBL dynamics in disordered
Heisenberg spin chains through the suppressed quasi-periodic spin's
entanglement evolution after a quench from an anti-ferromagnetic state.
Furthermore, we prove the validity of a previous fundamental conjecture
regarding the MBL phase by showing that in strongly-disordered spin chains with
short-range interactions, the quantum correlation between particles is
exponentially attenuated with respect to the site-to-site distance. Moreover,
we obtain the lowest possible amplitude of the quasi-periodic spin's
entanglement as a function of disorder in the chain. The QCTF analysis is
verified by exact numerical simulation of the system's evolution. We also show
that QCTF provides a new foundation to study the Eigenstate Thermalization
Hypothesis (ETH). The QCTF methodology can be extended in various ways to
address general issues regarding non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics in spin
lattices with different geometries.

critical exponent of unity. We propose a mean-field pseudospin model that
explains this behavior. Specifically, we model the atoms and their local

further superimpose an exchange interaction between dynamical heterogeneities,

a measure of point-to-set correlations, and that local frustrations in the

process redirects the scattered input signal inducing instantaneous changes in
both monitored signals, which in turn locates the hidden objects. Once the

First, it retrieves few-shot examples from a training bank using Target
Similarity Tuning (TST), a novel method for semantic example selection. TST
learns to recognize utterances that describe similar target programs despite
differences in surface natural language features. Then, Synchromesh feeds the
examples to a pre-trained language model and samples programs using Constrained
Semantic Decoding (CSD): a general framework for constraining the output to a
set of valid programs in the target language. CSD leverages constraints on
partial outputs to sample complete correct programs, and needs neither
re-training nor fine-tuning of the language model. We evaluate our methods by
synthesizing code from natural language descriptions using GPT-3 and Codex in
three real-world languages: SQL queries, Vega-Lite visualizations and SMCalFlow
programs. These domains showcase rich constraints that CSD is able to enforce,
including syntax, scope, typing rules, and contextual logic. We observe
substantial complementary gains from CSD and TST in prediction accuracy and in
effectively preventing run-time errors.

become increasingly relevant over the last two decades. In order to
successfully transfer information from one task to another, it is critical to
understand the similarities and differences between the domains. In this paper,
we introduce the notion of \emph{performance gap}, an intuitive and novel
measure of the distance between learning tasks. Unlike existing measures which
are used as tools to bound the difference of expected risks between tasks
(e.g., $\mathcal{H}$-divergence or discrepancy distance), we theoretically show
that the performance gap can be viewed as a data- and algorithm-dependent
regularizer, which controls the model complexity and leads to finer guarantees.
More importantly, it also provides new insights and motivates a novel principle
for designing strategies for knowledge sharing and transfer: gap minimization.
We instantiate this principle with two algorithms: 1. gapBoost, a novel and
principled boosting algorithm that explicitly minimizes the performance gap
between source and target domains for transfer learning; and 2. gapMTNN, a
representation learning algorithm that reformulates gap minimization as
semantic conditional matching for multitask learning. Our extensive evaluation
on both transfer learning and multitask learning benchmark data sets shows that

passes through all longest paths of a connected graph. Although this has been
verified for some special classes of graphs such as outerplanar graphs,
circular arc graphs, and series-parallel graphs, the answer is negative for
general graphs. In this paper, we prove among other results that if we replace
the vertex by a bond, then the answer is affirmative. A bond of a graph is a
minimal nonempty edge-cut. In particular, in any 2-connected graph, the set of
all edges incident to a vertex is a bond, called a vertex-bond. Clearly, for a
2-connected graph, a path passes through a vertex $v$ if and only if it meets
the vertex-bond with respect to $v$. Therefore, a very natural approach to
Gallai's question is to study whether there is a bond meeting all longest
paths. Let $p$ denote the length of a longest path of connected graphs. We show
that for any 2-connected graph, there is a bond meeting all paths of length at
least $p-1$. We then prove that for any 3-connected graph, there is a bond
meeting all paths of length at least $p-2$. For a $k$-connected graph

data-centric approach to the transfer learning problem and examine the
existence of generalizable knowledge between histopathological datasets. First,
we create a standardization workflow for aggregating existing histopathological
data. We then measure inter-domain knowledge by training ResNet18 models across
multiple histopathological datasets, and cross-transferring between them to
determine the quantity and quality of innate shared knowledge. Additionally, we
use weight distillation to share knowledge between models without additional
training. We find that hard to learn, multi-class datasets benefit most from
pretraining, and a two stage learning framework incorporating a large source
domain such as ImageNet allows for better utilization of smaller datasets.
Furthermore, we find that weight distillation enables models trained on purely
histopathological features to outperform models using external natural image

the conditions necessary for CO core formation in dwarf galaxies, we have used
the catalog of Rubio et al. (2022, in preparation) for CO cores in WLM, a Local
Group dwarf with an oxygen abundance that is 13% of solar. Here we aim to
characterize the galactic environments in which these 57 CO cores formed. We
grouped the cores together based on proximity to each other and strong FUV
emission, examining properties of the star forming region enveloping the cores
and the surrounding environment where the cores formed. We find that high HI
surface density does not necessarily correspond to higher total CO mass, but
regions with higher CO mass have higher HI surface densities. We also find the
cores in star forming regions spanning a wide range of ages show no correlation
between age and CO core mass, suggesting that the small size of the cores is
not due to fragmentation of the clouds with age. The presence of CO cores in a
variety of different local environments, along with the similar properties
between star forming regions with and without CO cores, leads us to conclude
that there are no obvious environmental characteristics that drive the

used to fit a data set equally well, especially if the data is sparse. In such
cases, these mathematically different but similar looking functional forms are
typically considered interchangeable. Recent work, however, shows that similar
functional responses may nonetheless result in significantly different
bifurcation points for the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey system. Since the
bifurcation behaviours include destabilising oscillations, predicting the
occurrence of such behaviours is clearly important. Ecologically, different
bifurcation behaviours mean that different predictions may be obtained from the
models. These predictions can range from stable coexistence to the extinction
of both species, so obtaining more accurate predictions is also clearly
important for conservationists. Mathematically, this difference in bifurcation
structure given similar functional responses is called structural sensitivity.
We extend the existing work to find that the Leslie-Gower-May predator-prey
system is also structurally sensitive to the functional response. Using the
Rosenzweig-MacArthur and Leslie-Gower-May models, we then aim to determine if
there is some way to obtain a functional description of data such that our
model is not structurally sensitive. We first add stochasticity to the
functional responses and find that better similarity of the resulting
bifurcation structures is achieved. Then, we analyze the functional responses
using two different methods to determine which part of each function
contributes most to the observed bifurcation behaviour. We find that prey
densities around the coexistence steady state are most important in defining
the functional response. Lastly, we propose a procedure for ecologists and

positive streamers in air and streamer deceleration in fields below the steady
propagation field. We generate constant-velocity positive streamers in air with
an axisymmetric fluid model, by initially adjusting the applied voltage based
on the streamer velocity. After an initial transient, we observe steady
propagation for velocities of $3\times10^4$ m/s to $1.2\times10^5$ m/s, during
which streamer properties and the background field do not change. This
propagation mode is not fully stable, in the sense that a small change in
streamer properties or background field eventually leads to acceleration or
deceleration. An important finding is that faster streamers are able to
propagate in significantly lower background fields than slower ones, indicating
that there is no unique stability field. We relate the streamer radius,
velocity, maximal electric field and background electric field to a
characteristic time scale for the loss of conductivity. This relation is
qualitatively confirmed by studying streamers in N2-O2 mixtures with less
oxygen than air. In such mixtures, steady streamers require lower background
fields, due to a reduction in the attachment and recombination rates. We also
study the deceleration of streamers, which is important to predict how far they
can propagate in a low field. Stagnating streamers are simulated by applying a
constant applied voltage. We show how the properties of these streamers relate
to the steady cases, and present a phenomenological model with fitted
coefficients that describes the evolution of the velocity and radius. Finally,
we compare the lengths of the stagnated streamers with predictions based on the
conventional stability field.

scholars have often assumed that models do not extrapolate, i.e., they learn
from their training samples and process new input by interpolation. This
assumption is questionable: we show that models extrapolate frequently; the
extent of extrapolation varies and can be socially consequential. We
demonstrate that extrapolation happens for a substantial portion of datasets
more than one would consider reasonable. How can we trust models if we do not
know whether they are extrapolating? Given a model trained to recommend
clinical procedures for patients, can we trust the recommendation when the
model considers a patient older or younger than all the samples in the training

recommendations about Black and Hispanic patients? Which dimension (race,
gender, or age) does extrapolation happen? Even if a model is trained on people
of all races, it still may extrapolate in significant ways related to race. The
leading question is, to what extent can we trust AI models when they process
inputs that fall outside their training set? This paper investigates several
social applications of AI, showing how models extrapolate without notice. We
also look at different sub-spaces of extrapolation for specific individuals

by a narrow bandwidth and low dynamic range. In this work, we develop a
dual-pump, broadband Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier that
combines a phase-sensitive extinction ratio of 56 dB with single-mode squeezing
on par with the best resonator-based squeezers. We also demonstrate two-mode
squeezing at microwave frequencies with bandwidth in the gigahertz range that
is almost two orders of magnitude wider than that of contemporary
resonator-based squeezers. Our amplifier is capable of simultaneously creating
entangled microwave photon pairs with large frequency separation, with
potential applications including high-fidelity qubit readout, quantum
illumination and teleportation.

exploit the interplay between magnetism and topological electronic states. Some
of the most exciting features of this family are the dramatic dependence of the
easy magnetization direction on the rare-earth specie, despite other magnetic
and electronic properties being essentially unchanged, and the Kagome geometry
of the Mn planes that in principle can generate flat bands and Dirac points;
gapping of the Dirac points by spin-orbit coupling has been suggested recently
to be responsible for the observed anomalous Hall response in the member
TbMn$_6$Sn$_6$. In this paper, we address both issues with density functional
calculations and are able to explain, with full quantitative agreement, the
evolution of magnetic anisotropy, including a complete reversal upon adding an
$f$-electron with zero magnetic orbital quantum number when going from Ho to
Er. We also show the microscopic origin of this computational result using a
simple and physically transparent analytical model. We analyze in detail the
topological properties of Mn-dominated bands and demonstrate how they emerge
from the multiorbital planar Kagome model. We further show that, despite this
fact, most of the topological features at the Brillouin zone corner K are
strongly 3D, and therefore cannot explain the observed quasi-2D AHE, while
those few that show a quasi-2D dispersion are too far removed from the Fermi
level. We conclude that, contrary to previous claims, Kagome-derived
topological band features bear little relevance to transport in
$R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$, albeit they may possibly be brought to focus by electron or
hole doping.

scale for large models. In vehicular networks, FL must be adapted to the
limited communication resources, the mobility of the edge nodes, and the

networks using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and network slicing. To
ensure heterogeneous service requirements for different vehicles, we propose a
network slicing architecture. We focus on a non-cellular network scenario where
vehicles communicate by the broadcast approach via the direct device-to-device
interface. In such a vehicular network, resource allocation among vehicles is
very difficult, mainly due to (i) the rapid variation of wireless channels
among highly mobile vehicles and (ii) the lack of a central coordination point.
Thus, the possibility of acquiring instantaneous channel state information to
perform centralized resource allocation is precluded. The resource allocation
problem considered is therefore very complex. It includes not only the usual
spectrum and power allocation, but also coverage selection (which target
vehicles to broadcast to) and packet selection (which network slice to use).
This problem must be solved jointly since selected packets can be overlaid
using NOMA and therefore spectrum and power must be carefully allocated for
better vehicle coverage. To do so, we provide a optimization approach and study
the NP-hardness of the problem. Then, we model the problem using multi-agent
Markov decision process. Finally, we use a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
approach to solve the problem. The proposed DRL algorithm is practical because
it can be implemented in an online and distributed manner. We show that our
approach is robust and efficient when faced with different variations of the
network parameters and compared to centralized benchmarks.

detailed representation of a forest structure and an accurate inversion of

registration methods, and some marker-free automated registration methods have
low efficiency due to the process of object (e.g., tree, crown) segmentation.
Therefore, we use a divide-and-conquer strategy and propose an automated and
efficient method to register ULS and ground LiDAR point clouds in forests.
Registration involves coarse alignment and fine registration, where the coarse
alignment of point clouds is divided into vertical and horizontal alignment.
The vertical alignment is achieved by ground alignment, which is achieved by
the transformation relationship between normal vectors of the ground point
cloud and the horizontal plane, and the horizontal alignment is achieved by
canopy projection image matching. During image matching, vegetation points are
first distinguished by the ground filtering algorithm, and then, vegetation
points are projected onto the horizontal plane to obtain two binary images. To
match the two images, a matching strategy is used based on canopy shape context
features, which are described by a two-point congruent set and canopy overlap.
Finally, we implement coarse alignment of ULS and ground LiDAR datasets by
combining the results of ground alignment and image matching and finish fine
registration. Also, the effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by field measurements of forest plots. Experimental
results show that the ULS and ground LiDAR data in different plots are
registered, of which the horizontal alignment errors are less than 0.02 m, and
the average runtime of the proposed method is less than 1 second.

behind fuzzing is to check the behavior of software against a large number of
randomly generated inputs, trying to cover all interesting parts of the input
space, while observing the tested software for anomalous behaviour. One of the
biggest challenges facing fuzzer users is how to validate software behavior,
and how to improve the quality of oracles used. While mutation analysis is the
premier technique for evaluating the quality of software test oracles, mutation
score is rarely used as a metric for evaluating fuzzer quality. Unless mutation
analysis researchers can solve multiple problems that make applying mutation
analysis to fuzzing challenging, mutation analysis may be permanently sidelined
in one of the most important areas of testing and security research. This paper
attempts to understand the main challenges in applying mutation analysis for
evaluating fuzzers, so that researchers can focus on solving these challenges.

difference between probability densities, which benefits optimization objective
function with better convexity and is insensitive to data noise. Nevertheless,
it is always an important question to make the seismic signals suitable for
comparison using the quadratic Wasserstein metric. The squaring scaling is
worth exploring since it guarantees the convexity caused by data shift.
However, as mentioned in [Commun. Inf. Syst., 2019, 19:95-145], the squaring
scaling may lose uniqueness and result in more local minima to the misfit
function. In our previous work [J. Comput. Phys., 2018, 373:188-209], the
quadratic Wasserstein metric with squaring scaling was successfully applied to
the earthquake location problem. But it only discussed the inverse problem with
few degrees of freedom. In this work, we will present a more in-depth study on
the combination of squaring scaling technique and the quadratic Wasserstein
metric. By discarding some inapplicable data, picking seismic phases, and
developing a new normalization method, we successfully invert the seismic
velocity structure based on the squaring scaling technique and the quadratic

similarity information in samples as possible to improve the common
short-coming of non-parallel plane classifiers. Compared with twin support
vector machines (TWSVM), it reduces the time complexity by deleting the
superfluous constraints using the inter-class K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).
Multi-view learning (MVL) is a newly developing direction of machine learning,
which focuses on learning acquiring information from the data indicated by
multiple feature sets. In this paper, we propose multi-view learning with
privileged weighted twin support vector machines (MPWTSVM). It not only
inherits the advantages of WLTSVM but also has its characteristics. Firstly, it
enhances generalization ability by mining intra-class information from the same
perspective. Secondly, it reduces the redundancy constraints with the help of
inter-class information, thus improving the running speed. Most importantly, it
can follow both the consensus and the complementarity principle simultaneously
as a multi-view classification model. The consensus principle is realized by
minimizing the coupling items of the two views in the original objective
function. The complementary principle is achieved by establishing privileged
information paradigms and MVL. A standard quadratic programming solver is used
to solve the problem. Compared with multi-view classification models such as
SVM-2K, MVTSVM, MCPK, and PSVM-2V, our model has better accuracy and

natural language query. Different from typical information retrieval tasks,
code search requires to bridge the semantic gap between the programming

research topic. Typical methods for neural code search first represent the code
snippet and query text as separate embeddings, and then use vector distance
(e.g. dot-product or cosine) to calculate the semantic similarity between them.
There exist many different ways for aggregating the variable length of code or
query tokens into a learnable embedding, including bi-encoder, cross-encoder,
and poly-encoder. The goal of the query encoder and code encoder is to produce
embeddings that are close with each other for a related pair of query and the

active region. Particularly, it underwent the partial eruption in three steps,
i.e. the precursor, the first eruption, and the second eruption, while the
later two were associated with a C1.0 flare and a C3.9 flare, respectively.
During the precursor, slow magnetic reconnection took place between the
filament and the adjoining loops that also rooted in the sunspot. The
continuous reconnection not only caused the filament to split into three groups
of threads vertically but also formed a new filament, which was growing and
accompanied brightening took place around the site. Subsequently, the growing
filament erupted together with one group splitted threads, resulted in the
first eruption. At the beginning of the first eruption, a subsequent magnetic
reconnection occurred between the erupting splitted threads and another ambient
magnetic loop. After about three minutes, the second eruption occurred as a
result of the eruption of two larger unstable filaments induced by the magnetic
reconnection. The high-resolution observation provides a direct evidence that
magnetic reconnection between filament and its ambient magnetic fields could
induce the vertical splitting of the filament, resulting in partial eruption.

sensors has reduced its spatial resolution that causes detail loss. One
solution is to fuse the low spatial resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and
the panchromatic image (PAN) with inverse features to get the high-resolution
hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Most of the existing fusion methods just focus on
small fusion ratios like 4 or 6, which might be impractical for some large
ratios' HSI and PAN image pairs. Moreover, the ill-posedness of restoring
detail information in HSI with hundreds of bands from PAN image with only one
band has not been solved effectively, especially under large fusion ratios.
Therefore, a lightweight unmixing-based pan-guided fusion network (Pgnet) is
proposed to mitigate this ill-posedness and improve the fusion performance
significantly. Note that the fusion process of the proposed network is under
the projected low-dimensional abundance subspace with an extremely large fusion
ratio of 16. Furthermore, based on the linear and nonlinear relationships

Our method transforms the student into its own teacher, and if the self-teacher
makes wrong predictions while distilling information, the error is rectified
prior to the knowledge being distilled. Specifically, the teacher targets are
dynamically tweaked by the agency of ground-truth while distilling the
knowledge gained from traditional training. Our proposed DR-KD performs
remarkably well in the absence of a sophisticated cumbersome teacher model and
achieves comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art teacher-free

account constraints on the reheating temperature, which is needed to avoid the
overproduction of gravitinos. It turns out that the desired phase transition
from a supersymmetric vacuum to a metastable vacuum is allowed only in the
light gravitino mass region $m_{3/2} < 4.7$ eV. This is achieved by either
rolling down potential or tunneling processes depending on the reheating
temperature. We show that when the tunneling processes are realized, abundant
gravitational waves could be produced from collisions of runaway bubbles. The
resulting gravitational waves are detectable with the future gravitational wave
interferometers like LISA and DECIGO.

variables and its rivals' decision variables, local information needs to be
exchanged through a center/network in most existing work for seeking the Nash

does not require communications among players. The proposed algorithm uses
simultaneous perturbation method to estimate the gradient of each cost
function, and uses mirror descent method to search for the Nash equilibrium. We
provide asymptotic analysis for the bias and variance of gradient estimates,
and show the proposed algorithm converges to the Nash equilibrium in mean
square for the class of strictly monotone games at a rate faster than the
existing algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed method is buttressed in

periodic orbits of low-dimensional deterministic dynamics serve as a WKB
`skeleton' for chaotic quantum mechanics, we construct the corresponding
deterministic skeleton for infinite-dimensional lattice-discretized scalar
field theories. In the field-theoretical formulation, there is no evolution in
time, and there is no `Lyapunov horizon'; there is only an enumeration of
lattice states that contribute to the theory's partition sum, each a global
spatiotemporal solution of system's deterministic Euler-Lagrange equations.
  The reformulation aligns `chaos theory' with the standard solid state, field
theory, and statistical mechanics. In a spatiotemporal, crystallographer
formulation, the time-periodic orbits of dynamical systems theory are replaced
by periodic $d$-dimensional Bravais cell tilings of spacetime, each weighted by
the inverse of its instability, its Hill determinant. Hyperbolic shadowing of
large cells by smaller ones ensures that the predictions of the theory are
dominated by the smallest Bravais cells.
  The form of the partition function of a given field theory is determined by
the group of its spatiotemporal symmetries, that is, by the space group of its
lattice discretization, best studied on its reciprocal lattice. Already
1-dimensional lattice discretization is of sufficient interest to be the focus
of this paper. In particular, from a spatiotemporal field theory perspective,
`time'-reversal is a purely crystallographic notion, a reflection point group,
leading to a novel, symmetry quotienting perspective of time-reversible
theories and associated topological zeta functions.

the methods we develop work for higher-order clique expansions as well. To the

create large-scale arrays of donors, featuring few hundred nanometre
inter-donor spacing. Here, we explore the feasibility of this approach by
implanting low-energy ions into silicon devices featuring an enlarged 60x60
$\mu$m sensitive area and an ultra-thin 3.2 nm gate oxide - capable of hosting
large-scale donor arrays. By combining a focused ion beam system incorporating
an electron-beam-ion-source with in-vacuum ultra-low noise ion detection
electronics, we first demonstrate a versatile method to spatially map the
device response characteristics to shallowly implanted 12 keV $^1$H$_2^+$ ions.
Despite the weak internal electric field, near-unity charge collection
efficiency is obtained from the entire sensitive area. This can be explained by
the critical role that the high-quality thermal gate oxide plays in the ion
detection response, allowing an initial rapid diffusion of ion induced charge
away from the implant site. Next, we adapt our approach to perform
deterministic implantation of a few thousand 24 keV $^{40}$Ar$^{2+}$ ions into

reduced ionisation from the heavier ion species, a fluence-independent

  Linear Valuation with Unknown Noise","20 pages, 1 figure (including 2 subfigures)",,,,"cs.LG econ.EM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In feature-based dynamic pricing, a seller sets appropriate prices for a
sequence of products (described by feature vectors) on the fly by learning from
the binary outcomes of previous sales sessions (""Sold"" if valuation $\geq$
price, and ""Not Sold"" otherwise). Existing works either assume noiseless linear
valuation or precisely-known noise distribution, which limits the applicability
of those algorithms in practice when these assumptions are hard to verify. In
this work, we study two more agnostic models: (a) a ""linear policy"" problem
where we aim at competing with the best linear pricing policy while making no
assumptions on the data, and (b) a ""linear noisy valuation"" problem where the
random valuation is linear plus an unknown and assumption-free noise. For the
former model, we show a $\tilde{\Theta}(d^{\frac13}T^{\frac23})$ minimax regret
up to logarithmic factors. For the latter model, we present an algorithm that
achieves an $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac34})$ regret, and improve the best-known lower
bound from $\Omega(T^{\frac35})$ to $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{\frac23})$. These
results demonstrate that no-regret learning is possible for feature-based
dynamic pricing under weak assumptions, but also reveal a disappointing fact
that the seemingly richer pricing feedback is not significantly more useful
than the bandit-feedback in regret reduction.

increasingly complicated task due to the involvement of multiple agencies and
the city's expansion across cyber and social layers. In this paper, we propose
an extensive form perfect information game to model interactions and optimal
city resource allocations when a Terrorist Organization (TO) performs attacks
on multiple targets across two conceptual SC levels, a physical, and a
cyber-social. The Smart City Defense Game (SCDG) considers three players that
initially are entitled to a specific finite budget. Two SC agencies that have
to defend their physical or social territories respectively, fight against a
common enemy, the TO. Each layer consists of multiple targets and the attack
outcome depends on whether the resources allocated there by the associated
agency, exceed or not the TO's. Each player's utility is equal to the number of
successfully defended targets. The two agencies are allowed to make budget
transfers provided that it is beneficial for both. We completely characterize
the Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) of the SCDG that consists of
strategies for optimal resource exchanges between SC agencies and accounts for
the TO's budget allocation across the physical and social targets. Also, we
present numerical and comparative results demonstrating that when the SC
players act according to the SPNE, they maximize the number of successfully
defended targets. The SCDG is shown to be a promising solution for modeling
critical resource allocations between SC parties in the face of multi-layer
simultaneous terrorist attacks.

communicate with each other, over time, in order to minimize/maximize a global

Age-of-Information (AoI), which measures the freshness of data received, may be
large and hence hinder algorithmic convergence. In this paper, we study the
convergence of general distributed gradient-based optimization algorithms in
the presence of communication that neither happens periodically nor at
stochastically independent points in time. We show that convergence is
guaranteed provided the random variables associated with the AoI processes are
stochastically dominated by a random variable with finite first moment. This
improves on previous requirements of boundedness of more than the first moment.
We then introduce stochastically strongly connected (SSC) networks, a new
stochastic form of strong connectedness for time-varying networks. We show: If
for any $p \ge0$ the processes that describe the success of communication
between agents in a SSC network are $\alpha$-mixing with $n^{p-1}\alpha(n)$
summable, then the associated AoI processes are stochastically dominated by a
random variable with finite $p$-th moment. In combination with our first
contribution, this implies that distributed stochastic gradient descend
converges in the presence of AoI, if $\alpha(n)$ is summable.

achieved state-of-the-art performance on graphs, but its success could
typically hinge on careful training with amounts of expensive and
time-consuming labeled data. To alleviate labeled data scarcity, self-training
methods have been widely adopted on graphs by labeling high-confidence
unlabeled nodes and then adding them to the training step. In this line, we
empirically make a thorough study for current self-training methods on graphs.
Surprisingly, we find that high-confidence unlabeled nodes are not always
useful, and even introduce the distribution shift issue between the original
labeled dataset and the augmented dataset by self-training, severely hindering
the capability of self-training on graphs. To this end, in this paper, we
propose a novel Distribution Recovered Graph Self-Training framework (DR-GST),
which could recover the distribution of the original labeled dataset.
Specifically, we first prove the equality of loss function in self-training
framework under the distribution shift case and the population distribution if
each pseudo-labeled node is weighted by a proper coefficient. Considering the
intractability of the coefficient, we then propose to replace the coefficient
with the information gain after observing the same changing trend between them,
where information gain is respectively estimated via both dropout variational
inference and dropedge variational inference in DR-GST. However, such a
weighted loss function will enlarge the impact of incorrect pseudo labels. As a
result, we apply the loss correction method to improve the quality of pseudo
labels. Both our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on five
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DR-GST, as
well as each well-designed component in DR-GST.

magnetic insulators has opened exciting perspectives for transporting spin

the nonlocal thermal gradients on the magnon transport remain unclear. Here, by
performing nonlocal harmonic voltage measurements, we investigate magnon
transport in perpendicularly magnetized ultrathin Tm3Fe5O12 (TmIG) films
coupled to Pt electrodes. We show that the first harmonic nonlocal voltage
captures spin-driven magnon transport in TmIG, as expected, and the second
harmonic is dominated by thermoelectric voltages driven by current-induced
thermal gradients at the detector. The magnon diffusion length in TmIG is found
to be on the order of 0.3 {\mu}m at 0.5 T and gradually decays to 0.2 {\mu}m at
0.8 T, which we attribute to the suppression of the magnon relaxation time due
to the increase of the Gilbert damping with field. By performing current,
magnetic field, and distance dependent nonlocal and local measurements we
demonstrate that the second harmonic nonlocal voltage exhibits five
thermoelectric contributions, which originate from the nonlocal spin Seebeck
effect and the ordinary, planar, spin, and anomalous Nernst effects. Our work
provides a guide on how to disentangle magnon signals from diverse
thermoelectric voltages of spin and magnetic origin in nonlocal magnon devices,

model and general relativity. Testing Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) via
atomic systems attracts extensive interests in theory and experiment. Some
recent proposals for testing LSV present that the effects of violation can be
described as a local interaction. Further, the test precision of LSV can be
enhanced via quantum entanglement and its quantum Fisher information (QFI)
implicates that the test precision can asymptotically reach the Heisenberg
limit. In general, the limited resolution of collective observables prevents
the detection of large QFI. Here, we propose a multimode many-body quantum
interferometry for testing the LSV parameter $\kappa$ via an ensemble of spinor
atoms. By employing an $N$-atom multimode GHZ state, the test precision can
attain the Heisenberg limit $\Delta \kappa \propto 1/(F^2N)$ with the spin
length $F$ and the atomic number $N$. We find an actual observable (or
practical measurement process) to achieve the ultimate precision and study the
LSV test via an experimentally accessible three-mode interferometry with Bose
condensed spin-1 atoms for example. By selecting suitable input states and
unitary recombination operation, the LSV parameter $\kappa$ can be extracted
via population measurement. Especially, the measurement precision of the LSV
parameter $\kappa$ can beat the standard quantum limit and even approach the
Heisenberg limit via spin mixing dynamics or driving through quantum phase
transitions.
  Our proposed scheme may open up a feasible way for a drastic improvement of
the LSV tests with atomic systems and provide an alternative application of
multi-particle entangled states.

spaces, which is better suited for Relativistic Quantum Information Theory than
the ordinary Hilbert space description, has been suggested. However, the
mathematical framework presented in that work does not apply to massless
particles. It is because, unlike massive particles, massless particles cannot
assume the zero momentum state and hence the mass shell associated with
massless particles has non-trivial cohomology. More precisely, the helicities
of massless particles, which are shown to be equal to the first Chern classes
of the bundles associated with the particles, act as topological obstructions
that prevent us from applying the same framework. To overcome this difficulty,
this paper suggests a new framework that applies to massless particles.
Applications to the cases of massless particles with spin-1 and 2, namely the
photon and the graviton, will reveal that the field equations, the gauge
conditions, and the gauge freedoms of Electromagnetism and General Relativity
naturally arise as manifestations of an inertial observer's perception of
internal quantum states of a photon and a graviton, respectively. Finally, we
show that gauge freedom is exhibited by all massless particles, except those
with spin-0 and 1/2.

has been repeatedly highlighted. Multiple side-channel attacks, which seek to
exploit shared components for leaking information, have been devised, mostly
targeting shared caching components. In response, the research community has
proposed multiple cache designs that aim at curbing the source of side
channels. With multiple competing designs, there is a need for assessing the
level of security against side-channel attacks that each design offers.
  In this work we propose CacheFX, a flexible framework for assessing and
evaluating the resilience of cache designs to side-channel attacks. CacheFX
allows the evaluator to implement various cache designs, victims, and
attackers, as well as to exercise them for assessing the leakage of information
via the cache.
  To demonstrate the power of CacheFX, we implement multiple cache designs and
replacement algorithms, and devise three evaluation metrics that measure
different aspects of the caches:(1) the entropy induced by a memory access; (2)
the complexity of building an eviction set; and (3) protection against
cryptographic attacks. Our experiments highlight that different security
metrics give different insights to designs, making a comprehensive analysis
mandatory. For instance, while eviction-set building was fastest for randomized
skewed caches, these caches featured lower eviction entropy and higher
practical attack complexity. Our experiments show that all non-partitioned
designs allow for effective cryptographic attacks. However, in state-of-the-art
secure caches, eviction-based attacks are more difficult to mount than
occupancy-based attacks, highlighting the need to consider the latter in cache
design.

shape registration. The partial alignment task is extremely complex, as it
jointly tries to match between points and identify which points do not appear
in the corresponding shape, causing the solution to be non-unique and ill-posed
in most cases.
  Until now, two principal methodologies have been suggested to solve this
problem: sample a subset of points that are likely to have correspondences or
perform soft alignment between the point clouds and try to avoid a match to an
occluded part. These heuristics work when the partiality is mild or when the
transformation is small but fails for severe occlusions or when outliers are
present. We present a unique approach named Confidence Guided Distance Network
(CGD-net), where we fuse learnable similarity between point embeddings and
spatial distance between point clouds, inducing an optimized solution for the
overlapping points while ignoring parts that only appear in one of the shapes.
The point feature generation is done by a self-supervised architecture that
repels far points to have different embeddings, therefore succeeds to align
partial views of shapes, even with excessive internal symmetries or acute
rotations. We compare our network to recently presented learning-based and
axiomatic methods and report a fundamental boost in performance.

since a common global model in FL may not adapt to the heterogeneous data
distribution of each user. To counter this issue, personalized FL (PFL) was
proposed to produce dedicated local models for each individual user. However,
PFL is far from its maturity, because existing PFL solutions either demonstrate
unsatisfactory generalization towards different model architectures or cost
enormous extra computation and memory. In this work, we propose federated
learning with personalized sparse mask (FedSpa), a novel PFL scheme that
employs personalized sparse masks to customize sparse local models on the edge.
Instead of training an intact (or dense) PFL model, FedSpa only maintains a
fixed number of active parameters throughout training (aka sparse-to-sparse
training), which enables users' models to achieve personalization with cheap
communication, computation, and memory cost. We theoretically show that the
iterates obtained by FedSpa converge to the local minimizer of the formulated
SPFL problem at rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that FedSpa significantly saves communication and
computation costs, while simultaneously achieves higher model accuracy and
faster convergence speed against several state-of-the-art PFL methods.

introduce two approaches that have complementary features. The first approach
employs a linear-combination-of-unitaries circuit, which enables one to
probabilistically prepare the Gutzwiller wave function on a quantum computer,
while the second approach uses importance sampling to estimate observables
stochastically, similar to a quantum Monte Carlo method in classical
computation. The proposed scheme is demonstrated with numerical simulations for
the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we perform quantum
simulations using a real quantum device, demonstrating that the proposed scheme
can reproduce the exact ground-state energy of the two-site Fermi-Hubbard model
within error bars.

communication (MC) has been derived for spatial dimensions 2 and 3 in recent
works, however, the Shannon capacity of FAP channels has yet to be determined.
The fundamental obstacle to determining the capacity of FAP channels is rooted
in the multi-dimensional Cauchy distribution nature of the FAP density,
particularly when the drift velocity approaches zero. Consequently,
conventional approaches for maximizing mutual information are inapplicable as
the first and second moments of Cauchy distributions are non-existent.
  This paper presents a comprehensive characterization of the zero-drift FAP
channel capacity for 2D and 3D spaces. The capacity formula for the FAP channel
is found to have a form similar to the Gaussian channel case (under
second-moment power constraint). Notably, the capacity of the 3D FAP channel is
twice that of the 2D FAP channel, providing evidence that FAP channels have
greater capacity as spatial dimensions increase.
  Our technical contributions include the application of a modified logarithmic
constraint in lieu of the typical power constraint, and the selection of an
output signal constraint as a replacement for the input signal constraint,
resulting in a more concise formula.

then refines the attained initialization based upon a sequence of gradient

escape of cosmic-ray protons from potential SNR accelerators. These cosmic rays
interact with the ISM to produce TeV gamma-rays. We utilise the isotropic

energy-dependent escape and propagation of protons into the ISM. This work is
the first attempt at modelling the spatial morphology of gamma-rays towards
HESS J1804-216, using arc-minute ISM observations from both Mopra and the
Southern Galactic Plane Survey. The spectral and spatial distributions of
gamma-rays for the two nearby potential SNR counterparts, SNR G8.7-0.1 and the

  Attention for 3D Point Cloud Classification","15 pages, 10figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning a powerful representation from point clouds is a fundamental and
challenging problem in the field of computer vision. Different from images
where RGB pixels are stored in the regular grid, for point clouds, the
underlying semantic and structural information of point clouds is the spatial
layout of the points. Moreover, the properties of challenging in-context and
background noise pose more challenges to point cloud analysis. One assumption
is that the poor performance of the classification model can be attributed to
the indistinguishable embedding feature that impedes the search for the optimal
classifier. This work offers a new strategy for learning powerful
representations via a contrastive learning approach that can be embedded into
any point cloud classification network. First, we propose a supervised
contrastive classification method to implement embedding feature distribution
refinement by improving the intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability. Second, to solve the confusion problem caused by small
inter-class compactness and inter-class separability. Second, to solve the
confusion problem caused by small inter-class variations between some
similar-looking categories, we propose a confusion-prone class mining strategy
to alleviate the confusion effect. Finally, considering that outliers of the
sample clusters in the embedding space may cause performance degradation, we
design an entropy-aware attention module with information entropy theory to
identify the outlier cases and the unstable samples by measuring the
uncertainty of predicted probability. The results of extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by
achieving 82.9% accuracy on the real-world ScanObjectNN dataset and substantial

considered constant over a certain timespan, and they permit to describe the
long-term evolution with a few parameters. Near-Earth objects (NEOs) generally
have a large eccentricity and therefore they can cross the orbits of the
planets. Moreover, some of them are known to be currently in a mean-motion
resonance with a planet. Thus, the methods previously used for the computation
of main-belt asteroid proper elements are not appropriate for such objects. In
this paper, we introduce a technique for the computation of proper elements of
planet-crossing asteroids that are in a mean-motion resonance with a planet.
First, we numerically average the Hamiltonian over the fast angles while
keeping all the resonant terms, and we describe how to continue a solution
beyond orbit crossing singularities. Proper elements are then extracted from a
frequency analysis of the averaged orbit-crossing solutions. We give proper
elements of some known resonant NEOs, and provide comparisons with non-resonant
models. These examples show that it is necessary to take into account the
effect of the resonance for the computation of accurate proper elements.

means that, for calculation of risk contributions of finely divided subgroups,
the advantage of the quantum method is reduced compared with risk measure

measurements show a negative THC for magnetic fields below 10 T and a sign
change to positive THC above. Theoretically, the sign and the order of
magnitude of the THC cannot be solely explained with magnetic excitations. We
demonstrate that, by incorporating spin-lattice coupling into our theoretical
calculations, the Berry curvature of magnon polarons counteracts the purely
magnonic contribution, reverses the overall sign of the THC, and increases its
magnitude, which significantly improves agreement with experimental data. Our
work highlights the crucial role of spin-lattice coupling in the thermal Hall

emission is expected to have steeper spectra compared to the cones. We present
a detailed analysis of the relative differences in spectra between the core and
conal emission from a large sample of 53 pulsars over a wide frequency range
between 100 MHz and 10 GHz. The core was seen to be much steeper than the cones
particularly between 100 MHz and 1 GHz with a relative difference between the

the spectra of the outer conal components to be steeper than the inner cone

+0.5. The flattening of the spectra from the magnetic axis towards the edge of
the open field line region with increasing curvature of the field lines is a
natural outcome of the coherent curvature radiation from charged soliton

In addition due to the relativistic beaming effect, the radiation is only
visible when it is directed towards the observer over a narrow angle

plasma clouds. This restricts the emission particularly from outer cones, that
are associated with field lines with larger curvature thereby making the

two consecutive frames in a video. It has a wide range of applications
including slow-motion video generation, frame-rate up-scaling and developing
video codecs. Some older works tackled this problem by assuming per-pixel
linear motion between video frames. However, objects often follow a non-linear
motion pattern in the real domain and some recent methods attempt to model
per-pixel motion by non-linear models (e.g., quadratic). A quadratic model can
also be inaccurate, especially in the case of motion discontinuities over time

invalid or inaccurate.
  In our paper, we propose to approximate the per-pixel motion using a
space-time convolution network that is able to adaptively select the motion
model to be used. Specifically, we are able to softly switch between a linear
and a quadratic model. Towards this end, we use an end-to-end 3D CNN
encoder-decoder architecture over bidirectional optical flows and occlusion
maps to estimate the non-linear motion model of each pixel. Further, a motion
refinement module is employed to refine the non-linear motion and the
interpolated frames are estimated by a simple warping of the neighboring frames
with the estimated per-pixel motion. Through a set of comprehensive
experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our model and show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on four datasets (Vimeo, DAVIS,

methodologies for defining a generally covariant formulation of nonperturbative
interacting quantum field theories (QFTs) without a fixed prearranged causal
background. Recent literature suggests that if the spacetime metric is not
fixed, e.g. because it is to be quantized along with the other fields, one may
not be able to avoid considering the Feynman integral in the original Lorentz
signature, without Wick rotation. Several mathematical phenomena are known,
however, which are at some point showstoppers to a mathematically sound
definition of Feynman integral in Lorentz signature. The Feynman integral
formulation, however, is known to have a differential reformulation, called to
be the master Dyson--Schwinger (MDS) equation for the field correlators. In
this paper it is shown that a particular presentation of the MDS equation can
be cast into a mathematically rigorously defined form: the involved function
spaces and operators can be strictly defined and their properties can be
established. Therefore, MDS equation can serve as a substitute for the Feynman
integral, in a mathematically sound formulation of constructive QFT, in
arbitrary signature, without a fixed background causal structure. It is also
shown that even in such a generally covariant setting, there is a canonical way
to define the Wilsonian regularization of the MDS equation. The main result of
the paper is a necessary and sufficient condition for the regularized MDS
solution space to be nonempty, for conformally invariant Lagrangians. This
theorem also provides an iterative approximation algorithm for obtaining
regularized MDS solutions, and is guaranteed to be convergent whenever the
solution space is nonempty. The algorithm could eventually serve as a method
for putting Lorentz signature QFTs onto lattice, in the original metric
signature.

to the ability to scale performance with increasing degree of specialization
with dataflow architectures or custom data types. To reduce the barrier for
software engineers and data scientists to adopt FPGAs, C++- and OpenCL-based
design entries with high-level synthesis (HLS) have been introduced. They
provide higher abstraction compared to register-transfer level (RTL)-based
design. HLS offers faster development time, better maintainability and more
flexibility in code exploration, when evaluating options for multi-dimension
tensors, convolutional layers or parallelism. Thus, HLS has been adopted by DNN
accelerator generation frameworks such as FINN and hls4ml.
  In this paper, we present an alternative backend RTL library for FINN. We
investigate and evaluate, across a spectrum of design dimensions, an RTL-based
implementation versus the original HLS variant. We show that for smaller design
parameters, RTL produces significantly smaller circuits. For larger circuits,
however, the look-up table (LUT) count of RTL-based design is slightly higher,
up to around $15\%$. On the other hand, HLS consistently requires more
flip-flops (FFs) (orders-of-magnitude increase) and block RAMs (BRAMs)
($2\times$ more). This also impacts the critical path delay, with RTL producing
significantly faster circuits, up to $80\%$. Furthermore, RTL also benefits
from at-least a $10\times$ reduction in synthesis time. Finally the results
were practically validated using a real-world use case of a multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) network used in network intrusion detection. Overall, since
HLS frameworks code-generate the hardware design, the benefits of the ease in
the design entry is less important as compared to synthesis time reduction
togther with resource benefits, this might make the RTL abstraction an
attractive alternative.

the generation of cosmic-ray electrons at collisionless shocks is presented. We
consider a recently proposed particle acceleration mechanism called stochastic
shock drift acceleration (SSDA). We find that SSDA may be understood as a
diffusive particle acceleration mechanism at an oblique shock of finite
thickness. More specifically, it is described by a solution to the
diffusion-convection equation for particles with the characteristic diffusion
length comparable to the shock thickness. On the other hand, the same equation
yields the standard DSA if the diffusion length is much longer than the
thickness. Although SSDA predicts, in general, a spectral index steeper than
DSA, it is much more efficient for low-energy electron acceleration and is
favorable for injection. The injection threshold energy corresponds to the
transition energy between the two different regimes. It is of the order of
$0.1\text{-}1$ MeV in typical interstellar and interplanetary conditions if the
dissipation scale of turbulence around the shock is determined by the ion
inertial length. The electron injection is more efficient at high $M_\textrm{A}
/ \cos \theta_{Bn}$ where $M_\textrm{A}$ and $\theta_{Bn}$ are the Alfv\'en
Mach number and the shock obliquity. The theory suggests that efficient
acceleration of electrons to ultra-relativistic energies will be more easily
realized at high-Mach-number young supernova remnant shocks, but not at weak or
moderate shocks in the heliosphere unless the upstream magnetic field is nearly

moves around in a spatially varying chemo-attractant environment. We consider
attractant concentration with strong and weak spatial gradient. During the
uphill and downhill motion of the cell along the gradient, we measure the
temporal variation of average methylation level of the receptor clusters. Our
numerical simulations show that the methylation dynamics depends sensitively on
the size of the receptor clusters and also on the strength of the gradient. At
short times after the beginning of a run, the methylation dynamics is mainly
controlled by short runs which are generally associated with high receptor
activity. This results in demethylation at short times. But for intermediate or
large times, long runs play an important role and depending on receptor
cooperativity or gradient strength, the qualitative variation of methylation
can be completely different in this time regime. For weak gradient, both for
uphill and downhill runs, after the initial demethylation, we find methylation
level increases steadily with time for all cluster sizes. Similar qualitative
behavior is observed for strong gradient during uphill runs as well. However,
the methylation dynamics for downhill runs in strong gradient show highly
non-trivial dependence on the receptor cluster size. We explain this behavior
as a result of interplay between the sensing and adaptation modules of the
signaling network.

periodic variability due to surface spots that in most cases can be modeled by
low-order harmonic expansion. However, high-precision satellite photometry
reveals tiny complex features in the light curves of some of these stars that
are difficult to explain as caused by a surface phenomenon under reasonable
assumptions. These features might originate from light extinction in corotating
magnetospheric clouds supported by a complex magnetic field dominated by
higher-order multipoles. We aim to understand the photometric signatures of
corotating magnetospheres that are governed by higher-order multipoles. We
determined the location of magnetospheric clouds from the minima of the
effective potential along the magnetic field lines for different orders of
multipoles and their combination. From the derived magnetospheric density
distribution, we calculated light curves accounting for absorption and
subsequent emission of light. For axisymmetric multipoles, the rigidly rotating
magnetosphere model is able to explain the observed tiny features in the light
curves only when the higher-order multipoles dominate the magnetic field not
only at the stellar surface, but even at the Kepler radius. However, even a
relatively weak nonaxisymmetric component leads to warping of equilibrium
surfaces. This introduces structures that can explain the tiny features
observed in the light curves of chemically peculiar stars. The light emission
contributes to the light variability only if a significant fraction of light is
absorbed in the magnetosphere.

unweighted averaging up to more complex learning-based functions like support
vector machines. Our results revealed that Stacking achieved the largest
performance gain of up to 13% F1-score increase. Augmenting showed consistent
improvement capabilities by up to 4% and is also applicable to single model

We show that full symmetry groups of these systems, which contain elements with

be replaced by magnetic groups consisting of elements with rotations acting
only on position vectors. This reduction follows from modified transformation
properties of electron spin, which in the considered systems becomes
effectively a pseudoscalar quantity remaining unchanged upon spatial operations
but changing its sign due to an operation of antisymmetry. We introduce a
unitary representation of the relevant magnetic point groups and use it for a
classification of collinear magnets from the viewpoint of
antiferromagnetism-induced spin splitting of electron bands near the center of
Brillouin zone. We prove that the recently revealed different altermagnetic
classes correspond in a unique way to all nontrivial magnetic Laue classes,
i.e., to the Laue groups containing the operation of antisymmetry only in
combination with a spatial rotation. Four of these Laue classes are found
compatible with a nonzero spin conductivity. Subsequent inspection of a simple

incorrect Shapiro steps, occurring at mixing frequencies between the external

It is attributed to nonlocality of planar junction electrodynamics, caused by

  The paper addresses the challenge of quantifying the FC individually for each

terms of the rank-size distribution coincides with the expected values of order
statistics in an independent Paretian sample. We study the bias and the mean
squared error of three well-behaving estimators of the underlying model
parameters. An empirical analysis of a large repository of academic papers
yields a good fit not only in the tail of the distribution (as it is usually
the case in the power law-like framework), but also across the whole domain.
Interestingly, the estimated models indicate higher degree of preferentially
attached citations and smaller share of randomness than previous studies.

dS group physically relevant for the description of dS spacetime and classical
phase spaces of elementary systems living on it. We review the construction of
(projective) dS UIR's issued from these group decompositions. (Projective)
Hilbert spaces carrying the UIR's (in some restricted sense) identify quantum
(""one-particle"") states spaces of dS elementary systems. Adopting a
well-established Fock procedure, based on the Wightman-G\""{a}rding axioms and
on analyticity requirements in the complexified Riemannian manifold, we proceed
with a consistent quantum field theory (QFT) formulation of elementary systems
in dS spacetime. This dS QFT formulation closely parallels the corresponding
Minkowskian one, while the usual spectral condition is replaced by a certain
geometric Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition equivalent to a precise thermal
manifestation of the associated ""vacuum"" states. We end our study by reviewing
a consistent and univocal definition of mass in dS relativity. This definition,
presented in terms of invariant parameters characterizing the dS UIR's,
accurately gives sense to terms like ""massive"" and ""massless"" fields in dS

observed by transit, by putting constraints on the masses and eccentricities of
the observed planets, or even constrain the existence of non-transiting
companions. However, TTVs can also prevent the detection of small planets in
transit surveys, or bias the recovered planetary and transit parameters. Here
we show that Kepler-1972 c, initially the ""not transit-like"" false positive
KOI-3184.02, is an Earth-sized planet whose orbit is perturbed by Kepler-1972 b
(initially KOI-3184.01). The pair is locked in a 3:2 Mean-motion resonance,
each planet displaying TTVs of more than 6h hours of amplitude over the
duration of the Kepler mission. The two planets have similar masses $m_b/m_c
=0.956_{-0.051}^{+0.056}$ and radii $R_b=0.802_{-0.041}^{+0.042}R_{Earth}$,
$R_c=0.868_{-0.050}^{+0.051}R_{Earth}$, and the whole system, including the
inner candidate KOI-3184.03, appear to be coplanar. Despite the faintness of
the signals (SNR of 1.35 for each transit of Kepler-1972 b and 1.10 for
Kepler-1972 c), we recovered the transits of the planets using the RIVERS
method, based on the recognition of the tracks of planets in river diagrams
using machine learning, and a photo-dynamic fit of the lightcurve. Recovering
the correct ephemerides of the planets is essential to have a complete picture
of the observed planetary systems. In particular, we show that in Kepler-1972,
not taking into account planet-planet interactions yields an error of $\sim
30\%$ on the radii of planets b and c, in addition to generating in-transit
scatter, which leads to mistake KOI3184.02 for a false positive. Alleviating
this bias is essential for an unbiased view of Kepler systems, some of the TESS

uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery, to achieve the maximum sum
Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF) with low subpacketization. It was shown in the
literature that under the constraint of uncoded placement and one-shot linear

schemes for this setting incurred either an exponential subpacketization order
in $K$, or required specific conditions in the system parameters $L$, $K$, $M$

multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA). Based on MAPDA and Latin
square, the first proposed scheme achieves the optimal sum-DoF $L+\frac{KM}{N}$
with the subpacketization of $K$ when $\frac{KM}{N}+L=K$. Subsequently, for the
general case we propose a transformation approach to construct an MAPDA from
any $g$-regular PDA (a class of PDA where each integer in the array occurs $g$

PDA corresponds to the Maddah-Ali and Niesen coded caching scheme, the
resulting scheme under the combinatorial structure of MAPDA can achieve the

width of [O I] are employed to infer the ejecta geometry and the expansion
velocity of the inner core. These two measurements are then compared with the
SN sub types, and further with the [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, which is used as an
indicator of the progenitor CO core mass. Based on the best fit results of the
[O I] profile, the objects are classified into different morphological groups,
and we conclude that the deviation from spherical symmetry is a common feature
for all types of SESNe. There is a hint (at about 1 sigma level) that the
distributions of the line profile fractions are different between canonical
SESNe and broad-line SNe Ic. A correlation between [O I] width and [O I]/[Ca
II] ratio is discerned, indicating that the oxygen-rich material tends to
expand faster for objects with a more massive CO core. Such a correlation can
be utilized to constrain the relation between the progenitor mass and the
kinetic energy of the explosion. Further, when [O I]/[Ca II] ratio increases,
the fraction of objects with Gaussian [O I] profile increases, while those with
double-peaked profile decreases. This phenomenon connects ejecta geometry and
the progenitor CO core mass.

radio jets, have been reported on Gpc scales, possibly arising from intrinsic
alignment of spin axes. Optical quasar polarisation appears to be
preferentially either aligned or orthogonal to the host large-scale structure,
specifically large quasar groups (LQGs). Using a sample of 71 LQGs at redshifts
$1.0 \leq z \leq 1.8$, we investigate whether LQGs themselves exhibit
correlated orientation. We find that LQG position angles (PAs) are unlikely to
be drawn from a uniform distribution ($p$-values $0.008 \lesssim p \lesssim
0.07$). The LQG PA distribution is bimodal, with median modes at
$\bar{\theta}\sim45\pm2^{\circ}, 136\pm2^{\circ}$, remarkably close to the mean
angles of quasar radio polarisation reported in two regions coincident with our
LQG sample. We quantify the degree of alignment in the PA data, and find that
LQGs are aligned and orthogonal across very large scales. The maximum
significance is $\simeq 0.8\%$ ($2.4\sigma$) at typical angular (proper)
separations of $\sim 30^{\circ}$ (1.6 Gpc). If the LQG orientation correlation
is real, it represents large-scale structure alignment over scales larger than
those predicted by cosmological simulations and at least an order of magnitude

while removing the scaphoid bone, is a standard surgery for the treatment of
advanced stages of wrist arthritis. Nowadays, it can be performed using a
dorsal approach by fixing a plate to the bones and a new radial approach is in
development. To date, there is no consensus on the biomechanically optimal and
most reliable surgical construct for four-corner arthrodesis. Methods: To
evaluate them biomechanically and thus assist the surgeon in choosing the best
implant orientation, radial or dorsal, the two different four-corner
arthrodesis surgical constructs were virtually simulated on a 3D finite element
model representing all major structures of the wrist. Two different realistic
load sets were applied to the model, representing common tasks for the elderly.
Findings: Results consistency was assessed by comparing with the literature the
force magnitude computed on the carpal bones. The Von Mises stress distribution
in the radial and dorsal plates were calculated. Stress concentration was
located at the plate-screw interface for both surgical constructs, with a
maximum stress value of 413 MPa for the dorsal plate compared to 326 MPa for
the radial plate, meaning that the stress levels are more unfavourable in the
dorsal approach. Interpretation: Although some bending stress was found in one
load case, the radial plate was mechanically more robust in the other load
case. Despite some limitations, this study provides, for the first time,
quantified evidence that the newly developed radial surgical construct is
mechanically as efficient as the dorsal surgical construct.

such non-collinear spin Hall currents can be observed for example in layered
Kagome Mn$_3$X (X = Ge, Sn) compounds. Moreover, by referring to atomistic spin
dynamics simulations we show that non-collinear spin currents can be used to
switch the chiral spin texture of Mn$_3$X in a deterministic way even in the
absence of an external magnetic field. Our theoretical prediction can be
readily tested in experiments, which will open a novel route toward electric
control of complex spin structures in non-collinear antiferromagnets.

we can observe a clear contrast between the blinking patterns of the two eyes.
Although previous works did utilize images/videos to detect this disorder, none
have explicitly focused on the eyes. Most of them require the entire face. One
obvious advantage of having an eye-focused detection system is that subjects'
anonymity is not at risk. Also, our AI decisions based on simple blinking
patterns make them explainable and straightforward. Specifically, we develop a
novel feature called blink similarity, which measures the similarity between
the two blinking patterns. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed feature is quite robust, for it helps in Bell's Palsy detection even
with very few labels. Our proposed eye-focused detection system is not only
cheaper but also more convenient than several existing methods.

least squares form and does neither require iterative procedures nor the
previous estimation of factors.
  We derive its asymptotic properties by finding out that the limiting

achieved by using the cross-sectional bootstrap. A Monte Carlo study indicates
good performance in terms of mean squared error. We apply our methodology to

CTGAN [3] separately to oversample the minority class samples. In order to
assess the efficacy of our proposed approach, we use a host of machine learning

augmenting the synthetic minority class data oversampled by GAN with the
undersampled majority class data obtained by one-class support vigor machine
(OCSVM) [4]. We combine both over-sampled data generated by GAN and the data
under-sampled by OCSVM [4] and pass the resultant data to classifiers. When we

training data while attaining near-optimal expected loss, has received much
attention in recent years, but still remains not fully understood beyond
well-specified linear regression setups. In this paper, we provide several new
results on when one can or cannot expect benign overfitting to occur, for both
regression and classification tasks. We consider a prototypical and rather
generic data model for benign overfitting of linear predictors, where an
arbitrary input distribution of some fixed dimension $k$ is concatenated with a
high-dimensional distribution. For linear regression which is not necessarily
well-specified, we show that the minimum-norm interpolating predictor (that
standard training methods converge to) is biased towards an inconsistent
solution in general, hence benign overfitting will generally not occur.
Moreover, we show how this can be extended beyond standard linear regression,
by an argument proving how the existence of benign overfitting on some
regression problems precludes its existence on other regression problems. We
then turn to classification problems, and show that the situation there is much
more favorable. Specifically, we prove that the max-margin predictor (to which
standard training methods are known to converge in direction) is asymptotically
biased towards minimizing a weighted \emph{squared hinge loss}. This allows us
to reduce the question of benign overfitting in classification to the simpler
question of whether this loss is a good surrogate for the misclassification
error, and use it to show benign overfitting in some new settings.

attractive theory that is free from the tadpole problem and the domain-wall
problem of $Z_3$-NMSSM, and can form an economic secluded dark matter (DM)
sector to naturally predict the DM experimental results. It also provides
mechanisms to easily and significantly weaken the constraints from the LHC
search for supersymmetric particles. These characteristics enable the theory to
explain the recently measured muon anomalous magnetic moment, $(g-2)_\mu$, in a
broad parameter space that is consistent with all experimental results and at
same time keeps the electroweak symmetry breaking natural. This work focuses on
a popular scenario of the GNMSSM in which the next-to-lightest CP-even Higgs
boson corresponds to the scalar discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).
Both analytic formulae and a sophisticated numerical study show that in order
to predict the scenario without significant tunings of relevant parameters, the
Higgsino mass $\mu_{tot} \lesssim 500~{\rm GeV}$ and $\tan \beta \lesssim 30$
are preferred. This character, if combined with the requirement to account for
the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, will entail some light sparticles and make the LHC
constraints very tight. As a result, this scenario can explain the muon
anomalous magnetic moment in very narrow corners of its parameter space.

intends to integrate it with the field of Computer-Aided Design. A central
problem in achieving this objective is the reconstruction of analysis-suitable
models from Computer-Aided Design models, which is in general a non-trivial and
time-consuming task. In this article, we present a novel spline construction,
that enables model reconstruction as well as simulation of high-order PDEs on
the reconstructed models. The proposed almost-$C^1$ are biquadratic splines on
fully unstructured quadrilateral meshes (without restrictions on placements or
number of extraordinary vertices). They are $C^1$ smooth almost everywhere,
that is, at all vertices and across most edges, and in addition almost (i.e.
approximately) $C^1$ smooth across all other edges. Thus, the splines form
$H^2$-nonconforming analysis-suitable discretization spaces. This is the
lowest-degree unstructured spline construction that can be used to solve
fourth-order problems. The associated spline basis is non-singular and has
several B-spline-like properties (e.g., partition of unity, non-negativity,
local support), the almost-$C^1$ splines are described in an explicit
B\'ezier-extraction-based framework that can be easily implemented. Numerical

low-dimensional models for averaged variables has long been an attractive task
in theoretical neuroscience. Recently developed reduction methods make it
possible to derive such models directly from the microscopic dynamics of
individual neurons. To simplify the reduction, the Cauchy distribution is
usually assumed for heterogeneous network parameters. Here we extend the
reduction method for a wider class of heterogeneities defined by the
$q$-Gaussian distribution. The shape of this distribution depends on the
Tsallis index $q$ and gradually changes from the Cauchy distribution to the
normal Gaussian distribution as this index changes. We derive the mean-field
equations for an inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons
with a $q$-Gaussian distributed excitability parameter. It is shown that the
dynamic modes of the network significantly depend on the form of the
distribution determined by the Tsallis index. The results obtained from the
mean-field equations are confirmed by numerical simulation of the microscopic
model.

a cost of an exponential amount of ancillary qubits. On the other hand, for
sparse quantum states with $d\geqslant2$ non-zero entries, we can reduce the
circuit depth to $\Theta(\log(nd))$ with $O(nd\log d)$ ancillary qubits. The
algorithm for sparse states is exponentially faster than best-known results and
the number of ancillary qubits is nearly optimal and only increases
polynomially with the system size. We discuss applications of the results in
different quantum computing tasks, such as Hamiltonian simulation, solving

find cases with exponential reductions of the circuit depth for all these three

of scenarios in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Accordingly, this work addresses
the problem of human gesture recognition. In particular, we focus on head and
eye gestures, and adopt an egocentric (first-person) perspective using eyewear
cameras. We argue that this egocentric view may offer a number of conceptual
and technical benefits over scene- or robot-centric perspectives. A
motion-based recognition approach is proposed, which operates at two temporal
granularities. Locally, frame-to-frame homographies are estimated with a
convolutional neural network (CNN). The output of this CNN is input to a long
short-term memory (LSTM) to capture longer-term temporal visual relationships,
which are relevant to characterize gestures. Regarding the configuration of the
network architecture, one particularly interesting finding is that using the
output of an internal layer of the homography CNN increases the recognition
rate with respect to using the homography matrix itself. While this work
focuses on action recognition, and no robot or user study has been conducted
yet, the system has been designed to meet real-time constraints. The
encouraging results suggest that the proposed egocentric perspective is viable,
and this proof-of-concept work provides novel and useful contributions to the
exciting area of HRI.

upstream motion planning of the motor cortical areas. We show that muscle
activity can be artificially generated based on motion features such as
position, velocity, and acceleration. For this purpose, we specifically develop
an approach based on a recurrent neural network trained in a supervised
learning session; additional neural network architectures are considered and
evaluated. The performance is evaluated by a new score called the zero-line
score. The latter adaptively rescales the loss function of the generated signal
for all channels by comparing the overall range of muscle activity and thus
dynamically evaluates similarities between both signals. The model achieves a
remarkable precision for previously trained motion while new motions that were
not trained before still have high accuracy. Further, these models are trained
on multiple subjects and thus are able to generalize across individuals. In
addition, we distinguish between a general model that has been trained on
several subjects, a subject-specific model, and a specific pre-trained model
that uses the general model as a basis and is adapted to a specific subject
afterward. The subject-specific generation of muscle activity can be further
exploited to improve the rehabilitation of neuromuscular diseases with
myoelectric prostheses and functional electric stimulation.

manner, they exhibit surprising robustness to variations in shape, size,

to variation of execution speeds, ranging from highly dynamic to quasi-static.
The robustness of the skills leads to compositional properties that enable
extended and robust manipulation programs. To explain the surprising robustness
of the in-hand manipulation skills, we performed a detailed, empirical analysis
of the skills' performance. From this analysis, we identify three principles
for skill design: 1) Exploiting the hardware's innate ability to drive
hard-to-model contact dynamics. 2) Taking actions to constrain these
interactions, funneling the system into a narrow set of possibilities. 3)
Composing such action sequences into complex manipulation programs. We believe
that these principles constitute an important foundation for robust robotic
in-hand manipulation, and possibly for manipulation in general.

value (VEV) of the energy-momentum tensor for a massive charged fermionic field
in background of 5-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The brane is
parallel to the AdS boundary and it divides the space into two regions with
distinct properties of the fermionic vacuum. For two types of boundary
conditions on the field operator and for the fields realizing two inequivalent
representations of the Clifford algebra, the brane-induced contributions in
VEVs are explicitly separated. The VEVs are even periodic functions of the
magnetic flux, confined in the core, with the period of flux quantum. Near the
horizon the FC and the vacuum energy-momentum tensor are dominated by the
brane-free contribution, whereas the brane-induced part dominates in the region
near the brane. Both the contributions vanish on the AdS boundary. At large
distances from the cosmic string, the topological contributions in the VEVs, as
functions of the proper distance, exhibit an inverse power-law decrease in the
region between the brane and AdS horizon and an exponential decrease in the
region between the brane and AdS boundary. We show that the FC and the vacuum

the rotational dynamics in the molecular-ionic crystal ammonium sulfate under

effect. Using quasielastic neutron scattering experiments, we show that
rotation of the ammonium cations is facilitated by pressure in the low-entropy
phase, with the rotational ""hopping"" motion increasing in frequency as the
pressure-induced phase transition is approached. We explain this unusual
behaviour in terms of the competing hydrogen-bond networks represented by the
two phases. This work includes the first results of a recently developed

Considering a very short time, we can approximately define the inertial frame

moving media system are definitely the traditional Maxwell's equations, which
are covariant and consistent with the two fundamental postulates of special

to us that the fields in the expanded Maxwell's equations cannot be in the same

explicitly, we derive the expanded Maxwell's equations for moving media system.
Furthermore, we discuss another possible variant of Maxwell's equations, which
has an additional coefficient $\alpha$ related to the media. However, it is
still subtle from theoretical point of view.

images pretrained on an annotated dataset would greatly decrease when testing
on another unannotated dataset because of the domain gap. Adversarial
generative methods, e.g., DualGAN, are utilized for unpaired image-to-image
translation to minimize the pixel-level domain gap, which is one of the common
approaches for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). However, the existing
image translation methods are facing two problems when performing RS images
translation: 1) ignoring the scale discrepancy between two RS datasets which
greatly affects the accuracy performance of scale-invariant objects, 2)
ignoring the characteristic of real-to-real translation of RS images which
brings an unstable factor for the training of the models. In this paper,
ResiDualGAN is proposed for RS images translation, where an in-network resizer
module is used for addressing the scale discrepancy of RS datasets, and a
residual connection is used for strengthening the stability of real-to-real
images translation and improving the performance in cross-domain semantic
segmentation tasks. Combined with an output space adaptation method, the
proposed method greatly improves the accuracy performance on common benchmarks,
which demonstrates the superiority and reliability of ResiDuanGAN. At the end

free conjunctive queries, and probabilistic databases where occurrences of
different facts are independent, which is the natural generalization of
tuple-independent probabilistic databases to the bag semantics setting. For set
semantics, the data complexity of this problem is well understood, even for the
more general class of unions of conjunctive queries: it is either in polynomial
time, or #P-hard, depending on the query (Dalvi & Suciu, JACM 2012).
  Due to potentially unbounded multiplicities, the bag probabilistic databases
we discuss are no longer finite objects, which requires a treatment of
representation mechanisms. Moreover, the answer to a Boolean query is a
probability distribution over non-negative integers, rather than a probability
distribution over {true, false}. Therefore, we discuss two flavors of
probabilistic query evaluation: computing expectations of answer tuple
multiplicities, and computing the probability that a tuple is contained in the
answer at most k times for some parameter k. Subject to mild technical
assumptions on the representation systems, it turns out that expectations are
easy to compute, even for unions of conjunctive queries. For query answer
probabilities, we obtain a dichotomy between solvability in polynomial time and
#P-hardness for self-join free conjunctive queries.

characteristics such as synaptic activation and criticality, and on the voltage
used to read resistance states during inference. We propose a system software

optimization formulation which aims to implement synaptic weights that have
more activations and are critical, i.e., those that have high impact on
accuracy on NVM cells that are exposed to lower voltages during inference. In
this way, we increase the time interval between two consecutive reprogramming

Eddington ratio, we find more variable RQQs, which are known to be X-ray
relatively brighter, show tentatively weaker radio emission, contrary to the
linear X-ray/radio correlation if the radio emission is from or driven by the
corona. The discovery also suggests that if the radio emission in RQQs is
driven by AGN activity (such as weak jet), the underlying driving process is
independent to the disc turbulence which drives UV/optical variability and
probably also corona heating. Alternatively, the radio emission could be due to

Kepler-11, Kepler-102 and Kepler-80 and estimate the volatile mass fraction of
their planets assuming a volatile layer constituted of water in steam and
supercritical phases. Our interior-atmosphere model takes into account the
effects of irradiation on the surface conditions. K2-138 inner planets present
an increasing volatile mass fraction with distance from its host star, while
the outer planets present an approximately constant water content. This is
similar to the trend observed in TRAPPIST-1 in a previous analysis with the
same interior-atmosphere model. The Kepler-102 system could potentially present
this trend. In all multiplanetary systems, the low volatile mass fraction of
the inner planets could be due to atmospheric escape while the higher volatile
mass fraction of the outer planets can be the result of accretion of ice-rich
material in the vicinity of the ice line with later inward migration.
Kepler-102 and Kepler-80 present inner planets with high core mass fractions
which could be due to mantle evaporation, impacts or formation in the vicinity
of rocklines.

future player performance when transferred to another club within and between
different leagues. In addition to being the most valuable prediction a team

take into consideration: a) differences in playing style between the player's
current team and target team, b) differences in style and ability of other
players on each team, c) differences in league quality and style, and d) the
role the player is desired to play. In this paper, we present a method which
addresses these issues and enables us to make accurate predictions of future
performance. Our Transfer Portal model utilizes a personalized neural network
accounting for both stylistic and ability level input representations for
players, teams, and leagues to simulate future player performance at any chosen

player and team representations over time which enables us to generate
predictions for rising stars with small amounts of data.

load in peak-traffic hours. In the coded caching literature, the notion of
privacy is considered only against demands. On the motivation that multi-round
transmissions almost appear everywhere in real communication systems, this
paper formulates the coded caching problem with private demands and caches.
Only one existing private caching scheme, which is based on introducing virtual
users, can preserve the privacy of demands and caches simultaneously, but with
an extremely large subpacketization exponential to the product of the numbers
of users and files in the system. In order to reduce the subpacketization while
satisfying the privacy constraint, we propose a novel approach which constructs
private coded caching schemes through private information retrieval (PIR).
Based on this approach, we propose novel schemes with private demands and
caches which have a subpacketization level in the order exponential to $K$
(number of users) against $NK$ in the virtual user scheme where $N$ stands for
the numbers of files. As a by-product, for the coded caching problem with
private demands, a private coded caching scheme could be obtained from the
proposed approach, which generally improves the memory-load tradeoff of the
private coded caching scheme by Yan and Tuninetti.

  simulations",,,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solar jets are observed as collimated plasma beams over a large range of
temperatures and wavelengths. They have been observed in Halpha and optical
lines for more than 50 years and called surges. The term ""jet"" comes from X-ray
observations after the launch of the Yohkoh satellite in 1991. They are the
means of transporting energy through the heliosphere and participate to the
corona heating and the acceleration of solar wind. Several characteristics have
been derived about their velocities, their rates of occurrence, and their
relationship with CMEs. However, the initiation mechanism of jets, e.g.
emerging flux, flux cancellation, or twist, is still debated. In the last
decade coordinated observations of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph
(IRIS) with the instruments on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) allow
to make a step forward for understanding the trigger of jets and the
relationship between hot jets and cool surges. We observe at the same time the
development of 2D and 3D MHD numerical simulations to interpret the results.
This paper summarizes recent studies of jets showing the loci of magnetic
reconnection in null points or in bald patch regions forming a current sheet.
In the pre-jet phase a twist is frequently detected by the existence of a mini
filament close to the dome of emerging flux. The twist can also be transferred
to the jet from a flux rope in the vicinity of the reconnection by slippage of
the polarities. Bidirectional flows are detected at the reconnection sites. We
show the role of magnetic currents detected in the footprints of flux rope and
quasi-separatrix layers for initiating the jets.
  We select a few studies and show that with the same observations, different
interpretations are possible based on different approaches e.g. non linear
force free field extrapolation or 3D MHD simulation.

supervision is beneficial, it is not entirely reliable, for the results are
quite sensitive to the neighboring images considered. In this paper, we combine
it with a self-awareness phenomenon to mitigate this issue. By self-awareness
here, we refer to the solution derived from the image itself in the form of
saliency cue, which can also be unreliable if applied alone. Nevertheless,
combining these two paradigms together can lead to a better co-localization
ability. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic mediator that adaptively strikes
a proper balance between the two static solutions to provide an optimal
solution. Therefore, we call this method \textit{ASOC}: Adaptive Self-aware
Object Co-localization. We perform exhaustive experiments on several benchmark
datasets and validate that weak-supervision supplemented with self-awareness
has superior performance outperforming several compared competing methods.

or proto-planets, is revisited by means of the recent method of the Spectral
Web. The cylindrical accretion disk differential equation is shown to be
governed by the forward and backward Doppler-shifted continuous Alfv\'en
spectra $\Omega_{\rm A}^\pm \equiv m \Omega \pm \omega_{\rm A}$, where
$\omega_{\rm A}$ is the static Alfv\'en frequency. It is crucial to take
non-axisymmetry ($m \ne 0$) and super-Alfv\'enic rotation of the Doppler frames
($|m\Omega| \gg |\omega_{\rm A}|$) into account. The continua $\Omega_{\rm
A}^+$ and $\Omega_{\rm A}^-$ then overlap, ejecting a plethora of
Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities (SARIs). In-depth analysis for small
inhomogeneity shows that the two Alfv\'en singularities reduce the extent of
the modes to sizes much smaller than the width of the accretion disk.
Generalization for large inhomogeneity leads to the completely unprecedented
result that, for mode numbers $|k| \gg |m|$, any complex $\omega$ in a wide
neighborhood of the real axis is an approximate `eigenvalue'. The difference
with genuine eigenmodes is that the amount of complementary energy to excite
the modes is tiny, $|W_{\rm com}| \le c$, with $c$ the machine accuracy of the
computation. This yields a multitude of two-dimensional continua of
quasi-discrete modes: quasi-continuum SARIs. We conjecture that the onset of 3D
turbulence in magnetized accretion disks is governed, not by the excitation of
discrete axisymmetric Magneto-Rotational Instabilities, but by the excitation
of modes from these two-dimensional continua of quasi-discrete non-axisymmetric
Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities.

polyelectrolyte gel and a salt bath is studied using asymptotic and numerical
methods. Specifically, matched asymptotic expansions, based on the smallness of
the Debye length relative to the typical gel dimensions, are used to construct
solutions of the governing equations and derive electroneutral models with
consistent jump conditions across the gel-bath interface. A general approach
for solving the equations of incompressible nonlinear elasticity in a curved
boundary layer is developed and used to resolve the gel mechanics in the EDL. A
critical feature of the model is that it accounts for phase separation within
the gel, which gives rise to diffuse interfaces with a characteristic thickness
described by the Kuhn length. We show that the solutions of the electroneutral
model can only be asymptotically matched to the solutions in the EDL, in
general, when the Kuhn length greatly exceeds the Debye length. Conversely, if
the Debye length is similar to or larger than the Kuhn length, then the entire
gel can self-organise into periodic, electrically charged domains via phase
separation. The breakdown of electroneutrality demonstrates that the commonly
invoked electroneutral assumption must be used with caution, as it generally
only applies when the Debye length is much smaller than the Kuhn length.

the Braginskii model, and we also consider a 22-moment model. Both models are
formulated for general multi-species plasmas with arbitrary masses and
temperatures, where all the fluid moments are described by their evolution
equations. The 21-moment model contains two ""heat flux vectors"" (3rd and
5th-order moments) and two ""viscosity-tensors"" (2nd and 4th-order moments). The
Braginskii model is then obtained as a particular case of a one ion-electron
plasma with similar temperatures, with de-coupled heat fluxes and
viscosity-tensors expressed in a quasi-static approximation. We provide all the
numerical values of the Braginskii model in a fully analytic form (together
with the 4th and 5th-order moments). For multi-species plasmas, the model makes
calculation of transport coefficients straightforward. Formulation in fluid
moments (instead of Hermite moments) is also suitable for implementation into
existing numerical codes. It is emphasized that it is the quasi-static
approximation which makes some Braginskii coefficients divergent in a
weakly-collisional regime. Importantly, we show that the heat fluxes and
viscosity-tensors are coupled even in the linear approximation, and that the
fully contracted (scalar) perturbations of the 4th-order moment, which are
accounted for in the 22-moment model, modify the energy exchange rates. We also
provide several Appendices, which can be useful as a guide for deriving the

to work output, the input consisting of a single oscillator mode prepared in a
hot thermal state along with few much colder oscillator modes. We wish to
achieve heat to work conversion in the setup while avoiding the use of a
working substance (medium) or macroscopic heat baths. The core issues we
consider, taking account of the quantum nature of the setup, are: (i) How and
to what extent can information act as work resource or, conversely, be
redundant for work extraction? (ii) What is the optimal way of extracting work
via information acquired by measurements? (iii) What is the bearing of
information on the efficiency-power tradeoff achievable in such setups? We
compare the efficiency of work extraction and the limitations of power in our
minimal setup by unitary (reversible) manipulations and by different, generic,
measurement strategies of the hot and cold modes. For each strategy the rapport
of work and information extraction is found and the cost of information erasure
is allowed for. The possibilities of work extraction without information
acquisition, via non-selective measurements, are also analyzed. Overall, we
present, by generalizing a method based on optimized homodyning that we have
recently proposed, the following insight: extraction of work by observation and
feedforward (WOF) that only measures a small fraction of the input, is clearly
advantageous to the conceivable alternatives. Our results may become a basis of
a practical strategy of converting thermal noise to useful work in optical
setups, such as coherent amplifiers of thermal light, as well as in their

The circular motion of Weyl nodes induces magnetic charge current in the

pump. Experimentally, this phenomenon is similar to spin motive force, which is
an electric current induced by magnetic precision in the presence of the
spatial gradient of magnetization. However, unlike the conventional spin motive
force, this current occurs without a magnetization gradient. The result
demonstrates a nontrivial interplay between the topological electronic state

study of saliency-based explanations over textual data. Feature-attribution
explanations of text models aim to communicate which parts of the input text
were more influential than others towards the model decision. Many current
explanation methods, such as gradient-based or Shapley value-based methods,
provide measures of importance which are well-understood mathematically. But
how does a person receiving the explanation (the explainee) comprehend it? And
does their understanding match what the explanation attempted to communicate?
We empirically investigate the effect of various factors of the input, the
feature-attribution explanation, and visualization procedure, on laypeople's
interpretation of the explanation. We query crowdworkers for their
interpretation on tasks in English and German, and fit a GAMM model to their
responses considering the factors of interest. We find that people often
mis-interpret the explanations: superficial and unrelated factors, such as word
length, influence the explainees' importance assignment despite the explanation
communicating importance directly. We then show that some of this distortion
can be attenuated: we propose a method to adjust saliencies based on model
estimates of over- and under-perception, and explore bar charts as an
alternative to heatmap saliency visualization. We find that both approaches can
attenuate the distorting effect of specific factors, leading to
better-calibrated understanding of the explanation.

consistent with unitarity, reflected in the non-trivial fact that beneath the
critical dimension, the residues of the amplitudes on massive poles can be
expanded in partial waves with all positive coefficients. While this follows
(rather indirectly) from the no-ghost theorem, the simplicity of the statement
and its fundamental importance for the physical consistency of string theory
begs for a more direct and elementary understanding. In this note we take a
step in this direction by presenting a new expression for the partial wave
coefficients of string amplitudes, given by surprisingly simple double/triple
contour integrals for open/closed strings. This representation allows us to
directly prove unitarity of all superstring theories in $D \leq 6$ spacetime
dimensions, and can also be used to determine various asymptotics of the
partial waves at large mass levels.

many disparate natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, fine tuning

Simultaneously, many realistic NLP problems are ""few shot"", without a
sufficiently large training set. In this work, we propose a novel conditional
neural process-based approach for few-shot text classification that learns to
transfer from other diverse tasks with rich annotation. Our key idea is to
represent each task using gradient information from a base model and to train
an adaptation network that modulates a text classifier conditioned on the task
representation. While previous task-aware few-shot learners represent tasks by
input encoding, our novel task representation is more powerful, as the gradient
captures input-output relationships of a task. Experimental results show that
our approach outperforms traditional fine-tuning, sequential transfer learning,
and state-of-the-art meta learning approaches on a collection of diverse
few-shot tasks. We further conducted analysis and ablations to justify our
design choices.

specific (and possibly renewable) expiration time. State-of-the-art models for
TTL caches assume zero object fetch delay, i.e., the time required to fetch a
requested object that is not in cache from a different cache or the origin
server. Particularly, in cache hierarchies, this delay has a significant impact
on performance metrics such as the object hit probability. Recent work suggests
that the impact of the object fetch delay on the cache performance will
continue to increase due to the scaling mismatch between shrinking
inter-request times (due to higher data center link rates) in contrast to
processing and memory access times.
  In this paper, we analyze tree-based cache hierarchies with random object
fetch delays and provide an exact analysis of the corresponding object hit
probability. Our analysis allows understanding the impact of random delays and
TTLs on cache metrics for a wide class of request stream models characterized
through Markov arrival processes. This is expressed through a metric that we
denote delay impairment of the hit probability. In addition, we analyze and
extend state-of-the-art approximations of the hit probability to take the delay
into account. We provide numerical and trace-based simulation-based evaluation
results showing that larger TTLs do not efficiently compensate for the
detrimental effect of object fetch delays. Our evaluations also show that
unlike our exact model the state-of-the-art approximations do not capture the
impact of the object fetch delay well especially for cache hierarchies.
Surprisingly, we show that the impact of this delay on the hit probability is
not monotonic but depends on the request stream properties, as well as, the
TTL.

starting from microscopic interactions, by means of cavity methods. We
illustrate the procedure first on the simple binary case, and we then apply it
successfully to ternary systems, in which the naive mean field approximations
are proved inadequate. We then demonstrate the agreement with lattice model
simulations, to finally contrast our theory also with experiments of coacervate
formation by associative de-mixing of nucleotides and poly-lysine in aqueous

2-commodity flow problem with only a small blow-up in size. Under mild
assumptions similar to those employed by modern fast solvers for linear
programs, our reduction causes only a polylogarithmic multiplicative increase
in the size of the program and runs in nearly-linear time. Our reduction
applies to high-accuracy approximation algorithms and exact algorithms. Given
an approximate solution to the 2-commodity flow problem, we can extract a
solution to the linear program in linear time with only a polynomial factor
increase in the error. This implies that any algorithm that solves the
2-commodity flow problem can solve linear programs in essentially the same
time. Given a directed graph with edge capacities and two source-sink pairs,
the goal of the 2-commodity flow problem is to maximize the sum of the flows
routed between the two source-sink pairs subject to edge capacities and flow
conservation. A 2-commodity flow can be directly written as a linear program,
and thus we establish a nearly-tight equivalence between these two classes of
problems.
  Our proof follows the outline of Itai's polynomial-time reduction of a linear
program to a 2-commodity flow problem (JACM'78). Itai's reduction shows that
exactly solving 2-commodity flow and exactly solving linear programming are
polynomial-time equivalent. We improve Itai's reduction to nearly preserve the
problem representation size in each step. In addition, we establish an error
bound for approximately solving each intermediate problem in the reduction, and
show that the accumulated error is polynomially bounded. We remark that our
reduction does not run in strongly polynomial time and that it is open whether
2-commodity flow and linear programming are equivalent in strongly polynomial
time.

studying the latency of an uplink connection from a multi-sensor IoT device to

not automatically satisfied by the most efficient structural descriptors,

work, we present a general optimization method capable of inverting any local

critical that researchers and ML engineers think about the inherent biases in
the data that may be perpetuated by the model. Recently, many studies have
shown that such biases are also imbibed in Graph Neural Network (GNN) models if
the input graph is biased, potentially to the disadvantage of underserved and
underrepresented communities. In this work, we aim to mitigate the bias learned
by GNNs by jointly optimizing two different loss functions: one for the task of
link prediction and one for the task of demographic parity. We further
implement three different techniques inspired by graph modification approaches:
the Global Fairness Optimization (GFO), Constrained Fairness Optimization
(CFO), and Fair Edge Weighting (FEW) models. These techniques mimic the effects
of changing underlying graph structures within the GNN and offer a greater
degree of interpretability over more integrated neural network methods. Our
proposed models emulate microscopic or macroscopic edits to the input graph
while training GNNs and learn node embeddings that are both accurate and fair
under the context of link recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach on four real world datasets and show that we can improve the
recommendation fairness by several factors at negligible cost to link
prediction accuracy.

relevance ranges from the study of entanglement in biological systems to noise
mitigation in quantum computers. Here, we put forward the first fully quantum
simulation of dissipative collective phenomena on a real quantum computer,
based on the recently introduced multipartite collision model. First, we
theoretically study the accuracy of this algorithm on near-term quantum
computers with noisy gates, and we derive some rigorous error bounds that
depend on the timestep of the collision model and on the gate errors. These
bounds can be employed to estimate the necessary resources for the efficient
quantum simulation of the collective dynamics. Then, we implement the algorithm
on some IBM quantum computers to simulate superradiance and subradiance between
a pair of qubits. Our experimental results successfully display the emergence
of collective effects in the quantum simulation. In addition, we analyze the
noise properties of the gates that we employ in the algorithm by means of full
process tomography, with the aim of improving our understanding of the errors
in the near-term devices that are currently accessible to worldwide
researchers. We obtain the values of the average gate fidelity, unitarity,
incoherence and diamond error, and we establish a connection between them and
the accuracy of the experimentally simulated state. Moreover, we build a noise
model based on the results of the process tomography for two-qubit gates and
show that its performance is comparable with the noise model provided by IBM.
Finally, we observe that the scaling of the error as a function of the number
of gates is favorable, but at the same time reaching the threshold of the
diamond errors for quantum fault tolerant computation may still be orders of
magnitude away in the devices that we employ.

to the exponential growth -- with the size of the system -- of the number of
parameters needed to encode its state. Nonetheless, in order to understand the
complex phenomenology that can be observed in these systems, it is often
sufficient to consider dynamical or stationary properties of local observables
or, at most, of few-body correlation functions. These quantities are typically
studied by singling out a specific subsystem of interest and regarding the
remainder of the many-body system as an effective bath. In the simplest
scenario, the subsystem dynamics, which is in fact an open quantum dynamics,
can be approximated through Markovian quantum master equations. Here, we
formulate the problem of finding the generator of the subsystem dynamics as a
variational problem, which we solve using the standard toolbox of machine
learning for optimization. This dynamical or ``Lindblad"" generator provides the
relevant dynamical parameters for the subsystem of interest. Importantly, the
algorithm we develop is constructed such that the learned generator implements
a physically consistent open quantum time-evolution. We exploit this to learn
the generator of the dynamics of a subsystem of a many-body system subject to a
unitary quantum dynamics. We explore the capability of our method to recover
the time-evolution of a two-body subsystem and exploit the physical consistency
of the generator to make predictions on the stationary state of the subsystem

change from one seizure to the next within the same patient. Importantly,
within-patient seizure evolutions do not change randomly over time, but instead
appear to fluctuate over circadian and slower timescales. However, the specific
timescales of this variability, as well as the specific seizure characteristics
that change over time, are unclear.
  Here we analysed this within-patient seizure variability in 10 patients with
chronic intracranial EEG recordings (185-767 days of recording time, 57-452
analysed seizures/patient). We characterised the seizure evolutions as
sequences of a finite number of functional network states. We then compared
seizure state occurrence and seizure state duration to (1) time since
implantation and (2) patient-specific circadian and multidien cycles in
interictal spike rate, which were extracted using empirical mode decomposition.
  In most patients, the occurrence or duration of at least one state was
associated with the time since implantation (8 and 9 patients for state
occurrence and state duration, respectively). Additionally, some patients also
had one or more states that were associated with phases of circadian and/or
multidien spike rate cycles (4 and 7 patients for state occurrence and state
duration, respectively). A given state's occurrence and duration were not
usually associated with the same timescale.
  Our results suggest that time-varying factors modulate within-patient seizure
evolutions over multiple timescales, with separate processes modulating a
seizure state's occurrence and duration. These findings provide new insight
into the patterns and mechanisms of intra-patient seizure variability, with
potential implications for forecasting and treating seizures.

automated driving systems. We present a method to study and evaluate race
drivers on a driver-in-the-loop simulator by analysing tire grip potential
exploitation. Given initial data from a simulator run, two optimiser based on
physical models maximise the horizontal vehicle acceleration or the tire
forces, respectively. An overall performance score, a vehicle-trajectory score
and a handling score are introduced to evaluate drivers. Our method is thereby
completely track independent and can be used from one single corner up to a
large data set. We apply the proposed method to a motorsport data set
containing over 1200 laps from seven professional race drivers and two amateur
drivers whose lap times are 10-20% slower. The difference to the professional
drivers comes mainly from their inferior handling skills and not their choice
of driving line. A downside of the presented method for certain applications is
an extensive computation time. Therefore, we propose a Long-short-term memory
(LSTM) neural network to estimate the driver evaluation scores. We show that
the neural network is accurate and robust with a root-mean-square error between
2-5% and can replace the optimisation based method. The time for processing the
data set considered in this work is reduced from 68 hours to 12 seconds, making
the neural network suitable for real-time application.

done before. The raw data are relatively uncontrolled, leading to caveats that
should guide future, more tailored experiments. Aspects of the results may
suggest a modification to Born's rule at very small wavefunction, with possibly
profound implications for the detection of extremely rare events such as proton
decay, but other explanations are not ruled out. Speculatively, I introduce two
candidate small-wavefunction Born rule modifications, a hard cutoff, and an
offset model with a stronger underlying physical rationale. Track distributions
from decays in cloud chambers represent a previously unappreciated way to probe
the foundations of quantum mechanics, and a novel case of wavefunctions with

wide adoption of such machine learning applications also causes concerns in
terms of data privacy. These concerns are addressed by the recent ""General Data
Protection Regulation"" (GDPR) in Europe, which requires companies to delete
personal user data upon request when users enforce their ""right to be
forgotten"". Many researchers argue that this deletion obligation does not only
apply to the data stored in primary data stores such as relational databases
but also requires an update of machine learning models whose training set
included the personal data to delete. We explore this direction in the context
of a sequential recommendation task called Next Basket Recommendation (NBR),
where the goal is to recommend a set of items based on a user's purchase
history. We design efficient algorithms for incrementally and decrementally
updating a state-of-the-art next basket recommendation model in response to
additions and deletions of user baskets and items. Furthermore, we discuss an
efficient, data-parallel implementation of our method in the Spark Structured
Streaming system. We evaluate our implementation on a variety of real-world
datasets, where we investigate the impact of our update techniques on several
ranking metrics and measure the time to perform model updates. Our results show
that our method provides constant update time efficiency with respect to an
additional user basket in the incremental case, and linear efficiency in the
decremental case where we delete existing baskets. With modest computational
resources, we are able to update models with a latency of around
0.2~milliseconds regardless of the history size in the incremental case, and
less than one millisecond in the decremental case.

rate worldwide. For the early detection of the risk of AFib, we have developed
an automatic detection system based on deep neural networks. For achieving
better classification, it is mandatory to have good pre-processing of
physiological signals. Keeping this in mind, we have proposed a two-fold study.
First, an end-to-end model is proposed to denoise the electrocardiogram signals
using denoising autoencoders (DAE). To achieve denoising, we have used three
networks including, convolutional neural network (CNN), dense neural network
(DNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Compared the three models and CNN
based DAE performance is found to be better than the other two. Therefore, the
signals denoised by the CNN based DAE were used to train the deep neural
networks for classification. Three neural networks' performance has been
evaluated using accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and signal to noise ratio
(SNR) as the evaluation criteria.
  The proposed end-to-end deep learning model for detecting atrial fibrillation
in this study has achieved an accuracy rate of 99.20%, a specificity of 99.50%,
a sensitivity of 99.50%, and a true positive rate of 99.00%. The average
accuracy of the algorithms we compared is 96.26%, and our algorithm's accuracy

classification network performed better as compared to the other two.
Additionally, the model is computationally efficient for real-time

The proposed model was also tested on unseen dataset with different proportions
