nodal dropouts of the first convolutional layer. Using an adversarial targeting
algorithm, we correlate these neurons with the distribution of adversarial
attacks on the network. Adversarial robustness of neural networks has gained
significant attention in recent times and highlights intrinsic weaknesses of
deep learning networks against carefully constructed distortion applied to
input images. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art
image classification models trained on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets against
the fast gradient sign method attack, a simple yet effective method of
deceiving neural networks. Our method identifies the specific neurons of a
network that are most affected by the adversarial attack being applied. We,
therefore, propose to make fragile neurons more robust against these attacks by
compressing features within robust neurons and amplifying the fragile neurons
proportionally.

for reducing the computational cost of self-attention mechanisms in Transformer
architectures. MCA exploits the fact that the importance of each token in an
input sequence varies with respect to their attention scores; thus, some degree
of error can be tolerable when encoding tokens with low attention. Using
approximate matrix multiplication, MCA applies different error bounds to encode
input tokens such that those with low attention scores are computed with
relaxed precision, whereas errors of salient elements are minimized. MCA can
operate in parallel with other attention optimization schemes and does not
require model modification. We study the theoretical error bounds and
demonstrate that MCA reduces attention complexity (in FLOPS) for various
Transformer models by up to 11$\times$ in GLUE benchmarks without compromising

a formally defined white noise space measure. Then, for the corresponding
conditional autoregressive model, we derive a closed form formula for its

vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs). However, existing PIM accelerators suffer
from frequent and energy-intensive analog-to-digital (A/D) conversions,
severely limiting their performance. This paper presents a new PIM architecture
to efficiently accelerate deep learning tasks by minimizing the required A/D

PIM accelerators, based on which a new dataflow is proposed to remarkably
reduce the required A/D conversions for VMMs by extending shift and add (S+A)

leverage a neural approximation method to design both analog accumulation

highly-efficient manner. Finally, we apply them to build an RRAM-based PIM
accelerator (i.e., \textbf{Neural-PIM}) upon the proposed analog dataflow and
evaluate its system-level performance. Evaluations on different benchmarks
demonstrate that Neural-PIM can improve energy efficiency by 5.36x (1.73x) and
speed up throughput by 3.43x (1.59x) without losing accuracy, compared to the

acceleration of the universe is a compelling task of modern fundamental
cosmology. Recently Fernandes \textit{et al.} presented low redshift
observational constraints on a scale invariant model by Maeder.
Phenomenologically this can be interpreted as a bimetric theory with a
time-dependent cosmological constant. It was shown that a matter density
$\Omega_m\sim0.3$ is a poor fit to the data, and the best-fit model would
require a fluid with a much smaller density and a significantly positive
equation of state parameter. This model is a particular case of an earlier and
broader class of models by Canuto \textit{et al.}, which we study here.
Specifically, we consider it in two distinct scenarios: as a genuine
alternative to $\Lambda$CDM (i.e., without any cosmological constant) and as a
parametric extension thereof (where both a cosmological constant and the new
mechanism can coexist, and the relative contributions of both are determined by
the data). We find that the first scenario can in principle fit the
low-redshift data (but a good fit would require values of model parameters,
such as the matter equation of state, in conflict with other data), while in
the second one the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM is constrained to be small.

kernel methods or generalized additive models. Most of these methods break down
if the predictor space has more than a few dimensions or if the regression
function of extreme quantiles is complex. We propose a method for extreme

regularize its variability in the predictor space. Simulation studies show that
our ERF outperforms both classical quantile regression methods and existing

quality. However, the long-distance reordering would make the SimulMT models

algorithms. Assuming participants are inherently self-interested, well designed
rules can help to increase social welfare. Many algorithms for online markets
are based on prices: the seller is responsible for posting prices while buyers
make purchases which are most profitable given the posted prices. To make
adjustments to the market the seller is allowed to update prices at certain
timepoints.
  Posted prices are an intuitive way to design a market. Despite the fact that
each buyer acts selfishly, the seller's goal is often assumed to be that of
social welfare maximization. Berger, Eden and Feldman recently considered the
case of a market with only three buyers where each buyer has a fixed number of
goods to buy and the profit of a bought bundle of items is the sum of profits
of the items in the bundle. For such markets, Berger et. al. showed that the
seller can maximize social welfare by dynamically updating posted prices before
arrival of each buyer. B\'{e}rczi, B\'{e}rczi-Kov\'{a}cs and Sz\""{o}gi showed
that the social welfare can be maximized also when each buyer is ready to buy
at most two items.

buyer is ready to buy up to three items. We also show that a dynamic pricing is

sparsification, approximates a matrix $A$ with a sparse matrix $A'$. Achlioptas
and McSherry [2007] initiated a long line of work on spectral-norm
sparsification, which aims to guarantee that $\|A'-A\|\leq \epsilon \|A\|$ for
error parameter $\epsilon>0$. Various forms of matrix approximation motivate
considering this problem with a guarantee according to the Schatten $p$-norm
for general $p$, which includes the spectral norm as the special case
$p=\infty$.
  We investigate the relation between fixed but different $p\neq q$, that is,
whether sparsification in the Schatten $p$-norm implies (existentially and/or
algorithmically) sparsification in the Schatten $q\text{-norm}$ with similar
sparsity. An affirmative answer could be tremendously useful, as it will
identify which value of $p$ to focus on. Our main finding is a surprising
contrast between this question and the analogous case of $\ell_p$-norm
sparsification for vectors: For vectors, the answer is affirmative for $p<q$
and negative for $p>q$, but for matrices we answer negatively for almost all
$p\neq q$. In addition, our explicit constructions may be of independent
interest.

into malware detection, resulting in great effectiveness. Recent work is
considering hybrid models and multi-view learning. However, they use only
simple features, limiting the accuracy of these approaches in practice. In this
paper, we propose DeepCatra, a multi-view learning approach for Android malware
detection, whose model consists of a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and a graph
neural network (GNN) as subnets. The two subnets rely on features extracted
from statically computed call traces leading to critical APIs derived from
public vulnerabilities. For each Android app, DeepCatra first constructs its
call graph and computes call traces reaching critical APIs. Then, temporal
opcode features used by the BiLSTM subnet are extracted from the call traces,
while flow graph features used by the GNN subnet are constructed from all the
call traces and inter-component communications. We evaluate the effectiveness
of DeepCatra by comparing it with several state-of-the-art detection
approaches. Experimental results on over 18,000 real-world apps and prevalent
malware show that DeepCatra achieves considerable improvement, e.g., 2.7% to
14.6% on F1-measure, which demonstrates the feasibility of DeepCatra in
practice.

Dirichlet polynomial, regarded as an empirical distribution. Indeed, entropy
can be extracted from any $d\in\mathsf{Dir}$ by a two-step process, where the
first step is a rig homomorphism out of $\mathsf{Dir}$, the \emph{set} of
Dirichlet polynomials, with rig structure given by standard addition and
multiplication. In this short note, we show that this rig homomorphism can be
upgraded to a rig \emph{functor}, when we replace the set of Dirichlet
polynomials by the \emph{category} of ordinary (Cartesian) polynomials.
  In the Cartesian case, the process has three steps. The first step is a rig
functor $\mathbf{Poly}^{\mathbf{Cart}}\to\mathbf{Poly}$ sending a polynomial
$p$ to $\dot{p}\mathcal{y}$, where $\dot{p}$ is the derivative of $p$. The
second is a rig functor
$\mathbf{Poly}\to\mathbf{Set}\times\mathbf{Set}^{\text{op}}$, sending a
polynomial $q$ to the pair $(q(1),\Gamma(q))$, where
$\Gamma(q)=\mathbf{Poly}(q,\mathcal{y})$ can be interpreted as the global
sections of $q$ viewed as a bundle, and $q(1)$ as its base. To make this
precise we define what appears to be a new distributive monoidal structure on
$\mathbf{Set}\times\mathbf{Set}^{\text{op}}$, which can be understood
geometrically in terms of rectangles. The last step, as for Dirichlet
polynomials, is simply to extract the entropy as a real number from a pair of
sets $(A,B)$; it is given by $\log A-\log \sqrt[A]{B}$ and can be thought of as
the log aspect ratio of the rectangle.

Broadcast (BRB). This abstraction is central in the design and implementation
of fault-tolerant distributed systems, as many fault-tolerant distributed
applications require communication with provable guarantees on message
deliveries. Our study focuses on fault-tolerant implementations for
message-passing systems that are prone to process-failures, such as crashes and
malicious behavior.
  At PODC 1983, Bracha and Toueg, in short, BT, solved the BRB problem. BT has
optimal resilience since it can deal with t < n/3 Byzantine processes, where n
is the number of processes. The present work aims at the design of an even more
robust solution than BT by expanding its fault-model with self-stabilization, a
vigorous notion of fault-tolerance. In addition to tolerating Byzantine and
communication failures, self-stabilizing systems can recover after the
occurrence of arbitrary transient-faults. These faults represent any violation
of the assumptions according to which the system was designed to operate
(provided that the algorithm code remains intact).
  We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first self-stabilizing
Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) solution for repeated BRB in signature-free
message-passing systems (that follows BT's problem specifications). Our
contribution includes a self-stabilizing variation on a BT that solves a
single-instance BRB for asynchronous systems. We also consider the problem of
recycling instances of single-instance BRB. Our self-stabilizing BFT recycling
for time-free systems facilitates the concurrent handling of a predefined
number of BRB invocations and, by this way, can serve as the basis for
self-stabilizing BFT consensus.

societal challenges where groups need to coordinate to avoid the risk of a
disastrous outcome. Multi-agent systems incurring such dilemmas face
difficulties achieving cooperation and often converge to sub-optimal,
risk-dominant solutions where everyone defects. In this paper we investigate
the consequences of risk diversity in groups of agents learning to play CRDs.
We find that risk diversity places new challenges to cooperation that are not
observed in homogeneous groups. We show that increasing risk diversity
significantly reduces overall cooperation and hinders collective target
achievement. It leads to asymmetrical changes in agents' policies -- i.e. the
increase in contributions from individuals at high risk is unable to compensate
for the decrease in contributions from individuals at low risk -- which overall
reduces the total contributions in a population. When comparing RL behaviors to
rational individualistic and social behaviors, we find that RL populations
converge to fairer contributions among agents. Our results highlight the need
for aligning risk perceptions among agents or develop new learning techniques
that explicitly account for risk diversity.

black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories of gravity was suggested in
[3]. The parametrization is based on the continued fraction expansion in terms
of the compact radial coordinate and has superior convergence and strict
hierarchy of parameters. It is known that some observable quantities, related
to particle motion around the black hole, such as the eikonal quasinormal
modes, radius of the shadow, frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit,
and others, depend mostly on only a few of the lowest coefficients of the
parametrization. Here we continue this approach by studying the dominant
(low-lying) quasinormal modes for such generally parametrized black holes. We
show that, due to the hierarchy of parameters, the dominant quasinormal
frequencies are also well determined by only the first few coefficients of the
expansion for the so-called moderate black-hole geometries. The latter are
characterized by a relatively slow change of the metric functions in the
radiation zone near the black hole. The nonmoderate metrics, which change
strongly between the event horizon and the innermost stable circular orbit are
usually characterized by echoes or by the distinctive (from the Einstein case)
quasinormal ringing which does not match the current observational data.
Therefore, the compact description of a black-hole spacetime in terms of the
truncated general parametrization is an effective formalism for testing strong
gravity and imposing constraints on allowed black-hole geometries.

joint disease mapping is useful for measuring directional correlation between
them. Most studies study this link through multiple correlated mean
regressions. In this paper we propose a joint quantile regression framework for
multiple diseases where different quantile levels can be considered. We are

deficiency G6PD, where medical scientist have anecdotally discovered a possible

initially pointing towards the occurrence of G6PD inhibiting the occurrence of
Malaria. This link cannot be investigated with mean regressions and thus the
need for flexible joint quantile regression in a disease mapping framework. Our
joint quantile disease mapping model can be used for linear and non-linear
effects of covariates by stochastic splines, since we define it as a latent
Gaussian model. We perform Bayesian inference of this model using the INLA

agent and ""bone"" as patient can be inferred from world knowledge and
plausibility. Quantifying how often this redundancy occurs, and how the level
of redundancy varies across typologically diverse languages, can shed light on
the function and evolution of grammar. To that end, we performed a behavioral
experiment in English and Russian and a cross-linguistic computational analysis
measuring the redundancy of grammatical cues in transitive clauses extracted
from naturalistic text. English and Russian speakers (n=484) were presented
with subjects, verbs, and objects (in random order and with morphological
markings removed) extracted from naturally occurring sentences and were asked
to identify which noun is the agent of the action. Accuracy was high in both

  aged elastomer using phase-field approach",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a physics and chemistry-based constitutive framework to predict
the stress responses of thermo-chemically aged elastomers and capture their
brittle failure using the phase-field approach. High-temperature aging in the
presence of oxygen causes the macromolecular network of elastomers to undergo
complex chemical reactions inducing two main mechanisms: chain-scission and
crosslinking. Chemical crosslinking contributes to the stiffening behavior
characterizing the brittle response of aged elastomers. In this work, we first
modify the Helmholtz free energy to incorporate the effect of
thermo-chemically-driven crosslinking processes. Then, we equip the
constitutive description with phase-field to capture the induced brittle
failure via a strain-based criterion for fracture. We show that our proposed
framework is self-contained and requires only four main material properties
whose evolution due to thermo-chemical aging is characterized entirely by the
change of the crosslink density obtained based on chemical characterization
experiments. The developed constitutive framework is first solved analytically
for the case of uniaxial tension in a homogeneous bar to highlight the
interconnection between all four material properties. Then, the framework is
numerically implemented within a finite element (FE) context via a user-element
subroutine (UEL) in the commercial FE software Abaqus to simulate more
complicated geometries and loading states. The framework is finally validated
with respect to a set of experimental results available in the literature. The
comparison confirms that the proposed constitutive framework can accurately
predict the mechanical response of thermo-chemically aged elastomers. Further
numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effects of evolving material
properties on the response of specimens containing pre-existing cracks.

community-aware centrality measures can be divided into two groups. The first

second group which includes Community-based Mediator and Number of Neighboring
Communities is characterized by more mixed results that vary across networks.

environments to perform well in unseen test environments. Recently, a series of
algorithms such as Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has been proposed for
domain generalization. However, Rosenfeld et al. (2021) shows that in a simple
linear data model, even if non-convexity issues are ignored, IRM and its
extensions cannot generalize to unseen environments with less than $d_s+1$
training environments, where $d_s$ is the dimension of the spurious-feature
subspace. In this paper, we propose to achieve domain generalization with
Invariant-feature Subspace Recovery (ISR). Our first algorithm, ISR-Mean, can
identify the subspace spanned by invariant features from the first-order
moments of the class-conditional distributions, and achieve provable domain
generalization with $d_s+1$ training environments under the data model of
Rosenfeld et al. (2021). Our second algorithm, ISR-Cov, further reduces the
required number of training environments to $O(1)$ using the information of
second-order moments. Notably, unlike IRM, our algorithms bypass non-convexity
issues and enjoy global convergence guarantees. Empirically, our ISRs can
obtain superior performance compared with IRM on synthetic benchmarks. In
addition, on three real-world image and text datasets, we show that both ISRs
can be used as simple yet effective post-processing methods to improve the
worst-case accuracy of (pre-)trained models against spurious correlations and

  Adaptive Designs to Improve Randomized Trial Efficiency",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In clinical trials, there is potential to improve precision and reduce the
required sample size by appropriately adjusting for baseline variables in the
statistical analysis. This is called covariate adjustment. Despite
recommendations by regulatory agencies in favor of covariate adjustment, it
remains underutilized leading to inefficient trials. We address two obstacles
that make it challenging to use covariate adjustment. A first obstacle is the
incompatibility of many covariate adjusted estimators with commonly used
boundaries in group sequential designs (GSDs). A second obstacle is the
uncertainty at the design stage about how much precision gain will result from
covariate adjustment. We propose a method that modifies the original estimator
so that it becomes compatible with GSDs, while increasing or leaving unchanged
the estimator's precision. Our approach allows the use of any asymptotically
linear estimator, which covers many estimators used in randomized trials.
Building on this, we propose using an information adaptive design, that is,
continuing the trial until the required information level is achieved. Such a
design adapts to the amount of precision gain and can lead to faster, more
efficient trials, without sacrificing validity or power. We evaluate estimator
performance in simulations that mimic features of a completed stroke trial.

products, and the impact of political or social movements. The model by
Hegselmann and Krause is a well-known theoretical model to study such opinion
formation processes in social networks. In contrast to many other theoretical
models, it does not converge towards a situation where all agents agree on the
same opinion. Instead, it assumes that people find an opinion reasonable if and
only if it is close to their own. The system converges towards a stable
situation where agents sharing the same opinion form a cluster, and agents in
different clusters do not \mbox{influence each other.}
  We focus on the social variant of the Hegselmann-Krause model where agents
are connected by a social network and their opinions evolve in an iterative
process. When activated, an agent adopts the average of the opinions of its
neighbors having a similar opinion. By this, the set of influencing neighbors
of an agent may change over time. To the best of our knowledge, social
Hegselmann-Krause systems with asynchronous opinion updates have only been
studied with the complete graph as social network. We show that such opinion
dynamics with random agent activation are guaranteed to converge for any social
network. We provide an upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n|E|^2
(\varepsilon/\delta)^2)$ on the expected number of opinion updates until
convergence, where $|E|$ is the number of edges of the social network. For the
complete social network we show a bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^3(n^2 +
(\varepsilon/\delta)^2))$ that represents a major improvement over the
previously best upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n^9 (\varepsilon/\delta)^2)$. Our
bounds are complemented by simulations that indicate asymptotically matching
lower bounds.

The key of this perspective is to decompose the value space, in a state-wise

robust value space is determined by a set of conic hypersurfaces, each of which
contains the robust values of all policies that agree on one state.
Furthermore, we find that taking only extreme points in the uncertainty set is
sufficient to determine the robust value space. Finally, we discuss some other

interest in the possibility of using retrocausality as a route to rejecting the
conclusions of Bell's theorem and restoring locality to quantum physics. On the
other hand, it has also been argued that accepting nonlocality leads to a form
of retrocausality. In this article we seek to elucidate the relationship
between retrocausality and locality. We begin by providing a brief schema of
the various ways in which violations of Bell's inequalities might lead us to
consider some form of retrocausality. We then consider some possible
motivations for using retrocausality to rescue locality, arguing that none of
these motivations is adequate and that therefore there is no clear reason why
we should prefer local retrocausal models to nonlocal retrocausal models. Next,
we examine several different conceptions of retrocausality, concluding that
`all-at-once' retrocausality is more coherent than the alternative dynamical
picture. We then argue that since the `all-at-once' approach requires
probabilities to be assigned to entire histories or mosaics, locality is
somewhat redundant within this picture. Thus we conclude that using
retrocausality as a way to rescue locality may not be the right route to
retrocausality. Finally, we demonstrate that accepting the existence of
nonlocality and insisting on the nonexistence of preferred reference frames
leads naturally to the acceptance of a form of retrocausality, albeit one which
is not mediated by physical systems travelling backwards in time. We argue that
this is the more natural way to motivate retrocausal models of quantum
mechanics.

experimentation brings to firms. For online web-facing firms, however, it still
remains challenging in balancing covariate information when experimental units
arrive sequentially in online field experiments. In this paper, we study a
novel online experimental design problem, which we refer to as the ""Online
Blocking Problem."" In this problem, experimental units with heterogeneous
covariate information arrive sequentially and must be immediately assigned into
either the control or the treatment group, with an objective of minimizing the
total discrepancy, which is defined as the minimum weight perfect matching
between the two groups. To solve this problem, we propose a novel experimental
design approach, which we refer to as the ""Pigeonhole Design."" The pigeonhole
design first partitions the covariate space into smaller spaces, which we refer
to as pigeonholes, and then, when the experimental units arrive at each
pigeonhole, balances the number of control and treatment units for each
pigeonhole. We analyze the theoretical performance of the pigeonhole design and
show its effectiveness by comparing against two well-known benchmark designs:
the match-pair design and the completely randomized design. We conduct
extensive simulations to study the numerical performance of the different
designs and conclude with practical suggestions.

spatial search with multiple marked vertices. The theoretical framework is that
of discrete-time quantum walks (QW), \textit{i.e.} local unitary matrices that
drive the evolution of a single particle on the lattice. QW based search
algorithms are well understood when they have to tackle the fundamental problem
of finding only one marked element in a $d-$dimensional grid and it has been
proven they provide a quadratic advantage over classical searching protocols.
However, once we consider to search more than one element, the behaviour of the
algorithm may be affected by the spatial configuration of the marked elements
and even the quantum advantage is no longer guaranteed. Here our main
contribution is threefold~: (i)~we provide \textit{sufficient conditions for
optimality} for a multi-items QWSearch algorithm~; (ii)~we provide analytical
evidences that \textit{almost, but not all} spatial configurations with
multiple marked elements are optimal; and (iii)~we numerically show that the

low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communications with statistical channel state
information at the user terminals (UTs). The UL massive MIMO LEO satellite
channel model with uniform planar array configurations at the satellite and UTs
is presented. We prove that the rank of each UT's optimal transmit covariance
matrix does not exceed that of its channel correlation matrix at the UT side,
which reveals the maximum number of independent data streams transmitted from
each UT to the satellite. We then prove that the transmit covariance matrix
design can be transformed into the lower-dimensional matrix design without loss
of optimality. We also obtain a necessary and sufficient condition when single
data stream transmission from each UT to the satellite can achieve the ESR
capacity. A conditional gradient (CG) method is developed to compute the ESR
capacity achieving transmit covariance matrices. Furthermore, to avoid the
exhaustive sample average, we utilize an asymptotic expression of the ESR and
devise a simplified CG method to compute the transmit covariance matrices,
which can approximate the ESR capacity. Simulations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

widely used in real-world applications. However, there is a large discrepancy
between the superior practical performance of these approaches and their
theoretical justification. Previous research only indicates a negative
theoretical result: Thompson sampling could have a worst-case linear regret
$\Omega(T)$ with a constant threshold on the inference error measured by one
$\alpha$-divergence. To bridge this gap, we propose an Enhanced Bayesian Upper
Confidence Bound (EBUCB) framework that can efficiently accommodate bandit
problems in the presence of approximate inference. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that for Bernoulli multi-armed bandits, EBUCB can achieve the
optimal regret order $O(\log T)$ if the inference error measured by two
different $\alpha$-divergences is less than a constant, regardless of how large
this constant is. Our study provides the first theoretical regret bound that is
better than $o(T)$ in the setting of constant approximate inference error, to
our best knowledge. Furthermore, in concordance with the negative results in
previous studies, we show that only one bounded $\alpha$-divergence is
insufficient to guarantee a sub-linear regret.

quasi-local energy together with an additional term arising due to the coupling
of gravity to a gauge field constitutes the total energy ($\mathcal{QLE}$)
contained within the membrane $\Sigma=\partial\Omega$. We specialize in the
Kerr-Newman family of spacetimes which contains a U(1) gauge field coupled to
gravity and an outer horizon. Through explicit calculations, we show that the
total energy satisfies a weaker version of a Bekenstein type inequality
$\mathcal{QLE}> \frac{Q^{2}}{2R}$ for large spherical membranes, $Q$ is the
charge and $R$ is the radius of the membrane. Turning off the angular momentum

constant radii membranes containing the horizon and in such case the charge
factor appearing in the right-hand side exactly equals to that of Bekenstein's

are homotheties. Using this we show that a conformal transformation of a
conformally curved Cahen-Wallach space is essential if and only if it has a
fixed point. Then we explore the possibility of properly discontinuous groups
of conformal transformations acting with a compact orbit space on a conformally
curved Cahen-Wallach space. We show that any such group cannot centralise an
essential homothety and that for Cahen-Wallach spaces of imaginary type must be
contained within the isometries.

alfaE and ac magnetic susceptibility of the MnSi/PMN-PT composite. We found
that the regular skyrmion lattice phase in single crystal sample has been
averaged in the MnSi polycrystal due to random grain orientations which results
in an extended skyrmion lattice-conical mixture phase down to 25 K. The
magnitude of the out-of-phase component in alfaE of the polycrystal, not single
crystal, decreases gradually with decreasing frequency. With the changing of
the driven ac field, it reveals a depinning threshold behavior in both samples.
The depinning field is stronger in the polycrystal than that in single crystal
and maybe responsible for the diminishing of dissipative behavior at lower
frequency due to grain boundaries and defects. The composite magnetoelectric
method provides a unique approach to probe topological phase dynamics.

Macroscopically, its oxidation degree, oxygen content and amorphous structures
exhibit a gradient decline from its surface to its bottom. Beneath a stable
chemisorbed oxygen-metal atom monolayer, residue Ti lattice structures resemble
stones and amorphous structures composed of TiO2, Ti2O3 and TiO resemble
mortar, together they forming a heterogeneous stone-wall like structure. The
rapid formation of the stable chemisorbed monolayer passivates the outmost Ti
atoms to start Ti passivation, and subsequently a dissipative mechanism of
oxidation cracks the Ti lattice structures and thus the oxide layer is formed
and effect passivation. The solid phase formed by the open, stable,
macroscopically-ordered, non-equilibrium oxide film, which can be aptly called
""the dissipative oxidation phase"", theoretically does not end in complete
oxidation of thermodynamic stability. This study derails both the adsorption

spin carriers in materials under an external electric field and has been
observed in semiconductors, metals, and insulators at or below room

induced by the baryon chemical potential gradient which plays the role of the
analogous electric field and which becomes sizable in the fireballs created in
heavy-ion collisions at beam energy of ${\cal O}(10)$~GeV. In this letter, we
study this important mechanism for spin polarization generation that has not
been systematically explored before and predict the signature of the SHE in
those collisions using a (3+1)~D viscous hydrodynamic model MUSIC with AMPT
initial condition. We propose to use the second Fourier coefficients of the net
spin polarization of Lambda hyperon as sensitive probes to search for the SHE.
Those SHE observables show a qualitative difference in both the sign and beam

systems with random parameters, where the number of solution evaluations is

decomposition based on polynomial chaos expansions. For the class of systems we
consider (i.e., high dimensional with limited solution evaluations) the
coefficients are given by an underdetermined linear system in a regression
formulation. This implies additional assumptions, such as sparsity of the
coefficient vector, are needed to approximate the solution. Here, we present an
approach where we assume the coefficients are close to the range of a
generative model that maps from a low to a high dimensional space of
coefficients. Our approach is inspired be recent work examining how generative
models can be used for compressed sensing in systems with random Gaussian
measurement matrices. Using results from PDE theory on coefficient decay rates,
we construct an explicit generative model that predicts the polynomial chaos
coefficient magnitudes. The algorithm we developed to find the coefficients,
which we call GenMod, is composed of two main steps. First, we predict the
coefficient signs using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Then, we assume the
coefficients are within a sparse deviation from the range of a sign-adjusted
generative model. This allows us to find the coefficients by solving a
nonconvex optimization problem, over the input space of the generative model
and the space of sparse vectors. We obtain theoretical recovery results for a
Lipschitz continuous generative model and for a more specific generative model,
based on coefficient decay rate bounds. We examine three high-dimensional
problems and show that, for all three examples, the generative model approach
outperforms sparsity promoting methods at small sample sizes.

more groups in each round. It is also incorporated with a novel Inter-Cluster

results suggest a magnetically heterogeneous ground state with weakly
interacting ferromagnetic clusters coexisting with a non-ferromagnetic phase.
The length of the sample expands in the direction of the applied magnetic field
(positive magnetostriction) and does not show saturation even at 50 kOe. The
magnetostriction has a maximum value (= 252 ppm) at 10 K and it decreases with
increasing temperature. The smaller value of magnetostriction compared to the
available data on La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 suggests that non-ferromagnetic matrix is most
likely antiferromagnetic and it restrains the field-induced expansion of
ferromagnetic clusters in the microwave synthesized La0.5Ba0.5CoO3-d sample.

reduced to a Voronoi corridor to further improve the search efficiency, along
with a Voronoi potential field constructed to make the searched path keep a
reasonable distance from obstacles to provide sufficient optimization margin
for the subsequent path smoothing, and 2) an efficient quadratic
programming-based path smoothing approach is presented, wherein the clearance
to obstacles is considered in the form of the penalty of the deviation from the
safe reference path to improve the path clearance of hard-constrained path
smoothing approaches. We validate the efficiency and smoothness of our approach
in various challenging simulation scenarios and large-scale outdoor

17.1% in the path searching stage, and smoothing the path with our approach is
11.86 times faster than a recent gradient-based path smoothing approach. We
will release the source code to the robotics community.

systems with easily and fully tunable spin-orbit torques. Here, current-induced
spin-orbit torques in VO$_2$/NiFe heterostructures were investigated using
spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance, where the VO$_2$ layer undergoes a
prominent insulator-metal transition. A roughly two-fold increase in the
Gilbert damping parameter, $\alpha$, with temperature was attributed to the
change in the VO$_2$/NiFe interface spin absorption across the VO$_2$ phase
transition. More remarkably, a large modulation ($\pm$100%) and a sign change
of the current-induced spin-orbit torque across the VO$_2$ phase transition
suggest two competing spin-orbit torque generating mechanisms. The bulk spin
Hall effect in metallic VO$_2$, corroborated by our first-principles
calculation of spin Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{SH} \approx 10^4
\frac{\hbar}{e} \Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$, is verified as the main source of the
spin-orbit torque in the metallic phase. The self-induced/anomalous torque in
NiFe, of the opposite sign and a similar magnitude to the bulk spin Hall effect
in metallic VO$_2$, could be the other competing mechanism that dominates as
temperature decreases. For applications, the strong tunability of the torque
strength and direction opens a new route to tailor spin-orbit torques of
materials which undergo phase transitions for new device functionalities.

depend on learning models to collect insights from graph-structured data.
Previous works mostly focused on using post-hoc approaches to interpret
pre-trained models (graph neural networks in particular). They argue against
inherently interpretable models because the good interpretability of these
models is often at the cost of their prediction accuracy. However, those
post-hoc methods often fail to provide stable interpretation and may extract
features that are spuriously correlated with the task. In this work, we address
these issues by proposing Graph Stochastic Attention (GSAT). Derived from the
information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity to the attention
weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components while
learning stochasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs for
interpretation. The selected subgraphs provably do not contain patterns that
are spuriously correlated with the task under some assumptions. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets show that GSAT outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods by up to 20%$\uparrow$ in interpretation AUC and 5%$\uparrow$ in
prediction accuracy. Our code is available at

ionospheric measurements at the site where the SKA-Low will be built, using MWA
Phase-2 Extended baseline observations and the station-based Low-frequency
Excision of Atmosphere in Parallel (LEAP) calibration algorithm. We have done
this via direct regression analysis of the ionospheric screens and by forming
the full and detrended structure functions. We found that 50% of the screens
show significant non-linear structures at scales >0.6km that dominate at >2km,
and 1% show significant sub-minute temporal changes, providing that there is
sufficient sensitivity. Even at the moderate sensitivity and baseline lengths
of MWA, non-linear corrections are required at 88 MHz during moderate-weather

predict that improvements will come from correcting for higher-order defocusing

This paper proposes a novel algorithm that encodes the partial derivatives
themselves and furthermore optimizes the codes by performing lossy compression
on the derivative codewords by maximizing the information contained in the
codewords while minimizing the information between the codewords. The utility
of this application of coding theory is a geometrical consequence of the
observed fact in optimization research that noise is tolerable, sometimes even
helpful, in gradient descent based learning algorithms since it helps avoid
overfitting and local minima. This stands in contrast with much current
conventional work on distributed coded computation which focuses on recovering
all of the data from the workers. A second further contribution is that the
low-weight nature of the coding scheme allows for asynchronous gradient updates
since the code can be iteratively decoded; i.e., a worker's task can
immediately be updated into the larger gradient. The directional derivative is
always a linear function of the direction vectors; thus, our framework is
robust since it can apply linear coding techniques to general machine learning
frameworks such as deep neural networks.

linear system is not necessarily to be symmetric and square, so the discretized
problem is solved by a least-square method. Take the Poisson problem as an
example, mixed DPGMs based on several mixed formulations are proposed and
studied as well. In addition, we apply the DPGM to solve two classical

irreversible logic, including those developed by industry in semiconductor
circuits, however, more research is needed to understand what is possible.
Superconducting logic, an exemplary platform for both irreversible and
reversible logic, uses flux quanta to represent bits, and the reversible
implementation may switch state with low energy dissipation relative to the
energy of a flux quantum. Here we simulate reversible shift register gates that
are ballistic: their operation is powered by the input bits alone. A storage
loop is added relative to previous gates as a key innovation, which bestows an
asynchronous property to the gate such that input bits can arrive at different
times as long as their order is clearly preserved. The shift register
represents bit states by flux polarity, both in the stored bit as well as the
ballistic input and output bits. Its operation consists of the elastic swapping
of flux between the stored and the moving bit. This is related to a famous
irreversible shift register, developed prior to the advent of superconducting
flux quanta logic (which used irreversible gates). In the base design of our
ballistic shift register (BSR) there is one 1-input and 1-output port, but we
find that we can make other asynchronous ballistic gates by extension. The gate
constitutes the first asynchronous reversible 2-input gate. Finally, for a
better insight into the dynamics, we introduce a collective coordinate model.
We find that the gate can be described as motion in two coordinates subject to
a potential determined by the input bit and initial stored flux quantum. Aside
from the favorable asynchronous feature, the gate is considered practical in
the context of energy efficiency, parameter margins, logical depth, and speed.

study of artificial and natural intelligence. In our view, both camps have
complementary values. So, we sought to synergistically combine them. Here, we
propose a methodology to convert deep discriminative networks to kernel
generative networks. We leveraged the fact that deep models, including both
random forests and deep networks, learn internal representations which are
unions of polytopes with affine activation functions to conceptualize them both
as generalized partitioning rules. We replace the affine function in each
polytope populated by the training data with Gaussian kernel that results in a
generative model. Theoretically, we derive the conditions under which our
generative models are a consistent estimator of the corresponding class
conditional density. Moreover, our proposed models obtain well calibrated
posteriors for in-distribution, and extrapolate beyond the training data to
handle out-of-distribution inputs reasonably. We believe this approach may be
an important step in unifying the thinking and the approaches across the
discriminative and the generative divide.

  Intra-Query Parallelism",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) has recently drawn a rapid increase of interest
due to its core role in managing high-dimensional vector data in data science
and AI applications. The interest is fueled by the success of neural embedding,
where deep learning models transform unstructured data into semantically
correlated feature vectors for data analysis, e.g., recommend popular items.
Among several categories of methods for fast NNS, similarity graph is one of
the most successful algorithmic trends. Several of the most popular and
top-performing similarity graphs, such as NSG and HNSW, at their core employ
best-first traversal along the underlying graph indices to search near
neighbors. Maximizing the performance of the search is essential for many
tasks, especially at the large-scale and high-recall regime. In this work, we
provide an in-depth examination of the challenges of the state-of-the-art
similarity search algorithms, revealing its challenges in leveraging multi-core
processors to speed up the search efficiency. We also exploit whether
similarity graph search is robust to deviation from maintaining strict order by
allowing multiple walkers to simultaneously advance the search frontier. Based
on our insights, we propose Speed-ANN, a parallel similarity search algorithm
that exploits hidden intra-query parallelism and memory hierarchy that allows
similarity search to take advantage of multiple CPU cores to significantly
accelerate search speed while achieving high accuracy.
  We evaluate Speed-ANN on a wide range of datasets, ranging from million to
billion data points, and show its shorter query latency than NSG and HNSW,
respectively. Besides, with multicore support, we show that our approach offers
faster search latency than highly-optimized GPU implementation and provides
good scalability as the increase of the number of hardware resources (e.g., CPU
cores) and graph sizes.

However, the implicit functions learned by neural networks usually include

Removing artifacts while preserving fine-scale contents is challenging and
usually comes out with over-smoothing or noisy issues. To solve this dilemma,
we propose a new framework (FINN) that integrates a filtering module into the
MLPs to perform data reconstruction while adapting regions containing different
frequencies. The filtering module has a smoothing operator acting on
intermediate results of the network that encourages the results to be smooth
and a recovering operator bringing high frequencies to regions overly smooth.
The two counteractive operators play consecutively in all MLP layers to
adaptively influence the reconstruction. We demonstrate the advantage of FINN

instruments are producing vast volumes of data across a wide range of domains,
which introduces a serious burden on data transfer and storage. Error-bounded
lossy compression has been developed and widely used in scientific community,
because not only can it significantly reduce the data volumes but it can also
strictly control the data distortion based on the use-specified error bound.
Existing lossy compressors, however, cannot offer ultra-fast compression speed,
which is highly demanded by quite a few applications or use-cases (such as
in-memory compression and online instrument data compression). In this paper,
we propose a novel ultra-fast error-bounded lossy compressor, which can obtain
fairly high compression performance on both CPU and GPU, also with reasonably
high compression ratios. The key contributions are three-fold: (1) We propose a
novel, generic ultra-fast error-bounded lossy compression framework -- called
UFZ, by confining our design to be composed of only super-lightweight
operations such as bitwise and addition/subtraction operation, still keeping a
certain high compression ratio. (2) We implement UFZ on both CPU and GPU and
optimize the performance according to their architectures carefully. (3) We
perform a comprehensive evaluation with 6 real-world production-level
scientific datasets on both CPU and GPU. Experiments show that UFZ is 2~16X as
fast as the second-fastest existing error-bounded lossy compressor (either SZ
or ZFP) on CPU and GPU, with respect to both compression and decompression.

quench in the temperature T (coarsening). There are 2 transitions in the model,
I->Nm at Tc1 & Nm->Sm at Tc2<Tc1. K' decreases Tc1 significantly, but has
relatively little effect on Tc2. Domain growth in Nm phase exhibits the
well-known LAC law, L(t)~t^0.5 & evolution is via annihilation of string
defects. The system exhibits dynamical scaling that is also robust with respect
to K'. We find that Sm phase at quench temperatures T (T>Tc1->T<Tc2) that we
consider has SmB order with a hexatic arrangement of the LC molecules in the
layers. Coarsening in this phase exhibits a striking two-time-scale scenario:
first the LC molecules align & develop orientational order, followed by
emergence of characteristic layering along with the hexatic
bond-orientational-order within layers. Consequently, the growth follows the
LAC law L(t)~t^0.5 at early times & then shows a sharp crossover to a slower
growth regime at later times. Our observations strongly suggest L(t)~t^0.25 in
this regime. Interestingly, the correlation function shows dynamical scaling in
both the regimes & the scaling function is universal. The dynamics is also
robust with respect to changes in K', but the smecticity is more pronounced at
larger values. Further, the early-time dynamics is governed by string defects,
while the late-time evolution is dictated by interfacial defects. We believe
this scenario is generic to Sm phase even with other kinds of local order

obstacles in the environment, the UAVs must ensure that there is no collision
between the payload and these obstacles while ensuring that the payload
oscillations are kept minimum. An Integrated Decision Controller (IDC) is
proposed, that integrates the optimal tracking control law given by a
centralized Model Predictive Controller with safety-critical constraints
provided by the Exponential Control Barrier Functions. The entire payload-UAV
system is enclosed by a safe convex hull boundary, and the IDC ensures that no

SEFD expression against the often-used root-mean-square (RMS) SEFD
approximation, SEFDrmsI = (1/2)(SEFD^2_XX + SEFD^2_YY)^(1/2) to study the
inaccuracy of the SEFDrms.
  We take into account all mutual coupling and noise coupling within an array
environment (intra-array coupling). This intra-array noise coupling is included
in the SEFD expression through the realized noise resistance of the array,
which accounts for the system noise. No assumption is made regarding the
polarization (or lack thereof) of the sky nor the orthogonality of the antenna
elements. The fundamental noise assumption is that, in phasor representation,
the real and imaginary components of a given noise source are independent and
equally distributed (iid) with zero mean. Noise sources that are mutually
correlated and non-iid among themselves are allowed, provided the real and
imaginary components of each noise source are iid. The system noise is
uncorrelated between array entities separated by a baseline distance, which in
the case of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is typically tens of
wavelengths or greater. By comparing the resulting SEFD formula to the
SEFD_I^rms approximation, we proved that SEFD_I^rms always underestimates the
SEFD, which leads to an overestimation of array sensitivity.

elemental abundances were investigated. When a magnetic field reconnects, its
energy is converted to the kinetic energy of charged particles, as observed for
solar energetic particles arriving on earth. This accelerates the cosmic
background nuclei, and energetic nuclei induce nonthermal reactions. A
constraint on the dissipation is derived from a theoretical calculation of the
nonthermal reactions during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We found that
observations of the Li and D abundances can be explained if 0.01--0.1 % of the
cosmic energy density was utilized for nuclear acceleration after the
electron--positron annihilation epoch. Reconnections of such amplitudes of
magnetic fields generate outgoing jets, the bulk velocity of which evolves to
values appropriate for cosmic ray (CR) nuclear energies of 0.1--1 MeV necessary
for successful CR nucleosynthesis. Therefore, acceleration of cosmic background
nuclei during the dissipation of primordial magnetic fields is a possible
generation mechanism of soft CRs that has been suggested as a solution to the
cosmic Li problem. Among the solutions suggested without exotic physics, only
the dissipating magnetic field model suggested here explains observations of
both low Li and high D abundances. Our results demonstrate that signatures of
strong magnetic fields in the early universe have been observed in primordial
elemental abundances.

water equation with
  a non-flat bottom topography. The major novelty of our work is the use of
velocity field as an independent solution unknown in the DG scheme, which is
closely related to the entropy variable approach to entropy stable schemes for
system of conservation laws proposed by Tadmor [22] back in 1986, where recall
that velocity is part of the entropy variable for the shallow water equations.
Due to the use of velocity as an independent solution unknown, no specific
numerical quadrature rules are needed to achieve entropy stability of our
scheme on general unstructured meshes in two dimensions.
  The proposed DG semi-discretization is then carefully combined with the
classical explicit strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK) time
integrators [13] to yield a locally conservative, well-balanced, and positivity
preserving fully discrete scheme. Here the positivity preservation property is
enforced with the help of a simple scaling limiter. In the fully discrete
scheme, we re-introduce discharge as an auxiliary unknown variable. In doing
so, standard slope limiting procedures can be applied on the conservative
variables (water height and discharge) without violating the local conservation
property. Here we apply a characteristic-wise TVB limiter [5] on the
conservative variables using the Fu-Shu troubled cell indicator [10] in each
inner stage of the Runge-Kutta time stepping to suppress numerical
oscillations.

translate and rotate matter without contact. However, the existing research
mainly focused on manipulating simple symmetrical geometries, neglecting the
significance of geometric features. For the non-spherical geometries, the shape
of the object strongly affects its scattering properties, and thus the
radiation force and torque as well as the acoustophoretic process. Here, we
develop a semi-analytical framework to calculate the radiation force and torque
exerted on the axisymmetric particles excited by a user-customized transducer
array based on a conformal transformation approach, capturing the significance
of the geometric features. The derivation framework is established under the
computation coordinate system (CCS), whereas the particle is assumed to be
static. For the dynamic processes, the rotation of particle is converted as the
opposite rotation of transducer array, achieved by employing a rotation
transformation to tune the incident driving field in the CCS. Later, the
obtained radiation force and torque in the CCS should be transformed back to
the observation coordinate system (OCS) for force and torque analysis. The
radiation force and torque exerted on particles with different orientations are
validated by comparing the full three-dimensional numerical solution in
different phase distributions. It is found that the proposed method presents
superior computational accuracy, high geometric adaptivity, and good robustness
to various geometric features, while the computational efficiency is more than
100 times higher than that of the full numerical method. Furthermore, it is
found that the dynamic trajectories of particles with different geometric
features are completely different, indicating that the geometric features can
be a potential degree of freedom to tune acoustophoretic process.

to reduce the intensity gradient and analyse the structures and processes
occurring at different heights in the solar corona within the full field of

(SiRGraF). This algorithm is based on subtracting a minimum background

by a uniform intensity gradient image to enhance the K-corona. We demonstrate
the utility of this algorithm to bring out the short time-scale transient

We have successfully tested the algorithm on images of the LASCO-C2 onboard the

good signal to noise ratio (SNR) along with low-SNR images of STEREO/COR-1A and

For capillary filled pores (75% relative humidity, RH), the OH-stretching

part of the pore. It adopts a bulk-like structure that is modestly disrupted by
confinement and surface hydrophobicity. For partially filled pores (33% RH),
the structure of the non-freezable adsorbed film radically differs from that

the Raman spectral fingerprint of low density amorphous ice, even at low

optically excited semiconductors as the electronic analogue of a hydrogen atom.
In the two-dimensional (2D) case, realized either in quantum well systems or
truly 2D materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides, the relative
motion of an exciton is described by two quantum numbers: the principal quantum
number $n$, and a quantum number $j$ for the angular momentum along the
perpendicular axis. Conservation of angular momentum demands that only the
$j=0$ states of the excitons are optically active in a system illuminated by
plane waves. Here we consider the case for spatially structured light sources,
specifically for twisted light beams with non-zero orbital angular momentum per
photon. Under the so-called dipole approximation where the spatial variations
of the light source occur on length scales much larger than the size of the
semiconductor's unit cell, we show that the photon (linear and/or angular)
momentum is coupled to the center-of-mass (linear and/or angular) momentum of
the exciton. Our study establishes that the selection rule for the internal

One critical task is the disentanglement of the intrinsic garment shape from
deformations due to fabric properties, physical forces, and contact with the
body. We propose to use a garment sewing pattern, a realistic and compact
garment descriptor, to facilitate the intrinsic garment shape estimation.
Another major challenge is a high diversity of shapes and designs in the
domain. The most common approach for Deep Learning on 3D garments is to build
specialized models for individual garments or garment types. We argue that
building a unified model for various garment designs has the benefit of
generalization to novel garment types, hence covering a larger design domain
than individual models would. We introduce NeuralTailor, a novel architecture
based on point-level attention for set regression with variable cardinality,
and apply it to the task of reconstructing 2D garment sewing patterns from the
3D point could garment models. Our experiments show that NeuralTailor
successfully reconstructs sewing patterns and generalizes to garment types with

between them, as learned by knowledge graph representation models, is useful
for various tasks, including predicting new facts, question answering, fact
checking and information retrieval. The focus of this thesis is on (i)
improving knowledge graph representation with the aim of tackling the link
prediction task; and (ii) devising a theory on how semantics can be captured in
the geometry of relation representations. Most knowledge graphs are very
incomplete and manually adding new information is costly, which drives the
development of methods which can automatically infer missing facts. The first
contribution of this thesis is HypER, a convolutional model which simplifies
and improves upon the link prediction performance of the existing convolutional
state-of-the-art model ConvE and can be mathematically explained in terms of
constrained tensor factorisation. The second contribution is TuckER, a
relatively straightforward linear model, which, at the time of its
introduction, obtained state-of-the-art link prediction performance across
standard datasets. The third contribution is MuRP, first multi-relational graph
representation model embedded in hyperbolic space. MuRP outperforms all
existing models and its Euclidean counterpart MuRE in link prediction on
hierarchical knowledge graph relations whilst requiring far fewer dimensions.
Despite the development of a large number of knowledge graph representation
models with gradually increasing predictive performance, relatively little is
known of the latent structure they learn. We generalise recent theoretical
understanding of how semantic relations of similarity, paraphrase and analogy
are encoded in the geometric interactions of word embeddings to how more
general relations, as found in knowledge graphs, can be encoded in their
representations.

serious concern for operators, who pursue the integrity of their assets, the
reduction of losses and the prevention of environmental hazards. Whenever a
hole occurs in a pressurized pipeline, the corresponding fluid leakage is
characterized by a turbulent flow and a peculiar acoustic noise, whose
characteristics depend also on the size of the hole itself. This study shows
that both the presence and the size of such a leaking hole can be successfully
detected, by exploiting the acoustic noise (pressure transients) generated by
the fluid exiting the pipe and recorded internally by hydrophones, or by
considering the corresponding vibrations (e.g., acceleration signals)
propagating along the external shell of the conduit. To this purpose, several
experimental campaigns of acoustic noise generation have been performed using
multiple calibrated nozzles on a 16 ID connection pipeline in a fuel tanks
area. Detection and classification procedures are proposed to control the
presence of leakages and to estimate the size of the hole, using pressure and
vibration signals.

function of any $(3+1)$-free poset is $e$-positive. Guay-Paquet reduced the
conjecture to $(3+1)$- and $(2+2)$-free posets which are also called natural
unit interval orders. Shareshian and Wachs defined chromatic quasisymmetric
functions, generalizing chromatic symmetric functions, and conjectured that a
chromatic quasisymmetric function of any natural unit interval order is
$e$-positive and $e$-unimodal.
  For a given natural interval order, there is a corresponding partition
$\lambda$ and we denote the chromatic quasisymmetric function by $X_\lambda$.
The first author introduced local linear relations for chromatic quasisymmetric
functions. In this paper, we prove a powerful generalization of the
above-mentioned local linear relations, called a rectangular lemma, which also
generalizes the result of Huh,Nam and Yoo. Such a lemma can be applied to
describe explicit formulas for $e$-positivity of a chromatic symmetric function
$X_\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is contained in a rectangle. We also suggest some
conjectural formulas for $e$-positivity when $\lambda$ is not contained in a
rectangle by applying the rectangular lemma.

challenging task. MRIs are typically read and interpreted by domain experts,
which is a tedious and time-consuming process. Recently, unsupervised anomaly
detection (UAD) in brain MRI with deep learning has shown promising results to
provide a quick, initial assessment. So far, these methods only rely on the
visual appearance of healthy brain anatomy for anomaly detection. Another
biomarker for abnormal brain development is the deviation between the brain age
and the chronological age, which is unexplored in combination with UAD. We
propose deep learning for UAD in 3D brain MRI considering additional age
information. We analyze the value of age information during training, as an
additional anomaly score, and systematically study several architecture
concepts. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel deep learning approach for
UAD with multi-task age prediction. We use clinical T1-weighted MRIs of 1735
healthy subjects and the publicly available BraTs 2019 data set for our study.
Our novel approach significantly improves UAD performance with an AUC of 92.60%
compared to an AUC-score of 84.37% using previous approaches without age

heating-induced hardening (CISHIH) dual anomaly was predicted in group VB

phenomenon is reported. By using accurate high-temperature high-pressure sound
velocities measured at Hugoniot states generated by shock-waves, together with
first-principles calculations, we observe not only the prominent

softening in shear modulus by compression, whereas the latter reflects the
reverse hardening by heat. These experiments also unveil another anomaly in
Young's modulus that wasn't reported before. Based on the experimental and
theoretical data, we infer that vanadium might transition from BCC into two
different rhombohedral (RH1 and RH2) phases at about 79GPa and 116GPa along the

promotes condensation, is studied using the pruned and enriched Rosenbluth
method on a simple cubic lattice. For slightly poor solvent, melting
temperature decreases linearly with a change in the solvent quality, which
later changes slope and starts increasing as the melting line approaches the
tricritical collapse curve. First-order melting transition, as in good solvent,
gives way to continuous transition, and then to further broadened transitions
where the order parameter smoothly becomes zero, for sufficiently poor solvent.
This change in the melting behavior is accompanied by a continuously varying
critical exponent along the second-order transition line, hinting at a
non-universal nature of the melting transition. Further, we show that an
unbound phase can be achieved just by changing the solvent quality.
Importantly, our results conform to the experimental findings qualitatively.

reactions. The first set of these reactions, which happen near a gene promoter,
are considered to be the most important in the context of stochastic noise. The
most common models of transcription are primarily concerned with the effect of
activators/repressors on the overall transcription rate and approximate the
basal transcription processes as a one step event. According to such effective
models, the Fano factor of mRNA copy distributions is always greater than
(super-Poissonian) or equal to 1 (Poissonian), and the only way to go below
this limit (sub-Poissonian) is via a negative feedback. It is partly due to
this limit that the first stage of transcription is held responsible for most
of the stochastic noise in mRNA copy numbers. However, by considering all major
reactions that build and drive the basal transcription machinery, from the
first protein that binds a promoter to the entrance of the transcription
complex (TC) into productive elongation, it is shown that the first two stages
of transcription, namely the pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation and the
promoter proximal pausing (PPP), is a highly punctual process. In other words,
the time between the first and the last step of this process is narrowly
distributed, which gives rise to sub-Poissonian distributions for the number of
TCs that have entered productive elongation. In fact, having simulated the PIC
formation and the PPP via the Gillespie algorithm using 2000 distinct parameter
sets and 4 different reaction network topologies, it is shown that only 4.4%
give rise to a Fano factor that is > 1 with the upper bound of 1.7, while for
31% of cases the Fano factor is below 0.5, with 0.19 as the lower bound. These
results cast doubt on the notion that most of the stochastic noise observed in
mRNA distributions always originates at the promoter.

discovering the origin of the observed binary black hole mergers. Towards this
end, identifying features in the growing wealth of data may help in
distinguishing different formation pathways. While large uncertainties still
affect the binary formation models, spin-mass relations remain characteristic
features of specific classes of channels. By focusing on the effective inspiral
spin $\chi_\text{eff}$, the best reconstructed spin-related merger parameter,
we show that current GWTC-3 data support the hypothesis that a fraction of
events may display mass-spin correlations similar to one expected by dynamical
formation channels of either astrophysical or primordial nature. We quantify
the Bayesian evidence in favour of those models, which are substantially
preferred when compared to the Gaussian phenomenological model adopted to
describe the distribution of $\chi_\text{eff}$ in the recent LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA

show that the coherent transmission through the $3d$ states is greatly
suppressed by electron correlations. This is mainly due to the finite lifetime
induced by the electron-electron interaction and is directly related to the
imaginary part of the computed many-body DMFT self-energy. At the Fermi energy,
where in accordance with the Fermi-liquid behavior the imaginary part of the
self-energy vanishes, the suppression of the transmission is entirely due to
the shifts of the energy spectrum induced by electron correlations. Based our

  Communications, title changed",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Arguably our current cosmological paradigm, the so-called $\Lambda$CDM
`concordance model', faces an existential crisis. This has largely been brought
about by its reliance on the twin concepts of dark matter and dark energy, and
the continued inability of the observational and theoretical physics community
to find viable candidates for these postulated phenomena. While it is still
possible that this search will eventually prove successful, it is perhaps
worthwhile looking at alternatives, and in particular, re-examining the very
foundations of our current cosmological model to see whether an entirely new
cosmological paradigm might provide a better explanation.
  The main failures of the prevailing cosmological paradigm were reviewed,
concentrating on the coincidences and contradictions presented by the
relationship between dark matter and dark energy. Revisiting the core features
of this paradigm, the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric is
identified as the likely root cause of current issues with the $\Lambda$CDM
model. Building on the concept of a `timeless' universe suggested by a number
of theorists in recent years, the exochronous metric is introduced and is shown
to give rise to a static solution to the Einstein field equations. The
cosmological implications of this model are explored, and we demonstrate that
it can result in a universe with a critical energy density that is close to the
currently observed baryonic matter density, without the need to invoke dark
matter or dark energy.

a given mean ball density. We compute several quantities exactly in such
homogeneous stationary state: the mean value and the variance of the number of
balls $N_t$ crossing the origin during time $t$, and the scaled cumulants
generating function associated to $N_t$. We also compute two spatially
integrated current-current correlations. The first one, involving the long-time
limit of the current-current correlations, is the so-called Drude weight and is
obtained with thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). The second one, involving equal
time current-current correlations is calculated using a transfer matrix
approach. A family of generalized currents, associated to the conserved charges

long-time limits of their correlations generalize the Drude weight and the
second cumulant of $N_t$ and are found to obey nontrivial symmetry relations.
They are computed using TBA and the results are found to be in good agreement

explicitly the whole family of flux Jacobian matrices. Finally, some of these
results are extended to a (non-i.i.d.) two-temperatures generalized Gibbs state

schemes, and use this result to derive a unified form of the IPMs and a relaxed

unconstrained maximum likelihood estimator to perform DRE with a stratified
sampling scheme. We further propose a novel class of probability divergences,

applied in nuclear physics and some other areas of physics. This study begins
with the calculations of {\alpha}-decay half-lives for some neutron-deficient
nuclei using Coulomb and proximity potential model (CPPM), temperature
dependent Coulomb and proximity potential model (CPPMT), Royer empirical
formula, new Ren B (NRB) formula, and a trained artificial neural network model
(TANN ). By comparison with experimental values, the ANN model is found to give
very good descriptions of the half-lives of the neutron-deficient nuclei.
Moreover CPPMT is found to perform better than CPPM, indicating the importance
of employing temperature-dependent nuclear potential. Furthermore, to predict
the {\alpha}-decay half-lives of unmeasured neutron-deficient nuclei, another
ANN algorithm is trained to predict the Q {\alpha} values. The results of the Q
{\alpha} predictions are compared with the Weizs\""acker-Skyrme-4+RBF (WS4+RBF)
formula. The half-lives of unmeasured neutron-deficient nuclei are then
predicted using CPPM, CPPMT, Royer, NRB, and TANN , with Q{\alpha} values
predicted by ANN as inputs. This study concludes that half-lives of
{\alpha}-decay from neutron-deficient nuclei can successfully be predicted
using ANN, and this can contribute to the determination of nuclei at the

or, in a more abstract way, when systems further from equilibrium relax faster.
In this paper, we investigate the Mpemba effect in a molecular gas with
nonlinear drag, both analytically (by employing the tools of kinetic theory)
and numerically (direct simulation Monte Carlo of the kinetic equation and
event-driven molecular dynamics). The analysis is carried out via two
alternative routes, recently considered in the literature: first, the kinetic
or thermal route, in which the Mpemba effect is characterized by the crossing
of the evolution curves of the kinetic temperature (average kinetic energy),
and, second, the stochastic thermodynamics or entropic route, in which the
Mpemba effect is characterized by the crossing of the distance to equilibrium
in probability space. In general, a nonmutual correspondence between the
thermal and entropic Mpemba effects is found, i.e., there may appear the
thermal effect without its entropic counterpart or vice versa. Furthermore, a
nontrivial overshoot with respect to equilibrium of the thermal relaxation
makes it necessary to revise the usual definition of the thermal Mpemba effect,
which is shown to be better described in terms of the relaxation of the local
equilibrium distribution. Our theoretical framework, which involves an extended
Sonine approximation in which not only the excess kurtosis but also the sixth
cumulant is retained, gives an excellent account of the behavior observed in

observed in a wide range of applications in biological, environmental and

transport mechanisms of the fluids at the interface between the layered
constituents. Of special interest is the water transport in polymer electrolyte
membrane fuel cells (PEM FC). Here, it is necessary to understand the transport
mechanisms of water throughout the cell constituents especially on the cathode
side, where the excess water has to be removed. This is crucial to choose
optimal operating conditions and improve the overall cell performance.
Pore-scale modeling of gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and gas distributor has been
established as a favorable technique to investigate the ongoing processes.
Investigating the interface between the hydrophobic porous GDL and the
hydrophilic gas distributor, a particular challenge is the combination and
interaction of the different material structures and wetting properties at the
interface and its influence on the flow. In this paper, a modeling approach is
presented which captures the influence of a hydrophilic domain on the flow in a
hydrophobic porous domain at the interface between the two domains. A
pore-network model is used as the basis of the developed concept which is
extended to allow the modeling of mixed-wet interactions at the interface. The
functionality of the model is demonstrated using basic example configurations
with one and several interface pores and it is applied to a realistic GDL
representation in contact with a channel-land structured gas distributor.

Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV). Therefore, our CoTV can well balance the
achievement of the reduction of travel time, fuel, and emissions. In the

scalar field, which represents low-effective quantum corrections, assisted by a
function $f(\mathcal{G})$ solely depending from the Gauss-Bonnet topological
invariant $\mathcal{G}$. It is considered that the dark energy serves as the
impact of all geometric terms, which are included in the gravitational action
and the density of dark energy acts as a time dependent cosmological constant
evolving with an infinitesimal rate and driving the Universe into an
accelerating expansion. We examine two cosmological models of interest. The
first involves a canonical scalar field in the presence of a scalar potential
while the second, involves a scalar field which belongs to a generalized class
of theories $f(\phi,X)$ namely the k-essence scalar field in the absence of
scalar potential. As it is proved, the aforementioned models are in consistency
with the latest Planck data and in relatively good agreement with the
$\Lambda$CDM standard cosmological model. The absence of dark energy
oscillations at the early stages of matter dominated era, which appear in
alternative scenarios of cosmological dynamics in the context of modified

system performance on an evaluation set for all possible thresholds jointly,
enabling accurate computation not only of the PSD-ROC and PSDS but also of
other collar-based and intersection-based performance curves. It further allows
to select the threshold which best fulfills the requirements of a given

disks of gas and dust that are similar to protoplanetary disks around young
stars. We assembled a catalog of all known Galactic post-AGB binaries with
disks. We explore the correlations between the different observables with the
aim of learning more about potential disk-binary interactions. We compiled
spectral energy distributions of 85 Galactic post-AGB binary systems. We built
a color-color diagram to differentiate between the different disk morphologies
traced by the infrared excess. We categorized the different disk types and
searched for correlations with other observational characteristics of these
systems. Between 8 and 12% of our targets are surrounded by transition disks,
that is, disks having no or low near-infrared excess. We find a strong link
between these transition disks and the depletion of refractory elements on the
surface of the post-AGB star. We interpret this link as evidence of a mechanism
that stimulates the dust and gas separation within the disk and that also
produces the transition disk structure. We propose that such a mechanism is
likely to be due to a giant planet carving a hole in the disk, effectively
trapping the dust in the outer disk parts. We propose disk evolutionary
scenarios, depending on the presence of such a giant planet in the disk. We
advocate that giant planets can successfully explain the link between the
transition disks and the observed depletion of refractory materials. If the
planetary scenario is confirmed, disks around post-AGB binaries could be a
unique laboratory for testing planet-disk interactions and their influence on
the late evolution of binary stars. The question of whether such planets are
first- or second-generation bodies remains to be considered. We argue that
these disks are ideal for studying planet formation in unprecedented parameter

costly matrix computations that often require cubic time and quadratic storage.
This is often accomplished by performing operations that maintain such
structures, e.g. matrix inversion via the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula. In
this paper we consider the matrix square root and inverse square root
operations. Given a low rank perturbation to a matrix, we argue that a low-rank

establishing a geometric decay bound on the true correction's eigenvalues. We
then proceed to frame the correction as the solution of an algebraic Riccati

We analyze the approximation error incurred when approximately solving the

vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The backdoored DNN model will behave
maliciously when images containing backdoor triggers arrive. To date, existing
backdoor attacks are single-trigger and single-target attacks, and the triggers
of most existing backdoor attacks are obvious thus are easy to be detected or
noticed. In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and multi-channel
backdoor attack against Deep Neural Networks by exploiting Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) steganography. Based on the proposed backdoor attack method, we
implement two variants of backdoor attacks, i.e., N-to-N backdoor attack and
N-to-One backdoor attack. Specifically, for a colored image, we utilize DCT
steganography to construct the trigger on different channels of the image. As a
result, the trigger is stealthy and natural. Based on the proposed method, we
implement multi-target and multi-trigger backdoor attacks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the average attack success rate of the N-to-N backdoor attack
is 93.95% on CIFAR-10 dataset and 91.55% on TinyImageNet dataset, respectively.
The average attack success rate of N-to-One attack is 90.22% and 89.53% on
CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed
backdoor attack does not affect the classification accuracy of the DNN model.
Moreover, the proposed attack is demonstrated to be robust to the
state-of-the-art backdoor defense (Neural Cleanse).

temperature bias -- for weak tunneling in 1D interacting systems. We show that
the sign of the delta-T noise is generically determined by the nature of the
dominating tunneling process (more specifically, its scaling dimension). We
clarify the relation between the sign of delta-T noise and the quantum exchange
statistics of tunneling quasiparticles. We find that, for infinite systems
hosting chiral channels with local interactions (e.g., quantum Hall or quantum
spin Hall edges), when the delta-T noise is negative, the tunneling particles
are boson-like, revealing their tendency towards bunching. However, the
opposite is not true: Boson-like particles do not necessarily produce negative
delta-T noise. Importantly, the bosonic nature of particles generating the
negative delta-T is not necessarily intrinsic, but can be induced by the
interactions. This particularly implies that negative delta-T noise for
tunneling between the edge states cannot serve as a smoking gun for detecting
""intrinsic anyons"". We also establish a connection between the delta-T noise
and the temperature derivative of the thermal noise in interacting systems,
both governed by the same scaling dimensions. As a demonstration of the above
statements, we study tunneling between two interacting quantum spin Hall edges.
With bosonization and renormalization-group techniques, we find that many-body
interactions can generate negative delta-T noise for both direct tunneling
through a point contact and in Kondo exchange tunneling via a localized spin.
In both setups, we show that the noise can become negative at sufficiently low
temperatures, when interactions renormalize the tunneling to favor boson-like
pair-tunneling of electrons. Our findings show that delta-T noise can probe the
nature of collective excitations in interacting 1D systems.

patches of both cold and warm IGM around $z\simeq2-3$. The goal of this study
is to compare predictions of different blazar heating models with recent
observations of the IGM. We perform a set of cosmological simulations and
carefully compute mock observables of the Lyman-$\alpha\ ($Ly$\alpha$) forest.
We perform a detailed assessment of different systematic uncertainties which
typically impact this type of observables and find that they are smaller than
the differences between our models. We find that our inhomogeneous blazar
heating model is in good agreement with the Ly$\alpha$ line properties and the
rescaled flux probability distribution function at high redshift ($2.5<z<3$)

($2<z<2.5$). Our results could be explained by HeII reionisation although
state-of-the-art models fall short on providing enough heating to the
low-density IGM, thus motivating further radiative transfer studies of
inhomogeneous HeII reionisation. If blazars are indeed hosted by group-mass
halos of $2\times10^{13}{M}_\odot$, a later onset of blazar heating in
comparison to previous models would be favoured, which could bring our findings

the art to efficiently tackle perfect information two-player zero-sum games
with a win/lose outcome. However, when the win/lose outcome is decided by a
final score difference, AlphaZero may play score-suboptimal moves because all
winning final positions are equivalent from the win/lose outcome perspective.
This can be an issue, for instance when used for teaching, or when trying to
understand whether there is a better move. Moreover, there is the theoretical
quest for the perfect game. A naive approach would be training an
AlphaZero-like agent to predict score differences instead of win/lose outcomes.
Since the game of Go is deterministic, this should as well produce an
outcome-optimal play. However, it is a folklore belief that ""this does not
work"".
  In this paper, we first provide empirical evidence for this belief. We then
give a theoretical interpretation of this suboptimality in general perfect
information two-player zero-sum game where the complexity of a game like Go is
replaced by the randomness of the environment. We show that an outcome-optimal
policy has a different preference for uncertainty when it is winning or losing.
In particular, when in a losing state, an outcome-optimal agent chooses actions
leading to a higher score variance. We then posit that when approximation is
involved, a deterministic game behaves like a nondeterministic game, where the
score variance is modeled by how uncertain the position is. We validate this
hypothesis in AlphaZero-like software with a human expert.

applications, such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance systems.
In current practice, third-party resources such as datasets, backbone networks,
and training platforms are frequently used to train high-performance VOT
models. Whilst these resources bring certain convenience, they also introduce
new security threats into VOT models. In this paper, we reveal such a threat
where an adversary can easily implant hidden backdoors into VOT models by
tempering with the training process. Specifically, we propose a simple yet
effective few-shot backdoor attack (FSBA) that optimizes two losses
alternately: 1) a \emph{feature loss} defined in the hidden feature space, and
2) the standard \emph{tracking loss}. We show that, once the backdoor is
embedded into the target model by our FSBA, it can trick the model to lose
track of specific objects even when the \emph{trigger} only appears in one or a
few frames. We examine our attack in both digital and physical-world settings
and show that it can significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art
VOT trackers. We also show that our attack is resistant to potential defenses,
highlighting the vulnerability of VOT models to potential backdoor attacks.

performance on multiple challenging deep image retrieval benchmarks, but their
use of local features raises at least two issues. First, these local features
simply boil down to the localized map activations of a neural network, and
hence can be extremely redundant. Second, they are typically trained with a
global loss that only acts on top of an aggregation of local features; by
contrast, testing is based on local feature matching, which creates a
discrepancy between training and testing. In this paper, we propose a novel
architecture for deep image retrieval, based solely on mid-level features that
we call Super-features. These Super-features are constructed by an iterative
attention module and constitute an ordered set in which each element focuses on
a localized and discriminant image pattern. For training, they require only
image labels. A contrastive loss operates directly at the level of
Super-features and focuses on those that match across images. A second
complementary loss encourages diversity. Experiments on common landmark
retrieval benchmarks validate that Super-features substantially outperform
state-of-the-art methods when using the same number of features, and only
require a significantly smaller memory footprint to match their performance.

this goal is to accelerate and transport intense ion charge bunches in an
accelerator and then focus the charge bunches ballistically in a section of the
accelerator that contains a neutralizing background plasma. This requires the
ability to control space-charge effects during un-neutralized (non-neutral)
beam transport in the accelerator and transport sections, and the ability to
effectively neutralize the space charge and current by propagating the beam
through background plasma. As the beam intensity and energy are increased in
future heavy ion fusion (HIF) drivers and Fast Ignition (FI) approaches, it is
expected that nonlinear processes and collective effects will become much more
pronounced than in previous experiments. Making use of 3D electromagnetic
particle-in-cell simulation (PIC) codes (BEST, WARP-X, and LTP-PIC, etc.), the
theory and modelling studies will be validated by comparing with experimental

hosted, optically active defect centers. A very special type of defect center
arises from the possibility to host mechanically isolated orbitals localized
between the layers. The resulting absence of coupling to low-frequency acoustic
phonons turns out to be the essential element to protect the coherence of
optical transitions from mechanical interactions with the environment.
Consequently, the spectral transition linewidth remains unusually narrow even
at room temperature, thus paving a new way towards coherent quantum optics
under ambient conditions. In this review, I summarize the state-of-the-art of

employed Newtonian N-body codes and relies on only three simple modifications.
First, we use commonly employed backscaling initial conditions, based on the
cold dark matter plus baryon power spectrum instead of the total matter power
spectrum. Second, the accurate Hubble rate is employed in both the backscaling
and the evolution of particles in the N-body code. Finally, we shift the final
particle positions in a post-processing step to account for the integrated
effect of neutrinos on the particles in the simulation. However, we show that
the first two modifications already capture most of the relevant neutrino
physics for a large range of observationally interesting redshifts and scales.
The output of the simulations are the cold dark matter and baryon distributions
and can be analysed using standard methods. All modifications are simple to
implement and do not generate any computational overhead. By implementing our
methods in the N-body codes GADGET and gevolution, we show that any
state-of-the-art Newtonian N-body code can be utilised out of the box. Our
method is also compatible with higher order Lagrangian perturbation theory
initial conditions and accurate for combined neutrino masses of up to at least

the impact of massive neutrinos, our method further includes relativistic
corrections relevant on the large scales for free.

to ~34 au); (ii) it showed cometary activity already at almost 24 au; and (iii)
its nuclear magnitude (Hr ~ 8.0) indicates an exceptionally large object.
Detection of gases is expected in the upcoming years as the comet is heading
towards a ~11 au perihelion in 2031. We used ALMA in extended configuration
(resolution ~0.064"") to measure the 1287 um (233 GHz) continuum flux of the
comet. Observations were performed on August 8, 2021 at a 20.0 au distance from
the Sun. The high spatial resolution was chosen in order to filter out any dust
contribution. We detected the thermal emission of the object at ~10 sigma, with
a flux of 0.128+/-0.012 mJy. Based on observational constraints and our
theoretical estimates of the dust contribution, the entirety of the measured
flux can be attributed to the nucleus. From NEATM modelling combined with the
Hr magnitude, we determine a surface-equivalent diameter of 137+/-17 km and a
red geometric albedo of 5.3+/-1.2 %. This confirms that 2014 UN271 is by far
the largest Oort-cloud object ever found (almost twice as large as comet C/1995
O1 Hale-Bopp), and except for the Centaur 95P/Chiron which shows outburst-like
activity, the largest known comet in the Solar System. On the other hand, the
object albedo is typical of comets, adding credence for a ""universal"" comet
nucleus albedo. With its distant perihelion and uniquely large size, 2014 UN271
is the prominent archetype of distant comets, whose activity is driven by
hypervolatiles. Post-perihelion thermal measurements will permit to study
possible albedo changes, such as a surface brightening compared to
pre-perihelion, as was observed for Hale-Bopp.

propose a fast and accurate photon transport model which describes the physics
within the 1 keV to 1 MeV range using multiple controllable key parameters.
Based on this model, scatter computation for a single projection can be
completed within a range of few seconds under well-defined model parameters.
Smoothing and interpolation are performed on the estimated scatter to
accelerate the scatter calculation without compromising accuracy too much
compared to measured near scatter-free projection images. Combining the scatter
estimation with the filtered backprojection (FBP), scatter correction is
performed effectively in an iterative manner. In order to evaluate the proposed

excitons with large oscillator strength and potentially long-lived coherent
magnons due to the presence of bandgap and spatial confinement. While magnons
and excitons are energetically mismatched by orders of magnitude, their
coupling can lead to efficient optical access to spin information. Here we
report strong magnon-exciton coupling in the 2D van der Waals (vdW)
antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor CrSBr. Coherent magnons launched by
above-gap excitation modulate the interlayer hybridization, which leads to
dynamic modulation of excitonic energies. Time-resolved exciton sensing reveals
magnons that can coherently travel beyond 7 micrometer, with coherence time
above 5 ns. We observe this exciton-coupled coherent magnons in both even and
odd number of layers, with and without compensated magnetization, down to the
bilayer limit. Given the versatility of vdW heterostructures, these coherent 2D
magnons may be basis for optically accessible magnonics and quantum
interconnects.

likelihoods in Bayesian versions of generalised linear models (GLM). Marginal
likelihoods combined with model priors are then used in different search
algorithms to compute the posterior marginal probabilities of models and
individual covariates. This allows performing Bayesian model selection and
model averaging. For large sample sizes, even the Laplace approximation becomes
computationally challenging because the optimisation routine involved needs to
evaluate the likelihood on the full set of data in multiple iterations. As a
consequence, the algorithm is not scalable for large datasets. To address this
problem, we suggest using a version of a popular batch stochastic gradient
descent (BSGD) algorithm for estimating the marginal likelihood of a GLM by
subsampling from the data. We further combine the algorithm with Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) based methods for Bayesian model selection and provide some
theoretical results on the convergence of the estimates. Finally, we report
results from experiments illustrating the performance of the proposed
algorithm.

the temperature can be higher, up to about 4500 K (corresponding to a K5

English and the QWERTY keyboard, people tend to forgo using diacritics, make
typographical errors (typos) when typing in other languages. Restoring
diacritics and correcting spelling is important for proper language use and the
disambiguation of texts for both humans and downstream algorithms. However,
both of these problems are typically addressed separately: the state-of-the-art
diacritics restoration methods do not tolerate other typos, but classical
spellcheckers also cannot deal adequately with all the diacritics missing. In
this work, we tackle both problems at once by employing the newly-developed
universal ByT5 byte-level seq2seq transformer model that requires no
language-specific model structures. For a comparison, we perform diacritics
restoration on benchmark datasets of 12 languages, with the addition of
Lithuanian. The experimental investigation proves that our approach is able to
achieve results (> 98%) comparable to the previous state-of-the-art, despite
being trained less and on fewer data. Our approach is also able to restore
diacritics in words not seen during training with > 76% accuracy. Our
simultaneous diacritics restoration and typos correction approach reaches > 94%
alpha-word accuracy on the 13 languages. It has no direct competitors and
strongly outperforms classical spell-checking or dictionary-based approaches.
We also demonstrate all the accuracies to further improve with more training.
Taken together, this shows the great real-world application potential of our
suggested methods to more data, languages, and error classes.

shown state-of-the-art visual performance for image restoration problems.
However, their theoretical convergence analysis is still incomplete. Most of
the existing convergence results consider nonexpansive denoisers, which is
non-realistic, or limit their analysis to strongly convex data-fidelity terms

imager for proton-range monitoring, based on the results of the first Monte
Carlo study of its applicability to this field. i-TED is an array of Compton
cameras, that have been designed for neutron-capture nuclear physics
experiments, which are characterized by $\gamma$-ray energies spanning up to
5-6 MeV, rather low $\gamma$-ray emission yields and intense neutron induced
$\gamma$-ray backgrounds. Our developments to cope with these three aspects are
concomitant with those required in the field of hadron therapy, especially in
terms of high efficiency for real-time monitoring, low sensitivity to neutron
backgrounds and reliable performance at the high $\gamma$-ray energies. We find
that signal-to-background ratios can be appreciably improved with i-TED thanks
to its light-weight design and the low neutron-capture cross sections of its
LaCl$_{3}$ crystals, when compared to other similar systems based on LYSO,
CdZnTe or LaBr$_{3}$. Its high time-resolution (CRT$\sim$500 ps) represents an
additional advantage for background suppression when operated in pulsed HT
mode. Each i-TED module features two detection planes of very large LaCl$_{3}$
monolithic crystals, thereby achieving a high efficiency in coincidence of 0.2%
for a point-like 1MeV $\gamma$-ray source at 5 cm distance. This leads to
sufficient statistics for reliable image reconstruction with an array of four
i-TED detectors assuming clinical intensities of 10$^{8}$ protons per treatment
point. The use of a two-plane design instead of three-planes has been preferred
owing to the higher attainable efficiency for double time-coincidences than for
threefold events. The loss of full-energy events for high energy $\gamma$-rays
is compensated by means of Machine-Learning algorithms, which allow one to
enhance the signal-to-total ratio up to a factor of 2.

solution is an unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) system that can learn a
data distribution from an unlabelled dataset of healthy subjects and then be
applied to detect out of distribution samples. Such a technique can then be
used to detect anomalies - lesions or abnormalities, for example, brain
tumours, without explicitly training the model for that specific pathology.
Several Variational Autoencoder (VAE) based techniques have been proposed in
the past for this task. Even though they perform very well on controlled
artificially simulated anomalies, many of them perform poorly while detecting
anomalies in clinical data. This research proposes a compact version of the
""context-encoding"" VAE (ceVAE) model, combined with pre and post-processing
steps, creating a UAD pipeline (StRegA), which is more robust on clinical data,
and shows its applicability in detecting anomalies such as tumours in brain
MRIs. The proposed pipeline achieved a Dice score of 0.642$\pm$0.101 while
detecting tumours in T2w images of the BraTS dataset and 0.859$\pm$0.112 while
detecting artificially induced anomalies, while the best performing baseline
achieved 0.522$\pm$0.135 and 0.783$\pm$0.111, respectively.

modeled by the viscous Saint-Venant PDE system. The control input is the
acceleration of the tank and a Control Lyapunov Functional methodology is used.
The measurements are the tank position and the liquid level at the tank walls.
The control scheme is a combination of a state feedback law with functional
observers for the tank velocity and the liquid momentum. Four different types
of output feedback stabilizers are proposed. A full-order observer and a
reduced-order observer are used in order to estimate the tank velocity while
the unmeasured liquid momentum is either estimated by using an appropriate
scalar filter or is ignored. The reduced order observer differs from the full
order observer because it omits the estimation of the measured tank position.
Exponential convergence of the closed-loop system to the desired equilibrium
point is achieved in each case. An algorithm is provided that guarantees that a
robotic arm can move a glass of water to a pre-specified position no matter how
full the glass is, without spilling water out of the glass, without residual
end point sloshing and without measuring the water momentum and the glass
velocity. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed output feedback laws is
validated by numerical examples, obtained by using a simple finite-difference
numerical scheme. The properties of the proposed, explicit, finite-difference
scheme are determined.

ultra-short period (USP) planets. They are relatively rare products of
planetary formation and evolution processes, but especially favourable for
characterisation with current planet detection methods. At the time of writing,
125 USP planets have already been confirmed. Aims. Our aim is to validate the
planetary nature of two new transiting planet candidates around M dwarfs
announced by the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), registered
as TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) TOI-1442.01 and TOI-2445.01. Methods. We
used TESS data, ground-based photometric light curves, and Subaru/IRD
spectrograph radial velocity (RV) measurements to validate both planetary
candidates and to establish their physical properties. Results. TOI-1442 b is a
validated exoplanet with an orbital period of $P$=0.4090682+/-0.0000004 d, a
radius of $R_p$=1.15+/-0.06$R_{\oplus}$, and equilibrium temperature of
$T_{p,eq}$=1357$_{-42}^{+49}$K. TOI-2445 b is also validated with an orbital
period of $P$=0.3711286+/-0.0000004 d, a radius of $R_p$=
1.33+/-0.09$R_{\oplus}$, and equilibrium temperature of
$T_{p,eq}$=1330$_{-56}^{+61}$K. Their physical properties align with current
empirical trends and formation theories of USP planets. Based on the RV
measurements, we set 3$\sigma$ upper mass limits of 8$M_{\oplus}$ and
20$M_{\oplus}$, thus confirming the non-stellar, sub-Jovian nature of both
transiting objects. More RV measurements will be needed to constrain the
planetary masses and mean densities, and the predicted presence of outer
planetary companions. These targets extend the small sample of USP planets
orbiting around M dwarfs up to 21 members. They are also among the 20 most
suitable terrestrial planets for atmospheric characterisation via secondary
eclipse with the JWST, according to a widespread emission spectroscopy metric.

Aims. In order to study the physics of the accretion process in greater detail,

system, we supplement our previous results obtained from photometry with an
analysis of the spectra of UU Cas. Methods. We collected all available spectra
used in previous publications on UU Cas and we acquired new ones. The method of
disentangling was applied to this set of spectra spanning the years 2008-2021.
The orbital parameters were disentangled and a fit of the separated component
spectra by synthetic ones has been used to determine the physical parameters of
the component stars. We compared the results to models of the evolution of
interacting binaries. Results. We found that in addition to the dominant role
of the donor star and a weak contribution of the gainer, the line profiles are
strongly influenced by the circumstellar matter. The absorption lines reveal a
presence of a disk wind emanating above the orbital plane. The variability of
H{\alpha} emission yields evidence of changes in the structure of the
circumstellar matter on a timescale of several orbital periods.

states of matter that can be tuned by electrostatic doping. Superconductivity
has drawn considerable attention and the mechanism behind it is a topic of
active discussion. MATBG has been experimentally characterized by numerous
transport and scanning-probe experiments. The material has also emerged as a
versatile platform for superconducting electronics, as proven by the
realization of monolithic Josephson junctions. However, even though
phase-coherent phenomena have been measured, no control of the superconducting
phase has been demonstrated so far. Here, we present a Superconducting Quantum
Interference Device (SQUID) in MATBG, where the superconducting phase
difference is controlled through the magnetic field. We observe
magneto-oscillations of the critical current, demonstrating long-range
coherence agreeing with an effective charge of 2e for the superconducting
charge carriers. We tune to both asymmetric and symmetric SQUID configurations
by electrostatically controlling the critical currents through the junctions.
With this tunability, we study the inductances in the device, finding values of
up to 2{\mu}H. Furthermore, we directly observe the current-phase relation of
one of the Josephson junctions of the device. Our results show that
superconducting devices in MATBG can be scaled up and used to reveal properties
of the material. We expect this to foster a more systematic realization of
devices of this type, increasing the accuracy with which microscopic
characteristics of the material are extracted. We also envision more complex
devices to emerge, such as phase-slip junctions or high kinetic inductance
detectors.

architecture, trained solely with synthetic images, allows simultaneous pose
estimation of multiple objects with reduced GPU memory consumption and enhanced

edge-based refinement step that explicitly exploits known object geometry

pose mismatches due to geometric ambiguities or occlusions. We showcase the
entire tracking pipeline and demonstrate the benefits of the combined approach.
Experiments on a challenging set of non-textured similar objects demonstrate
the enhanced quality compared to the baseline method. Finally, we illustrate
how the system can be used in a real AR assistance application within the field

it requires taking into account the associations between variables with
different level of measurement, i.e., nominal, ordinal and/or interval. In some
cases, hierarchical clustering is considered a suitable approach, as it makes
few assumptions about the data and its solution can be easily visualized. Since
most hierarchical clustering approaches assume variables are measured on the
same scale, a simple strategy for clustering mixed-type data is to homogenize
the variables before clustering. This would mean either recoding the continuous
variables as categorical ones or vice versa. However, typical discretization of
continuous variables implies loss of information. In this work, an
agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach for mixed-type data is proposed,
which relies on a barycentric coding of continuous variables. The proposed
approach minimizes information loss and is compatible with the framework of
correspondence analysis. The utility of the method is demonstrated on real and
simulated data.

detectors in the Double Chooz experiment. The electron antineutrinos of the
Chooz nuclear power plant were measured in two identically designed detectors
with different average baselines of about 400 m and 1050 m from the two reactor
cores. Over many years of data taking the neutrino signals were extracted from
interactions in the detectors with the goal of measuring a fundamental
parameter in the context of neutrino oscillation, the mixing angle {\theta}13.
The central part of the Double Chooz detectors was a main detector comprising
four cylindrical volumes filled with organic liquids. From the inside towards
the outside there were volumes containing gadolinium-loaded scintillator,
gadolinium-free scintillator, a buffer oil and, optically separated, another
liquid scintillator acting as veto system. Above this main detector an
additional outer veto system using plastic scintillator strips was installed.
The technologies developed in Double Chooz were inspiration for several other
antineutrino detectors in the field. The detector design allowed implementation
of efficient background rejection techniques including use of pulse shape
information provided by the data acquisition system. The Double Chooz detectors
featured remarkable stability, in particular for the detected photons, as well
as high radiopurity of the detector components.

require the reconstruction of charged particle trajectories. Methods of
reconstructing such trajectories have been known for decades, yet the
applications at High Luminosity LHC require this reconstruction to be fast
enough to be suitable for online event filtering.
  A particle traversing the detector volume leaves signals in active detector
elements from which the trajectory is reconstructed. If the detector is
submerged in a uniform magnetic field that trajectory is approximately helical.
Since a collision event results in the production of many particles, especially
at high luminosities, the first phase of trajectory reconstruction is the
formation of candidate trajectories composed of a small subset of detector
measurements that are then subject of resource intensive precise track
parameters estimation.
  In this paper, we suggest a new approach that could be used to perform this
classification. The proposed procedure utilizes the $z$ coordinate in the
longitudinal direction in addition to the $x, y$ coordinates in the plane
perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The suggested algorithm
works equally well for helical trajectories with different proximities to the
beamline which is beneficial when searching for products of particles with

development of solutions for visual explanations of CNNs. Given the high cost
of user studies, metrics are necessary to compare and evaluate these different
methods. In this paper, we critically analyze the Deletion Area Under Curve
(DAUC) and Insertion Area Under Curve (IAUC) metrics proposed by Petsiuk et al.
(2018). These metrics were designed to evaluate the faithfulness of saliency
maps generated by generic methods such as Grad-CAM or RISE. First, we show that
the actual saliency score values given by the saliency map are ignored as only
the ranking of the scores is taken into account. This shows that these metrics
are insufficient by themselves, as the visual appearance of a saliency map can
change significantly without the ranking of the scores being modified.
Secondly, we argue that during the computation of DAUC and IAUC, the model is
presented with images that are out of the training distribution which might
lead to an unreliable behavior of the model being explained. To complement
DAUC/IAUC, we propose new metrics that quantify the sparsity and the
calibration of explanation methods, two previously unstudied properties.
Finally, we give general remarks about the metrics studied in this paper and
discuss how to evaluate them in a user study.

In this work, we develop a dynamic, robust and strongly consistent distributed

do so by integrating an Adaptive, Reconfigurable, Atomic Storage framework,
called ARES, with a distributed file system, called COBFS, which relies on a
block fragmentation technique to handle large objects. With the addition of
ARES, we also enable the use of an erasure-coded algorithm to further split our
data and to potentially improve storage efficiency at the replica servers and
operation latency. To put the practicality of our outcomes at test, we conduct
an in-depth experimental evaluation on the Emulab and AWS EC2 testbeds,
illustrating the benefits of our approaches, as well as other interesting

stellar-mass black hole (BH). We used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to carry
out precise astrometry of the source star of the long-duration (t_E~270 days),
high-magnification microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-191/OGLE-2011-BLG-0462
(hereafter designated as MOA-11-191/OGLE-11-462), in the direction of the
Galactic bulge. HST imaging, conducted at eight epochs over an interval of six
years, reveals a clear relativistic astrometric deflection of the background
star's apparent position. Ground-based photometry of MOA-11-191/OGLE-11-462
shows a parallactic signature of the effect of the Earth's motion on the
microlensing light curve. Combining the HST astrometry with the ground-based
light curve and the derived parallax, we obtain a lens mass of 7.1 +/- 1.3 Msun
and a distance of 1.58 +/- 0.18 kpc. We show that the lens emits no detectable
light, which, along with having a mass higher than is possible for a white
dwarf or neutron star, confirms its BH nature. Our analysis also provides an
absolute proper motion for the BH. The proper motion is offset from the mean
motion of Galactic-disk stars at similar distances by an amount corresponding
to a transverse space velocity of ~45 km/s, suggesting that the BH received a
'natal kick' from its supernova explosion. Previous mass determinations for
stellar-mass BHs have come from radial-velocity measurements of Galactic X-ray
binaries, and from gravitational radiation emitted by merging BHs in binary
systems in external galaxies. Our mass measurement is the first for an isolated
stellar-mass BH using any technique.

an important class of systems: safety-critical systems. Ensuring the safety of

proposed SCA aims to address this challenge by using a Model Predictive
Controller (MPC) that acts as a supervisor for the operating controller, in the
sense that the MPC constantly checks the safety of the control inputs generated
by the operating controller and intervenes if the control input is predicted to
lead to a hazardous situation in the foreseeable future invariably. Then an
appropriate backup scheme can be activated, e.g., a degraded control mechanism,
the transfer of the system to a safe state, or a warning signal issued to a
human supervisor. For a proof of concept, the proposed SCA is applied to an
autonomous driving scenario, where it is illustrated and compared in different
obstacle avoidance scenarios. A major challenge of the SCA lies in the mismatch
between the MPC prediction model and the real system, for which possible
remedies are explored.

  Case Study","8 pages, 4 figures, IEEE CCNC 2022",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Providing differentiated services to meet the unique requirements of
different use cases is a major goal of the fifth generation (5G)
telecommunication networks and will be even more critical for future 6G
systems. Fulfilling this goal requires the ability to assure quality of service
(QoS) end to end (E2E), which remains a challenge. A key factor that makes E2E
QoS assurance difficult in a telecommunication system is that access networks
(ANs) and core networks (CNs) manage their resources autonomously. So far, few
results have been available that can ensure E2E QoS over autonomously managed
ANs and CNs. Existing techniques rely predominately on each subsystem to meet
static local QoS budgets with no recourse in case any subsystem fails to meet
its local budgets and, hence will have difficulty delivering E2E assurance.
Moreover, most existing distributed optimization techniques that can be applied
to assure E2E QoS over autonomous subsystems require the subsystems to exchange
sensitive information such as their local decision variables. This paper
presents a novel framework and a distributed algorithm that can enable ANs and
CNs to autonomously ""cooperate"" with each other to dynamically negotiate their
local QoS budgets and to collectively meet E2E QoS goals by sharing only their
estimates of the global constraint functions, without disclosing their local
decision variables. We prove that this new distributed algorithm converges to
an optimal solution almost surely, and also present numerical results to
demonstrate that the convergence occurs quickly even with measurement noise.

performance improvement could be related to the neighbor images' similarity to

into schema matching, entity matching and record merging. To solve the latter,
it is mostly assumed that ground truth can be determined, either as master data
or from user feedback. However, in many cases, this is not the case because
firstly the merging processes cannot be accurate enough, and also the data
gathering processes in the different sources are simply imperfect and cannot
provide high quality data. Instead of enforcing consistency, we propose to
evaluate how concordant or discordant sources are as a measure of
trustworthiness (the more discordant are the sources, the less we can trust
their data).
  Thus, we define the discord measurement problem in which given a set of
uncertain raw observations or aggregate results (such as
case/hospitalization/death data relevant to COVID-19) and information on the
alignment of different data (for example, cases and deaths), we wish to assess
whether the different sources are concordant, or if not, measure how discordant
they are. We also define a set of algebraic operators to describe the
alignments, together with two alternative relational implementations that
reduce the problem to linear or quadratic programming. These are evaluated
against both COVID-19 and synthetic data, and our experimental results show
that discordancy measurement can be performed efficiently in realistic
situations.

significant enough to impair function in activities of daily living. Patients
seen in dementia specialty clinics are highly heterogeneous with a variety of
different symptoms that progress at different rates. In this work, we used an
unsupervised data-driven K-Means clustering approach on the component scores of
the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score to identify dementia subtypes and used
the gap-statistic to identify the optimal number of clusters. Our goal was to
characterize the identified dementia subtypes in terms of their cognitive
performance and analyze how patient transitions between subtypes relate to
disease progression. Our results indicate both inter-subtype variability, which
indicates the variability amongst dementia subtypes for a particular component
score even with the same CDR and (ii) intra-subtype variability, which
indicates the variation in the 6 component scores within a particular dementia
subtype. We observed that dementia subtypes that represented individuals with
very mild dementia (CDR 0.5) had widely varying rates of transition to other
subtypes. Future work includes testing the generalizability of our proposed
pipeline on additional datasets, and using a larger volume of EHR data to
estimate probabilistic estimates of the variability between dementia subtypes
both in terms of cognitive profile and disease progression.

black holes and naked singularities surrounded by anisotropic dark matter fluid

dark matter is made of weakly interacting particles orbiting around the
supermassive black hole in the galactic center and the dark matter halo is
formed by means of Einstein clusters having only tangential pressure. In the
large distance from the black hole, we obtain the constant flat curve with the
upper bound for the dark matter state parameter $\omega \lesssim 10^{-7}$. To
this end, we also check the energy conditions of the dark matter fluid outside
the black hole/naked singularity, the deflection of light by the galaxy, and
the shadow images of the Sgr A$^\star$ black hole using the rotating and
radiating particles. For the black hole case, we find that the effect of dark
matter fluid on the shadow radius is small, in particular the angular radius of
the black hole is shown to increase by the order $10^{-4} \mu$arcsec compared
to the vacuum solution. For the naked singularity we obtain significantly
smaller shadow radius compared to the black hole case. Finally, we study the
stability of the S2 star orbit around Sgr A$^\star$ black hole under dark
matter effects. It is argued that the motion of S2 star orbit is stable for
values $\omega \lesssim 10^{-7}$, however further increase of $\omega $ leads
to unstable orbits. Using the observational result for the shadow images of the
Sgr A$^\star$ reported by the EHT along with the tightest constraint for
$\omega$ found from the constant flat curve, we show that the black hole model
is consistent with the data while the naked singularity in our model can be
ruled out.

(LPTV) systems, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) that depend on a time variable t and have a matrix of coefficients with

periodic-function matrix A(t)=A(t+T) can be expressed as the product of a
square periodic function matrix P(t)=P(t+T) and an exponentiated square matrix
of the form Rt, where R is a constant matrix (independent of t). Despite the
validity of Floquet theory, it is difficult to find an analytical closed form
for the matrices P(t) and R when the transition matrix {\Phi}_A (t,t_0 ) is
unknown. In essence, it is difficult to find an analytical solution for an LPTV
system (i.e., a closed form for its transition matrix). The research results
show that for a given family of periodic matrices A(t), we can compare the
powers of {\omega} that multiply the harmonics (i.e., {\omega} is part of the
coefficients multiplying the cosine [sine] factors in even [odd]
representations or of the exponential factors in complex representations) to
determine the matrices P(t) and R. In addition, the results lead to relations
between LPTV systems at frequency {\omega} and the associated linear
time-invariant system, which is defined by having zero frequency ({\omega}=0).

Gaussian Process regression to estimate the number of cases during the first
2020 wave based on the second wave of the epidemic in several European
countries, South Korea, and Brazil. We assume that the second wave was more
accurately monitored and hence that it can be trusted. We then construct a
manifold diffeomorphic to that of the implied original dynamical system, using
fatalities or hospitalizations only. Finally, we restrict the diffeomorphism to
the reported cases coordinate of the dynamical system. Our main finding is that
in the European countries studied, the actual cases are under-reported by as
much as 50\%. On the other hand, in South Korea -- which had an exemplary and
proactive mitigation approach -- a far smaller discrepancy between the actual
and reported cases is predicted, with an approximately 17\% predicted
under-estimation. We believe that our backcasting framework is applicable to
other epidemic outbreaks where (due to limited or poor quality data) there is
uncertainty around the actual cases.

the vast majority of the so-called community-aware centrality measures rely on
non-overlapping community structure. However, in many real-world networks, such
as social networks, the communities overlap. In other words, a node can belong
to multiple communities. To overcome this drawback, we propose and investigate
the ""Overlapping Modularity Vitality"" centrality measure. This extension of
""Modularity Vitality"" quantifies the community structure strength variation
when removing a node. It allows identifying a node as a hub or a bridge based
on its contribution to the overlapping modularity of a network. A comparative
analysis with its non-overlapping version using the
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic diffusion model has been
performed on a set of six real-world networks. Overall, Overlapping Modularity
Vitality outperforms its alternative. These results illustrate the importance
of incorporating knowledge about the overlapping community structure to

effective than choosing the ones with the maximum negative values to spread the

comprehensive search for hydrous compounds, stable at conditions of the deep
Earth and made of Earth-abundant elements. Previous studies usually focused on
the current range of pressure-temperature conditions in the Earth's mantle and
ignored a possible difference in the past, such as the stage of the core-mantle
separation. Here, using ab initio evolutionary structure prediction, we find
that only two magnesium hydrosilicate phases are stable at megabar pressures,
$\alpha$-Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ and $\beta$-Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$, stable at 262-338
GPa and >338 GPa,respectively (all these pressures now lie within the Earth's
iron core). Both are superionic conductors with quasi-one-dimensional proton
diffusion at relevant conditions. In the first 30 million years of Earth's
history, before the Earth's core was formed, these must have existed in the
Earth, hosting much of Earth's water. As dense iron alloys segregated to form
the Earth's core, Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ phases decomposed and released water.
Thus, now-extinct Mg$_2$SiO$_5$H$_2$ phases have likely contributed in a major
way to the evolution of our planet.

demonstrated here, special biconical type antennas featuring a 3D printed

systems probe astrophysical neutron star (NS) and black hole (BH) mass
distributions, especially at the transition between NS and BH masses. Of
particular interest are the maximum NS mass, minimum BH mass, and potential
mass gap between them. While previous GW population analyses assumed all NSs
obey the same maximum mass, if rapidly spinning NSs exist, they can extend to
larger maximum masses than nonspinning NSs. In fact, several authors have
proposed that the $\sim2.6\,M_\odot$ object in the event GW190814 -- either the
most massive NS or least massive BH observed to date -- is a rapidly spinning
NS. We therefore infer the NSBH mass distribution jointly with the NS spin
distribution, modeling the NS maximum mass as a function of spin. Using 4
LIGO-Virgo NSBH events including GW190814, if we assume that the NS spin
distribution is uniformly distributed up to the maximum (breakup) spin, we
infer the maximum non-spinning NS mass is $2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}\,M_\odot$ (90\%
credibility), while assuming only nonspinning NSs, the NS maximum mass must be
$>2.53 M_\odot$ (90\% credibility). The data support the mass gap's existence,
with a minimum BH mass at $5.4^{+0.7}_{-1.0} M_\odot$. With future
observations, under simplified assumptions, 150 NSBH events may constrain the
maximum nonspinning NS mass to $\pm0.02\,M_\odot$, and we may even measure the
relation between the NS spin and maximum mass entirely from GW data. If rapidly
rotating NSs exist, their spins and masses must be modeled simultaneously to
avoid biasing the NS maximum mass.

species, for instance, by photoionization, a layer of hydrated water molecules
forms around the solute on a time scale of a few picoseconds. We study the
dynamic build-up of the hydration shell around a hydrophobic solute on the
basis of a time-dependent dielectric continuum model. Information about the
solvent is spectroscopically extracted from the relaxation dynamics of a test
dipole inside a static Onsager sphere in the nonequilibrium solvent. The growth
process is described phenomenologically within two approaches. First, we
consider a time-dependent thickness of the hydration layer which grows from
zero to a finite value over a finite time. Second, we assume a time-dependent
complex permittivity within a finite layer region around the Onsager sphere.
The layer is modeled as a continuous dielectric with a much slower fluctuation
dynamics. We find a time-dependent frequency shift down to the blue of the
resonant absorption of the dipole, together with a dynamically decreasing line
width, as compared to bulk water. The blue shift reflects the work performed
against the hydrogen bonded network of the bulk solvent and is a directly
measurable quantity. Our results are in agreement with an experiment on the
hydrophobic solvation of iodine in water.
