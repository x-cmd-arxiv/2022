various random graph models. Existing methods can simulate city-scale or even
country-scale contact networks, but they are unable to feasibly simulate
global-scale contact networks due to high memory consumption. NiemaGraphGen
(NGG) is a memory-efficient graph generation tool that enables the simulation
of global-scale contact networks. NGG avoids storing the entire graph in memory
and is instead intended to be used in a data streaming pipeline, resulting in
memory consumption that is orders of magnitude smaller than existing tools. NGG
provides a massively-scalable solution for simulating social contact networks,
enabling global-scale epidemic simulation studies.

of points in time or space. They are natural models for a wide range of
phenomena, ranging from neural spike trains to document streams. The clustering
property is achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of
latent events is drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event
generates a set of observed data points according to another Poisson process.
This construction is similar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the
Dirichlet process mixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events
(i.e. clusters) is a random variable, but the point process formulation makes
the NSP especially well suited to modeling spatiotemporal data. While many
specialized algorithms have been developed for DPMMs, comparatively fewer works
have focused on inference in NSPs. Here, we present novel connections between
NSPs and DPMMs, with the key link being a third class of Bayesian mixture
models called mixture of finite mixture models (MFMMs). Leveraging this
connection, we adapt the standard collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for DPMMs
to enable scalable Bayesian inference on NSP models. We demonstrate the
potential of Neyman-Scott processes on a variety of applications including
sequence detection in neural spike trains and event detection in document
streams.

scattering potential are active depending on the impurity configuration and
choice of orbitals for the effective low-energy description of the normal

that only the symmetric share of impurity configurations contribute to
scattering, such that polar impurities are completely inactive. We also find
that a more dominant mass-imbalance term in the normal-state Hamiltonian can
make the superconducting state more robust to intercalated impurities, in
contrast to the case of on-site or interstitial impurities.

technique with a complete motion planning and perception framework that
accounts for the predicted motion of humans in dynamic environments, enabling
reactive and pre-emptive motion planning that incorporates predicted motions.
To achieve this, we propose and implement a novel human trajectory prediction
method that combines intention recognition with trajectory optimisation-based
motion planning. We validate our resultant framework on a real-world Toyota

molecular cloud obtained using the POL-2 polarimeter on the James Clerk Maxwell
Telescope (JCMT) as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observations
(BISTRO) survey. These observations probe the magnetic field morphology of the
Serpens Main molecular cloud on about 6000 au scales, which consists of cores
and six filaments with different physical properties such as density and star
formation activity. Using the histogram of relative orientation (HRO)
technique, we find that magnetic fields are parallel to filaments in less dense
filamentary structures where $N_{H_2} < 0.93\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ (magnetic
fields perpendicular to density gradients), while being perpendicular to
filaments (magnetic fields parallel to density gradients) in dense filamentary
structures with star formation activity. Moreover, applying the HRO technique
to denser core regions, we find that magnetic field orientations change to
become perpendicular to density gradients again at $N_{H_2} \approx 4.6 \times
10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. This can be interpreted as a signature of core formation.
At $N_{H_2} \approx 16 \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ magnetic fields change back to
being parallel to density gradients once again, which can be understood to be
due to magnetic fields being dragged in by infalling material. In addition, we
estimate the magnetic field strengths of the filaments ($B_{POS} =
60-300~\mu$G)) using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and discuss whether
the filaments are gravitationally unstable based on magnetic field and
turbulence energy densities.

they are sensitive to some deviations in distribution when the observed samples

fictional data distribution). Likewise, statistical advances lag in supporting
comprehensive data-driven analyses of complex multi-omics data integration. We
propose a novel non-linear M-estimator-based approach, ""robust kernel machine
regression (RobKMR),"" to improve the robustness of statistical machine
regression and the diversity of fictional data to examine the higher-order
composite effect of multi-omics datasets. We address a robust kernel-centered
Gram matrix to estimate the model parameters accurately. We also propose a
robust score test to assess the marginal and joint Hadamard product of features
from multi-omics data. We apply our proposed approach to a multi-omics dataset
of osteoporosis (OP) from Caucasian females. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach effectively identifies the inter-related risk factors of OP.
With solid evidence (p-value = 0.00001), biological validations, network-based
analysis, causal inference, and drug repurposing, the selected three triplets

Modelling words as vectors is key to natural language processing, whereas
networks of word associations can map the nature of semantic memory. We
reconcile these paradigms - fragmented across linguistics, psychology and
computer science - by introducing FEature-Rich MUltiplex LEXical (FERMULEX)
networks. This novel framework merges structural similarities in networks and
vector features of words, which can be combined or explored independently.
Similarities model heterogenous word associations across
semantic/syntactic/phonological aspects of knowledge. Words are enriched with
multi-dimensional feature embeddings including frequency, age of acquisition,
length and polysemy. These aspects enable unprecedented explorations of
cognitive knowledge. Through CHILDES data, we use FERMULEX networks to model
normative language acquisition by 1000 toddlers between 18 and 30 months.
Similarities and embeddings capture word homophily via conformity, which
measures assortative mixing via distance and features. Conformity unearths a
language kernel of frequent/polysemous/short nouns and verbs key for basic
sentence production, supporting recent evidence of children's syntactic
constructs emerging at 30 months. This kernel is invisible to network
core-detection and feature-only clustering: It emerges from the dual
vector/network nature of words. Our quantitative analysis reveals two key
strategies in early word learning. Modelling word acquisition as random walks
on FERMULEX topology, we highlight non-uniform filling of communicative
developmental inventories (CDIs). Conformity-based walkers lead to accurate
(75%), precise (55%) and partially well-recalled (34%) predictions of early
word learning in CDIs, providing quantitative support to previous empirical
findings and developmental theories.

subject to a static, inhomogeneous ($1/r$-decaying) magnetic field, including
the Zeeman interaction. The solution provides access to many-body properties of
a two-dimensional, non-interacting, electron gas in the thermodynamic limit.
Radially distorted Landau levels can be identified as well as magnetic field
induced density and current oscillations close to the magnetic impurity. These
radially localised oscillations depend strongly on the coupling of the spin to
the magnetic field, which give rise to non-trivial spin currents. Moreover, the
Zeeman interaction introduces a lowest flat band for $E_F=0^+$ assuming a spin
$g_s$-factor of two. Surprisingly, in this case the charge and current
densities can be computed analytically in the thermodynamic limit. Numerical
calculations show that the total magnetic response of the electron gas remains
diamagnetic (similar to Landau levels) independent of the Fermi energy.
However, the contribution of certain, infinitely degenerate energy levels may
become paramagnetic. Furthermore, numerical computations of the Hall
conductivity reveal asymptotic properties of the electron gas, which are driven
by the anisotropy of the vector potential instead of the magnetic field, i.e.
become independent of spin. Eventually, the distorted Landau levels give rise
to different Hall conductivity phases, which are characterized by sharp sign
flips at specific Fermi energies. Overall, our work merges ""impurity"" with
Landau-level physics, which provides novel physical insights, not only locally,
but also in the asymptotic limit. This paves the way for a large number of

characterize the computational limits of a single multithreaded PIM core.
Second, we design various load balancing schemes across multiple PIM cores, and
two types of data partitioning techniques to execute SpMV on thousands of PIM
cores: (1) 1D-partitioned kernels to perform the complete SpMV computation only
using PIM cores, and (2) 2D-partitioned kernels to strive a balance between
computation and data transfer costs to PIM-enabled memory. Third, we compare
SpMV execution on a real-world PIM system with 2528 PIM cores to
state-of-the-art CPU and GPU systems to study the performance and energy
efficiency of various devices. SparseP software package provides 25 SpMV

cross-correlation between the optical depth and galaxy clustering ($\tau g$),
and compare this model to cosmological simulations. We constrain the optical
depths of halos at $z\lesssim 3$ using a technique originally devised to
constrain patchy reionization at a much higher redshift range. The forecasted
signal-to-noise ratio is 2.6, 8.5, and 13, respectively, for a CMB-S4-like

these probes can constrain the amplitude of the density profiles of halos to
6.5% and the pressure profile to 13%, marginalizing over the outer slope of the

related to the physics of galaxy evolution, such as the gas mass fraction,
$f_{\rm g}$, which can be constrained to 5.3% uncertainty at $z\sim 0$,
assuming an underlying model for the shape of the density profile. The
cross-correlations presented here are complementary to other CMB and galaxy

method, unlike the other clustering algorithms, uses two different objective

to: 1) reduce computation time by using idle times to apply genetic operations

have yet a complete picture of their properties (extension, geometry,
orientation and clumpiness). For low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs),
in particular, low-ionisation nuclear emission line regions (LINERs), the rate
of outflows and their properties are largely unknown. The main goal of this
work is to create the largest, up-to-date atlas of ionised gas outflow
candidates in a sample of 70 nearby LINERs. We use narrow-band, imaging data to
analyse the morphological properties of the ionised gas nuclear emission of
these galaxies and to identify signatures of extended emission with distinctive
outflow-like morphologies. We obtained new imaging data from ALFOSC/NOT for 32
LINERs. We complemented it with HST archival data for 6 objects and with
results from the literature for other 32 targets. We additionally obtained soft
X-ray data from Chandra archive to compare with the ionised gas. The
distribution of the ionised gas in these LINER shows that $\sim$32% have
bubble-like emission, $\sim$28% show a 'Core-halo', unresolved emission, and
$\sim$21% have a disky-like distribution. Dust lanes prevent a detailed
classification for $\sim$11% of the sample ('Dusty'). If we account for the
kinematical information, available for 60 galaxies, we end up with 48% of the
LINERs with detected outflows/inflows (50% considering only kinematical
information based on Integral Field Spectroscopy). Our results suggest that the
incidence of outflows in LINERs may vary from 41% up to 56%, based on both the
Halpha morphology and the kinematical information from the literature. The
ionised gas is co-spatial with the soft X-ray emission for the majority of
cases ($\sim$60%), so that they may have a common origin. We discuss the use of
Halpha imaging for the pre-selection of candidates likely hosting ionised gas
outflows.

Different from three right-handed neutrino singlets in the type-I seesaw model,
the Higgs triplet in the type-II seesaw model participates directly in the
electroweak gauge interactions, rendering the EFT construction more
challenging. By integrating out the heavy Higgs triplet in the
functional-integral formalism, we carry out a complete one-loop matching of the

obtained, covering all those 31 dimension-six operators in the case of type-I

indicate that quantum coherence in the bipartite state oscillates in the
unbroken phase regime of the PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Interestingly, in the
broken phase regime, while the global coherence decays exponentially, the local
and total coherences enter a 'freezing' regime where they attain a stable value
over time. A similar pattern is observed for the dynamics of total and local
coherences in the maximally entangled tripartite state, while the dynamics of
global coherence in this state differs from that of the bipartite state. These
results were experimentally validated for a maximally entangled bipartite state
on a three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum processor, with one
of the qubits acting as an ancilla. The experimental results match well with

introduce a simplified version of the model with an organisation of the

  We derive an explicit and interpretable variational formula in the

us to prove a number of properties of the limiting free energy as a function of

capable of establishing a 5-leg link in X- and Ka-band to obtain 2-way
range-rate measurements with an accuracy of $0.01 mm/s^-1$ @ 60 s sampling time
and 2-way range measurements at centimeter level after a few seconds of
integration time, at almost all solar elongation angles. In this paper, we
investigate if the light-time formulation derived by Moyer, implemented in
JPL's orbit determination code MONTE, is still a valid approximation, in light
of the recent advancements in radiometric measurement performance. Several
formulations of the gravitational time delay, expressed as an expansion in
powers of $GM/c^2r$, are considered in this work. We quantified the
contribution of each term of the light-time expansion for the first superior
solar conjunction experiment of BepiColombo. The maximum 2-way error caused by
Moyer approximation with respect to a complete second order expansion amounts
to 17 mm. This is at the level of accuracy of the novel pseudo-noise (PN)
ranging system at 24 Mcps used by MORE. A complete second order expansion is
then recommended for present and future superior solar conjunction experiments.

well, resulting in significant effects due to the Jupiter, the Earth and the

that CFT observables $\mathcal{O}$, invariant under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$
transformations of a complexified gauge coupling $\tau$, admit a unique
spectral decomposition into a basis of square-integrable functions. This
formulation has direct implications for the analytic structure of
$\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM data, both perturbatively and non-perturbatively in all
parameters. For example, $k$-instanton sectors are uniquely determined by the
zero- and one-instanton sectors, and Borel summable series around
$k$-instantons have convergence radii with simple $k$-dependence. In large $N$
limits, we derive the existence and scaling of non-perturbative effects, which
we exhibit for certain $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM observables. An elegant benchmark
for these techniques is the integrated four-point function conjecturally
determined by [arXiv:2102.09537] for all $\tau$ for $SU(N)$ gauge group; we
derive and elucidate its form.
  These results have ramifications for holography. We explain how
$\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle$, the ensemble average over the $\mathcal{N}=4$
supersymmetric conformal manifold with respect to the Zamolodchikov measure, is
cleanly isolated by the spectral decomposition. We prove that the large $N$
limit of $\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle$ equals the large $N$, large 't Hooft
coupling limit of $\mathcal{O}$. Holographically speaking,
$\langle\mathcal{O}\rangle = \mathcal{O}_{\rm sugra}$, its value in type IIB
supergravity on AdS$_5 \times$ S$^5$. This result, which extends to all orders
in $1/N$, embeds ensemble averaging into the traditional AdS/CFT paradigm. The
statistics of the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ ensemble exhibit both perturbative and
non-perturbative $1/N$ effects.

deriving the arbitrage free break-even inflation (BEI) curve for a
three-parameter specification of the two market prices of inflation risk.
Finally, we provide a number of auxiliary results regarding the dynamics of

experiments of the mission, will start its scientific investigation during the
superior solar conjunction (SSC) in March 2021 with a test of general
relativity (GR). Other solar conjunctions will follow during the cruise phase,
providing several opportunities to improve the results of the first experiment.
MORE radio tracking system allows to establish precise ranging and Doppler
measurements almost at all solar elongation angles (up to 7-8 solar radii),
thus providing an accurate measurement of the relativistic time delay and
frequency shift experienced by a radio signal during an SSC. The final
objective of the experiment is to place new limits to the accuracy of the GR as
a theory of gravity in the weak-field limit. As in all gravity experiments,
non-gravitational accelerations acting on the spacecraft are a major concern.
Because of the proximity to the Sun, the spacecraft will undergo severe solar
radiation pressure acceleration, and the effect of the random fluctuations of
the solar irradiance may become a significant source of spacecraft buffeting.
In this paper we address the problem of a realistic estimate of the outcome of
the SSC experiments of BepiColombo, by including in the dynamical model the
effects of random variations in the solar irradiance. We propose a numerical
method to mitigate the impact of the variable solar radiation pressure on the

lensing measurements of the Hubble parameter $H_0$. The first point concerns
the impact of weak lensing associated with different segments of the line of
sight. We show that external convergence terms associated with the lens-source
and observer-lens segments need to be included in cosmographic modeling, in
addition to the usual observer-source term, to avoid systematic bias in the
inferred value of $H_0$. Specifically, we show how an incomplete account of
some line of sight terms biases stellar kinematics as well as ray tracing
simulation methods to alleviate the mass sheet degeneracy. The second point
concerns the use of imaging data for multiple strongly-lensed sources in a
given system. We show that the mass sheet degeneracy is not fully resolved by
the availability of multiple sources: some degeneracy remains because of
differential external convergence between the different sources. Similarly,
differential external convergence also complicates the use of multiple sources
in addressing the approximate mass sheet degeneracy associated with a local
(""internal"") core component in lens galaxies. This internal-external degeneracy
is amplified by the non-monotonicity of the angular diameter distance as a
function of redshift. For a rough assessment of the weak lensing effects, we
provide estimates of external convergence using the nonlinear matter power
spectrum, paying attention to non-equal time correlators.

  from massive stars","Submitted to PASP",,"10.1088/1538-3873/ac604c",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Massive stars disrupt their natal molecular cloud material through radiative
and mechanical feedback processes. These processes have profound effects on the
evolution of interstellar matter in our Galaxy and throughout the Universe,
from the era of vigorous star formation at redshifts of 1-3 to the present day.
The dominant feedback processes can be probed by observations of the
Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) where the far-ultraviolet photons of massive
stars create warm regions of gas and dust in the neutral atomic and molecular
gas. PDR emission provides a unique tool to study in detail the physical and
chemical processes that are relevant for most of the mass in inter- and
circumstellar media including diffuse clouds, proto-planetary disks and
molecular cloud surfaces, globules, planetary nebulae, and star-forming
regions. PDR emission dominates the infrared (IR) spectra of star-forming
galaxies. Most of the Galactic and extragalactic observations obtained with the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will therefore arise in PDR emission. In this
paper we present an Early Release Science program using the MIRI, NIRSpec, and
NIRCam instruments dedicated to the observations of an emblematic and nearby
PDR: the Orion Bar. These early JWST observations will provide template
datasets designed to identify key PDR characteristics in JWST observations.
These data will serve to benchmark PDR models and extend them into the JWST
era. We also present the Science-Enabling products that we will provide to the
community. These template datasets and Science-Enabling products will guide the
preparation of future proposals on star-forming regions in our Galaxy and
beyond and will facilitate data analysis and interpretation of forthcoming JWST
observations.

intensively studied problem in scheduling, and a classic example for online
algorithm analysis with Graham's famous list scheduling algorithm dating back
to the 1960s. In this problem, jobs arrive over a list and upon an arrival, the
algorithm needs to assign the job to a machine. The goal is to minimize the
makespan, that is, the maximum machine load. In this paper, we consider the
variant with an additional cardinality constraint: The algorithm may assign at
most $k$ jobs to each machine where $k$ is part of the input. While the offline
(strongly NP-hard) variant of cardinality constrained scheduling is well
understood and an EPTAS exists here, no non-trivial results are known for the
online variant. We fill this gap by making a comprehensive study of various
different online models. First, we show that there is a constant competitive
algorithm for the problem and further, present a lower bound of $2$ on the
competitive ratio of any online algorithm. Motivated by the lower bound, we
consider a semi-online variant where upon arrival of a job of size $p$, we are
allowed to migrate jobs of total size at most a constant times $p$. This
constant is called the migration factor of the algorithm. Algorithms with small
migration factors are a common approach to bridge the performance of online
algorithms and offline algorithms. One can obtain algorithms with a constant
migration factor by rounding the size of each incoming job and then applying an
ordinal algorithm to the resulting rounded instance. With this in mind, we also
consider the framework of ordinal algorithms and characterize the competitive
ratio that can be achieved using the aforementioned approaches.

Most notably, ReLICv2 is the first unsupervised representation learning method
to consistently outperform the supervised baseline in a like-for-like

more robust and transferable representations that generalize better

metric capable of identifying artifact-free textures during a sampling process.
Further, in contrast to previous work on deep texture synthesis, our model is
designed and optimized to work with multi-layered texture representations,
enabling textures composed of multiple maps such as albedo, normals, etc. We
extensively test our design choices for the network architecture, loss function
and sampling parameters. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that our
approach outperforms previous methods and works for textures of different

pixel-wise annotations which are tedious to obtain manually. We study the
problem of self-training edge detection, leveraging the untapped wealth of
large-scale unlabeled image datasets. We design a self-supervised framework
with multi-layer regularization and self-teaching. In particular, we impose a
consistency regularization which enforces the outputs from each of the multiple
layers to be consistent for the input image and its perturbed counterpart. We
adopt L0-smoothing as the 'perturbation' to encourage edge prediction lying on
salient boundaries following the cluster assumption in self-supervised
learning. Meanwhile, the network is trained with multi-layer supervision by
pseudo labels which are initialized with Canny edges and then iteratively
refined by the network as the training proceeds. The regularization and
self-teaching together attain a good balance of precision and recall, leading
to a significant performance boost over supervised methods, with lightweight
refinement on the target dataset. Furthermore, our method demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generality. For example, it attains 4.8% improvement for ODS and
5.8% for OIS when tested on the unseen BIPED dataset, compared to the
state-of-the-art methods.

expression for the moment generating function with respect to a stationary

charge current fluctuations for a continuous range of timescales. The solution
exhibits several unorthodox features. Most prominently, on the timescale of
typical fluctuations the probability distribution of the integrated charge
current in a stationary ensemble without bias is distinctly non-Gaussian
despite diffusive behavior of dynamical charge susceptibility. While inducing a
charge imbalance is enough to recover Gaussian fluctuations, we find that
higher cumulants grow indefinitely in time with different exponents, implying
singular scaled cumulants. We associate this phenomenon with the lack of a
regularity condition on moment generating functions and the onset of a
dynamical critical point. In effect, the scaled cumulant generating function
does not, irrespectively of charge bias, represent a faithful generating
function of the scaled cumulants, yet the associated Legendre dual yields the
correct large-deviation rate function. Our findings hint at novel types of
dynamical universality classes in deterministic many-body systems.

manipulate the polarization of relativistic charged particle beams of leptons

single-shot interaction with a co-propagating moderate temporally asymmetric
(frequency-chirped or subcycle THz) laser pulse. Using semi-classical numerical
simulations, we find that in a temporally asymmetrical laser field, the spin
rotation of a particle can be determined from the flexibly controllable phase
retardation between its spin precession and momentum oscillation. An initial
polarization of a proton beam can be rotated to any desired orientation (e.g.,
from the common transverse to the more useful longitudinal polarization) with
extraordinary precision (better than 1\%) in tens of femtoseconds using a
feasible frequency-chirped laser pulse. Moreover, the beam qualities, in terms
of energy and angular divergence, can be significantly improved in the rotation
process. This method has potential applications in various areas involving
ultrafast spin manipulation, like laser-plasma, laser-nuclear and high-energy

the behavior of families of pivot rules of linear programs. We introduce
normalized-weight pivot rules which are fundamental for the following reasons:
First, they are memory-less, in the sense that the pivots are governed by local
information encoded by an arborescence. Second, many of the most used pivot
rules belong to that class, and we show this subclass is critical for
understanding the complexity of all pivot rules. Finally, normalized-weight
pivot rules can be parametrized in a natural continuous manner.
  We show the existence of two polytopes, the pivot rule polytopes and the
neighbotopes, that capture the behavior of normalized-weight pivot rules on
polytopes and linear programs. We explain their face structure in terms of
multi-arborescences. We compute upper bounds on the number of coherent
arborescences, that is, vertices of our polytopes.
  Beyond optimization, our constructions provide new perspectives on classical
geometric combinatorics. We introduce a normalized-weight pivot rule, we call
the max-slope pivot rule which generalizes the shadow-vertex pivot rule. The
corresponding pivot rule polytopes and neighbotopes refine monotone path
polytopes of Billera--Sturmfels. Moreover special cases of our polytopes yield
permutahedra, associahedra, and multiplihedra. For the greatest improvement
pivot rules we draw connections to sweep polytopes and polymatroids.

the sequence of power diagrams (radical partitions). The dual Voronoi diagram
is obtained as a limit of the sequence of weighted Delaunay partitions. The
problem is reduced to the construction of two dual convex polyhedra, inscribed
and superscribed around a circular paraboloid, as a limit of the sequence of
pairs of general dual convex polyhedra. The sequence of primal polyhedra should
converge to the superscribed polyhedron and the sequence of the dual polyhedra
converges to the inscribed polyhedron.
  We are interested in the case when the vertices of primal polyhedra can move
or merge together, i.e., no new faces are allowed for dual polyhedra. These
rules define the transformation of the set of initial spheres into the set of
Delaunay spheres using radius variation and sphere movement and elimination.
Existence theorems are still unavailable but we suggest a functional measuring
the deviation of the convex polyhedron from the one inscribed into the
paraboloid. It is the discrete Dirichlet functional for the power function
which is a linear interpolant of the vertical distance of the dual vertices
from the paraboloid. The functional's absolute minimizer is attained on the
constant power field, meaning that the inscribed polyhedron can be obtained by
a simple translation. This formulation of the functional for the dual surface
is not quadratic since the unknowns are the vertices of the primal polyhedron,
hence, the transformation of the set of spheres into Delaunay spheres is not
unique.
  We concentrate on the experimental confirmation of the approach viability and
put aside mesh quality problems. The zero value of the gradient of the proposed
functional defines a manifold describing the evolution of Delaunay spheres.
Hence, Delaunay-Voronoi meshes can be optimized using the manifold as a
constraint.

an attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system.
However, the coordinate transformation back to the original attractor is
typically unknown, and learning the dynamics in the embedding space has
remained an open challenge for decades. Here, we design a custom deep
autoencoder network to learn a coordinate transformation from the delay
embedded space into a new space where it is possible to represent the dynamics
in a sparse, closed form. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz,
R\""ossler, and Lotka-Volterra systems, learning dynamics from a single

a single scalar variable extracted from a video of a chaotic waterwheel

experimentally proved by different methods, including electrical resistance,
magnetic susceptibility, optical infrared, and nuclear resonant scattering
measurements. The crystal structures of superconducting phases were determined
by X-ray diffraction. Numerous electrical transport measurements demonstrate
the typical behaviour of a conventional phonon-mediated superconductor: zero
resistance below Tc, the shift of Tc to lower temperatures under external
magnetic fields, and pronounced isotope effect. Remarkably, the results are in
good agreement with the theoretical predictions, which describe
superconductivity in hydrides within the framework of the conventional BCS
theory. However, despite this acknowledgment, experimental evidence for the
superconducting state in these compounds has recently been treated with
criticism [3, 4], which apparently stems from misunderstanding and
misinterpretation of complicated experiments performed under very high
pressures. Here, we describe in greater detail the experiments revealing
high-temperature superconductivity in hydrides under high pressures. We show
that the arguments against superconductivity [3, 4] can be either refuted or

that are PT-symmetric, that is they are left invariant under a simultaneous
parity transformation (P) and time-reversal (T). I will explain how generalised
versions of this antilinear symmetry can be utilised to explain that these type
of systems possess real eigenvalue spectra in parts of their parameter spaces
and how to set up a consistent quantum mechanical framework for them that
enables a unitary time-evolution. In the second part I will explain how to
extend this framework to explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian systems and
report in particular on recent progress made in this context. I will explain
how to construct the essential key quantity in this framework, the
time-dependent Dyson map and metric and solutions to the time-dependent
Schr\""odinger equation, in an algebraic fashion, using time-dependent Darboux
transformations, utilising Lewis-Riesenfeld invariants, point transformations
and some approximation methods. I comment on the ambiguities of this metric and
demonstrate that this can even lead to infinite series of metric operators. I
conclude with some applications to PT-symmetrically coupled oscillators,
demonstrate the equivalence of the time-dependent double wells and unstable
anharmonic oscillators and show how the unphysical PT$-symmetrically broken
regions in the parameter space for the time-independent theory becomes physical
in the explicitly time-dependent systems. I discuss how this leads to a
prolongation of the otherwise rapidly decaying von Neumann entropy. The
so-called sudden death of the entropy is stopped at a finite value.

internal structure, which makes them ideal building blocks to explore exotic
quantum matter, implement novel quantum information schemes, or test
fundamental symmetries of nature. Realizing their full potential requires
cooling interacting molecular gases deeply into the quantum degenerate regime.
However, the complexity of molecules which makes their collisions intrinsically
unstable at the short range, even for nonreactive molecules, has so far
prevented the cooling to quantum degeneracy in three dimensions. Here, we
demonstrate evaporative cooling of a three-dimensional gas of fermionic
sodium-potassium molecules to well below the Fermi temperature using microwave
shielding. The molecules are protected from reaching short range with a
repulsive barrier engineered by coupling rotational states with a blue-detuned
circularly polarized microwave. The microwave dressing induces strong tunable
dipolar interactions between the molecules, leading to high elastic collision
rates that can exceed the inelastic ones by at least a factor of 460. This
large elastic-to-inelastic collision ratio allows us to cool the molecular gas
down to 21 nanokelvin, corresponding to 0.36 times the Fermi temperature. Such
unprecedentedly cold and dense samples of polar molecules open the path to the
exploration of novel many-body phenomena, such as the long-sought topological

  analysis of robust generalization for random features regression","87 pages, 13 pdf figures",,,,"cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Successful deep learning models often involve training neural network
architectures that contain more parameters than the number of training samples.
Such overparametrized models have been extensively studied in recent years, and
the virtues of overparametrization have been established from both the
statistical perspective, via the double-descent phenomenon, and the
computational perspective via the structural properties of the optimization
landscape.
  Despite the remarkable success of deep learning architectures in the
overparametrized regime, it is also well known that these models are highly
vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. Even when
adversarially trained, their performance on perturbed inputs (robust
generalization) is considerably worse than their best attainable performance on
benign inputs (standard generalization). It is thus imperative to understand
how overparametrization fundamentally affects robustness.
  In this paper, we will provide a precise characterization of the role of
overparametrization on robustness by focusing on random features regression
models (two-layer neural networks with random first layer weights). We consider
a regime where the sample size, the input dimension and the number of
parameters grow in proportion to each other, and derive an asymptotically exact
formula for the robust generalization error when the model is adversarially
trained. Our developed theory reveals the nontrivial effect of
overparametrization on robustness and indicates that for adversarially trained
random features models, high overparametrization can hurt robust
generalization.

variance. In this work, we focus on addressing the limitations arising from
this assumption by proposing a variance-sensitive class of models that operates

Meta-Dataset, mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet benchmarks. We further extend
this approach to a transductive learning setting, proposing Transductive CNAPS.
This transductive method combines a soft k-means parameter refinement procedure
with a two-step task encoder to achieve improved test-time classification
accuracy using unlabelled data. Transductive CNAPS achieves state of the art

applying Clifford finite-depth generalized local unitary (gLU) transformation,
we can achieve all possible fermion-to-qubit mappings (up to the re-pairing of
Majorana fermions). In particular, we discover a new super-compact encoding
using 1.25 qubits per fermion on the square lattice, which is lower than any
method in the literature. We prove the existence of fermion-to-qubit mappings
with qubit-fermion ratios $r=1+ \frac{1}{2k}$ for positive integers $k$, where
the proof utilizes the trivialness of quantum cellular automata (QCA) in two
spatial dimensions. When the ratio approaches 1, the fermion-to-qubit mapping
reduces to the 1d Jordan-Wigner transformation along a certain path in the

prevent the user from circumventing these restrictions through modification or
reverse engineering of the AI system. Structured access is most effective when

the AI developer greater scope for controlling how the AI system is used, and
for protecting against unauthorized modifications to the system's design. This

poses one of the largest because it generates losses to the environment within
a computational system which cannot be recovered via error correction methods.
These methods require the assumption that the environmental interaction forces
the qubit state into some linear combination of qubit eigenstates. In reality,
the environment causes the qubit to enter into a mixed state where the original
is no longer recoverable. A promising solution to this problem bases the
computational states on the low lying energy excitations within topological
materials. The existence of these states is protected by a global parameter
within the Hamiltonian which prevents the computational states from coupling
locally and decohering. In this paper, the qubit is based on nonlocal,
topological Majorana fermions (MF), and the gate operations are generated by
swapping or braiding the positions of said MF. The algorithmic calculation for
such gate operations is well known, but, the opposite gates-to-braid
calculation is currently underdeveloped. Additionally, because one may choose
from a number of different possible qubit definitions, the resultant gate
operations from calculation to calculation appear different. Here, the
calculations for the two- and four-MF cases are recapitulated for the sake of
logical flow. This set of gates serves as the foundation for the understanding
and construction of the six-MF cases. Using these, a full characterization of
the system is made by completely generalizing the list of gates and
transformations between possible qubit definitions. A complete description of
this system is desirable and will hopefully serve future iterations of
topological qubits.

XMM-Newton ($\sim$350 ks) observations of NGC 1404, a massive elliptical galaxy
experiencing ram-pressure stripping of its hot atmosphere while infalling
toward the centre of the Fornax cluster, with the aim to derive abundances
through its hot gas extent. Importantly, we report the existence of a new
fitting bias - the ""double Fe bias"" - leading to an underestimate of the Fe
abundance when two thermal components cannot realistically model the complex
temperature structure present in the outer atmosphere of the galaxy.
Contrasting with the ''metal conundrum'' seen in clusters, the Fe and Mg masses
of NGC 1404 are measured 1-2 orders of magnitude below what stars and
supernovae could have reasonably produced and released. In addition, we note
the remarkable Solar abundance ratios of the galaxy's halo, different from its
stellar counterpart but similar to the chemical composition of the ICM of rich
clusters. Completing the clusters regime, all these findings provide additional
support toward a scenario of early enrichment, at play over two orders of

stellar bar. Their formation and dynamics have been widely studied both
numerically and observationally. Although numerical simulations in the
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological framework predict the formation of such stellar
components, there seems to be a tension between theoretical and observational
results. Simulated bars are typically larger in size and have slower pattern
speed than observed ones. We study the formation and evolution of barred
galaxies, using two $\Lambda$CDM zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations of the
CLUES project that follow the evolution of a cosmological Local Group-like
volume. We found that our simulated bars, at $z = 0$, are both shorter and
faster rotators than previous ones found in other studies on cosmological
simulations alleviating the tension mentioned above. These bars match the short
tail-end of the observed bar length distribution. In agreement with previous
numerical works, we find that bars form in those systems where the disc
self-gravity is dominant over the dark matter halo, making them unstable
against bar formation. Our bars developed in the last 3-4 Gyr until they
achieve their current length and strength; as bars grow, their lengths increase
while their rotation speeds decrease. Despite this slowdown, at redshift $z =
0$ their rotation speeds and size match well the observational data.

isotopologue lines to constrain CO excitation and chemistry, and therefrom the
local physical conditions of the gas. In this survey paper, we describe the
CLAWS observing and data reduction strategies. We map the J=1-0 and 2-1
transitions of the CO isotopologues $^{12}$CO,$^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O and
C$^{17}$O, as well as several supplementary lines within the 1 mm and 3 mm

kpc resolution. A total observation time of 149 h offers unprecedented
sensitivity. We use these data to explore several CO isotopologue line ratios
in detail, study their radial (and azimuthal) trends and investigate whether
changes in line ratios stem from changes in ISM properties such as gas
temperatures, densities or chemical abundances. For example, we find negative
radial trends for the $^{13}$CO}/$^{12}$CO, C$^{18}$O/$^{12}$CO and
C$^{18}$O/$^{13}$CO line ratios in their J=1-0 transitions. We also find
variations with local environment, such as higher $^{12}$CO(2-1)/(1-0) or
$^{13}$CO/$^{12}$CO(1-0) line ratios in interarm regions compared to spiral arm
regions. We propose that these aforementioned variations of CO line ratios are
most likely due to a variation of the optical depth, while abundance variations
due to selective nucleosynthesis on a galaxy-wide scale could also play a role.
We also study the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) using archival
JCMT $^{12}$CO(3-2) data and find a variation of the SLED shape with local
environmental parameters further underlying changes in optical depth, gas
temperatures or densities.

and gluons into charged hadrons, making them a key ingredient for jet
substructure measurements at hadron colliders, where track-based measurements
offer superior angular resolution. The first moment of the track function,
describing the average energy deposited in charged particles, is a simple and
well-studied object. However, measurements of higher-point correlations of
energy flow necessitate a characterization of fluctuations in the hadronization
process, described theoretically by higher moments of the track function. In
this paper we derive the structure of the renormalization group (RG) evolution
equations for track function moments. We show that energy conservation gives
rise to a shift symmetry that allows the evolution equations to be written in
terms of cumulants, $\kappa(N)$, and the difference between the first moment of
quark and gluon track functions, $\Delta$. The uniqueness of the first three
cumulants then fixes their all-order evolution to be DGLAP, up to corrections
involving powers of $\Delta$, that are numerically suppressed by an effective
order in the perturbative expansion for phenomenological track functions.
However, at the fourth cumulant and beyond there is non-trivial RG mixing into
products of cumulants such as $\kappa(4)$ into $\kappa(2)^2$. We analytically
compute the evolution equations up to the sixth moment at
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, and study the associated RG flows. These results
allow for the study of up to six-point correlations in energy flow using

detectors. Infalling dark matter that scatters within stars could lead to a
range of observational signatures, including stellar heating, black hole
formation, and modified heat transport. To make robust predictions for such
phenomena, it is necessary to calculate the scattering rate for dark matter
inside the star. As we show in this paper, for small enough momentum transfers,
this requires taking into account collective effects within the dense stellar
medium. These effects have been neglected in many previous treatments; we
demonstrate how to incorporate them systematically, and show that they can
parametrically enhance or suppress dark matter scattering rates depending on
how dark matter couples to the Standard Model. We show that, as a result,
collective effects can significantly modify the potential discovery or
exclusion reach for observations of compact objects such as white dwarfs and
neutron stars. While the effects are more pronounced for dark matter coupling
through a light mediator, we show that even for dark matter coupling via a
heavy mediator, scattering rates can differ by orders of magnitude from their
naive values for dark matter masses <~ 100 MeV. We also illustrate how
collective effects can be important for dark matter scattering in more dilute
media, such as the Solar core. Our results demonstrate the need to
systematically incorporate collective effects in a wide range of astroparticle

self-energies for a variety of different media, which are applicable to many
other processes of interest (such as particle production).

and specific star formation rate. We consider samples of quiescent
(star-forming) galaxies in the stellar mass range $2\times 10^{10}$ --
$10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ ($3\times 10^9$ -- $6\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). For
quiescent galaxies, the X-ray profiles are clearly extended throughout the
available mass range; however, the measured profile is likely biased high due
to projection effects, as these galaxies tend to live in dense and hot
environments. For the most massive star forming samples ($\geq10^{11}$
M$_\odot$), there is a hint of detection of extended emission. For star-forming
galaxies with $< 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ the X-ray stacked profiles are compatible
with unresolved sources and consistent with the expected emission from faint
Active Galactic Nuclei and X-ray binaries. We measure for the first time the
mean relation between average X-ray luminosity and stellar mass separately for
quiescent and star-forming galaxies. High-mass ($\geq 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$)
star-forming or quiescent galaxies follow the expected scaling of virialized
hot haloes, while lower mass star-forming galaxies show a less prominent
luminosity and a weaker dependence on stellar mass, consistent with empirical
models of the weak AGN population. When comparing our results with state-of-the
art numerical simulations, we find an overall consistency on large ($>80$ kpc)

scales, where brighter than observed compact cores are predicted. Simulations
also do not predict the clear differentiation that we observe between quiescent

on extensive Monte Carlo simulations of ALP production and decays, as well as
estimates of the detection efficiencies based on simplified detector

using the public code ALPINIST released together with this work. We illustrate
this approach by considering several ALP models with couplings to Standard

important example is a first-order phase transition in a spectator sector which
couples to the inflaton. Gravitational waves (GWs) from such a first-order
phase transition during inflation, an example of an instantaneous source, have
an oscillatory feature. In this work, we show that this feature is generic for
a source in an era of accelerated expansion. We also demonstrate that the shape
of the GW signal contains information about the evolution of the early universe
following the phase transition. In particular, the slope of the infrared part
of the GW spectrum is sensitive to the evolution of the Hubble parameter when
the GW modes reenter the horizon after inflation. The slope of the profile of
the intermediate oscillatory part and the ultraviolet part of the GW spectrum
depend on the evolution of the Hubble parameter when the modes exit horizon
during the inflation and when they reenter the horizon during the reheating.
The ultraviolet spectrum also depends on the details of the dynamics of the
phase transition. We consider the GW signal in several models of evolution
during and after inflation, and compare them with the minimal scenario of
quasi-de Sitter inflation followed by radiation domination after a fast
reheating, and demonstrate that the shape of the GW can be used to distinguish
them. In this way, the GW signal considered in this paper offers a powerful
probe to the dynamics of the early universe which is otherwise difficult to
explore directly through CMB, large scale structure, big bang nucleosynthesis
(BBN), and other well-studied cosmological observables.

a wireless network. As a wireless example, FL is applied to learn how to
classify wireless signals collected by clients (spectrum sensors) at different

coupled to curvature invariants are known to possess (monopole) scalar hair
while non-black-hole spacetimes (like neutron stars) do not. Therefore, as a
neutron star collapses to a black hole, scalar hair must grow until it settles
to the stationary black hole solution with (monopole) hair. In this paper, we
study this process in detail and show that the growth of scalar hair is tied to
the appearance and growth of the event horizon (before an apparent horizon
forms), which forces scalar modes that would otherwise (in the future) become
divergent to be radiated away. We prove this result rigorously in general first
for a large class of modified theories, and then we exemplify the results by
studying the temporal evolution of the scalar field in scalar Gauss-Bonnet
gravity in two backgrounds: (i) a collapsing Oppenheimer-Snyder background, and
(ii) a collapsing neutron star background. In case (i), we find an exact scalar
field solution analytically, while in case (ii) we solve for the temporal
evolution of the scalar field numerically, with both cases supporting the
conclusion presented above. Our results suggest that the emission of a burst of
scalar field radiation is a necessary condition for black hole formation in a
large class of modified theories of gravity.

functions without explicit coordination among transmitters, which can lead to
many packet collisions as the network scales. State-of-the-art work proposes
various approaches to deal with these collisions, but most functions only in
high signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) conditions and thus does not scale to
many scenarios where weak receptions are easily buried by stronger receptions
from nearby transmitters. In this paper, we take a fresh look at LoRa's
physical layer, revealing that its underlying linear chirp modulation
fundamentally limits the capacity and scalability of concurrentLoRa
transmissions. We show that by replacing linear chirps with their non-linear
counterparts, we can boost the capacity of concurrent LoRa transmissions and
empower the LoRa receiver to successfully receive weak transmissions in the
presence of strong colliding signals. Such a non-linear chirp design further
enables the receiver to demodulate fully aligned collision symbols - a case
where none of the existing approaches can deal with. We implement these ideas
in a holistic LoRaWAN stack based on the USRP N210 software-defined radio
platform. Our head-to-head comparison with two state-of-the-art research
systems and a standard LoRaWAN baseline demonstrates that CurvingLoRa improves
the network throughput by 1.6-7.6x while simultaneously sacrificing neither
power efficiency nor noise resilience. An open-source dataset and code will be

This article presents a novel machine-learning based approach to learn these

is followed since his paper read to the Royal Statistical Society in 1982.
Aitchison's logratio approach, which was proposed to solve the problematic
aspects of working with data with a fixed sum constraint, is summarized and
reappraised. It is maintained that the properties on which this approach was
originally built, the main one being subcompositional coherence, are not
required to be satisfied exactly -- quasi-coherence is sufficient, that is near
enough to being coherent for all practical purposes. This opens up the field to
using simpler data transformations, such as power transformations, that permit
zero values in the data. The additional property of exact isometry, which was
subsequently introduced and not in Aitchison's original conception, imposed the
use of isometric logratio transformations, but these are complicated and
problematic to interpret, involving ratios of geometric means. If this property
is regarded as important in certain analytical contexts, for example
unsupervised learning, it can be relaxed by showing that regular pairwise
logratios, as well as the alternative quasi-coherent transformations, can also
be quasi-isometric, meaning they are close enough to exact isometry for all
practical purposes. It is concluded that the isometric and related logratio
transformations such as pivot logratios are not a prerequisite for good
practice, although many authors insist on their obligatory use. This conclusion
is fully supported here by case studies in geochemistry and in genomics, where
the good performance is demonstrated of pairwise logratios, as originally

science and the accelerated expansion of bioinformatics and computational
biology have made them a core topic for both disciplines. The SARS-CoV-2
pandemic has made such problems more demanding with hundreds or thousands of
new genome variants discovered every week, because of constant mutations, and
there is a desperate need for fast and accurate analyses. The requirement for
computational tools for genomic analyses, such as sequence alignment, is very
important, although, in most cases the resources and computational power
required are enormous. The presented Multiple Genome Analytics Framework
combines data structures and algorithms, specifically built for text mining and
pattern detection, that can help to efficiently address several computational
biology and bioinformatics problems concurrently with minimal resources. A
single execution of advanced algorithms, with space and time complexity
O(nlogn), is enough to acquire knowledge on all repeated patterns that exist in
multiple genome sequences and this information can be used from other
meta-algorithms for further meta-analyses. The potential of the proposed
framework is demonstrated with the analysis of more than 300,000 SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences and the detection of all repeated patterns with length up to
60 nucleotides in these sequences. These results have been used to provide
answers to questions such as common patterns among all variants, sequence
alignment, palindromes and tandem repeats detection, different organism genome
comparisons, polymerase chain reaction primers detection, etc.

order to increase their security face significant challenges such as specific
hardware unavailability, Memory Protection Unit (MPU) limitations and a
significant lack of Direct Memory Access (DMA) support. Nevertheless, DMA is
fundamental for the power and performance requirements of embedded
applications. In this paper, we present D-Box, a systematic approach to enable
secure DMA operations for compartmentalization solutions of embedded
applications using real-time operating systems (RTOS). D-Box defines a
reference architecture and a workflow to protect DMA operations holistically.
It provides practical methods to harden the kernel and define capability-based
security policies for easy definition of DMA operations with strong security
properties. We implemented a D-Box prototype for the Cortex-M3/M4 on top of the
popular FreeRTOS-MPU (F-MPU). The D-Box procedures and a stricter security
model enabled DMA operations, yet it exposed 41 times less ROP
(return-orienting-programming) gadgets when compared with the standard F-MPU.
D-Box adds only a 2% processor overhead while reducing the power consumption of
peripheral operation benchmarks by 18.2%. The security properties and
performance of D-Box were tested and confirmed on a real-world case study of a
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) application.

valuable as tools for data exploration and scientific discovery. However,
unlike typical machine learning problems in which a single model is trained
once on a single large dataset, scientific workflows privilege learned features
that are reproducible, portable across labs, and capable of incrementally
adding new data. Ideally, methods used by different research groups should
produce comparable results, even without sharing fully trained models or entire
data sets. Here, we address this challenge by introducing the Rosetta VAE
(R-VAE), a method of distilling previously learned representations and
retraining new models to reproduce and build on prior results. The R-VAE uses
post hoc clustering over the latent space of a fully-trained model to identify
a small number of Rosetta Points (input, latent pairs) to serve as anchors for
training future models. An adjustable hyperparameter, $\rho$, balances fidelity
to the previously learned latent space against accommodation of new data. We
demonstrate that the R-VAE reconstructs data as well as the VAE and
$\beta$-VAE, outperforms both methods in recovery of a target latent space in a
sequential training setting, and dramatically increases consistency of the
learned representation across training runs.

assimilated producing a reduced order Pad\'e approximant (PA). While the

rational approximant produced by the algorithm reported here is determined by
the number of spurious poles eliminated. Spurious poles due to coefficient
noise/precision limitations are identified using an evidence-based filter
parameter applied to the singular values of a matrix comprised of the series
coefficients. The rational function poles are found directly by solving a
generalized eigenvalue problem defined by a matrix pencil. Spurious poles place
at the point of development, responsible in some algorithms for degeneracy, are
identified by their magnitudes. Residues are found by solving an overdetermined
linear matrix equation. The method is compared with the so-called Robust Pad\'e
Approximation (RPA) method and shown to be competitive on the problems studied.
By eliminating spurious poles, particularly in functions with branch points,

solutions to Einstein's equations, which describes approximately well the

$M$, radius $R$, and an energy density that varies quadratically with the
radial coordinate $r$. Recently, Jiang and Yagi proposed a modification of this
solution, the so-called modified Tolman VII (MTVII) solution, by introducing an
additional quartic term to the energy density radial profile. The MTVII
solution is an approximate solution to Einstein's equation, which includes a
new parameter $\alpha$ that allows the solution to have a better agreement with
the energy density profiles for realistic NSs. Here we consider the MTVII
solution, showing that for certain values of the parameter $\alpha$ and
compactness $\mathcal{C}$ this solution manifests a region of negative pressure
near the surface which leads to negative values of the tidal Love number. To
alleviate these drawbacks, we introduce an exact version of the MTVII solution
obtained by solving numerically Einstein's equations for the MTVII energy
density profile. As an application of our new exact MTVII (EMTVII) solution, we
calculate the tidal Love number and tidal deformability, as a function of

or correlated features, including centrally-distributed and clustered data.
Unsupervised learning based on Euclidean nearest-neighbors and more general
proximity-oriented data mining tasks like clustering, might therefore be
adversely affected by distance concentration for high-dimensional applications.
While considerable work has been done developing clustering algorithms with
reliable high-dimensional performance, the problem of cluster validation--of
determining the natural number of clusters in a dataset--has not been carefully
examined in high-dimensional problems. In this work we investigate how the
sensitivities of common Euclidean norm-based cluster validity indices scale

well-separated and noisy clusters, and find that the overwhelming majority of

short, asks if $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1,\dots, f_k$. In the
search version of this problem the task is to find a proof of this fact. The
IMP is a well-known fundamental problem with numerous applications, for
instance, it underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as
Nullstellensatz, Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. Although the IMP is
in general intractable, in many important cases it can be efficiently solved.
  Mastrolilli [SODA'19] initiated a systematic study of IMPs for ideals arising
from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), parameterized by constraint
languages, denoted IMP($\Gamma$). The ultimate goal of this line of research is
to classify all such IMPs accordingly to their complexity. Mastrolilli achieved
this goal for IMPs arising from CSP($\Gamma$) where $\Gamma$ is a Boolean
constraint language, while Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] advanced these results
to several cases of CSPs over finite domains. In this paper we consider IMPs
arising from CSPs over `affine' constraint languages, in which constraints are
subgroups (or their cosets) of direct products of Abelian groups. This kind of
CSPs include systems of linear equations and are considered one of the most
important types of tractable CSPs. Some special cases of the problem have been
considered before by Bharathi and Mastrolilli [MFCS'21] for linear equation
modulo 2, and by Bulatov and Rafiey [ArXiv'21] to systems of linear equations
over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime. Here we prove that if $\Gamma$ is an affine constraint
language then IMP($\Gamma$) is solvable in polynomial time assuming the input
polynomial has bounded degree.

dynamics of the system depends on the between- and within-species interactions:
pollination by insects increases plant reproduction rate but has a cost which
can increase plant death rate, depending on pollinators density. Pollinators
reproduction is increased by the resources harvested on plants. Each species is
characterized by a trait corresponding to its degree of generalism. This trait
determines the structure of the interactions graph and the quantity of
resources exchanged between species. Our model includes in particular nested or
modular networks. Deterministic approximations of the stochastic measure-valued
process by systems of ordinary differential equations or integro-differential
equations are established and studied, when the population is large or when the
graph is dense and can be replaced with a graphon. The long-time behaviors of
these limits are studied and central limit theorems are established to quantify
the difference between the discrete stochastic individual-based model and the

domains, whether in healthcare, to predict pathologies, or in the financial

machine learning is data utility. However, when it contains personal
information, full access may be restricted due to laws and regulations aiming
to protect individuals' privacy. Therefore, data owners must ensure that any
data shared guarantees such privacy. Removal or transformation of private
information (de-identification) are among the most common techniques.
Intuitively, one can anticipate that reducing detail or distorting information
would result in losses for model predictive performance. However, previous work
concerning classification tasks using de-identified data generally demonstrates
that predictive performance can be preserved in specific applications. In this
paper, we aim to evaluate the existence of a trade-off between data privacy and
predictive performance in classification tasks. We leverage a large set of
privacy-preserving techniques and learning algorithms to provide an assessment
of re-identification ability and the impact of transformed variants on
predictive performance. Unlike previous literature, we confirm that the higher
the level of privacy (lower re-identification risk), the higher the impact on
predictive performance, pointing towards clear evidence of a trade-off.

performance should be evaluated by the full code length, i.e. the length of the
encoded text plus the length of the codebook. We studied several alphabets for
compressing texts -- letters, n-grams of letters, syllables, words, and
phrases. If only sufficiently short texts are retained, an alphabet of letters
or two-grams of letters is optimal. For the majority of Project Gutenberg
texts, the best alphabet (the one that minimizes the full code length) is given
by syllables or words, depending on the representation of the codebook. Letter
3 and 4-grams, having on average comparable length to syllables/words, perform
noticeably worse than syllables or words. Word 2-grams also are never the best
alphabet, on the account of having a very large codebook. We also show that the
codebook representation is important -- switching from a naive representation
to a compact one significantly improves the matters for alphabets with large
number of symbols, most notably the words.
  Thus, meaning-expressing elements of the language (syllables or words)
provide the best compression alphabet.

yield distributions represents a major challenge for nuclear theory as it
involves the intricate competition between large-amplitude nuclear collective
motion and single-particle nucleonic motion.
  Purpose: A recently proposed approach to global modeling of fission fragment
distributions is extended to account for odd-even staggering in charge yields
and for neutron evaporation.
  Method: Fission trajectories are obtained within the density functional
theory framework, allowing for a microscopic determination of the most probable
fission prefragment configurations. Mass and charge yields distributions are
constructed by means of a statistical approach rooted in a microcanonical
ensemble.
  Result: We show that the proposed hybrid model can reproduce experimental
mass and charge fragment yields, including the odd-even staggering, for a wide
range of fissioning nuclei. Experimental isotopic yields can be described
within a simple neutron evaporation scheme. We also explore fission fragment
distributions of exotic neutron-rich and superheavy systems, and compare our
predictions with other state-of-the art global calculations.
  Conclusion: Our study suggests that the microscopic rearrangement of nucleons
into fission fragments occurs well before the scission, and that the subsequent
dynamics is mainly driven by the thermal excitations and bulk features of the
nuclear binding. The proposed simple hybrid approach is well suited for
large-scale calculations involving hundreds of fissioning nuclei.

the precise dN/d$z$ distribution of the reference sample to recover new
redshifts and assign them one-to-one to galaxies such that the original rank
order of redshifts is preserved. Preserving the rank order is motivated by the
fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density functions
with different means but equal standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering.
The process is repeated for sub-volumes surrounding each galaxy in the survey.
This results in every galaxy with an uncertain redshift being assigned multiple
""recovered"" redshifts from which a new redshift estimate can be determined. An
earlier paper applied SORT to a mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey at $z \lesssim$
0.2 and accurately recovered the two-point correlation function on scales
$\gtrsim$4 $h^{-1}$Mpc. In this paper, we test the performance of SORT in
surveys spanning the redshift range 0.75$<z<$2.25. We used two mock surveys
extracted from the Small MultiDark-Planck and Bolshoi-Planck N-body simulations
with dark matter haloes that were populated by the Santa Cruz semi-analytic
model. We find that SORT is able to improve redshift estimates and recover
distinctive large-scale features of the cosmic web. Further, it provides
unbiased estimates of the redshift-space two-point correlation function
$\xi(s)$ on scales $\gtrsim$2.5 $h^{-1}$Mpc, as well as local densities in
regions of average or higher density. This may allow improved understanding of
how galaxy properties relate to their local environments.

estimation scheme for compact binaries known as Rapid PE. Rapid PE parallelizes
parameter estimation by fixing the intrinsic parameters (such as the masses and
spins of the binary) to a grid around a search-identified intrinsic point and
by integrating over the extrinsic parameters via Monte Carlo sampling. The
original version of Rapid PE calculated an effective Fisher matrix to fix the
intrinsic parameters to an ellipsoidal grid. Here we use rectilinear gridding
in intrinsic space. The use of rectilinear intrinsic grids provides the option
to more easily include spin and allows for adaptive grid refinements to
mitigate search biases and map out the posterior more completely without
sacrificing sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that this parameter estimation
method produces reliable results for simulated gravitational-wave signals from
binary neutron star mergers.

control of quantum dynamics. Model-based methods for optimal control have been
shown to be highly effective when theory and experiment closely match.
Consequently, realizing high-fidelity quantum processes with model-based
control requires careful device characterization. In quantum processors based
on cold atoms, the Hamiltonian can be well-characterized. For superconducting
qubits operating at milli-Kelvin temperatures, the Hamiltonian is not as
well-characterized. Unaccounted for physics (i.e., mode discrepancy), coherent
disturbances, and increased noise compromise traditional model-based control.
This work introduces model predictive control (MPC) for quantum control
applications. MPC is a closed-loop optimization framework that (i) inherits a
natural degree of disturbance rejection by incorporating measurement feedback,
(ii) utilizes finite-horizon model-based optimizations to control complex
multi-input, multi-output dynamical systems under state and input constraints,
and (iii) is flexible enough to develop synergistically alongside other modern
control strategies. We show how MPC can be used to generate practical optimized
control sequences in representative examples of quantum state preparation.
Specifically, we demonstrate for a qubit, a weakly-anharmonic qubit, and a
system undergoing crosstalk, that MPC can realize successful model-based
control even when the model is inadequate. These examples showcase why MPC is
an important addition to the quantum engineering control suite.

effective coordination between the conventional utility-owned mechanical
devices and the smart residential photovoltaic (PV) inverters. Typically, a
central controller carries out a periodic optimization and sends setpoints to
the local controller of each device. However, instead of tracking centrally
dispatched setpoints, smart PV inverters can cooperate on a much faster
timescale to reach optimality within a PV inverter group. To accommodate such
PV inverter groups in the VVC architecture, this paper proposes a bi-level
optimization framework. The upper-level determines the setpoints of the
mechanical devices to minimize the network active power losses, while the
lower-level represents the coordinated actions that the inverters take for
their own objectives. The interactions between these two levels are captured in
the bi-level optimization, which is solved using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions. This framework fully exploits the capabilities of the different
types of voltage regulation devices and enables them to cooperatively optimize
their goals. Case studies on typical distribution networks with field-recorded
data demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.

facilitates the minimum quality-of-transmission (QoT) assured allocation
against physical layer impairments (PLIs) under any single link/shared risk
link group (SRLG) failure for static and dynamic traffic scenarios. In general,
the effect of PLIs on lightpath varies based on the location of failure of a
link as it introduces different active working and backup paths. To address
these issues in the design of SBPP EON, we formulate a mixed integer linear
programming (MILP) based robust optimization framework for static traffic with
the objective of minimizing overall fragmentation. In this process, we use the
efficient bitloading technique for spectrum allocation for the first time in
survivable EONs. In addition, we propose a novel SBPP-impairment aware

partition the sample space into many convex polytopes for prediction. However,
the parameterized way a neural network and other machine learning models use to
partition the space has imperfections, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., the compromised
interpretability for complex models, the inflexibility in decision boundary
construction due to the generic character of the model, and the risk of being
trapped into shortcut solutions. In contrast, although the non-parameterized
models can adorably avoid or downplay these issues, they are usually
insufficiently powerful either due to over-simplification or the failure to
accommodate the manifold structures of data. In this context, we first propose
a new type of machine learning models referred to as Manifoldron that directly
derives decision boundaries from data and partitions the space via manifold
structure discovery. Then, we systematically analyze the key characteristics of
the Manifoldron such as manifold characterization capability and its link to
neural networks. The experimental results on 4 synthetic examples, 20 public
benchmark datasets, and 1 real-world application demonstrate that the proposed
Manifoldron performs competitively compared to the mainstream machine learning

distribution (SED) fitting is a powerful method, but can suffer from various
systematics arising from model assumptions. Previously, such biases were mostly
studied in the context of individual galaxies. In this study, we investigate
potential biases arising from performing the SED fitting on the combined light
of two galaxies, as would be the case in post-merger systems. We use
GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC) of z<0.3 galaxies to identify 9,000
galaxy pairs that could eventually merge. For these we investigate if the
UV/optical SED fitting accurately determines the stellar mass and (specific)
star formation rate if the pair was unresolved (merged). The sum of the stellar
masses (and SFRs) of individual galaxies in the pair establishes the ground
truth for these quantities. For star forming galaxies no biases (<0.1 dex) are
found in the stellar mass, SFR, or sSFRs. Moderate systematics in SFR (~0.1
dex) are found for systems with an extreme contrast in dust content between the
two galaxies. We conclude that biases that would arise in the determination of
masses and SFRs of post-merger systems on account of the two original galaxies
having potentially very different star formation histories and different dust
properties are small and that the approach with simple two-component star
formation histories is adequate. The approach presented in this study, using
flux compositing with empirically determined ground truth, offers new
opportunities for testing the results of SED fitting in general.

increasingly discussed, because its central custodian mechanism or star-shaped

address these problems, Swarm Learning (SL) introduces a permissioned
blockchain to securely onboard members and dynamically elect the leader, which
allows performing DL in an extremely decentralized manner. Compared with
tremendous attention to SL, there are few empirical studies on SL or
blockchain-based decentralized FL, which provide comprehensive knowledge of
best practices and precautions of deploying SL in real-world scenarios.
Therefore, we conduct the first comprehensive study of SL to date, to fill the
knowledge gap between SL deployment and developers, as far as we are concerned.
In this paper, we conduct various experiments on 3 public datasets of 5
research questions, present interesting findings, quantitatively analyze the
reasons behind these findings, and provide developers and researchers with

promising solution to the cooling flow problem in cool-core clusters, though
how exactly the jet energy is transformed into heat is a subject of debate.
Dissipation of sound waves is considered as one of the possible heating
mechanisms; however, its relative contribution to heating remains unclear. To
estimate the energy budget for heating, we perform 3D hydrodynamic simulations
of AGN jet injections in a Perseus-like cluster and quantify the amount of
energy stored in the forms of weak shocks and waves. We find that, for a single
jet injection with typical parameters in cool-core clusters, $\sim9\%$ of the
total jet energy is stored in compressional waves (including both shocks and
waves). However, due to the destructive effects among randomly phased waves as
well as the dissipation of shock energies, in our simulations including
self-regulated AGN feedback, no more than $3\%$ of the total injected energy
goes into compressional waves. We further separate the energy contribution from
shocks and waves and find that, for a single outburst, the shocks can only
contribute to $\sim20-30\%$ of the total compressional energy in the inner
radii, and they dissipate very quickly as they travel outward. However, because
of the repeated generation of shocks by multiple AGN outbursts, in the
self-regulated case shocks completely dominate over sound waves in the inner
region and can still provide $\sim40-50\%$ of the total compressional energy
even at outer radii. Our results suggest that the production of sound waves is
not as efficient as what was found in previous single-outburst simulations, and
thus sound wave dissipation may be a subdominant source of heating in cool-core
clusters.

holes at high redshifts $z > 10$, which are expected to be seeds to evolve to
supermassive black holes until redshift $z \sim 7$. For an initial mass,
$M_{\rm BH, ini} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{3} M_{\odot}$ of a seed BH, we
definitely need the super-Eddington accretion, which can be applicable to both
astrophysical and primordial origins. Such an accretion disk inevitably emitted
high-energy photons which had heated the cosmological plasma of the
inter-galactic medium continuously from high redshifts. In this case, the
cosmic history of cosmological gas temperature is modified, by which the
absorption feature of the cosmological 21 cm lines is suppressed. By comparing
theoretical predictions of the 21cm line absorption with the observational data
at $z\sim17$, we obtain a cosmological upper bound on the mass-accretion rate
as a function of the seed BH masses. In order to realize $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^9
M_{\odot}$ at $z \sim 7$ by a continuous mass-accretion on to a seed BH, to be
consistent with the cosmological 21cm line absorption at $z \sim 17$, we
obtained an severe upper bound on the initial mass of the seed BH to be $M_{\rm
BH, ini} \lesssim 10^2 M_{\odot}$ ($M_{\rm BH, ini} \lesssim 10^6 M_{\odot}$)
when we assume a seed BH with its comoving number density $n_{\rm seed,0} \sim
10^{-3} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ ($n_{\rm seed,0} \sim 10^{-7} {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$). We also
discuss some implications for application to primordial black holes as the seed

lines (1394 and 1403 \AA\ ) are theoretically the same as the ratio of their
oscillator strengths, which is exactly 2. Here, we study the ratio of the
integrated intensity of the Si IV lines ($R=\int
I_{1394}(\lambda)\mathrm{d}\lambda/\int I_{1403}(\lambda)\mathrm{d}\lambda$)
and the ratio of intensity at each wavelength point
($r(\Delta\lambda)=I_{1394}(\Delta\lambda)/I_{1403}(\Delta\lambda)$) in two
solar flares observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. We find
that at flare ribbons, the ratio $R$ ranges from 1.8 to 2.3 and would generally
decrease when the ribbons sweep across the slit position. Besides, the
distribution of $r(\Delta\lambda)$ shows a descending trend from the blue wing
to the red wing. In loop cases, the Si IV line presents a wide profile with a
central reversal. The ratio $R$ deviates little from 2, but the ratio
$r(\Delta\lambda)$ can vary from 1.3 near the line center to greater than 2 in
the line wings. Hence we conclude that in flare conditions, the ratio
$r(\Delta\lambda)$ varies across the line, due to the variation of the opacity
at the line center and line wings. We notice that, although the ratio
$r(\Delta\lambda)$ could present a value which deviates from 2 as a result of
the opacity effect near the line center, the ratio $R$ is still close to 2.
Therefore, caution should be taken when using the ratio of the integrated

according to a given sentence query. Though respectable works have made decent
achievements in this task, they severely rely on abundant video-query paired
data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect in real-world scenarios.
In this paper, we explore whether a video grounding model can be learned
without any paired annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
first work trying to address TVG in an unsupervised setting. Considering there
is no paired supervision, we propose a novel Deep Semantic Clustering Network
(DSCNet) to leverage all semantic information from the whole query set to
compose the possible activity in each video for grounding. Specifically, we
first develop a language semantic mining module, which extracts implicit
semantic features from the whole query set. Then, these language semantic
features serve as the guidance to compose the activity in video via a
video-based semantic aggregation module. Finally, we utilize a foreground
attention branch to filter out the redundant background activities and refine
the grounding results. To validate the effectiveness of our DSCNet, we conduct
experiments on both ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets. The results
demonstrate that DSCNet achieves competitive performance, and even outperforms
most weakly-supervised approaches.

without any prior information on what defines each activity. Most methods
presented in human activity recognition are supervised, where there are labeled
inputs to train the system. In reality, it is difficult to label activities
data because of its huge volume and the variety of human activities. This paper
proposes an unsupervised framework to perform human activity discovery in 3D
skeleton sequences. First, an approach for data pre-processing is presented. In
this stage, important frames are selected based on kinetic energy. Next, the
displacement of joints, statistical displacements, angles, and orientation
features are extracted to represent the activities information. Since not all
extracted features have useful information, the dimension of features is
reduced using PCA. Most methods proposed for human activity discovery are not
fully unsupervised. They use pre-segmented videos before categorizing
activities. To deal with this, we have used a sliding time window to segment
the time series of activities with some overlapping. Then, activities are
discovered by our proposed Hybrid Particle swarm optimization (PSO) with
Gaussian Mutation and K-means (HPGMK) algorithm to provide diverse solutions.
PSO is used due to its straightforward idea and powerful global search
capability which can identify the ideal solution in a few iterations. Finally,
k-means is applied to the outcome centroids from each iteration of the PSO to
overcome the slow convergence rate of PSO. The experiment results on five
datasets show that the proposed framework has superior performance in
discovering activities compared to the other state-of-the-art methods and has
increased accuracy of at least 4% on average.

learning. For example, it often gets trapped into a local minimum in training,
and its prediction uncertainty is hard to be assessed. To address these issues,
we propose the so-called kernel-expanded stochastic neural network (K-StoNet)
model, which incorporates support vector regression (SVR) as the first hidden
layer and reformulates the neural network as a latent variable model. The
former maps the input vector into an infinite dimensional feature space via a
radial basis function (RBF) kernel, ensuring absence of local minima on its
training loss surface. The latter breaks the high-dimensional nonconvex neural
network training problem into a series of low-dimensional convex optimization
problems, and enables its prediction uncertainty easily assessed. The K-StoNet
can be easily trained using the imputation-regularized optimization (IRO)
algorithm. Compared to traditional deep neural networks, K-StoNet possesses a
theoretical guarantee to asymptotically converge to the global optimum and
enables the prediction uncertainty easily assessed. The performances of the new
model in training, prediction and uncertainty quantification are illustrated by
simulated and real data examples.

collaborative task of laundry sorting. All three experiments took place in the

They have led to many essential applications for noise control, biomedical

acoustic sensors and acoustic lasers. Here, we theoretically propose and
experimentally demonstrate a new class of supercavity resonances in a coupled
acoustic resonators system, arising from the merged bound states in the
continuum (BICs) in geometry space. We demonstrate their topological origin by
explicitly calculating their topological charges before and after BIC merging,
accompanied by charges annihilation. Comparing with other types of BICs, they
are robust to the perturbation brought by fabrication imperfection. Moreover,
we found that such supercavity modes can be linked with the Friedrich-Wintgen
BICs supported by an entire rectangular (cuboid) resonator sandwiched between
two rectangular (or circular) waveguides, and thus more supercavity modes are
constructed. Then, we fabricate these coupled resonators and experimentally
confirm such a unique phenomenon: moving, merging, and vanishing of BICs by
measuring their reflection spectra, which show good agreement with the
numerical simulation and theoretical prediction of mode evolution. Finally,
given the similar wave nature of acoustic and electromagnetic waves, such
merged BICs also can be constructed in a coupled photonic resonator system. Our
results may find exciting applications in acoustic and photonics, such as

user-specific inter-item relationships among item candidates by seamlessly
accommodating the learned latent user intentions via IDM. As such, one can not

advantages, both theoretical prediction and experimental identification of weak
topological insulators remain scarce. Here, based on first-principles

we show that even in the absence of any specific form of active stresses
associated with self-propulsion, mesoscopic fluctuations in either
orientational alignment or hydrodynamics can independently result in flow
patterns around topological defects that resemble the ones observed in active
systems. Our simulations further show the possibility of extensile- and
contractile-like motion of fluctuation-induced positive half-integer
topological defects. Remarkably, isotropic stress fields also reproduce the
experimentally measured stress patterns around topological defects in
epithelia. Our findings further reveal that extensile- or contractile-like flow
and stress patterns around fluctuation-induced defects are governed by passive
elastic stresses and flow-aligning behavior of the nematics.

plays a part in biological evolution. Using a quantitative individual-based
method based on the stochastic process, we identify that enhancing the inherent
self-proliferation advantage of cooperators relative to defectors is a more
effective channel to promote the evolution of cooperation in range expansion
than weakening the benefit acquisition of defectors from cooperators. With this
self-proliferation advantage, cooperators can rapidly colonize virgin space and
establish spatial segregation more readily, which acts like a protective shield
to further promote the evolution of cooperation in return. We also show that
lower cell density and migration rate have a positive effect on the competition
of cooperators with defectors. Biological evolution is based on competition
between individuals and should therefore favor selfish behaviors. However, we
observe a counterintuitive phenomenon that the evolution of a population is
impeded by the fitness-enhancing chemotactic movement of individuals. This
highlights a conflict between the interests of the individual and the
population. The short-sighted selfish behavior of individuals may not be that
favored in the competition between populations. Such information provides
important implications for the handling of cooperation.

separate phase-field variables are introduced for tensile (mode I) and shear

scale parameters for mode I and mode II cracks. In contrast to the classic
two-field mixed-mode approaches it can thus account for different tensile and
shear strength of rock. The two phase-field equations are implicitly coupled
through the degradation of the material in the elastic equation, and the three
fields are solved using a staggered iteration scheme. For its validation, the
three-field model is calibrated for two types of rock, Solnhofen Limestone and
Pfraundorfer Dolostone. To this end, double-edge notched Brazilian disk (DNBD)
tests are performed to determine the mode II fracture toughness. The numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed phase-field model is able to reproduce
the different crack patterns observed in the DNBD tests. A final example of a

Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) space mission. For several of
them, these new data reveal previously unobserved variability, such as tidally
perturbed pulsations in close binary stars. Aims. Using newly detected
gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsations in V456 Cyg, we aim to determine the global
stellar properties of this short-period eclipsing binary and evaluate the
interaction between these pulsations and the tides. Methods. We model the
binary orbit and determine the physical properties of the component stars using
the TESS photometry and published spectroscopy. We then measure the pulsation
frequencies from the residuals of the light curve fit using iterative
prewhitening, and analyse them to determine the global asteroseismic stellar
parameters. We evaluate the pulsation parameters as a function of the orbital
phase. Results. We find that the pulsations belong to the secondary component
of V456 Cyg and that this star likely has a uniform radial rotation profile,
synchronous ($\nu_{\rm rot} = 1.113(14) \rm d^{-1}$) with the binary orbit
($\nu_{\rm orb} = 1.122091(8) \rm d^{-1}$). The observed g modes are amplified
by almost a factor three in the stellar hemisphere facing the primary. We
present evidence that this is caused by tidal perturbation of the pulsations,
with the mode coupling being strongly affected. Conclusions. V456 Cyg is only

is proposed to detect and categorize brain tumors in magnetic resonance images

classifiers (DBF-EC) scheme is proposed to detect tumor MRI images from healthy
individuals effectively. The deep boosted feature space is achieved through the
customized and well-performing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and
consequently, fed into the ensemble of machine learning (ML) classifiers. While
in the second phase, a new hybrid features fusion-based brain tumor
classification approach is proposed, comprised of dynamic-static feature and ML
classifier to categorize different tumor types. The dynamic features are
extracted from the proposed BRAIN-RENet CNN, which carefully learns
heteromorphic and inconsistent behavior of various tumors, while the static
features are extracted using HOG. The effectiveness of the proposed two-phase
brain tumor analysis framework is validated on two standard benchmark datasets;
collected from Kaggle and Figshare containing different types of tumor,
including glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and normal images. Experimental
results proved that the proposed DBF-EC detection scheme outperforms and

mean-reversion effects the optimal strategy and the resulting portfolio value
at the horizon. In particular, we are interested in knowing under which
assumptions and on which horizons, the risk-reward trade-off is so favourable
that the value of the portfolio is effectively bounded from below on the
horizon. In this case, we might think of the portfolio as providing a
stochastic excess return on top of a ""guarantee"" (the lower bound).
  Deriving optimal strategies is a well-known discipline in mathematical
finance. The modern approach is to derive and solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
(HJB) differential equation characterizing the strategy leading to highest
expected utility, for given utility function. However, for two reasons we
approach the problem differently in this work. First, we wish to find the
optimal strategy depending on time only, i.e., we do not allow for dependencies
on capital market state variables, nor the value of the portfolio itself. This
constraint characterizes the strategic allocation of long-term investors.
Second, to gain insights on the role of mean-reversion, we wish to identify the
entire family of extremal strategies, not only the optimal strategies. To
derive the strategies we employ methods from calculus of variations, rather
than the usual HJB approach.

bottom of the gap. If the renewal tail exponent is larger than one then the
random walk spends most of its time inside of the optimal gap but also performs
short outward excursions, for which we provide matching upper and lower bounds

atomistic simulations, yet no consensus has been reached on the factors that
determine their stability and growth. Proposed governing factors are
temperature-dependent differences in the bulk energy, biaxial strain induced
through point defects, and surface properties. In this work, we investigate the
thermodynamic stability of the 3C, 2H, 4H, and 6H polytypes with density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. The small differences of the bulk
energies between the polytypes can lead to intricate changes in their energetic
ordering depending on the computational method. Therefore, we employ and
compare various DFT-codes: VASP, CP2K, and FHI-aims; exchange-correlation
functionals: LDA, PBE, PBEsol, PW91, HSE06, SCAN, and RTPSS; and nine different
van der Waals (vdW) corrections. At $T=0$~K, 4H-SiC is marginally more stable
than 3C-SiC, and the stability further increases with temperature by including
entropic effects from lattice vibrations. Neither the most advanced vdW
corrections nor strain on the lattice have a significant effect on the relative
polytype stability. We further investigate the energies of the (0001) polytype
surfaces that are commonly exposed during epitaxial growth. For Si-terminated
surfaces, we find 3C-SiC to be significantly more stable than 4H-SiC. We
conclude that the difference in surface energy is likely the driving force for
3C-nucleation, whereas the difference in the bulk thermodynamic stability
slightly favors the 4H and 6H polytypes. In order to describe the polytype
stability during crystal growth correctly, it is thus crucial to take into
account both of these effects.

Curve Analysis is a tool intended to prevent selective reporting. Alas, when

assessments on some well-known open-domain chatbots and find that there are
severe mental health issues for all these chatbots. We consider that it is due

property is of interest. This paper presents detailed pressure-based finite
volume simulation of argon arc. In the modeling, the whole cathode region is
coupled to electromagnetic calculations to promise the free change of current
density at cathode surface. In numerical solutions, the upwind difference
scheme is chosen to promise the transport property of convective terms, and the
SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations) algorithm is used
to solve thermal pressure. By simulations of the free-burning argon arc, the
model shows good agreement with experiment. We observe an interesting
phenomenon that argon arc concentrates intensively in the high-frequency
alternating longitudinal magnetic field. Different from existing constricting
mechanisms, here arc achieves to be pinched through a continuous transition
between shrinking and expansion. The underlying mechanism is that via
collaborating with arc's motion inertia, the applied high-frequency alternating
magnetic field is able to effectively play a ""plasma trap"" role, which leads
the arc plasma to be imprisoned into a narrower space. This may provide a new
approach to constrict arc.

underwent more intense star-forming activity in the past, and now its star
formation is in the low state. The sub-arcsecond VLA images resolve six

rigidified by applying external strain. Recently, an analytical formalism has
been developed to predict the mechanical network properties close to this

Delaunay, Voronoi, and honeycomb networks. The analytical predictions further
imply that the shear modulus $G$ scales linearly with isotropic stress $T$

numerical studies suggesting an exponent between $G$ and $T$ that is smaller
than one for some network classes. Using increased numerical precision and

that our results are not or only weakly affected by finite-size effects,

Consequently, geometric visual localization methods have become more accurate
in time. However, these methods still suffer from significant loss and
divergence in challenging environments, such as a room full of moving people.
Scientists started using deep neural networks (DNNs) to mitigate this problem.
The main idea behind using DNNs is to better understand challenging aspects of
the data and overcome complex conditions such as the movement of a dynamic
object in front of the camera that covers the full view of the camera, extreme
lighting conditions, and high speed of the camera. Prior end-to-end DNN methods
have overcome some of these challenges. However, no general and robust
framework is available to overcome all challenges together. In this paper, we
have combined geometric and DNN-based methods to have the generality and speed

with the help of DNNs and deliver the most robust framework so far. To do so,
we have designed a framework based on Vins-Mono, and show that it is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results on TUM-Dynamic, TUM-VI, ADVIO, and EuRoC

on the outcome of the simulations, we give a comprehensive overview of the

contribution to $T$ depends only on the total diffusivity $D=D_1+D_2$, in sharp
contrast to the one-dimensional case. This contribution can be related to the
Wiener sausage generated by a fictitious Brownian particle with diffusivity
$D$. In two dimensions, the first subleading contribution to $T$ is found to
depend weakly on the ratio $D_1/D_2$. We also investigate the slow-diffusion

it can be used to quantify various Ig isotypes in capillary blood collected

Imposing the spectral boundary conditions, as well as the positiveness of
energy levels, lead to a correlation between the magnetic and rotation fields
such that strongly magnetized plasma can not rotate anymore. We solve the gap
equation at zero and finite temperature. At finite temperature and baryon
chemical potential $\mu_B$, we sketch the phase diagrams $T_c(\mu_B)$ and
$T_c(R\Omega)$ in different cases. As a result, we always observe
inverse-rotational catalysis mean to decrease $T_c$ by increasing $R\Omega$.
But the magnetic field has a more complex structure in the phase diagram. For
slowly rotating plasma, we find that $T_c$ decreases by increasing $eB$, while
in the fast rotating plasma we see that $T_c$ increases by increasing $eB$.
Also, we locate exactly the position of Critical End Point by solving the
equations of first and second derivatives of effective action with respect to
the order parameters, simultaneously.

this threat is converging. The botnets have attributes that make them an
excellent platform for malicious activities in IoT devices. These IoT devices
are used by organizations that need to both innovate and safeguard the personal

IoT devices have built-in sensors or actuators which can be exploited to
monitor or control the physical environment of the entities connected to them
thereby violating the fundamental concept of privacy-by-design of these
devices. In this paper, we design and describe a modular botnet framework for
IoT. Our framework is communication channel independent because it utilizes
various available communication channels for command and control of an IoT
device. The framework uses an enhanced centralized architecture associated with
a novel Domain Fluxing Technique. The proposed framework will provide insights
into how privacy in IoT devices can be incorporated at design time to check the
sensors and actuators in these devices against malicious exploitation
consequently preserving privacy. This paper includes design considerations,
command and control structures, characteristics, capabilities, intrusion, and

the data from the original study and an additional dataset of 31,960 issues

Deep-SE. The two additional RQs revealed that neither augmenting the training

the first efficient PoK for the syndrome decoding problem in 1993. Afterward,
different variations were proposed in order to reduce signature's size. In
practice, obtaining a smaller signature size relies on the interaction of two
main considerations: (i) the underlying protocol and its soundness error and
(ii) the type of optimizations which are compatible with a given protocol. Over
the years, different variations were proposed to improve the Stern scheme such
as the Veron scheme (with public key a noisy codeword rather than a syndrome),
the AGS scheme which is a 5-pass protocol with cheating probability
asymptotically equal to 1/2 and more recently the FJR approach which permits to
decrease the cheating probability to 1/N but induces a performance overhead.
Overall the length of the signature depends on a trade-off between: the scheme
in itself, the possible optimizations and the cost of the implementation. The
recent approaches which increase the cost of the implementation opens the door
to many different type of trade-offs. In this paper we propose three new
schemes and different trade-offs, which are all interesting in themselves,
since depending on potential future optimizations a scheme may eventually
become more efficient than another. All the schemes we propose use a trusted
helper: a first scheme permits to get a 1/2 cheating probability, a second
scheme permits to decrease the cheating probability in 1/N but with a different
approach than the recent FJR scheme and at last a third scheme propose a
Veron-like adaptation of the FJR scheme in which the public key is a noisy
codeword rather than a syndrome. We provide an extensive comparison table which

risk of MGF is no more than 1.54 times that of ridge. In particular, the

biomarkers are fully not clear. Taking lung cancer as a prototype case of
study. Through integrating clinical information into the transcripts expression
data, we systematically analyzed the effect of microRNA on diagnostic and
prognostic factors at deteriorative lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). After dimension
reduction, unsupervised hierarchical clustering was used to find the diagnostic
factors which represent the unique expression patterns of microRNA at various
patient's stages. In addition, we developed a classification framework, Light

that the ANN index can be too large to fit into memory, given the considerable

Document Representation, where the lightweight sparse embeddings are indexed
and standby in memory for coarse-grained candidate search, and the heavyweight
dense embeddings are hosted in disk for fine-grained post verification. For the
best of retrieval accuracy, a Progressive Optimization framework is designed.
The sparse embeddings are learned ahead for high-quality search of candidates.
Conditioned on the candidate distribution induced by the sparse embeddings, the
dense embeddings are continuously learned to optimize the discrimination of
ground-truth from the shortlisted candidates. Besides, two techniques: the
contrastive quantization and the locality-centric sampling are introduced for
the learning of sparse and dense embeddings, which substantially contribute to
their performances. Thanks to the above features, our method effectively
handles massive-scale EBR with strong advantages in accuracy: with up to +4.3%

  case",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  FAPbI3, as a typical hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite, has attracted
considerable interest due to its band gap suitable for visible light absorption
and good thermal stability. A barrier to the use of FAPbI3 in commercial,
stable devices is its unwanted black-to-yellow (non-perovskite to perovskite,
commonly known as delta-to-alpha) phase transition at around 300 K. The
intrinsic mechanisms of such phase transition are far from clear, being the
detailed structural description for the alpha-phase still missing. By combined
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, lattice dynamics analysis and DFT
molecular dynamics simulations, we assign the alpha-phase to the highly dynamic
tetragonal phase, with the high-symmetry cubic structure emerging as a
dynamically unstable maximum in the system potential energy landscape. We
demonstrate computationally that the diffraction-observed cubic structure is
the result of the averaging of different tetragonal distortions sampled in the
experimental detection time scale as a result of the enhanced FA dynamics,
instead of a static system of cubic symmetry. Further finite-temperature Gibbs
free energy calculations confirm that the delta-to-alpha transition should be
considered as a hexagonal-to-tetragonal transition in contrast to the previous
hexagonal-to-cubic assignment. More importantly, the simulations indicate that
the driving force of the process is the vibrational entropy difference rather
than the rotational entropy as previously proposed. These results point out the
dynamical nature of the alpha-phase, the importance of the overlooked
tetragonal structure, and the key role of the vibrational entropy in
perovskite-related phase transitions, the harnessing of which is critical for
successful uptake of ABX3 hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in commercial
applications.

took a step beyond that and calculated a small sample grid of theoretical
spectra integrated over the distorted surface of a sample rotating neutron star
seen by a distant observer at various inclination angles. We assumed parameters
like two dimensionless angular velocities $\bar{\Omega}^2=0.30$ and 0.60, the
effective temperature of a nonrotating star $T_{\rm eff}=2.20\times 10^7\,$K,
the logarithm of the surface gravity of a spherical star $\log(g)=14.40$ (cgs),
and inclination angles from $i=0^\circ$ to $i=90^\circ$ with step $\Delta
i=10^\circ$. We assumed that the atmosphere consists of a mixture of hydrogen
and helium with $M_{\rm H}=0.70$ and $M_{\rm He}=0.30$. At each point on the

parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log(g)$), and these monochromatic intensities
are next integrated over the whole surface to obtain the emergent spectrum. In
this paper, we compute for the first time theoretical spectra of the

consumption is a major concern for cloud providers in implementing the
scheduling strategy. The types and the number of virtual machines (VMs) used

workflow scheduling algorithms that take advantage of the structural properties
of the workflows. The first algorithm is called Structure-based Multi-objective
Workflow Scheduling with an Optimal instance type (SMWSO). It introduces a new
approach to determine the optimal instance type along with the optimal number

receptors by neurotransmitters (NTs) is governed by a stochastic
reaction-diffusion process. This randomness of synaptic MC contributes to the
randomness of the electrochemical downstream signal in the postsynaptic cell,
called postsynaptic membrane potential (PSP). Since the randomness of the PSP
is relevant for neural computation and learning, characterizing the statistics
of the PSP is critical. However, the statistical characterization of the
synaptic reaction-diffusion process is difficult because the reversible
bi-molecular reaction of NTs with receptors renders the system nonlinear.
Consequently, there is currently no model available which characterizes the
impact of the statistics of postsynaptic receptor activation on the PSP. In
this work, we propose a novel statistical model for the synaptic
reaction-diffusion process in terms of the chemical master equation (CME). We
further propose a novel numerical method which allows to compute the CME
efficiently and we use this method to characterize the statistics of the PSP.
Finally, we present results from stochastic particle-based computer simulations

governing synaptic transmission shape the autocovariance of the receptor
activation and, ultimately, the statistics of the PSP. Our results suggest that
the processing of the synaptic signal by the postsynaptic cell effectively
mitigates synaptic noise while the statistical characteristics of the synaptic

better understanding of the impact of the randomness of synaptic signal

Additional parameters are usually necessary. As a result, this paper proposed
an multi-indicator and multi-objective optimization algorithm based on

selection based on indicators performance and uses an adaptive parameter
strategy for parental selection without setting additional parameters. Then we
normalized the algorithm and compared its performance before and after
normalization, finding that normalization improved the algorithm's performance
significantly. We also analyzed how normalizing affected the indicator-based
algorithm and observed that the normalized $I_{\epsilon+}$ indicator is better
at finding extreme solutions and can reduce the influence of each objective's
different extent of contribution to the indicator due to its different scope.
However, it also has a preference for extreme solutions, which causes the
solution set to converge to the extremes. As a result, we give some suggestions
for normalization. Then, on the DTLZ and WFG problems, we conducted experiments

biomathematical model and a robust sample of aircrew rosters from the Brazilian
regular aviation. The fatigue outcomes derive from the software Sleep,
Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool
(SAFTE-FAST). The average minimum SAFTE-FAST effectiveness during critical
phases of flight decreases cubically with the number of shifts that elapse
totally or partially between mid-night and 6 a.m. within a 30-day period
($N_{NS}$). As a consequence, the relative fatigue risk increases by 23.3% (95%
CI, 20.4-26.2%) when increasing $N_{NS}$ from 1 to 13. The average maximum
equivalent wakefulness in critical phases also increases cubically with the
number of night shifts and exceeds 24 hours for rosters with $N_{NS}$ above 10.
The average fatigue hazard area in critical phases of flight varies
quadratically with the number of departures and landings within 2 and 6 a.m.
($N_{Wocl}$). These findings demonstrate that both $N_{NS}$ and $ N_{Wocl}$
should be considered as key performance indicators and be kept as low as

qualitative agreement with previous measurements of pilot errors. Tailored
analyses of the SAFTE-FAST inputs for afternoon naps before night shifts,

without afternoon naps, with one or two hours of commuting and with or without

(1) Background:
the many-body quantum structure of atomic nucleus, a complex system comprising
protons and neutrons (called nucleons collectively), has been studied largely
based on the idea of the quantum liquid (a la Landau), where nucleons are
quasiparticles moving in a (mean) potential well, with weak ""residual""
interactions between nucleons. The potential is rigid in general, although it
can be anisotropic. While this view was a good starting point, it is time to
look into kaleidoscopic aspects of the nuclear structure brought in by
underlying dynamics and nuclear forces. (2) Methods: exotic features as well as
classical issues are investigated from fresh viewpoints based on the shell
model and nucleon-nucleon interactions. The 70-year progress of the shell-model
approach, including effective nucleon-nucleon interactions, enables us to do
this. (3) Results: we go beyond the picture of the solid potential well by
activating the monopole interactions of the nuclear forces. This produces
notable consequences in key features such as the shell/magic structure, the
shape deformation, the dripline, etc. These consequences are understood with
emerging concepts such as shell evolution (incl. type-II), T-plot,
self-organization (for collective bands), triaxial-shape dominance, new
dripline mechanism, etc. The resulting predictions and analyses agree with
experiment. (4) Conclusion: atomic nuclei are surprisingly richer objects than
initially thought.

achieve good magnetic switching properties, one should choose a soft magnetic
material such as NiFe (permalloy); however, NiFe exhibits poor supercurrent
transmission in Josephson junctions. In this work we put thin layers of Ni on
either side of the NiFe and characterize the magnetic behavior and supercurrent
transmission properties of the Ni/NiFe/Ni trilayers as a function of Ni and
NiFe thicknesses. Using a Ni thickness of 0.4 nm, we find that the magnetic
switching behavior of the trilayers is not severely degraded relative to plain
NiFe, while the maximum supercurrent in the $\pi$-state of the trilayer
Josephson junctions is increased by a factor of four relative to that of NiFe

consider both spherically-symmetric solutions and complexed-valued aspherical

all three cases, the equations reduce to $1+1$ semi-linear wave equations. Our
proof relies on a theorem of Bambusi-Paleari for which the main assumption is
the existence of a seed solution, given by a non-degenerate zero of a

integral transformation of Jacobi polynomials. In the Yang-Mills case, the
original version of the theorem of Bambusi-Paleari is not applicable because
the non-linearity of smallest degree is nonresonant. The resonant terms are

While the system remains analytically tractable, the particle experiences the
nonlinearity of the surrounding velocity field. By exploiting the rotational
symmetry of the flow, we reduce the problem to that of a two-dimensional
dynamical system, whose fixed points and periodic orbits can be used to explain
the motion of the dumbbell. For all vortices in which the fluid angular
velocity decreases with radial distance, the center of mass of the dumbbell
follows a spirographic trajectory around the vortex center. This results from a
periodic oscillation in the radial direction combined with revolution around
the center. The shape of the trajectory depends strongly on the initial
position and orientation of the dumbbell, but the dynamics is qualitatively the
same irrespective of the form of the vortex. If the fluid angular velocity is
not monotonic, the spirographic motion is altered by the existence of transport
barriers, whose shape is now sensitive to the details of the vortex.

produced in several ways. In wind instruments, they can appear at low blowing
pressure when complex fingerings are used. Such multiphonics can be modeled by
the Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF). This top-down method regards musical
instruments as systems working with impulses originating from a generating
entity, travel through the instrument, are reflected at various positions, and
are exponentially damped. Eventually, impulses return to the generating entity
and retrigger or interact with subsequent impulses. Due to this straightforward
approach, the IPF can explain fundamental principles of complex dynamic
systems. While modeling wind instruments played with blowing pressures at the
threshold of tone onset, the IPF captures transitions between regular
periodicity at nominal pitch, bifurcations, and noise. This corresponds to
behavior found in wind instruments where multiphonics appear at the transition
between noise and regular musical note regimes. Using the IPF, complex
fingerings correspond to multiple reflection points at open finger holes with
different reflection strengths. Multiphonics can be modeled if reflection
points farther away show higher reflection strength and thus, disrupt periodic
motion. The IPF can also synthesize multiphonic sounds by concatenating typical
wind instrument waveforms at adjacent impulse time points.

  welcome!",,"10.1093/mnras/stac132",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the slope of the dust attenuation curve ($\delta$) is found to
correlate with effective dust attenuation ($A_V$) as obtained through spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting, it remains unknown how the fitting
degeneracies shape this relation. We examine the degeneracy effects by fitting
SEDs of a sample of local star-forming galaxies (SFGs) selected from the Galaxy
And Mass Assembly survey, in conjunction with mock galaxy SEDs of known
attenuation parameters. A well-designed declining starburst star formation
history is adopted to generate model SED templates with intrinsic UV slope
($\beta_0$) spanning over a reasonably wide range. The best-fitting $\beta_0$
for our sample SFGs shows a wide coverage, dramatically differing from the
limited range of $\beta_0<-2.2$ for a starburst of constant star formation. Our
results show that strong degeneracies between $\beta_0$, $\delta$, and $A_V$ in
the SED fitting induce systematic biases leading to a false $A_V$--$\delta$
correlation. Our simulation tests reveal that this relationship can be well
reproduced even when a flat $A_V$--$\delta$ relation is taken to build the
input model galaxy SEDs. The variations in best-fitting $\delta$ are dominated
by the fitting errors. We show that assuming a starburst with constant star
formation in SED fitting will result in a steeper attenuation curve, smaller
degeneracy errors, and a stronger $A_V$--$\delta$ relation. Our findings
confirm that the $A_V$--$\delta$ relation obtained through SED fitting is
likely driven by the systematic biases induced by the fitting degeneracies
between $\beta_0$, $\delta$, and $A_V$.

for characterizing collective topologically protected zero-energy Majorana
fermion excitations of such networks of localized Majorana modes. A key
ingredient in our work is the Gallai-Edmonds decomposition of a general graph,
which we use to obtain an alternate ``local'' proof of a ``global'' result of
Lov{\'a}sz and Anderson on the dimension of the topologically protected null
space of {\em real skew-symmetric} (or pure-imaginary hermitean) adjacency
matrices of general graphs. Our approach to Lov{\'a}sz and Anderson's result
constructs a maximally-localized basis for the said null-space from the
Gallai-Edmonds decomposition of the graph. Applied to the graph of the Majorana
network in question, this gives a method for characterizing basis-independent
properties of these collective topologically protected Majorana fermion
excitations, and relating these properties to the correlation function of
monomers in the ensemble of maximum matchings (maximally-packed dimer covers)
of the corresponding network graph. Our approach can also be used to identify
signatures of zero-energy excitations in systems modeled by a free-fermion
Hamiltonian with a hopping matrix of this type; an interesting example is
provided by vacancy-induced Curie tails in generalizations (on non-bipartite
lattices) of Kitaev's honeycomb model.

their post-measurement probability distributions over all possible measurements
(measured R\'enyi divergence), and maybe regularize these quantities over
multiple copies of the two states (regularized measured R\'enyi
$\alpha$-divergence). A key observation behind the theorem for the strong
converse exponent of asymptotic binary quantum state discrimination is that the
regularized measured R\'enyi $\alpha$-divergence coincides with the sandwiched
R\'enyi $\alpha$-divergence when $\alpha>1$. Moreover, it also follows from the
same theorem that to achieve this, it is sufficient to consider $2$-outcome
measurements (tests) for any number of copies (this is somewhat surprising, as
achieving the measured R\'enyi $\alpha$-divergence for $n$ copies might require
a number of measurement outcomes that diverges in $n$, in general). In view of
this, it seems natural to expect the same when $\alpha<1$; however, we show
that this is not the case. In fact, we show that even for commuting states
(classical case) the regularized quantity attainable using $2$-outcome
measurements is in general strictly smaller than the R\'enyi
$\alpha$-divergence (which is unique in the classical case). In the general
quantum case this shows that the above ""regularized test-measured"" R\'enyi
$\alpha$-divergence is not even a quantum extension of the classical R\'enyi

for controlling the state of a quantum system by modifying its boundary
conditions instead of relying on the action of external fields. The standard
approach to quantum control bases on the use of an external field to manipulate
the system. Some technological difficulties appear when controlling a quantum
system in this way, due to the complications of manipulating a system made of
few particles while maintaining the quantum correlations. As a consequence the
systems need to be kept at very low temperatures and the interactions have to
be performed very fast. The Quantum Control at the Boundary approach is
radically different to the standard one. Instead of seeking the control of the
quantum system by directly interacting with it through an external field, the
control is achieved by manipulating the boundary conditions of the system. The
spectrum of a quantum system, for instance an electron moving in a box, depends
on the boundary conditions imposed on it. Hence, a modification of such
boundary conditions modifies the state of the system allowing for its
manipulation and, eventually, its control. This kind of interaction is weaker,
which makes one to expect that it may help maintaining the quantum
correlations. For showing the viability of the Quantum Control at the Boundary
method, a family of boundary control systems on Quantum Circuits (a
generalization of quantum grahs) is introduced. Before being able to address
the problem of controllability, the problem of existence of solutions for the
Schr\""odinger equation with time-dependent boundary conditions is addressed.
The approximate controllability of the systems under study is proven using a
controllability result by T. Chambrion et al. (2009) and a stability result
which constitutes another original contribution of this dissertation.

high-speed videos, which transforms the imaging speed from the detector to mask
modulating and only needs a single measurement to capture multiple frames. The
algorithm to reconstruct high-speed frames from the measurement plays a vital
role in SCI. In this paper, we consider the promising reconstruction algorithm
framework, namely plug-and-play (PnP), which is flexible to the encoding
process comparing with other deep learning networks. One drawback of existing
PnP algorithms is that they use a pre-trained denoising network as a plugged
prior while the training data of the network might be different from the task
in real applications. Towards this end, in this work, we propose the online PnP
algorithm which can adaptively update the network's parameters within the PnP
iteration; this makes the denoising network more applicable to the desired data
in the SCI reconstruction. Furthermore, for color video imaging, RGB frames
need to be recovered from Bayer pattern or named demosaicing in the camera
pipeline. To address this challenge, we design a two-stage reconstruction
framework to optimize these two coupled ill-posed problems and introduce a deep
demosaicing prior specifically for video demosaicing which does not have much
past works instead of using single image demosaicing networks. Extensive
results on both simulation and real datasets verify the superiority of our

the widely-used wave transform, artifacts containing negative values arise
around regions with sharp transitions due to the application of band-limited
filters. In our approach, the decomposition is achieved by solving a modified,
non-linear version of the diffusion equation. This is inspired by the
anisotropic diffusion methods, which establish the link between image filtering
and partial differential equations. In our case, the artifact issue is
addressed where the positivity of the decomposed images is guaranteed. Our new
method is particularly suitable for signals which contain localized, non-linear
features, as typical of astronomical observations. It can be used to study the
multi-scale structures of astronomical maps quantitatively and should be useful
in observation-related tasks such as background removal. We thus propose a new

distribute among different components in the scale space, to describe maps. The

COVID-19. Models accounting either for age structure or the household structure
necessary to explicitly model many NPIs are commonly used in infectious disease
modelling, but models incorporating both levels of structure present
substantial computational and mathematical challenges due to their high
dimensionality. Here we present a modelling framework for the spread of an
epidemic that includes explicit representation of age structure and household
structure. Our model is formulated in terms of tractable systems of ordinary
differential equations for which we provide an open-source Python
implementation. Such tractability leads to significant benefits for model
calibration, exhaustive evaluation of possible parameter values, and
interpretability of results. We demonstrate the flexibility of our model
through four policy case studies, where we quantify the likely benefits of the
following measures which were either considered or implemented in the UK during
the current COVID-19 pandemic: control of within- and between-household mixing
through NPIs; formation of support bubbles during lockdown periods;
out-of-household isolation (OOHI); and temporary relaxation of NPIs during
holiday periods. Our ordinary differential equation formulation and associated
analysis demonstrate that multiple dimensions of risk stratification and social

discrete language to communicate and learn from each other, while machines use
continuous features (like vector, matrix, or tensor in deep neural networks) to
represent cognitive patterns. Discrete symbols are low-dimensional, decoupled,
and have strong reasoning ability, while continuous features are
high-dimensional, coupled, and have incredible abstracting capabilities. In
recent years, deep learning has developed the idea of continuous representation
to the extreme, using millions of parameters to achieve high accuracies.
Although this is reasonable from the statistical perspective, it has other
major problems like lacking interpretability, poor generalization, and is easy
to be attacked. Since both paradigms have strengths and weaknesses, a better
choice is to seek reconciliation. In this paper, we make an initial attempt
towards this direction. Specifically, we propose to combine symbolism and
connectionism principles by using neural networks to derive a discrete
representation. This process is highly similar to human language, which is a
natural combination of discrete symbols and neural systems, where the brain
processes continuous signals and represents intelligence via discrete language.
To mimic this functionality, we denote our approach as machine language. By
designing an interactive environment and task, we demonstrated that machines
could generate a spontaneous, flexible, and semantic language through
cooperation. Moreover, through experiments we show that discrete language
representation has several advantages compared with continuous feature
representation, from the aspects of interpretability, generalization, and
robustness.

phase-locked loops that ensure the angle estimation error goes to zero for
almost all initial conditions. Although well-known, for the sake of
completeness, we also present a PI controller with feedforward action that
ensures the converter currents converge to an arbitrary desired value.
Relevance of the theoretical results and their robustness to variation of the
grid parameters are thoroughly discussed and validated in the challenging
scenario of a converter connected to a grid with low short-circuit-ratio.

results of multiple studies regarding the same or closely related research
question. So-called meta-regression extends meta-analysis models by accounting
for studylevel covariates. Mixed-effects meta-regression models provide a
powerful tool for evidence synthesis, by appropriately accounting for
betweem-study heterogeneity. In fact, modelling the study effect in terms of
random effects and moderators not only allows to examine the impact of the
moderators, but often leads to more accurate estimates of the involved
parameters. Nevertheless, due to the often small number of studies on a
specific research topic, interactions are often neglected in meta-regression.
In this work, we consider the research questions (i) how moderator interactions
influence inference in mixed-effects meta-regression models and (ii) whether
some inference methods are more reliable than others. Here, we review robust
methods for confidence intervals in meta-regression models including
interaction effects. These methods are based on the application of robust
sandwich estimators for estimating the variance-covariance matrix of the vector
of model coefficients. Furthermore, we compare different versions of these
robust estimators in an extensive simulation study. We thereby investigate
coverage and length of seven different confidence intervals under varying
conditions. We conclude with some practical recommendations.

few percent of the stars, contrary to what is observed on the Sun. Our
objective is to characterise these relationships in more detail using
complementary criteria, and to constrain the properties of filaments and plages
that are necessary to explain the observations. We analysed the average level
and variability of the H$\alpha$ and Ca II emission for 441 F-G-K stars, paying
particular attention to their (anti-)correlations on both short and long
timescales. We also computed synthetic H$\alpha$ and Ca II time-series for
different assumptions of plage and filament properties and compared them with
the observations. We were not able to find plage properties that, alone, are
sufficient to reproduce the observations at all timescales simultaneously, even
when allowing different H$\alpha$ and Ca II emission relationships for
different stars. We also specified the complex and surprising relationship
between the average activity levels of both indexes, in particular for
low-activity stars.We conclude that plages alone are unlikely to explain the
observed variety of relationships between Ca II and H$\alpha$ emission, and
that the presence of other phenomena like filaments may help to reconcile the
models with observations.

cosmic explosions. The structure and emission of such shocks is regulated by
copious production of electron-positron pairs inside the shock transition
layer. It has been pointed out recently that substantial abundance of positrons
inside the shock leads to a velocity separation of the different plasma
constituents, which is expected to induce a rapid growth of plasma
instabilities. In this paper, we study the hierarchy of plasma
microinstabilities growing in an electron-ion plasma loaded with pairs and
subject to a radiation force. Linear stability analysis indicates that such a
system is unstable to the growth of various plasma modes which ultimately
become dominated by a current filamentation instability driven by the relative
drift between the ions and the pairs. These results are validated by
particle-in-cell simulations that further probe the nonlinear regime of the
instabilities, and the pair-ion coupling in the microturbulent electromagnetic
field. Based on this analysis, we derive a reduced transport equation for the
particles via pitch angle scattering in the microturbulence and demonstrate
that it can couple the different species and lead to nonadiabatic compression
via a Joule-like heating. The heating of the pairs and, conceivably, the
formation of nonthermal distributions, arising from the microturbulence, can
affect the observed shock breakout signal in ways unaccounted for by current
single-fluid models.

a transition metal (TM) oxide that is both isostructural and isoelectronic to
cuprate superconductors -- has lead to renewed enthusiasm in the hope of
understanding the origin of unconventional superconductivity. Here, we
investigate the electron-removal states in infinite-layered Ni$^{1+}$ oxide,
NdNiO$_2$, which mimics hole-doping, with the state-of-the-art many-body
multireference quantum chemistry methods. From the analysis of the many-body
wavefunction, we find that the hole-doped $d^8$ ground state of NdNiO$_2$ is
very different from the $d^8$ ground state in isostructural cuprate analog
CaCuO$_2$, although the parent $d^9$ ground states are for the most part
identical. We show that the doped hole in NdNiO$_2$ mainly localizes on the Ni
$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital to form a closed-shell singlet, and this singlet
configuration contributes to $\sim$40% of the wavefunction. In contrast, in
CaCuO$_2$ the Zhang-Rice singlet configurations contribute to $\sim$65% of the
wavefunction. With the help of the quantum information concept of entanglement
entropy, we quantify the different types of electronic correlations in the
nickelate and cuprate compounds and find that the dynamic radial-type
correlations within the Ni $d$ manifold are persistent in hole-doped NdNiO$_2$.
As a result, the $d^8$ multiplet effects are stronger and the additional hole
foot-print is more three-dimensional in NdNiO$_2$. Our analysis shows that the
most commonly used three-band Hubbard model employed to express the doped
scenario in cuprates represents $\sim$90% of the $d^8$ wavefunction for

electromyography (EMG) data. These signals drive a virtual musculoskeletal
model in the Neurorobotics Platform (NRP), which we then use to evaluate
resulting joint torques. We use our framework to analyze raw EMG data collected
during an isometric knee extension study to identify synergies that drive a
musculoskeletal lower limb model. The resulting knee torques are used as a
reference for genetic algorithms (GA) to generate new simulated activation
patterns. On the platform the GA finds solutions that generate torques matching
those observed. Possible solutions include synergies that are similar to those
extracted from the human study. In addition, the GA finds activation patterns
that are different from the the biological ones while still producing the same
knee torque. The NRP forms a highly modular integrated simulation platform
allowing these in silico experiments. We argue that our framework allows for

have a large memory footprint. Currently, they contain ~4e9 data bins which
amount to ~17GB in 32bit floating point precision. Using iterative algorithms
to reconstruct such enormous TOF sinograms becomes increasingly challenging due
to the memory requirements and the computation time needed to evaluate the
forward model for every data bin. This is especially true for more advanced
optimization algorithms such as the SPDHG algorithm which allows for the use of
non-smooth priors using subsets with guaranteed convergence. SPDHG requires the
storage of additional sinograms in memory, which severely limits its
application to data sets from state-of-the-art TOF PET systems.
  Motivated by the generally sparse nature of the TOF sinograms, we propose and
analyze a new listmode (LM) extension of the SPDHG algorithm for reconstruction
of sparse data following a Poisson distribution. The new algorithm is evaluated
based on 2D and 3D simulations, and a real dataset acquired on a recent TOF
PET/CT system. The performance of the newly proposed LM SPDHG algorithm is
compared against the conventional sinogram SPDHG and the listmode EM-TV
algorithm.
  We show that the speed of convergence of LM-SPDHG is equivalent the original
SPDHG using binned data. However, we find that for a TOF PET system with 400ps
TOF resolution, LM-SPDHG reduces the required memory from ~56GB to 0.7GB for a
short dynamic frame with 1e7 counts and to 12.4GB for a long static acquisition
with 5e8 counts.
  In contrast to SPDHG, the reduced memory requirements of LM-SPDHG enable a
pure GPU implementation on state-of-the-art GPUs which will substantially
accelerate reconstruction times. This in turn will allow the application of
LM-SPDHG in routine clinical practice where short reconstruction times are
crucial.

with a double-blackbody (BB) model throughout the campaign. The BB temperatures
remain constant at 0.46 and 1.2 keV. The areas and flux of each component
decreased by a factor of 6, initially through a steep decay trend lasting about
46 days followed by a shallow long-term one. The pulse shape in the same energy
range is initially complex, exhibiting three distinct peaks, yet with clear
continuous evolution throughout the outburst towards a simpler, single-pulse
shape. The rms pulsed fraction is high and increases from about 40% to 50%. We
find no dependence of pulse shape or fraction on energy. These results suggest
that multiple hotspots, possibly possessing temperature gradients, emerged at
outburst-onset, and shrank as the outburst decayed. We detect 84 faint bursts
with \nicer, having a strong preference for occurring close to the surface
emission pulse maximum the first time this phenomenon is detected in such a
large burst sample. This likely implies a very low altitude for the burst
emission region, and a triggering mechanism connected to the surface active
zone. Finally, our radio observations at several epochs and multiple

quantitatively address this puzzle, we have performed Monte Carlo simulation of
advection/diffusion of silicate particles in a turbulent disk, in the setting
based on pebble accretion model: pebbles consisting of many small amorphous
silicates embedded in icy mantle are formed in the disk outer region, silicate
particles are released at the snow line, crystalline silicate particles are
produced at the annealing line, the silicate particles diffused beyond the snow
line, and they eventually stick to drifting pebbles to come back to the snow
line. In a simple case without the sticking and with a steady pebble flux, we
show through the simulations and analytical arguments that crystalline
components in silicate materials beyond the snow line is robustly and uniformly
~ 5%. On the other hand, in a more realistic case with the sticking and with a
decaying pebble flux, the crystalline abundance is raised up to ~ 20-25%,
depending on the ratio of decay and diffusion timescales. This abundance is
consistent with the observations. In this investigation, we assume a simple
steady accretion disk. The simulations coupled with the disk evolution is

source electrons were previously thought to be accelerated to relativistic
velocities in the current sheet formed in the middle magnetosphere by the wind
opening magnetic field lines. However, a lack of dependence of radio luminosity
on the wind power, and a strong dependence on rotation, has recently challenged
this paradigm. We have collected all radio measurements of magnetic early-type
stars available in the literature. When constraints on the magnetic field
and/or the rotational period are not available, we have determined these using
previously unpublished spectropolarimetric and photometric data. The result is
the largest sample of magnetic stars with radio observations that has yet been
analyzed: 131 stars with rotational and magnetic constraints, of which 50 are
radio-bright. We confirm an obvious dependence of gyrosynchrotron radiation on
rotation, and furthermore find that accounting for rotation neatly separates
stars with and without detected radio emission. There is a close correlation
between H$\alpha$ emission strength and radio luminosity. These factors suggest
that radio emission may be explained by the same mechanism responsible for
H$\alpha$ emission from centrifugal magnetospheres, i.e. centrifugal breakout
(CBO), however, whereas the H$\alpha$-emitting magnetosphere probes the cool
plasma before breakout, radio emission is a consequence of electrons
accelerated in centrifugally-driven magnetic reconnection.

today. Based on forecast precipitation, topography, and pipe networks, flood
simulations can provide early warnings for areas and buildings at risk of
flooding. Basement windows, doors, and underground garage entrances are common
places where floodwater can flow into a building. Some buildings have been
prepared or designed considering the threat of flooding, but others have not.
Therefore, knowing the heights of these facade openings helps to identify
places that are more susceptible to water ingress. However, such data is not
yet readily available in most cities. Traditional surveying of the desired
targets may be used, but this is a very time-consuming and laborious process.
This research presents a new process for the extraction of windows and doors
from LiDAR mobile mapping data. Deep learning object detection models are
trained to identify these objects. Usually, this requires to provide large
amounts of manual annotations. In this paper, we mitigate this problem by
leveraging a rule-based method. In a first step, the rule-based method is used
to generate pseudo-labels. A semi-supervised learning strategy is then applied
with three different levels of supervision. The results show that using only
automatically generated pseudo-labels, the learning-based model outperforms the
rule-based approach by 14.6% in terms of F1-score. After five hours of human
supervision, it is possible to improve the model by another 6.2%. By comparing
the detected facade openings' heights with the predicted water levels from a
flood simulation model, a map can be produced which assigns per-building flood
risk levels. This information can be combined with flood forecasting to provide
a more targeted disaster prevention guide for the city's infrastructure and
residential buildings.

$\gtrsim10^{14}$~G, exhibit distinctive months-long outburst epochs during
which strong evolution of soft X-ray pulse profiles, along with nonthermal
magnetospheric emission components, is often observed. Using near-daily NICER
observations of the magnetar SGR 1830-0645 during the first 37 days of a recent
outburst decay, a pulse peak migration in phase is clearly observed,
transforming the pulse shape from an initially triple-peaked to a single-peaked
profile. Such peak merging has not been seen before for a magnetar. Our
high-resolution phase-resolved spectroscopic analysis reveals no significant
evolution of temperature despite the complex initial pulse shape. Yet the
inferred surface hot spots shrink during the peak migration and outburst decay.
We suggest two possible origins for this evolution. For internal heating of the
surface, tectonic motion of the crust may be its underlying cause. The inferred
speed of this crustal motion is $\lesssim100$~m~day$^{-1}$, constraining the
density of the driving region to $\rho\sim10^{10}$~g~cm$^{-3}$, at a depth of
$\sim200$~m. Alternatively, the hot spots could be heated by particle
bombardment from a twisted magnetosphere possessing flux tubes or ropes,
somewhat resembling solar coronal loops, that untwist and dissipate on the
30-40~day timescale. The peak migration may then be due to a combination of
field-line footpoint motion (necessarily driven by crustal motion) and evolving
surface radiation beaming. These novel dataset paints a vivid picture of the
dynamics associated with magnetar outbursts, yet it also highlights the need
for a more generic theoretical picture where magnetosphere and crust are
considered in tandem.

  We construct a new family of non-zonal steady solutions arbitrarily close in

  On the other hand, we prove that, under suitable conditions on the rotation
of the sphere, any stationary solution close enough to the rigid rotation zonal
flow $Y_1^0$ must itself be zonal, witnessing some sort of rigidity inherited
from the equation, the geometry of the sphere and the base flow. Nevertheless,
when the conditions on the rotation of the sphere fail, the set of solutions is
much richer and we are able to prove the existence of both explicit stationary

standard density-functional theory for two-dimensional anisotropic fluids,
based on two-body correlations, and an extension to incorporate three-body
correlations, fail to describe these symmetries. To explain the origin of
octatic symmetry we postulate strong particle clustering as a crucial
ingredient. We use Scaled Particle Theory to analyze four binary mixtures of
hard right triangles and squares, three of them being extreme models for a
one-component fluid, where right triangles can exist as monomeric entities
together with triangular dimers, square dimers or square tetramers. Phase
diagrams exhibit a rich phenomenology, with demixing and three-phase
coexistences. More important, under some circumstances the orientational
distribution function of triangles has equally high peaks at relative particle
angles 0, $\pi/2,$ and $\pi$, signalling fourfold, tetratic order, but also
secondary peaks located at $\pi/4$ and $3\pi/4$, a feature of eightfold,
octatic order. Also, we extend the binary mixture model to a quaternary mixture
consisting of four types of clusters: monomers, triangular and square dimers,
and square tetramers. This mixture is analyzed using Scaled Particle Theory
under the restriction of fixed cluster fractions. Apart from the obvious
tetratic phase promoted by tetramers, we found that, for certain cluster
compositions, the total orientational distribution function of monomers can

the linear regime, the stiffness modulations define a family of periodic and
quasiperiodic lattices whose bandgaps host topological edge states localized at
the boundaries of finite domains. With cubic nonlinearities, we show that edge
states whose eigenvalue branch remains within the gap as amplitude increases
remain localized, and therefore appear to be robust with respect to amplitude.
In contrast, edge states whose corresponding branch approaches the bulk bands
experience de-localization transitions. These transitions are predicted through
continuation studies on the linear eigenmodes as a function of amplitude, and
are confirmed by direct time domain simulations on finite lattices. Through our
predictions, we also observe a series of amplitude-induced localization
transitions as the bulk modes detach from the nonlinear bulk bands and become
discrete breathers that are localized in one or more regions of the domain.
Remarkably, the predicted transitions are independent of the size of the finite
lattice, and exist for both periodic and quasiperiodic lattices. These results
highlight the co-existence of topological edge states and discrete breathers in
nonlinear modulated lattices. Their interplay may be exploited for
amplitude-induced eigenstate transitions, for the assessment of the robustness
of localized states, and as a strategy to induce discrete breathers through
amplitude tuning.

biomarker for glioma patients. The gold standard of IDH mutation detection
requires tumour tissue obtained via invasive approaches and is usually
expensive. Recent advancement in radiogenomics provides a non-invasive approach
for predicting IDH mutation based on MRI. Meanwhile, tumor geometrics encompass
crucial information for tumour phenotyping. Here we propose a collaborative
learning framework that learns both tumor images and tumor geometrics using
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and graph neural networks (GNN),
respectively. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline
model of 3D-DenseNet121. Further, the collaborative learning model achieves
better performance than either the CNN or the GNN alone. The model
interpretation shows that the CNN and GNN could identify common and unique
regions of interest for IDH mutation prediction. In conclusion, collaborating
image and geometric learners provides a novel approach for predicting genotype

in binary black hole (BH) systems are typically small, which is consistent with
the predictions by the classical isolated binary evolution channel. In this
standard formation channel, the progenitor of the first-born BH is assumed to
have efficient angular momentum transport. The BH spins in high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs), however, have been found consistently to be extremely high.
In order to explain the high BH spins, the inefficient angular momentum
transport inside the BH progenitor is required. This requirement, however, is
incompatible with the current understanding of conventional efficient angular
momentum transport mechanism. We find that this tension can be highly
alleviated as long as the hypercritical accretion is allowed. We show that, for
a case study of Cygnus X-1, the hypercritical accretion cannot only be a good
solution for the inconsistent assumption upon the angular momentum transport
within massive stars, but match its other properties reported recently.

scalable self-supervised model for time series generation. ExtraMAE randomly
masks some patches of the original time series and learns temporal dynamics by
recovering the masked patches. Our approach has two core designs. First,
ExtraMAE is self-supervised. Supervision allows ExtraMAE to effectively and
efficiently capture the temporal dynamics of the original time series. Second,
ExtraMAE proposes an extrapolator to disentangle two jobs of the decoder:
recovering latent representations and mapping them back into the feature space.
These unique designs enable ExtraMAE to consistently and significantly
outperform state-of-the-art (SoTA) benchmarks in time series generation. The
lightweight architecture also makes ExtraMAE fast and scalable. ExtraMAE shows
outstanding behavior in various downstream tasks such as time series
classification, prediction, and imputation. As a self-supervised generative
model, ExtraMAE allows explicit management of the synthetic data. We hope this
paper will usher in a new era of time series generation with self-supervised

batteries. A simple and fast quasi-one-dimensional cell voltage model for such
devices is presented. The equilibrium cell potential is obtained from a complex
two-dimensional fit of data drawn from multiple studies of equilibrium cell
potential and rendered congruent with the phase diagram. Likewise, several
analytical and fit functions for the ohmic potential drop across the
electrolyte are provided for different battery geometries. Mass transport
overpotentials originating from the alloying of Li into Bi are modelled by
solving a diffusion equation, either analytically or numerically, and
accounting for the volume change of the positive electrode. The applicability
and limitations of the model are finally illustrated in three distinct
experimental settings.

  design of heating schedules",,"Ceramics International, 48 (2022) 2965-2987","10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.10.190",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Drying is the most critical process of the first heating cycle of monolithic
dense refractories, as the reduced permeability of the resulting microstructure
may lead to explosive spalling and mechanical damage associated with
dewatering. The first part of this review series pointed out the various drying
stages, the role of the binder components and the techniques that can be used
to follow the water release in as-cast refractory materials, when they are
exposed to heat. Although defining a suitable heating schedule is a great
challenge, some tools can be applied to minimize the spalling risks associated
with steam pressurization. In this context, this second review article points
out (i) the main drying agents and how they affect the resulting castables'
microstructure (organic fibers, metallic powders, permeability enhancing active
compounds, silica-based additives and chelating agents), and (ii) the effects
related to the procedures commonly applied during the designing of heating
routine (i.e., the role of the heating rate, ramp versus holding time), as well
as the influence of the castable's dimension on the overall drying behavior.
Considering the recent advances regarding the design of refractory formulations
and their processing, one may expect that incorporating suitable drying
additives into the prepared composition should lead to a suitable and safer
water release in such dense consolidated structures. Besides that, novel
engineering opportunities, such as the use of in-situ based experimental
techniques (i.e., neutron and X-ray tomography) to obtain more accurate data
and the development of numerical models, might help in simulating and
predicting the steam pressure developed in refractory systems during their
first heating.

  or Laguerre diagrams of points",,,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This article presents an algorithm to compute digital images of Voronoi,
Johnson-Mehl or Laguerre diagrams of a set of punctual sites, in a domain of a
Euclidean space of any dimension. The principle of the algorithm is, in a first
step, to investigate the voxels in balls centred around the sites, and, in a
second step, to process the voxels remaining outside the balls. The optimal
choice of ball radii can be determined analytically or numerically, which
allows a performance of the algorithm in $O(N_v \ln N_s$), where $N_v$ is the
total number of voxels of the domain and $N_s$ the number of sites of the
tessellation. Periodic and non-periodic boundary conditions are considered. A
major advantage of the algorithm is its simplicity which makes it very easy to
implement. This makes the algorithm suitable for creating high resolution
images of microstructures containing a large number of cells, in particular
when calculations using FFT-based homogenisation methods are then to be applied
to the simulated materials.

  through the analysis of 12-leads standard ECG","10 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is a heart's arrhythmia which, despite being often
asymptomatic, represents an important risk factor for stroke, therefore being
able to predict AF at the electrocardiogram exam, would be of great impact on
actively targeting patients at high risk. In the present work we use
Convolution Neural Networks to analyze ECG and predict Atrial Fibrillation
starting from realistic datasets, i.e. considering fewer ECG than other studies
and extending the maximal distance between ECG and AF diagnosis. We achieved
75.5% (0.75) AUC firstly increasing our dataset size by a shifting technique
and secondarily using the dilation parameter of the convolution neural network.
In addition we find that, contrarily to what is commonly used by clinicians
reporting AF at the exam, the most informative leads for the task of predicting
AF are D1 and avR. Similarly, we find that the most important frequencies to
check are in the range of 5-20 Hz. Finally, we develop a net able to manage at
the same time the electrocardiographic signal together with the electronic
health record, showing that integration between different sources of data is a
profitable path. In fact, the 2.8% gain of such net brings us to a 78.6% (std
0.77) AUC. In future works we will deepen both the integration of sources and
the reason why we claim avR is the most informative lead.

to guide the skipping of unnecessary horizontal and vertical partition modes.
With this guidance, a fast determination of block partitions is accordingly
achieved. Compared with VVC, our proposed method can save 41.64% (on average)

computers (HPC) to possess some level of heterogeneous architecture - typically
in the form of GPU accelerators. In some machines these are isolated within a
dedicated partition, whilst in others they are integral to all compute nodes -
often with multiple GPUs per node - and provide the majority of a machine's
compute performance. In light of this trend, it is becoming essential that
codes deployed on HPC are updated to execute on accelerator hardware. In this
paper we introduce a GPU implementation of the 3D blood flow simulation code
HemeLB that has been developed using CUDA C++. We demonstrate how taking
advantage of NVIDIA GPU hardware can achieve significant performance
improvements compared to the equivalent CPU only code on which it has been
built whilst retaining the excellent strong scaling characteristics that have
been repeatedly demonstrated by the CPU version. With HPC positioned on the
brink of the exascale era, we use HemeLB as a motivation to provide a
discussion on some of the challenges that many users will face when deploying
their own applications on upcoming exascale machines.
