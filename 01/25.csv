(LArTPCs) has typically been considered at the detector design stage, but
little attention has been given to its effects on calibration and particle
identification. We use a GEANT4-based simulation to study how diffusion impacts
these techniques, and give consideration to how this effect is simulated. We
find that diffusion can cause a drift-dependent bias to both the median and
Most Probable Value (MPV) of charge deposition per unit length distributions.
The bias is estimated to be ~2.5% (median) and ~5.0% (MPV) for typical maximum
drift times in currently running LArTPCs before adding detector specific
considerations such as electric field non-uniformities. This indicates that
these metrics should not be used for calibration without care, contrary to the
conventional wisdom. The impact of diffusion on the ability of LArTPCs to
separate muons and protons is small, and not expected to pose any problems in
future detectors. Diffusion may however be a significant source of systematic
uncertainty when separating particles of more similar masses (muons and pions,
kaons and protons). Separation of such populations may be improved by
implementation of a drift-time dependent particle identification.

eliminates multipacting (MP) induced quenches that are typically observed
frequently within the MP band field range. This suggests that plasma processing
could be employed in situ in CMs to mitigate both field emission and
multipacting, significantly decreasing the testing time of cryomodules, the

image reconstruction. It is called RISING, since it combines an early-stopped
Rapid Iterative Solver with a subsequent Iteration Network-based Gaining step.
So far, regularized iterative methods have widely been used for X-ray computed
tomography image reconstruction from low-sampled data, since they converge to a
sparse solution in a suitable domain, as upheld by the Compressed Sensing
theory. Unfortunately, their use is practically limited by their high
computational cost which imposes to perform only a few iterations in the
available time for clinical exams. Data-driven methods, using neural networks
to post-process a coarse and noisy image obtained from geometrical algorithms,
have been recently studied and appreciated for both their computational speed
and accurate reconstructions. However, there is no evidence, neither
theoretically nor numerically, that neural networks based algorithms solve the
mathematical inverse problem modeling the tomographic reconstruction process.
In our two-step approach, the first phase executes very few iterations of a
regularized model-based algorithm whereas the second step completes the missing
iterations by means of a neural network. The resulting hybrid deep-variational
framework preserves the convergence properties of the iterative method and, at
the same time, it exploits the computational speed and flexibility of a
data-driven approach. Experiments performed on a simulated and a real data set
confirm the numerical and visual accuracy of the reconstructed RISING images in
short computational times.

leading to datasets containing a large number of nucleotide sequences. The
focus is then on inferring the taxonomic placement of each of these sequences
by leveraging on existing databases containing reference sequences having known
taxa. This is highly challenging because i) sequencing is typically only
available for a relatively small region of the genome due to cost
considerations; ii) many of the sequences are from organisms that are either
unknown to science or for which there are no reference sequences available.
These issues can lead to substantial classification uncertainty, particularly
in inferring new taxa. To address these challenges, we propose a new class of
Bayesian nonparametric taxonomic classifiers, BayesANT, which use species
sampling model priors to allow new taxa to be discovered at each taxonomic
rank. Using a simple product multinomial likelihood with conjugate Dirichlet
priors at the lowest rank, a highly efficient algorithm is developed to provide
a probabilistic prediction of the taxa placement of each sequence at each rank.
BayesANT is shown to have excellent performance in real data, including when
many sequences in the test set belong to taxa unobserved in training.

one of the blocks, picked preferentially with respect to their areas, to divide
it either horizontally or vertically into two rectangles of which one of them
is removed with probability $q=1-p$. We find that the remaining number of
blocks and their mass varies with time as $t^{p}$ and $t^{-q}$ respectively.
Analytical solution shows that the dynamics of this process is governed by
infinitely many hidden conserved quantities each of which is a multifractal
measure with porous structure as it contains missing blocks of various
different sizes. The support where these measures are distributed is fractal
with fractal dimension $2p$ provided $0<p<1$. We find that if the remaining

a huge amount of subhalos possibly lighter than planets, depending on the
nature of dark matter. Predicting their abundance and distribution has
important implications for dark matter searches and searches for subhalos
themselves, as they could provide a decisive test of the CDM paradigm. A major
difficulty in subhalo population model building is to account for the
gravitational stripping induced by baryons, which strongly impact on the
overall dynamics inside galaxies. In this paper, we focus on these ""baryonic""
tides from analytical perspectives, summarizing previous work on galactic disk
shocking, and thoroughly revisiting the impact of individual encounters with
stars. For the latter, we go beyond the reference calculation of Gerhard and
Fall (1983) to deal with penetrative encounters, and provide new analytical
results. Based upon a full statistical analysis of subhalo energy change during
multiple stellar encounters possibly occurring during disk crossing, we show
that subhalos lighter than $\sim 1$~M$_\odot$ are very efficiently pruned by
stellar encounters. This modifies their mass function in a stellar environment.
In contrast, disk shocking is more efficient at pruning massive subhalos. In
short, if reasonably resilient, subhalos surviving disk crossing have lost all
their mass but an inner cuspy part, with a tidal mass function strongly
departing from the cosmological one. If fragile, stellar encounters make their
number density drop by an additional order of magnitude with respect to
disk-shocking effects only (e.g., at the solar position in the Milky Way). Our
results can be incorporated to any analytical or numerical subhalo population
model, as we show for illustration. This study complements those based on
cosmological simulations, which cannot resolve dark matter subhalos on such
small scales.

introduction to the necessary tools to understand the framework and elaborate
on some subtleties of the minimal coupling prescription between geometry and
matter in presence of torsion and nonmetricity. Then we dedicate the central
part of the thesis to study the structure of Ricci Based gravity (RBG)
theories, which will be of later use to understand generic properties of
metric-affine theories. We begin by analysing the structure of the RBG field
equations and nontrivial aspects of their solution space. We then analyse the
abrosption spectra of some spherically symmetric solutions. Then, we show that,
if the projective symmetry in these theories is explicitly broken, then there
arise ghost degrees of freedom, and we argue that this will be a generic
feature of metric-affine gravity theories. Having done this, we analyse
metricafine theories through the EFT lens, showing how the nonmetricity tkes a
particular form in generic theories where the symmetrised Ricci tensor appears
in the action beyond the Einstein-Hilbert term. This sources effective
interactions that we use to place tight constraints to these theories. In the
third part of the thesis we present a miscelanea of works which are not so
related to the structure of RBG theories. We begin by studying a model for
spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry, namely the bumblebee model, in the
metric-affine approach. In the following chapter we generalise a conformal
invariant definition of proper time given by Perlick to the case with general
nonmetricity. Finally, we present arguments that show that the recently
proposed D4EGB theory is not well defined in its original form. We finish with

graphene $p-n$ junction devices using simple ultraviolet photolithography,
thereby significantly reducing device processing time compared to that of
electron beam lithography typically used for obtaining sharp junctions. This
work presents measurements yielding nonconventional, fractional multiples of
the typical quantized Hall resistance at $\nu=2$ ($R_H\approx 12906 {\Omega}$)
that take the form: $\frac{a}{b}R_H$. Here, $a$ and $b$ have been observed to
take on values such 1, 2, 3, and 5 to form various coefficients of $R_H$.
Additionally, we provide a framework for exploring future device configurations
using the LTspice circuit simulator as a guide to understand the abundance of
available fractions one may be able to measure. These results support the
potential for drastically simplifying device processing time and may be used
for many other two-dimensional materials.

vision tasks for many years, recent experiments have shown that
Transformer-based models, most notably the Vision Transformer (ViT), may exceed
their performance in some settings. However, due to the quadratic runtime of
the self-attention layers in Transformers, ViTs require the use of patch
embeddings, which group together small regions of the image into single input
features, in order to be applied to larger image sizes. This raises a question:
Is the performance of ViTs due to the inherently-more-powerful Transformer
architecture, or is it at least partly due to using patches as the input
representation? In this paper, we present some evidence for the latter:
specifically, we propose the ConvMixer, an extremely simple model that is
similar in spirit to the ViT and the even-more-basic MLP-Mixer in that it
operates directly on patches as input, separates the mixing of spatial and
channel dimensions, and maintains equal size and resolution throughout the
network. In contrast, however, the ConvMixer uses only standard convolutions to
achieve the mixing steps. Despite its simplicity, we show that the ConvMixer
outperforms the ViT, MLP-Mixer, and some of their variants for similar
parameter counts and data set sizes, in addition to outperforming classical
vision models such as the ResNet. Our code is available at

the GRB-bright jet core, we find a peak flux variability on the order $<0.5$
dex through rotational orientation and $<1.3$ dex for the polar inclination. An
observed afterglow's peak flux can be used to infer the jet kinetic energy, and
where a top-hat jet is assumed, we find the range of inferred jet kinetic
energies for our various model afterglow lightcurves (with fixed model
parameters), covers $\sim 1/3$ of the observed short GRB population.
Additionally, we present an analytic jet structure function that includes
physically motivated parameter uncertainties due to variability through the

that are tuned to the modern Earth, and thus may be a source of uncertainty in
evaluating exoplanet climates. Here, we explore sensitivities to numerous
configuration and parameter selections, including a recently updated radiation
scheme, a different cloud and convection physics package, different cloud and

to our radiation scheme and the modification of cloud particle sizes have the

social mixing has affected illness spread. We estimated the basic reproduction

Optimal control for the problem has also been established quantitatively. The

and other living systems. This raises the question of whether the optimization
of mixing through the emergence of active turbulent motion in bacterial swarms
played a role in the evolution of bacterial shapes. Here, to address this
question, we solve the hydrodynamic equation for active nematics coupled with
an advection-diffusion equation for the nutrients. The latter models a
conserved activity field and mimics the conservation of nutrients in bacterial
swarms. At the interface between active and passive nematic phases, in addition
to diffusion, the activity is transported by interfacial flows and in turn
modifies them through active stresses. We find that the interfacial dispersion
of the conserved activity is subdiffusive due to the emergence of a barrier of
negative defects at the active-passive interface, which hinders the propagation
of the motile positive defects. Furthermore, we observe a non-monotonic
dependence of the generalized diffusion coefficient on the aligning parameter,
which is related to the shape of the particles. Our simulations suggest that
there is an optimal shape that maximizes the dispersion of conserved activity
at the active-passive nematic interface.

the channel, which induces a surface tension gradient on the free surface of
the fluid, leading to a surface flow towards the cold side. The flow pattern is
axially symmetric along the temperature gradient with an internal circulation
for a small temperature difference. This axially symmetric flow (ASF) becomes
unstable beyond a given temperature difference threshold, and subsequently,
symmetry-breaking flow, i.e., rotational oscillating waves or HTW, appears. For
the second system, Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) is experimentally studied
in the non-turbulent regime. When a thin film of liquid is heated, the
competing forces of viscosity and buoyancy give rise to convective
instabilities. This convective instability creates a spatio-temporal
non-uniform temperature distribution on the surface of the fluid film. The
surface temperature statistics are studied in both these systems as `order' and
`disorder' phase separates. Although the mechanisms that give rise to
convective instabilities are different in both cases, we find an agreement on
the macroscopic nature of the thermal distributions in these emergent
structures.

between dark energy and dark matter, provides a natural mechanism to alleviate
the coincidence problem and can also relieve the observational tensions under
the $\Lambda$CDM model. Previous studies have put constraints on IDE models by
observations of cosmic expansion history, cosmic microwave background and
large-scale structures. However, these data are not yet enough to distinguish
IDE models from $\Lambda$CDM effectively. Because the non-linear structure
formation contains rich cosmological information, it can provide additional
means to differentiate alternative models. In this paper, based on a set of
$N$-body simulations for IDE models, we investigate the formation histories and
properties of dark matter halos, and compare with their $\Lambda$CDM
counterparts. For the model with dark matter decaying into dark energy and the
parameters being the best-fit values from previous constraints, the structure
formation is markedly slowed down, and the halos have systematically lower
mass, looser internal structure, higher spin and anisotropy. This is
inconsistent with the observed structure formation, and thus this model can be
safely ruled out from the perspective of non-linear structure formation.
Moreover, we find that the ratio of halo concentrations between IDE and
$\Lambda$CDM counterparts depends sensitively on the interaction parameter and
is independent of halo mass. This can act as a powerful probe to constrain IDE
models. Our results concretely demonstrate that the interaction of the two dark
components can affect the halo formation considerably, and therefore the
constraints from non-linear structures are indispensable.

most previously proposed visually lossless compression techniques exploit
luminance (luma) masking including luma spatiotemporal masking, luma contrast

regard to the spectral sensitivity phenomenon of the HVS, the color channels of

These perceptual redundancies can be quantized via color channel-level
perceptual quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
visually lossless coding method named Spectral Perceptual Quantization

HVS spectral sensitivity-related color masking in addition to spatial masking

perceptually adjusts the Quantization Step Size (QStep) at the CB level if high

refinement schemes for solving linear systems $Ax=b$ have recently been
revisited and reanalyzed in the context of three or more precisions. These new
analyses show that under certain constraints on condition number, the LU
factorization of the matrix can be computed in low precision without affecting
the final accuracy. Another promising technique is GMRES-based iterative
refinement, which, in contrast to the standard approach, use GMRES
preconditioned by the low-precision triangular factors to solve for the
approximate solution update in each refinement step. This more accurate
solution method extends the range of problems which can be solved with a given
combination of precisions. However, in certain settings, GMRES may require too
many iterations per refinement step, making it potentially more expensive than
simply recomputing the LU factors in a higher precision.
  Krylov subspace recycling is a well-known technique for reusing information
across sequential invocations of a Krylov subspace method on systems with the
same or a slowly changing coefficient matrix. In this work, we incorporate the
idea of Krylov subspace recycling into a mixed precision GMRES-based iterative
refinement solver. The insight is that in each refinement step, we call
preconditioned GMRES on a linear system with the same coefficient matrix $A$,
with only the right-hand side changing. In this way, the GMRES solves in
subsequent refinement steps can be accelerated by recycling information
obtained from the first step. We perform extensive numerical experiments on
various random dense problems, Toeplitz problems (prolate matrices), and
problems from real applications, which confirm the benefits of the recycling
approach.

polynomial as well as multiple neural network potentials with different
architectures. For comparison, a corresponding family of potentials were also
trained on an expert-curated dataset for tungsten. The models trained to
entropy-optimized data exhibited vastly superior transferability compared to
the expert-curated models. Furthermore, while the models trained with heavy

Herein we demonstrate the development of both accurate and transferable ML
potentials using automated and data-driven approaches for generating large and

among the wide range of applications in the field of metamaterials. So far,
most efforts in invisibility science have been devoted to achieving practically
realizable cloak designs and to improving the effectiveness of these devices in
reducing their scattering cross-section (SCS), a scalar quantity accounting for
the total electromagnetic energy scattered by an object. In contrast, little
attention has been paid to the opposite side of the technology: the development
of more efficient techniques for the detection of invisibility devices. For
instance, the SCS ignores the phase change introduced by the cloak, as well as
the angular dependence of the incident and scattered waves. Here, we propose to
take advantage of the smarter way in which diffraction tomography processes all
this overlooked information to improve the efficiency in unveiling the presence
of invisibility devices. We show that this approach not only results in a
considerable sensitivity enhancement in the detection of different kinds of
cloaks based on both scattering cancellation and transformation optics, but
also enables us to even obtain images depicting the approximate shape and size
of the cloak. As a side result, we find that scattering cancellation coatings
may be used to enhance the contrast of tomographic images of closely-packed
particles. Our work could be easily extended to the detection of sound cloaks.

the resource owner, i.e., the Network Operator (NO), virtualizes the resources

which can be diverse and with heterogeneous requirements. Due to
confidentiality guarantees, the NO cannot observe the nature of the traffic of
SPs, which is encrypted. This makes resource allocation decisions challenging,
since they must be taken based solely on observed monitoring information. We
focus on one specific resource, i.e., cache space, deployed in some edge node,
e.g., a base station. We study the decision of the NO about how to partition
cache among several SPs in order to minimize the upstream traffic. Our goal is
to optimize cache allocation using purely data-driven, model-free Reinforcement
Learning (RL). Differently from most applications of RL, in which the decision
policy is learned offline on a simulator, we assume no previous knowledge is
available to build such a simulator. We thus apply RL in an \emph{online}

and monitoring how its performance changes. Since perturbations generate
spurious traffic, we also limit them. We show in simulation that our method
rapidly converges toward the theoretical optimum, we study its fairness, its
sensitivity to several scenario characteristics and compare it with a method
from the state-of-the-art.

spinful and spinless settings. We first apply compatibility relations (CRs)
which encode how bands split from a band node (BN) (located at a symmetric
point of BZ), to obtain all NSrs (emanating from the BN). The NSrs by CRs are
definitely strict and are exhaustively enumerated based on all irreducible
representations of the little groups for all BNs. We then construct $k\cdot p$
models around BNs and prove that there is a cutoff $k\cdot p$ order (6 at most)
for any BN which is sufficient to predict the corresponding strictly NSrs and
including higher-order $k\cdot p$ terms cannot gap the NSrs. We provide all
$k\cdot p$ models up to the cutoff orders around all the BNs, and
comprehensively explore all the nearly NSrs by lowering the $k\cdot p$ order.
Our results reveal that the same as BNs, the NSrs, especially the nearly NSrs,
are also ubiquitous. For example, while strictly nodal surface can only exist
in some nonsymmorphic MSGs, nearly nodal surface can occur even in many low
symmetric MSGs. Moreover, we also find that for some BNs, the method of $k\cdot
p$ modeling could give more strictly NSrs than CRs. With our complete list, one
can conveniently obtain all possible NSrs for any two/three-dimensional and

acids (VFAs) on the efficiency of biogas production with a focus on improving
bio-H$_2$. The inoculum used, anaerobic granular sludge obtained from a UASB
reactor treating poultry slaughterhouse wastewater, was pretreated with five
different pretreatments. The relationship between VFAs and biogas compounds was
studied as time-dependent components. In time-dependent processes with small
sample size data, regression models may not be good enough at estimating
responses. Therefore, a deep learning neural network (DNN) model was developed
to estimate the biogas compounds based on the VFAs. The accuracy of this model
to predict the biogas compounds was higher than that of multivariate regression
models. Further, it could predict the effect of time changes on biogas
compounds. Analysis showed that all the pretreatments were able to increase the
ratio of butyric acid / acetic acid successfully, decrease propionic acid
drastically, and increase the efficiency of bio-H$_2$ production. As
discovered, butyric acid had the greatest effect on bio-H$_2$, and propionic
acid had the greatest effect on CH$_4$ production. The best amounts of the VFAs
were determined using an optimization method, integrated DNN and desirability
analysis, dynamically retrained based on digestion time. Accordingly, optimal
ranges of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids were 823.2 - 1534.3, 36.3 -
47.4, and 1522 - 1822 mg/L, respectively, determined for digestion time of

characterization of the Raman spectrum, specifically of the E$^1_{2g}$- and
A$_{1g}$-modes, of mechanically exfoliated crystals of Ta$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$S$_2$, a
metallic TMD which exhibits charge density wave formation and
superconductivity. The clear identification of contributions to the Raman
spectrum coming from the SiO$_2$/Si substrate, which overlap with the peaks

clear evolution of the Raman shifts of both modes as a function of sample
thickness. The evolution of such peaks qualitatively resembles the evolution
seen in other TMDs, and provide a way of indirectly determining sample
thickness in the limit of few atomic layers at a low cost. In addition, we
observe a softening (red-shift) of both E$^1_{2g}$- and A$_{1g}$-modes with

requires averaging the optical response over all possible cluster orientations,

averaging is often done numerically by simulating the optical response for
several directions of incidence, using a spherical cubature method. The
simulation time increases with the number of directions and can become
prohibitive, yet few studies have examined the trade-off between averaging
accuracy and computational cost. We benchmark seven commonly-used spherical

the values observed with the local (Cepheids and Supernovae Ia, SNe Ia) and the
high-z probes (CMB obtained by the Planck data) still challenges the
astrophysics and cosmology community. Previous analysis has shown that there is
an evolution in the Hubble constant that scales as
$f(z)=\mathcal{H}_{0}/(1+z)^{\eta}$, where $\mathcal{H}_0$ is $H_{0}(z=0)$ and
$\eta$ is the evolutionary parameter. Here, we investigate if this evolution
still holds by using the SNe Ia gathered in the Pantheon sample and the BAOs.
We assume $H_{0}=70 \textrm{km s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ as the local value and
divide the Pantheon into 3 bins ordered in increasing values of redshift.
Similar to our previous analysis but varying two cosmological parameters
contemporaneously ($H_0$, $\Omega_{0m}$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model and $H_0$,
$w_a$ in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model), for each bin we implement a MCMC analysis
obtaining the value of $H_0$ $[...]$. Subsequently, the values of $H_0$ are
fitted with the model $f(z)$. Our results show that a decreasing trend with
$\eta \sim10^{-2}$ is still visible in this sample. The $\eta$ coefficient
reaches zero in 2.0 $\sigma$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model up to 5.8 $\sigma$ for
$w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model. This trend, if not due to statistical fluctuations,
could be explained through a hidden astrophysical bias, such as the effect of
stretch evolution, or it requires new theoretical models, a possible
proposition is the modified gravity theories, $f(R)$ $[...]$. This work is also
a preparatory to understand how the combined probes still show an evolution of
the $H_0$ by redshift and what is the current status of simulations on GRB
cosmology to obtain the uncertainties on the $\Omega_{0m}$ comparable with the
ones achieved through SNe Ia.

between two systems by applying sequences of fast actuations, under which the
coupling Hamiltonian averages out to leading order(s). One of its prominent
uses is to drive a target system in such a way as to decouple it from a less
protected one. The present manuscript investigates the dual strategy: acting on
a noisy ""environment"" subsystem such as to decouple it from a target system.
The potential advantages are that actions on the environment commute with
system operations, and that imprecisions in the decoupling actuation are
harmless to the target. We consider two versions of environment-side
decoupling: adding an imprecise Hamiltonian drive which stirs the environment
components; and, increasing the decoherence rates on the environment. The
latter can be viewed as driving the environment with pure noise and our
conclusions establish how, maybe counterintuitively, isolating the environment
from noise sources as much as possible is often not the best option. We
explicitly analyze the induced decoherence on the target system and establish
how it is influenced by the parameters in both cases. The analysis combines
Lindbladian derivation, adiabatic elimination, and Floquet modeling in a way
that may be of independent interest.

spectral radius: Given a bilinear map $*:\mathbb R^d\times\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb
R^d$ with nonnegative coefficients and a nonnegative vector $s\in\mathbb R^d$,
denote by $g(n)$ the largest possible entry of a vector obtained by combining
$n$ instances of $s$ using $n-1$ applications of $*$. Let $\lambda$ denote the
growth rate $\limsup_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{g(n)}$, Rosenfeld showed that the
problem of checking $\lambda\le 1$ is undecidable by reducing the problem of
joint spectral radius.
  In this article, we provide a simpler reduction using the observation that
matrix multiplication is actually a bilinear map. Suppose there is no
restriction on the signs, an application of this reduction is that the problem
of checking if the system can produce a zero vector is undecidable by reducing
the problem of checking the mortality of a pair of matrices. This answers a
question asked by Rosenfeld. Another application is that the problem does not
become harder when we introduce more bilinear maps or more starting vectors,
which was remarked by Rosenfeld.
  It is known that if the vector $s$ is strictly positive, then the limit
superior $\lambda$ is actually a limit. However, we show that when $s$ is only
nonnegative, the problem of checking the validity of the limit is undecidable.
This also answers a question asked by Rosenfeld.
  We provide a formula for the growth rate $\lambda$. A condition is given so
that the limit is always ensured. This actually gives a simpler proof for the
limit $\lambda$ when $s>0$. An important corollary of the formula is the
computability of the growth rate, which answers another question by Rosenfeld.
Also, we relate the finiteness property of a set of matrices to a special
structure called ""linear pattern"" for the problem of bilinear system.

classical quantum chemical theories of canonical transformation and explicit
correlation. In this work, compact ab initio Hamiltonians are generated
classically through an approximate similarity transformation of the Hamiltonian
with a) an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator with generalized
pair excitations that remove the Coulombic electron-electron singularities from
the Hamiltonian and b) a unitary one-body operator to efficiently capture the
orbital relaxation effects required for accurate description of the excited

ground and excited states of molecular systems in a balanced manner. Using the
fermionic-ADAPT-VQE method based on the unitary coupled cluster with singles
and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz and only a minimal basis set (ANO-RCC-MB), we
demonstrate that the transcorrelated Hamiltonians can produce ground state
energies comparable to the much larger cc-pVTZ basis. This leads to a potential
reduction in the number of required CNOT gates by more than three orders of
magnitude for the chemical species studied in this work. Furthermore, using the
qEOM formalism in conjunction with the transcorrelated Hamiltonian, we reduce
the errors in excitation energies by an order of magnitude. The transcorrelated

largely predict individual health, lifespan and reproductive success. Efforts
in identifying the physiological mechanisms mediating the relationship between

socially-induced stress, mediated by alterations in neuroendocrine signaling
and immune function. Here, we propose a much-needed alternative mechanism
relying on microbially-mediated effects: social relationships with
conspecifics, both in early life and adulthood, might strongly contribute both
to the transmission of beneficial microbes and to diversifying host
microbiomes. In turn, more valuable and diverse microbiomes would promote
pathogen resistance and optimal health and thus translate into positive fitness
outcomes. This mechanism relies on two emerging findings from empirical
studies, namely that microbiomes (i) are largely socially transmitted via
vertical and horizontal routes, and (ii) play a pervasive role in host
development, physiology, metabolism, and susceptibility to pathogens. We
suggest that the social transmission of microbiomes has the potential to
explain the sociality-fitness nexus, to a similar - or even higher - extent
than chronic social stress, in ways that have yet to be studied empirically in
social mammals.

wireless networks defined by random, rapidly changing transmission conditions

proper allocation of communication resources is essential to achieve reliable
operation. Designing resource allocation policies, however, is challenging,
motivating recent works to successfully exploit deep learning and deep
reinforcement learning techniques to design resource allocation and scheduling
policies for wireless control systems (WCSs). As the number of learnable
parameters in a neural network grows with the size of the input signal, deep
reinforcement learning may fail to scale, limiting the immediate generalization
of such scheduling and resource allocation policies to large-scale systems. The
interference and fading patterns among plants and controllers in the network,
however, induce a time-varying graph that can be used to construct policy
representations based on graph neural networks (GNNs), with the number of
learnable parameters now independent of the number of plants in the network. We
further establish in the context of WCSs that, due to inherent invariance to
graph permutations, the GNN is able to model scalable and transferable resource
allocation policies, which are subsequently trained with primal-dual
reinforcement learning. Numerical experiments show that the proposed graph

in robotics is characterized as a challenging problem, and more importantly, a
comprehensive evaluation benchmark for co-optimization does not exist. In this
paper, we propose Evolution Gym, the first large-scale benchmark for
co-optimizing the design and control of soft robots. In our benchmark, each
robot is composed of different types of voxels (e.g., soft, rigid, actuators),
resulting in a modular and expressive robot design space. Our benchmark
environments span a wide range of tasks, including locomotion on various types
of terrains and manipulation. Furthermore, we develop several robot
co-evolution algorithms by combining state-of-the-art design optimization
methods and deep reinforcement learning techniques. Evaluating the algorithms
on our benchmark platform, we observe robots exhibiting increasingly complex
behaviors as evolution progresses, with the best evolved designs solving many
of our proposed tasks. Additionally, even though robot designs are evolved
autonomously from scratch without prior knowledge, they often grow to resemble
existing natural creatures while outperforming hand-designed robots.
Nevertheless, all tested algorithms fail to find robots that succeed in our
hardest environments. This suggests that more advanced algorithms are required

RePaint: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based inpainting
approach that is applicable to even extreme masks. We employ a pretrained
unconditional DDPM as the generative prior. To condition the generation
process, we only alter the reverse diffusion iterations by sampling the
unmasked regions using the given image information. Since this technique does
not modify or condition the original DDPM network itself, the model produces
high-quality and diverse output images for any inpainting form. We validate our
method for both faces and general-purpose image inpainting using standard and
extreme masks.
  RePaint outperforms state-of-the-art Autoregressive, and GAN approaches for
at least five out of six mask distributions.

using both image processing and deep learning for better results. Reliable
disease detection from histo-pathology images is known as an open problem in
medical image processing and alternative solutions need to be developed. In
this context, 520 histopathology images were collected in a joint study with
Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and
Department of Pathology. Manually detecting and interpreting these images
requires expertise and a lot of processing time. For this reason,
veterinarians, especially newly recruited physicians, have a great need for
imaging and computer vision systems in the development of detection and
treatment methods for this disease. The proposed solution method in this study
is to use the CLAHE method and image processing together. After this
preprocessing, the diagnosis is made by classifying a convolutional neural
network sup-ported by the VGG-16 architecture. This method uses completely
original dataset images. Two types of systems were applied for the evaluation
parameters. While the F1 Score was 93% in the method classified without data

inspecting model outputs. However, this is not always the case for graph
generative models (GGMs), making their evaluation challenging. Currently, the
standard process for evaluating GGMs suffers from three critical limitations:
i) it does not produce a single score which makes model selection challenging,
ii) in many cases it fails to consider underlying edge and node features, and
iii) it is prohibitively slow to perform. In this work, we mitigate these
issues by searching for scalar, domain-agnostic, and scalable metrics for
evaluating and ranking GGMs. To this end, we study existing GGM metrics and
neural-network-based metrics emerging from generative models of images that use
embeddings extracted from a task-specific network. Motivated by the power of
certain Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract meaningful graph
representations without any training, we introduce several metrics based on the
features extracted by an untrained random GNN. We design experiments to
thoroughly test metrics on their ability to measure the diversity and fidelity
of generated graphs, as well as their sample and computational efficiency.
Depending on the quantity of samples, we recommend one of two random-GNN-based
metrics that we show to be more expressive than pre-existing metrics. While we
focus on applying these metrics to GGM evaluation, in practice this enables the
ability to easily compute the dissimilarity between any two sets of graphs
regardless of domain. Our code is released at:

model, has been used to perform speech enhancement (SE). However, to the best
of our knowledge, current VAE-based SE methods only apply VAE to the model
speech signal, while noise is modeled using the traditional non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF) model. One of the most important reasons for using NMF is
that these VAE-based methods cannot disentangle the speech and noise latent
variables from the observed signal. Based on Bayesian theory, this paper
derives a novel variational lower bound for VAE, which ensures that VAE can be
trained in supervision, and can disentangle speech and noise latent variables
from the observed signal. This means that the proposed method can apply the VAE
to model both speech and noise signals, which is totally different from the
previous VAE-based SE works. More specifically, the proposed DRL method can
learn to impose speech and noise signal priors to different sets of latent
variables for SE. The experimental results show that the proposed method can
not only disentangle speech and noise latent variables from the observed signal
but also obtain a higher scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio and speech
quality score than the similar deep neural network-based (DNN) SE method.

ability of BHs and their host galaxies to power an AGN depends on BH and galaxy
subgrid modeling. The fraction of AGN in low-mass galaxies is not used to

uncertainties and degeneracies affect both observations and simulations. The
agreement is difficult to interpret due to differences in the masses of
simulated and observed BHs, BH occupation fraction affected by numerical
choices, and an unknown fraction of obscured AGN. Our work advocates for more
thorough comparisons with observations to improve the modeling of cosmological
simulations, and our understanding of BH and galaxy physics in the low-mass

exoplanets provide a crucial check on models of planetary evolution. One common
approach is to model the planetary absorption signal during the transit in
lines like He I 10830 with an isothermal Parker wind, but this leads to a
degeneracy between the assumed outflow temperature $T_0$ and the mass-loss rate
$\dot{M}$ that can span orders of magnitude in $\dot{M}$. In this study, we
re-examine the isothermal Parker wind model using an energy-limited framework.
We show that in cases where photoionization is the only heat source, there is a
physical upper limit to the efficiency parameter $\varepsilon$ corresponding to
the maximal amount of heating. This allows us to rule out a subset of winds
with high temperatures and large mass-loss rates as they do not generate enough
heat to remain self-consistent. To demonstrate the utility of this framework,
we consider spectrally unresolved metastable helium observations of HAT-P-11b,
WASP-69b, and HAT-P-18b. For the former two planets, we find that only
relatively weak ($\dot{M}\lesssim 10^{11.5}$ g s$^{-1}$) outflows can match the
metastable helium observations while remaining energetically self-consistent,
while for HAT-P-18b all of the Parker wind models matching the helium data are
self-consistent. Our results are in good agreement with more detailed
self-consistent simulations and constraints from high-resolution transit

measurements reveal an asymmetrical spatial distribution of metal-rich ejecta
gas. Especially the asymmetry on the western part of the central Fe

undermassive at fixed galaxy stellar mass with respect to the M_BH-M_star
scaling relation at z=0 (BH mass offsets). Our conclusions are unchanged when
using the local scaling relation produced by each simulation or empirical
relations. We find that the BH mass offsets of the simulated faint quasar
population at z>4, unlike those of bright quasars, represent the BH mass
offsets of the entire BH population, for all the simulations. Thus, a
population of faint quasars with L_bol= 10^45-10^46 erg/s observed by JWST can
provide key constraints on the assembly of BHs at high redshift. Moreover, this
will help constraining the high-redshift regime of cosmological simulations,
including BH seeding, early growth, and co-evolution with the host galaxies.
Our results also motivate the need for simulations of larger cosmological

gain statistics on the most extreme objects at high redshift.

temperatures between 19,000 and 35,000K. We find 19 new DBVs and place upper
limits on variability for the remaining 36 objects. In combination with
previously known DBVs, we use these objects to provide an update to the
empirical extent of the DB instability strip. With our sample of new DBVs, the
red edge is better constrained, as we nearly double the number of DBVs known
between 20,000 and 24,000K. We do not find any new DBVs hotter than PG
0112+104, the current hottest DBV at $T_{\mathrm{eff}}\,{\approx}$ 31,000K, but
do find pulsations in four DBVs with temperatures between 27,000 and 30,000K,
improving empirical constraints on the poorly defined blue edge. We investigate
the ensemble pulsation properties of all currently known DBVs, finding that the
weighted mean period and total pulsation power exhibit trends with effective
temperature that are qualitatively similar to the pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere
white dwarfs.

systems quenched out of equilibrium. We focus on non-equilibrium transitions
characterized by an order parameter, which features qualitatively distinct
temporal behaviour on the two sides of a certain dynamical critical point.
Dynamical phase transitions are currently mostly understood as long-lived
prethermal phenomena in a regime where inelastic collisions are incapable to
thermalize the system. The latter enables the dynamics to substain phases that
explicitly break detailed balance and therefore cannot be encompassed by
traditional thermodynamics. Our presentation covers both cold atoms as well as
condensed matter systems. We revisit a broad plethora of platforms exhibiting
pre-thermal DPTs, which become theoretically tractable in a certain limit, such
as for a large number of particles, large number of order parameter components,
or large spatial dimension. The systems we explore include, among others,
quantum magnets with collective interactions, $\phi^4$ quantum field theories,
and Fermi-Hubbard models. A section dedicated to experimental explorations of
DPTs in condensed matter and AMO systems connects this large variety of
theoretical models.

quantum quench generated by a prototypical non-Hermitian spin chain. Using the
mapping to fermions we solve exactly the problem and compute the entanglement
entropy and the correlation dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Depending on
the quench parameters, we identify two dynamical phases. One is characterized
by rapidly saturating entanglement and correlations. The other instead presents
a logarithmic growth in time, and correlations spreading faster than the
Lieb-Robinson bound, with collapses and revivals giving rise to a modulated
light-cone structure. Here, in the long-time limit, we compute analytically the
entanglement entropy that we show to scale logarithmically with the size of the

results provide an example of an exactly solvable non-Hermitian many-body

soft states. The system displays a triangular shape in the hardness intensity
diagram, consistent with that seen in high inclination black hole transients
and the previously reported detection of X-ray dips. The two epochs observed
during the initial hard state exhibited asymmetric emission line profiles,
including a P-Cygni profile simultaneously detected in H-alpha and He I 6678,
which indicates the presence of an optical wind in the system. The remaining
spectra, obtained during the transition to the soft state and the subsequent

embedded into broad absorption components. One epoch (intermediate state) also
includes near-infrared coverage, revealing complex line profiles in the Paschen

outburst decay through the soft state. The growing list of low-mass X-ray
binaries with optical and near-infrared outflow signatures indicates that these
are common features. Furthermore, the lowest luminosity spectrum exhibits an
H-alpha full-width-at-half-maximum of 1570 +- 100 km/s. This, together with

the U-band excess positive lag, or the X-ray excess negative lag that is seen
in most AGN. However, these excess lags are seen in the two subsequent
intervals of higher X-ray luminosity. Although the data are limited, the excess
lags appear to scale with X-ray luminosity. Our modelling shows that lags
expected from reprocessing of X-rays by the accretion disc vary hardly at all
with increasing luminosity. Therefore, as the U-band excess almost certainly
arises from Balmer continuum emission from the broad line region (BLR), we
attribute these lag changes to changes in the contribution from the BLR. The
change is easily explained by the usual increase in the inner radius of the BLR
with increasing ionising luminosity.

that separates the smaller super-Earths ($\lesssim$1.7 Earth radii) from the
larger sub-Neptunes ($\sim$1.7--4 Earth radii). While mass loss theories can
explain many of the observed features of this radius valley, it is difficult to
reconcile them with potentially rising population of terrestrials beyond
orbital periods of $\sim$30 days. We investigate the ability of gas accretion
during the gas-poor phase of disk evolution to reproduce both the location of
the observed radius gap and the existence of long-period terrestrial planets.
Updating the analytic scaling relations of gas accretion rate accounting for
the shrinking of the bound radius by hydrodynamic effects and deriving a more
realistic disk temperature profile, we find that the late-stage gas accretion
alone is able to carve out the observed radius gap, with slopes $R_{\rm gap}
\propto P^{-0.096}$ and $R_{\rm gap} \propto M_\star^{0.15}$ for top-heavy; and
$R_{\rm gap} \propto P^{-0.089}$ and $R_{\rm gap} \propto M_\star^{0.22}$ for
bottom-heavy core mass distributions, in good agreement with observations. The
general morphology of the primordial radius gap is stable against a range of
disk gas density and disk accretion rate with the latter affecting mostly the
population of large planets ($\gtrsim$3--4$R_\oplus$). The peaks and valleys in
the radius distribution were likely set in place primordially while
post-formation mass loss further tunes the exoplanetary population. We provide
potential observational tests that may be possible with TESS, PLATO and Roman

giant planet formation, has proven to be difficult. We currently lack a
far-infrared observatory capable of observing HD, and the most common gas mass
tracer, CO, suffers from a poorly constrained CO-to-H$_2$ ratio. Expanding on
previous work, we investigate if N2H+, a chemical tracer of CO poor gas, can be
used to observationally measure the CO-to-H$_2$ ratio and correct CO-based gas
masses. Using disk structures obtained from the literature, we set up
thermochemical models for three disks, TW Hya, DM Tau and GM Aur, to examine
how well the CO-to-H$_2$ ratio and gas mass can be measured from N2H+ and C18O
line fluxes. Furthermore, we compare these gas masses to independently gas
masses measured from archival HD observations. The N2H+ (3-2)/C18O (2-1) line
ratio scales with the disk CO-to-H$_2$ ratio. Using these two lines, we measure
4.6e-3 Msun < Mdisk < 1.1e-1 Msun for TW Hya, 1.5e-2 Msun < Mdisk < 9.6e-2 Msun
for GM Aur and 3.1e-2 Msun < Mdisk < 9.6e-2 Msun for DM Tau. These gas masses
agree with values obtained from HD within their respective uncertainties. The
uncertainty on the N2H+ + C18O gas mass can be reduced by observationally
constraining the cosmic ray ionization rate in disks. These results demonstrate
the potential of using the combination of N2H+ and C18O to measure gas masses
of protoplanetary disks.

the radio cut-out images from the FIRST survey, we first designed a deep
learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the quasar
radio morphologies into the core-only, young jet, single lobe, or triples.
These radio morphologies are further sub-classified into core-dominated and
lobe-dominated sources. The CNN models can classify the sources with a high
precision of >98% for all the morphological sub-classes. The average BAL
fraction in the resolved core, core-dominated, and lobe-dominated quasars are
consistent with the BAL fraction inferred from radio and infra-red surveys. We
also present the distribution of BAL quasars as a function of quasar
orientation by using the radio core-dominance as an orientation indicator. A
similar analysis is performed for HiBALs, LoBALs, and FeLoBALs. All the radio
morphological sub-classes and BAL sub-classes show an increase in BAL fraction
at high orientation angles of the jets with respect to the line of sight. Our
analysis suggests that BAL quasars are more likely to be found in viewing
angles close to the equatorial plane of the quasar. However, a pure orientation
model is inadequate, and a combination of orientation and evolution is probably
the best way to explain the complete BAL phenomena.

high spins to prove agreement of both amplitudes. Lastly, this setup allows us
to explore non-uniform vertex amplitudes, where some representations are small

and exhibit a comparable incidence of tidal features (which indicate recent
interactions). We explore the AGN properties by combining the predicted gas
conditions in dwarfs from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with a
Monte-Carlo suite of simulated radio sources, based on a semi-analytical model
for radio-galaxy evolution. In the subset of LOFAR-detectable simulated
sources, which have a similar distribution of radio luminosities as our
observed AGN, the median jet powers, ages and accretion rates are $\sim
10^{35}$ W, $\sim 5$ Myr and $\sim 10^{-3.4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$
respectively. The median mechanical energy output of these sources is $\sim100$
times larger than the median binding energy expected in dwarf gas reservoirs,
making AGN feedback plausible. Since special circumstances (in terms of
environment, gas availability and interactions) are not necessary for the
presence of AGN, and the central gas masses are predicted to be an order of
magnitude larger than that required to fuel the AGN, AGN triggering in dwarfs
is likely to be stochastic and a common phenomenon. Together with the
plausibility of energetic feedback, this suggests that AGN could be important
drivers of dwarf-galaxy evolution, as is the case in massive galaxies.

exoplanetary atmospheres by measuring the wavelength-dependent radius of a
planet as it transits its star. Transmission spectroscopy relies on a precise
understanding of the spectrum of the star being occulted. However, stars are
not homogeneous, constant light sources but have temporally evolving
photospheres and chromospheres with inhomogeneities like spots, faculae,
plages, granules, and flares. This SAG brought together an interdisciplinary
team of more than 100 scientists, with observers and theorists from the
heliophysics, stellar astrophysics, planetary science, and exoplanetary
atmosphere research communities, to study the current research needs that can
be addressed in this context to make the most of transit studies from current

star accreting from a red supergiant companion. Although known for nearly 50
years, detailed characterization of the donor remains lacking, particularly due
to the extremely high reddening towards the source ($A_V\gtrsim25$ mag). Here,
we present i) improved localization of the counterpart using Gaia and Chandra
observations, ii) the first broadband infrared spectrum ($\approx1-5\,\mu$m;
$R\approx 2000$) obtained with SpeX on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and
iii) $J$-band light curve from the Palomar Gattini-IR survey. The infrared
spectrum is characterized by i) deep water absorption features (H$_2$O index
$\approx 40$%), ii) strong TiO, VO and CO features, and iii) weak/absent CN
lines. We show that these features are inconsistent with known red supergiants,
but suggest a M8-9 III type O-rich Mira donor star. We report the discovery of
large amplitude ($\Delta J\approx3.5$ mag) periodic photometric variability
suggesting a pulsation period of
$621\pm36\,{\rm(systematic)}\pm8\,{\rm(statistical)}$ days, which we use to
constrain the donor to be a relatively luminous Mira ($M_K=-8.6\pm0.3$ mag) at
a distance of $3.6^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ kpc. Comparing these characteristics to
recent models, we find the donor to be consistent with a $\approx 3-5$
M$_\odot$ star at an age of $\approx 0.1-0.3$ Gyr. Together, we show that Sct
X-1 was previously mis-classified as an evolved High Mass X-ray Binary; instead
it is an intermediate mass system with the first confirmed Mira donor in an

that is robust against missing classes in the training data, i.e., during
testing we can prescribe classes that are missing during training. This
framework relies on two main components: (1) our newly proposed
ordinal-quadruplet loss, which forces the model to learn latent representation
while preserving the ordinal relation among labels, (2) testing procedure,
which utilizes the property of latent representation (order preservation). We
conduct experiments based on real world multivariate time series data and show
the significant improvement in the prediction of missing labels even with 40%
of the classes are missing from training. Compared with the well-known triplet
loss optimization augmented with interpolation for missing information, in some
cases, we nearly double the accuracy.

fine-tuned, and the Efimov effect does not operate. The theory has one
dimensionless coupling which formally runs to a Landau pole in the ultraviolet.
We show that many properties of the system are universal in the double

information, which is encoded in a hierarchal structure of short and long-term

architectures ignore this kind of local and global effect. To address this
problem, we propose to integrate a novel temporal attentive-pooling (TAP)

Second, we exploit a novelattention mechanism to contextually process salient
regions of the noisy signals. The proposed ASE system is evaluated using a

Previously, these shells were assumed to have a single temperature component

observations, we show that the X-ray emission of the shells is more complex and
best described by a two-temperature thermal model: one component close to the

Furthermore, we demonstrate that temperatures of the virial and super-virial

emission measures are significantly higher in the shells. This leads us to
conclude that the eROSITA bubble shells are X-ray bright because they trace
denser gas, not because they are hotter. Given that the pre- and post-shock
temperatures are similar and the compression ratio of the shock is high, we
rule out that the bubble shells trace adiabatic shocks, in contrast to what was
assumed in previous studies. We also observe non-solar Ne/O and Mg/O ratios in
the shells, favouring stellar feedback models for the formation of the bubbles

their performance assess their impact on the electricity market outcomes and
examine how these depend on the level of RES penetration. Since market

precise predictor of satisfaction, (iii) avoiding the difficult task of finding
a way to explicitly turn formulae into vectors of numbers in a sensible way. We

correctors corresponding to these harmonic functions and prove growth estimates

the basis for fracture mechanics; the energy flowing into a crack front is
precisely balanced by the dissipation (fracture energy) at the front. If the
crack front structure is not properly accounted for, energy balance will either
appear to fail or lead to unrealistic results. Here, we study the influence of
the secondary structure of low-speed crack propagation in hydrogels under
tensile loading conditions. We first show that these cracks are bistable;
either simple (cracks having no secondary structure) or faceted crack states
(formed by steps propagating along crack fronts) can be generated under
identical loading conditions. The selection of either crack state is determined
by the form of the initial `seed' crack; perfect seed cracks generate simple
cracks while a small local mode~III component generates crack fronts having
multiple steps. Step coarsening eventually leads to single steps that propagate
along crack fronts. As they evolve, steps locally change the instantaneous
structure and motion of the crack front, breaking transverse translational
invariance. In contrast to simple cracks, faceted cracks can, therefore, no
longer be considered as existing in a quasi-2D system. For both simple and
faceted cracks we simultaneously measure the energy flux and local dissipation
along these crack fronts over velocities, $v$, spanning $0<v<0.2c_R$ ($c_R$ is
the Rayleigh wave speed). We find that, in the presence of secondary structure
within the crack front, the implementation of energy balance must be
generalized for 3D systems; faceted cracks reveal energy balance, only when we
account for the local dynamic dissipation at each point along the crack front.

  Fuzzing has emerged as a promising technique for detecting software

proposed. However, they suffer from several limitations, including
non-applicability to commonly used Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) like
Verilog and VHDL, the need for significant human intervention, and inability to
capture many intrinsic hardware behaviors, such as signal transitions and
floating wires.
  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel hardware
fuzzer, TheHuzz, that overcomes the aforementioned limitations and
significantly improves the state of the art. We analyze the intrinsic behaviors
of hardware designs in HDLs and then measure the coverage metrics that model
such behaviors. TheHuzz generates assembly-level instructions to increase the
desired coverage values, thereby finding many hardware bugs that are
exploitable from software. We evaluate TheHuzz on four popular open-source
processors and achieve 1.98x and 3.33x the speed compared to the
industry-standard random regression approach and the state-of-the-art hardware

prompted an intense debate on whether a substantial revision of the standard
picture of tetrahedrally bonded water was necessary to improve the agreement of
theory and experiment. Here, we report a new first-principles calculation of
the XAS of water that avoids the approximations of prior work thanks to recent
advances in electron excitation theory. The calculated XAS spectra, and their
variation with changes of temperature and/or with isotope substitution, are in
excellent quantitative agreement with experiments. The approach requires
accurate quasi-particle wavefunctions beyond density functional theory
approximations, accounts for the dynamics of quasi-particles and includes
dynamic screening as well as renormalization effects due to the continuum of
valence-level excitations. The three features observed in the experimental
spectra are unambiguously attributed to excitonic effects. The pre-edge feature
is associated to a bound intramolecular exciton, the main-edge feature is
associated to an exciton localized within the coordination shell of the excited
molecule, while the post-edge one is delocalized over more distant neighbors,
as expected for a resonant state. The three features probe the local order at
short, intermediate, and longer range relative to the excited molecule. The

optimal subset of observed sensor signals to be exploited is crucial in order
to maximize algorithmic performance and reduce computational load, ideally both
at the same time. In the acoustic domain, signal cross-correlation is a natural
choice to quantify the usefulness of microphone signals, i.e., microphone
utility, for array processing, but its estimation requires that the uncoded
signals are synchronized and transmitted between nodes. In resource-constrained
environments like acoustic sensor networks, low data transmission rates often
make transmission of all observed signals to the centralized location
infeasible, thus discouraging direct estimation of signal cross-correlation.
Instead, we employ characteristic features of the recorded signals to estimate
the usefulness of individual microphone signals. In this contribution, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of model-based microphone utility estimation
approaches that use signal features and, as an alternative, also propose
machine learning-based estimation methods that identify optimal sensor signal
utility features. The performance of both approaches is validated
experimentally using both simulated and recorded acoustic data, comprising a

analysis and nonlinear numerical simulations. The length over depth ratio was
two and the Reynolds numbers based on cavity depth were close to 1000. The
effect of Mach on such cavities was studied. The global analysis revealed that,
in the Mach range 0.1 to 0.9, for thick boundary layers, only R1 and R2 modes
could become unstable, whereas for thin boundary layer up to R4 could be
unstable. Compressibility was very destabilizing at low Mach. At moderate Mach
the instability either saturated with Mach or had an irregular dependence.
Analysis of the Rossiter mode eigenfunctions indicated that the acoustic
feedback scaled to Ma^3, and explained the strong destabilizing effect of
compressibility. The irregular dependence was associated with resonances
between Rossiter modes and acoustic cavity modes. The analysis explained why
the irregular Mach dependence occurred only for higher order Rossiter modes. In
this parameter region three dimensional modes are stable or marginally
unstable. Two-dimensional simulations were performed to evaluate how much of
the nonlinear regime could be captured by the linear stability results. As the
flow became more unstable, an increasing more complex final stage was reached.
Yet the spectra present distinct tones that are close to linear predictions.
However, a closer look reveals the dominant frequency in the saturated state
corresponds to R1 while linear theory predicts R2 as the most unstable mode.
This is associated with a nonlinear thickening of the mixing layer in the
nonlinear regime. Moreover, the frequencies are much closer to Rossiter
empirical predictions than the linear instability ones. Even at these
conditions close to critical, the spectra are well described by the mode R1 and
a cascade of nonlinearly generated harmonics, with no reminiscence of the
linear instability.

Latent Space Optimization (ReLSO), a deep transformer-based autoencoder which

ReLSO introduces a powerful protein sequence encoder and novel approach for
efficient fitness landscape traversal. Using ReLSO, we explicitly model the
sequence-function landscape of large labeled datasets and generate new
molecules by optimizing within the latent space using gradient-based methods.
We evaluate this approach on several publicly-available protein datasets,
including variant sets of anti-ranibizumab and GFP. We observe a greater
sequence optimization efficiency (increase in fitness per optimization step) by
ReLSO compared to other approaches, where ReLSO more robustly generates
high-fitness sequences. Furthermore, the attention-based relationships learned
by the jointly-trained ReLSO models provides a potential avenue towards
sequence-level fitness attribution information.

system to drive transitions between metastable states. The bias potential is a
function of a few collective variables and is gradually modified according to
the underlying free energy surface. We show that when the collective variables
are suboptimal, there is an exploration-convergence tradeoff, and one must
choose between a quickly converging bias that will lead to fewer transitions,
or a slower to converge bias that can explore the phase space more efficiently
but might require a much longer time to produce an accurate free energy
estimate. The recently proposed On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES)
method focuses on fast convergence, but there are cases where fast exploration
is preferred instead. For this reason, we introduce a new variant of the OPES

convergence speed. We illustrate the benefits of this approach on prototypical
systems and show that it outperforms the popular metadynamics method.

While being a ubiquitous phenomenon, the control of the flutter response has
been primarily limited to simplified systems and, often, with the help of
linear inviscid flow theories. In this paper, we numerically investigate how
the plunging response of a foil can be regulated using an active flap to
improve structural safety or enhance the energy extraction efficiency of the
foil with a tightly coupled fluid-structure interaction algorithm. A broad
range of foil and flap settings was tested and their flow dynamics have been
investigated. A novel multi-scale modal analysis technique suitable for
fluid-structure interaction systems successfully isolates the active
flap-induced and the flow-induced modes. It is observed that the competition
between these two modes dictates the plunging response of the foil. The active
flap can modulate the leading edge vortex shedding with larger flapping
amplitude and regulate the foil heaving motion. The ratio of the competing
modal energy is proposed to evaluate the control efficacy of the morphing
surface, and the onset of the lock-in is associated with the ratio approaching
unity. It is shown that the morphing flap is a good candidate for active flow

on their digestive mechanism are expected to speculate a novel rule in wood

carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the intestine of beetle larvae, an insect
model, are investigated. Bacterial analysis of larval feces showed enrichment
of members of which could include candidates for plant growth promotion,
nitrogen cycle modulation, and/or environmental protection. The abundances of
these bacteria were not necessarily positively correlated with the abundance in
the habitat, suggesting that they might be selectively enriched in the
intestines of larvae. Further association analysis predicted that carbon and
nitrogen metabolism in the intestine was affected by the presence of the other
common bacteria, the populations of which were not remarkably altered in the
habitat and feces. Based on hypotheses targeting these selected bacterial
groups, structural estimation modeling analyses statistically suggested that
their metabolism of carbon and nitrogen and their stable isotopes, {\delta}13C

common bacteria. In addition, other causal inference analyses, such as causal
mediation analysis, linear non-Gaussian acyclic model (LiNGAM), and

data distributed by examples, horizontal partitioning, but we lack a
counterpart for data scattered by features, an increasingly common scheme (e.g.
user profiling with data from multiple entities). To fill this gap, we provide
an EM-based algorithm to fit Gaussian mixtures to Vertically Partitioned data
(VP-EM). In federated learning setups, our algorithm matches the centralized EM
fitting of Gaussian mixtures constrained to a subspace. In arbitrary
communication graphs, consensus averaging allows VP-EM to run on large
peer-to-peer networks as an EM approximation. This mismatch comes from
consensus error only, which vanishes exponentially fast with the number of
consensus rounds. We demonstrate VP-EM on various topologies for both synthetic

it outperforms the available benchmark.

industry to synthesize realistic images. Due to data not being centrally
available, Multi-Discriminator (MD)-GANs training framework employs multiple
discriminators that have direct access to the real data. Distributedly training
a joint GAN model entails the risk of free-riders, i.e., participants that aim
to benefit from the common model while only pretending to participate in the
training process. In this paper, we conduct the first characterization study of
the impact of free-riders on MD-GAN. Based on two production prototypes of
MD-GAN, we find that free-riders drastically reduce the ability of MD-GANs to
produce images that are indistinguishable from real data, i.e., they increase
the FID score -- the standard measure to assess the quality of generated
images. To mitigate the model degradation, we propose a defense strategy
against free-riders in MD-GAN, termed DFG. DFG distinguishes free-riders and
benign participants through periodic probing and clustering of discriminators'
responses based on a reference response of free-riders, which then allows the
generator to exclude the detected free-riders from the training. Furthermore,
we extend our defense, termed DFG+, to enable discriminators to filter out
free-riders at the variant of MD-GAN that allows peer exchanges of
discriminators networks. Extensive evaluation on various scenarios of
free-riders, MD-GAN architecture, and three datasets show that our defenses
effectively detect free-riders. With 1 to 5 free-riders, DFG and DFG+ averagely
decreases FID by 5.22% to 11.53% for CIFAR10 and 5.79% to 13.22% for CIFAR100
in comparison to an attack without defense. In a shell, the proposed DFG(+) can
effectively defend against free-riders without affecting benign clients at a
negligible computation overhead.

variability in functional data. Recent studies have developed various
approaches to estimate optimal warping between functions and provide
non-Euclidean models. However, a principled, linear, generative model on time
warping functions is still under-explored. This is a highly challenging problem
because the space of warping functions is non-linear with the conventional
Euclidean metric. To address this problem, we propose a stochastic process
model for time warping functions, where the key is to define a linear,
inner-product structure on the time warping space and then transform the
warping functions into a sub-space of the $\mathbb L^2$ Euclidean space. With
certain constraints on the warping functions, this transformation is an
isometric isomorphism. In the transformed space, we adopt the $\mathbb L^2$

build generative model on time warping by using different types of stochastic

functional PCA, functional ANOVA, and functional regressions. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of this new framework by using it as a new prior

address the important maximum a posteriori estimation. We illustrate the new
Bayesian method using simulations which properly characterize nonuniform and

by suppressing both the parameters. We further sketch the quantum

observed that the critical number of colors $N^{c}_c$ enhances while the
critical number of flavors $N^{c}_f$ suppresses as $T$ and $\mu$ increases. Of
course, the parameters $T$ and $\mu$ produce the screening effect.
Consequently, the critical temperature $T_c$, $\mu_c$ and co-ordinates of the

variable projection (VarPro) framework and artificial neural networks (ANN).
For linear PDEs, enforcing the boundary/initial value problem on the
collocation points leads to a separable nonlinear least squares problem about
the network coefficients. We reformulate this problem by the VarPro approach to
eliminate the linear output-layer coefficients, leading to a reduced problem
about the hidden-layer coefficients only. The reduced problem is solved first
by the nonlinear least squares method to determine the hidden-layer
coefficients, and then the output-layer coefficients are computed by the linear
least squares method. For nonlinear PDEs, enforcing the boundary/initial value
problem on the collocation points leads to a nonlinear least squares problem
that is not separable, which precludes the VarPro strategy for such problems.
To enable the VarPro approach for nonlinear PDEs, we first linearize the
problem with a Newton iteration, using a particular form of linearization. The
linearized system is solved by the VarPro framework together with ANNs. Upon
convergence of the Newton iteration, the network coefficients provide the
representation of the solution field to the original nonlinear problem. We
present ample numerical examples with linear and nonlinear PDEs to demonstrate
the performance of the method herein. For smooth field solutions, the errors of
the current method decrease exponentially as the number of collocation points
or the number of output-layer coefficients increases. We compare the current
method with the ELM method from a previous work. Under identical conditions and
network configurations, the current method exhibits an accuracy significantly
superior to the ELM method.

homogeneous tasks. The agent can service a task with a normal or high fidelity
level, where fidelity refers to the degree of exactness and precision while
servicing the task. Therefore, high-fidelity servicing results in
higher-quality service but leads to larger service times and increased operator
tiredness. We treat the cognitive state of the human operator as a lumped
parameter that captures psychological factors such as workload and fatigue. The
service time distribution of the human operator depends on her cognitive
dynamics and the fidelity level selected for servicing the task. Her cognitive
dynamics evolve as a Markov chain in which the cognitive state increases with
high probability whenever she is busy and decreases while resting. The tasks
arrive according to a Poisson process and the operator is penalized at a fixed
rate for each task waiting in the queue. We address the trade-off between
high-quality service of the task and consequent penalty due to subsequent
increase in queue length using a discrete-time Semi-Markov Decision Process
(SMDP) framework. We numerically determine an optimal policy and the
corresponding optimal value function. Finally, we establish the structural
properties of an optimal fidelity policy and provide conditions under which the
optimal policy is a threshold-based policy.

massive dense cluster with the stellar densities of $\sim 10^{4}~\rm

clusters. Thus, we suggest that the radiative feedback and the initial

preparing a spoof signal that is a close enough copy to fool a receiver. A
classic application of spoofing is in radar where an airborne target attempts
to avoid being tracked by a ground-based radar by emitting pulses indicating a
false range or velocity. In certain scenarios it has been shown that a sensor
can exploit quantum mechanics to detect spoofing at the single-photon level.
Here we analyze an idealized spoofing scenario where a transmitter-receiver
pair, seeking to detect spoofing, utilizes a signal chosen randomly from a set
of non-orthogonal, coherent states. We show that a spoofer optimally employing
classical information on the state of the transmitted signal (i.e. the best
measure-and-prepare strategy allowed by quantum mechanics) inevitably emits
imperfect spoofs that can be exploited by the receiver to reveal the presence
of the spoofer, or to discriminate between true reflections and spoofs.
Importantly, we show that the quantum limitations on classical spoofing remain
significant even in the large mean-photon-number regime.

manifold clustering aims to cluster data points based on manifold structures
and also learn to parameterize each manifold as a linear subspace in a feature

highly non-linear settings given their large capacity and flexibility. We argue
that achieving manifold clustering with neural networks requires two essential
ingredients: a domain-specific constraint that ensures the identification of
the manifolds, and a learning algorithm for embedding each manifold to a linear
subspace in the feature space. This work shows that many constraints can be
implemented by data augmentation. For subspace feature learning, Maximum Coding
Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$) objective can be used. Putting them together yields
{\em Neural Manifold Clustering and Embedding} (NMCE), a novel method for
general purpose manifold clustering, which significantly outperforms
autoencoder-based deep subspace clustering. Further, on more challenging
natural image datasets, NMCE can also outperform other algorithms specifically
designed for clustering. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that NMCE learns a

dataset are available. As a result, researchers have relied on unsupervised
domain adaptation to leverage the labels in a dataset (the source domain) to
perform better classification in a different, unlabeled dataset (target
domain). Existing non-generative adversarial solutions for UDA aim at achieving
domain confusion through adversarial training. The ideal scenario is that
perfect domain confusion is achieved, but this is not guaranteed to be true. To
further enforce domain confusion on top of the adversarial training, we propose
a novel UDA algorithm, \textit{E-ADDA}, which uses both a novel variation of
the Mahalanobis distance loss and an out-of-distribution detection subroutine.
The Mahalanobis distance loss minimizes the distribution-wise distance between
the encoded target samples and the distribution of the source domain, thus
enforcing additional domain confusion on top of adversarial training. Then, the
OOD subroutine further eliminates samples on which the domain confusion is
unsuccessful. We have performed extensive and comprehensive evaluations of
E-ADDA in the acoustic and computer vision modalities. In the acoustic
modality, E-ADDA outperforms several state-of-the-art UDA algorithms by up to
29.8%, measured in the f1 score. In the computer vision modality, the

dynamics of the multiferroic insulator TbMnO$_3$ in the low temperature
antiferromagnetic and ferroelectrically ordered phase. The lattice response
following photoexcitation at 1.55 eV is detected by measuring the (0 2 4) and
(1 3 -5) Bragg reflections. A 0.02% tensile strain, normal to the surface, is
seen to arise within 20 - 30 ps. The magnitude of this transient strain is over
an order of magnitude lower than that predicted from laser-induced heating,
which we attribute to a bottleneck in the energy transfer between the
electronic and lattice subsystems. The timescale for the transient expansion is
consistent with that of previously reported demagnetization dynamics. We
discuss a possible relationship between structural and demagnetization dynamics
in TbMnO$_3$, in which photoinduced atomic motion modulates the exchange
interaction, leading to a destruction of the magnetic order in the system.

anisotropy. The localized orbitals near the Fermi level are three, one of
symmetry $z^2$ and two (nearly) degenerate $\pi$ orbitals of symmetry $xz$ and
$yz$. Previous studies using the numerical renormalization group neglected one
of these orbitals to render the problem tractable. Here we investigate, using a
slave-boson mean-field approximation, if the splitting $S$ between $\pi$
orbitals caused by spin-orbit coupling (SOC) justifies this approximation. We
obtain an abrupt transition from a 3-band regime to a 2-band one at a value of
$S$ which is about 1/3 of the atomic SOC for Fe, justifying the 2-band model
for the system.

In particular, a system of two species subject to binary reaction and transport

This work extends model forms from weakly-nonlinear extensions of that
dispersion theory and the role of nonlocality in the presence of reactions is
studied and captured by analytic expressions. These expressions can be
incorporated into an eddy diffusivity matrix that explicitly capture the
influence of chemical kinetics and flow conditions on the closure operators and
we demonstrate that the model form derived in a laminar context can be directly
translated to an analogous setup in homogeneous isotropic turbulence, which has

imposes low-rank tensor structure on the Poisson parameter space.
  Our main result shows that an $N$-way rank-$R$ parametric tensor

Poisson observations can be accurately estimated by zero-truncated Poisson
regression from approximately $IR^2\log_2^2(I)$ non-zero counts under the
nonnegative canonical polyadic decomposition. Our result also quantifies the
error made by zero-truncating the Poisson distribution when the parameter is

in under-determined scenarios with substantial corruption by false zeros.

(DR1) of high-resolution optical spectra of 1305 planet hosts. Refined CKS
planet radii revealed that small planets are bifurcated into two distinct
populations: super-Earths (smaller than 1.5 $R_E$) and sub-Neptunes (between
2.0 and 4.0 $R_E$), with few planets in between (the ""Radius Gap."") Several
theoretical models of the Radius Gap predict variation with stellar mass, but
testing these predictions are challenging with CKS DR1 due to its limited
$M_\star$ range of 0.8-1.4 $M_\odot$. Here, we present CKS DR2 with 411
additional spectra and derived properties focusing on stars of 0.5-0.8
$M_\odot$. We found the Radius Gap follows $R_p \propto P^m$ with $m = -0.10
\pm 0.03$, consistent with predictions of XUV- and core-powered mass-loss
mechanisms. We found no evidence that $m$ varies with $M_\star$. We observed a
correlation between the average sub-Neptune size and $M_\star$. Over 0.5 to 1.4
$M_\odot$, the average sub-Neptune grows from 2.1 to 2.6 $R_E$, following $R_p
\propto M_\star^\alpha$ with $\alpha = 0.25 \pm 0.03$. In contrast, there is no
detectable change for super-Earths. These $M_\star$-$R_p$ trends suggests that
protoplanetary disks can efficiently produce cores up to a threshold mass of
$M_c$, which grows linearly with stellar mass according to $M_c \approx 10
M_E~(M_\star / M_\odot)$. There is no significant correlation between
sub-Neptune size and stellar metallicity (over $-$0.5 to $+$0.5 dex) suggesting
a weak relationship between planet envelope opacity and stellar metallicity.
Finally, there is no significant variation in sub-Neptune size with stellar age
(over 1 to 10 Gyr), which suggests that the majority of envelope contraction
concludes after $\sim$1 Gyr.

significant or can safely be ignored is a pivotal task across fields. Rigid
body modeling has thus long remained a fundamental tool and is, by far, the
most popular simulation strategy currently employed for modeling stiff solids.
At the same time, numerical models of a rigid body continue to pose a number of
known challenges and trade-offs including intersections, instabilities,
inaccuracies, and/or slow performances that grow with contact-problem
complexity. In this paper we revisit this problem and present ABD, a simple and
highly effective affine body dynamics framework, which significantly improves
state-of-the-art stiff simulations. We trace the challenges in the rigid-body
IPC (incremental potential contact) method to the necessity of linearizing
piecewise-rigid (SE(3)) trajectories and subsequent constraints. ABD instead
relaxes the unnecessary (and unrealistic) constraint that each body's motion be
exactly rigid with a stiff orthogonality potential, while preserving the rigid
body model's key feature of a small coordinate representation. In doing so ABD
replaces piecewise linearization with piecewise linear trajectories. This, in
turn, combines the best from both parties: compact coordinates ensure small,
sparse system solves, while piecewise-linear trajectories enable efficient and
accurate constraint (contact and joint) evaluations. Beginning with this simple
foundation, ABD preserves all guarantees of the underlying IPC model e.g.,
solution convergence, guaranteed non-intersection, and accurate frictional
contact. Over a wide range and scale of simulation problems we demonstrate that
ABD brings orders of magnitude performance gains (two- to three-order on the
CPU and an order more utilizing the GPU, which is 10,000x speedups) over prior
IPC-based methods with a similar or higher simulation quality.

in relaxation spectra at lower temperatures on the high frequency flank of the
alpha-loss peak in analogy to the excess wings observed experimentally in
molecular glass-formers. Their remarkable finding leads to the question of
where the excess wing is located relative to the alpha-loss peak in the
susceptibility spectrum. I provide an answer by identifying the excess wing as
the unresolved Johari-Goldstein (JG) b-relaxation and using the reciprocal of
its relaxation time tau_JG to assess the location of the excess wing. The
Coupling Model (CM) has a history of being successful in determining
approximately the values of tau_JG(T) in molecular liquids whether the JG
beta-relaxation is resolved or not (i.e., excess wing). It is applied to the
simulation data and the results of tau_JG(T) successfully account for the
locations of the excess wings in the simulation spectra at different
temperatures. The time evolution of the dynamics of the distribution of
processes composing the JG b-relaxation suggested by the CM based on
experimental data in molecular glass-formers are in agreement with that given
by Guiselin et al. from simulations of a size-polydisperse mixture of N soft
spheres interacting with a repulsive power law pair potential. The agreement
brings their results closer to experimental data of real molecular

  Intergalactic Supernova Remnant?","20 pages accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac210",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report the discovery of J0624-6948, a low-surface brightness radio ring,
lying between the Galactic Plane and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). It was
first detected at 888 MHz with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP), and with a diameter of ~196 arcsec. This source has phenomenological
similarities to Odd Radio Circles (ORCs). Significant differences to the known
ORCs - a flatter radio spectral index, the lack of a prominent central galaxy
as a possible host, and larger apparent size - suggest that J0624-6948 may be a
different type of object. We argue that the most plausible explanation for
J0624-6948 is an intergalactic supernova remnant due to a star that resided in
the LMC outskirts that had undergone a single-degenerate type Ia supernova, and
we are seeing its remnant expand into a rarefied, intergalactic environment. We
also examine if a massive star or a white dwarf binary ejected from either
galaxy could be the supernova progenitor. Finally, we consider several other
hypotheses for the nature of the object, including the jets of an active
galactic nucleus (AGN) or the remnant of a nearby stellar super-flare.

quasi-one-dimensional linearised Euler equations. The equations are cast in
terms of three variables, namely the dimensionless mass, stagnation temperature
and entropy fluctuations, which are invariants of the system at zero frequency
and with no heat transfer. The resulting first-order system of differential
equations is then solved using the Magnus expansion method, where the
perturbation parameters are the normalised frequency and the volumetric heat
transfer. In this work, a measure of the flow non-isentropicity (in this case
the steady heat transfer) is used for the first time as an expansion parameter.
The solution method was applied to a converging-diverging nozzle with constant
heat transfer for both sub-critical and super-critical flow cases, showing good
agreement with numerical predictions. It was observed that the acoustic and
entropy transfer functions of the nozzle strongly depend on the frequency and
heat transfer.

skills of `where to look?' for an object and `how to navigate to (x, y)?'. Our
key insight is that `where to look?' can be treated purely as a perception
problem, and learned without environment interactions. To address this, we
propose a network that predicts two complementary potential functions
conditioned on a semantic map and uses them to decide where to look for an
unseen object. We train the potential function network using supervised
learning on a passive dataset of top-down semantic maps, and integrate it into
a modular framework to perform ObjectGoal navigation. Experiments on Gibson and

ObjectGoal navigation while incurring up to 1,600x less computational cost for

wireless networks to support new applications with stringent service
reliability and latency requirements. However, guaranteeing ultra-reliable and
low-latency MEC (URLL MEC) is very challenging due to uncertainties of wireless
links, limited communications and computing resources, as well as dynamic
network traffic. Enabling URLL MEC mandates taking into account the statistics
of the end-to-end (E2E) latency and reliability across the wireless and edge
computing systems. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to optimize the
reliability of MEC networks by considering the distribution of E2E service
delay, encompassing over-the-air transmission and edge computing latency. The
proposed framework builds on correlated variational autoencoders (VAEs) to
estimate the full distribution of the E2E service delay. Using this result, a
new optimization problem based on risk theory is formulated to maximize the
network reliability by minimizing the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a
risk measure of the E2E service delay. To solve this problem, a new algorithm
is developed to efficiently allocate users' processing tasks to edge computing
servers across the MEC network, while considering the statistics of the E2E
service delay learned by VAEs. The simulation results show that the proposed
scheme outperforms several baselines that do not account for the risk analyses

systems, point cloud registration attracts vast attention and has been attained
with various deep learning-based algorithms. The unsupervised registration
algorithms take advantage of deep neural network-enabled novel representation
learning while requiring no human annotations, making them applicable to
industrial applications. However, unsupervised methods mainly depend on global
descriptors, which ignore the high-level representations of local geometries.
In this paper, we propose to jointly use both global and local descriptors to
register point clouds in a self-supervised manner, which is motivated by a
critical observation that all local geometries of point clouds are transformed
consistently under the same transformation. Therefore, local geometries can be
employed to enhance the representation ability of the feature extraction
module. Moreover, the proposed local descriptor is flexible and can be
integrated into most existing registration methods and improve their
performance. Besides, we also utilize point cloud reconstruction and normal
estimation to enhance the transformation awareness of global and local
descriptors. Lastly, extensive experimental results on one synthetic and three
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-art unsupervised registration methods and even surpasses supervised
ones in some cases. Robustness and computational efficiency evaluations also
indicate that the proposed method applies to intelligent vehicles.

high-temperature superconductors. In particular, the superconducting gap
symmetry of nickelates has hardly been investigated and remains controversial.
Here, we report the pairing symmetry of the infinite-layer nickelates
determined by London penetration depth measurements in neodymium-based
(Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ and lanthanide-based (La,Ca)NiO$_2$ thin films of high

lanthanide nickelates follow dirty line-node behaviour, the
neodymium-counterpart exhibits nodeless order parameters such as the $(d+is)$

order parameter in nickelates is beyond a single $d_(x^2-y^2 )$-wave gap.
Furthermore, the superfluid density shows a long tail near the superconducting
transition temperature which is consistent with the emergence of a
two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover in the superconducting state.

flows: one is simple periodical double-gyre flow as a proof-of-concept example,
while the other is complex turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection as a paradigm
for migrating in the convective atmosphere or the ocean. The results show that
the smart agent in both flows can learn to migrate from one position to another

energy consumption, which is evident by comparing the smart agent with a naive
agent that moves straight from the origin to the destination. In addition, we
found that compared to the double-gyre flow, the flow field in the turbulent
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection exhibits more substantial fluctuations, and the
training agent is more likely to explore different migration strategies; thus,
the training process is more difficult to converge. Nevertheless, we can still
identify an energy-efficient trajectory that corresponds to the strategy with
the highest reward received by the agent. These results have important
implications for many migration problems such as unmanned aerial vehicles

(C$_2$H$_5$CN, CH$_3$OCHO and CH$_3$OH), based on ALMA Three-millimeter
Observations of Massive Star-forming regions (ATOMS). The angular resolutions
and line sensitivities of the ALMA observations are better than 2 arcsec and 10
mJy/beam, respectively. A total of 60 hot cores are identified with 45 being
newly detected, in which the complex organic molecules have high gas
temperatures ($>$ 100 K) and small source sizes ($<$ 0.1 pc). So far this is
the largest sample of hot cores observed with similar angular resolution and
spectral coverage. The observations have also shown nitrogen and oxygen
differentiation in both line emission and gas distribution in 29 hot cores.
Column densities of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$OCHO increase as rotation temperatures
rise. The column density of CH$_3$OCHO correlates tightly with that of
CH$_3$OH. The pathways for production of different species are discussed. Based
on the spatial position difference between hot cores and UC~H{\sc ii} regions,
we conclude that 24 hot cores are externally heated while the other hot cores
are internally heated. The observations presented here will potentially help
establish a hot core template for studying massive star formation and
astrochemistry.

boundary layer (WRIBL) method, is presented for flow through a thin-gap
geometry wherein the fluid's viscosity varies across the gap. In such
situations, the flow has a non-parabolic cross-gap velocity profile -- an
effect that is ignored by Darcy models conventionally used for such Hele-Shaw
flows. The WRIBL technique systematically accounts for the cross-gap variation
of viscosity and yields reduced-order equations for the gap-averaged fluid flow
rate. As a test case, we consider a fluid with a temperature-dependent
viscosity and analyse the previously-studied problem of thermoviscous
fingering: a hot fluid flowing through a Hele-Shaw geometry with cold walls
spontaneously forms channels of low-viscosity, hot fluid, separated by regions
of high-viscosity, cold fluid. The temperature of the cold walls is assumed
either to be constant, a scenario that mimics the upward flow of magma through
fissures in the Earth's crust, or to vary linearly along the direction of flow.
In both cases, the predictions of the WRIBL model, regarding the multiplicity
of uniform steady flow states and their linear stability, are compared with
that of the hitherto used, ad hoc, Darcy model (Helfrich, J. Fluid Mech., vol.
305, 1995, pp. 219-238), as well as with calculations of the full
three-dimensional governing equations (Wylie and Lister, J. Fluid Mech., vol.
305, 1995, pp. 239-261). Though the results are qualitatively similar, the
WRIBL model is found to be much more accurate than the Darcy model. The
averaging method is presented in a general manner to facilitate its application
to other physical situations where, for example, the viscosity depends on
solute/particle concentration in a solution/suspension.

converts magnetic energy into some combination of plasma flow energy, thermal

Various reconnection acceleration mechanisms in different low-$\beta$
(plasma-to-magnetic pressure ratio) and collisionless environments have been
proposed theoretically and studied numerically, including first- and
second-order Fermi acceleration, betatron acceleration, parallel electric field
acceleration along magnetic fields, and direct acceleration by the reconnection
electric field. However, none of them have been heretofore confirmed
experimentally, as the direct observation of non-thermal particle acceleration
in laboratory experiments has been difficult due to short Debye lengths for
\textit{in-situ} measurements and short mean free paths for \textit{ex-situ}
measurements. Here we report the direct measurement of accelerated non-thermal
electrons from low-$\beta$ magnetically driven reconnection in experiments
using a laser-powered capacitor coil platform. We use kiloJoule lasers to drive
parallel currents to reconnect MegaGauss-level magnetic fields in a
quasi-axisymmetric geometry. The angular dependence of the measured electron
energy spectrum and the resulting accelerated energies, supported by
particle-in-cell simulations, indicate that the mechanism of direct electric
field acceleration by the out-of-plane reconnection electric field is at work.
Scaled energies using this mechanism show direct relevance to astrophysical
observations. Our results therefore validate one of the proposed acceleration
mechanisms by reconnection, and establish a new approach to study reconnection
particle acceleration with laboratory experiments in relevant regimes.

This work proposes the task of target identification, which determines whether
a specific test instance is the target of a training-set attack. Target
identification can be combined with adversarial-instance identification to find
(and remove) the attack instances, mitigating the attack with minimal impact on
other predictions. Rather than focusing on a single attack method or data
modality, we build on influence estimation, which quantifies each training
instance's contribution to a model's prediction. We show that existing
influence estimators' poor practical performance often derives from their
over-reliance on training instances and iterations with large losses. Our
renormalized influence estimators fix this weakness; they far outperform the
original estimators at identifying influential groups of training examples in
both adversarial and non-adversarial settings, even finding up to 100% of
adversarial training instances with no clean-data false positives. Target
identification then simplifies to detecting test instances with anomalous
influence values. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on backdoor and
poisoning attacks across various data domains, including text, vision, and
speech, as well as against a gray-box, adaptive attacker that specifically
optimizes the adversarial instances to evade our method. Our source code is

  Characteristic Three",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been known that the insufficiency of linear coding in achieving the
optimal rate of the general index coding problem is rooted in its rate's
dependency on the field size. However, this dependency has been described only
through the two well-known matroid instances, namely the Fano and non-Fano
matroids, which, in turn, limits its scope only to the fields with
characteristic two. In this paper, we extend this scope to demonstrate the
reliance of linear index coding rate on fields with characteristic three. By
constructing two index coding instances of size 29, we prove that for the first
instance, linear coding is optimal only over the fields with characteristic
three, and for the second instance, linear coding over any field with
characteristic three can never be optimal. Then, a variation of the second
instance is designed as the third index coding instance of size 58. For this
instance, it is proved that while linear coding over any field with
characteristic three cannot be optimal, there exists a nonlinear code over the
fields with characteristic three, which achieves its optimal rate. Connecting
the first and third index coding instances in two specific ways, called no-way
and two-way connections, will lead to two new index coding instances of size 87
and 91, for which linear coding is outperformed by nonlinear codes.
  Another main contribution of this paper is the reduction of the key
constraints on the space of the linear coding for the first and second index
coding instances, each of size 29, into a matroid instance with the ground set
of size 9, whose linear representability is dependent on the fields with
characteristic three. The proofs and discussions provided in this paper through
using these two relatively small matroid instances will shed light on the
underlying reason causing the linear coding to become insufficient for the
general index coding problem.

can be efficiently diagonalized by the discrete sine transform matrix. More
specifically, our approach is to first permute the original linear system to
obtain a symmetric one, and subsequently develop a desired preconditioner based
on the spectral symbol of the modified matrix. Then, we show that the
eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix sequences are clustered around $\pm
1$, which entails rapid convergence, when the minimal residual method is
devised. Alternatively, when the conjugate gradient method on normal equations
is used, we show that our preconditioner is effective in the sense that the
eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix sequence are clustered around the
unity. An extension of our proposed preconditioned method is given for
high-order backward difference time discretization schemes, which applies on a
wide range of time-dependent equations. Numerical examples are given to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed preconditioner, which
consistently outperforms an existing block circulant preconditioner discussed
in the relevant literature.

Self-Supervised Learning (CSSL) framework that fully exploits structural
context prediction for link prediction. The proposed CSSL framework learns a
link encoder to infer the link existence probability from paired node

generate informative node embeddings for link prediction, structural context
prediction is leveraged as a self-supervised learning task to boost the link

aneurysm formation, we employ the incompressible Gent model and select three
representative modulus gradients, including a linear, an exponential, and a
sinusoidal function. In particular, the sinusoidal distribution can be used to
model actual artery structure. In addition, two prototypical loading conditions
are considered, namely, either the resultant axial force or the axial length
can be fixed. Based on an explicit bifurcation condition in terms of the
internal pressure and the resultant axial force for aneurysm formation or
localized bulging, an exhaustive theoretical analysis on bulge initiation is
carried out and the effect of geometric and material parameters and modulus
gradient on the critical stretch generating localized bulging is revealed. It
turns out that the modulus mismatch, as well as the position of maximum
modulus, can dramatically affect the onset of localized bulging. Then we
analytically elucidate the influence of modulus gradient on bulge propagation
and conduct a finite element analysis of bulge evolution based on a robust
finite element model established in Abaqus by UHYPER subroutine coding.
Interestingly, it is found that a sinusoidally distributed modulus has
negligible influence on the critical stretch of bulge initiation, the
deformation process of bugle growth, and the maximum size of a bulge. The
current analysis can provide useful insight into the biological evolution of

However, they may fail due to lack of training data, resulting in high rates of
missed detection and false positives (FPs). In order to solve these problems,
our method combines the two-dimensional (2-D) CNN-based real-time object
detector network with spatiotemporal information. Firstly, we use a 2-D
detector network to detect static images and frames, and based on the detector
network, we propose two feature enhancement modules-the FP Relearning Module
(FPRM) to make the detector network learning more about the features of FPs for
higher precision, and the Image Style Transfer Module (ISTM) to enhance the
features of polyps for sensitivity improvement. In video detection, we
integrate spatiotemporal information, which uses Structural Similarity (SSIM)
to measure the similarity between video frames. Finally, we propose the
Inter-frame Similarity Correlation Unit (ISCU) to combine the results obtained
by the detector network and frame similarity to make the final decision. We

Experimental results show that these modules and units provide a performance

deployment of intelligent agents in the real world. However, comparing reward
functions, for example as a means of evaluating reward learning methods,
presents a challenge. Reward functions are typically compared by considering
the behavior of optimized policies, but this approach conflates deficiencies in
the reward function with those of the policy search algorithm used to optimize
it. To address this challenge, Gleave et al. (2020) propose the
Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance. EPIC avoids policy
optimization, but in doing so requires computing reward values at transitions
that may be impossible under the system dynamics. This is problematic for
learned reward functions because it entails evaluating them outside of their
training distribution, resulting in inaccurate reward values that we show can
render EPIC ineffective at comparing rewards. To address this problem, we
propose the Dynamics-Aware Reward Distance (DARD), a new reward pseudometric.
DARD uses an approximate transition model of the environment to transform
reward functions into a form that allows for comparisons that are invariant to
reward shaping while only evaluating reward functions on transitions close to
their training distribution. Experiments in simulated physical domains
demonstrate that DARD enables reliable reward comparisons without policy
optimization and is significantly more predictive than baseline methods of
downstream policy performance when dealing with learned reward functions.

average execution time of a coded computing system is related to the error

between the average execution time and the scaling exponent $\mu$ of the family
of codes. The scaling exponent has emerged as a central object in the
finite-length characterization of polar codes, and it captures the speed of
convergence to capacity. In particular, we show that (i) the gap between the
normalized average execution time of polar codes and that of optimal MDS codes
is $O(n^{-1/\mu})$, and (ii) this upper bound can be improved to roughly
$O(n^{-1/2})$ by considering polar codes with large kernels. We conjecture that
these bounds could be improved to $O(n^{-2/\mu})$ and $O(n^{-1})$,

distributed machine learning framework, where many clients collaboratively
train a machine learning model by exchanging model updates with a parameter
server instead of sharing their raw data. Nevertheless, FL training suffers
from slow convergence and unstable performance due to stragglers caused by the
heterogeneous computational resources of clients and fluctuating communication
rates. This paper proposes a coded FL framework to mitigate the straggler
issue, namely stochastic coded federated learning (SCFL). In this framework,
each client generates a privacy-preserving coded dataset by adding additive
noise to the random linear combination of its local data. The server collects
the coded datasets from all the clients to construct a composite dataset, which
helps to compensate for the straggling effect. In the training process, the
server as well as clients perform mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
and the server adds a make-up term in model aggregation to obtain unbiased
gradient estimates. We characterize the privacy guarantee by the mutual
information differential privacy (MI-DP) and analyze the convergence
performance in federated learning. Besides, we demonstrate a
privacy-performance tradeoff of the proposed SCFL method by analyzing the
influence of the privacy constraint on the convergence rate. Finally, numerical
experiments corroborate our analysis and show the benefits of SCFL in achieving
fast convergence while preserving data privacy.

(HOG+SVM) attained the best performance metrics across all datasets. The
recognition accuracy of the HOG+SVM method on the NumtaDB, CMARTdb, Ekush and
BDRW datasets reached 93.32%, 98.08%, 95.68% and 89.68%, respectively as well
as we compared the model performance with recent state-of-art methods.

  pre-trained acoustic and language models","Accepted by ICASSP2022",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While Transformers have achieved promising results in end-to-end (E2E)
automatic speech recognition (ASR), their autoregressive (AR) structure becomes
a bottleneck for speeding up the decoding process. For real-world deployment,
ASR systems are desired to be highly accurate while achieving fast inference.
Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have become a popular alternative due to their
fast inference speed, but they still fall behind AR systems in recognition
accuracy. To fulfill the two demands, in this paper, we propose a NAR
CTC/attention model utilizing both pre-trained acoustic and language models:
wav2vec2.0 and BERT. To bridge the modality gap between speech and text
representations obtained from the pre-trained models, we design a novel
modality conversion mechanism, which is more suitable for logographic
languages. During inference, we employ a CTC branch to generate a target
length, which enables the BERT to predict tokens in parallel. We also design a
cache-based CTC/attention joint decoding method to improve the recognition
accuracy while keeping the decoding speed fast. Experimental results show that
the proposed NAR model greatly outperforms our strong wav2vec2.0 CTC baseline
(15.1% relative CER reduction on AISHELL-1). The proposed NAR model
significantly surpasses previous NAR systems on the AISHELL-1 benchmark and
shows a potential for English tasks.

waves from the low-mass X-ray binary Scorpius X-1, using a hidden Markov model
(HMM) to allow for spin wandering. This search improves on previous HMM-based
searches of Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) data by
including the orbital period in the search template grid, and by analyzing data
from the latest (third) observing run (O3). In the frequency range searched,
from 60 to 500 Hz, we find no evidence of gravitational radiation. This is the
most sensitive search for Scorpius X-1 using a HMM to date. For the most
sensitive sub-band, starting at $256.06$Hz, we report an upper limit on
gravitational wave strain (at $95 \%$ confidence) of
$h_{0}^{95\%}=6.16\times10^{-26}$, assuming the orbital inclination angle takes
its electromagnetically restricted value $\iota=44^{\circ}$. The upper limits
on gravitational wave strain reported here are on average a factor of $\sim 3$
lower than in the O2 HMM search. This is the first Scorpius X-1 HMM search with
upper limits that reach below the indirect torque-balance limit for certain
sub-bands, assuming $\iota=44^{\circ}$.

to investigate efficient algorithms with theoretical performance guarantee. In

fish-eye images often appear in arbitrary directions and are distorted
differently. Due to this unique radial geometry, axis-aligned people detectors
often work poorly on fish-eye frames. Recent works account for this variability
by modifying existing anchor-based detectors or relying on complex
pre/post-processing. Anchor-based methods spread a set of pre-defined bounding
boxes on the input image, most of which are invalid. In addition to being
inefficient, this approach could lead to a significant imbalance between the
positive and negative anchor boxes. In this work, we propose ARPD, a
single-stage anchor-free fully convolutional network to detect arbitrarily
rotated people in fish-eye images. Our network uses keypoint estimation to find
the center point of each object and regress the object's other properties
directly. To capture the various orientation of people in fish-eye cameras, in
addition to the center and size, ARPD also predicts the angle of each bounding
box. We also propose a periodic loss function that accounts for angle
periodicity and relieves the difficulty of learning small-angle oscillations.
Experimental results show that our method competes favorably with
state-of-the-art algorithms while running significantly faster.

it becomes difficult for users to seek new friends or broaden their social
networks in an efficient way. Link prediction, which can effectively conquer
this problem, has thus attracted wide attention. Previous methods on link
prediction fail to comprehensively capture the factors leading to new link
formation: 1) few models have considered the varied impacts of users'
short-term and long-term interests on link prediction. Besides, they fail to
jointly model the influence from social influence and ""weak links""; 2)
considering that different factors should be derived from information sources
of different modalities, there is a lack of effective multi-modal framework for
link prediction. In this view, we propose a novel multi-modal framework for
link prediction (referred as LP-UIT) which fuses a comprehensive set of
features (i.e., user information and topological features) extracted from
multi-modal information (i.e., textual information, graph information, and
numerical information). Specifically, we adopt graph convolutional network to
process the network information to capture topological features, employ natural
language processing techniques (i.e., TF-IDF and word2Vec) to model users'
short-term and long-term interests, and identify social influence and ""weak
links"" from numerical features. We further use an attention mechanism to model
the relationship between textual and topological features. Finally, a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is designed to combine the representations from
three modalities for link prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world

  Transmission",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deterministic IP (DIP) networking is a promising technique that can provide
delay-bounded transmission in large-scale networks. Nevertheless, DIP faces
several challenges in the mixed traffic scenarios, including (i) the capability
of ultra-low latency communications, (ii) the simultaneous satisfaction of
diverse QoS requirements, and (iii) the network efficiency. The problems are
more formidable in the dynamic surroundings without prior knowledge of traffic
demands. To address the above-mentioned issues, this paper designs a flexible
DIP (FDIP) network. In the proposed network, we classify the queues at the
output port into multiple groups. Each group operates with different cycle
lengths. FDIP can assign the time-sensitive flows with different groups, hence
delivering diverse QoS requirements, simultaneously. The ultra-low latency
communication can be achieved by specific groups with short cycle lengths.
Moreover, the flexible scheduling with diverse cycle lengths improves resource
utilization, hence increasing the throughput (i.e., the number of acceptable
time-sensitive flows). We formulate a throughput maximization problem that
jointly considers the admission control, transmission path selection, and cycle
length assignment. A branch and bound (BnB)-based heuristic is developed.
Simulation results show that the proposed FDIP significantly outperforms the
standard DIP in terms of both the throughput and the latency guarantees.

formulation that solves a sequence of integer programs and terminates with a
global solution or an error bound. The combinatorial subproblems are amenable
to a quantum annealer, which helps to tighten the bound efficiently. While our
usage of quantum computing does not surmount the fundamental intractability of
robust fitting, by providing error bounds our algorithm is a practical
improvement over randomised heuristics. Moreover, our work represents a
concrete application of quantum computing in computer vision. We present

Networking (TSN) which aims to provide bounded transmission delays and
ultra-low jitters in industrial local area networks. With the development of
emerging technologies (e.g., cloud computing), many wide-range time-sensitive
network services emerge, such as factory automation, connected vehicles, and
smart grids. Nevertheless, TAS is a Layer 2 technique for local networks, and
cannot provide large-scale deterministic transmission. To tackle this problem,
this paper proposes a hierarchical network containing access networks and a
core network. Access networks perform TAS to aggregate time-sensitive traffic.
In the core network, we exploit DIP (a well-known deterministic networking
mechanism for backbone networks) to achieve long-distance deterministic
transmission. Due to the differences between TAS and DIP, we design
cross-domain transmission mechanisms at the edge of access networks and the
core network to achieve seamless deterministic transmission. We also formulate
the end-to-end scheduling to maximize the amount of accepted time-sensitive

structured data (clinical codes) and unstructured data (clinical narratives)
have recently been increasingly applied to the healthcare domain. Most existing
EHR-oriented studies, however, either focus on a particular modality or
integrate data from different modalities in a straightforward manner, which
usually treats structured and unstructured data as two independent sources of
information about patient admission and ignore the intrinsic interactions
between them. In fact, the two modalities are documented during the same
encounter where structured data inform the documentation of unstructured data
and vice versa. In this paper, we proposed a Medical Multimodal Pre-trained
Language Model, named MedM-PLM, to learn enhanced EHR representations over
structured and unstructured data and explore the interaction of two modalities.
In MedM-PLM, two Transformer-based neural network components are firstly
adopted to learn representative characteristics from each modality. A
cross-modal module is then introduced to model their interactions. We
pre-trained MedM-PLM on the MIMIC-III dataset and verified the effectiveness of
the model on three downstream clinical tasks, i.e., medication recommendation,
30-day readmission prediction and ICD coding. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the power of MedM-PLM compared with state-of-the-art methods. Further analyses

a graph-learning-assisted power estimation approach for FPGA HLS, which

network (GNN) model. Specifically, in the graph construction flow, we introduce
buffer insertion, datapath merging, graph trimming and feature annotation
techniques to transform HLS designs into graph-structured data, which encode
both intra-operation micro-architectures and inter-operation interconnects
annotated with switching activities. Furthermore, we propose a novel
power-aware heterogeneous edge-centric GNN model which effectively learns
heterogeneous edge semantics and structural properties of the constructed
graphs via edge-centric neighborhood aggregation, and fits the formulation of
dynamic power. Compared with on-board measurement, PowerGear estimates total

respectively, which outperforms the prior arts in research and the commercial
product Vivado. In addition, PowerGear demonstrates a speedup of 4x over Vivado

between the voters. It could be the case that an alternate social choice
function becomes more ideal to aggregate the preferences. There could be a
constraint to operate the voting system at a specific level of either privacy
or influence or welfare, and one would like to know the effects on rest of the
unconstrained choices. In this paper, we introduce notions of welfare and
probabilistic influence of privatization mechanisms to help precisely answer
such questions through the proposed results. Throughout the paper, we restrict
our work to social choice functions where several voters vote for either of two
candidates. We present two different ways of proving each of our results that
connects privacy with welfare & probabilistic influence: i.) by using first
principles from combinatorics/probability, ii.) by using Fourier analysis of
Boolean functions. Finally, we analyze the accuracy of the private mechanism on
various social choice functions. The results in this paper thereby help bridge
two prominent fields of social choice theory and differential privacy.

Classical novae are powered by thermonuclear runaways occurring on
the surface of accreting white dwarfs (WDs). In the observations, the
enrichments of heavy elements in nova ejecta have been detected, indicating a
mixing process between the accreted matter and the matter from the outer layers
of the underlying WDs prior to nova outbursts. However, the mixing fraction in
classical novae is still uncertain.
  Aims. The purpose of this article is to investigate some elemental abundance
ratios during nova outbursts that can be used to estimate the WD mixing
fraction in classical novae.
  Methods. By considering different WD mixing fractions with the stellar
evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we
carried out a series of simulations of nova outbursts, in which the initial CO
WD masses range from $0.7-1.0\,M_\odot$.
  Results. We identified four elemental abundance ratios (i.e. $\rm (H+He)/\sum
CNO$, $\rm (H+He)/Ne$, $\rm \sum CNO/Mg,$ and $\rm \sum CNO/Si$) that satisfy
the conditions for determining the WD mixing fraction, in which $\rm
(H+He)/\sum CNO$ is the most suitable mixing meter. We also estimated the WD
mixing fraction in some representative classical novae. Additionally, we found
that a higher metallicity (i.e. higher WD mixing fraction) is preferentially
accompanied by a longer $t_{\rm 2}$ (the time of decline by two magnitudes from
peak luminosity) during nova outbursts. Our results can be used to constrain
the mixing process in classical novae.

  Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS-22)",,,,"cs.GT econ.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Periodic double auctions (PDA) have applications in many areas such as in
e-commerce, intra-day equity markets, and day-ahead energy markets in
smart-grids. While the trades accomplished using PDAs are worth trillions of
dollars, finding a reliable bidding strategy in such auctions is still a
challenge as it requires the consideration of future auctions. A participating
buyer in a PDA has to design its bidding strategy by planning for current and
future auctions. Many equilibrium-based bidding strategies proposed are complex
to use in real-time. In the current exposition, we propose a scale-based
bidding strategy for buyers participating in PDA. We first present an
equilibrium analysis for single-buyer single-seller multi-unit single-shot
k-Double auctions. Specifically, we analyze the situation when a seller and a
buyer trade two identical units of quantity in a double auction where both the
buyer and the seller deploy a simple, scale-based bidding strategy. The
equilibrium analysis becomes intractable as the number of participants
increases. To be useful in more complex settings such as wholesale markets in
smart-grids, we model equilibrium bidding strategy as a learning problem. We
develop a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) based learning strategy,
DDPGBBS, for a participating agent in PDAs to suggest an action at any auction
instance. DDPGBBS, which empirically follows the obtained theoretical
equilibrium, is easily extendable when the number of buyers/sellers increases.
We take Power Trading Agent Competition's (PowerTAC) wholesale market PDA as a
testbed to evaluate our novel bidding strategy. We benchmark our DDPG based
strategy against several baselines and state-of-the-art bidding strategies of
the PowerTAC wholesale market PDA and demonstrate the efficacy of DDPGBBS
against several benchmarked strategies.

show that IGN-small still contains function class rich enough that can
approximate spectral GNNs arbitrarily well. Lastly, we perform experiments on

singing voice conversion (SVC) to generate high-quality singing audio. However,
the instability of GAN also leads to other problems, such as pitch jitters and
U/V errors. It affects the smoothness and continuity of harmonics, hence
degrades the conversion quality seriously. This paper proposes to feed harmonic
signals to the SVC model in advance to enhance audio generation. We extract the
sine excitation from the pitch, and filter it with a linear time-varying (LTV)
filter estimated by a neural network. Both these two harmonic signals are
adopted as the inputs to generate the singing waveform. In our experiments, two
mainstream models, MelGAN and ParallelWaveGAN, are investigated to validate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. We conduct a MOS test on clean and
noisy test sets. The result shows that both signals significantly improve SVC
in fidelity and timbre similarity. Besides, the case analysis further validates
that this method enhances the smoothness and continuity of harmonics in the
generated audio, and the filtered excitation better matches the target audio.

excitons, which emit in the red region of visible spectrum. We find that the B
excitons couple to HMM differently compared to A excitons. The fabricated HMM
transforms to a hyperbolic dispersive medium at 2.13 eV, from an elliptical
dispersive medium. The selective coupling of B Excitons to the HMM modes is
attributed to the inbuilt field gradient of the transition. The B exciton
energy lies close to the transition point of the HMM, relative to A Exciton.
So, the HMM modes couple more to the B excitons and the metamaterial functions
as selective coupler. The coupling strength calculations show that coupling is
2.5 times stronger for B excitons relative to A excitons. High near field of
HMM, large magnitude and the in-plane transition dipole moment of MoS$_2$
Excitons, result in strong coupling of B excitons and formation of hybrid
light-matter states. The measured differential Reflection and Photoluminescence
spectra indicate the presence of hybrid light-matter states i.e.
Exciton-Polaritons. Rabi splitting of at least 129 meV at room temperature is
observed. The low temperature Photoluminescence measurement shows mode
anticrossing, which is characteristic feature of hybrid states. Our results

surrounding the gap-closing lines, and the jump of the Berry flux gives the
jump of the topological charge (up to a $2\pi$ factor) across the transitions.
For the Berry flux measurement, we employ a new method by examining the
geometric rotations of both spin vectors and tensors, which lead to a
generalized solid angle equal to the Berry flux. The controllability of
multi-level ion offers a versatile platform to study high-spin physics and our

several structural properties of these graphs, such as the density, number of
cycles, nodes, edges, etc. We then utilized the attribute values of those SCGs
to visualize and detect buggy software commits. We process more than 246K
software commits from 12 subject systems in this investigation. Our
investigation on these 12 open-source software projects written in C++ and Java
programming languages shows that if we combine the features from SCG with
conventional features used in similar studies, we will get the increased
performance of Machine Learning (ML) based buggy commit detection models. We
also find the increase of F1~Scores in predicting buggy and non-buggy commits
statistically significant using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. Since SCG-based
feature values represent the style or structural properties of source code
updates or changes in the software system, it suggests the importance of
careful maintenance of source code style or structure for keeping a software

  Loss for Writer Independent Offline Signature Verification","Accepted at ICPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Offline Signature Verification (OSV) is a fundamental biometric task across
various forensic, commercial and legal applications. The underlying task at
hand is to carefully model fine-grained features of the signatures to
distinguish between genuine and forged ones, which differ only in minute
deformities. This makes OSV more challenging compared to other verification
problems. In this work, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework that
leverages self-supervised representation learning as well as metric learning
for writer-independent OSV. First, we train an image reconstruction network
using an encoder-decoder architecture that is augmented by a 2D spatial
attention mechanism using signature image patches. Next, the trained encoder
backbone is fine-tuned with a projector head using a supervised metric learning
framework, whose objective is to optimize a novel dual triplet loss by sampling
negative samples from both within the same writer class as well as from other
writers. The intuition behind this is to ensure that a signature sample lies
closer to its positive counterpart compared to negative samples from both
intra-writer and cross-writer sets. This results in robust discriminative
learning of the embedding space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work of using self-supervised learning frameworks for OSV. The proposed
two-stage framework has been evaluated on two publicly available offline
signature datasets and compared with various state-of-the-art methods. It is
noted that the proposed method provided promising results outperforming several

expansion in RFC1. In addition to the core CANVAS phenotype (sensory
neuronopathy, cerebellar syndrome, and vestibular impairment), we observed
chronic cough (97%), oculomotor signs (85%), motor neuron involvement (55%),
dysautonomia (50%), and parkinsonism (10%). Motor neuron involvement was found
for 24 of 38 patients (63.1%). First motor neuron signs, such as brisk
reflexes, extensor plantar responses, and/or spasticity, were present in 29% of

carried a heterozygous AAGGG expansion and a pathogenic variant in GRM1.
Neuropathological examination of one RFC1 patient with an enriched phenotype,
including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and cognitive decline, showed posterior
column and lumbar posterior root atrophy. Degeneration of the vestibulospinal
and spinocerebellar tracts was mild. We observed marked astrocytic gliosis and
axonal swelling of the synapse between first and second motor neurons in the
anterior horn at the lumbar level. The cerebellum showed mild depletion of
Purkinje cells, with empty baskets, torpedoes, and astrogliosis characterized
by a disorganization of the Bergmann's radial glia. We found neuronal loss in
the vagal nucleus. The pars compacta of the substantia nigra was depleted, with
widespread Lewy bodies in the locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, hippocampus,
entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. We propose new guidelines for the screening of
RFC1 expansion, considering different expansion motifs. Here, we developed a
new method to more easily detect pathogenic RFC1 expansions. We report frequent
motor neuron involvement and different neuronopathy subtypes. Parkinsonism was
more prevalent in this cohort than in the general population, 10% versus the
expected 1% (p < .001). We describe, for the first time, the spinal cord

$T>0$, the trajectory $\{\phi_t x\}_{0 \le t \le cT}$ is $1/T$-dense in $X$. We
show that a linear flow on a translation surface is superdense if and only if

Existence and uniqueness of the corresponding Cauchy problem is established in

heterogeneous components; consequently, most of their critical failures relate
to the interoperability of such components.Unfortunately, most CPS test
automation techniques are preliminary and industry still heavily relies on
manual testing. With potentially incomplete, manually-generated test suites, it
is of paramount importance to assess their quality. Though mutation analysis
has demonstrated to be an effective means to assess test suite quality in some
specific contexts, we lack approaches for CPSs. Indeed, existing approaches do
not target interoperability problems and cannot be executed in the presence of
black-box or simulated components, a typical situation with CPSs.
  In this paper, we introduce data-driven mutation analysis, an approach that
consists in assessing test suite quality by verifying if it detects
interoperability faults simulated by mutating the data exchanged by software
components. To this end, we describe a data-driven mutation analysis technique
(DaMAT) that automatically alters the data exchanged through data buffers. Our
technique is driven by fault models in tabular form where engineers specify how
to mutate data items by selecting and configuring a set of mutation operators.
  We have evaluated DaMAT with CPSs in the space domain; specifically, the test
suites for the software systems of a microsatellite and nanosatellites launched
on orbit last year. Our results show that the approach effectively detects test
suite shortcomings, is not affected by equivalent and redundant mutants, and
entails acceptable costs.

2-monotone lower probabilities and probability intervals, we provide a detailed

  Bitstream for AI Tasks","21 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Traditional media coding schemes typically encode image/video into a
semantic-unknown binary stream, which fails to directly support downstream
intelligent tasks at the bitstream level. Semantically Structured Image Coding
(SSIC) framework makes the first attempt to enable decoding-free or
partial-decoding image intelligent task analysis via a Semantically Structured
Bitstream (SSB). However, the SSIC only considers image coding and its
generated SSB only contains the static object information. In this paper, we
extend the idea of semantically structured coding from video coding perspective
and propose an advanced Semantically Structured Video Coding (SSVC) framework
to support heterogeneous intelligent applications. Video signals contain more
rich dynamic motion information and exist more redundancy due to the similarity
between adjacent frames. Thus, we present a reformulation of semantically
structured bitstream (SSB) in SSVC which contains both static object
characteristics and dynamic motion clues. Specifically, we introduce optical
flow to encode continuous motion information and reduce cross-frame redundancy
via a predictive coding architecture, then the optical flow and residual
information are reorganized into SSB, which enables the proposed SSVC could
better adaptively support video-based downstream intelligent applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SSVC framework could
directly support multiple intelligent tasks just depending on a partially
decoded bitstream. This avoids the full bitstream decompression and thus
significantly saves bitrate/bandwidth consumption for intelligent analytics. We
verify this point on the tasks of image object detection, pose estimation,
video action recognition, video object segmentation, etc.

consistent propagation of (super)conformal higher-spin fields on curved three-
and four-dimensional (super)spaces. In the first half of this thesis we
systematically derive models for conformal fields of arbitrary rank on various
types of curved spacetimes. On generic conformally-flat backgrounds in three
$(3d)$ and four $(4d)$ dimensions, we obtain closed-form expressions for the
actions which are manifestly gauge and Weyl invariant. Similar results are
provided for generalised conformal fields, which have higher-depth gauge
transformations. In three dimensions, conformally-flat spacetimes are the most
general backgrounds allowing consistent propagation. In four dimensions, it is
widely expected that gauge invariance can be extended to Bach-flat backgrounds,
although no complete models for spin greater than two exist. We confirm these
expectations for the first time by constructing a number of complete
gauge-invariant models for conformal fields with higher spin. In the second
half of this thesis we employ superspace techniques to extend the above results
to conformal higher-spin theories possessing off-shell supersymmetry.
  Several novel applications of our results are also provided. In particular,
transverse projection operators are constructed in $4d$ anti-de Sitter
(AdS$_4$) space, and their poles are shown to be associated with
partially-massless fields. This allows us to demonstrate that on such
backgrounds, the (super)conformal higher-spin kinetic operator factorises into
products of second order operators. Similar conclusions are drawn in AdS$_3$
(super)space. Finally, we make use of the (super)conformal higher-spin models
in $3d$ Minkowski and AdS (super)space to build topologically massive gauge
theories.

untrimmed video according to sentence queries. In this work, we present a new
paradigm named Explore-And-Match for NLVG that seamlessly unifies the strengths
of two streams of NLVG methods: proposal-free and proposal-based; the former
explores the search space to find time segments directly, and the latter
matches the predefined time segments with ground truths. To achieve this, we
formulate NLVG as a set prediction problem and design an end-to-end trainable
Language Video Transformer (LVTR) that can enjoy two favorable properties,
which are rich contextualization power and parallel decoding. We train LVTR
with two losses. First, temporal localization loss allows time segments of all
queries to regress targets (explore). Second, set guidance loss couples every
query with their respective target (match). To our surprise, we found that
training schedule shows divide-and-conquer-like pattern: time segments are
first diversified regardless of the target, then coupled with each target, and
fine-tuned to the target again. Moreover, LVTR is highly efficient and
effective: it infers faster than previous baselines (by 2X or more) and sets
competitive results on two NLVG benchmarks (ActivityCaptions and Charades-STA).

to generate mock Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest absorption skewers at
Cosmic Noon ($z\gtrsim 2$) from the matter-density field of $N$-body
simulations without running expensive hydrodynamical simulations. Motivated by
recent developments in 3D IGM tomography observations as well as matter density
field reconstruction techniques applied to galaxy redshift samples at $z\sim
2$, we examine the possibility of observationally testing FGPA by directly
examining the relationship between the Ly$\alpha$ transmission and the
underlying matter density field. Specifically, we analyze the EAGLE, Illustris,
IllustrisTNG and Nyx cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, that were run with
different codes and sub-grid models. While the FGPA is an excellent description
of the IGM in lower-density regions, the slope of the transmission-density
distribution at higher densities is significantly affected by feedback
processes causing the FGPA to break down in that regime. Even without added
feedback, we find significant deviations caused by hydrodynamical effects
arising from non-linear structure growth. We then proceed to make comparisons
using realistic mock data assuming the sightline sampling and spectral
properties of the recent CLAMATO survey, and find that it would be challenging
to discern between the FGPA and hydrodynamical models with current data sets.
However, the improved sightline sampling from future extremely large telescopes
or large volumes from multiplexed spectroscopic surveys such as Subaru PFS
should allow for stringent tests of the FGPA, and make it possible to detect
the effect of galaxy feedback on the IGM.

repeatedly exciting a frequency-tunable superconducting transmon and

decay, the protocol must be much shorter than magnon lifetime. Speeding up the
protocol by simply shortening the pulses leads to non-resonant leakage of
excitations to higher levels of the transmon accompanied by higher decoherence.
We discuss how to correct for such leakages by applying counter pulses to
de-excite these higher levels. In our protocol, states with a maximum magnon
occupation of up to $\sim9$ and average magnon number up to $\sim4$ can be
generated with fidelity $>0.75$.

the proposed coding scheme has two advantages compared to the nested linear

  Signals",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Human silhouette segmentation, which is originally defined in computer
vision, has achieved promising results for understanding human activities.
However, the physical limitation makes existing systems based on optical
cameras suffer from severe performance degradation under low illumination,
smoke, and/or opaque obstruction conditions. To overcome such limitations, in
this paper, we propose to utilize the radio signals, which can traverse
obstacles and are unaffected by the lighting conditions to achieve silhouette
segmentation. The proposed RFMask framework is composed of three modules. It
first transforms RF signals captured by millimeter wave radar on two planes
into spatial domain and suppress interference with the signal processing
module. Then, it locates human reflections on RF frames and extract features
from surrounding signals with human detection module. Finally, the extracted
features from RF frames are aggregated with an attention based mask generation
module. To verify our proposed framework, we collect a dataset containing
804,760 radio frames and 402,380 camera frames with human activities under
various scenes. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can
achieve impressive human silhouette segmentation even under the challenging
scenarios(such as low light and occlusion scenarios) where traditional
optical-camera-based methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first investigation towards segmenting human silhouette based on millimeter
wave signals. We hope that our work can serve as a baseline and inspire further
research that perform vision tasks with radio signals. The dataset and codes
will be made in public.

role in various stellar processes and influencing energy generation of stars,
stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. For a reliable reaction rate calculation
the low energy cross section of 14N(p,gamma)15O must be known with high
accuracy. Owing to the unmeasurable low cross sections, theoretical
calculations are unavoidable. High precision experimental cross section data
are needed in a wide energy range in order to provide the necessary basis for
low energy extrapolations. In the present work the total 14N(p,gamma)15O cross
section was measured with a method complementary to the available data sets.
The cross section was measured with activation, based on the detection of the
annihilation radiation following the beta+ decay of the reaction product 15O.
This method, which provides directly the astrophysically important total cross
section, was never used for the 14N(p,gamma)15O cross section measurement in
the studied energy range. The non-resonant cross section was measured between
550 keV and 1400 keV center-of-mass energies with total uncertainty of about
10%. The results were compared with literature data using an R-matrix analysis.
It is found that the cross sections measured in this work are in acceptable
agreement with the two recent measurements only if the weak transitions - not
measured in those works - are included. The present data set, being largely
independent from the other available data, can be used to constrain the
extrapolated cross sections to astrophysical energies and helps to make the
astrophysical model calculations more reliable.

strength {\lambda} of Ba$_{0.35}$K$_{0.65}$SbO$_3$ is strongly increased from

classify the people in different attributes. In this paper, we have presented a
novel method for classifying images using a pretrained transformer model. We
apply the pretrained transformer for the binary classification of facial images

trained to generate text and then fine-tuned to classify facial images. During
the finetuning process with images, most of the layers of GT-2 are frozen
during backpropagation and the model is frozen pretrained transformer (FPT).
The FPT acts as a universal image classifier, and this paper shows the
application of FPT on facial images. We also use our FPT on encrypted images
for classification. Our FPT shows high accuracy on both raw facial images and
encrypted images. We hypothesize the meta-learning capacity FPT gained because
of its large size and trained on a large size with theory and experiments. The
GPT-2 trained to generate a single word token at a time, through the
autoregressive process, forced to heavy-tail distribution. Then the FPT uses
the heavy-tail property as its meta-learning capacity for classifying images.
Our work shows one way to avoid bias during the machine classification of
images.The FPT encodes worldly knowledge because of the pretraining of one
text, which it uses during the classification. The statistical error of
classification is reduced because of the added context gained from the text.Our
paper shows the ethical dimension of using encrypted data for
classification.Criminal images are sensitive to share across the boundary but
encrypted largely evades ethical concern.FPT showing good classification
accuracy on encrypted images shows promise for further research on

to estimate buried utilities. When the GPR's detecting direction is
perpendicular to a pipeline, a hyperbolic characteristic would be formed on the
GPR B-scan image. However, in real-world applications, the direction of
pipelines on the existing pipeline map could be inaccurate, and it is hard to
ensure the moving direction of GPR to be actually perpendicular to underground
pipelines. In this paper, a novel model is proposed to estimate the direction
and radius of pipeline and revise the existing pipeline map from GPR B-scan
images. The model consists of two parts: GPR B-scan image processing and
Ellipse Iterative Inversion Algorithm (EIIA). Firstly, the GPR B-scan image is
processed with downward-opening point set extracted. The obtained point set is
then iteratively inverted to the elliptical cross section of the buried
pipeline, which is caused by the angle between the GPR's detecting direction
and the pipeline's direction. By minimizing the sum of the algebraic distances
from the extracted point set to the inverted ellipse, the most likely
pipeline's direction and radius are determined. Experiments on real-world
datasets are conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
method.

(ASR) system is important for reducing latency, which is essential for
interactive use cases. To this end, we propose a novel blockwise synchronous
decoding algorithm with a hybrid approach that combines endpoint prediction and
endpoint post-determination. In the endpoint prediction, we compute the
expectation of the number of tokens that are yet to be emitted in the encoder
features of the current blocks using the CTC posterior. Based on the
expectation value, the decoder predicts the endpoint to realize continuous
block synchronization, as a running stitch. Meanwhile, endpoint
post-determination probabilistically detects backward jump of the source-target
attention, which is caused by the misprediction of endpoints. Then it resumes
decoding by discarding those hypotheses, as back stitch. We combine these
methods into a hybrid approach, namely run-and-back stitch search, which
reduces the computational cost and latency. Evaluations of various ASR tasks
show the efficiency of our proposed decoding algorithm, which achieves a
latency reduction, for instance in the Librispeech test set from 1487 ms to 821
ms at the 90th percentile, while maintaining a high recognition accuracy.

However the spacetime representation of boosts is not standard, and contains a

behavior emerge as promising materials for realizing strong light-matter
interactions in the visible range and at ambient conditions. When these
materials are combined with metals, the energy confining ability of plasmon
polaritons in metals below the diffraction limit, allows for further enhancing
and tailoring the light-matter interaction, due to the formation of plexcitons
in hybrid metal-TMDC structures at the interface. Herein, we demonstrate that
the coupling between quasi-propagating plasmons in plasmonic crystals and
excitons in WSe2, provides a multi-oscillator playground for tailoring the band
structure of plasmonic crystal structures and results in emerging flat bands.
The cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and angle-resolved measurements combined
with the numerically calculated photonic band structure confirm a strong
exciton-plasmon coupling, leading to significant changes in the band diagram of
the hybrid lattice and the ability to tailor the band diagram via strong
coupling. The hybrid plexcitonic crystal structures investigated here sustain
optical waves with remarkably low group velocities. These results could be used
for designing tunable slow-light structures based on the strong-coupling effect
and pave the way toward plexcitonic topological photonic structures.

core components of Computer Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems
which is a subset of CALL. Studies on automated pronunciation error detection
began in the 1990s, but the development of fullfledged CAPTs has only
accelerated in the last decade due to an increase in computing power and
availability of mobile devices for recording speech required for pronunciation
analysis. Detecting Pronunciation errors is a hard problem to solve as there is
no formal definition of correct and incorrect pronunciation. As a result,
typically prosodic and phoneme errors such as phoneme substitution, insertion,
and deletion are detected. Also, it has been agreed upon that learning
pronunciation should focus on speaker intelligibility rather than sounding like
an L1 English speaker. Initially, methods were developed on posterior
likelihood called Good of Pronunciation using Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden
Markov Model and Deep Neural Network-Hidden Markov Model approaches. These are
complex systems to implement when compared with the recently proposed ASR based
End-to-End mispronunciations detection systems. The purpose of this research is
to create End-to-End (E2E) models using Connectionist Temporal Classification

wavelength, hence missing the binding of low-energy excitons. The reason is
that the model critically lacks the full three-dimensional topology of the
tube, being adapted from graphene theory. As ab inito calculations are limited
to small tubes, we develop a two-band model dielectric function based on the
plane-wave expansion of Bloch states and the exact truncated Coulomb cutoff
technique. We demonstrate that our -- computationally cheap -- approach
provides the correct screening for narrow-gap tubes of any size and chirality.
A striking result is that the screened interaction remains long-ranged even in
gapless tubes, as an effect of the microscopic local fields generated by the
electrons moving on the curved tube surface. As an application, we show that
the effective electron-electron force that is felt at distances relevant to
quantum transport experiments is super Coulombic.

by learning denoising representation of perturbed data in a teacher-student

to a teacher network to obtain corresponding representation. Then the same
utterance is perturbed and fed to a student network. The student network is
trained to output representation resembling that of the teacher. At the same
time, the teacher network is updated as moving average of student's weights
over training steps. In order to prevent representation collapse, we apply an
in-utterance contrastive loss as pre-training objective and impose position
randomization on the input to the teacher. SPIRAL achieves competitive or
better results compared to state-of-the-art speech pre-training method wav2vec
2.0, with significant reduction of training cost (80% for BASE model, 65% for
LARGE model). Furthermore, we address the problem of noise-robustness that is
critical to real-world speech applications. We propose multi-condition
pre-training by perturbing the student's input with various types of additive
noise. We demonstrate that multi-condition pre-trained SPIRAL models are more
robust to noisy speech (9.0% - 13.3% relative word error rate reduction on real
noisy test data), compared to applying multi-condition training solely in the
fine-tuning stage. Source code is available at

covariates, and (ii) a much larger unlabeled data set where only the covariates
are observed. We propose a family of semi-supervised estimators for the
response quantile(s) based on the two data sets, to improve the estimation
accuracy compared to the supervised estimator, i.e., the sample quantile from
the labeled data. These estimators use a flexible imputation strategy applied
to the estimating equation along with a debiasing step that allows for full
robustness against misspecification of the imputation model. Further, a
one-step update strategy is adopted to enable easy implementation of our method
and handle the complexity from the non-linear nature of the quantile estimating
equation. Under mild assumptions, our estimators are fully robust to the choice
of the nuisance imputation model, in the sense of always maintaining root-n
consistency and asymptotic normality, while having improved efficiency relative
to the supervised estimator. They also attain semi-parametric optimality if the
relation between the response and the covariates is correctly specified via the
imputation model. As an illustration of estimating the nuisance imputation
function, we consider kernel smoothing type estimators on lower dimensional and
possibly estimated transformations of the high dimensional covariates, and we
establish novel results on their uniform convergence rates in high dimensions,
involving responses indexed by a function class and usage of dimension
reduction techniques. These results may be of independent interest. Numerical
results on both simulated and real data confirm our semi-supervised approach's
improved performance, in terms of both estimation and inference.

duality and interpolation to the results for spaces $\mathsf{bmo}^c(\mathcal
M)$ and ${{\Lambda}^{{c}}_{\beta}}(\mathcal{M})$, but also allows us to find
the desired version of John-Nirenberg inequalities for spaces
$\mathcal{BMO}^c(\mathcal M)$ and ${\mathcal L^{{c}}_{\beta}}(\mathcal{M})$.
And thus we solve two open questions after \cite{ref5, ref3}. As an
application, we show that Lipschitz space is also the dual space of
noncommutative Hardy space defined via symmetric atoms. Finally, our results
for ${\mathcal L^{{c}}_{\beta}}(\mathcal{M})$ as well as the approach seem new
even going back to the classical setting.

units within the power network motivates the use of distributed schemes for
their control. Simultaneously, it raises two issues; achieving an optimal power
allocation among these units, and securing the privacy of the generation/demand
profiles. This study considers the problem of designing distributed optimality
schemes that preserve the privacy of the generation and controllable demand
units within the secondary frequency control timeframe. We propose a consensus
scheme that includes the generation/demand profiles within its dynamics,
keeping this information private when knowledge of its internal dynamics is not
available. However, the prosumption profiles may be inferred using knowledge of
its internal model. We resolve this by proposing a privacy-preserving scheme
which ensures that the generation/demand cannot be inferred from the
communicated signals. For both proposed schemes, we provide analytic stability,
optimality and privacy guarantees and show that the secondary frequency control
objectives are satisfied. The presented schemes are distributed, locally
verifiable and applicable to arbitrary network topologies. Our analytic results
are verified with simulations on a 140-bus system, where we demonstrate that
the proposed schemes offer enhanced privacy properties, enable an optimal power
allocation and preserve the stability of the power network.

existing knowledge buried in symbolic sequences -- e.g. explanations written in
hieroglyphic -- by autonomously learning to interpret them. In EL, the burden
of interpreting symbols is not left to humans or rigid human-coded compilers,
as done in Program Synthesis. Rather, EL calls for a learned interpreter, built
upon a limited collection of symbolic sequences paired with observations of
several phenomena. This interpreter can be used to make predictions on a novel
phenomenon given its explanation, and even to find that explanation using only
a handful of observations, like human scientists do. We formulate the EL
problem as a simple binary classification task, so that common end-to-end
approaches aligned with the dominant empiricist view of machine learning could,
in principle, solve it. To these models, we oppose Critical Rationalist
Networks (CRNs), which instead embrace a rationalist view on the acquisition of
knowledge. CRNs express several desired properties by construction, they are
truly explainable, can adjust their processing at test-time for harder
inferences, and can offer strong confidence guarantees on their predictions. As
a final contribution, we introduce Odeen, a basic EL environment that simulates
a small flatland-style universe full of phenomena to explain. Using Odeen as a
testbed, we show how CRNs outperform empiricist end-to-end approaches of
similar size and architecture (Transformers) in discovering explanations for

experiments in planet formation, evolution, and the emergence of life. This
raises the fascinating prospect of evaluating cosmic life on a statistical
basis. One key statistic is the occurrence rate of life-bearing worlds, $f_{\rm
L}$, the 'frequency of life' term in the famous Drake Equation. Measuring
$f_{\rm L}$ would give profound insight into how common life is and may help to
constrain origin-of-life theories. I propose $f_{\rm L}$ as the goal for the
DRAKE mission (Dedicated Research for Advancing Knowledge of Exobiology): a
transit spectroscopy survey of M-dwarf habitable zone terrestrial planets. I
investigate how the uncertainty on the observed value of $f_{\rm L}$ scales
with sample size. I determine that sampling error dominates over observational
error and that the uncertainty is a function of the observed $f_{\rm L}$ value.
I show that even small sample sizes can provide significant constraints on
$f_{\rm L}$, boding well for the transit spectroscopy approach. I perform a
feasibility study of the DRAKE mission using a nominal instrument design and
mission plan. Due to low observing efficiencies, DRAKE may need to be
incorporated into a wider-ranging deep-space or lunar observatory. A 50-planet
survey could constrain $f_{\rm L}$ to $\leq$ 0.06 (at 95% confidence) if the
sample $f_{\rm L}$ = 0, or 0.03-0.2 if the sample $f_{\rm L}$ = 0.1. This can
be achieved (on average) in 10 years using a 17-m telescope with an
unrestricted field-of-regard. DRAKE is a viable approach to attempting the

dichalcogenides (LD-TMD), as well as the reconstruction of their local density
of states (LDOS) from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments is of
fundamental interest and can be useful for advanced applications. Most of
existing models are either hardly applicable for the LD-TMD of complex shape
(e.g., those based on Simmons approach), or necessary for solving an
ill-defined integral equation to deconvolute the unknown LDOS (e.g., those
based on Tersoff approach). Using a serial expansion of Tersoff formulae, we
propose a flexible method how to reconstruct the LDOS from local
current-voltage characteristics measured in STM experiments. We established a
set of key physical parameters, which characterize the tunneling current of a
STM probe - sample contact and the sample LDOS expanded in Gaussian functions.
Using a direct variational method coupled with a probabilistic analysis, we
determine these parameters from the STM experiments for MoS2 nanoflakes with
different number of layers. The main result is the reconstruction of the LDOS
in a relatively wide energy range around a Fermi level, which allows insight in
the local band structure of LD-TMDs. The reconstructed LDOS reveals pronounced
size effects for the single-layer, bi-layer and three-layer MoS$_2$ nanoflakes,
which we relate with low dimensionality and strong bending/corrugation of the
nanoflakes. We hope that the proposed elaboration of the Tersoff approach
allowing LDOS reconstruction will be of urgent interest for quantitative
description of STM experiments, as well as useful for the microscopic physical
understanding of the surface, strain and bending contribution to LD-TMDs
electronic properties.

of Experiments (DOE) and machine learning (ML) as a methodology to collect and
analyze data on a specific industrial phenomenon. However, the literature shows
that the choice of the design for data collection and model for data analysis
is often not driven by statistical or algorithmic advantages, thus there is a
lack of studies which provide guidelines on what designs and ML models to
jointly use for data collection and analysis. This article discusses the choice
of design in relation to the ML model performances. A study is conducted that
considers 12 experimental designs, 7 families of predictive models, 7 test
functions that emulate physical processes, and 8 noise settings, both
homoscedastic and heteroscedastic. The results of the research can have an
immediate impact on the work of practitioners, providing guidelines for
practical applications of DOE and ML.

mainstream end-to-end approach for streaming automatic speech recognition
(ASR). To estimate the output distributions over subword units, RNN-T uses a
fully connected layer as the joint network to fuse the acoustic representations
extracted using the acoustic encoder with the text representations obtained
using the prediction network based on the previous subword units. In this
paper, we propose to use gating, bilinear pooling, and a combination of them in
the joint network to produce more expressive representations to feed into the
output layer. A regularisation method is also proposed to enable better
acoustic encoder training by reducing the gradients back-propagated into the
prediction network at the beginning of RNN-T training. Experimental results on
a multilingual ASR setting for voice search over nine languages show that the
joint use of the proposed methods can result in 4%--5% relative word error rate
reductions with only a few million extra parameters.

identify the vulnerability of a closed-loop system, consisting of a plant and a
supervisor, that might invite attacks. Here, the system vulnerability refers to
the existence of key observation sequences that could be exploited by a
specific smart sensor attack to cause damage infliction. We consider a
nondeterministic smart attack, i.e., there might exist more than one attack
choice over each received observation, and adopt our previously proposed
modeling framework, where such an attack is captured by a standard finite-state
automaton. For a given supervisor S and a smart sensor attack model A, another
smart attack model A' is called attack equivalent to A with respect to S, if
the resulting compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of the
supervisor S and attack model A', is control equivalent to the original
compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of S and A. Following the
spirit of supervisor reduction that relies on the concept of control
congruence, we will show that, this problem of synthesizing a reduced smart
attack model A' that is attack equivalent to A with respect to S, can be
transformed to a classical supervisor reduction problem, making all existing
synthesis tools available for supervisor reduction directly applicable to our
problem. A simplified and ideally minimum-state attack model can reveal all
necessary observation sequences for the attacker to be successful, thus,
reminds system designers to take necessary precautions in advance, which may
improve system resilience significantly. An example is presented to show the
effectiveness of our proposed attack model reduction technique to identify the
system vulnerability.

information-theoretic framework to a stochastic setting, by exploring the
effect of random user activity and by exploiting correlations in the activity
patterns of different users. In particular, the work studies the $K$-user
cache-aided broadcast channel with a limited number of cache states, and
explores the effect of cache state association strategies in the presence of
arbitrary user activity levels; a combination that strikes at the very core of
the coded caching problem and its crippling subpacketization bottleneck. We
first present a statistical analysis of the average worst-case delay
performance of such subpacketization-constrained (state-constrained) coded
caching networks, and provide computationally efficient performance bounds as
well as scaling laws for any arbitrary probability distribution of the
user-activity levels. The achieved performance is a result of a novel
user-to-cache state association algorithm that leverages the knowledge of
probabilistic user-activity levels.
  We then follow a data-driven approach that exploits the prior history on
user-activity levels and correlations, in order to predict interference
patterns, and thus better design the caching algorithm. This optimized strategy
is based on the principle that users that overlap more, interfere more, and
thus have higher priority to secure complementary cache states. This strategy
is proven here to be within a small constant factor from the optimal. Finally,
the above analysis is validated numerically using synthetic data following the
Pareto principle. To the best of our understanding, this is the first work that
seeks to exploit user-activity levels and correlations, in order to map future
interference and design optimized coded caching algorithms that better handle
this interference.

Age of
information (AoI) is used as the metric to characterize the information
freshness, defined as the time elapsed since the latest received status update
was generated. In error-prone wireless networks, prior studies indicated that
Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) does not help improve the average AoI
performance of single-hop networks, because sending a new packet always carries
the most up-to-date information (i.e., discarding the old packet). We believe
that this observation does not apply to two-hop networks. For example, when a
packet transmission fails in the second hop, although a new packet has more
recent information, it may require more time to be delivered (i.e., the
communication has to restart from the first hop), thus leading to a high AoI.
This paper analyzes the theoretical average AoI of two-hop networks with and
without ARQ. Specifically, we model the two schemes using Markov chains, from
which we derive the average AoI. Our theoretical and simulation results confirm
that, unlike single-hop networks, ARQ should be used in two-hop networks to
achieve lower average AoI. In particular, when ARQ is used, the successful
decoding probability of the second hop has a greater impact on the average AoI
than that of the first hop. Overall, our findings provide insight into the ARQ
design for two-hop timely status update systems.

populations of black hole (BH) binaries that can merge within the age of the
Universe. Although several formation channels of such binaries are known,
considerable theoretical uncertainties associated with each channel defeat the
robust prediction of how much each channel contributes to the total merger rate
density. Given that the time evolution of the merger rate density in some
channels is (exactly or nearly) independent of BH masses, clarifying this
feature from observational data will shed some light on the nature of BH
binaries. On the basis of this motivation, we formulate a methodology to
perform a statistical test of whether the mass distribution of BH mergers
evolves over time by hypothesis testing. Our statistical test requires neither
a priori specification of the mass distribution, which is largely uncertain,
nor that of the time dependence of merger rate. We then apply it to mock data
for some concrete shapes of the merger rate density and show that the proposed
method rejects/(does not reject) the null hypothesis correctly for a large
sample size. After this verification, the method is applied to a catalog of the
gravitational-wave events obtained during the LIGO-Virgo's third observing run.
We find that the selection bias degrades the effectiveness of our method for
the O3 catalog owing to the reduction in the number of and the maximum
redshifts of the merger events that we can explore. Within the range where the
method can be applied, there is no indication of the time evolution of the mass
distribution of merger rate density. This limitation will be eased in future
observations containing more events, and our hypothesis testing will help
determine whether the merger rate density evolves over time independently of BH
masses.

explore the internal representations and reasoning mechanisms of these models.
As a step towards addressing the underlying knowledge representation,
reasoning, and learning challenges, the architecture described in this paper
draws inspiration from research in cognitive systems. As a motivating example,
we consider an assistive robot trying to reduce clutter in any given scene by
reasoning about the occlusion of objects and stability of object configurations
in an image of the scene. In this context, our architecture incrementally
learns and revises a grounding of the spatial relations between objects and
uses this grounding to extract spatial information from input images.
Non-monotonic logical reasoning with this information and incomplete
commonsense domain knowledge is used to make decisions about stability and
occlusion. For images that cannot be processed by such reasoning, regions
relevant to the tasks at hand are automatically identified and used to train
deep network models to make the desired decisions. Image regions used to train
the deep networks are also used to incrementally acquire previously unknown
state constraints that are merged with the existing knowledge for subsequent
reasoning. Experimental evaluation performed using simulated and real-world
images indicates that in comparison with baselines based just on deep networks,
our architecture improves reliability of decision making and reduces the effort
involved in training data-driven deep network models.

low degree of automation, especially in industries that currently have a low
degree of digitalization, such as steel forging. Those industries typically
rely on heavy and old machinery such as large induction ovens that are mostly
controlled manually or using well-known recipes created by experts. However,
standard recipes may fail when unforeseen events happen, such as an unplanned
stop in production, which may lead to overheating and thus material degradation
during the forging process. In this paper, we develop a digital twin-based
optimization strategy for the heating process for a forging line to automate
the development of an optimal control policy that adjusts the power for the
heating coils in an induction oven based on temperature data observed from
pyrometers. We design a digital twin-based deep reinforcement learning (DTRL)
framework and train two different deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models for
the heating phase using a digital twin of the forging line. The twin is based
on a simulator that contains a heating transfer and movement model, which is
used as an environment for the DRL training. Our evaluation shows that both
models significantly reduce the temperature unevenness and can help to automate

probabilities between stops (or zones). This is a fast and accurate method,
recently studied in a VRP setting. Furthermore, we explore the use of machine
learning to infer how to best balance multiple objectives such as distance,
probability and penalties. Specifically, we cast the learning problem as a
structured output prediction problem, where training is done by repeatedly
calling the TSP solver. Another important aspect we consider is that for
last-mile delivery, every address is a potential client and hence the data is
very sparse. Hence, we propose a two-stage approach that first learns
preferences at the zone level in order to compute a zone routing; after which a
penalty-based TSP computes the stop routing. Results show that the zone
transition probability estimation performs well, and that the structured output
prediction learning can improve the results further. We hence showcase a
successful combination of both probability estimation and machine learning, all
the while using standard TSP solvers, both during learning and to compute the
final solution; this means the methodology is applicable to other, real-life,

problems that are characterized by time-varying parameters. These parameter
dynamics are either pre-specified or manipulable. At any given time instant the
decision policy -- that governs the sequential decisions -- along with all the
parameter values determines the cumulative cost incurred by the underlying SDM.
Thus, the objective is to determine the manipulable parameter dynamics as well

minimized at each time instant. To this end we develop a control-theoretic
framework to design the unknown parameter dynamics such that it locates and
tracks the optimal values of the parameters, and simultaneously determines the
time-varying optimal sequential decision policy. Our methodology builds upon a
Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) based framework that addresses the static

Lyapunov function. We show that under the resulting control law the parameters
asymptotically track the local optimal, the proposed control law is Lipschitz

shifted from the study of physical and medical issues to cognitive issues circa
the 1980s. The advent of computers brought with it the development of
human-computer interaction (HCI), which then expanded into the field of digital
interaction design and User Experience (UX). We ended up with the concept of
interactive cockpits, not because pilots interacted with mechanical things, but
because they interacted using pointing devices on computer displays. Since the
early 2000s, complexity and organizational issues gained prominence to the
point that complex systems design and management found itself center stage,
with the spotlight on the role of the human element and organizational setups.
Today, Human Systems Integration (HSI) is no longer only a single-agent
problem, but a multi-agent research field. Systems are systems of systems,
considered as representations of people and machines. They are made of
statically and dynamically articulated structures and functions. When they are
at work, they are living organisms that generate emerging functions and
structures that need to be considered in evolution (i.e., in their constant
redesign). This chapter will more specifically, focus on human factors such as
human-centered systemic representations, life critical systems, organizational
issues, complexity management, modeling and simulation, flexibility,
tangibility and autonomy. The discussion will be based on several examples in
civil aviation and air combat, as well as aerospace.

two additional hard constraints into the optimization step to ensure correct

scoped operations exist, they are either ad-hoc and unprincipled, or too
inconvenient for practical programming. This paper provides the best of both
worlds: a theoretically-founded model of scoped effects that is convenient for

locally finitely presentable category and a category of functorial algebras.
Using comparison functors between adjunctions, we show that our new model, an
existing indexed model, and a third approach that simulates scoped operations
in terms of algebraic ones have equal expressivity for handling scoped

induces fusion laws of handlers of scoped effects, which are useful for

With the development of Deep Learning (DL) technique, different kinds of

models require clean data set as the training labels, which are not always
available in medical imaging field. Inspiring by the similarities of each
channel's reconstructed image, we proposed a self-supervised learning based
PCCT image enhancement framework via multi-spectral channels (S2MS). In S2MS
framework, both the input and output labels are noisy images. Specifically, one

explanation provider and receiver have opposing interests and incentives, so
that the provider might manipulate the explanation for her own ends. We show
that this fundamental conflict cannot be resolved because of the high degree of

consequence, post-hoc explanation algorithms are unsuitable to achieve the
transparency objectives inherent to the legal norms. Instead, there is a need
to more explicitly discuss the objectives underlying ""explainability""

introduction of a novel numerical algorithm for the construction of the
piecewise linear control, that converges uniformly in time. Uniform convergence
is needed for many applications and it is achieved by approaching the problem
through the signature representation of the paths, which allows us to work with
the whole path simultaneously.

smart buildings over traditional buildings are becoming increasingly obvious.
Subsequently, its energy optimal scheduling and multi-objective optimization
have become more and more complex and need to be solved urgently. This paper
presents a novel method to optimize energy utilization in smart buildings.
Firstly, multiple transfer-retention ratio (TRR) parameters are added to the
evaluation of distributed renewable energy. Secondly, the normal-boundary
intersection (NBI) algorithm is improved by the adaptive weight sum, the adjust
uniform axes method, and Mahalanobis distance to form the improved
normal-boundary intersection (INBI) algorithm. The multi-objective optimization
problem in smart buildings is solved by the parameter TRR and INBI algorithm to
improve the regulation efficiency. In response to the needs of decision-makers
with evaluation indicators, the average deviation is reduced by 60% compared
with the previous case. Numerical examples show that the proposed method is
superior to the existing technologies in terms of three optimization
objectives. The objectives include 8.2% reduction in equipment costs, 7.6%
reduction in power supply costs, and 1.6% improvement in occupants' comfort.

the model to use. In this paper, we use Neural Relational Inference to learn
the optimal graph for the model. Our approach has several advantages: 1) a
Variational Auto Encoder structure allows for the graph to be dynamically
determined by the data, potentially changing through time; 2) the encoder

MeV energy range, which covers the peak of the $\nu F\nu$ spectrum of most
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Since its launch in 2008, Fermi/GBM has been the
primary instrument for analyzing GRBs in the energy range between $\approx$ 10
keV to $\approx$ 10 MeV. Herein, we show that SPI, covering a similar energy
range, can give equivalently constraining results for some parameters if we use
an advanced analysis method. Also, combining the data of both instruments
reduces the allowed parameter space in spectral fits. The main advantage of SPI
as compared to GBM is the energy resolution of $\approx$ 0.2\% at 1.3 MeV
compared to $\approx$ 10\% for GBM. Therefore, SPI is an ideal instrument to
precisely measure the curvature of the spectrum. This is important, as it has
been shown in recent years that physical models rather than heuristic functions
should be fit to GRB data to obtain better insights into their still unknown
emission mechanism, and the curvature of the peak is unique to the different
physical models. To fit physical models to SPI GRB data and get the maximal
amount of information from the data, we developed a new open source analysis
software {\tt PySPI}. We apply these new techniques to GRB 120711A in order to
validate and showcase {\tt PySPI}'s capabilities. We show that {\tt PySPI}
improves the analysis of SPI GRB data compared to the {\tt OSA} analysis. In
addition, we demonstrate that the GBM and the SPI data of this GRB can be
fitted well with a physical synchrotron model. This evinces that SPI can play
an important role in GRB spectral model fitting.

Optimization (System RBDO) and life-cycle cost or Risk Optimization (RO), there

impact of epistemic uncertainties. This paper investigates the fundamental
aspects of the problem, by addressing the optimal design of simple two-bar
active and passive redundant systems. Progressive collapse is objectively
addressed, differentiating consequences of direct collapse of statically
determinate structures, and progressive collapse of redundant, statically
indeterminate structures. It is well known that reliability of a structural
system also depends on nonstructural factors, or factors beyond structural
design, such as unanticipated loading, manufacturing quality, quality of
workmanship and human errors. These factors can be taken into account in an
encompassing risk analysis, which accounts for physical and epistemic
uncertainties, and which contributes a fixed latent failure probability to the
structural optimization problem. Results presented herein show that the latent
failure probability is the single most important parameter in determining
optimal solutions, in System RBDO and in RO solutions. When the latent failure
probability is smaller than target (System RBDO) or optimal (RO) failure
probabilities, there is an equivalence between redundant and non-redundant
(hyperstatic and isostatic) designs. However, when the latent reliability is
smaller than target or optimal reliabilities, optimal designs become
necessarily redundant (hyperstatic); as the only way to make system reliability
larger than the latent reliability is by making structural systems redundant.

fringes that appear when measuring certain spin states, which can then be
'erased' when measuring other spin states, are shown to be anomalous weak
values that depend on particular post-selection choices. By framing the choice
of spin measurement as a weak value of a certain weak measurement, it is then
made clear what physical claims can and cannot be made about what occurs in the
quantum eraser experiment. Specifically, claims about the choice of spin-state
`retrocausally' influencing the choice of slit(s) for the particles to travel
through are discredited, and a simple framework is presented for understanding
how the fringes arise and why they can be 'erased'.

including in children. The traditional method for processing acceleration data
uses cut points to define physical activity intensity, relying on calibration
studies that relate the magnitude of acceleration to energy expenditure.
However, these relationships do not generalise across diverse populations and
hence they must be parametrised for each subpopulation (e.g., age groups) which
is costly and makes studies across diverse populations and over time difficult.
A data driven approach that allows physical activity intensity states to emerge
from the data, without relying on parameters derived from external populations,
and offers a new perspective on this problem and potentially improved results.
We applied an unsupervised machine learning approach, namely a hidden semi
Markov model, to segment and cluster the accelerometer data recorded from 279
children (9 to 38 months old) with a diverse range of physical and
social-cognitive abilities (measured using the Paediatric Evaluation of
Disability Inventory). We benchmarked this analysis with the cut points
approach calculated using the best available thresholds for the population.
Time spent active as measured by this unsupervised approach correlated more
strongly with measures of the childs mobility, social-cognitive capacity,
independence, daily activity, and age than that measured using the cut points
approach. Unsupervised machine learning offers the potential to provide a more
sensitive, appropriate, and cost-effective approach to quantifying physical
activity behaviour in diverse populations, compared to the current cut points
approach. This, in turn, supports research that is more inclusive of diverse or

have been widely used to indicate the performance of telecom networks. Based on
the given KPIs, a large set of anomaly detection algorithms have been deployed
for detecting the unexpected network incidents. Generally, unsupervised anomaly
detection algorithms gain more popularity than the supervised ones, due to the
fact that labeling KPIs is extremely time- and resource-consuming, and
error-prone. However, those unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms often
suffer from excessive false alarms, especially in the presence of concept
drifts resulting from network re-configurations or maintenance. To tackle this
challenge and improve the overall performance of unsupervised anomaly detection
algorithms, we propose to use active learning to introduce and benefit from the
feedback of operators, who can verify the alarms (both false and true ones) and
label the corresponding KPIs with reasonable effort. Specifically, we develop
three query strategies to select the most informative and representative

Isolation Forest and optimally adjust the decision threshold, so as to
eventually improve the performance of detection model. The experiments with one

the Bloch-Gr\""uneisen theory for electron scattering by acoustic phonons. This
positive curvature has been previously observed in the in-plane resistivity of
high-conductivity layered delafossites such as PdCoO$_2$ and PtCoO$_2$. The
in-plane $\rho(T\to0) = 0.36~\mu\Omega$ cm of KCo$_2$As$_2$ is exceptionally
small for this class of compounds. The material also exhibits a nearly linear

100 K which is found from our first-principles calculations to arise from a
sharp peak in the electronic density of states just above the Fermi energy
$E_{\rm F}$. Heat capacity $C_{\rm p}(T)$ data at low $T$ yield an electronic
density of states $N(E_{\rm F})$ that is about 36% larger than predicted by the
first-principles theory. The $C_{\rm p}(T)$ data near room temperature suggest
the presence of excited optic vibration modes which may also be the source of
the positive curvature in $\rho(T)$. Our results show that KCo$_2$As$_2$

demand-side flexible resources to provide regulation services. However, finding
the best hourly regulation capacity offers for HVAC systems in a power market
ahead of time is challenging because they are affected by non-Gaussian
uncertainties from regulation signals. Moreover, since HVAC systems need to
frequently regulate their power according to regulation signals, numerous
thermodynamic constraints are introduced, leading to a huge computational
burden. This paper proposes a tractable chance-constrained model to address
these challenges. It first develops a temporal compression approach, in which
the extreme indoor temperatures in the operating hour are estimated and
restricted in the comfortable range so that the numerous thermodynamic
constraints can be compressed into only a few ones. Then, a novel
convexification method is proposed to handle the non-Gaussian uncertainties.
This method leverages the Gaussian mixture model to reformulate the chance
constraints with non-Gaussian uncertainties on the left-hand side into
deterministic non-convex forms. We further prove that these non-convex forms
can be approximately convexified by second-order cone constraints with marginal
optimality loss. Therefore, the proposed model can be efficiently solved with
guaranteed optimality. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the
superiority of the proposed method.

which satisfies a stochastic Fokker-Planck equation at superhorizon scales. The
corresponding noise and drift are computable, and depend on the cosmological
system under consideration. Our general formulas are applied to a variety of
cosmological scenarios, also considering cases seldom considered in the context
of stochastic inflation, and which are important for their observational
consequences. We start obtaining the expected expressions for noise and drift
in pure de Sitter and power-law inflation, also including a discussion of
effects of non-attractor phases. We then apply our methods to describe
scenarios with a transition from inflation to standard cosmological eras of
radiation and matter domination. We show how the interference between modes
flowing through the cosmological horizon, and modes spontaneously produced at

calculated by comparing action trajectories from different levels using the
edit distance, and difficulty is measured as how much exploration and expansion

demonstrate that our diversity metric is more robust to changes in level size

directly affect playability, instead of focusing on visual information. The

However, CT resolution and radiation dose are tightly entangled, highlighting
the importance of low-dose CT combined with sophisticated denoising algorithms.
Most data-driven denoising techniques are based on deep neural networks and,
therefore, contain hundreds of thousands of trainable parameters, making them
incomprehensible and prone to prediction failures. Developing understandable
and robust denoising algorithms achieving state-of-the-art performance helps to
minimize radiation dose while maintaining data integrity. This work presents an
open-source CT denoising framework based on the idea of bilateral filtering. We
propose a bilateral filter that can be incorporated into a deep learning
pipeline and optimized in a purely data-driven way by calculating the gradient
flow toward its hyperparameters and its input. Denoising in pure image-to-image
pipelines and across different domains such as raw detector data and
reconstructed volume, using a differentiable backprojection layer, is
demonstrated. Although only using three spatial parameters and one range
parameter per filter layer, the proposed denoising pipelines can compete with
deep state-of-the-art denoising architectures with several hundred thousand
parameters. Competitive denoising performance is achieved on x-ray microscope
bone data (0.7053 and 33.10) and the 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset

experimentally. Here we report the discovery of the charge-4e and charge-6e

transition-metal kagome lattice superconductor CsV3Sb5. We perform systematic
magneto-transport measurements and observe the quantization of the magnetic

Specifically, in the zero-resistance state below the temperature T_c^zero,
magnetoresistance oscillations with period h/2e for charge-2e superconductivity
are detected, as expected from the Little-Parks effect. We find that the h/2e
oscillations are suppressed when the temperature is increased above T_c^zero

indicating the emergence of charge-4e superconductivity. Increasing the

performing extensive inelastic neutron scattering measurements, we obtained the

Network (CNN)-based approaches for denoising and interference mitigation yield
promising results for radar processing in terms of performance. Regarding

This quantization results in reduced memory requirements for model storage and
during inference. We compare models with fixed and learned bit-widths and
contrast two different methodologies for training quantized CNNs, i.e. the
straight-through gradient estimator and training distributions over discrete
weights. We illustrate the importance of structurally small real-valued base
models for quantization and show that learned bit-widths yield the smallest

real-valued baseline. Due to practical reasons, however, we recommend the use
of 8 bits for weights and activations, which results in models that require

entropy map in the neural network approximation to preserve the structure of

The first approach approximates the map between moments and the minimal entropy
of the moment system and is convex by design. The second approach approximates
the map between moments and Lagrange multipliers of the dual of the minimal
entropy optimization problem, which present the gradients of the entropy with
respect to the moments, and is enforced to be monotonic by introduction of a
penalty function. We derive an error bound for the generalization gap of convex
neural networks which are trained in Sobolev norm and use the results to

utility in covering larger areas with fewer support personnel. A variety of
missions, such as search and rescue, assessing structural damage, and
monitoring forest fires, floods, and chemical spills, can be supported simply
by deploying the appropriate AI models. However, adoption by
resource-constrained groups, such as local municipalities, regulatory agencies,
and researchers, has been hampered by the lack of a cost-effective,
readily-accessible baseline platform that can be adapted to their unique
missions. To fill this gap, we have developed the free and open-source ADAPT
multi-mission payload for deploying real-time AI and computer vision onboard a
sUAS during local and beyond-line-of-site missions. We have emphasized a
modular design with low-cost, readily-available components, open-source
software, and thorough documentation (https://kitware.github.io/adapt/). The
system integrates an inertial navigation system, high-resolution color camera,
computer, and wireless downlink to process imagery and broadcast georegistered
analytics back to a ground station. Our goal is to make it easy for the HADR
community to build their own copies of the ADAPT payload and leverage the
thousands of hours of engineering we have devoted to developing and testing. In
this paper, we detail the development and testing of the ADAPT payload. We
demonstrate the example mission of real-time, in-flight ice segmentation to
monitor river ice state and provide timely predictions of catastrophic flooding
events. We deploy a novel active learning workflow to annotate river ice
imagery, train a real-time deep neural network for ice segmentation, and
demonstrate operation in the field.

of tasks such as object recognition, image segmentation and interactive speech
systems. CNNs require large amounts of computing resources because
ofcomputationally intensive convolution layers. Fast convolution algorithms
such as Winograd convolution can greatly reduce the computational cost of these
layers at a cost of poor numeric properties, such that greater savings in
computation exponentially increase floating point errors.
  A defining feature of each Winograd convolution algorithm is a set of
real-value points where polynomials are sampled. The choice of points impacts
the numeric accuracy of the algorithm, but the optimal set of points for small
convolutions remains unknown. Existing work considers only small integers and
simple fractions as candidate points. In this work, we propose a novel approach
to point selection using points of the form {-1/c , -c, c, 1/c } using the full
range of real-valued numbers for c. We show that groups of this form cause
cancellations in the Winograd transform matrices that reduce numeric error. We
find empirically that the error for different values of c forms a rough curve
across the range of real-value numbers helping to localize the values of c that
reduce error and that lower errors can be achieved with non-obvious real-valued
evaluation points instead of integers or simple fractions. We study a range of
sizes for small convolutions and achieve reduction in error ranging from 2% to
around 59% for both 1D and 2D convolution. Furthermore, we identify patterns in
cases when we select a subset of our proposed points which will always lead to
a lower error. Finally we implement a complete Winograd convolution layer and
use it to run deep convolution neural networks on real datasets and show that
our proposed points reduce error, ranging from 22% to 63%.

Some applications require any decomposition that is optimal w.r.t. some
property such as number of paths, robustness, or length. Many bioinformatic
applications require a specific decomposition where the paths correspond to
some underlying data that generated the flow. For real inputs, no optimization
criteria guarantees to uniquely identify the correct decomposition. Therefore,
we propose to report safe paths, i.e., subpaths of at least one path in every
flow decomposition.
  Ma, Zheng, and Kingsford [WABI 2020] addressed the existence of multiple
optimal solutions in a probabilistic framework, i.e., non-identifiability.
Later [RECOMB 2021], they gave a quadratic-time algorithm based on a global
criterion for solving a problem called AND-Quant, which generalizes the problem
of reporting whether a given path is safe.
  We give the first local characterization of safe paths for flow
decompositions in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), leading to a practical
algorithm for finding the complete set of safe paths. We evaluated our
algorithms against the trivial safe algorithms (unitigs, extended unitigs) and
the popularly used heuristic (greedy-width) for flow decomposition on RNA
transcripts datasets. Despite maintaining perfect precision our algorithm
reports significantly higher coverage ($\approx 50\%$ more) than trivial safe
algorithms. The greedy-width algorithm though reporting a better coverage, has
significantly lower precision on complex graphs. Overall, our algorithm
outperforms (by $\approx 20\%$) greedy-width on a unified metric (F-Score) when
the dataset has significant number of complex graphs. Moreover, it has superior
time ($3-5\times$) and space efficiency ($1.2-2.2\times$), resulting in a
better and more practical approach for bioinformatics applications of flow

a set of modifications proposed for the synthesizer based on Tacotron 2.
Moreover, effective zero-shot speaker adaptation is achieved by conditioning
both the synthesizer and vocoder on a speaker encoder that has been pretrained

consistency and ability to synthesize long utterances, and conclude that the

information available to the team members during the play, which makes the
equilibrium computation problem hard even with zero-sum payoffs. The algorithms
available in the literature work with implicit representations of the strategy
space and mainly resort to Linear Programming and column generation techniques
to enlarge incrementally the strategy space. Such representations prevent the
adoption of standard tools such as abstraction generation, game solving, and
subgame solving, which demonstrated to be crucial when solving huge, real-world
two-player zero-sum games. Differently from these works, we answer the question
of whether there is any suitable game representation enabling the adoption of
those tools. In particular, our algorithms convert a sequential team game with
adversaries to a classical two-player zero-sum game. In this converted game,
the team is transformed into a single coordinator player who only knows
information common to the whole team and prescribes to the players an action
for any possible private state. Interestingly, we show that our game is more
expressive than the original extensive-form game as any state/action
abstraction of the extensive-form game can be captured by our representation,
while the reverse does not hold. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, the
resulting Public Team game may be exponentially larger than the original one.
To limit this explosion, we provide three algorithms, each returning an
information-lossless abstraction that dramatically reduces the size of the
tree. These abstractions can be produced without generating the original game
tree. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed approach by presenting
experimental results on Kuhn and Leduc Poker games, obtained by applying

postponed and even canceled to protect musicians and audience. Orchestral
ensembles face a particular challenge of contamination because they are
personnel heavy and instrumentally diverse. A chief concern is whether wind
instruments are vectors of contamination through aerosol dispersion. This
study, made possible by the participation of members of the Philadelphia
Orchestra, brings insight on the modes of production and early life of aerosols
of human origin emitted by wind instruments. We find that these instruments
produce aerosol levels that are comparable to normal speech in quantity and
size distribution. However, the exit jet flow speeds are much lower than
violent expiratory events (coughing, sneezing). For most wind instruments, the
flow decays to background indoor-air levels at approximately 2 meters away from
the instrument's opening. Long range aerosol dispersion is thus via ambient air
currents.

switches after a certain amount of erosion. In the first case there are only
two model unknowns, the solubility and mass transfer coefficient, in the second

the upward sloping smiles observed in the market. We use the exact solution for
a certain inhomogeneous fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation to build a

Hoyle state in particular $-$ is crucial for our understanding of both the
astrophysically important $3\alpha$ reaction and of $\alpha$-particle
clustering. Multiple theoretical models have predicted a breathing mode of the
Hoyle State at $E_{x} \approx 9$ MeV, corresponding to a radial in-phase
oscillation of the underlying $\alpha$ clusters. The $\mathrm{^{12}C}(\alpha,
\alpha^{\prime})\mathrm{^{12}C}$ and $\mathrm{^{14}C}(p, t)\mathrm{^{12}C}$
reactions were employed to populate states in $^{12}$C in order to search for
this predicted breathing mode. A self-consistent, simultaneous analysis of the
inclusive spectra with R-matrix lineshapes, together with angular distributions
of charged-particle decay, yielded clear evidence for excess monopole strength
at $E_{x} \approx 9$ MeV which is highly collective. Reproduction of the
experimentally observed inclusive yields using a fit, with consistent
population ratios for the various broad states, required an additional source
of monopole strength. The interpretation of this additional monopole resonance
as the breathing-mode excitation of the Hoyle state would provide evidence
supporting a $\mathcal{D}_{3h}$ symmetry for the Hoyle state itself. The excess
monopole strength may complicate analysis of the properties of the Hoyle state,
modifying the temperature dependence of the $3\alpha$ rate at $T_{9} \gtrsim 2$
and ultimately, the predicted nucleosynthesis in explosive stars.

approximate nonlinear Vlasov solutions. The low rank approach is based on our
earlier work (arxiv: 2106.08834). It takes advantage of the fact that the
differential operators in the Vlasov equation are tensor friendly, based on
which we propose to dynamically and adaptively build up low rank solution basis
by adding new basis functions from discretization of the differential equation,
and removing basis from a singular value decomposition (SVD)-type truncation
procedure. For the discretization, we adopt a high order finite difference
spatial discretization together with a second order strong stability preserving
multi-step time discretization.
  While the SVD truncation will remove the redundancy in representing the high
dimensional Vlasov solution, it will destroy the conservation properties of the
associated full conservative scheme. In this paper, we develop a conservative
truncation procedure with conservation of mass, momentum and kinetic energy
densities. The conservative truncation is achieved by an orthogonal projection
onto a subspace spanned by $1$, $v$ and $v^2$ in the velocity space associated
with a weighted inner product. Then the algorithm performs a weighted SVD
truncation of the remainder, which involves a scaling, followed by the standard
SVD truncation and rescaling back. The algorithm is further developed in high
dimensions with hierarchical Tucker tensor decomposition of high dimensional
Vlasov solutions, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. An extensive set of
nonlinear Vlasov examples are performed to show the effectiveness and
conservation property of proposed conservative low rank approach. Comparison is
performed against the non-conservative low rank tensor approach on conservation
history of mass, momentum and energy.

systems are subject to various uncertainties rendering these assumptions
impractical. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient computation
offloading problem by relaxing those common assumptions and considering
intrinsic uncertainties in the network. Specifically, we minimize the
worst-case expected energy consumption of a local device when executing a
time-critical application modeled as a directed acyclic graph. We employ the
extreme value theory to bound the occurrence probability of uncertain events.
To solve the formulated problem, we develop an $\epsilon$-bounded approximation
algorithm based on column generation. The proposed algorithm can efficiently
identify a feasible solution that is less than (1+$\epsilon$) of the optimal
one. We implement the proposed scheme on an Android smartphone and conduct
extensive experiments using a real-world application. Experiment results
corroborate that it will lead to lower energy consumption for the client device

deorbiting of a satellite in the formation. The remaining spacecraft have to
reconfigure to form again an equidistant formation. To achieve this goal, we
consider two decentralized strategies that rely on different sets of

spacecraft, i.e. position and velocity, while in the second decentralized
strategy with with information sharing, the entire planned nominal trajectory

typically requires an intracavity mechanism that discriminates between single

Moreover, known mode-locking schemes do not guarantee phase stability of the
carrier wave. Here we theoretically propose that injecting a detuned signal
seamlessly leads to mode-locking in fiber lasers. We show that phase-locked
pulses, akin to cavity solitons, exist in a wide range of parameters. In that
regime the laser behaves as a passive resonator due to the non-instantaneous

We propose to generate textures for input target 3D meshes driven by the

challenging because the underlying shape, size, and layout of the urban

and adversarial training of a neural architecture designed for unpaired
image-to-texture translation. The generated textures are stored in a texture
atlas applied to the target 3D mesh geometry. To promote texture consistency,
PUT employs an iterative procedure in which texture synthesis is conditioned on

microstructure evolution representing grain reorientation in one space
dimension are demonstrated. The different shapes of the energy density
functions representing a common data set are shown to result in different
overall microstructural evolution of the system. Mathematically, the

feature of solutions that can be identified with grain boundaries, as well as

asymptotic behaviour in the far-future. The author discusses whether a Big Rip
singularity could be reached in the future. Working in the context of general
relativity, it is argued that the Big Rip singularity could be avoided due to
the gravitational Schwinger pair-production, even if no other particle-creating
contribution takes place. In this model, the universe is described in its
far-future by a state of a constant but large Hubble rate and energy density,
as well as of a constant but low horizon entropy. Similar conditions existed at
the beginning of the universe. Therefore, according to this analysis, not only
the Big Rip singularity could be avoided in the far-future but also the
universe could asymptotically be led to a new inflationary phase, after which
more and more universes could be created.

variables that together encode a structured object -- a path in a graph, an

makes learning hard and requires vast amounts of labeled data. Different
approaches leverage alternate sources of supervision. One approach -- entropy
regularization -- posits that decision boundaries should lie in low-probability
regions. It extracts supervision from unlabeled examples, but remains agnostic
to the structure of the output space. Conversely, neuro-symbolic approaches
exploit the knowledge that not every prediction corresponds to a valid
structure in the output space. Yet, they does not further restrict the learned
output distribution. This paper introduces a framework that unifies both
approaches. We propose a loss, neuro-symbolic entropy regularization, that
encourages the model to confidently predict a valid object. It is obtained by
restricting entropy regularization to the distribution over only valid
structures. This loss is efficiently computed when the output constraint is
expressed as a tractable logic circuit. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with
other neuro-symbolic losses that eliminate invalid predictions. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach on a series of semi-supervised and
fully-supervised structured-prediction experiments, where we find that it leads
to models whose predictions are more accurate and more likely to be valid.

structured data. Subgraph matching algorithms enumerate all isomorphic
embeddings of a query graph q in a data graph G. An important branch of
matching algorithms exploit the backtracking search approach which recursively
extends intermediate results following a matching order of query vertices. It
has been shown that the matching order plays a critical role in time efficiency
of these backtracking based subgraph matching algorithms. In recent years, many
advanced techniques for query vertex ordering (i.e., matching order generation)
have been proposed to reduce the unpromising intermediate results according to
the preset heuristic rules. In this paper, for the first time we apply the
Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) techniques to
generate the high-quality matching order for subgraph matching algorithms.
Instead of using the fixed heuristics to generate the matching order, our model
could capture and make full use of the graph information, and thus determine
the query vertex order with the adaptive learning-based rule that could
significantly reduces the number of redundant enumerations. With the help of
the reinforcement learning framework, our model is able to consider the
long-term benefits rather than only consider the local information at current
ordering step.Extensive experiments on six real-life data graphs demonstrate
that our proposed matching order generation technique could reduce up to two
orders of magnitude of query processing time compared to the state-of-the-art

various tasks without mutual interference. An effective way to reduce mutual
interference can be found in sparsity and selectivity of neurons. According to
Aljundi et al. and Hadsell et al., imposing sparsity at the representational
level is advantageous for continual learning because sparse neuronal
activations encourage less overlap between parameters, resulting in less
interference. Similarly, highly selective neural networks are likely to induce
less interference since particular response in neurons will reduce the chance
of overlap with other parameters. Considering that the human brain performs
continual learning over the lifespan, finding conditions where sparsity and
selectivity naturally arises may provide insight for understanding how the
brain functions. This paper investigates various conditions that naturally
increase sparsity and selectivity in a neural network. This paper tested
different optimizers with Hoyer's sparsity metric and CCMAS selectivity metric

the natural occurrence of sparsity and selectivity concerning various

Neighbor-Interaction based CTR prediction involves the local neighborhood of

identified by behavioral scientists, to more than 200 at present. This article
identifies the 10 most important behavioral biases for project management.
First, we argue it is a mistake to equate behavioral bias with cognitive bias,
as is common. Cognitive bias is half the story; political bias the other half.
Second, we list the top 10 behavioral biases in project management: (1)
strategic misrepresentation, (2) optimism bias, (3) uniqueness bias, (4) the
planning fallacy, (5) overconfidence bias, (6) hindsight bias, (7) availability
bias, (8) the base rate fallacy, (9) anchoring, and (10) escalation of
commitment. Each bias is defined, and its impacts on project management are
explained, with examples. Third, base rate neglect is identified as a primary
reason that projects underperform. This is supported by presentation of the
most comprehensive set of base rates that exist in project management
scholarship, from 2,062 projects. Finally, recent findings of power law
outcomes in project performance are identified as a possible first stage in
discovering a general theory of project management, with more fundamental and
more scientific explanations of project outcomes than found in conventional
theory.

  Evaluation Framework for Text Anonymization",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a novel benchmark and associated evaluation metrics for assessing
the performance of text anonymization methods. Text anonymization, defined as
the task of editing a text document to prevent the disclosure of personal
information, currently suffers from a shortage of privacy-oriented annotated
text resources, making it difficult to properly evaluate the level of privacy
protection offered by various anonymization methods. This paper presents TAB
(Text Anonymization Benchmark), a new, open-source annotated corpus developed
to address this shortage. The corpus comprises 1,268 English-language court
cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) enriched with
comprehensive annotations about the personal information appearing in each
document, including their semantic category, identifier type, confidential
attributes, and co-reference relations. Compared to previous work, the TAB
corpus is designed to go beyond traditional de-identification (which is limited
to the detection of predefined semantic categories), and explicitly marks which
text spans ought to be masked in order to conceal the identity of the person to
be protected. Along with presenting the corpus and its annotation layers, we
also propose a set of evaluation metrics that are specifically tailored towards
measuring the performance of text anonymization, both in terms of privacy
protection and utility preservation. We illustrate the use of the benchmark and
the proposed metrics by assessing the empirical performance of several baseline
text anonymization models. The full corpus along with its privacy-oriented
annotation guidelines, evaluation scripts and baseline models are available on:

This mechanism has inspired several approaches to decentralized multi-robot
coordination. However, in this paper, we show that pheromone trails are a
fragile mechanism for coordination, and can be sabotaged to starve the colony.
We introduce detractors: malicious agents that leave a misleading, but
indistinguishable, trail of food pheromone to distract and trap cooperator ants
in the nest. We analyze the effectiveness of detractors with respect to
parameters such as evaporation rate of misleading pheromone and fraction of
detractors in the colony. In addition, we propose a countermeasure to this
attack by introducing a new type of pheromone: the cautionary pheromone.
Cooperator ants secrete this type of pheromone atop existing food trails as a
warning. When the cautionary pheromone intensity exceeds the food pheromone
intensity, cooperator ants ignore overlapping food pheromone. We show that,
despite its simplicity, this defense mechanism can limit, but not nullify, the
effect of detractors. Ultimately, our work shows that pheromone-based
coordination, while effective, is also fragile.

the number of clusters is 7, the output result distribution interval of the
K-means clustering algorithm is 4 days, and when the number of clusters is 10,
the output result distribution interval of the K-means clustering algorithm is

structure must be simple. Thus, in this work, a portable elbow exoskeleton is
developed using SolidWorks to incorporate a Twisted Strings Actuator (TSA) to
aid in upper-limb rehabilitation and to provide an alternative for those with
compromised limbs to recuperate. Experiments are conducted to identify the
optimal value for building a more flexible elbow exoskeleton prototype by
analyzing stress, strain conditions, torque, forces, and strings. Preliminary
computational findings reveal that for the proposed intended prototype, a
string length of.033 m and a torque value ranging from 1.5 Nm to 3 Nm are
optimal.
