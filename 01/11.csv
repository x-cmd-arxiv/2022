Bayesian BeyondPlanck CMB analysis pipeline as applied to the Planck LFI
measurements. As a preparatory step, we first apply three corrections to the
nominal LFI bandpass profiles including removal of a known systematic effect in
the ground measuring equipment at 61 GHz; smoothing of standing wave ripples;
and edge regularization. The main net impact of these modifications is an
overall shift in the 70 GHz bandpass of +0.6 GHz; we argue that any analysis of
LFI data products, either from Planck or BeyondPlanck, should use these new
bandpasses. In addition, we fit a single free bandpass parameter for each
radiometer of the form $\Delta_i = \Delta_0 + \delta_i$, where $\Delta_0$
represents an absolute frequency shift per frequency band and $\delta_i$ is a
relative shift per detector. The absolute correction is only fitted at 30 GHz
with a full $\chi^2$-based likelihood, resulting in a correction of
$\Delta_{30}=0.24\pm0.03\,$GHz. The relative corrections are fitted using a
spurious map approach, fundamentally similar to the method pioneered by the
WMAP team, but without introducing many additional degrees of freedom. All
bandpass parameters are sampled using a standard Metropolis sampler within the
main BeyondPlanck Gibbs chain, and bandpass uncertainties are thus propagated
to all other data products in the analysis. In total, we find that our bandpass
model significantly reduces leakage effects. For beam leakage corrections, we
adopt the official Planck LFI beam estimates without additional degrees of
freedom, and only marginalize over the underlying sky model. We note that this
is the first time leakage from beam mismatch has been included for Planck LFI
maps.

system, with frequencies in the 100 Hz regime, make corresponding laboratory
experiments with full control over cause and effect of great importance.
Dynamic measurements of gravitation in the laboratory have to date been scarce,
due to difficulties in assessing non-gravitational crosstalk and the
intrinsically weak nature of gravitational forces. In fact, fully controlled
quantitative experiments have so far been limited to frequencies in the mHz
regime. New experiments in gravity might also yield new physics, thereby
opening avenues towards a theory that explains all of physics within one
coherent framework. Here we introduce a new, fully-characterized experiment at
three orders of magnitude higher frequencies. It allows experimenters to
quantitatively determine the dynamic gravitational interaction between two
parallel beams vibrating at 42 Hz in bending motion. The large amplitude
vibration of the transmitter beam produces gravitationally-induced motion with
amplitudes up to 1E-11 m of the resonant detector beam. The reliable
measurement with sub-pm displacement resolution is made possible by a set-up
which combines acoustical, mechanical and electrical isolation, a
temperature-stable environment, heterodyne laser interferometry and lock-in
detection. The interaction is quantitatively modelled based on Newton's theory.
Our initial results agree with the theory to within about three percent in
amplitude. Based on a power balance analysis, we determined the near-field
gravitational energy flow from the transmitter to the detector to be 2.5 E-20
J/s, and to decay with distance as d-4. We expect our experiment to make
significant progress in directions where current experimental evidence for
dynamic gravitation is limited, such as the dynamic determination of G,
inverse-square law, and gravitational shielding.

but requires appropriate dispatch models to be economically coordinated with
other generation resources in bulk power systems. This paper analyzes how
different dispatch models and bidding strategies would affect the utilization
of storage with various durations in deregulated power systems. We use a
dynamic programming model to calculate the operation opportunity value of
storage from price predictions, and use the opportunity value result as a base
for designing market bids. We compare two market bidding and dispatch models in
single-period economic dispatch: one without state of charge (SoC) constraints
and one with SoC constraints. We test the two storage dispatch models, combined
with different price predictions and storage durations, using historical
real-time price data from New York Independent System Operator. We compare the
utilization rate with respect to results from perfect price forecast cases. Our
result shows that while price prediction accuracy is critical for short
duration storage with a less than four hours capacity, storage with a duration
longer than twelve hours can easily achieve a utilization rate higher than 80\%
even with naive day-ahead price predictions. Modeling storage bids as dependent
of SoC in single-period real-time dispatch will provide around 5% of
improvement in storage utilization over all duration cases and bidding
strategies, and higher renewable share will likely improve storage utilization
rate due to higher occurrence of negative prices.

  their impact on source characterization","PhD thesis",,,,"gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the last five years, gravitational-wave astronomy has gone from a purely
theoretical field into a thriving experimental science. Many gravitational-wave
signals, emitted by stellar-mass binary black holes and binary neutron stars,
have been detected, and many more are expected in the future. The observation
of the gravitational-wave signals from these systems, and the characterization
of their sources, heavily relies on the precise models for the emitted
gravitational waveforms. In this thesis, I present an updated version of the
waveform models for spinning binary black holes within the effective-one-body
formalism. The novelty of the waveform models presented in this work is the
inclusion of beyond-quadupolar terms in the waveforms emitted by spinning
binary black holes. I first construct the model in the simplified case of black
holes with spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum of the binary, then
I extend it to the case of generic spin orientations. The measurement of the
source properties of a binary system emitting gravitational waves requires to
compute $\mathcal{O}(10^7-10^9)$ different waveforms. Since the waveform models
mentioned before can require $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$s to generate a single
waveform, they can be difficult to use in data-analysis studies. To overcome
this obstacle, I use the reduced-order-modeling technique to develop a faster
version of the waveform model for black holes with spins aligned to the orbital
angular momentum of the binary. The waveform models developed in this thesis
have been used by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations for the inference of the
source parameters of the gravitational-wave signals detected during the second
and third observing runs (O2 and O3) of the LIGO and Virgo detectors. Here, I
present a study on the source properties of the signals GW170729 and GW190412,

shed light on the process that perturbed the filament where the Class 0 IRAS4
protostars lie. We use new IRAM-NOEMA observations of SiO and CH3OH, both known
to trace violent events as shocks, toward IRAS 4A as part of the Large Program
Seeds Of Life in Space (SOLIS). We detected three parallel elongated ($>$6000
au) structures, called fingers, with narrow line profiles (~1.5 $km s^{-1}$)
peaked at the cloud systemic velocity, tracing gas with high density (5-20
$10^5 cm^{-3}$) and high temperature (80-160 K). They are chemically different,
with the northern finger traced by both SiO and CH3OH ([CH3OH]/[SiO]~160-300),
while the other two only by SiO ([CH3OH]/[SiO]$<$ 40). Among various
possibilities, a train of three shocks, distanced by $>$5000 yr, would be
consistent with the observations if a substantial fraction of silicon, frozen
onto the grain mantles, is released by the shocks.We suggest that the shock
train is due to an expanding gas bubble, coming behind NGC 1333 from the
southwest and clashing against the filament, where IRAS 4A lies. Finally, we
propose a solution to the two-decades long debate on the nature and origin of
the widespread narrow SiO emission observed in the south part of NGC 1333,
namely that it is due to unresolved trains of shocks.

possibility of taking several non-standard processes such as atomic diffusion
into account. Even if the effect of gravitational settling is considered a
standard ingredient in stellar modelling today, this is not the case for
radiative accelerations. The specific treatment of atomic diffusion along with
the radiative accelerations has never been compared with other stellar
evolution codes. Benchmarking these codes is important because improved
accuracy is required in order to analyse data from present and future space
missions, such as the \textit{Kepler}, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite
(TESS), and PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) missions.
  The aim of this paper is to compare MESA models including atomic diffusion
(with radiative accelerations) with models computed with the
Montreal/Montpellier stellar evolution code and with the Code d'Evolution
Stellaire Adaptatif et Modulaire (CESTAM). Additionally, we assess the impact
of some MESA options related to atomic diffusion.
  We calculated atomic diffusion, including radiative accelerations, following
the abundance profiles of 14 elements with MESA models. This was then compared
with 1.1 and 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ models computed with the Montreal/Montpellier and
CESTAM codes. Various tests of MESA options for atomic diffusion were also
carried out by varying only one of them at a time.
  We find that the abundance profiles of the considered elements in the MESA
models compare rather well with the models computed with the two other codes
when atomic diffusion options are carefully set. We also show that some options
in MESA are crucial for a proper treatment of atomic diffusion.

and Billinge (2018) arXiv:1805.10342 [cond-mat]]. It is demonstrated on a fiber
textured polycrystalline Pt thin film. The approach uses 3D PDF methods to
reconstruct the orientation distribution function (ODF) of the powder
crystallites from a set of diffraction patterns taken at different tilt angles
of the substrate with respect to the incident beam directly from the 3D PDF of
the sample. A real space equivalent of the reciprocal space pole figure is
defined in terms of interatomic vectors in the PDF and computed for various
interatomic vectors in the Pt film. Further, it is shown how a valid isotropic
PDF may be obtained from a weighted average over the tilt series, and the
measurement conditions for the best approximant to the isotropic PDF from a
single exposure, which for the case of the fiber textured film was in a nearly
grazing incidence orientation of around 10 degrees. Finally, we describe an
open source Python software package, Fourigui, that may be used to help in
studies of texture from 3D reciprocal space data, and indeed for Fourier
transforming and visualizing 3D PDF data in general.

reached a threshold up to a given observation time, plays a crucial role in the
theory of random processes. It quantifies the kinetics of processes as varied
as phase ordering, reaction diffusion or interface relaxation dynamics. The
fact that persistence can decay algebraically with time with non trivial
exponents has triggered a number of experimental and theoretical studies.
However, general analytical methods to calculate persistence exponents cannot
be applied to the ubiquitous case of non-Markovian systems relaxing transiently
after an imposed initial perturbation. Here, we introduce a theoretical
framework that enables the non perturbative determination of persistence
exponents of $d$-dimensional Gaussian non-Markovian processes with general non
stationary dynamics relaxing to a steady state after an initial perturbation.
Two prototypical classes of situations are analyzed: either the system is
subjected to a temperature quench at initial time, or its past trajectory is
assumed to have been observed and thus known. Altogether, our results reveal
and quantify, on the basis of Gaussian processes, the deep impact of initial
perturbations on first-passage statistics of non-Markovian processes. Our
theory covers the case of spatial dimension higher than one, opening the way to
characterize non-trivial reaction kinetics for complex systems with
non-equilibrium initial conditions.

dissipate into different local thermal baths. Also, one of the bosonic modes
evolves into the squeezed-thermal state because of the parametric amplification
process. Using the Heisenberg-Langevin approach, combined with quantum phase
space formulation, we get an analytical expression for the steady-state Wigner
entropy production rate. It contains two key terms. The first one is an
Onsager-like expression that describes heat flow within the system. The second
term resulted from vacuum fluctuations of the baths. Analyses show that
self-correlation between the quadratures of the parametrically amplified mode
pushes the mode towards the thermal squeezed state. It increases vacuum entropy
production of the total system and reduces the heat current between the modes.
The results imply that, unlike other previous proposals, squeezing can
constrain the efficiency of actual non-equilibrium heat engines by irreversible
flows.

classification results with much fewer labels than supervised approaches. The
Local and Global Consistency (LGC) algorithm is one of the most well-known
graph-based semi-supervised (GSSL) classifiers. Notably, its solution can be
written as a linear combination of the known labels. The coefficients of this
linear combination depend on a parameter $\alpha$, determining the decay of the
reward over time when reaching labeled vertices in a random walk. In this work,
we discuss how removing the self-influence of a labeled instance may be
beneficial, and how it relates to leave-one-out error. Moreover, we propose to
minimize this leave-one-out loss with automatic differentiation. Within this
framework, we propose methods to estimate label reliability and diffusion rate.
Optimizing the diffusion rate is more efficiently accomplished with a spectral
representation. Results show that the label reliability approach competes with
robust L1-norm methods and that removing diagonal entries reduces the risk of
overfitting and leads to suitable criteria for parameter selection.

the study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions of boundary value problems

formulated half-space problem, based on generalizations of stationary
half-space problems in one spatial variable for the Boltzmann equation - for
hard-sphere models of monatomic single species and multicomponent mixtures - is
considered. The number of conditions on the indata at the interface needed to
obtain well-posedness is investigated. Exponential fast convergence is obtained
""far away"" from the interface. In particular, the exponential decay at regime
transitions - where the number of conditions on the indata needed to obtain
well-posedness changes - for linearized kinetic half-space problems related to
the half-space problem of evaporation and condensation in kinetic theory are
considered. The regime transitions correspond to the transition between
subsonic and supersonic evaporation/condensation, or the transition between
evaporation and condensation. Near the regime transitions, slowly varying modes
might occur, preventing uniform exponential speed of convergence there. By
imposing extra conditions on the indata at the interface, the slowly varying
modes can be eliminated near a regime transition, giving rise to uniform
exponential speed of convergence near the regime transition.
  Values of the velocity of the flow at the far end, for which regime
transitions take place are presented for some particular variants of the
Boltzmann equation: for monatomic and polyatomic single species and mixtures,
and the quantum variant for bosons and fermions.

introducing and rigorously defining the concept of the effective polarization

migration barriers under electric fields on the local atomic environments (LAE)
of an adatom. We find that the LAE significantly affects $\mu$ and $\alpha$ of

systematic DFT calculations are needed to fully parameterize surface diffusion
in terms of energy barriers for long-term large scale simulations, such as our

levels. Specifically, the proposed framework optimizes the dispatch plan of an
upstream medium voltage (MV) grid accounting for the flexibility offered by
downstream low voltage (LV) grids and the knowledge of the uncertainties of the
stochastic resources. The framework considers grid, i.e., operational limits on
the nodal voltages, lines, and transformer capacity using a linearized grid
model, and controllable resources' constraints. The dispatching problem is
formulated as a stochastic-optimization scheme considering uncertainty on
stochastic power generation and demands and the voltage imposed by the upstream
grid. The problem is solved by a distributed optimization method relying on the
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) that splits the main problem
into an aggregator problem (solved at the MV-grid level) and several local
problems (solved at the MV-connected-controllable-resources and LV-grid
levels). The use of distributed optimization enables a decentralized dispatch
computation where the centralized aggregator is agnostic about the
parameters/models of the participating resources and downstream grids. The
framework is validated for interconnected CIGRE medium- and low-voltage
networks hosting heterogeneous stochastic and controllable resources.

understood, despite the central role of phosphorus in terrestrial biochemistry.
We present ALMA Band 3 and 4 observations of PO and PN towards the Class I
protostar B1-a, representing the first spatially resolved observations of
phosphorus carriers towards a Solar-type star forming region. The phosphorus
molecules emit from two distinct clumps, which coincide with regions where the
protostellar outflow (traced by SiO) interacts with a filament of dense gas
(traced by CCS). Thus, the gas-phase phosphorus seems to originate from the
shocking of dense interstellar clumps. Based on the observed emission patterns,
PO and PN appear to be daughter products of a solid phosphorus carrier with an
intermediate volatility between ices and silicate grains. Interstellar shocks
may therefore play an important role in converting semi-refractory phosphorus
to a more volatile form prior to incorporation into cometary ices. Indeed, the
(PO+PN)/CH3OH ratio is similar in B1-a and comet 67P, implying a comparable
reservoir of volatile phosphorus. The PO/PN ratio ranges from ~1-8 across B1-a.
The northern emission clump exhibits a lower PO/PN ratio and weaker 13CH3OH
emission than southern clump, indicating distinct shock physics and chemistry
at the two positions. Resolved observations of P carriers towards additional
sources are needed to better understand what regulates such variations in the
PO/PN ratio in protostellar environments.

fully kinetic plasmas. Great progress has been made recently regarding the
applicability of the method in realistic plasma configurations. However, a
reduction of the high computational cost that is inherent to fully kinetic
simulations would be desirable, especially at high velocity space resolutions.
For this purpose, low-rank approximations can be employed. The so far available
low-rank solvers are restricted to either electrostatic systems or low
dimensionality and can therefore not be applied to most space, astrophysical
and fusion plasmas. In this paper we present a new parallel low-rank solver for
the full six-dimensional electromagnetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations with a
compression of the particle distribution function in velocity space. Special
attention is paid to mass conservation and Gauss's law. The low-rank Vlasov
solver is applied to standard benchmark problems of plasma turbulence and
magnetic reconnection and compared to the full grid method. It yields accurate
results at significantly reduced computational cost.

correspondences are exhibited in two coordinate spaces: the local coordinates
describing the geometrical features of each individual anatomical surface and
the world coordinates representing the population-level statistical shape
information after removing global alignment differences across samples in the
given cohort. We propose a deep-learning-based framework that simultaneously
learns these two coordinate spaces directly from the volumetric images. The
proposed joint model serves a dual purpose; the world correspondences can
directly be used for shape analysis applications, circumventing the heavy
pre-processing and segmentation involved in traditional PDM models.
Additionally, the local correspondences can be used for anatomy segmentation.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this joint model for both shape modeling

in recent years, due to its great practical value by only exploiting the
limited user behavior history in the current session. Existing methods
typically learn the session embedding at the item level, namely, aggregating
the embeddings of items with or without the attention weights assigned to
items. However, they ignore the fact that a user's intent on adopting an item
is driven by certain factors of the item (e.g., the leading actors of an
movie). In other words, they have not explored finer-granularity interests of
users at the factor level to generate the session embedding, leading to
sub-optimal performance. To address the problem, we propose a novel method
called Disentangled Graph Neural Network (Disen-GNN) to capture the session
purpose with the consideration of factor-level attention on each item.
Specifically, we first employ the disentangled learning technique to cast item
embeddings into the embedding of multiple factors, and then use the gated graph
neural network (GGNN) to learn the embedding factor-wisely based on the item
adjacent similarity matrix computed for each factor. Moreover, the distance
correlation is adopted to enhance the independence between each pair of
factors. After representing each item with independent factors, an attention
mechanism is designed to learn user intent to different factors of each item in
the session. The session embedding is then generated by aggregating the item
embeddings with attention weights of each item's factors. To this end, our
model takes user intents at the factor level into account to infer the user
purpose in a session. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods.

to allow the process depend polynomially on a formal parameter and to provide
the generalised quantum enveloping (GQE) algebras. We then lift the
restrictions and show that the process still exists via the coloured Kac Moody
algebras. We formulate the GQE conjecture which predicts that every
representation in the category Oint of a Kac-Moody algebra can be deformed into
a representation of an associated GQE algebra. We give various evidences for
this conjecture and make a first step towards its resolution by proving that
Kac-Moody algebras without Serre relations can be deformed into GQE algebras
without Serre relations. In case the conjecture holds, we establish an analog
result for coloured Kac-Moody algebras, we prove that the deformed
representation theories are parallel to the classical one, we explicit a
deformed Serre presentation for GQE algebras, we prove that the latter are the
representatives of a natural class of formal deformations of Kac-Moody algebras
and are h-trivial in finite type. As an application, we explain in terms of
interpolation both classical and quantum Langlands dualities between
representations of Lie algebras, and we propose a new approach which aims at
proving a conjecture of Frenkel-Hernandez. In general, we prove that
representations of two isogenic coloured Kac-Moody algebras can be interpolated
by representations of a third one. Observing that standard quantum algebras

  the intra-atomic approximation to the Bloch states orbital magnetic moment
  approach","16 pages, 3 figures, 2 appendix","Phys. Rev. B 105, 195421 (2022)","10.1103/PhysRevB.105.195421",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using an effective Dirac model, we study the orbital Hall effect (OHE) in
bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides with 2H stacking (2H-TMD). We use
first-order perturbation theory in the interlayer coupling of the bilayer
system to obtain analytical expressions for the orbital Hall conductivity in
the linear response regime. We use two distinct descriptions of the orbital
angular momentum (OAM) operator: The first one is the intra-atomic
approximation that considers only the intrasite contribution to the OAM [Cysne
et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 056601 (2021)]. The second one uses the
Berry-phase formula of the orbital (valley) magnetic moment to describe the OAM
operator [Bhowal and Vignale, Phys. Rev. B 103, 195309 (2021)]. This approach
includes both intersite and intrasite contributions to the OAM. Our results
suggest that the two approaches agree qualitatively in describing the OHE in
bilayers of 2H-TMDs, although they present some quantitative differences. We
also show that interlayer coupling plays an essential role in understanding the
OHE in the unbiased bilayer of 2H-TMD. This coupling causes the Bloch states to
become bonding (antibonding) combinations of states of individual layers,
demanding the consideration of the non-Abelian structure of the orbital
magnetic moment to the occurrence of OHE. As we discuss throughout the work,
the emerging picture of transport of OAM in the unbiased bilayer of 2H-TMDs
based on OHE is very different from the usual picture based on the valley Hall
effect, shedding new lights on previous experimental results. We also discuss
the effect of the inclusion of a gate-voltage bias in the bilayer system. Our
work gives support to recent theoretical predictions on OHE in two-dimensional
materials.

Mantel-Haenszel quotient (MHq) to measure alternative metrics (or altmetrics)
of scientometric data. In this article we review the Mantel-Haenszel
statistics, point out two errors in the literature, and introduce a new
indicator. First, we correct the interpretation of MHq and mention that it is
still a meaningful indicator. Second, we correct the variance formula for MHq,
which leads to narrower confidence intervals. A simulation study shows the
superior performance of our variance estimator and confidence intervals. Since
MHq does not match its original description in the literature, we propose a new
indicator, the Mantel-Haenszel row risk ratio (MHRR), to meet that need.
Interpretation and statistical inference for MHRR are discussed. For both MHRR
and MHq, a value greater (less) than one means performance is better (worse)
than in the reference set called the world.

owing to its high air-stability and anisotropic transport properties. Here, we
investigate the performance of p-type FET based on PdSe$_2$ mono-layer using
multi-scale simulation framework combining Density functional theory and
quantum transport. We find that mono-layer PdSe$_2$ devices show excellent
switching characteristics ($<$ 65 mV/decade) for the source-drain direction
aligned along both [010] and [100] directions. Both directions also show good
on-state current and large transconductance, though these are larger along the
[010] direction for a 15 nm channel device. The channel length scaling study of
these p-FETs indicates that channel length can be easily scaled down to 7 nm
without any significance compromise in the performance. Going below 7 nm, we
find that there is a severe degradation in the sub-threshold swing for 4 nm
channel length. However, this degradation can be minimized by introducing an
underlap structure. The length of underlap is determined by the trade-off
between on-state current and the switching performance.

on the Helmholtz equation and the radiative transfer equation (RTE) as physical
models, in the high-frequency limit. In particular, we evaluate the asymptotic
convergence of a generalized version of inverse scattering problem based on the
Helmholtz equation, to the inverse scattering problem of the Liouville equation
(a simplified version of RTE). The two inverse problems are connected through
the Wigner transform that translates the wave-type description on the physical
space to the kinetic-type description on the phase space, and the Husimi
transform that models data localized both in location and direction. The
finding suggests that impinging tightly concentrated monochromatic beams can
indeed provide stable reconstruction of the medium, asymptotically in the
high-frequency regime. This fact stands in contrast with the unstable
reconstruction for the classical inverse scattering problem when the probing
signals are plane-waves.

We propose a protocol that solves the server-aided PSI problem using delegated
blind quantum computing. More specifically, the proposed protocol allows Alice
and Bob (who do not have any quantum computational resources or quantum memory)
to interact with Steve (who has a quantum computer) in order for Alice and Bob
to obtain set intersection such that privacy is preserved. In particular, Steve
learns nothing about the clients' input, output, or desired computation. The
proposed protocol is correct, secure and blind against a malicious server, and
characterized by a quantum communication complexity that is linear in the input
size.

deletion-compliance to formally model the ""right to be forgotten"", a concept
that confers individuals more control over their digital data. A requirement of
deletion-compliance is strong privacy for the deletion requesters since no
outside observer must be able to tell if deleted data was ever present in the
first place. Naturally, many real world systems where information can flow
across users are automatically ruled out.
  The main thesis of this paper is that deletion-compliance is a standalone
notion, distinct from privacy. We present an alternative definition that
meaningfully captures deletion-compliance without any privacy implications.
This allows broader class of data collectors to demonstrate compliance to
deletion requests and to be paired with various notions of privacy. Our new
definition has several appealing properties:
  - It is implied by the stronger definition of Garg et al. under natural
conditions, and is equivalent when we add a privacy requirement.
  - It is naturally composable with minimal assumptions.
  - Its requirements are met by data structure implementations that do not
reveal the order of operations, a concept known as history-independence.
  Along the way, we discuss the many challenges that remain in providing a
universal definition of compliance to the ""right to be forgotten.""

matter haloes. In Paper I we derived the radial distribution and mass function
(MF) of accreted subhaloes (scaled to the radius and mass of the host halo) and
showed they are essentially universal. This is not the case, however, for those
of stripped subhaloes, which depend on halo mass and assembly history. In Paper
II we derived these latter properties in the simplest case of purely accreting
haloes. Here we extend the study to ordinary haloes having suffered major
mergers. After showing that all the properties of substructure are encoded in
the mean truncated-to-original subhalo mass ratio profile, we demonstrate that
the dependence of the subhalo MF on halo mass arises from their mass-dependent
concentration, while the shape of the subhalo radial distribution depends on
the time of the last major merger of the host halo. In this sense, the latter
property is a better probe of halo formation time than the former.
Unfortunately, this is not the case for the radial distribution of satellites
as this profile is essentially disconnected from subhalo stripping and the
properties of accreted subhaloes are independent of the halo formation time.

  management -- An exploratory study on epidemic response","44 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Humanitarian crises, such as the 2014 West Africa Ebola epidemic, challenge
information management and thereby threaten the digital resilience of the
responding organizations. Crisis information management (CIM) is characterised
by the urgency to respond despite the uncertainty of the situation. Coupled
with high stakes, limited resources and a high cognitive load, crises are prone
to induce biases in the data and the cognitive processes of analysts and
decision-makers. When biases remain undetected and untreated in CIM, they may
lead to decisions based on biased information, increasing the risk of an
inefficient response. Literature suggests that crisis response needs to address
the initial uncertainty and possible biases by adapting to new and better
information as it becomes available. However, we know little about whether
adaptive approaches mitigate the interplay of data and cognitive biases.
  We investigated this question in an exploratory, three-stage experiment on
epidemic response. Our participants were experienced practitioners in the
fields of crisis decision-making and information analysis. We found that
analysts fail to successfully debias data, even when biases are detected, and
that this failure can be attributed to undervaluing debiasing efforts in favor
of rapid results. This failure leads to the development of biased information
products that are conveyed to decision-makers, who consequently make decisions
based on biased information. Confirmation bias reinforces the reliance on
conclusions reached with biased data, leading to a vicious cycle, in which
biased assumptions remain uncorrected. We suggest mindful debiasing as a
possible counter-strategy against these bias effects in CIM.

(HTLpt) using the canonical dimensional regularization (DRG) scheme. Herein, we
revisit this calculation using the regularization by dimensional reduction
(RDR) scheme. Since the RDR scheme manifestly preserves supersymmetry it is the
preferred scheme, however, it is important to assess if and by how much the
resummed perturbative results depend on the regularization scheme used.
Comparing predictions for the scaled entropy obtained using the DRG and RDR
schemes we find that for $\lambda \lesssim 6$ they are numerically very
similar. We then compare the results obtained in both schemes with the strict
perturbative result, which is accurate up to order $\lambda^2$, and a
generalized Pad\'{e} approximant constructed from the known large-$N_c$ weak-
and strong-coupling expansions. Comparing the strict perturbative expansion of
the two-loop HTLpt result with the perturbative expansion to order $\lambda^2$,
we find that both the DRG and RDR HTLpt calculations result in the same
scheme-independent predictions for the coefficients at order $\lambda$,
$\lambda^{3/2}$, and $\lambda^2 \log\lambda$, however, at order $\lambda^2$

the continuous prompt prepended to the input text via derivative-free
optimization. Instead of optimizing in the original high-dimensional prompt
space, which is intractable for traditional derivative-free optimization, we
perform optimization in a randomly generated subspace due to the low intrinsic

tuning with RoBERTa on a few labeled samples not only significantly outperforms
manual prompt and GPT-3's in-context learning, but also surpasses the

can exert sufficient pressure to oppose supersonic stellar wind plasmas,
leading to the formation of a standing bow shock upstream of the magnetopause,
or pressure-balance surface. Scaled laboratory experiments studying the
interaction of an inflowing solar wind analog with a strong, external magnetic
field are a promising new way to study magnetospheric physics and to complement
existing models, although reaching regimes favorable for magnetized shock
formation is experimentally challenging. This paper presents experimental
evidence of the formation of a magnetized bow shock in the interaction of a
supersonic, super-Alfv\'enic plasma with a strongly magnetized obstacle at the
OMEGA laser facility. The solar wind analog is generated by the collision and
subsequent expansion of two counter-propagating, laser-driven plasma plumes.
The magnetized obstacle is a thin wire, driven with strong electrical currents.
Hydrodynamic simulations using the FLASH code predict the colliding plasma
source meets the criteria for bow shock formation. Spatially resolved, optical
Thomson scattering measures the electron number density, and optical emission
lines provide a measurement of the plasma temperature, from which we infer the
presence of a fast magnetosonic shock far upstream of the obstacle. Proton
images provide a measure of large-scale features in the magnetic field
topology, and reconstructed path-integrated magnetic field maps from these
images suggest the formation of a bow shock upstream of the wire and as a
transient magnetopause. We compare features in the reconstructed fields to
two-dimensional MHD simulations of the system.

radiation-transport two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations of truncated disks radiating at ~35% of the Eddington
luminosity with and without large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. We demonstrate
that when a geometrically-thin accretion disk is threaded by large-scale net
poloidal magnetic flux, it self-consistently transitions at small radii into a
two-phase medium of cold gas clumps floating through a hot, magnetically
dominated corona. This transition occurs at a well-defined truncation radius
determined by the distance out to which the disk is saturated with magnetic
flux. The average ion and electron temperatures in the semi-opaque corona
reach, respectively, T_i ~ 10^10K and T_e ~ 5 10^8K. The system produces
radiation, powerful collimated jets and broader winds at the total energy
efficiency exceeding ~90%, the highest ever energy extraction efficiency from a
spinning black hole by a radiatively efficient flow in a GRMHD simulation. This
is consistent with jetted ejections observed during XRB outbursts. The

thermal contact with polymer leading to superior interface thermal conductance

achieve efficient dispersion of graphene into the epoxy matrix. In this study,
we compare the effect of two organic solvents, dimethylformamide (DMF) and

find that polymer-graphene composites made with DMF solvent show 44% higher

of AME and thermal dust emission through linear regression with the

allows us to constrain the level of polarized AME while making minimal
assumptions on its frequency dependence. We neglect cosmic microwave background
fluctuations, but show through simulations that these have a minor impact on
the results. We find that the resulting AME polarization fraction confidence
limit is sensitive to the polarized synchrotron spectral index prior, and for
priors steeper than $\beta_{\mathrm{s}} = -3.1\pm0.1$ we find an upper limit of
$p_{\mathrm{AME}}^{\rm max}\lesssim 0.6\,\%$ ($95\,\%$ confidence). In
contrast, for $\beta_{\mathrm{s}}=-3.0\pm0.1$, we find a nominal detection of
$p_{\mathrm{AME}}=2.5\pm1.0\,\%$ ($95\,\%$ confidence). These data are thus not
strong enough to simultaneously and robustly constrain both polarized
synchrotron emission and AME, and our main result is therefore a constraint on
the AME polarization fraction explicitly as a function of $\beta_\mathrm{s}$.
Combining the current $\textit{Planck}$ and $\textit{WMAP}$ observations with

Rather than propagating individual trajectories, the tensor network approach
propagates a distribution over many-body configurations via a controllable

the composition and structure of the day-night terminator region. Such
retrievals in the past have typically assumed one-dimensional temperature
structures which were adequate to explain extant observations. However, the
increasing data quality expected from exoplanet spectroscopy with JWST
motivates considerations of multidimensional atmospheric retrievals. We present
AURA-3D, a three-dimensional atmospheric retrieval framework for exoplanet
transmission spectra. AURA-3D includes a forward model that enables rapid
computation of transmission spectra in 3D geometry for a given atmospheric
structure and can, therefore, be used for atmospheric retrievals as well as for
computing spectra from General Circulation Models (GCMs). In order to
efficiently explore the space of possible 3D temperature structures in
retrievals, we develop a parametric 3D pressure-temperature profile which can
accurately represent azimuthally-averaged temperature structures of a range of
hot Jupiter GCMs. We apply our retrieval framework to simulated JWST
observations of hot Jupiter transmission spectra, obtaining accurate estimates
of the day-night temperature variation across the terminator as well as the
abundances of chemical species. We demonstrate an example of a model hot
Jupiter transmission spectrum for which a traditional 1D retrieval of
JWST-quality data returns biased abundance estimates, whereas a retrieval
including a day-night temperature gradient can accurately retrieve the true
abundances. Our forward model also has the capability to include inhomogeneous
chemistry as well as variable clouds/hazes. This new retrieval framework opens

The key idea is to encode qubits in a metastable electronic level, such that
gate errors predominantly result in transitions to disjoint subspaces whose
populations can be continuously monitored via fluorescence. We estimate that
98% of errors can be converted into erasures. We quantify the benefit of this
approach via circuit-level simulations of the surface code, finding a threshold
increase from 0.937% to 4.15%. We also observe a larger code distance near the
threshold, leading to a faster decrease in the logical error rate for the same
number of physical qubits, which is important for near-term implementations.
Erasure conversion should benefit any error correcting code, and may also be
applied to design new gates and encodings in other qubit platforms.

amplification and particle acceleration in relativistic shocks and their

particles constitute a highly relativistic and dilute beam, streaming
instabilities typically become inefficient and operate at very small scales
when compared to the gyroradii of the beam particles. We report on a plasma
cavitation instability that is driven by dilute relativistic beams and can
increase both the magnetic field strength and coherence scale by orders of
magnitude to reach near-equipartition values with the beam energy density. This
instability grows after the development of the Weibel instability and is
associated with the asymmetric response of background leptons and ions to the
beam current. The resulting net inductive electric field drives a strong energy
asymmetry between positively and negatively charged beam species. Large-scale
particle-in-cell simulations are used to verify analytical predictions for the
growth and saturation level of the instability and indicate that it is robust
over a wide range of conditions, including those associated with pair-loaded

of Robust Artificial-neural-networks for K-space Interpolation (RAKI), when
only a limited amount of training data (auto-calibration signals, ACS) are
available for accelerated standard 2D imaging. Methods: In a first step, the
RAKI model was optimized for the case of strongly limited training data amount.
In the iterative learning approach (termed iterative RAKI), the optimized RAKI
model is initially trained using original and augmented ACS obtained from a
linear parallel imaging reconstruction. Subsequently, the RAKI convolution
filters are refined iteratively using original and augmented ACS extracted from
the previous RAKI reconstruction. Evaluation was carried out on 200
retrospectively undersampled in-vivo datasets from the fastMRI neuro database
with different contrast settings. Results: For limited training data (18 and 22
ACS lines for R=4 and R=5, respectively), iterative RAKI outperforms standard
RAKI by reducing residual artefacts and yields strong noise suppression when
compared to standard parallel imaging, underlined by quantitative
reconstruction quality metrics. In combination with a phase constraint, further
reconstruction improvements can be achieved. Additionally, iterative RAKI shows
better performance than both GRAPPA and RAKI in case of pre-scan calibration
with varying contrast between training- and undersampled data. Conclusion: The
iterative learning approach with RAKI benefits from standard RAKIs well known
noise suppression feature but requires less original training data for the
accurate reconstruction of standard 2D images thereby improving net
acceleration.

  Understanding the Physics Driving Offsets at High-Redshift","25 pages, 15 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ac43b8",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Baldwin, Philips, & Terlevich diagram of [O III]/H$\beta$ vs. [N
II]/H$\alpha$ (hereafter N2-BPT) has long been used as a tool for classifying
galaxies based on the dominant source of ionizing radiation. Recent
observations have demonstrated that galaxies at $z\sim2$ reside offset from
local galaxies in the N2-BPT space. In this paper, we conduct a series of
controlled numerical experiments to understand the potential physical processes
driving this offset. We model nebular line emission in a large sample of
galaxies, taken from the SIMBA cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation
simulation, using the CLOUDY photoionization code to compute the nebular line
luminosities from H II regions. We find that the observed shift toward higher
[O III]/H$\beta$ and [N II]/H$\alpha$ values at high redshift arises from
sample selection: when we consider only the most massive galaxies $M_* \sim
10^{10-11} M_\odot$, the offset naturally appears, due to their high
metallicities. We predict that deeper observations that probe lower-mass
galaxies will reveal galaxies that lie on a locus comparable to $z\sim 0$
observations. Even when accounting for sample selection effects, we find that
there is a subtle mismatch between simulations and observations. To resolve
this discrepancy, we investigate the impact of varying ionization parameters, H
II region densities, gas-phase abundance patterns, and increasing radiation
field hardness on N2-BPT diagrams. We find that either decreasing the
ionization parameter or increasing the N/O ratio of galaxies at fixed O/H can
move galaxies along a self-similar arc in N2-BPT space that is occupied by
high-redshift galaxies.

high-resolution $\Lambda$CDM magnetohydrodynamic simulations of galaxy
formation. These simulations produce isolated, disc-dominated galaxies with

comparable to those of the Milky Way. For a specific choice of annihilation
cross-section, they agree well with the Fermi-LAT data over the full observed
angular range, $1^{\circ}$ to $15^{\circ}$, whereas their dark-matter only
counterparts, lacking any compression of the inner halo by the gravitational
effects of the baryons, fail to predict emission as centrally concentrated as
observed. These results provide additional support to the hypothesis that the
GCE is produced by annihilating dark matter. If, however, it is produced by a
different mechanism, they imply a strong upper limit on annihilation rates
which can be translated into upper limits on the expected $\gamma$-ray flux not
only from the inner Galaxy but also from any substructure, with or without
stars, in the Galactic halo.

the phase-flip errors, we employ the minimum-weight-perfect-matching (MWPM)

threshold ($\sim 1.7\%$) under phenomenological noise for the sweep decoder and
the code capacity threshold (lower bounded by $2.95\%$) for the MWPM decoder

be mapped to the critical point of a zero-temperature confinement-Higgs

Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in particular, are known to sensitively
probe supermassive black holes near their horizon; yet estimates for
constraints on deviations from Kerr in space-based gravitational wave
observations (e.g. with LISA) of such systems are currently based on
equatorially symmetric models. We use modified ""analytic kludge"" waveforms to
estimate how accurately LISA will be able to measure or constrain equatorial

$S_2, M_3$. We find that the dimensionless multipole ratios such as $S_2/M^3$

TESS, and ground-based photometry, HARPS high-resolution spectroscopy, and
Gemini speckle imaging. We characterise the host star and determine $T_{\rm

$M_{\star}=0.748\pm0.032$ $M_{\odot}$. We present a novel detrending method
based on PSF shape-change modelling and demonstrate its suitability to correct

and find that TOI-1064 b has an orbital period of $P_{\rm b}=6.44387\pm0.00003$
d, a radius of $R_{\rm b}=2.59\pm0.04$ $R_{\oplus}$, and a mass of $M_{\rm

of $\sim$1.6%, allowing us to conduct internal structure and atmospheric escape
modelling. TOI-1064 b is one of the densest, well-characterised sub-Neptunes,
with a tenuous atmosphere that can be explained by the loss of a primordial
envelope following migration through the protoplanetary disc. It is likely that
TOI-1064 c has an extended atmosphere due to the tentative low density, however
further RVs are needed to confirm this scenario and the similar radii,
different masses nature of this system. The high-precision data and modelling
of TOI-1064 b are important for planets in this region of mass-radius space,
and it allows us to identify a trend in bulk density-stellar metallicity for
massive sub-Neptunes that may hint at the formation of this population of

nature of dark matter. Recently, in Malhan et al. (2021), we employed N-body
simulations to show that the cuspy cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos predicted by
cosmological simulations can be differentiated from cored subhalos using the
properties of accreted globular cluster (GC) streams since these GCs experience
tidal stripping within their parent halos prior to accretion onto the Milky
Way. We previously found that clusters that are accreted within cuspy subhalos
produce streams with larger physical widths and higher dispersions in
line-of-sight velocity and angular momentum than streams that are accreted
within cored subhalos. Here, we use the same suite of simulations to
demonstrate that the dispersion in the tangential velocities of streams
($\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$) is also sensitive to the central DM density
profiles of their parent dwarfs and GCs that were accreted from: cuspy subhalos
produce streams with larger $\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ than those accreted
inside cored subhalos. Using Gaia EDR3 observations of multiple GC streams we
compare their $\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ values with simulations. The measured
$\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$ values are consistent with both an ``in situ'' origin
and with accretion inside cored subhalos of $M\sim 10^{8-9}M_{\odot}$ (or very
low-mass cuspy subhalos of mass $\sim 10^8M_{\odot}$). Despite the large
current uncertainties in $\sigma_{v_\mathrm{Tan}}$, we find a low probability
that any of the progenitor GCs were accreted from cuspy subhalos of $M_{\rm
subhalo}\buildrel > \over \sim$ $10^9 M_{\odot}$. The uncertainties on Gaia
tangential velocity measurements are expected to decrease in future and will
allow for stronger constraints on subhalo DM density profiles.

larger in the relevant expressions than one might have guessed from their
suppression in the off-shell potential. Some corrections appear without any
parametric suppression at all, which makes them particularly dangerous for
candidate dS vacua. Other types of corrections can in principle be made small
for appropriate parameter choices. However, we show in an explicit model that
this is never possible for all corrections at the same time when the vacuum
energy is positive. Some of the corrections we consider are also relevant for
the stability of non-supersymmetric AdS vacua.

cannot be distinguished from the Standard Model (SM) in these decays. However,
new physics that is not MFV can mimic large $U$-spin breaking. Requiring that

which originate from distant galaxies. Revealing the origin of FRBs is becoming
central in astronomy. The redshift evolution of the FRB energy function, i.e.,
the number density of FRB sources as a function of energy, provides important
implications for the FRB progenitors. Here we show the energy functions of FRBs
selected from the recently released Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
Experiment (CHIME) catalogue using the $V_{\rm max}$ method. The $V_{\rm max}$
method allows us to measure the redshift evolution of the energy functions as
it is without any prior assumption on the evolution. We use a homogeneous
sample of 164 non-repeating FRB sources, which are about one order of magnitude
larger than previously investigated samples. The energy functions of
non-repeating FRBs show Schechter function-like shapes at $z\lesssim1$. The
energy functions and volumetric rates of non-repeating FRBs decrease towards
higher redshifts similar to the cosmic stellar-mass density evolution: there is
no significant difference between the non-repeating FRB rate and cosmic
stellar-mass density evolution with a 1\% significance threshold, whereas the
cosmic star-formation rate scenario is rejected with a more than 99\%
confidence level. Our results indicate that the event rate of non-repeating
FRBs is likely controlled by old populations rather than young populations
which are traced by the cosmic star-formation rate density. This suggests old
populations such as old neutron stars and black holes as more likely
progenitors of non-repeating FRBs.

evolution is the selection of pure and complete merger samples in observations.
In particular, while large and reasonably pure interacting galaxy pair samples
can be obtained with relative ease via spectroscopic criteria, automated
selection of post-coalescence merger remnants is restricted to the physical
characteristics of remnants alone. Furthermore, such selection has
predominantly focused on imaging data -- whereas kinematic data may offer a
complimentary basis for identifying merger remnants. Therefore, we examine the
theoretical utility of both the morphological and kinematic features of merger
remnants in distinguishing galaxy merger remnants from other galaxies. Deep
classification models are calibrated and evaluated using idealized synthetic
images and line-of-sight stellar velocity maps of a heterogeneous population of
galaxies and merger remnants from the TNG100 cosmological hydrodynamical
simulation. We show that even idealized stellar kinematic data has limited
utility compared to imaging and under-performs by $2.1\%\pm0.5\%$ in
completeness and $4.7\%\pm0.4\%$ in purity for our fiducial model architecture.
Combining imaging and stellar kinematics offers a small boost in completeness
(by $1.8\%\pm0.4\%$, compared to $92.7\%\pm0.2\%$ from imaging alone) but no
change in purity ($0.1\%\pm0.3\%$ improvement compared to $92.7\%\pm0.2\%$,
evaluated with equal numbers of merger remnant and non-remnant control
galaxies). Classification accuracy of all models is particularly sensitive to
physical companions at separations $\lesssim40$ kpc and to
time-since-coalescence. Taken together, our results show that the stellar

construct a simulation framework to calculate yields and distributions of

experimental limitation in the resolution of double-track lateral distance,
only dimuon produced outside the detector volume are considered. Detailed

the average energy loss formula used in that work results in more events by

dust polarization maps from a set of global magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of Milky-Way-sized galaxies, and analyze their power spectra at
intermediate angular scales (angular multipoles $\ell \in \left[60 ,\,

magnetic field, its strength, and the feedback on the power spectrum
characteristics. Using full-galaxy MHD simulations, we were able to estimate
the variance induced by the peculiar location of the observer in the galaxy. We
find that the polarization power spectra sensitively depend on the observer's
location, impeding a distinction between different simulation setups. There is
a clear statistical difference between the power spectra measured from within
the spiral arms and those measured from the inter-arm regions. Also, power
spectra from within supernova-driven bubbles share common characteristics,
regardless of the underlying model. However, no correlation was found between
the properties of the polarization power spectra and the local (with respect to
the observer) mean values of physical quantities such as the density and the
strength of the magnetic field. Finally, we find indications that the global
strength of the magnetic field may play a role in shaping the power spectrum
characteristics; as the global magnetic field strength increases, the E/B
asymmetry and the TE correlation increase, whereas the viewpoint-induced
variance decreases. However, we find no direct correlation with the strength of
the local magnetic field that permeates the mapped region of the interstellar
medium.

in cases where the underlying features of the practice are subject to

students will be nearly perfect performers while others receiving the same

cultural evolution models centered on high-fidelity transmission with minimal
copying errors, which lead to a much narrower distribution where students are
mostly equally mediocre. The model also predicts generic features of the

that a primordial misalignment is not required and that the observed retrograde
state is a natural consequence of the chaotic stellar obliquity evolution
driven by a wider-orbit companion C at ~2000 au long after the disk disperses.
The star C drives eccentricity and/or inclination oscillations on the inner
binary orbit, leading to widespread chaos from the periodic resonance passages
between the stellar spin and planetary secular modes. Based on a population
synthesis study, we find that the observed stellar obliquity is reached in
~40-70% of the systems, making this mechanism a robust outcome of the secular
dynamics,regardless of the spin-down history of the central star. This work
highlights the unusual role that very distant companions can have on the orbits
of close-in planets and the host star's spin evolution, connecting four orders

star-formation process, and its impact on the properties of protoplanetary
discs and on the formation of planets is still to be fully understood. To date,
no detailed uniform study of the gas emission from a sample of protoplanetary
discs around multiple stellar systems has been performed. Here we analyse new
ALMA observations at a $\sim$21 au resolution of the molecular CO gas emission
targeting discs in eight multiple stellar systems in the Taurus star-forming
regions. $^{12}$CO gas emission is detected around all primaries and in seven
companions. With these data, we estimate the inclination and the position angle
for all primary discs and for five secondary or tertiary discs, and measure the
gas disc radii of these objects with a cumulative flux technique on the
spatially resolved zeroth moment images. When considering the radius including
95\% of the flux as a metric, the estimated gas disc size in multiple stellar
systems is found to be on average $\sim 4.2$ times larger than the dust disc
size. This ratio is higher than what was recently found in a population of more
isolated and single systems. On the contrary, when considering the radius
including 68\% of the flux, no difference between multiple and single discs is
found in the distribution of ratios. This discrepancy is due to the sharp
truncation of the outer dusty disc observed in multiple stellar systems. The
measured gas disc sizes are consistent with tidal truncation models in multiple
stellar systems assuming eccentricities of $\sim0.15$-$0.5$, as expected in
typical binary systems.

Although the companion is apparently unique among confirmed or candidate

merger is expected to provide exciting new constraints on the dense-matter
equation of state (EoS). Such constraints rely, by and large, on the existence
of quasi-universal relations, which relate the peak frequencies of the
post-merger GW spectrum to properties of the neutron star structure in a
model-independent way. In this work, we report on violations of existing
quasi-universal relations between the peak spectral frequency, f_2, and the
stellar radius, for EoSs models with backwards-bending slopes in their
mass-radius relations (such that the radius increases at high masses). The
violations are extreme, with variations in f_2 of up to ~600 Hz between EoSs
that predict the same radius for a 1.4 Msun neutron star, but that have
significantly different radii at higher masses. Quasi-universality can be
restored by adding in a second parameter to the fitting formulae that depends
on the slope of the mass-radius curve. We further find strong evidence that
quasi-universality is better maintained for the radii of very massive stars
(with masses 2 Msun). Both statements imply that f_2 is mainly sensitive to the
high-density EoS. Combined with observations of the binary neutron star
inspiral, these generalized quasi-universal relations can be used to
simultaneously infer the characteristic radius and slope of the neutron star
mass-radius relation.

that, beside the usual factor ordering ambiguities, there is an ambiguity in

second, the other first order. In both cases two time variables may be defined,
conjugate to $\Lambda$ and to the radiation constant of motion. We make little
headway with the second-order theory, but are able to produce solutions to the
first-order theory. They exhibit the well-known ""ringing"" whereby incident and
reflected waves interfere, leading to oscillations in the probability
distribution even for well-peaked wave packets. We also examine in detail the

offers a robust avenue for developing techniques to extract exoplanet
reflection spectra. We aimed to extract the optical reflected light spectrum of
the non-transiting hot Jupiter 51 Peg b by adapting techniques designed to
remove tellurics in infrared HRCCS to instead remove optical stellar lines.
Importantly, we investigated the so far neglected impact of the broadening of
the reflected host star spectrum due to the difference between the stellar
rotation and the planet's orbital velocity. We used 484, R=115000 optical
spectra of 51 Peg b from HARPS-N and HARPS, which we aligned to the exact
stellar rest frame in order to effectively remove the contaminating host star.
However, some stellar residuals remained, likely due to stellar activity. We
cross-correlated with an appropriately broadened synthetic stellar model to
search for the planet's Doppler-shifting spectrum. We detect no significant
reflected light from 51 Peg b and report a S/N=3 upper limit on the contrast
ratio of 76.0 ppm (7.60x10$^{-5}$) when including broadening, and 24.0 ppm

combinations of previously claimed detections. Broadening can significantly
impact the ability of HRCCS to extract reflected light spectra and must be

decision-making activities of software practitioners. The writing of these two
patterns was informed by the solutions employed in the context of two case
studies on software analytics practices, and the patterns were further
validated by searching for their occurrence in the literature. The pattern
Broad-Spectrum Diagnostic proposes to conduct more broad analysis based on
common metrics when the team does not have the expertise to understand the kind
of problems that software analytics can help to solve; and the pattern Embedded
Improvements suggests adding improvement tasks as part of other routine
activities.

the former to coupling constants arising from dual symmetry-breaking, and the
latter to coupling constants due to single symmetry-breaking. Using three

wide-field, high cadence optical time-domain surveys, raises the possibility of
the first joint GW-electromagnetic (EM) detections of core-collapse supernovae
(CCSNe). For targeted searches of GWs from CCSNe optical observations can be
used to increase the sensitivity of the search by restricting the relevant time
interval, defined here as the GW search window (GSW). The extent of the GSW is
a critical factor in determining the achievable false alarm probability (FAP)
for a triggered CCSN search. The ability to constrain the GSW from optical
observations depends on how early a CCSN is detected, as well as the ability to
model the early optical emission. Here we present several approaches to
constrain the GSW, ranging in complexity from model-independent analytical fits
of the early light curve, model-dependent fits of the rising or entire light
curve, and a new data-driven approach using existing well-sampled CCSN light
curves from {\it Kepler} and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).
We use these approaches to determine the time of core-collapse and its
associated uncertainty (i.e., the GSW). We apply our methods to two Type II SNe
that occurred during LIGO/Virgo Observing Run 3: SN\,2019fcn and SN\,2019ejj
(both in the same galaxy at $d=15.7$ Mpc). Our approach shortens the duration

in past GW CCSN searches.

end of Moore's law and the still accelerating interest in domain-specific
computing, such as machine learning - forces us to radically rethink our
compiler designs. The era of a universal compiler framework built around a
single one-size-fits-all intermediate representation (IR) is over. This
realization has sparked the creation of the MLIR compiler framework that
empowers compiler engineers to design and integrate IRs capturing specific
abstractions. MLIR provides a generic framework for SSA-based IRs, but it
doesn't help us to decide how we should design IRs that are easy to develop, to
work with and to combine into working compilers.
  To address the challenge of IR design, we advocate for a language-oriented
compiler design that understands IRs as formal programming languages and
enforces their correct use via an accompanying type system. We argue that
programming language techniques directly guide extensible IR designs and
provide a formal framework to reason about transforming between multiple IRs.
In this paper, we discuss the design of the Shine compiler that compiles the
high-level functional pattern-based data-parallel language RISE via a hybrid
functional-imperative intermediate language to C, OpenCL, and OpenMP.
  We compare our work directly with the closely related pattern-based Lift IR
and compiler. We demonstrate that our language-oriented compiler design results
in a more robust and predictable compiler that is extensible at various
abstraction levels. Our experimental evaluation shows that this compiler design
is able to generate high-performance GPU code.

problem we call Scale Reliant Inference (SRI). Many scientific fields collect
multivariate data that lack scale: where the size, sum, or total of each
measurement is arbitrary and is not representative of the scale of the
underlying system being measured. For example, in the analysis of
high-throughput sequencing data, it is well known that the number of sequencing
reads (the sequencing depth) varies substantially due non-biological
(technical) factors. This article develops a formal problem statement for SRI
which unifies problems seen in multiple scientific fields. Informally, we
define SRI as an estimation problem in which an estimand of interest cannot be
uniquely identified due to the lack of scale information in the observed data.
This problem statement represents a reformulation of the related field of
Compositional Data Analysis and allows us to prove fundamental limits on SRI.
For example, we prove that inferential criteria such as consistency,
calibration, and bias are unattainable for common SRI tasks. Moreover, we show
that common methods often applied to SRI implicitly assume infinite knowledge
of the system scale and can lead to a troubling phenomena termed unacknowledged
bias. Counter-intuitively, we show that this problem worsens with more data and
can lead to substantially elevated Type-I and Type-II error rates. Still, we
show that rigorous statistical inference is possible so long as models
acknowledge the fundamental uncertainty in the system scale. We introduce a
class of models we call Scale Simulation Random Variables (SSRVs) as flexible,
rigorous, and computationally efficient approach to SRI.

intensive, requiring significant resources. This major challenge highlights the
need for data compression techniques. In this study, we apply a
physics-informed Deep Learning technique based on vector quantization to
generate a discrete, low-dimensional representation of data from simulations of
three-dimensional turbulent flows. The deep learning framework is composed of
convolutional layers and incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as
preserving incompressibility and global statistical characteristics of the
velocity gradients. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical,
comparison-based similarity and physics-based metrics. The training data set is
produced from Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically
stationary, isotropic turbulent flow. The performance of this lossy data
compression scheme is evaluated not only with unseen data from the stationary,
isotropic turbulent flow, but also with data from decaying isotropic
turbulence, and a Taylor-Green vortex flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR)
as the ratio of original data size to the compressed one, the results show that
our model based on vector quantization can offer CR $=85$ with a mean square
error (MSE) of $O(10^{-3})$, and predictions that faithfully reproduce the
statistics of the flow, except at the very smallest scales where there is some
loss. Compared to the recent study based on a conventional autoencoder where
compression is performed in a continuous space, our model improves the CR by
more than $30$ percent, and reduces the MSE by an order of magnitude. Our
compression model is an attractive solution for situations where fast, high

  Molecular Devices","25 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The chirality--spin interaction is a fascinating topic for physicists and
chemists. For example, chiral molecules like DNA generate giant spin
polarization in nanodevices characterized by large magnetoresistance (MR). This
phenomenon, called chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), paves pathways
for unconventional spintronic devices and enantiomer separation. Different from
ordinary transport, CISS MR violates Onsager's reciprocal relation, and its
physical mechanism is elusive and debated. In this work, we propose that the
CISS MR is intimately related to the electric magnetochiral anisotropy (EMCA)
while EMCA respects Onsager's relation. In a molecular device including a
ferromagnetic electrode, the chiral molecule, as a spin polarizer, leads to
EMCA in the second-order response to the electric field. However, EMCA further
generates extra charge accumulation in the device given the insulating nature
of the molecule. Here, reversing either electrode magnetization or molecule
chirality changes the charge accumulation, which we term magnetochiral charge
polarization (MCCP). Then MCCP modifies the tunneling barrier, alters the
tunneling resistance sensitively, and thus, leads to a higher-order MR that
violates Onsager's reciprocity. Our model reveals the deep connection between
EMCA and CISS MR and explains the unusually large MR ratio and nonequilibrium
nature of CISS. We predict that the molecular spin valve device exhibits a
crossover from CISS-MR to EMCA when the chiral molecule turns more metallic
because of losing the accumulated charge. We further anticipate CISS MR may
appear in chiral molecular devices without ferromagnetic electrodes but in an
external magnetic field in case EMCA and charge accumulation co-exist.

non-linear activations; instead, we replace them with sets of locally and
stochastically competing linear units. In this setting, each network layer
yields sparse outputs, determined by the outcome of the competition between
units that are organized into blocks of competitors. We adopt stochastic
arguments for the competition mechanism, which perform posterior sampling to
determine the winner of each block. We further endow the considered networks
with the ability to infer the sub-part of the network that is essential for
modeling the data at hand; we impose appropriate stick-breaking priors to this
end. To further enrich the information of the emerging representations, we
resort to information-theoretic principles, namely the Information Competing
Process (ICP). Then, all the components are tied together under the stochastic
Variational Bayes framework for inference. We perform a thorough experimental
investigation for our approach using benchmark datasets on image

structure susceptible to be modified by a alteration of their chemical

interesting playground to explore quasiparticle interactions in low-dimensional
systems. Despite the great effort invested so far, a detailed understanding of
the interactions governing the electronic and magnetic properties of the
low-dimensional systems is still incomplete. One of the reasons is the limited
ability to characterize their magnetic properties at the atomic scale. Here, we
provide a comprehensive study of the magnetic properties of metal-organic
one-dimensional (1D) coordination polymers consisting of
2,5-diamino-1,4-benzoquinonediimine ligands coordinated with Co or Cr atoms
synthesized in ultra-high vacuum conditions on a Au(111) surface. A combination
of an integral X-ray spectroscopy with local-probe inelastic electron tunneling

numerically that this model of inflation is viable. In this sense, we could
verify that the introduction of the coupling function $f(\phi)$ in our model of

sufficient inflation. This is a remarkable result, since without the coupling
function contribution, the amount of $e$-foldings is smaller at the end of
inflation, as has been demonstrated in Heisenberg et al. (2018). Also, the

The adult fly has a stiff exoskeleton with articulated limbs capable of
long-distance navigation and rich social interactions. Because the larval and
adult forms are so distinct in structure, they require distinct strategies for
sensing and moving the body. The metamorphic divide thus presents an
opportunity for comparative analysis of neural circuits. Here, we review recent
progress toward understanding the neural mechanisms of proprioception and motor

  solutions",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ionic-liquid based acidic aqueous biphasic solutions (AcABS) recently offered
a breakthrough in the field of metal recycling. Indeed, the mixture of
tributyltetradecylphosphonium chloride (P$_{44414}$Cl) and acid with water
content larger than 60 \% presents a phase separation with very good extraction
efficiency for metallic ions. Moreover, this ternary solution presents a Lower
Solution Critical Temperature (LCST), meaning that the biphasic area of the
phase diagram increases upon increase of temperature, in other terms the phase
separation from a homogeneous liquid can be induced by an elevation of
temperature, typically a few tens of degrees. We address here the microscopic
mechanisms driving the phase separation. Small Angle Neutron Scattering
provides us with structural information for various acid content and
temperature. We characterized the spherical micelle formation in the binary
ionic liquid/water solution and the micelle aggregation upon addition of acid,
due of the screening of electrostatic repulsion. If addition of salt leads to
identical transitions in the solution, the ionic strength is not a relevant
parameter and more subtle effects such as ion size or polarizability have to be
taken into account to rationalize the phase diagram. The increase of both acid
concentration and/or temperature eventually leads to the micelle flocculation
and phase separation. This last step is achieved through chloride ion
adsorption at the surface of the micelle with an enthalpy of adsorption of
$\sim$ 12 kJ/mol. The attraction between micelles can be well understood in
terms of DLVO potential. This exothermic adsorption compensates the entropic
cost, leading to the counter-intuitive behavior of the system.

linear stability of black holes and naked singularities is given. The standard
modal approach, that takes advantage of the background symmetries and analyze
separately the harmonic components of linear perturbations, is briefly
introduced and used to prove that the naked singularities in the Kerr--Newman
family, as well as the inner black hole regions beyond Cauchy horizons, are
unstable and therefore unphysical. The proofs require a treatment of the
boundary condition at the timelike boundary, which is given in detail. The
nonmodal linear stability concept is then introduced, and used to prove that
the domain of outer communications of a Schwarzschild black hole with a
non-negative cosmological constant satisfies this stronger stability condition,
which rules out transient growths of perturbations, and also to show that the
perturbed black hole settles into a slowly rotating Kerr black hole. The
encoding of the perturbation fields in gauge invariant curvature scalars and
the effects of the perturbation on the geometry of the spacetime is discussed.

light particles can freeze-out separately. We consider results for the chemical
freeze-out parameters obtained from thermal model fits and from calculating
net-particle fluctuations. We will show the effect of using one global
temperature to fit all particles and alternatively, allowing particles with and

and potentially for quantum applications. A fundamental understanding of the
interaction between RE dopants and the semiconductor host is key to realizing
the material's full potential. This work reports an investigation of lanthanide
($Ln$) defects in GaN using hybrid density-functional defect calculations. We
find that all the $Ln$ dopants incorporated at the Ga lattice site, $Ln_{\rm
Ga}$ ($Ln$ = La--Lu), are stable as trivalent ions, but Eu and Yb can also be
stabilized as divalent and Ce, Pr, and Tb as tetravalent. The location of
$Ln$-related defect levels and the $Ln$ $4f$ states in the energy spectrum of
the host material is determined from first principles. We elucidate the
interplay between defect formation and electronic structure, including the
$Ln$--N interaction, and the effect of doping on the local lattice environment.
Optical properties are investigated by considering possible defect-to-band and
band-to-defect transitions involving $Ln_{\rm Ga}$ defects with in-gap energy
levels, including broad ""charge-transfer"" transitions. These defects can also
act as carrier traps and mediate energy transfer from the host into the
$4f$-electron core of the $Ln$ ion which leads to sharp intra-$f$ luminescence.

relics of hot Jupiter formation. Based on the characteristics of systems with
and without high obliquities, it is suspected that obliquities are tidally
damped when the star has a thick convective envelope, as is the case for
main-sequence stars cooler than ~6100K, and the orbit is within ~8 stellar
radii. A promising theory for tidal obliquity damping is the dissipation of
inertial waves within the star's convective envelope. Here, we consider the
implications of this theory for the timing of hot Jupiter formation.
Specifically, hot stars that currently lack a convective envelope possess one
during their pre-main sequence. We find that hot Jupiters orbiting within a
critical distance of ~0.02au from a misaligned main-sequence star lacking a
thick convective envelope must have acquired their tight orbits after a few
tens of millions of years in order to have retained their obliquities
throughout the pre-main-sequence. There are 4 known systems for which this
argument applies--XO-3b, Corot-3b, WASP-14b, and WASP-121b--subject to
uncertainties surrounding inertial wave dissipation. Moreover, we conclude that
a recently-identified overabundance of near-polar hot Jupiters is unlikely
sculpted by tides, instead reflecting their primordial configuration. Finally,
hot Jupiters arriving around cool stars after a few 100s of millions of years
likely find the host star rotating too slowly for efficient obliquity damping.
We predict that the critical effective temperature separating aligned and
misaligned stars should vary with metallicity, from 6300K to 6000K as [Fe/H]
varies from -0.3 to +0.3.

against certain subpopulations regarding sensitive attributes such as race and
gender. Among the many existing fairness notions, counterfactual fairness
measures the model fairness from a causal perspective by comparing the
predictions of each individual from the original data and the counterfactuals.
In counterfactuals, the sensitive attribute values of this individual had been
modified. Recently, a few works extend counterfactual fairness to graph data,
but most of them neglect the following facts that can lead to biases: 1) the
sensitive attributes of each node's neighbors may causally affect the
prediction w.r.t. this node; 2) the sensitive attributes may causally affect
other features and the graph structure. To tackle these issues, in this paper,
we propose a novel fairness notion - graph counterfactual fairness, which
considers the biases led by the above facts. To learn node representations
towards graph counterfactual fairness, we propose a novel framework based on
counterfactual data augmentation. In this framework, we generate
counterfactuals corresponding to perturbations on each node's and their
neighbors' sensitive attributes. Then we enforce fairness by minimizing the
discrepancy between the representations learned from the original graph and the
counterfactuals for each node. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
graphs show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in
graph counterfactual fairness, and also achieves comparable prediction
performance.

and synergy). Here we show that the principle of complementarity is linked to
the abundance of quadrangles (4-cycles) and dense bipartite-like subgraphs. We
link both principles to their characteristic motifs and introduce two families
of coefficients of: (1) structural similarity, which generalize local
clustering and closure coefficients and capture the full spectrum of
similarity-driven structures; (2) structural complementarity, defined
analogously but based on quadrangles instead of triangles. Using multiple
social and biological networks, we demonstrate that the coefficients capture
structural properties related to meaningful domain-specific phenomena. We show
that they allow distinguishing between different kinds of social relations as
well as measuring an increasing structural diversity of PPI networks across the
tree of life. Our results indicate that some types of relations are better
explained by complementarity than homophily, and may be useful for improving
existing link prediction methods. We also introduce a Python package

neuroplastic graph attention network based on residual graph attention layers
and concurrent optimization of the graph structure representing multiple
magnification levels of the histopathological image. The modification of graph
structure, which generates the node features by projection, is as important to
the architecture as the graph neural network itself. It determines the possible

by spin filtering -- and spin currents with a spin polarization component
perpendicular to the channel interface. This would enable high-performance
devices based on sub-20 nm diameter perpendicularly magnetized MTJ nanopillars
without need of a symmetry breaking field. We also discuss MRAM characteristics
essential for CMOS integration. Finally, we identify critical research needs
for charge-to-spin conversion measurements and metrics that can be used to
optimize device channel materials and interface properties prior to full MTJ

discrete element modeling simulations for systems varying in size from 300 to
100,000 particles. The volume fraction and shear stress ratio $\mu$ are
relatively insensitive to system size fo a wide range of inertial numbers $I$.
Second-order effects in strain rate, such as second normal stress differences,
require large system sizes to accurately extract meaningful results, notably a
non-monotonic dependence in the first normal stress difference with strain
rate. The first-order rheological response represented by the $\mu(I)$
relationship works well at describing the lower-order aspects of the rheology,
except near the quasi-static limit of these stress-controlled flows. The
pressure is varied over five decades, and a pressure dependence of the
coordination number is observed, which is not captured by the inertial number.
Large fluctuations observed for small systems $N\le$ 1,000 near the
quasi-static limit can lead to arrest of flow resulting in challenges to
fitting the data to rheological relationships. The inertial number is also
insufficient for capturing the pressure-dependent behavior of property
fluctuations. Fluctuations in the flow and microstructural properties are
measured in both the quasi-static and inertial regimes, including shear stress,
pressure, strain rate, normal stress differences, volume fraction, coordination
number and contact fabric anisotropy. The fluctuations in flow properties scale
self-similarly with pressure and system size. A transition in the scaling of
fluctuations of stress properties and contact fabric anisotropy are measured
and proposed as a quantitative identification of the transition from inertial
to quasi-static flow.

take advantage of the similarity between the adjacent pixels of a local

Then, the sampled images are sent to the network for feature aggregation. In
addition, we use an improved recursive training algorithm to further improve
the extraction accuracy, making the water boundary more natural. Furthermore,
our method utilizes neighboring features instead of global or local features to

storage of telecom photonic qubits is a fundamental request for such networking

on-demand retrieval of telecom photonic qubits using a laser-written waveguide
fabricated in an $^{167}$Er$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystal. Both ends of the
waveguide memory are directly connected with fiber arrays with a fiber-to-fiber
efficiency of 51%. Storage fidelity of 98.3(1)% can be obtained for time-bin
qubits encoded with single-photon-level coherent pulses, which is far beyond
the maximal fidelity that can be achieved with a classical measure and prepare
strategy. This device features high reliability, easy scalability and can be
directly integrated into fiber networks, which could play an essential role in
fiber-based quantum networks.

is developed by generalizing the formulation proposed in [J. Phys. A50, 325001

perturbatively which is applicable to systems with degeneracy in the
eigenvalues of the Fokker-Planck operator. This method enables us to study how
the geometrical symmetry affects thermodynamic description of a Brownian
particle. To illustrate the application of the derived theory, we consider the
Fokker-Planck equation with a two-dimensional harmonic potential. To
investigate the effect of symmetry of the potential, we study thermodynamic
properties in symmetric and asymmetric deformation processes of the potential:
the rotational symmetry of the harmonic potential is held in the former, but it
is broken in the latter. Optimized deformations in these processes are defined
by minimizing mean works. Comparing these optimized processes, we find that the
difference between the symmetric and asymmetric processes is maximized when the
deformation time of the potential is given by a critical time which is
characterized by the relaxation time of the Fokker-Planck equation. This
critical time in the mean work is smaller than that of the change of the mean
energy because of the hysteresis effect in the irreversible processes.

field orientation. However, the exact physical processes that result in a
coherent large-scale grain alignment are far from being constrained. Aims: In
this work, we aim to investigate the impact of a gas-dust drift leading to a
mechanical alignment of dust (MAD) and to dust polarization. Methods: We
explore fractal dust aggregates to statistically analyze the average alignment
behavior of distinct grain ensembles. The spin-up efficiencies for individual
aggregates are determined utilizing MC simulations. These efficiencies are
analyzed to identify stable points for the grain alignment in direction of the
gas-dust drift and along the magnetic field lines. Finally, the net dust
polarization is calculated per grain ensemble. Results: The mechanical spin-up
within the CNM is sufficient to drive grains to a stable alignment. A likely
mechanical grain alignment is parallel to the drift direction. All grains can
align at subsonic conditions. Here, we predict a polarization efficiency in the
order of unity for the MAD. A supersonic drift may result in a rapid rotation
where dust grains may become rotationally disrupted and the polarization
becomes drastically reduced. In the presence of a magnetic field, the drift
required for the alignment of elongated grains is roughly one order of
magnitude higher compared to the pure MAD. Here, the dust polarization
efficiency is 0.6-0.9 indicating that a drift can provide the prerequisites to
probe the magnetic field. The alignment is inefficient when the direction of
the drift and the field lines are perpendicular. Conclusions: We find that MAD
has to be taken into consideration as an alternative driving mechanism where
the standard RAT alignment theory fails to account for the full spectrum of
available dust polarization observations.

ejections. These events are driven by the release of energy stored in coronal
magnetic fields, generated by the stellar dynamo. However, it remains unclear
if the energy deposition in the magnetic fields is driven by direct or
alternating currents. Recently, we presented observational measurements of the
flare intensity distributions for a sample of $\sim10^5$ stars across the main
sequence observed by $\textit{TESS}$, all of which exhibited power-law
distributions similar to those observed in the Sun, albeit with varying slopes.
Here we investigate the mechanisms required to produce such a distribution of
flaring events via direct current energy deposition, in which coronal magnetic
fields braid, reconnect, and produce flares. We adopt a topological model for
this process which produces a power-law distribution of energetic flaring
events. We expand this model to include the Coriolis effect, which we
demonstrate produces a shallower distribution of flare energies in stars that
rotate more rapidly (corresponding to a weaker decline in occurrence rates
toward increasing flare energies). We present tentative evidence for the
predicted rotation-power-law index correlation in the observations. We advocate
for future observations of stellar flares that would improve our measurements
of the power-law exponents, and yield key insights into the underlying dynamo
mechanisms that underpin the self-similar flare intensity distributions.

the immersed boundary method originally developed by Kajishima et al. [1],
which accounts for the inertia of the fictitious fluid inside the particle
volume and is thus able to reproduce the behaviour of particles both in the
case of neutrally-buoyant objects and in the presence of density difference
between the particles and the fluid. The method is capable to handle the
presence of multiple suspended objects, i.e., a suspension, by including a
soft-sphere normal collision model, while the lubrication correction typically
added to similar immersed boundary methods in order to capture the sub-grid
unresolved lubrication force is here treated implicitly, i.e., naturally
obtained without any explicit expression, thus no additional computation is
required. We show that our methodology can successfully reproduce the rheology
of a particle suspension in a shear flow up to a dense regime (with a maximum
particle volume fraction around 46%) without any additional correction force.
The applicability of this methodology is also tested in a turbulent

connected to time and timing. In service of generating and receiving signals,
humans and other animals are known to represent time, determine time since past
events, predict the time until a future stimulus, and both recognize and
generate patterns that unfold in time. We investigate how different temporal
processes impact coordination and signalling between learning agents by
introducing a partially observable decision-making domain we call the Frost
Hollow. In this domain, a prediction learning agent and a reinforcement
learning agent are coupled into a two-part decision-making system that works to
acquire sparse reward while avoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two
domain variations: machine agents interacting in a seven-state linear walk, and
human-machine interaction in a virtual-reality environment. Our results
showcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian signalling, the impact that
different temporal representations do (and do not) have on agent-agent
coordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent and human-agent
interactions differently. As a main contribution, we establish Pavlovian
signalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and fully
adaptive communication learning between two agents. We further show how to
computationally build this adaptive signalling process out of a fixed
signalling process, characterized by fast continual prediction learning and
minimal constraints on the nature of the agent receiving signals. Our results
therefore suggest an actionable, constructivist path towards communication
learning between reinforcement learning agents.

but require long acquisition times, precluding its widespread use for early
diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. To reduce the acquisition times,
reconstruction methods from undersampled measurements are routinely used, that
leverage representations designed to increase image compressibility.
  Reconstructed anatomical and hemodynamic images may present visual artifacts.
Although some of these artifact are essentially reconstruction errors, and thus
a consequence of undersampling, others may be due to measurement noise or the
random choice of the sampled frequencies. Said otherwise, a reconstructed image
becomes a random variable, and both its bias and its covariance can lead to
visual artifacts; the latter leads to spatial correlations that may be
misconstrued for visual information. Although the nature of the former has been
studied in the literature, the latter has not received as much attention.
  In this study, we investigate the theoretical properties of the random
perturbations arising from the reconstruction process, and perform a number of
numerical experiments on simulated and MR aortic flow. Our results show that
the correlation length remains limited to two to three pixels when a Gaussian
undersampling pattern is combined with recovery algorithms based on
$\ell_1$-norm minimization. However, the correlation length may increase
significantly for other undersampling patterns, higher undersampling factors
(i.e., 8x or 16x compression), and different reconstruction methods.

increase utility in market incompleteness. The new insights are also
transferable to more advanced stochastic settings. The analysis relies on the
infinite number of optimal choices of derivatives for a maximized expected

simplicity, we demonstrate that only two derivatives are needed to maximize
utility while minimizing risky exposure. In a comparison among one-asset

the deepest out-of-the-money Asian products available are the best choices to
minimize exposure. We also explore optimal selections among straddles, which
are better practical choices than out-of-the-money Calls and Puts due to

Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE) is an efficient PYTHON code for
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of galaxies and active galactic

developed to account for AGN/galaxy X-ray emission and improve AGN modeling at
UV-to-IR wavelengths. Here, we apply X-CIGALE to different samples, including
COSMOS spectroscopic type 2 AGNs, CDF-S X-ray detected normal galaxies, SDSS
quasars, and COSMOS radio objects. From these tests, we identify several
weaknesses of X-CIGALE and improve the code accordingly. These improvements are
mainly related to AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy, X-ray binary emission, AGN
accretion-disk SED shape, and AGN radio emission. These updates improve the fit
quality and allow new interpretation of the results, based on which we discuss
physical implications. For example, we find that AGN intrinsic X-ray anisotropy
is moderate, and can be modeled as $L_X(\theta) \propto 1+\cos \theta$, where
$\theta$ is the viewing angle measured from the AGN axis. We merge the new code

divergence form elliptic operator having real-valued, bounded, measurable
coefficients on $L^2(\Omega)$ with the Dirichlet boundary condition. The main
aim of this article is threefold. First, the authors prove that the heat
kernels $\{K_t^{L_D}\}_{t>0}$ generated by $L_D$ are H\""older continuous.
Second, for any $p\in(0,1]$, the authors introduce the `geometrical' Hardy
space $H^p_r(\Omega)$ by restricting any element of the Hardy space
$H^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ to $\Omega$, and show that, when
$p\in(\frac{n}{n+\delta_0},1]$, $H^p_r(\Omega)=H^p(\Omega)=H^p_{L_D}(\Omega)$
with equivalent quasi-norms, where $H^p(\Omega)$ and $H^p_{L_D}(\Omega)$
respectively denote the Hardy space on $\Omega$ and the Hardy space associated
with $L_D$, and $\delta_0\in(0,1]$ is the critical index of the H\""older
continuity for the kernels $\{K_t^{L_D}\}_{t>0}$. Third, as applications, the
authors obtain the global gradient estimates in both $L^p(\Omega)$, with
$p\in(1,p_0)$, and $H^p_z(\Omega)$, with $p\in(\frac{n}{n+1},1]$, for the
inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem of second-order divergence form elliptic
equations on bounded NTA domains, where $p_0\in(2,\infty)$ is a constant
depending only on $n$, $\Omega$, and the coefficient matrix of $L_D$. It is
worth pointing out that the range $p\in(1,p_0)$ for the global gradient
estimate in the scale of Lebesgue spaces $L^p(\Omega)$ is sharp and the above
results are established without any additional assumptions on both the
coefficient matrix of $L_D$, and the domain $\Omega$.

numerical simulations of real-world wave propagation demonstrating impact.
Stable and parallel implementations of the PML in the high performance

the computational domain of seismological problems with only a few grid
points/elements around the computational boundaries where the PML is active,
thus saving as much as $96\%$ of the required computational resources for a
three space dimensional seismological benchmark problem.

prevalent. Large-scale online services often share or replicate their data into
multiple data centers (DCs) in different geographic regions. Driven by the data
communication need of these applications, inter-datacenter network (IDN) is
getting increasingly important.
  However, we find congestion control for inter-datacenter networks quite
challenging. Firstly, the inter-datacenter communication involves both data
center networks (DCNs) and wide-area networks (WANs) connecting multiple data
centers. Such a network environment presents quite heterogeneous
characteristics (e.g., buffer depths, RTTs). Existing congestion control
mechanisms consider either DCN or WAN congestion, while not simultaneously
capturing the degree of congestion for both.
  Secondly, to reduce evolution cost and improve flexibility, large enterprises
have been building and deploying their wide-area routers based on
shallow-buffered switching chips. However, with legacy congestion control
mechanisms (e.g., TCP Cubic), shallow buffer can easily get overwhelmed by
large BDP (bandwidth-delay product) wide-area traffic, leading to high packet
losses and degraded throughput.
  This thesis describes my research efforts on optimizing congestion control
mechanisms for the inter-datacenter networks. First, we design GEMINI - a
practical congestion control mechanism that simultaneously handles congestions
both in DCN andWAN. Second, we present FlashPass - a proactive congestion
control mechanism that achieves near zero loss without degrading throughput
under the shallow-buffered WAN. Extensive evaluation shows their superior
performance over existing congestion control mechanisms.

of thin film size effects is seen in setting the magnitude of static

(\leq 8 nm). The film thickness dependence of magnetization parameters
indicates the presence of a magnetically disordered region at the
film-substrate interface, which may promote preferential flow of spins
generated by the precessing magnetization towards the substrate. However, the
V_{dc} signal also draws contributions from rectification effects of a \approx
0.4 \% anisotropic magnetoresistance and a large (\approx 54 n\Omega.m)
anomalous Hall resistivity (AHR) of these films which ride over the effect of
spin-orbit coupling driven spin-to-charge conversion near the film-substrate

mapping user's workflows and behaviors to their higher-level motivations,

numerous taxonomies to facilitate this mapping process, no formal methods exist
for systematically applying these existing theories to user interaction logs.
This paper seeks to bridge the gap between visualization task taxonomies and
interaction log data by making the taxonomies more actionable for interaction
log analysis. To achieve this, we leverage structural parallels between how
people express themselves through interactions and language by reformulating
existing theories as regular grammars. We represent interactions as terminals
within a regular grammar, similar to the role of individual words in a
language, and patterns of interactions or non-terminals as regular expressions
over these terminals to capture common language patterns. To demonstrate our
approach, we generate regular grammars for seven visualization taxonomies and
develop code to apply them to three interaction log datasets. In analyzing our
results, we find that existing taxonomies at the low-level (i.e., terminals)
show mixed results in expressing multiple interaction log datasets, and
taxonomies at the high-level (i.e., regular expressions) have limited
expressiveness, due to primarily two challenges: inconsistencies in interaction
log dataset granularity and structure, and under-expressiveness of certain
terminals. Based on our findings, we suggest new research directions for the
visualization community for augmenting existing taxonomies, developing new
ones, and building better interaction log recording processes to facilitate the

supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy, temporarily increasing the
accretion rate onto the black hole and producing a bright flare across the
electromagnetic spectrum. Radio observations of TDEs trace outflows and jets
that may be produced. Radio detections of the outflows from TDEs are uncommon,
with only about one third of TDEs discovered to date having published radio
detections. Here we present over two years of comprehensive, multi-radio
frequency monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh taken
with the Very Large Array (VLA) and MeerKAT radio telescopes from approximately
10 days pre-optical peak to 810 days post-optical peak. AT2019azh shows unusual
radio emission for a thermal TDE, as it brightened very slowly over two years,
and showed fluctuations in the synchrotron energy index of the optically thin
synchrotron emission from 450 days post-disruption. Based on the radio
properties, we deduce that the outflow in this event is likely non-relativistic
and could be explained by a spherical outflow arising from self-stream
intersections, or a mildly collimated outflow from accretion onto the
supermassive black hole. This data-set provides a significant contribution to
the observational database of outflows from TDEs, including the earliest radio
detection of a non-relativistic TDE to date, relative to the optical discovery.

parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this

We show that this model can produce a Band shape spectrum, whose parameters
($E_p$, $\alpha$, $\beta$) could distribute in the typical distribution from
GRB observations, as long as the magnetic field and the electron acceleration
process in the emission region are under appropriate conditions. On the other
hand, we show that for one ICMART event, $E_p$ evolution is always a
hard-to-soft pattern. However, a GRB light curve is usually composed of
multiple ICMART events that are fundamentally driven by the erratic GRB central
engine activity. In this case, we find that if one individual broad pulse in
the GRB light curve is composed of multiple ICMART events, the overall $E_p$
evolution could be disguised as the intense-tracking pattern. Therefore, mixed
$E_p$ evolution patterns can coexist in the same burst, with a variety of
combined patterns. Our results support the ICMART model to be a competitive

unclear, although it seems to be related to its explosion mechanism. X-ray
observations of the characteristic structures could provide us useful
information on the explosive nucleosynthesis via the observation of elements,
which is a unique approach to understand its origin. We here report the
discovery of shocked stable Ti, which is produced only at the inner region of
exploding stars, in the northeast jet of Cassiopeia A using the 1-Ms deep
observation with the Chandra X-ray observatory. The observed Ti coexists with
other intermediate-mass elements (e.g. Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe at the tip of the
X-ray jet structure. We found that its elemental composition is well explained
with the production by the incomplete Si burning regime, indicating that the
formation process of the jet structure was sub-energetic at the explosion (the
peak temperature during the nuclear burning must be $\lesssim$
5$\times$10$^{9}$ K at most). Thus, we conclude that the energy source that
formed the jet structure was not the primary engine for the supernova
explosion. Our results are useful to limit the power of the jet-structure
formation process, and a weak jet mechanism with low temperature may be needed
to explain it.

methods for SLAM and RA have appeared in the literature, these are typically
obtained as purely heuristic approximations, making it difficult to determine
whether (or under what circumstances) these techniques can be reliably
deployed. In contrast, in this work we study the problem of initialization
through the lens of spectral relaxation. Specifically, we derive a simple
spectral relaxation of SLAM and RA, the form of which enables us to exploit
classical linear-algebraic techniques (eigenvector perturbation bounds) to
control the distance from our spectral estimate to both the (unknown)
ground-truth and the global minimizer of the estimation problem as a function
of measurement noise. Our results reveal the critical role that spectral
graph-theoretic properties of the measurement network play in controlling
estimation accuracy; moreover, as a by-product of our analysis we obtain new
bounds on the estimation error for the maximum likelihood estimators in SLAM
and RA, which are likely to be of independent interest. Finally, we show
experimentally that our spectral estimator is very effective in practice,
producing initializations of comparable or superior quality at lower
computational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

timeadaptivity and symplecticity in the numerical integration can result in a
significant gain in computational efficiency. It is however well known that
symplectic integrators lose their near energy preservation properties when
variable time-steps are used. The most common approach to circumvent this
problem involves the Poincare transformation on the Hamiltonian side, and was
used in Duruisseaux et al. (2021) to construct efficient explicit algorithms
for symplectic accelerated optimization. However, the current formulations of
Hamiltonian variational integrators do not make intrinsic sense on more general
spaces such as Riemannian manifolds and Lie groups. In contrast, Lagrangian
variational integrators are well-defined on manifolds, so we develop here a
framework for time-adaptivity in Lagrangian variational integrators and use the
resulting geometric integrators to solve optimization problems on normed vector

Our micromagnetic simulations and analytical results demonstrate that spin

two parts, Efficient Non-Local Attention (ENLA) and Sparse Aggregation. ENLA
adopts the kernel method to approximate exponential function and obtains linear

amplification factor to focus on informative features, yet the variance of
approximation increases exponentially. Therefore, contrastive learning is
applied to further separate relevant and irrelevant features. To demonstrate
the effectiveness of ENLCA, we build an architecture called Efficient Non-Local

which early detection and treatment are very important. Fundus images and
optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are both widely-used modalities in
diagnosing glaucoma. However, existing glaucoma grading approaches mainly
utilize a single modality, ignoring the complementary information between
fundus and OCT. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-modality
supervised contrastive learning framework, named COROLLA, for glaucoma grading.
Through layer segmentation as well as thickness calculation and projection,
retinal thickness maps are extracted from the original OCT volumes and used as
a replacing modality, resulting in more efficient calculations with less memory
usage. Given the high structure and distribution similarities across medical
image samples, we employ supervised contrastive learning to increase our
models' discriminative power with better convergence. Moreover, feature-level
fusion of paired fundus image and thickness map is conducted for enhanced
diagnosis accuracy. On the GAMMA dataset, our COROLLA framework achieves
overwhelming glaucoma grading performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

investigate the multi-band non-thermal radiation from the Crab pulsar wind

Then we use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) sampling technology and method

generated by the electrons and protons in the Crab nebula. The modeling results
indicate that the pure leptonic origin model with the one-zone only can partly
agree with some segments of the data from various experiments (including the
$\rm PeV$ gamma-ray emission reported by the LHAASO and the other radiation
ranging from the radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray waveband), and the
contribution of hadronic interaction is hardly constrained. However, we find
that the hadronic process may also contribute, especially in the energy range
exceeding the $\rm PeV$. In addition, it can be inferred that the higher energy

utilizing acoustic pressure and local heat release rate fluctuations. We
observe the transition to thermoacoustic instability for these experiments as
we decrease the equivalence ratio towards a fuel-lean setting. More
importantly, we observe significant growth of local heat release rate
fluctuations near the bluff-body well before the appearance of large-scale
spatial or temporal patterns during the occurrence of thermoacoustic
instability. By strategically positioning slots (perforations) on the
bluff-body, we ensure the reduction of the growth of local heat release rate
fluctuations at the stagnation zone near the bluff-body at operating conditions
far away from the onset of thermoacoustic instability. This reduction in the
local heat release rate fluctuations ensures that the transition to
thermoacoustic instability is avoided. We find that modified configurations of
the bluff-body that do not quench these local heat release rate fluctuations at
the stagnation zone results in the transition to thermoacoustic instability. We
also reveal that an effective suppression strategy based on the growth of local
heat release rate fluctuations requires an optimization of the area ratio of
the slots for a given bluff-body position. Further, the suppression strategy
also depends on the spatial distribution of perforations on the bluff-body.
Notably, an inappropriate distribution of the slots which does not quench the
local heat release rate fluctuations at the stagnation zone may even result in
a dramatic increase in amplitudes of pressure oscillations.

been a challenge because, unlike the general domain adaptive tasks, there is no
overlap between the classes of source and target domain data in the person
re-ID, which leads to a significant domain gap. State-of-the-art unsupervised
re-ID methods train the neural networks using a memory-based contrastive loss.
However, performing contrastive learning by treating each unlabeled instance as
a class will lead to the problem of class collision, and the updating intensity
is inconsistent due to the difference in the number of instances of different
categories when updating in the memory bank. To address such problems, we
propose Prototype Dictionary Learning for person re-ID which is able to utilize
both source domain data and target domain data by one training stage while
avoiding the problem of class collision and the problem of updating intensity
inconsistency by cluster-level prototype dictionary learning. In order to
reduce the interference of domain gap on the model, we propose a local-enhance
module to improve the domain adaptation of the model without increasing the
number of model parameters. Our experiments on two large datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the prototype dictionary learning. 71.5\% mAP is achieved
in the Market-to-Duke task, which is a 2.3\% improvement compared to the
state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptive re-ID methods. It achieves 83.9\%

leading to erroneous equivalent rock mass responses. To fill in this gap, an
intact rock bridge was dispersed as multi rock bridges while maintaining a
constant joint persistence, subjected to direct shear by conducting numerical
simulations employing Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC). In this way,
scale effects of rock bridges were investigated from the perspective of
load-displacement curves, stress and displacement fields, crack propagations
and AE characterizations. Results revealed that the shear resistance and the
area and value of stress-concentration decreased with increasing dispersion.
Furthermore, uneven distribution of displacement fields in an arc manner moving

failure of multi rock bridges. It was also found that the propagation of wing
cracks was insensitive to scale, while the asperity of macro shear fracture
mainly formed by secondary cracks decreased with increasing dispersion. In
addition, increasing dispersion of rock bridges would overlap the failure
precursors identified by intense AE activities. Based on the abovementioned
results, we evaluated existing methods to characterize the joint persistence,

observational data. Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for causal
effect estimation when there exist latent confounders. With the standard IV
method, when a given IV is valid, unbiased estimation can be obtained, but the
validity requirement of standard IV is strict and untestable. Conditional IV
has been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IV by conditioning on a
set of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV).
However, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV
needs complete causal structure knowledge or a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
representing the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved
variables. This makes it impossible to discover a conditioning set directly
from data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) in
causal inference with latent variables, we propose a new type of IV, ancestral
IV in MAG, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the
conditioning set for a given ancestral IV in MAG. Based on the theory, we
develop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with an ancestral IV

of the environment while simultaneously attempting the localisation of the
robot. It relies on scan matching algorithms to align noisy observations along
robot's movements to compute an estimate of the current robot's location. We
propose a fundamentally different approach to scan matching tasks to improve
the estimation of roto-translation displacements and therefore the performance
of the full SLAM algorithm. A Monte-Carlo approach is used to generate weighted
hypotheses of the geometrical displacement between two scans, and then we
cluster these hypotheses to compute the displacement that results in the best
alignment. To cope with clusterization on roto-translations, we propose a novel
clustering approach that robustly extends Gaussian Mean-Shift to orientations
by factorizing the kernel density over the roto-translation components. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an extensive set of experiments
using both synthetic data and the Intel Research Lab's benchmarking datasets.
The results confirms that our approach has superior performance in terms of
matching accuracy and runtime computation than the state-of-the-art iterative
point-based scan matching algorithms.

popularity, Bluetooth low energy (BLE) has been used to detect proximity based
on the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). To address the fact that RSSI
can be markedly influenced by device carriage states, previous works have
incorporated RSSI with inertial measurement unit (IMU) using deep learning.
However, they have not sufficiently accounted for the impact of multipath.
Furthermore, due to the special setup, the IMU data collected in the training

generalizability. This issue has not been studied before. We propose PRID, an
IMU-assisted BLE proximity detection approach robust against RSSI fluctuation

uses carriage state regularization to mitigate overfitting due to IMU data

substantially cut memory requirements for resource-constrained devices. We have
conducted extensive experiments under different multipath environments, data
bias levels, and a crowdsourced dataset. Our results show that PRID

However, the loss has been an unavoidable problem in practical applications and
greatly limits the use of interferometers. Visibility is an important parameter
to evaluate the sensing performance of interferometers. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate the mitigating effect of the loss on visibility of the SALHI via
asymmetric gain optimization, where the maximum threshold of loss to visibility
close to $100\%$ is increased. Furthermore, we theoretically find that the
optimal condition for the largest visibility is the same as that for the
enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to the best value in the presence of
losses using the intensity detection, indicating that the visibility can act as
an experimental operational criterion for SNR improvement in practical
applications. Improvement of the interference visibility means achievement of
SNR enhancement. Our results provide a significant foundation for practical

the cause of the low observed mobility in SiC MOSFETs; we establish this fact
by comparing the theoretically calculated mobility considering these effects
with experimental observations. By considering the threshold voltages and the
effective field dependence of the mobility in SiC MOSFETs, it is concluded that
the scattering centers of the dominant mechanism are electrically neutral and
exhibit a short-range scattering potential. By considering charge distribution
around a neutral defect at the interface, it is established that an electric
dipole induced by the defect can act as a short-range scattering potential. We
then calculate the mobility in SiC MOSFETs assuming that there exist a high
density of dipoles at the interface. The calculated dipole-scattering-limited
mobility shows a similar dependence on the effective field dependence to that
observed in experimental results. Thus, we conclude that scattering induced by
a high density of electric dipoles at the interface is dominant cause of the
low mobility in SiC MOSFETs.

issues of robustness need to be addressed. Along this line, we propose a formal
framework to evaluate word-level robustness. First, to study safe regions for a
model, we introduce robustness radius which is the boundary where the model can
resist any perturbation. As calculating the maximum robustness radius is
computationally hard, we estimate its upper and lower bound. We repurpose
attack methods as ways of seeking upper bound and design a pseudo-dynamic
programming algorithm for a tighter upper bound. Then verification method is
utilized for a lower bound. Further, for evaluating the robustness of regions
outside a safe radius, we reexamine robustness from another view:
quantification. A robustness metric with a rigorous statistical guarantee is
introduced to measure the quantification of adversarial examples, which
indicates the model's susceptibility to perturbations outside the safe radius.
The metric helps us figure out why state-of-the-art models like BERT can be
easily fooled by a few word substitutions, but generalize well in the presence

interface of two immiscible fluids is studied by means of molecular dynamics
simulations. For three topologically different chains, namely, linear, ring,
and trefoil-knot of same molecular weight the effect of varying both
polymer--fluid and fluid--fluid interaction nature on the width of the fluid
interface, chain conformation, shape, and chain dynamics. For sharp-interface
binary-fluid system, the interface width is insensitive to both topology and
polymer-fluid interaction nature, while a weak non-monotonic variation is seen
for weak-interface system. Chain extension normal to the interface plane is
significantly affected by the topology with trefoil-knot chain, due to the
additional constraint, has the largest value compared to both linear and ring
polymers. Instantaneous shapes are also quantified through shape parameters.
Furthermore, it is observed that the qualitative behavior of center of mass
mean-square displacement (MSD) is independent of topology, i.e., all the chain
types show same diffusion exponent $\alpha~(\approx 1)$. However, the
self-diffusion constant depends on the topology and it is largest for
trefoil-knot chain. An interesting observation pertaining the early time
behavior of monomeric-MSD is that, within the sub-diffusive regime, the values
of $\alpha$ for different parameters (independent of topology) are grouped into
two distinct ranges (0.52--0.59 and 0.62--0.67) which is related to the
different chain conformation for polymer-fluid interaction range below and

the constraints of nuclear structure data of $^{208}$Pb and $^{120}$Sn. Under
the constraint of the neutron-skin thickness, it is found that incorporating
the curvature parameter $K_{sym}$ of nuclear symmetry energy as an independent
variable significantly broadens the posterior probability distribution function
(PDF) of the slope parameter $L$, and affects the related correlations.
Typically, the anticorrelation between $L$ and the symmetry energy at
saturation density disappears, while a positive correlation between $L$ and
$K_{sym}$ is observed. Under the constraint of the isoscalar giant monopole
resonance (ISGMR), incorporating the skewness parameter as an independent
variable also significantly broadens the posterior PDF of the nuclear matter
incompressibility $K_0$. Even with the broad uncertainties of higher-order
parameters of the equation of state (EOS), robust constraints of $L<90$ MeV and
$K_0<270$ MeV are obtained. Our study quantifies the consistency between the
constraints on $L$ from the neutron-skin data of PREXII and isovector giant
dipole resonance (IVGDR) data, and the constraints on $K_0$ from the data of
ISGMR in $^{208}$Pb and $^{120}$Sn.

formula, a perturbative expansion in powers of $1/Z$, and a single-active
electron approximation, and compare them with reference ionization rates
computed by the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF)

where the exchange interaction is neglected, results in the overestimation of
the ionization rates by 30\% for He and 2\% for He-like Kr, showing that the

photosphere has been investigated. To present, there is no study to show the
evolution of the coronal magnetic flux in the corona, nor the evolution of
solar cycle magnetic free energy. The paper aims to analyze the temporal
variation of the magnetic field and free magnetic energy in the solar corona
for the solar cycle 24 and how the magnetic field behaves in the two
hemispheres. We investigate if we can obtain better estimates of the magnetic
field at Earth using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation
method. To model the magnetic field over cycle 24 we apply the NLFFF
optimization method to the synoptic vector magnetic maps derived from the
observations of Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamic
Observatory (SDO). We found that during the solar cycle 24, the maximum of the
Sun's dynamics is different from the sunspot number (SSN) maximum peak. The
major contribution to the total unsigned flux is provided by the flux coming
from the magnetic field structures other than sunspots (MSOS) within latitudes
between -30 and +30 degrees. The magnetic flux variation during the solar cycle
24 shows a different evolution in the corona than in the photosphere. We found
a correlation value of 0.8 between the derived magnetic energy from our model
and the flare energy index derived from observations. On average, cycle 24 had
a higher number of sunspots in the northern hemisphere (NH) but stronger flux
in the southern hemisphere (SH) which could more effectively reach the higher
layers of the atmosphere. The coupling between the hemispheres increases with
height.

  Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) has been challenging due
to the existence of large discrepancies between visible and infrared
modalities. Most pioneering approaches reduce intra-class variations and
inter-modality discrepancies by learning modality-shared and ID-related
features. However, an explicit modality-shared cue, i.e., body keypoints, has
not been fully exploited in VI-ReID. Additionally, existing feature learning
paradigms imposed constraints on either global features or partitioned feature
stripes, which neglect the prediction consistency of global and part features.
To address the above problems, we exploit Pose Estimation as an auxiliary
learning task to assist the VI-ReID task in an end-to-end framework. By jointly
training these two tasks in a mutually beneficial manner, our model learns
higher quality modality-shared and ID-related features. On top of it, the
learnings of global features and local features are seamlessly synchronized by
Hierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC), where the former supervises the latter
using the knowledge distillation strategy. Experimental results on two
benchmark VI-ReID datasets show that the proposed method consistently improves
state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. Specifically, our method
achieves nearly 20$\%$ mAP improvements against the state-of-the-art method on
the RegDB dataset. Our intriguing findings highlight the usage of auxiliary
task learning in VI-ReID.

simply using them can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we take a
new route to learn to optimize the LiDAR beam configuration for a given
application. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based

The optimization is guided by the final performance of the target task and thus
our method can be integrated easily with any LiDAR-based application as a

FPGA-based research platform that enables accurate and fast exploration of
heterogeneous computers consisting of accelerators based on clusters of 32-bit
RISC-V cores and an application-class 64-bit ARMv8 or RV64 host processor.
HEROv2 allows to seamlessly share data between 64-bit hosts and 32-bit
accelerators and comes with a fully open-source on-chip network, a unified
heterogeneous programming interface, and a mixed-data-model, mixed-ISA
heterogeneous compiler based on LLVM. We evaluate HEROv2 in four case studies
from the application level over toolchain and system architecture down to
accelerator microarchitecture. We demonstrate how HEROv2 enables effective
research and development on the full stack of heterogeneous computing. For
instance, the compiler can tile loops and infer data transfers to and from the
accelerators, which leads to a speedup of up to 4.4x compared to the original
program and in most cases is only 15 % slower than a handwritten
implementation, which requires 2.6x more code.

fixed-size embedding from single reference audio. However, they face several
challenges: 1) the fixed-size speaker embedding is not powerful enough to

inconsistency between different speakers also leads to a degradation in the

adding the noisified wrench sequence prediction to the policy observations. The
policy then learns to counteract the partially-known future disturbance. The

Going further a first determination of the light and strange hadron spectrum

front-end and an automatic speech recognition (ASR) back-end is a widely used
approach to implement overlapping speech recognition. However, the SE front-end
generates processing artifacts that can degrade the ASR performance. We
previously found that such performance degradation can occur even under fully
overlapping conditions, depending on the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To mitigate the degradation, we introduced a
rule-based method to switch the ASR input between the enhanced and observed
signals, which showed promising results. However, the rule's optimality was
unclear because it was heuristically designed and based only on SIR and SNR
values. In this work, we propose a DNN-based switching method that directly
estimates whether ASR will perform better on the enhanced or observed signals.
We also introduce soft-switching that computes a weighted sum of the enhanced
and observed signals for ASR input, with weights given by the switching model's
output posteriors. The proposed learning-based switching showed performance
comparable to that of rule-based oracle switching. The soft-switching further
improved the ASR performance and achieved a relative character error rate
reduction of up to 23 % as compared with the conventional method.

external Gaussian random magnetic field with certain spatio-temporal
variations. Such thin ferrimagnetic systems exhibit compensation phenomenon and
thus are potentially interesting candidates for several technological
applications. Here, two distinct theoretical atoms, A and B make up the ABA and
AAB types of configurations in which the like atoms (A-A and B-B)
ferromagnetically interact and the unlike atoms (A-B) interact
antiferromagnetically. Depending upon the strength of the spatio-temporally
varying Gaussian random field, the compensation and critical points shift and
steady-state magnetic behaviours change between the different distinct types of
ferrimagnetic behaviours. The compensation phenomenon even vanishes after
crossing a finite threshold of the standard deviation of the magnetic field for
particular choices of the other controlling parameters. Consequently, in the
Hamiltonian parameter space of both configurations, islands of ferrimagnetic
phase without compensation appear within the phase area with compensation of
field-free case. The areas of such islands grow with an increasing standard
deviation of the external field, $\sigma$, obeying the scaling relation:
$f(\sigma, A(\sigma))=\sigma^{-b}A(\sigma)$ with $b_{ABA}=1.913\pm 0.137$ and

dense gas with low $X_{\rm CO}$ and high $R_{21}$. Adopting a constant $X_{\rm

algebraic methods are presented in order to prove Theorem A and Theorem B on
density of proper stable and topologically stable mappings $f:N^{n}\to P^{p}.$
Theorem A states that the set of proper stable maps is dense in the set of all
proper maps from $N$ to $P$, if and only if the pair $(n,p)$ is in \emph{nice
dimensions,} while Theorem B shows that density of topologically stable maps
holds for any pair $(n,p).$ A short review of results by du Plessis and Wall on
the range in which proper smooth mappings are $C^{1}$- stable is given. A
Thom-Mather map is a topologically stable map $f:N \to P$ whose associated
$k$-jet map $j^{k}f:N \to P$ is transverse to the Thom-Mather stratification in
$J^{k}(N,P).$ We give a detailed description of Thom-Mather maps for pairs
$(n,p)$ in the boundary of the nice dimensions.The main open question on
density of stable mappings is to determine the pairs $(n,p)$ for which
Lipschitz stable mappings are dense. We discuss recent results by Nguyen, Ruas
and Trivedi on this subject, formulating conjectures for the density of
Lipschitz stable mappings in the boundary of the nice dimensions. At the final
section, Damon's results relating $\mathcal{A}$-classification of map-germs and
$\mathcal{K}_{V}$ classification of sections of the discriminant $V=\Delta(F)$
of a stable unfolding of $f$ are reviewed and open problems are discussed.

Gaia data releases, permit not only the determination of asteroid size and
shape, but also the retrieval of additional, accurate astrometry, with a
possible relevant impact on the study of dynamical properties. The use of Gaia
as reference catalogue and the recent implementation of an improved error model
for occultation astrometry offer the opportunity to test its global astrometric
performance on the existing data set of observed events, dominated by minor
planets belonging to the main belt.
  Aims: We aim to explore the performance on orbit accuracy brought by reducing
occultations by stellar positions given in Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and Early
Data Release 3 (EDR3), exploited jointly with the new occultation error model.
Our goal is to verify that the quality of DR2 and EDR3 provides a logical
progression in the exploitation of occultation astrometry with respect to
previous catalogues. We also want to compare the post-fit residuals to the
error model.
  Methods: We began with accurate orbit adjustment to occultation data, either
alone or joined to the other available ground-based observations. We then
analyzed the orbit accuracy and the post-fit residuals.
  Results: Gaia EDR3 and DR2 bring a noticeable improvement to the accuracy of
occultation data, bringing an average reduction of their residuals upon fitting
an orbit of about a factor of 5 when compared to other catalogues. This is
particularly visible when occultations alone are used, resulting in very good
orbits for a large fraction of objects. We demonstrate that occultation
astrometry can reach the performance of Gaia on small asteroids. The joint use
of archival data and occultations remains more challenging due to the higher
uncertainties and systematic errors of other data, mainly obtained by
traditional CCD imaging.

the electron transitions between the valence and conduction size-quantized

crucial in order to achieve low latency. Recently, some load balancing policies
have been suggested which are able to achieve a bounded maximum queue length in
the large-scale limit. However, these policies have thus far only been studied
in case of exponential job sizes. As job sizes are more variable in real
systems, we investigate how the performance of these policies (and in
particular the value of these bounds) is impacted by the job size distribution.
  We present a unified analysis which can be used to compute the bound on the
queue length in case of phase-type distributed job sizes for four load
balancing policies. We find that in most cases, the bound on the maximum queue
length can be expressed in closed form. In addition, we obtain job size
(in)dependent bounds on the expected response time.
  Our methodology relies on the use of the cavity process. That is, we
conjecture that the cavity process captures the behaviour of the real system as
the system size grows large. For each policy, we illustrate the accuracy of the

Things (IoT), where a subset of a large population of users simultaneously
transmit small packets to a central base station. While there has been much
research on the design of protocols for massive access in the uplink, the
problem of providing message acknowledgments back to the users has been
somewhat neglected. Reliable communication needs to rely on two-way
communication for acknowledgement and retransmission. Nevertheless, because of
the many possible subsets of active users, providing acknowledgments requires a
significant amount of bits. Motivated by this, we define the problem of massive
ARQ (Automatic Retransmission reQuest) protocol and introduce efficient methods
for joint encoding of multiple acknowledgements in the downlink. The key idea
towards reducing the number of bits used for massive acknowledgements is to
allow for a small fraction of false positive acknowledgments. We analyze the
implications of this approach and the impact of acknowledgment errors in
scenarios with massive random access. Finally, we show that these savings can
lead to a significant increase in the reliability when retransmissions are
allowed since it allows the acknowledgment message to be transmitted more
reliably using a much lower rate.

Early-Type Galaxies (ETGs) hosting a central supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) is
conducted by means of high resolution hydrodynamical simulations performed with
our code MACER. Global properties such as 1) total SMBH accreted mass, 2) final
X-ray luminosity and temperature of the X-ray emitting halos, 3) total amount
of new stars formed from the cooling gas, 4) total ejected mass in form of
supernovae and AGN feedback induced galactic winds, are obtained as a function
of galaxy structure and internal dynamics. In addition to the galactic dark
matter halo, the model galaxies are also embedded in a group/cluster dark
matter halo; finally cosmological accretion is also included, with amount and
time dependence derived from cosmological simulations. Angular momentum
conservation leads to the formation of cold HI disks; these disks further
evolve under the action of star formation induced by disk instabilities, of the
associated mass discharge onto the central SMBH, and of the consequent AGN
feedback. At the end of the simulations, the hot (metal enriched) gas mass is
roughly $10\%$ the mass in the old stars, with twice as much having been
ejected into the intergalactic medium. The cold gas disks are a $\approx$ kpc
in size, and the metal rich new stars are in $0.1$ kpc disks. The masses of
cold gas and new stars are roughly $0.1\%$ the mass of the old stars. Overall,
the final systems appear to reproduce quite successfully the main global
properties of real ETGs.

  consumption and delay in WSNs",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sink mobility is seen as a successful strategy to resolve the hotspot problem
in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). Mobile sinks roam in the network and collect
data from special nodes such as Cluster Heads (CH) by means of short-range
communications which improves the energy efficiency. Numerous mobile sink based
routing protocols have been proposed, however, they incur high delays
especially in large scale networks where the mobile sink has to travel for a
long distance to collect data from CHs and consequently they failed to ensure a
tradeoff between energy efficiency and delay. To resolve this issue, we propose
in this paper an Effective Hybrid Routing Protocol termed as EHRP. The main aim
of this protocol is to combine between single-hop and multi-hop routing.
Indeed, when the mobile sink arrives at a cluster it collects its data while
the other distant CHs continue to send their data using our proposed improved
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to avoid the waiting-time. The existing
ACO algorithms use in the distance heuristic which is not practical in real
world and fail to consider relevant statistic information of energy (e.g.,
minimum energy, average energy) in path selection which leads to unbalanced
energy consumption in the network. To address these issues, the proposed
routing algorithm employs the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and
statistic information of energy to consume energy efficiently and decrease the
probability of sending failure. The performance of the proposed routing
protocol is tested and compared with those of the relevant routing protocols.
The simulation results show that, in comparison with its counterparts, EHRP
succeeds to minimize energy consumption and delay as well as enhancing the
packet delivery ratio.

long-standing challenging problem, which has received extensive attention from
both mathematicians and computer scientists. Related applications can be found
in various fields such as delegated computation, sum of Hermitian squares

  In this paper, we show that by performing the fast (inverse) Fourier
transform and finding a local minimal Fourier support, we are able to compute a
sparse FSOS certificate of $f$ on $G$ with complexity $O(|G|\log |G| + |G| t^4

the FSOS sparsity $t$ of $f$. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
algorithm by numerical experiments on various abelian groups of order up to
$10^6$. It is also noticeable that different choices of group structures on $X$
would result in different FSOS sparsities of $F$. Along this line, we
investigate upper bounds for FSOS sparsities with respect to different choices
of group structures, which generalize and refine existing results in the
literature. More precisely, \emph{(i)} we give an upper bound for FSOS
sparsities of nonnegative functions on the product and the quotient of two

different levels for the bidomain model of cardiac electro-physiology. The
first level associated with the mesoscopic structure such that the cardiac
tissue consists of extracellular and intracellular domains separated by an
interface (the sarcolemma). The second one related to the microscopic structure
in such a way that the intracellular medium can only be viewed as a periodical
layout of unit cells (mitochondria). At the interface between intra-and
extracellular media, the fluxes are given by nonlinear functions of ionic and
applied currents. A rigorous homogenization process based on unfolding
operators is applied to derive the macroscopic (homogenized) model from our
meso-microscopic bidomain model. We apply a three-scale unfolding method in the
intracellular problem to obtain its homogenized equation at two levels. The
first level upscaling of the intracellular structure yields the mesoscopic
equation. The second step of the homogenization leads to obtain the
intracellular homogenized equation. To prove the convergence of the nonlinear
terms, especially those defined on the microscopic interface, we use the
boundary unfolding method and a Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness's result. Next, we
use the standard unfolding method to homogenize the extracellular problem.
Finally, we obtain, at the limit, a reaction-diffusion system on a single
domain (the superposition of the intracellular and extracellular media) which
contains the homogenized equations depending on three scales. Such a model is
widely used for describing the macroscopic behavior of the cardiac tissue,
which is recognized to be an important messengers between the cytoplasm

covariate domain. Parameter roughness is regulated to provide optimal
predictive performance, assessed using cross-validation, within a penalised

bootstrap resampling. The models are used to estimate extremes of storm peak
significant wave height with respect to direction and season for a site in the

laser-physics researches, in which both the peak power improvement and
operating safety are very important meanwhile limited by the damage threshold
and size of compression gratings currently. Based on a recent reported method
""multistep pulse compressor (MPC)"", a multistage smoothing based MPC (MS-MPC)
is proposed here to further improve the running safety, operating convenience,
and simplify the whole setup of the MPC. In this optimized design, the beam
smoothing is not simply executed in the pre-compressor or main-compressor, but
separated into multistage. Then, it can protect important optics in every stage
directly and reduce the executing difficult of typical MPC at the same time.
The prism pair based pre-compressor will induce suitable spatial dispersion
which is easier to be achieved and enough to protect the first grating
directly. At the same time, the asymmetric four-grating compressor (AFGC) will
also induce spatial dispersion to further smooth the laser beam which helps to
protect the last grating directly. In this way, 10s-100s PW lasers can be
compressed by using current available optics with improved operating safety
owing to remove random spatial intensity modulations. Furthermore, an
additional beam smoothing stage can be added before the main amplifier to
protect the biggest amplification crystal away from damage. This MS-MPC optical
design can be easily extended to be used in all exist PW laser facilities to
improve their potential compressed pulse energy and running safety.

T_{\psi(g)} f_2.$$ In the case where $G$ is finitely-generated, the
characteristic factor for such averages is the \emph{Kronecker factor}. In this
paper, we study actions of groups that are not necessarily finitely-generated,

are applicable to a general class of compressors with bounded relative

Specifically, we show that they can find first-order stationary points with
sublinear convergence rate $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ when each local cost function is
smooth, where $T$ is the total number of iterations, and find global optima
with linear convergence rate under an additional condition that the global cost

fuel-lean H2/O2/Ar mixtures with water mists are studied with
Eulerian-Lagrangian method. The effects of water droplet mass flow rate on flow
and chemical structures in the induction zone, as well as physical / chemical
roles of water vapor, are investigated. The results show that the oblique
detonation wave (ODW) can stand in a range of water mass flow rates for both
stoichiometric and fuel-lean mixtures. With increased droplet mass flow rate,
the deflagration front in the induction zone is distorted and becomes
zigzagged, but the transition mode from oblique shock wave (OSW) to ODW does
not change. Moreover, the initiation and transition locations monotonically
increase, and the OSW and ODW angles decrease, due to droplet evaporation and
water vapor dilution in the induction region. For fuel-lean mixtures, the
sensitivity of characteristic locations to the droplet loading variations is
mild, which signifies better intrinsic stability and resilience to the oncoming
water droplets. The chemical explosiveness of the gaseous mixture between the
lead shock and reaction front is studied with the chemical explosive method
analysis. The smooth transition is caused by the highly enhanced reactivity of
the gas immediately behind the curved shock, intensified by the compression
waves. Nonetheless, the abrupt transition results from the intersection between
the beforehand generated detonation wave in the induction zone and OSW.
Besides, the degree to which the gas chemical reactivity in the induction zone
for fuel-lean mixtures is reduced by evaporating droplets is generally lower
than that for stoichiometric gas. Also, physical and chemical effects of water
vapor from liquid droplets result in significant differences in ODW initiation
and morphology.

  V. G. Bardakov and V. Gubarev showed that with each Rota-Baxter operator one
can associate a skew brace. Skew braces on a group $G$ can be characterised in
terms of certain gamma functions from $G$ to its automorphism group
$\operatorname{Aut}(G)$, that are defined by a functional equation. For the
skew braces obtained from a Rota-Baxter operator the corresponding gamma
functions take values in the inner automorphism group $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$

  In this paper, we give a characterisation of the gamma functions on a group
$G$, with values in $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$, that come from a Rota-Baxter
operator, in terms of the vanishing of a certain element in a suitable second
cohomology group.
  Exploiting this characterisation, we are able to exhibit examples of skew
braces whose corresponding gamma functions take values in the inner
automorphism group, but cannot be obtained from a Rota--Baxter operator.
  For gamma functions that can be obtained from a Rota-Baxter operators, we
show how to get the latter from the former, exploiting the knowledge that a
suitable central group extension splits.

sequence stage, but the physical processes that lead to it remain elusive. The
study of Ap stars that have rotation periods of tens to hundreds of years
represents a promising avenue to gain additional insight into the origin and
evolution of rotation in Ap stars.
  Historically, almost all the longest period Ap stars known have been found to
be strongly magnetic; very few weakly magnetic Ap stars with very long periods
have been identified and studied. We performed a systematic search based on
TESS data to identify super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars independently of
the strengths of their magnetic fields, with the intention to characterise the
distribution of the longest Ap star rotation periods in an unbiased manner. We
find 67 Ap stars with no rotational variability in the northern ecliptic
hemisphere TESS data. Among them, 46 are newly identified ssrAp star
candidates, which is double the number previously found in the southern
ecliptic hemisphere.
  We confirm that super-slow rotation tends to occur less frequently in weakly
magnetic Ap stars than in strongly magnetic stars. We present new evidence of
the existence of a gap between ~2 kG and ~3 kG in the distribution of the
magnetic field strengths of long period Ap stars. We also confirm that the
incidence of roAp stars is higher than average in slowly rotating Ap stars. We
report the unexpected discovery of nine definite and five candidate {\delta}
Sct stars, and of two eclipsing binaries. This work paves the way for a
systematic, unbiased study of the longest period Ap stars, with a view to

to InfoNCE loss based on previous positive and negative samples, which will
make the intra-class samples more compact and the inter-class samples more
dispersed. At the same time, using the potential structure information of
subspace samples to dynamically construct positive and negative samples can
make our framework more robust to noisy data. Furthermore, CL-FEFA considers
the mutual information between positive samples, that is, similar samples in

attractive subject from both fundamental and applied viewpoints. The distinct
growth behaviors between edge and basal plane of ice are one of the central
topics in ice growth. And the unidirectional freezing pattern stems from
perturbations of both basal and edge planes. To date there is no direct
comparison of unidirectional freezing behavior between basal and edge plane
ice. Here, we in-situ investigate the planar instability as well as the
unidirectional freezing pattern of basal and edge planes of ice by a design of
parallel freezing samples with specified ice orientations in a NaCl solution as
a modeled sea water. The planar instability is discussed via neutral stability
curves with surface tension anisotropy for both basal and edge plane ice. For
the first time, we realize the simultaneous observation of solid/liquid
interfaces of basal and edge plane ice under the same set of freezing

plane ice than basal plane ice. The time-lapse observations confirm a transient
competitive interaction of perturbations between the basal and edge planes ice,
which is explained by the anisotropic growth of perturbations in basal and edge
planes of ice. These experimental results provide a link between morphology

a nicely behaving evaluation map from $X^{\ast}\otimes X$ to the unit object

filling some gaps in literature along the way. Finally, we show that braided
pre-rigid monoidal categories indeed provide an appropriate setting for
liftability in the sense of loc. cit. and we present an application, varying on

and challenging problems in data mining and machine learning. The performances
of traditional classifiers will be severely affected by many data problems,
such as class imbalanced problem, class overlap and noise. The Tomek-Link
algorithm was only used to clean data when it was proposed. In recent years,
there have been reports of combining Tomek-Link algorithm with sampling
technique. The Tomek-Link sampling algorithm can effectively reduce the class
overlap on data, remove the majority instances that are difficult to
distinguish, and improve the algorithm classification accuracy. However, the
Tomek-Links under-sampling algorithm only considers the boundary instances that
are the nearest neighbors to each other globally and ignores the potential
local overlapping instances. When the number of minority instances is small,
the under-sampling effect is not satisfactory, and the performance improvement
of the classification model is not obvious. Therefore, on the basis of
Tomek-Link, a multi-granularity relabeled under-sampling algorithm (MGRU) is
proposed. This algorithm fully considers the local information of the data set
in the local granularity subspace, and detects the local potential overlapping
instances in the data set. Then, the overlapped majority instances are
eliminated according to the global relabeled index value, which effectively
expands the detection range of Tomek-Links. The simulation results show that
when we select the optimal global relabeled index value for under-sampling, the
classification accuracy and generalization performance of the proposed
under-sampling algorithm are significantly better than other baseline
algorithms.

research to solve various challenging problems. Here we explore one such
technique to address an important problem in quantum communication scenario.
While transferring quantum information through a noisy quantum channel, the
utility of the channel is characterized by its quantum capacity. Quantum
channels, however, display an intriguing property called super-additivity of
coherent information. This makes the calculation of quantum capacity a hard
computational problem involving optimization over an exponentially increasing
search space. In this work, we first utilize a neural network ansatz to
represent quantum states and then apply an evolutionary optimization scheme to
address this problem. We find regions in the three-parameter space of qubit
Pauli channels where coherent information exhibits this super-additivity
feature. We characterised the quantum codes that achieves high coherent
information, finding several non-trivial quantum codes that outperforms the
repetition codes for some Pauli channels. For some Pauli channels, these codes
displays very high super-additivity of the order of 0.01, much higher than the
observed values in other well studied quantum channels. We further compared the
learning performance of the Neural Network ansatz with the raw ansatz to find
that in the three-shot case, the neural network ansatz outperforms the raw
representation in finding quantum codes of high coherent information. We also
compared the learning performance of the evolutionary algorithm with a simple
Particle Swarm Optimisation scheme and show empirical results indicating
comparable performance, suggesting that the Neural Network ansatz coupled with
the evolutionary scheme is indeed a promising approach to finding non-trivial
quantum codes of high coherent information.

In this work, we investigate the efficacy of co-attention transformer layers in
helping the network focus on relevant regions while answering the question. We
generate visual attention maps using the question-conditioned image attention
scores in these co-attention layers. We evaluate the effect of the following
critical components on visual attention of a state-of-the-art VQA model: (i)
number of object region proposals, (ii) question part of speech (POS) tags,
(iii) question semantics, (iv) number of co-attention layers, and (v) answer
accuracy. We compare the neural network attention maps against human attention
maps both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings indicate that
co-attention transformer modules are crucial in attending to relevant regions
of the image given a question. Importantly, we observe that the semantic
meaning of the question is not what drives visual attention, but specific
keywords in the question do. Our work sheds light on the function and
interpretation of co-attention transformer layers, highlights gaps in current

challenging charge scheduling problem. Specifically, time-ineffective
recharging operations limit the profitability of charging during service

Here, high investment cost and grid capacity limit available charging
infrastructure such that operators need to schedule charging operations to keep
the fleet operational. In this context, flexible service operations, i.e.
allowing to delay or expedite vehicle departures, can potentially increase
charger utilization. Beyond this, jointly scheduling charging and service
operations promises operational cost savings through better utilization of
Time-of-Use energy tariffs and carefully crafted charging schedules designed to
minimize battery wear. Against this background, we study the resulting joint

to describe admissible search directions and, in particular, to formulate
optimality conditions. They notably appear in various recent algorithms for
both smooth and nonsmooth low-rank optimization where the feasible set is the
set $\mathbb{R}_{\leq r}^{m \times n}$ of all $m \times n$ real matrices of

the correspondence that maps each $X \in \mathbb{R}_{\leq r}^{m \times n}$ to
the tangent cone to $\mathbb{R}_{\leq r}^{m \times n}$ at $X$. We also deduce
results about the continuity of the corresponding normal cone correspondence.
Finally, we show that our results include as a particular case the
$a$-regularity of the Whitney stratification of $\mathbb{R}_{\leq r}^{m \times

the real determinantal variety.

second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array, a global
collaboration synthesizing decadal-length pulsar-timing campaigns in North
America, Europe, and Australia. In our reference search for a power law strain
spectrum of the form $h_c = A(f/1\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1})^{\alpha}$, we found strong
evidence for a spectrally-similar low-frequency stochastic process of amplitude
$A = 3.8^{+6.3}_{-2.5}\times10^{-15}$ and spectral index $\alpha = -0.5 \pm
0.5$, where the uncertainties represent 95\% credible regions, using
information from the auto- and cross-correlation terms between the pulsars in
the array. For a spectral index of $\alpha = -2/3$, as expected from a
population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries, the recovered
amplitude is $A = 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.8}\times10^{-15}$. Nonetheless, no significant
evidence of the Hellings-Downs correlations that would indicate a
gravitational-wave origin was found. We also analyzed the constituent data from
the individual pulsar timing arrays in a consistent way, and clearly
demonstrate that the combined international data set is more sensitive.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that this combined data set produces comparable
constraints to recent single-array data sets which have more data than the
constituent parts of the combination. Future international data releases will
deliver increased sensitivity to gravitational wave radiation, and
significantly increase the detection probability.

development of Node.js software, but also bring new security threats that
vulnerabilities could be introduced through dependencies. In particular, the
threats could be excessively amplified by transitive dependencies. Existing
research either considers direct dependencies or reasoning transitive
dependencies based on reachability analysis, which neglects the NPM-specific
dependency resolution rules, resulting in wrongly resolved dependencies.
Consequently, further fine-grained analysis, such as vulnerability propagation
and their evolution in dependencies, cannot be carried out precisely at a large
scale, as well as deriving ecosystem-wide solutions for vulnerabilities in
dependencies. To fill this gap, we propose a knowledge graph-based dependency
resolution, which resolves the dependency relations of dependencies as trees
(i.e., dependency trees), and investigates the security threats from
vulnerabilities in dependency trees at a large scale. We first construct a
complete dependency-vulnerability knowledge graph (DVGraph) that captures the
whole NPM ecosystem (over 10 million library versions and 60 million
well-resolved dependency relations). Based on it, we propose DTResolver to
statically and precisely resolve dependency trees, as well as transitive
vulnerability propagation paths, by considering the official dependency
resolution rules. Based on that, we carry out an ecosystem-wide empirical study
on vulnerability propagation and its evolution in dependency trees. Our study
unveils lots of useful findings, and we further discuss the lessons learned and
solutions for different stakeholders to mitigate the vulnerability impact in
NPM. For example, we implement a dependency tree based vulnerability
remediation method (DTReme) for NPM packages, and receive much better
performance than the official tool (npm audit fix).

exactly one customer and one server arrive. The incoming customer (resp.

the effect of self-gravity. The rate of this process was recently found to be
directly linked to the initial amount of velocity anisotropy: tangentially
anisotropic clusters contract faster than radially anisotropic ones.
Furthermore, initially anisotropic clusters are found to generically tend
towards more isotropic distributions during the onset of contraction.
Chandrasekhar's ""non-resonant"" (NR) theory of diffusion describes this
relaxation as being driven by a sequence of local two-body deflections along
each star's orbit. We explicitly tailor this NR prediction to anisotropic
clusters, and compare it with $N$-body realisations of Plummer spheres with
varying degrees of anisotropy. The NR theory is shown to recover remarkably
well the detailed shape of the orbital diffusion and the associated initial
isotropisation, up to a global multiplicative prefactor which increases with
anisotropy. Strikingly, a simple effective isotropic prescription provides
almost as good a fit, as long as the cluster's anisotropy is not too strong.
For these more extreme clusters, accounting for long-range resonant relaxation
may be necessary to capture these clusters' long-term evolution.

calculations of a newly developed CRbeam code. We find that model predictions
of different codes differ by up to 50% for low-redshift sources, with
discrepancies increasing up to order-of-magnitude level with the increasing
source redshifts. We identify the origin of these discrepancies and demonstrate
that after eliminating the inaccuracies found, the discrepancies between the
three codes are reduced to 10% when modeling nearby sources with z~0.1. We
argue that the new CRbeam code provides reliable predictions for spectral,
timing and imaging properties of the secondary gamma-ray signal for both nearby
and distant sources with z~1. Thus, it can be used to study gamma-ray sources
and IGMF with a level of precision that is appropriate for the prospective CTA
study of the effects of gamma-ray propagation through the intergalactic medium.

ensemble and so it is affected by systematic uncertainties due to the missing

reasonable agreement with the experimental data and with the next to leading

applied to any pseudoscalar meson, though for heavier mesons the possibility of
internal lighter states becomes problematic and still needs a proper study. A

a continuum that rises strongly to longer wavelengths, and is considerably
brighter than the most recent published spectrum obtained seven years earlier.
At the longer wavelengths the continuum is well fitted by a blackbody with a
temperature of $624\pm8$ K. However, there is excess continuum at the shortest
wavelengths that we interpret as being due to hot dust that has very recently
formed in an environment with C/O $\simeq2.5$. Other possible sources for this
excess continuum are discussed - such as the stellar photosphere dimly seen
through the dust shell, and light scattered off the inner wall of the dust
torus - but these interpretations seem unlikely. Numerous emission lines are
present, including those of HeI, CI, [CI], and OI. Our observations confirm
that emission in the HeI 1.083$\,\mu$m and [CI] 0.9827/0.9852$\,\mu$m lines is
spatially extended. The [CI] line fluxes suggest that the electron density
increased by an order of magnitude between 2013 and 2020, and that these two

construct a chance-constrained buffered uncertainty-aware Voronoi cell (B-UAVC)

an urban systems. Gravity models can be employed to quantitatively describe and
predict spatial flows. However, how to model passenger flows and reveal the
deep structure of urban and traffic networks in the case of missing partial
data is still a problem to be solved. This paper is devoted to characterizing
the interurban passenger flows in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China by
means of dual gravity models and Tencent location big data. The method of
parameter estimation is the least squares regression. The main results are as
follows. First, both railway and highway passenger flows can be effectively
described by the dual gravity model. A small part of missing spatial data can
be made up by the predicted values. Second, the fractal properties of traffic
flows can be revealed. The railway passenger flows more follow gravity scaling
law than the highway passenger flows. Third, the prediction residuals indicate
the changing trend of interurban connections in the study area in recent years.
The center of gravity of spatial dynamics seems to shift from the
Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan triangle to the Beijing-Baoding-Shijiazhuang axis. A
conclusion can be reached that the dual gravity models is an effective tools of
for analyzing spatial structures and dynamics of traffic networks and flows.
Moreover, the models provide a new approach to estimate fractal dimension of

need to be analyzed by a cardiologist, taking time which could be spent on
improving patient care and outcomes. Because of this, automatic ECG
classification systems using machine learning have been proposed, which can
learn complex interactions between ECG features and use this to detect
abnormalities. However, algorithms built for this purpose often fail to
generalize well to unseen data, reporting initially impressive results which
drop dramatically when applied to new environments. Additionally, machine
learning algorithms suffer a ""black-box"" issue, in which it is difficult to
determine how a decision has been made. This is vital for applications in
healthcare, as clinicians need to be able to verify the process of evaluation
in order to trust the algorithm. This paper proposes a method for visualizing

state-of-the-art models. This paper highlights how these maps can be used to
find problems in the model which could be affecting generalizability and model
performance. Comparing saliency maps across complete classes gives an overall
impression of confounding variables or other biases in the model, unlike what
would be highlighted when comparing saliency maps on an ECG-by-ECG basis.

an induced phenomenon, which has a multiple-scale structure. At astronomical
scales, as the distance from a gravitating center increases, gravitational
potential and corresponding spacetime metric are dominated by a Newtonian
(Schwarzschild) term, followed by a logarithmic term, finally by linear and
quadratic (de Sitter) terms. Correspondingly, rotation curves are predicted to
be Keplerian in the inner regions of galaxies, mostly flat in the outer
regions, and non-flat in the utmost outer regions. We compare theory's
predictions with the furthest rotation curves data points available for a
number of galaxies: using a two-parameter fit, we perform a preliminary
estimate which disregards the combined effect of gas and stellar disc, but is
relatively simple and uses minimal assumptions for galactic luminous matter.
The data strongly points out at the existence of a crossover transition from

successful prediction of seizures could significantly help patients suffering
from refractory epilepsy. For two dogs with yearlong intracranial
electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings, we studied the influence of time
series nonstationarity on the performance of seizure prediction using in-house
developed machine learning algorithms. We observed a long-term evolution on the
scale of weeks or months in iEEG time series that may be represented as
switching between certain meta-states. To better predict impending seizures,
retraining of prediction algorithms is therefore necessary and the retraining
schedule should be adjusted to the change in meta-states. There is evidence
that the nature of seizure-free interictal clips also changes with the
transition between meta-states, accwhich has been shown relevant for seizure
prediction.

of H&N primary Gross Tumor Volume (GTVt) in FDG-PET/CT images. Task 2 is the
automatic prediction of Progression Free Survival (PFS) from the same
FDG-PET/CT. Finally, Task 3 is the same as Task 2 with ground truth GTVt
annotations provided to the participants. The data were collected from six
centers for a total of 325 images, split into 224 training and 101 testing
cases. The interest in the challenge was highlighted by the important
participation with 103 registered teams and 448 result submissions. The best
methods obtained a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.7591 in the first
task, and a Concordance index (C-index) of 0.7196 and 0.6978 in Tasks 2 and 3,
respectively. In all tasks, simplicity of the approach was found to be key to
ensure generalization performance. The comparison of the PFS prediction
performance in Tasks 2 and 3 suggests that providing the GTVt contour was not
crucial to achieve best results, which indicates that fully automatic methods
can be used. This potentially obviates the need for GTVt contouring, opening
avenues for reproducible and large scale radiomics studies including thousands
potential subjects.

back along its original channel provide unprecedented opportunities for light
manipulation in wireless communication. However, to the best of our knowledge,
the existing methods of designing retroreflectors suffer from either the bulky
size, narrow angular bandwidth, or time-consuming post-processing. Here, a
scheme of designing ultrathin and all-angle retroreflectors based on hyperbolic
plasmonic metasurfaces is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The
physical mechanism underlying this scheme is the high-efficiency all-angle
transition between the traveling waves in free space and the canalized spoof
surface plasmon (SSP) on the hyperbolic plasmonic metasurfaces (HPMs). In this
case, the strong confinement characteristic benefited from the enhanced
light-matter interaction enables us to route and retroreflect the canalized SSP
with extremely ultrathin structures. As proof of the scheme, a retroreflector
prototype with a thickness approximately equal to the central wavelength is
designed and fabricated. Further experimental investigation obtains a maximum
efficiency of 83.2% and a half-power field of view up to 53{\deg}. This scheme
can find promising applications in target detection, remote sensing, and
diverse on-chip light control devices.

shear banding flow formation in a Taylor-Couette flow. Three sets of wormlike
micellar solutions, each set with a similar fluid elasticity and
zero-shear-rate viscosity, but with varying entanglement densities, are studied
under start-up of steady shear. Our experiments indicate that in the set with
the low fluid elasticity, the transient shear banding flow is characterized by
the formation of a transient flow reversal in a range of entanglement
densities. Outside of this range, the transient flow reversal is not observed.
For the sets of medium and high elasticities, the transient flow reversals
exist for relatively small entanglement densities, and disappear for large
entanglement densities. Our analysis shows that wall slip and elastic
instabilities do not affect the transient flow feature. We identify a
correlation between micellar entanglement number, the width of the stress
plateau, and the extent of the transient flow reversal. As the micellar
entanglement number increases, the width of the stress plateau first increases,
then, at a higher micellar entanglement number, plateau width decreases.
Therefore, we hypothesize that the transient flow reversal is connected to the
micellar entanglement number through the width of the stress plateau.

clustering research has attracted broad attention in recent years, yielding a
newly developed clustering paradigm, viz. the deep clustering (DC). Typically,
the DC models capitalize on autoencoders to learn the intrinsic features which
facilitate the clustering process in consequence. Nowadays, a generative model
named variational autoencoder (VAE) has got wide acceptance in DC studies.
Nevertheless, the plain VAE is insufficient to perceive the comprehensive
latent features, leading to the deteriorative clustering performance. In this
paper, a novel DC method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, the
generative adversarial network and VAE are coalesced into a new autoencoder
called fusion autoencoder (FAE) for discerning more discriminative
representation that benefits the downstream clustering task. Besides, the FAE
is implemented with the deep residual network architecture which further
enhances the representation learning ability. Finally, the latent space of the
FAE is transformed to an embedding space shaped by a deep dense neural network
for pulling away different clusters from each other and collapsing data points
within individual clusters. Experiment conducted on several image datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DC model against the baseline
methods.

and stored. This requires the deployment and maintenance of traffic sensing
infrastructure, often leading to unaffordable monetary costs. The lack of
sensed locations can be complemented with synthetic data simulations that
further lower the economical investment needed for traffic monitoring. One of
the most common data generative approaches consists of producing real-like
traffic patterns, according to data distributions from analogous roads. The
process of detecting roads with similar traffic is the key point of these
systems. However, without collecting data at the target location no flow
metrics can be employed for this similarity-based search. We present a method
to discover locations among those with available traffic data by inspecting
topological features. These features are extracted from domain-specific
knowledge as numerical representations (embeddings) to compare different
locations and eventually find roads with analogous daily traffic profiles based
on the similarity between embeddings. The performance of this novel selection
system is examined and compared to simpler traffic estimation approaches. After
finding a similar source of data, a generative method is used to synthesize
traffic profiles. Depending on the resemblance of the traffic behavior at the
sensed road, the generation method can be fed with data from one road only.
Several generation approaches are analyzed in terms of the precision of the
synthesized samples. Above all, this work intends to stimulate further research
efforts towards enhancing the quality of synthetic traffic samples and thereby,
reducing the need for sensing infrastructure.

cold fermionic atomic gases and used to determine the evolution (over either
time or temperature) of the Quantum Correlation Functions (QCF) that specify:
(a) the positions of the spin up and spin down fermionic atoms in a single
Cooper pair and (b) the positions of the two spin up and two spin down
fermionic atoms in two Cooper pairs The first of these QCF is relevant to
describing the change in size of a Cooper pair, as the fermion-fermion coupling
constant is changed via Feshbach resonance methods through the crossover from a
small Cooper pair on the BEC side to a large Cooper pair on the BCS side. The
second of these QCF is important for describing the correlations between the
positions of the fermionic atoms in two Cooper pairs, which is expected to be
small at the BEC or BCS sides of the crossover, but is expected to be
significant in the strong interaction unitary regime, where the size of a
Cooper pair is comparable to the separation between Cooper pairs. In GPST the
QCF are ultimately given via the stochastic average of products of Grassmann
stochastic momentum fields, and GPST shows that the stochastic average of the
products of Grassmann stochastic momentum fields at a later time (or lower
temperature) is related linearly to the stochastic average of the products of
Grassmann stochastic momentum fields at an earlier time (or higher
temperature), and that the matrix elements involved in the linear relations are
all c-numbers. Expressions for these matrix elements corresponding to a small
time or temperature increment have been obtained analytically, providing the
formulae needed for numerical studies of the evolution that are planned for a
future publication. Various initial conditions are considered, including those
for a non-interacting fermionic gas at zero temperature and a high temperature
gas.

surprising that children and college students are not the only ones using
online education. Millions of adults have signed up for online classes and
courses during last years, and MOOC providers, such as Coursera or edX, are
reporting millions of new users signing up in their platforms. However,
students do face some challenges when choosing courses. Though online review
systems are standard among many verticals, no standardized or fully
decentralized review systems exist in the MOOC ecosystem. In this vein, we
believe that there is an opportunity to leverage available open MOOC reviews in
order to build simpler and more transparent reviewing systems, allowing users
to really identify the best courses out there. Specifically, in our research we
analyze 2.4 million reviews (which is the largest MOOC reviews dataset used
until now) from five different platforms in order to determine the following:
(1) if the numeric ratings provide discriminant information to learners, (2) if
NLP-driven sentiment analysis on textual reviews could provide valuable
information to learners, (3) if we can leverage NLP-driven topic finding
techniques to infer themes that could be important for learners, and (4) if we
can use these models to effectively characterize MOOCs based on the open
reviews. Results show that numeric ratings are clearly biased (63\% of them are
5-star ratings), and the topic modeling reveals some interesting topics related
with course advertisements, the real applicability, or the difficulty of the
different courses. We expect our study to shed some light on the area and
promote a more transparent approach in online education reviews, which are
becoming more and more popular as we enter the post-pandemic era.

computer (QC) using Probabilistic Quantum Memory (PQM) and its extension,
Parameteric PQM (P-PQM) by calculating the Hamming distance between an input
pattern and a database of $r$ patterns containing $z$ features with $a$
distinct attributes.
  For accurate computations, the feature must be encoded using one-hot
encoding, which is memory-intensive for multi-attribute datasets with $a>2$. We
can easily represent multi-attribute data more compactly on a classical
computer by replacing one-hot encoding with label encoding. However, replacing
these encoding schemes on a QC is not straightforward as PQM and P-PQM operate
at the quantum bit level.
  We present an enhanced P-PQM, called EP-PQM, that allows label encoding of
data stored in a PQM data structure and reduces the circuit depth of the data
storage and retrieval procedures. We show implementations for an ideal QC and a
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device.
  Our complexity analysis shows that the EP-PQM approach requires $O\left(z
\log_2(a)\right)$ qubits as opposed to $O(za)$ qubits for P-PQM. EP-PQM also
requires fewer gates, reducing gate count from $O\left(rza\right)$ to
$O\left(rz\log_2(a)\right)$.
  For five datasets, we demonstrate that training an ML classification model
using EP-PQM requires 48% to 77% fewer qubits than P-PQM for datasets with
$a>2$. EP-PQM reduces circuit depth in the range of 60% to 96%, depending on
the dataset. The depth decreases further with a decomposed circuit, ranging
between 94% and 99%.
  EP-PQM requires less space; thus, it can train on and classify larger
datasets than previous PQM implementations on NISQ devices. Furthermore,
reducing the number of gates speeds up the classification and reduces the noise
associated with deep quantum circuits. Thus, EP-PQM brings us closer to
scalable ML on a NISQ device.

Discovering reparameterizations to transform such complex original equations
into normal-form is often very difficult, and the reparameterization may not
even exist in a closed-form. Recent advancements have tied both information
geometry and bifurcations to the Renormalization Group. Here, we show that
sloppy model analysis (a method of information geometry) can be used directly
on bifurcations of increasing time scales to rapidly characterize the system's
topological inhomogeneities, whether the system is in normal form or not. We
anticipate that this novel analytical method, which we call time-widening

layers at the top for command classification. Compared with a traditional
end-to-end CNN baseline for SCR, our proposed CNN+(TT-DNN) model replaces fully

of model parameters while maintaining the baseline performance of the CNN
model. We initialize the CNN+(TT-DNN) model in a randomized manner or based on
a well-trained CNN+DNN, and assess the CNN+(TT-DNN) models on the Google Speech

over the past decades. Despite this progress, there are still many obstacles to
fully understanding how radiation interacts with biologically relevant cellular
components to form observable endpoints. One hurdle is the difficulty faced by
members of different research groups in directly comparing results. Multiple
Monte Carlo codes have been developed to simulate damage induction at the DNA
scale, while at the same time various groups have developed models that
describe DNA repair processes with varying levels of detail. These repair
models are intrinsically linked to the damage model employed in their
development, making it difficult to disentangle systematic effects in either
part of the modelling chain. The modelling chain typically consists of track
structure Monte Carlo simulations of the physics interactions creating direct
damages to the DNA; followed by simulations of the production and initial
reactions of chemical species causing indirect damages. After the DNA damage
induction, DNA repair models combine the simulated damage patterns with
biological models to determine the biological consequences of the damage. We
propose a new Standard data format for DNA Damage to unify the interface
between the simulation of damage induction and the biological modelling of cell
repair processes. Such a standard greatly facilitates inter model comparisons,
providing an ideal environment to tease out model assumptions and identify
persistent, underlying mechanisms. Through inter model comparisons, this
unified standard has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the
underlying mechanisms of radiation induced DNA damage and the resulting
observable biological effects.

can be beneficial for the following reasons: Firstly, we sampled randomly and
only input spatial coordinates without being restricted by the nature of

the traditional methods. Finally, our method is parallel and can solve multiple

a fundamental perspective. It turns out that although representing a couple by
its moment vector is very useful in rigid body mechanics and strength of
materials, it has been very misleading in continuum mechanics. To specify the
effect of a concentrated couple in continuum mechanics, not only the couple
moment, but also the line of action of its constituent parallel opposite forces
must be specified. However, in the governing equations of equilibrium or motion
of a continuum, only moment of body couple, moment of couple-tractions, and
moment of couple-stresses appear without specifying the line of action of any
couple density forces. This results in non-uniqueness of the state of stresses
and deformation in the continuum, which has shown itself in the indeterminacy
of the couple-stress tensor. Nevertheless, the physical state of stress and
deformation in the continuum is unique and determinate. Therefore, this imposes
some restrictions on the form of body couple, couple-traction and
couple-stresses. Here, the uniqueness of interactions in the continuum is used
to establish that the continuum does not support a distribution of body couple,
and a distribution of surface twisting couple-traction with normal moment. From
this the mechanism of action of the couple-traction as a double layer of shear
force-tractions, and the skew-symmetric character of the couple-stress moment
tensor in continuum mechanics are also established.
