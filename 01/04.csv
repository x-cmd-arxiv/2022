resources for the neuroscience community, but users often have a hard time
orienting themselves in the service landscape to find the best fit for their
particular needs. INCF (International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility)
has developed a set of recommendations and associated criteria for choosing or
setting up and running a repository or scientific gateway, intended for the
neuroscience community, with a FAIR neuroscience perspective. These
recommendations have neurosciences as their primary use case but are often
general. Considering the perspectives of researchers and providers of
repositories as well as scientific gateways, the recommendations harmonize and
complement existing work on criteria for repositories and best practices. The
recommendations cover a range of important areas including accessibility,
licensing, community responsibility and technical and financial sustainability
of a service.

physically-separated qubit nodes. Each node comprises a microwave phonon
transducer, an externally-controlled superconducting variable coupler, and a
superconducting qubit. Using this system, precisely-shaped individual itinerant
phonons are used to coherently transfer quantum information between the two

We further explore the dispersive interactions between an itinerant phonon
emitted from one node and interacting with the superconducting qubit in the
remote node. The observed interactions between the phonon and the remote qubit
promise future quantum optics-style experiments with itinerant phonons.

OT successful in ML applications, making it robust to data normalization and

be significantly slower for UOT than for OT. In this work, we identify the
cause for this deficiency, namely the lack of a global normalization of the
iterates, which equivalently corresponds to a translation of the dual OT
potentials. Our first contribution leverages this idea to develop a provably
accelerated Sinkhorn algorithm (coined 'translation invariant Sinkhorn') for
UOT, bridging the computational gap with OT. Our second contribution focusses
on 1-D UOT and proposes a Frank-Wolfe solver applied to this translation
invariant formulation. The linear oracle of each steps amounts to solving a 1-D

resonance imaging (fMRI) time-series that introduces spurious signal
fluctuations in proximity to blood vessels. fMRI alone is not sufficiently fast
to resolve cardiac pulsation. Depending on the ratio between the instantaneous
heart-rate and the acquisition sampling frequency (1/TR, with TR being the
repetition time), the cardiac signal may alias into the frequency band of
neural activation. The introduction of simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging
has significantly reduced the chances of cardiac aliasing. However, the
necessity of covering the entire brain at high spatial resolution restrain the
shortest TR to just over 0.5 seconds, which is in turn not sufficiently short
to resolve cardiac pulsation beyond 60 beats per minute. Recently,
hyper-sampling of the fMRI time-series has been introduced to overcome this
issue. While each anatomical location is sampled every TR seconds, the time
between consecutive excitations is shorter and thus adequate to resolve cardiac
pulsation. In this study, we show that it is feasible to temporally and
spatially resolve cardiac waveforms at each voxel location by combining a
dedicated hyper-sampling decomposition scheme with SMS. We developed the
technique on 774 healthy subjects selected from the Human Connectome Project
(HCP) and validated the technology against the RETROICOR method. The proposed
approach, which we name Data-driven WHOle-brain CArdiac signal REgression from

fully data-driven, does not make specific assumptions on cardiac pulsatility,
and is independent from external physiological recordings so that the
retrospective correction of fMRI data becomes possible when such measurements

grocery stores, impeding residents ability to prepare for and cope with
hardships during the disaster and recovery; however, disrupted access to
critical facilities is not equal for all residents of a community. In this
study, we examine disparate access to grocery stores in the context of the 2017
Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas. We utilized high-resolution
location-based datasets in implementing spatial network analysis and dynamic
clustering techniques to uncover the overall disparate access to grocery stores
for socially vulnerable populations during different phases of the disaster.
Three access indicators are examined using network-centric measures: number of
unique stores visited, average trip time to stores, and average distance to
stores. These access indicators help us capture three dimensions of access:
redundancy, rapidity, and proximity. The findings show the insufficiency of
focusing merely on the distributional factors, such as location in a food
desert and number of facilities, to capture the disparities in access,
especially during the preparation and impact/short-term recovery periods.
Furthermore, the characterization of access by considering combinations of
access indicators reveals that flooding disproportionally affects socially
vulnerable populations. High-income areas have better access during preparation

equilibria. Before an instance of the game starts, an external observer does
not know, a priori, what is the exact profile of actions that will occur; thus,
he assigns subjective probabilities to players' actions. However, not all
probabilistic assignments are coherent with a given game. We study the decision
problem of determining if a given set of probabilistic constraints assigned a
priori by the observer to a given game is coherent, which we call the Coherence
of Probabilistic Constraints on Equilibria, or PCE-Coherence. We show several
results concerning algorithms and complexity for PCE-Coherence when only pure
Nash equilibria are considered. In this context, we also study the computation
of maximal and minimal probabilistic constraints on actions that preserves
coherence. Finally, we study these problems when mixed Nash equilibria are
allowed.

controllable hardware qubits is insufficient to implement quantum error
correction (QEC). As an alternative, quantum error mitigation (QEM) can
suppress errors in measurement results via repeated experiments and
postprocessing of data. Typical techniques for error mitigation, e.g., the
quasi-probability decomposition method, ignore correlated errors between
different gates. Here, we introduce a QEM method based on the matrix product

times with only a small bond dimension $D^{\prime} = 1$ for the noise channel.
The MPO representation increases the accuracy of modeling noise without
consuming more experimental resources, which improves the QEM performance and
broadens its scope of application. Our method is hopeful of being applied to
circuits in higher dimensions with more qubits and deeper depth.

common node at a given time point, may be an important determinant of epidemic
processes in temporal networks. We propose theoretically tractable Markovian
temporal network models in which each edge flips between the active and
inactive states in continuous time. The different models have different amounts
of concurrency while we can tune the models to share the same statistics of
edge activation and deactivation (and hence the fraction of time for which each
edge is active) and the structure of the aggregate (i.e., static) network. We
analytically calculate the amount of concurrency of edges sharing a node for
each model. We then numerically study effects of concurrency on epidemic
spreading in the stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) dynamics on
the proposed temporal network models. We find that the concurrency enhances
epidemic spreading near the epidemic threshold while this effect is small in
some cases. When the infection rate is substantially larger than the epidemic
threshold, the concurrency suppresses epidemic spreading. In sum, our numerical
simulations indicate that the impact of concurrency on epidemic spreading is
modest. The proposed temporal network models are expected to be useful for
investigating effects of concurrency on various collective dynamics on networks
including both infectious and other dynamics.

evaluate the lunar UERE across various case studies of the LNSS design to
demonstrate comparable performance as that of the legacy Earth-GPS, even while
using a low-SWaP onboard clock. We further perform sensitivity analysis to
investigate the variation in the lunar UERE metric across different case

Neural Network (NN) model on their private data without revealing the data.
Recently, several targeted poisoning attacks against FL have been introduced.
These attacks inject a backdoor into the resulting model that allows
adversary-controlled inputs to be misclassified. Existing countermeasures
against backdoor attacks are inefficient and often merely aim to exclude
deviating models from the aggregation. However, this approach also removes
benign models of clients with deviating data distributions, causing the
aggregated model to perform poorly for such clients.
  To address this problem, we propose DeepSight, a novel model filtering
approach for mitigating backdoor attacks. It is based on three novel techniques
that allow to characterize the distribution of data used to train model updates
and seek to measure fine-grained differences in the internal structure and
outputs of NNs. Using these techniques, DeepSight can identify suspicious model
updates. We also develop a scheme that can accurately cluster model updates.
Combining the results of both components, DeepSight is able to identify and
eliminate model clusters containing poisoned models with high attack impact. We
also show that the backdoor contributions of possibly undetected poisoned
models can be effectively mitigated with existing weight clipping-based
defenses. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of DeepSight and show
that it can mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with a negligible impact
on the model's performance on benign data.

Polypectomy can effectively interrupt the progression of adenoma to
adenocarcinoma, thus reducing the risk of CRC development. Colonoscopy is the
primary method to find colonic polyps. However, due to the different sizes of
polyps and the unclear boundary between polyps and their surrounding mucosa, it
is challenging to segment polyps accurately. To address this problem, we design
a Boundary Distribution Guided Network (BDG-Net) for accurate polyp
segmentation. Specifically, under the supervision of the ideal Boundary
Distribution Map (BDM), we use Boundary Distribution Generate Module (BDGM) to
aggregate high-level features and generate BDM. Then, BDM is sent to the
Boundary Distribution Guided Decoder (BDGD) as complementary spatial
information to guide the polyp segmentation. Moreover, a multi-scale feature
interaction strategy is adopted in BDGD to improve the segmentation accuracy of
polyps with different sizes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms state-of-the-art
models remarkably on five public polyp datasets while maintaining low
computational complexity. Code: https://github.com/zihuanqiu/BDG-Net

have led to great enhancements in state-of-the-art production systems for NLP
tasks, such as virtual assistants, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.
However, such NLP systems still often fail when tested with adversarial
attacks. The initial lack of robustness exposed troubling gaps in current
models' language understanding capabilities, creating problems when NLP systems
are deployed in real life. In this paper, we present a structured overview of
NLP robustness research by summarizing the literature in a systemic way across
various dimensions. We then take a deep-dive into the various dimensions of
robustness, across techniques, metrics, embeddings, and benchmarks. Finally, we
argue that robustness should be multi-dimensional, provide insights into
current research, identify gaps in the literature to suggest directions worth
pursuing to address these gaps.

for face images based on a Generative Adversarial Network that generates a
scalar quality measure related with the face recognition accuracy. FaceQgen
does not require labelled quality measures for training. It is trained from
scratch using the SCface database. FaceQgen applies image restoration to a face
image of unknown quality, transforming it into a canonical high quality image,
i.e., frontal pose, homogeneous background, etc. The quality estimation is
built as the similarity between the original and the restored images, since low
quality images experience bigger changes due to restoration. We compare three
different numerical quality measures: a) the MSE between the original and the
restored images, b) their SSIM, and c) the output score of the Discriminator of
the GAN. The results demonstrate that FaceQgen's quality measures are good
estimators of face recognition accuracy. Our experiments include a comparison
with other quality assessment methods designed for faces and for general
images, in order to position FaceQgen in the state of the art. This comparison
shows that, even though FaceQgen does not surpass the best existing face
quality assessment methods in terms of face recognition accuracy prediction, it
achieves good enough results to demonstrate the potential of semi-supervised
learning approaches for quality estimation (in particular, data-driven learning
based on a single high quality image per subject), having the capacity to
improve its performance in the future with adequate refinement of the model and
the significant advantage over competing methods of not needing quality labels
for its development. This makes FaceQgen flexible and scalable without
expensive data curation.

range of inner core and outer core radii to investigate the relative importance
of viscous dissipation at the CMB and ICB, and to show how this dissipation is
connected to the phase lead angle ($\phi_p$) of the mantle ahead of its Cassini

core nutation frequency $\Omega_{ficn}$ approaches $\Omega_p$, viscous
dissipation at the ICB can be comparable to that at the CMB, and in the most
extreme cases exceed it by as much as a factor 10. If so, the viscous
dissipation in the lunar core projected back in time depends on how
$\Omega_{ficn}$ has evolved relative to $\Omega_p$. We further show that
constraints on the CMB and ICB radii of the lunar core can in principle be
extracted by matching the observed phase lead of $\phi_p=0.27$ arcsec; this

fundamental process during star formation. Measuring the mass accretion rate is
particularly challenging for stars belonging to binary systems, because it is
often difficult to discriminate which component is accreting. DQ~Tau is an
almost equal-mass spectroscopic binary system where the components orbit each
other every 15.8~days. The system is known to display pulsed accretion, i.e.,
the periodic modulation of the accretion by the components on eccentric orbit.
We present multiepoch ESO/VLT X-Shooter observations of DQ~Tau, with the aim to
determine which component of this system is the main accreting source. We use
the absorption lines in the spectra to determine the radial velocity of the two
components, and measure the continuum veiling as a function of wavelength and
time. We fit the observed spectra with non-accreting templates to correct for
the photospheric and chromospheric contribution. In the corrected spectra we
study in details the profiles of the emission lines and calculate mass
accretion rates for the system as a function of orbital phase. In accordance
with previous findings, we detect elevated accretion close to periastron. We
measure that the accretion rate varies between $10^{-8.5}$ and $10^{-7.3}$
Msun/yr. The emission line profiles suggest that both stars are actively
accreting and the dominant accretor is not always the same component, varying
in few orbits.

autoencoder-based self-supervised 3D representation learning. The most popular
and accessible 3D representation, i.e., point clouds, involves discrete samples
of the underlying continuous 3D surface. This discretization process introduces
sampling variations on the 3D shape, making it challenging to develop
transferable knowledge of the true 3D geometry. In the standard autoencoding
paradigm, the encoder is compelled to encode not only the 3D geometry but also
information on the specific discrete sampling of the 3D shape into the latent
code. This is because the point cloud reconstructed by the decoder is
considered unacceptable unless there is a perfect mapping between the original
and the reconstructed point clouds. This paper introduces the Implicit
AutoEncoder (IAE), a simple yet effective method that addresses the sampling
variation issue by replacing the commonly-used point-cloud decoder with an
implicit decoder. The implicit decoder reconstructs a continuous representation
of the 3D shape, independent of the imperfections in the discrete samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed IAE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised learning
benchmarks.

monthly Q of the Moon and hence, that the contribution from solid-body tides to
$\phi_p$ is largely unaffected by an inner core. However, we also show that
viscoelastic deformation within the inner core, acting to realign its figure
axis with that of the mantle, can contribute significantly to $\phi_p$ through
inner core-mantle gravitational coupling. We show that the contribution to
$\phi_p$ is largest when the inner core viscosity is in the range of $10^{13}$
to $10^{14}$ Pa s, when the inner core radius is large and when the free inner
core nutation frequency approaches a resonance with the precession frequency of
$2\pi/18.6$ yr$^{-1}$.

associated with the differential precession at the core-mantle boundary (CMB),
$Q_{cmb}$, and at the inner core boundary (ICB), $Q_{icb}$, as a function of
the evolving lunar orbit. We focus on the latter and show that, provided the
inner core was larger than 100 km, $Q_{icb}$ may have been as high as
$10^{10}-10^{11}$ W for most of the lunar history for a broad range of core
density models. This is larger than the power required to maintain the fluid
core in an adiabatic state, therefore the heat released by the differential
precession at the ICB can drive a past lunar dynamo by thermal convection. This
dynamo can outlive the dynamo from precession at the CMB and may have shutoff
only relatively recently. Estimates of the magnetic field strength at the lunar
surface are of the order of a few $\mu$T, compatible with the lunar
paleomagnetic intensities recorded after 3 Ga. We further show that it is
possible that a transition of the Cassini state associated with the inner core
may have occurred as a result of the evolution of the lunar orbit. The heat
flux associated with $Q_{icb}$ can be of the order of a few mW m$^{-2}$, which
should slow down inner core growth and be included in thermal evolution models

active reservoirs is a significant, yet virtually unexplored question. Here we
address this issue in the context of energy transport between two active
reservoirs connected by a chain of harmonic oscillators. The couplings to the
reservoirs, which exert correlated stochastic forces on the boundary
oscillators, lead to fascinating behavior of the energy current and kinetic
temperature profile, which we compute exactly in the thermodynamic limit. We
show that the stationary active current (i) changes non-monotonically as the
activity of the reservoirs are changed, leading to a negative differential
conductivity (NDC), and (ii) exhibits an unexpected direction reversal at some
finite value of the activity drive. For the example of a dichotomous active
force, we find the physical origin of the NDC using nonequilibrium response
formalism. It turns out that the kinetic temperature profile remains uniform at
the bulk, and can be expressed in a form similar to the thermally driven case.
We show that despite this apparent similarity, no effective thermal picture can
be consistently built in general. However, such a picture emerges in the small
activity limit, where many of the well-known results are recovered.

the ML energy model that, by successfully emulating the time-consuming
electronic structure calculation, can accurately predict a local energy based
on the classical field in the intermediate neighborhood. In order to properly
include the symmetry of the electron Hamiltonian, a crucial component of the ML
energy model is the descriptor that transforms the neighborhood configuration
into invariant feature variables, which are input to the learning model. A
general theory of the descriptor for the classical fields is formulated, and
two types of models are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of
an internal symmetry for the classical field. Several specific approaches to
the descriptor of the classical fields are presented. Our focus is on the
group-theoretical method that offers a systematic and rigorous approach to
compute invariants based on the bispectrum coefficients. We propose an

tailor the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method developed in the

that the ROA analysis can be approximated as a constrained maximization problem
whose goal is to find the worst-case initial condition which shifts the

can be used to solve the resultant constrained maximization problem. Our
analysis is not based on Lyapunov theory, and hence requires minimum

the PGD updates can be efficiently performed using back-propagation. In the
model-free setting (which is more relevant to ROA analysis of perception-based

requires a black-box simulator for generating the trajectories of the
closed-loop system given any initial state. We demonstrate the scalability and
generality of our analysis tool on several numerical examples with large-scale

frequency ($\omega_{ficn}$) and the precession frequency $\Omega_p = 2\pi/18.6$
yr $^{-1}$. All three Cassini states are possible if $|\omega_{ficn}| >
2\pi/16.4$ yr $^{-1}$, but only one is possible otherwise. Assuming that the
lowest energy state is favoured, this transition marks a discontinuity in the
tilt angle of the inner core, transiting from $-33^\circ$ to $17^\circ$ as
measured with respect to the mantle figure axis, where negative angles indicate
a tilt towards the orbit normal. Possible Lunar interior density structures
cover a range of $\omega_{ficn}$, from approximately half to twice as large as
$\Omega_p$, so the precise tilt angle of the inner core remains unknown, though
it is likely large because $\Omega_p$ is within the resonant band of
$\omega_{ficn}$. Adopting one specific density model, we suggest an inner core
tilt of approximately $-17^\circ$. Viscoelastic deformations within the inner
core and melt and growth at the surface of a tilted inner core, both neglected

approximately 200 km, it may contribute by as much as a few thousandths of a

This approach is based on two tensor-network techniques: Time Evolving Block

former is an efficient algorithm used to simulate the dynamics of 1D quantum
lattice systems, while the latter a finite-temperature algorithm for generating
a set of typical states representing the Gibbs canonical ensemble. As an
illustrative example, we apply this approach to the Ising chain in mixed
transverse and longitudinal fields. Under an arbitrary protocol, the moment
generating function of the work can be obtained, from which the work moments
are numerically calculated and the quantum Jarzynski equality can be tested.
Moreover, the numerical approach is also adapted to test the universal quantum

Renn. In his published paper of November 18, 1915, Einstein presented a
solution to the problem of the perihelion motion of Mercury and obtained the
correct result of 43 seconds of arc per century. Before 1915, Einstein had
established non-covariant field equations (the Entwurf field equations). But in
1915, he changed his mind and dropped these equations and was led to general
covariance. In a manuscript written in 1913, Einstein and his best friend
Michele Besso tried to solve the Entwurf field equations to attain the
perihelion advance of Mercury. The end result arrived at by Einstein was 1821
seconds of arc per century. To make a long story short, the field of a static
Sun produced an advance of the perihelion of Mercury of 18 seconds of arc per
century. Einstein kept quiet about this result and continued to work on the
Entwurf theory. Janssen and Renn ask: If we follow the prescriptions of Karl
Popper, why did Einstein not accept that his Entwurf theory had been falsified?
They further ask: Given the undeniable importance of Besso's earlier
calculations, why did Einstein not invite Besso as a co-author of his November
1915 paper on the perihelion motion of Mercury? Besso did not even get an
acknowledgment in Einstein's paper. After a brief review of Einstein's and
Besso's early attempts at calculating the advance of the perihelion of Mercury,
I discuss falsification and confirmation by previously known evidence and then
propose an answer to the above two questions.

helping, which allows the user to write code using fine-grained locks, but run
it in a lock-free manner.
  Although lock-free locks have been suggested in the past, they are widely
viewed as impractical, have some key limitations, and, as far as we know, have
never been implemented. The paper presents some key techniques that make
lock-free locks practical and more general. The most important technique is an
approach to idempotence -- i.e. making code that runs multiple times appear as
if it ran once. The idea is based on using a shared log among processes running
the same protected code. Importantly, the approach can be library based,
requiring very little if any change to standard code -- code just needs to use
the idempotent versions of memory operations (load, store, LL/SC, allocation,
free).
  We have implemented a C++ library called Flock based on the ideas. Flock
allows lock-based data structures to run in either lock-free or blocking
(traditional locks) mode. We implemented a variety of tree and list-based data
structures with Flock and compare the performance of the lock-free and blocking
modes under a variety of workloads. The lock-free mode is almost as fast as
blocking mode under almost all workloads, and significantly faster when threads
are oversubscribed (more threads than processors). We also compare with several
existing lock-based and lock-free alternatives.

imaging of embryos (in vivo) growth over time. However, cumulative exposure is
phototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet
fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well
suited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are
computationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this
challenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed
to achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial
direction (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also,
acquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is
computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive
sensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage. We
present the theory and experimentally validate the approach. To demonstrate our
technique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish

confocal microscope. From the results, we observe the CS-based approach
achieves accurate 3D volume reconstruction from less than 20% of the entire

presence of oceans and continents, hence placing direct constraints on the
current and long-term habitability of these worlds. Inferring the albedo map of
a planet from its observed light curve is challenging because different maps
may yield indistinguishable light curves. This degeneracy is aggravated by
changing clouds. It has previously been suggested that disk-integrated
photometry spanning multiple days could be combined to obtain a cloud-free
surface map of an exoplanet. We demonstrate this technique as part of a
Bayesian retrieval by simultaneously fitting for the fixed surface map of a
planet and the time-variable overlying clouds. We test this approach on
synthetic data then apply it to real disk-integrated observations of the Earth.
We find that eight days of continuous synthetic observations are sufficient to
reconstruct a faithful low resolution surface albedo map, without needing to
make assumptions about cloud physics. For lightcurves with negligible
photometric uncertainties, the minimal top-of-atmosphere albedo at a location
is a good estimate of its surface albedo. When applied to observations from the
Earth Polychromating Imaging Camera aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft, our approach
removes only a small fraction of clouds. We attribute this difficulty to the

through SED fitting and study the evolution of the SFR with redshift as well as
the effects of BCG stellar mass, cluster halo mass and cooling time on star
formation. Our BCGs have $SFR = 1.4\times10^{-3}-275.2$ [$\rm M_{\odot}$/yr]
and $sSFR=5 \times 10^{-15}-6 \times 10^{-10}$ [yr$^{-1}$] . We find that
star-forming BCGs are more abundant at higher redshifts and have higher $SFR$
than at lower redshifts. The fraction of star-forming BCGs ($f_{\rm SF}$)
varies from 30% to 80% at $0.05 < z < 0.42$. Despite the large values of
$f_{\rm SF}$, we show that only 13% of the BCGs lie on the star-forming main
sequence for field galaxies at the same redshifts. We also find that $f_{\rm
SF}$ depends only weakly on $\rm M_{200}$, while it sharply decreases with $\rm
M_{*}$. We finally find that the $SFR$ in BCGs decreases with increasing $\rm
t_{cool}$, suggesting that star formation is related to the cooling of the
intra-cluster medium. However, we also find a weak correlation of $\rm M_{*}$
and $\rm M_{200}$ with $\rm t_{cool}$, suggesting that AGN are heating the
intra-cluster gas around the BCGs. We compare our estimates of $SFR$ with the
predictions from empirical models for the evolution of the $SFR$ with redshift,
finding that the transition from a merger dominated to a cooling-dominated star
formation may happen at $z < 0.6$.

could have been delivered by carbon-rich meteorites, or produced in situ by
processes beginning with the synthesis of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in the early
Earth's atmosphere. Here, we construct a robust physical and non-equilibrium
chemical model of the early Earth atmosphere. The atmosphere is supplied with
hydrogen from impact degassing of meteorites, sourced with water evaporated
from the oceans, carbon dioxide from volcanoes, and methane from undersea
hydrothermal vents, and in which lightning and external UV-driven chemistry
produce HCN. This allows us to calculate the rain-out of HCN into warm little
ponds (WLPs). We then use a comprehensive sources and sinks numerical model to
compute the resulting abundances of nucleobases, ribose, and nucleotide
precursors such as 2-aminooxazole resulting from aqueous and UV-driven
chemistry within them. We find that at 4.4 bya (billion years ago) the limits
of adenine concentrations in ponds for habitable surfaces is 0.05$\mu$M in the
absence of seepage. These concentrations can be maintained for over 100 Myr.
Meteorite delivery of adenine to WLPs can provide boosts in concentration by
2-3 orders of magnitude, but these boosts deplete within months by UV
photodissociation, seepage, and hydrolysis. The early evolution of the
atmosphere is dominated by the decrease of hydrogen due to falling impact rates
and atmospheric escape, and the rise of oxygenated species such as OH from H2O
photolysis. Our work points to an early origin of RNA on Earth within ~200 Myr
of the Moon-forming impact.

Here, we mine the Gaia EDR3 catalogue for Galactic sources with significant

candidate X-ray binaries (XRBs). Cross-matching our sample with the Chandra
Source Catalogue returns a primary sample of ~6,500 X-ray sources with

a factor of ~4.5 times higher than in a matched control sample exhibiting low

as unified spin-isospin transitions, the M1/GT transition strengths and
excitation energies are subject to isospin symmetry. The excitation properties
associated to the M1/GT symmetry need to be clarified within consistent
theoretical approach. In this work, the relationship between the M1 and GT
transitions in Ca isotopes is investigated in a unified framework based on the
relativistic energy-density functional (REDF) with point-coupling interactions,
using the relativistic quasi-particle random-phase approximation (RQRPA). It is
shown that the isovector-pseudovector (IV-PV) residual interaction affects both
transitions, and the symmetry of M1 and giant-GT transitions is disrupted by
this interaction in closed-shell nuclei. In open-shell Ca isotopes, the
proton-neutron pairing in the residual RQRPA interaction also plays a role in
GT transitions. Due to the interplay between these interactions, the M1/GT
symmetry can be restored especially in the $^{42}$Ca nucleus, i.e., the
giant-GT strength can become comparable to that of the M1 mode in terms of the
unified spin-isospin transitions by adjusting the PN-pairing strength to
reproduce the experimental low-lying GT-excitation energies. The mirror
symmetry of both M1 and GT transitions is also demonstrated for open-shell
mirror partners, $^{42}$Ca and $^{42}$Ti. Further improvements are required to
achieve simultaneous reproduction of M1 and GT-transition energies in the REDF

Given a
model distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one
computes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using
the Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly
given by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.
However, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier
defined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative
models, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there
are situations in which dividing classifiers into ""generative"" and
""discriminative"" is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather
related to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.
We present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier
induced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way
from the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular
cases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and
two extensions of HMC, one of which being original. Finally, we shortly
illustrate the interest of the new discriminative way of computing classifiers

axis have been inferred to exist in Earth's fluid core on the basis of magnetic
field observations and changes in the length-of-day. These accelerations have a
typical timescale of decades. However, the physical mechanism causing the
accelerations is not well understood. Scaling arguments suggest that the
leading order torque averaged over cylindrical surfaces should arise from the
Lorentz force. Decadal fluctuations in the magnetic field inside the core,
driven by convective flows, could then force decadal changes in the Lorentz
torque and generate zonal accelerations. We test this hypothesis by
constructing a quasi-geostrophic model of magnetoconvection, with
thermally-driven flows perturbing a steady, imposed background magnetic field.
We show that when the Alfv\'{e}n number in our model is similar to that in
Earth's fluid core, temporal fluctuations in the torque balance are dominated
by the Lorentz torque, with the latter generating mean zonal accelerations. Our
model reproduces both fast, free Alfv\'{e}n waves and slow, forced
accelerations, with ratios of relative strength and relative timescale similar
to those inferred for the Earth's core. The temporal changes in the magnetic
field which drive the time-varying Lorentz torque are produced by the
underlying convective flows, shearing and advecting the magnetic field on a
timescale associated with convective eddies. Our results support the hypothesis
that temporal changes in the magnetic field deep inside Earth's fluid core
drive the observed decadal zonal accelerations of cylindrical surfaces through
the Lorentz torque.

is located in a different cluster. In the observations there are in total 88
other spiral galaxies within the field of view (40'x40') and observed bandwidth
(6500 km s$^{-1}$). We detect 13 of these 88 spirals, plus one uncatalogued
spiral, with HI masses ranging from 1 to 7 $\times$ 10${^9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Many
of these detections have extended HI disks, two show direct evidence for ram
pressure stripping, while others are possibly affected by tidal forces and/or
ram-pressure stripping. We stack the 75 non-detected spiral galaxies and find
an average HI mass of 1.9 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$, which given their
average stellar mass, implies they are very HI deficient. Comparing the extreme
jellyfish galaxies to the other disk galaxies, we find that they have a larger
stellar mass than almost all disk galaxies and than all HI detected galaxies,
they are at smaller projected distance from the cluster center and at higher
relative velocity to the cluster mean than all HI detections and most
non-detections. We conclude that the high stellar mass allows extreme jellyfish
galaxies to fall deeply into the cluster before being stripped and the
surrounding ICM pressure gives rise to their spectacular star-forming tails.

the larger electromagnetic drag force weakens the local core flows and deflects

forming planet's core reaching very high temperatures ($>$1000 K), which would
lead to it warming its surroundings. Here, we explore the effects of a luminous
planetary core on the solids that it ultimately accretes. We find that a
critical transition occurs where very hot (rapidly accreting) cores drive off
volatiles prior to accretion, while cool cores (slowly accreting) are able to
inherit volatile rich solids. Given Jupiter's nitrogen enrichment, if it formed

sensing enables transformative applications in remote health care, security,

channel state information (CSI) computed from Wi-Fi packets to classify events
of interest. However, most of these algorithms require a significant amount of
data collection, as well as extensive computational power for additional CSI
feature extraction. Moreover, the majority of these models suffer from poor
accuracy when tested in a new/untrained environment. In this paper, we propose
ReWiS, a novel framework for robust and environment-independent Wi-Fi sensing.
The key innovation of ReWiS is to leverage few-shot learning (FSL) as the
inference engine, which (i) reduces the need for extensive data collection and
application-specific feature extraction; (ii) can rapidly generalize to new
tasks by leveraging only a few new samples. We prototype ReWiS using
off-the-shelf Wi-Fi equipment and showcase its performance by considering a
compelling use case of human activity recognition. Thus, we perform an
extensive data collection campaign in three different propagation environments
with two human subjects. We evaluate the impact of each diversity component on
the performance and compare ReWiS with a traditional convolutional neural
network (CNN) approach. Experimental results show that ReWiS improves the
performance by about 40% with respect to existing single-antenna low-resolution
approaches. Moreover, when compared to a CNN-based approach, ReWiS shows a 35%
more accuracy and less than 10% drop in accuracy when tested in different
environments, while the CNN drops by more than 45%.

initial masses between $\sim$7 and 11 M$_\odot$ develop massive degenerate
cores and collapse. Depending on the final structure and composition, the
outcome can range from a thermonuclear explosion, to the formation of a neutron
star in an electron-capture supernova (ECSN). It has been recently demonstrated
that stars in this mass range may initiate explosive oxygen burning when their
central densities are still below $\rho_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^{9.6}$ g cm$^{-3}$.
This makes them interesting candidates for type Ia supernovae -- which we call
(C)ONe SNe Ia -- and might have broader implications for the formation of
neutron stars via ECSNe. Here, we model the evolution of 252 helium stars with
initial masses in the $0.8-3.5$ M$_\odot$ range, and metallicities between
$Z=10^{-4}$ and $0.02$. We use these models to constrain the central densities,
compositions and envelope masses at the time of explosive oxygen ignition. We
further investigate the sensitivity of these properties to mass loss rate
assumptions using additional models with varying wind efficiencies. We find
that helium stars with masses between $\sim$1.8 and 2.7 M$_\odot$ evolve onto
$1.35-1.37$ M$_\odot$ (C)ONe cores that initiate explosive burning at central
densities between $\rm \log_{10}(\rho_c)\sim 9.3$ and 9.6. We constrain the
amount of residual carbon retained after core carbon burning, and conclude that
it plays a critical role in determining the final outcome: Chandrasekhar-mass
degenerate cores that retain more than $\sim 0.005$ M$_\odot$ of carbon result
in (C)ONe SNe Ia, while those with lower carbon mass become ECSNe. We find that
(C)ONe SNe Ia are more likely to occur at high metallicities, whereas at low
metallicities ECSNe dominate.

of topological duality methods to problems that appear in theoretical computer
science. One of the eventual goals of this approach is to derive results in
computational complexity theory by studying appropriate topological objects
which characterize them. The link which relates these two seemingly separated
fields is logic, more precisely a subdomain of finite model theory known as
logic on words. It allows for a description of complexity classes as certain
families of languages, possibly non-regular, on a finite alphabet. Very few is
known about the duality theory relative to fragments of first-order logic on
words which lie outside of the scope of regular languages. The contribution of
our work is a detailed study of such a fragment. Fixing an integer $k \geq 1$,
we consider the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}\Sigma_1[\mathcal{N}^{u}_k]$. It
corresponds to the fragment of logic on words consisting in Boolean
combinations of sentences defined by using a block of at most $k$ existential
quantifiers, letter predicates and uniform numerical predicates of arity $l \in
\{1,...,k\}$. We give a detailed study of the dual space of this Boolean

points. In the particular case where $k=1$, we are able to construct a family
of ultrafilter equations which characterize the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}
\Sigma_1[\mathcal{N}^{u}_1]$. We use topological methods in order to prove that
these equations are sound and complete with respect to the Boolean algebra we
mentioned.

P(X)$ on a domain $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$. This metric is based on a slight
refinement of the notion of generalized geodesics with respect to a base
measure $\nu$ and is relevant in particular for the case when $\nu$ is singular
with respect to $m$-dimensional Lebesgue measure; it is also closely related to
the concept of linearized optimal transport. The $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric
is defined in terms of an iterated variational problem involving optimal
transport to $\nu$; we also characterize it in terms of integrations of
classical Wasserstein distance between the conditional probabilities and
through limits of certain multi-marginal optimal transport problems. As we vary
the base measure $\nu$, the $\nu$-based Wasserstein metric interpolates between
the usual quadratic Wasserstein distance and a metric associated with the
uniquely defined generalized geodesics obtained when $\nu$ is sufficiently
regular. When $\nu$ concentrates on a lower dimensional submanifold of
$\mathbb{R}^m$, we prove that the variational problem in the definition of the
$\nu$-based Wasserstein distance has a unique solution. We establish geodesic
convexity of the usual class of functionals and of the set of source measures
$\mu$ such that optimal transport between $\mu$ and $\nu$ satisfies a
strengthening of the generalized nestedness condition introduced in
\cite{McCannPass20}.We finally introduce a slight variant of the dual metric
mentioned above in order to prove convergence of an iterative scheme to solve a
variational problem arising in game theory.

with the Standard Model (SM) sector via neutrino- and vector-portals.
Essentially, quasi-sterile neutrinos are light dark sector fermions with two
generic properties: (i) they mix with the active neutrinos of the SM, and (ii)
they are charged under a vector mediator that couples feebly to SM matter.
Various interesting phenomenological consequences result from this class of
particles. In this article, we investigate one such consequence: new, beyond
the SM matter effects that can alter in-medium neutrino oscillations. In
particular, for special windows of energy and matter densities, active
neutrinos can resonantly oscillate into sterile neutrinos. We take advantage of
this feature to build a quasi-sterile neutrino model that can explain the
MiniBooNE and LSND anomalies, while remaining compatible with observations from
long-baseline reactor- and accelerator-based neutrino experiments. This model
is also likely compatible with the recent results reported by the MicroBooNE
collaboration (albeit we cannot precisely quantify this claim due to a lack of

demonstrate how to utilize the new method to derive all possible invariants and
eliminate dependences among them. We obtain independent sets of invariants with
low orders and low degrees for RGB images, 2D vector fields and color volume
data. Based on synthetic and real multi-channel data, we conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate the stability and discriminability of these invariants

and winds cause cloud disruption at $\sim 8\%$ star formation efficiency (SFE),
and the first supernova at $8.3 \rm Myr$ comes too late to influence star
formation significantly. The per-freefall SFE is dynamic, accelerating from 0

compresses it to a narrower range. The primary cluster forms hierarchically and
condenses to a brief ($\sim 1\,\mathrm{Myr}$) compact ($\sim 1 \rm pc$) phase,
but does not virialize before the cloud disperses, and the stars end as an
unbound expanding association. The initial mass function resembles the Chabrier

M_\odot$. Stellar accretion takes $\sim 400 \rm kyr$ on average, but $\gtrsim
1\rm Myr$ for $>10 M_\odot$ stars, so massive stars finish growing latest. The
fraction of stars in multiples increases as a function of primary mass, as
observed. Overall, the simulation much more closely resembles reality, compared
to variations which neglect different feedback physics entirely. But more
detailed comparison with synthetic observations is necessary to constrain the

is a strong predictor of patients' survival outcomes with HNSCC. It is
essential to detect the occurrence of ECE as it changes staging and management
for the patients. Current clinical ECE detection relies on visual
identification and pathologic confirmation conducted by radiologists. Machine
learning (ML)-based ECE diagnosis has shown high potential in the recent years.
However, manual annotation of lymph node region is a required data
preprocessing step in most of the current ML-based ECE diagnosis studies. In
addition, this manual annotation process is time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and error-prone. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Gradient Mapping Guided
Explainable Network (GMGENet) framework to perform ECE identification
automatically without requiring annotated lymph node region information. The
gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) technique is proposed to
guide the deep learning algorithm to focus on the regions that are highly
related to ECE. Informative volumes of interest (VOIs) are extracted without
labeled lymph node region information. In evaluation, the proposed method is
well-trained and tested using cross validation, achieving test accuracy and AUC
of 90.2% and 91.1%, respectively. The presence or absence of ECE has been
analyzed and correlated with gold standard histopathological findings.

phenomena. We claim that it is better to ""fill the space"" with linear
combinations of smooth higher-order B-splines base functions as employed by
isogeometric analysis and utilize the neural networks to adjust the
coefficients of linear combinations. In other words, the possibilities of using
neural networks for approximating the B-spline base functions' coefficients and
by approximating the solution directly are evaluated. Solving differential
equations with neural networks has been proposed by Maziar Raissi et al. in
2017 by introducing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), which naturally
encode underlying physical laws as prior information. Approximation of
coefficients using a function as an input leverages the well-known capability
of neural networks being universal function approximators. In essence, in the
PINN approach the network approximates the value of the given field at a given
point. We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is
approximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and
the neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research
compares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear
combination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the
solution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when
approximating smooth physical fields.

S$_{m}$ (superconducting film covered by a thin ferromagnetic layer), spin
filters Fl and a ferromagnetic layer F with or without DW (DWs). The spin
filters Fl allow electrons to pass with one specific spin orientation, such
that the Josephson coupling is governed by a fully polarized long-range triplet
component. In the absence of DW(s), the Josephson and spin currents are nonzero
when the right and left filters, Fl$_{r,l}$, pass electrons with equal spin
orientation and differ only by a temperature-independent factor. They become
zero when the \textbf{spins} of the triplet Cooper pairs passing through the
Fl$_{r,l}$ have opposite directions. Furthermore, for the different chiralities
of the injected triplet Cooper pairs the spontaneous currents arise in the
junction yielding a diode effect. Once a DW is introduced, it reduces the
critical Josephson current $I_{c}$ in the case of equal spin polarization and
makes it finite in the case of opposite spin orientation. The critical current
$I_{c}$ is maximal when the DW is in the center of the F film. A deviation of
the DW from the center generates a force that pushes the DW to the center of
the F film. In addition, we consider the case of an arbitrary number $N$ of
DW's, with the case $N=2$ corresponding to a model system for a magnetic
skyrmion.

mobile user equipments (UEs) with computing/communications resources from edge
nodes (ENs), enabling new services (e.g., real-time gaming). However, despite
being more resourceful than UEs, allocating ENs' resources to a given favorable
set of users (e.g., closer to ENs) may block other UEs from their services.
This is often the case for most existing approaches that only aim to maximize
the network social welfare or minimize the total energy consumption but do not
consider the computing/battery status of each UE. This work develops an
energy-based proportional-fair framework to serve all users with multiple tasks
while considering both their service requirements and energy/battery levels in
a multi-layer edge network. The resulting problem for offloading tasks and
allocating resources toward the tasks is a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming,
which is NP-hard. To tackle it, we leverage the fact that the relaxed problem
is convex and propose a distributed algorithm, namely the dynamic
branch-and-bound Benders decomposition (DBBD). DBBD decomposes the original
problem into a master problem (MP) for the offloading decisions and multiple
subproblems (SPs) for resource allocation. To quickly eliminate inefficient
offloading solutions, MP is integrated with powerful Benders cuts exploiting
the ENs' resource constraints. We then develop a dynamic branch-and-bound
algorithm (DBB) to efficiently solve MP considering the load balance among ENs.
SPs can either be solved for their closed-form solutions or be solved in
parallel at ENs, thus reducing the complexity. The numerical results show that
DBBD returns the optimal solution in maximizing the proportional fairness among
UEs. DBBD has higher fairness indexes, i.e., Jain's index and min-max ratio, in
comparison with the existing ones that minimize the total consumed energy.

that traditional diagnosis is a lengthy, labor-intensive process, significant
attention has been given to developing systems that automatically screen for
autism. Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with
affected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia,
monotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress
patterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to
detect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and
neurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to
detect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio
features (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec
2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers
on our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from
Stanford's Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of
autistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random
Forest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model

children's audio as either ASD or NT. Our models were able to predict autism

CBF and CLF for the full-stack system directly in the observation space of the
robot, without the need to assume a separate perception-based state estimator.
Our hybrid controller, called LOCUS (Learning-enabled Observation-feedback

consistently reach its goal, and generalizes safely to environments outside of

pre-grasping to reduce the degree of the entanglement, 2) post-grasping to
adjust the grasped mass using a novel gripper mechanism to carefully discard
excess food when the grasped amount is larger than the target mass, and 3)
selecting the grasping point to grasp an amount likely to be reasonably higher

we report the first detection of HC18O+(4-3) in a Class II protoplanetary disk
(TW Hya). This detection allows us to explore the oxygen isotope fractionation
of CO in the TW Hya disk from optically thin HCO+ isotopologues as a proxy of
optically thicker CO isotopologues. Using the H13CO+(4-3) data previously
obtained with SMA, we find that the H13CO+/HC18O+ ratio in the central <100 au
regions of the disk is 10.3 +- 3.2. We construct a chemical model of the TW Hya
disk with carbon and oxygen isotope fractionation chemistry, and estimate the
conversion factor from H13CO+/HC18O+ to 13CO/C18O. With the conversion factor
(= 0.8), the 13CO/C18O ratio is estimated to be 8.3 +- 2.6, which is consistent
with the elemental abundance ratio in the local ISM (8.1 +- 0.8) within error
margin. Then there is no clear evidence of 18O depletion in CO gas of the disk,
although we could not draw any robust conclusion due to large uncertainties. In
conclusion, optically thin lines of HCO+ isotopologues are useful tracers of CO
isotopic ratios, which are hardly constrained directly from optically thick
lines of CO isotopologues. Future higher sensitivity observations of H13CO+ and
HC18O+ would be able to allow us to better constrain the oxygen fractionation

formulate and solve equations of the density distributions in $\nu$-clusters.
In the non-relativistic case, they are reduced to the Lane-Emden equation. We
find that (i) stable configurations exist for any number of neutrinos, $N$;
(ii) there is a maximal central density $\sim 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$ determined by the

possibility realized for $S_\phi > 700$ is the development of instabilities in

improving clinical decision support and outcome prediction. However, accurate
segmentation of splenic vascular injury is challenging for the following
reasons: 1) Splenic vascular injury can be highly variant in shape, texture,
size, and overall appearance; and 2) Data acquisition is a complex and
expensive procedure that requires intensive efforts from both data scientists
and radiologists, which makes large-scale well-annotated datasets hard to
acquire in general.
  In light of these challenges, we hereby design a novel framework for
multi-phase splenic vascular injury segmentation, especially with limited data.
On the one hand, we propose to leverage external data to mine pseudo splenic
masks as the spatial attention, dubbed external attention, for guiding the
segmentation of splenic vascular injury. On the other hand, we develop a
synthetic phase augmentation module, which builds upon generative adversarial
networks, for populating the internal data by fully leveraging the relation
between different phases. By jointly enforcing external attention and
populating internal data representation during training, our proposed method
outperforms other competing methods and substantially improves the popular
DeepLab-v3+ baseline by more than 7% in terms of average DSC, which confirms
its effectiveness.

always the same for the same applied waveform, and is readily reversed by
changing the sign of the applied waveform, for example, by swapping which

mechanical systems, and we discuss the implications for facile control of
object motion using tunable periodic driving forces.

evolution of massive stars. In the present work, we present a light curve (LC)
model for the ejecta-CSM interaction, taking into account the processes in
which the high-energy photons originally created at the forward and reverse
shocks are converted to the observed emission in the optical. The model is
applied to a sample of SNe Ibn and `SN Ibn' rapidly evolving transients. We
show that the characteristic post-peak behavior commonly seen in the SN Ibn
LCs, where a slow decay is followed by a rapid decay, is naturally explained by
the transition of the forward-shock property from cooling to adiabatic regime
without introducing a change in the CSM density distribution. The
(commonly-found) slope in the rapid decay phase indicates a steep CSM density
gradient (rho_CSM ~ r^{-3}), inferring a rapid increase in the mass-loss rate
toward the SN as a generic properties of the SN Ibn progenitors. From the
derived ejecta and CSM properties, we argue that massive Wolf-Rayet stars with
the initial mass of >~ 18 Msun can be a potential class of the progenitors. The
present work also indicates existence of currently missing population of
UV-bright rapid transients for which the final mass-loss rate is lower than the
optical SNe Ibn, which can be efficiently probed by future UV missions.

the similitude of the declining forces of different deadrise angles in the

formulated by an added mass coefficient with an averaged increase of 27.13%

important role in the field of information management, privacy protection is an
important and concerning topic in current machine learning models. In
information management field, a large number of texts containing personal
information are produced by users every day. As the model training on
information from users is likely to invade personal privacy, many methods have
been proposed to block the learning and memorizing of the sensitive data in raw
texts. In this paper, we try to do this more linguistically via distorting the
text while preserving the semantics. In practice, we leverage a recently our
proposed metric, Neighboring Distribution Divergence, to evaluate the semantic
preservation during the distortion. Based on the metric, we propose two
frameworks for semantics-preserved distortion, a generative one and a
substitutive one. We conduct experiments on named entity recognition,
constituency parsing, and machine reading comprehension tasks. Results from our
experiments show the plausibility and efficiency of our distortion as a method
for personal privacy protection. Moreover, we also evaluate the attribute
attack on three privacy-related tasks in the current natural language
processing field, and the results show the simplicity and effectiveness of our
data-based improvement approach compared to the structural improvement
approach. Further, we also investigate the effects of privacy protection in
specific medical information management in this work and show that the medical
information pre-training model using our approach can effectively reduce the
memory of patients and symptoms, which fully demonstrates the practicality of
our approach.

high above the galactic plane but with weak suppression of star formation.
Additional mechanical feedback further suppressed star formation and brought

represents group interactions as hyperedges (i.e., arbitrary-sized subsets of
nodes). Such group interactions are ubiquitous in many domains: the sender and
receivers of an email, the co-authors of a publication, and the items
co-purchased by a customer, to name a few. A higher-order interaction (HOI) in
a hypergraph is defined as the co-appearance of a set of nodes in any
hyperedge. Our focus is the persistence of HOIs repeated over time, which is
naturally interpreted as the strength of group relationships, aiming at
answering three questions: (a) How do HOIs in real-world hypergraphs persist
over time? (b) What are the key factors governing the persistence? (c) How
accurately can we predict the persistence?
  In order to answer the questions above, we investigate the persistence of
HOIs in 13 real-world hypergraphs from 6 domains. First, we define how to
measure the persistence of HOIs. Then, we examine global patterns and anomalies
in the persistence, revealing a power-law relationship. After that, we study
the relations between the persistence and 16 structural features of HOIs, some
of which are closely related to the persistence. Lastly, based on the 16
structural features, we assess the predictability of the persistence under
various settings and find strong predictors of the persistence. Note that
predicting the persistence of HOIs has many potential applications, such as
recommending items to be purchased together and predicting missing recipients
of emails.

new algorithm only requires information about the size of the errors in the
function evaluations and incurs no additional computational expense. It is
shown that, when applied to a smooth (but not necessarily convex) objective
function, the iterates of the algorithm visit a neighborhood of stationarity
infinitely often, and that the rest of the sequence cannot stray too far away,
as measured by function values. Numerical results illustrate how the classical
trust region algorithm may fail in the presence of noise, and how the proposed
algorithm ensures steady progress towards stationarity in these cases.

the extended atmospheres of short-period exoplanets. With the advancement of
ultra-stable echelle spectrographs and the advent of 30-meter class telescopes
on the horizon, even minor observational and physical effects will become
important when modeling atmospheric absorption of atomic species. In this work
we demonstrate how the non-uniform temperature across the surface of a fast
rotating star, i.e., gravity darkening, can affect the observed transmission
spectrum in a handful of atomic transitions commonly observed in short-period
exoplanet atmospheres. We simulate transits of the ultra-hot Jupiters KELT-9 b

transiting rapidly rotating stars. In general, we find that gravity darkening
has a small effect on the average transmission spectrum but can change the
shape of the absorption light curve, similar to the effect observed in
broadband photometric transits. While the magnitude of gravity darkening
effects are on the same order as the noise in transmission spectra observed
with 10-meter class telescopes, future high-quality spectroscopic light curves
for individual atomic absorption lines collected with 30-meter class telescopes
will need to account for this effect.

computing, proposes giving each user ability to select between available cloud
providers.
  In this paper, we present our serverless-edge co-design, which extends the
Sky computing vision. In our serverless-edge co-design, we expect edge devices
to collaborate and spawn required number of serverless functions. This raises
several key challenges: (1) how will this collaboration take place, (2) what if
some edge devices are compromised, and (3) what if a selected cloud provider is
malicious. Hence, we design ServerlessBFT, the first protocol to guarantee
Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) transactional flow between edge devices and
serverless functions. We present an exhaustive list of attacks and their
solutions on our serverless-edge co-design. Further, we extensively benchmark
our architecture on a variety of parameters.

models mostly rely on the encoder's latent visual representation. Recent
progress on the encoder-decoder model attends encoder features mainly in linear
interaction with the decoder. However, growing model complexity for visual data
encourages more explicit feature interaction for fine-grained information,
which is currently absent in the video captioning domain. Moreover, feature
aggregations methods have been used to unveil richer visual representation,
either by the concatenation or using a linear layer. Though feature sets for a
video semantically overlap to some extent, these approaches result in objective
mismatch and feature redundancy. In addition, diversity in captions is a
fundamental component of expressing one event from several meaningful
perspectives, currently missing in the temporal, i.e., video captioning domain.
To this end, we propose Variational Stacked Local Attention Network (VSLAN),
which exploits low-rank bilinear pooling for self-attentive feature interaction
and stacking multiple video feature streams in a discount fashion. Each feature
stack's learned attributes contribute to our proposed diversity encoding
module, followed by the decoding query stage to facilitate end-to-end diverse

evaluate VSLAN on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets in terms of syntax and diversity.
The CIDEr score of VSLAN outperforms current off-the-shelf methods by $7.8\%$

existing approaches focus on single-domain fake news detection (SFND), which
leads to unsatisfying performance when these methods are applied to
multi-domain fake news detection. As an emerging field, multi-domain fake news
detection (MFND) is increasingly attracting attention. However, data
distributions, such as word frequency and propagation patterns, vary from
domain to domain, namely domain shift. Facing the challenge of serious domain
shift, existing fake news detection techniques perform poorly for multi-domain

In this paper, we first design a benchmark of fake news dataset for MFND with
domain label annotated, namely Weibo21, which consists of 4,488 fake news and
4,640 real news from 9 different domains. We further propose an effective
Multi-domain Fake News Detection Model (MDFEND) by utilizing a domain gate to
aggregate multiple representations extracted by a mixture of experts. The

enabling channel recovery from multiple observations across subcarriers via
multiple measurement vectors (MMV). Using the temporal correlation, MMV least

spreading loss structure, a channel refinement algorithm is proposed to
estimate the path coefficients and time delays of the dominant paths. To reduce
the computational complexity and enhance the beam resolution, a sequential
search method using hierarchical codebooks is developed. Numerical results
demonstrate the improved channel estimation accuracy of MMV-LS-CS over

galaxy. We constrain the physical size of QRS121102 by measuring its
flux-density variability with the VLA in the Ku-band (12 to 18 GHz) and the
K-band (18 to 26 GHz). Any such variability would likely be due to Galactic
refractive scintillation and would require the source radius to be <10^17 cm at
the host-galaxy redshift. We found the radio variability to be lower than the
scintillation theory predictions for such a small source, leaving open the
possibility for non-AGN models for QRS121102. In addition, we roughly estimated
the mass of any potential supermassive black hole (SMBH) associated with
QRS121102 from the width of the H\alpha emission line using a medium-resolution
optical spectrum from the Keck Observatory. The line width gives a velocity
dispersion of <30 km/s, indicating a SMBH mass of <10^{4~5} M_sun. We find the
SMBH mass too low for the observed radio luminosity, and X-ray luminosity
constraints, if QRS121102 were an AGN. Finally, some dwarf galaxies that host
SMBH may be the stripped cores of massive galaxies during the tidal
interactions with companion systems. We find no nearby galaxy at the same
redshift as the QRS121102 host from low-resolution Keck spectra, or from the
PanSTARRS catalog. In conclusion, we find no evidence supporting the hypothesis
that the persistent radio source associated with FRB 121102 is an AGN. We
instead argue that the inferred size, and the flat radio spectrum, favors a
plerion interpretation. We urge continued broadband radio monitoring of

excitations. Weakly correlated holelike carriers in the $d_{xy}$-derived band
dominate the transport properties and exhibit the Anderson localization,

Multi-Representation Adaptation which can dramatically improve the

hybrid structure named Inception Adaptation Module (IAM). Based on this, we
present Multi-Representation Adaptation Network (MRAN) to accomplish the
cross-domain image classification task via multi-representation alignment which
can capture the information from different aspects. In addition, we extend
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute the adaptation loss. Our approach can
be easily implemented by extending most feed-forward models with IAM, and the
network can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments conducted
on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MRAN. The

be typically collected from multiple diverse sources, and they might be
different not only from the target domain but also from each other. Thus,
domain adapters from multiple sources should not be modeled in the same way.
Recent deep learning based Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MUDA)
algorithms focus on extracting common domain-invariant representations for all
domains by aligning distribution of all pairs of source and target domains in a
common feature space. However, it is often very hard to extract the same
domain-invariant representations for all domains in MUDA. In addition, these
methods match distributions without considering domain-specific decision
boundaries between classes. To solve these problems, we propose a new framework
with two alignment stages for MUDA which not only respectively aligns the
distributions of each pair of source and target domains in multiple specific
feature spaces, but also aligns the outputs of classifiers by utilizing the
domain-specific decision boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can achieve remarkable results on popular benchmark datasets for image

regular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this
sequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer
from two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the
exploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To
tackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network
(HEN) to model users' behavior sequences, which could not only improve the
performance of fraud detection but also make the inference process
interpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g.,
new countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in
fraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few
data/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer
framework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to
transfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and
mature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our
proposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied

Based on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer

through molecular dynamics simulations, to be up to 48% higher relative to
basal plane bonding for 35 wt.% graphene loading with 10 layers thick
nanoplatelets. This unique result opens up promising new avenues for achieving
high thermal-conductivity polymer materials, which is of key importance for a
wide range of thermal management technologies. The anisotropy of thermal
transport in single layer graphene leads to very high in-plane thermal
conductivity (~2000 W/mK) compared to the low out-of-plane thermal conductivity
(~10 W/mK). Likewise, in multilayer graphene nanoplatelet (GnP), the thermal
conductivity across the layers is even lower due to the weak van der Waals
bonding between each pair of layers. Edge functionalization couples the polymer
chains to the high in-plane thermal conduction pathway of graphene, thus
leading to high overall high composite thermal conductivity. Basal-plane
functionalization, however, lowers the thermal resistance between the polymer
and the surface graphene sheets of the nanoplatelet only, causing the heat
conduction through inner layers to be less efficient, thus resulting in basal
plane scheme to be outperformed by edge scheme. The present study fundamentally
enables novel pathways for achieving high thermal-conductivity polymer

that our method can recover accurate spatial dependency and improve the target

ranging from scalar field based models like Quintessence and Phantom dark
energy to various modified gravity approaches as well. A very interesting idea
then is to consider scalar field dark energy models in quantum gravitationally
corrected cosmologies with the RS-II Braneworld being one of the most well
known in this regard. So in this work, we consider RS-II Braneworld based
scalar field dark energy models and try to look out for the existence of finite
time singularities in these regimes both through a dynamical system
perspective, for which we employ the Goriely-Hyde singularity analysis method,
and a physical perspective. Our approach is general in the sense that it is not
limited to any particular class of potentials or for any constrained parameter
region for the brane tension and is valid for both Quintessence and phantom
dark energy regimes. We firstly show through Goriely-Hyde procedure that finite
time singularities can exist in these models for a limited set of initial
conditions and that this result would hold irrespective of any consideration
given to the swampland dS conjecture. We then discuss the physical nature of
the singularities that can occur in this regime, where we use a well motivated
ansatz for the Hubble parameter and show that these models of dark energy can
allow for weak singularities like those of Type III and Type IV and can also
allow for strong singularities like the Big Rip (Type I).

period by leveraging dispatch levels of generations. For each lower-dimension
polytope, the computational burden brought by multiple border buses is
alleviated by aggregating tie-line power. Also, minimum renewable curtailments
are preserved by incorporating an additional dimension in the tie-line security
region. For the coupling parameters located within our tie-line security
region, a feasible decision of the regional power system exists. Finally, the
tie-line security region is used to reduce renewable curtailments in an
interconnected power system under a decentralized and non-iterative framework.
The performance of the presented methods is corroborated in the IEEE 9-bus
system, a 661-bus utility system and a five-region system.

multiple countries could lead to improvements in long-term forecasting. Data
fed into joint models are often grouped according to nominal attributes, such

contain heterogeneity and deteriorate the forecast results. Our paper proposes
a novel clustering technique to pursue homogeneity among multiple functional
time series based on functional panel data modelling to address this issue.
Using a functional panel data model with fixed effects, we can extract common
functional time series features. These common features could be decomposed into
two components: the functional time trend and the mode of variations of
functions (functional pattern). The functional time trend reflects the dynamics
across time, while the functional pattern captures the fluctuations within
curves. The proposed clustering method searches for homogeneous age-specific
mortality rates of multiple countries by accounting for both the modes of
variations and the temporal dynamics among curves. We demonstrate that the
proposed clustering technique outperforms other existing methods through a
Monte Carlo simulation and could handle complicated cases with slow decaying
eigenvalues. In empirical data analysis, we find that the clustering results of
age-specific mortality rates can be explained by the combination of geographic
region, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic status. We further show that our model
produces more accurate forecasts than several benchmark methods in forecasting

  Newsvendor Model","main body: 39 pages, 6 figures; supplmental material: 54 pages",,,,"q-fin.RM math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  If a financial asset's price movement impacts the demand for a firm's
product, the firm can adjust its operational decisions in response to such
impact. For example, in the automotive industry, car makers decrease the
selling prices of fuel-inefficient cars when the oil price rises. Meanwhile,
the firm can implement a risk-hedging strategy using the financial asset
jointly with its operational decisions. Motivated by this, we develop and solve
a general model that integrates financial risk hedging into a price-setting
newsvendor. The optimal hedging strategy is calculated analytically, which
leads to an explicit objective function for optimizing pricing and service
levels. We find that, in general, the presence of hedging reduces the optimal
price. It also reduces the optimal service level when the asset price trend
positively impacts product demand (``asset price benefits demand''); meanwhile,
it may increase the optimal service level by a small margin when the impact is
negative (``asset price hurts demand''). We construct the mean-variance
efficient frontier that characterizes the risk-return trade-off. Our numerical
case study using Ford Motor Company's data shows that the markdown in price and
reduction in service level are small under our model, and that the hedging
strategy substantially reduces risk without materially reducing operational
profit. We further extend the model to incorporate general operational payoff
functions, deriving optimal hedging strategies and identifying crucial
structural properties of the payoff function under which hedging reduces
optimal operational levels when the asset price trend has a benefiting effect.

similarity measurement and decision-making methods; developing a new scoring
function for comparing the size of interval value generalized orthogonal fuzzy

weighted average operator (IVq-ROFYWA) and Yager weighted geometric average
operator (IVq-ROFYWG) are used for information aggregation. The CRITIC-WASPAS
combines the advantages of CRITIC and WASPAS, which not only work in the single

Finally, the group decision algorithm is used for hypertension risk management.
The results are consistent with decision-makers' opinions. Practice and case

receptive field mechanism to collect regional information, RVSM can filter high

sensitive to noise largely. Besides, due to the strong generalization of

perceptual quality: 1) center-oriented optimization (COO) problem and 2)
model's low-frequency tendency. First, POMs tend to generate an SR image whose
position in the feature space is closest to the distribution center of all
potential high-resolution (HR) images, resulting in such POMs losing
high-frequency details. Second, $90\%$ area of an image consists of
low-frequency signals; in contrast, human perception relies on an image's
high-frequency details. However, POMs apply the same calculation to process
different-frequency areas, so that POMs tend to restore the low-frequency
regions. Based on these two factors, we propose a Detail Enhanced Contrastive
Loss (DECLoss), by combining a high-frequency enhancement module and spatial
contrastive learning module, to reduce the influence of the COO problem and
low-Frequency tendency. Experimental results show the efficiency and
effectiveness when applying DECLoss on several regular SR models. E.g, in EDSR,
our proposed method achieves 3.60$\times$ faster learning speed compared to a
GAN-based method with a subtle degradation in visual quality. In addition, our
final results show that an SR network equipped with our DECLoss generates more

Caching popular files at small base stations (SBSs) can offload the backhaul

the Higgs boson and an avenue to uncover new physics at the Large Hadron
Collider. This channel provides the most stringent bound on Higgs' invisible
decay branching ratio, where the current upper limits are significantly higher
than the one expected in the Standard Model. It is remarkable that merely
low-level calorimeter data from this characteristically simple process can
improve this limit substantially by employing sophisticated deep-learning
techniques. The construction of such neural networks seems to comprehend the
event kinematics and radiation pattern exceptionally well. However, the full
potential of this outstanding capability also warrants a precise theoretical
projection of QCD parton showering and corresponding radiation pattern. This
work demonstrates the relation using different recoil schemes in the parton

Here we present a pilot study using multiresolution modal decomposition (mrDMD)
to identify the optimal placement of PM2.5 sensors from 2000-2016 over the
contiguous United States. This novel approach incorporates the variation of
PM2.5 on timescales ranging from one day to over a decade to capture air
pollution variability. We find that the mrDMD algorithm identifies
high-priority sensor locations in the western United States, but a
significantly lower density of sensors than expected along the eastern coast,
where a large number of EPA PM2.5 monitors currently reside. Specifically, 53%
of mrDMD optimized sensor locations are west of the 100th meridian, compared to
only 32% in the current EPA network. The mrDMD sensor locations can capture
PM2.5 from wildfires and high pollution events, with particularly high skill in
the West. These results suggest significant gaps in the current EPA monitoring
network in the San Joaquin Valley in California, northern California, and in
the Pacific Northwest (Idaho, and Eastern Washington and Oregon). Our framework
diagnoses where to place air quality sensors so that they can best monitor
smoke from wildfires. Our framework may also be applied to urban areas for

black-box machine learning models have been introduced. Unfortunately, all of
these methods suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: They are
either difficult to understand themselves, they work on a per-feature basis and
ignore the dependencies between features and/or they only focus on those
features asserting the decision made by the model. To address these points,
this work introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach called Monte Carlo
tree search for eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (McXai) to explain the
decisions of any black-box classification model (classifier). Our method
leverages Monte Carlo tree search and models the process of generating
explanations as two games. In one game, the reward is maximized by finding
feature sets that support the decision of the classifier, while in the second
game, finding feature sets leading to alternative decisions maximizes the
reward. The result is a human friendly representation as a tree structure, in
which each node represents a set of features to be studied with smaller
explanations at the top of the tree. Our experiments show, that the features
found by our method are more informative with respect to classifications than
those found by classical approaches like LIME and SHAP. Furthermore, by also
identifying misleading features, our approach is able to guide towards improved
robustness of the black-box model in many situations.

the embedded solar magnetic field that permeates the heliosphere, changing
significantly over an 11-year solar cycle. Energy spectra of GCRs measured
during different epochs of solar activity provide crucial information for a
thorough understanding of solar and heliospheric phenomena. The PAMELA

of the time dependence of the helium nuclei fluxes over a nearly full solar

Second, we propose an active learning strategy to guide the user towards the

of wetting properties of structured surfaces containing lamellae with an
exceptionally high aspect ratio - height/width ratio demonstrated of 57:1. The
lamellar surface was made using a polymer with tunable mechanical properties,
and shape-memory behavior. It was found that wetting properties of such
structured surfaces depend on temperature and thermal treatment history -
lamellae are wetted easier at elevated temperature or after cooling to room
temperature when the polymer is soft because of the easier deformability of
lamellae. The shape of lamellae deformed by droplets can be temporarily fixed
at low temperature and remains fixed upon heating to room temperature. Heating
above the transition temperature of the shape-memory polymer restores the
orginal shape. The high aspect ratio allows tuning of geometry not only
manually, as it is done in most works reported previously, but can also be made
by a liquid droplet and is controlled by temperature. The liquid in combination
with thermoresponsive topography present a new kind of wetting behavior.
Moreover, the mechanical properties can be controlled - the polymer can either
be hard or soft at room temperature depending on thermal pre-history. This
behavior opens new opportunities for the design of novel smart elements for
microfluidic devices such as smart valves, whose state and behavior can be
switched by thermal stimuli: valves can or cannot be opened, are able to close
or can be fixed in an open or closed states.

profiles in dwarf galaxies, known as the cusp-core problem. Particularly, we
aim to focus on gas-poor dwarf galaxies. One of the most promising solutions to
this cold dark matter small scale issue is the stellar feedback but it seems to
be only designed for gas-rich dwarfs. However, in the regime of classical
dwarfs, this core mechanism becomes negligible. Therefore, it is required to
find solutions without invoking these baryonic processes as dark matter cores
tend to persist even for these dwarfs, which are rather dark matter-dominated.
Here we have presented two categories of solutions. One consists of creating
dark matter cores from cusps within cold dark matter by altering the dark
matter potential via perturbers. The second category gathers solutions which
depict the natural emergence of dark matter cores in alternative theories.
Given the wide variety of solutions, it becomes necessary to identify which
mechanism dominates in the central region of galaxies by finding observational
signatures left by them in order to highlight the true nature of dark matter.

be approximately $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ with a difference of unity in orders at
galactic and planetary scales and seems to provide a unique $f(R)$ at local
scales. Further, at late cosmic time, we analyse the constraint on $\delta$ via
the bare scalar self-interaction Einstein frame potential to provide a null
test of dark energy. We constrain the deviation parameter, $\mid\delta\mid$ to
$(\approx 0.6)$ which is in a close agreement with the results obtained through
various observations in the Jordan frame by several authors. Our results
suggest that the present form of model is suitable for the alternate
explanation of dark matter-like effects at local scales, whereas at large
scales the deviations grow higher and must be addressed in terms of the
accelerated background.

muscle fatigue assessment and MSD risk analysis, in this paper, a new muscle
fatigue model was proposed. The new proposed model reflects the influence of
external load, workload history, and individual differences. This model is
simple in mathematics and can be easily applied in realtime calculation, such
as the application in realtime virtual work simulation and evaluation. The new
model was mathematically validated with 24 existing static models by comparing
the calculated METs, and qualitatively or quantitatively validated with 3
existing dynamic models. The proposed model shows high or moderate similarities
in predicting the METs with all the 24 static models. Validation results with
the three dynamic models were also promising. The main limitation of the model
is that it still lacks experimental validation for more dynamic situations.
Relevance to industry Muscle fatigue is one of the main reasons causing MSDs in

physics due to complex interactions between the coupled wakes. However, their
mutual interference effects have not been elucidated in a quantitative manner
thus far. In this paper, we create a mismatch between the two wakes by
introducing a size difference in the cylinder pair, such that the effects of
one wake on the other can be distinguished. Depending on the size and gap
ratios between the two cylinders, the coupled wake exhibits distinct dynamical
features including the quasi-periodic flow, synchronized flow, and chaotic
flow. Through advanced spectral analysis of lift coefficients and dynamic mode
decomposition of the flow fields, we reveal that the quasi-periodic flows are
mainly composed of two primary frequencies associated with vortex shedding in
the near wakes of the two cylinders. Both wakes impose their own frequencies on
the other, resulting in the beating phenomenon in the lift coefficients. The
triad interactions between the two wakes generate the sideband frequencies,
which are associated with modal structures that are mostly active in the far
wake. The transition from quasi-periodicity to synchronization is dominated by
the vortex shedding behind the larger cylinder, to which the wake of the
smaller cylinder locks in. These results reveal new insights on the coupled
wakes of two circular cylinders, and are pivotal for understanding more general
wake interaction problems.

operate in an open world, where they are tasked to identify pixels belonging to
unknown objects and eventually to learn novel classes, incrementally. Humans
have the capability to say: I don't know what that is, but I've already seen
something like that. Therefore, it is desirable to perform such an incremental
learning task in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce a method where unknown
objects are clustered based on visual similarity. Those clusters are utilized
to define new classes and serve as training data for unsupervised incremental
learning. More precisely, the connected components of a predicted semantic
segmentation are assessed by a segmentation quality estimate. connected
components with a low estimated prediction quality are candidates for a
subsequent clustering. Additionally, the component-wise quality assessment
allows for obtaining predicted segmentation masks for the image regions
potentially containing unknown objects. The respective pixels of such masks are
pseudo-labeled and afterwards used for re-training the DNN, i.e., without the
use of ground truth generated by humans. In our experiments we demonstrate
that, without access to ground truth and even with few data, a DNN's class

statistics. It is also known as kriging and is the Bayesian counterpart to the
frequentist kernel ridge regression. Most of the theoretical work on GP
regression has focused on a large-$n$ asymptotics, characterising the behaviour
of GP regression as the amount of data increases. Fixed-sample analysis is much
more difficult outside of simple cases, such as locations on a regular grid. In
this work we perform a fixed-sample analysis that was first studied in the
context of approximation theory by Driscoll & Fornberg (2002), called the ""flat
limit"". In flat-limit asymptotics, the goal is to characterise kernel methods
as the length-scale of the kernel function tends to infinity, so that kernels
appear flat over the range of the data. Surprisingly, this limit is
well-defined, and displays interesting behaviour: Driscoll & Fornberg showed
that radial basis interpolation converges in the flat limit to polynomial
interpolation, if the kernel is Gaussian. Leveraging recent results on the
spectral behaviour of kernel matrices in the flat limit, we study the flat
limit of Gaussian process regression. Results show that Gaussian process
regression tends in the flat limit to (multivariate) polynomial regression, or
(polyharmonic) spline regression, depending on the kernel. Importantly, this
holds for both the predictive mean and the predictive variance, so that the
posterior predictive distributions become equivalent. Our results have
practical consequences: for instance, they show that optimal GP predictions in
the sense of leave-one-out loss may occur at very large length-scales, which
would be invisible to current implementations because of numerical
difficulties.

only requires a (primal) algorithm for solving the certain problem. It is thus
particularly useful in case the underlying problem is hard to solve, or only
defined implicitly by a given software addressing the certain case. The idea of
our algorithm is to solve the convex relaxation of the robust problem by a
simplicial decomposition approach, the main challenge being the
non-differentiability of the objective function in the case of discrete or
polytopal uncertainty. The resulting dual bounds are then used within a
tailored branch-and-bound framework for solving the robust problem to
optimality. By a computational evaluation, we show that our method outperforms
straightforward linearization approaches on the robust minimum spanning tree
problem. Moreover, using the Concorde solver for the certain oracle, our
approach computes much better dual bounds for the robust traveling salesman

where each sample has multi-view features, and multiple labels are correlated
via common views. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to cope
with it and achieve much success, but still suffer from two key problems: 1)
lack the ability to deal with the incomplete multi-view weak-label data, in
which only a subset of features and labels are provided for each sample; 2)
ignore the presence of noisy views and tail labels usually occurring in
real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named CEMENT, to
overcome the limitations. For 1), CEMENT jointly embeds incomplete views and
weak labels into distinct low-dimensional subspaces, and then correlates them
via Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). For 2), CEMEMT adaptively
learns the weights of embeddings to capture noisy views, and explores an
additional sparse component to model tail labels, making the low-rankness
available in the multi-label setting. We develop an alternating algorithm to
solve the proposed optimization problem. Experimental results on seven
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Adversarial detection, which distinguishes adversarial images from benign
images, is fundamental for robust DNN-based services. Image transformation is
one of the most effective approaches to detect adversarial examples. During the
last few years, a variety of image transformations have been studied and
discussed to design reliable adversarial detectors. In this paper, we
systematically synthesize the recent progress on adversarial detection via
image transformations with a novel classification method. Then, we conduct
extensive experiments to test the detection performance of image
transformations against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we
reveal that each individual transformation is not capable of detecting
adversarial examples in a robust way, and propose a DNN-based approach referred
to as \emph{AdvJudge}, which combines scores of 9 image transformations.
Without knowing which individual scores are misleading or not misleading,
AdvJudge can make the right judgment, and achieve a significant improvement in
detection rate. Finally, we utilize an explainable AI tool to show the
contribution of each image transformation to adversarial detection.
Experimental results show that the contribution of image transformations to
adversarial detection is significantly different, the combination of them can
significantly improve the generic detection ability against state-of-the-art
adversarial attacks.

been providing high-quality information for a long period of time, the level of
utility of the information is not high because it focuses on administrative
information. While this is the case, a three-dimensional (3D) map with higher
resolution has emerged along with the technological development. However, it
cannot function better than visual transmission, as it includes only image
information focusing on the exterior of the building. If information related to
the exterior of the building can be extracted or identified from a 3D map, it
is expected that the utility of the information will be more valuable as the
national architectural administration information can then potentially be
extended to include such information regarding the building exteriors to the
level of BIM(Building Information Modeling). This study aims to present and
assess a basic method of extracting information related to the appearance of
the exterior of a building for the purpose of 3D mapping using deep learning
and digital image processing. After extracting and preprocessing images from
the map, information was identified using the Fast R-CNN(Regions with
Convolutional Neuron Networks) model. The information was identified using the
Faster R-CNN model after extracting and preprocessing images from the map. As a
result, it showed approximately 93% and 91% accuracy in terms of detecting the
elevation and window parts of the building, respectively, as well as excellent
performance in an experiment aimed at extracting the elevation information of
the building. Nonetheless, it is expected that improved results will be
obtained by supplementing the probability of mixing the false detection rate or
noise data caused by the misunderstanding of experimenters in relation to the
unclear boundaries of windows.

leverage the instance score (i.e., confidence of the instance localization) to
indicate the pose quality for selecting the pose candidates. We consider that
there are two gaps involved in existing paradigm:~1) The instance score is not
well interrelated with the pose regression quality.~2) The instance feature
representation, which is used for predicting the instance score, does not
explicitly encode the structural pose information to predict the reasonable
score that represents pose regression quality. To address the aforementioned
issues, we propose to learn the pose regression quality-aware representation.
Concretely, for the first gap, instead of using the previous instance
confidence label (e.g., discrete {1,0} or Gaussian representation) to denote
the position and confidence for person instance, we firstly introduce the
Consistent Instance Representation (CIR) that unifies the pose regression
quality score of instance and the confidence of background into a pixel-wise
score map to calibrates the inconsistency between instance score and pose
regression quality. To fill the second gap, we further present the Query
Encoding Module (QEM) including the Keypoint Query Encoding (KQE) to encode the
positional and semantic information for each keypoint and the Pose Query
Encoding (PQE) which explicitly encodes the predicted structural pose
information to better fit the Consistent Instance Representation (CIR). By
using the proposed components, we significantly alleviate the above gaps. Our
method outperforms previous single-stage regression-based even bottom-up

transformer is introduced into the field of re-identification and achieves the
most advanced results by constructing the relationship of global features

extracting local features is inferior to that of convolutional neural network.
Therefore, we design a partial feature transformer-based person

to enhance the efficiency of vision transformer. (1) Patch full dimension
enhancement module. We design a learnable tensor with the same size as patch
sequences, which is full-dimensional and deeply embedded in patch sequences to
enrich the diversity of training samples. (2) Fusion and reconstruction module.
We extract the less important part of obtained patch sequences, and fuse them
with original patch sequence to reconstruct the original patch sequences. (3)

contact problems describing the mutual interaction between two deformable 3D
solid bodies and an interposed fluid film. The solid bodies are consistently
described based on nonlinear continuum mechanics allowing for finite
deformations and arbitrary constitutive laws. The fluid film is modelled as a
quasi-2D flow problem on the interface between the solids governed by the
averaged Reynolds equation. The averaged Reynolds equation accounts for surface
roughness utilizing spatially homogenized, effective fluid parameters and for
cavitation through a positivity constraint imposed on the pressure field. In
contrast to existing approaches, the proposed model accounts for the
co-existence of frictional contact tractions and hydrodynamic fluid tractions
at every local point on the contact surface of the interacting bodies and
covers the entire range from boundary lubrication to mixed, elastohydrodynamic,
and eventually to full film hydrodynamic lubrication in one unified modelling
framework with smooth transition between these different regimes. Critically,
the model relies on a recently proposed regularization scheme for the
mechanical contact constraint combining the advantages of classical penalty and
Lagrange multiplier approaches by expressing the mechanical contact pressure as
a function of the effective gap between the solid bodies while at the same time
limiting the minimal gap value occurring at the (theoretical) limit of
infinitely high contact pressures. From a physical point of view, this approach
can be considered as a model for the elastic deformation of surface asperities,
with a bounded magnitude depending on the interacting solids' surface
roughness. A consistent and accurate model behavior is demonstrated and
validated by employing several challenging and practically relevant benchmark
test cases.

non-stationary noise requires the analysis of time-dependent spectral
components in the resulting time series. The time-frequency distribution of the
signal power can be estimated with Gabor atoms, or wavelets, localized in time
and frequency by a window function. Such analysis is limited by the
Heisenberg-Gabor uncertainty, which does not allow a high-resolution
localization of power with individual wavelets simultaneously in time and
frequency. As a result, the temporal and spectral leakage affects the
time-frequency distribution, limiting the identification of sharp features in
the power spectrum. This paper presents a time-frequency regression method
where instead of a single window, a stack of wavelets with different windows
spanning a wide range of resolutions is used to scan power at each
time-frequency location. Such a wavelet scan (dubbed in the paper as wavescan)
extends the conventional multiresolution analysis to capture transient signals
and remove the local power variations due to the temporal and spectral leakage.
A wavelet, least affected by the leakage, is selected from the stack at each
time-frequency location to obtain the high-resolution localization of power.
The paper presents all stages of the multiresolution wavescan regression,
including the estimation of the time-varying spectrum, identification of
transient signals in the time-frequency domain, and reconstruction of the
corresponding time-domain waveforms. To demonstrate the performance of the
method, the wavescan regression is applied to the gravitational wave data from
the LIGO detectors.

M$\ddot{\rm{o}}$ssbauer nuclei in the thin-film planar cavity in this work, the
trajectories of asymmetric parameter q are studied via the collective effect of
the nuclear ensemble, which is regulated by the nuclear abundance and angle
offset. Due to the diverse controllable methods of the collective resonant
strength, there are different straight lines and arc-shape trajectories in the
complex plane, in which the slopes and the radius can be respectively adjusted
by the angle offset and nuclear abundance. It is demonstrated that the
dissipation process can be suppressed equivalently by the strong energy
exchange between the cavity and nuclear ensemble. The present results could
enrich the behaviors of the asymmetric parameter q in the complex plane and
would provide new possibility for the decoherence research through the
thin-film planar cavity.

  Observational Study","Submitted version of the journal article consisting of 27 pages",,,,"cs.MA cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Capturing and simulating intelligent adaptive behaviours within spatially
explicit individual-based models remains an ongoing challenge for researchers.
While an ever-increasing abundance of real-world behavioural data are
collected, few approaches exist that can quantify and formalise key individual
behaviours and how they change over space and time. Consequently, commonly used
agent decision-making frameworks, such as event-condition-action rules, are
often required to focus only on a narrow range of behaviours. We argue that
these behavioural frameworks often do not reflect real-world scenarios and fail
to capture how behaviours can develop in response to stimuli. There has been an
increased interest in Machine Learning methods and their potential to simulate
intelligent adaptive behaviours in recent years. One method that is beginning
to gain traction in this area is Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper
explores how RL can be applied to create emergent agent behaviours using a
simple predator-prey Agent-Based Model (ABM). Running a series of simulations,
we demonstrate that agents trained using the novel Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) algorithm behave in ways that exhibit properties of real-world
intelligent adaptive behaviours, such as hiding, evading and foraging.

black-box attacks. However, there is a trade-off between transferability and
imperceptibility of the adversarial perturbation. Prior work in this direction
often requires a fixed but large $\ell_p$-norm perturbation budget to reach a
good transfer success rate, leading to perceptible adversarial perturbations.
On the other hand, most of the current unrestricted adversarial attacks that
aim to generate semantic-preserving perturbations suffer from weaker
transferability to the target model. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware
framework to generate transferable adversarial examples with minimum changes.
Analogous to model selection in statistical machine learning, we leverage a
validation model to select the best perturbation budget for each image under
both the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm and unrestricted threat models. We propose a
principled method for the partition of training and validation models by
encouraging intra-group diversity while penalizing extra-group similarity.
Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework on balancing
imperceptibility and transferability of the crafted adversarial examples. The

equations of motion of the anomalous Hall effect with Berry's phase on the
basis of the adiabatic condition $|E_{n\pm1}-E_{n}|\gg 2\pi\hbar/T$, where $T$
is the typical time scale of the slower system and $E_{n}$ is the energy level
of the fast system.
  In the conventional definition of the adiabatic condition with $T\rightarrow
{\rm large}$ and fixed energy eigenvalues, no commutation relations are defined
for slower variables by the Bjorken-Johnson-Low prescription except for the
starting canonical commutators. On the other hand, in a singular limit
$|E_{n\pm1}-E_{n}|\rightarrow \infty$ with specific $E_{n}$ kept fixed for
which any motions of the slower variables $X_{k}$ can be treated to be
adiabatic, the non-canonical dynamical system with deformed commutators and the
Nernst effect appear. In the Born-Oppenheimer approximation based on the
canonical commutation relations, the equations of motion of the anomalous Hall
effect is obtained if one uses an auxiliary variable $X_{k}^{(n)}=X_{k}+{\cal
A}^{(n)}_{k}$ with Berry's connection ${\cal A}^{(n)}_{k}$ in the absence of
the electromagnetic vector potential $eA_{k}(X)$ and thus without the Nernst
effect. It is shown that the gauge symmetries associated with Berry's
connection and the electromagnetic vector potential $eA_{k}(X)$ are
incompatible in the canonical Hamiltonian formalism. The appearance of the
non-canonical dynamical system with the Nernst effect is a consequence of the

which involve determining the distance (in terms of matrix norms) between a
(possibly large-scale) system and its nearest uncontrollable, unstabilizable,
and unstable systems, respectively, with a prescribed affine structure. This
paper makes two main contributions. First, by demonstrating that determining
the feasibilities of RSCR and RSSZR is NP-hard when the perturbations have a
general affine parameterization, we prove that computing these radii is
NP-hard. Additionally, we prove the NP-hardness of a problem related to the
RSSR. These hardness results are independent of the matrix norm used. Second,
we develop unified rank-relaxation based algorithms for these problems, which
can handle both the Frobenius norm and the $2$-norm based problems and share
the same framework for the RSCR, RSSZR, and RSSR problems. These algorithms
utilize the low-rank structure of the original problems and relax the
corresponding rank constraints with a regularized truncated nuclear norm term.
Moreover, a modified version of these algorithms can find local optima with
performance specifications on the perturbations, under appropriate conditions.
Finally, simulations suggest that the proposed methods, despite being in a
simple framework, can find local optima as good as several existing methods.

methyl orange organic dye have been investigated. The work was carried out on a
LINAC LUE-300 at NSC KIPT. A set of tungsten plates was used as a
neutron-generating target. The electron energy was 15 MeV, the average current
was 20 mkA. The samples were located behind the lead shield and without it,
with and without a moderator. Using the Geant4 toolkit for this experiment,
neutron fluxes and their energy spectra were calculated at the location of
experimental samples without a moderator and with a moderator of different
thickness (1-5 cm). An analysis of the experimental results showed that when
objects without lead shielding and without a moderator are irradiated, the dye
molecules are completely destroyed. In the presence of lead protection, 10%
destruction of the dye molecules was observed. When a five-centimeter
polyethylene moderator was installed behind the lead shield, the destruction of
dye molecules without boric acid on thermal neutrons was practically not
observed. When the fluxes of thermal and epithermal neutrons interacted with a
dye solution containing 4% boric acid, 30% destruction of dye molecules was
observed due to the exothermic reaction 10B (n, a). The research has shown that
solutions of organic dyes are a good material for creating detectors for
recording fluxes of thermal and epithermal neutrons. Such detectors can be used
for radioecological monitoring of the environment, in nuclear power engineering
and nuclear medicine, and in the field of neutron capture therapy research in
particular.

scanning probe imaging mode, particularly well-suited for the characterisation
of ferroelectrics. The implementation of the technique is straightforward; it
involves monitoring currents that spontaneously develop between a passive
conducting atomic force microscopy tip and Earth, as the tip is scanned across
the specimen surface. However, details on the fundamental origin of contrast
and what images mean, in terms of associated ferroelectric microstructures, are
not yet fully understood. Here, by comparing information from CGM and Kelvin
Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM), obtained from the same sets of ferroelectric
domains (in both lithium niobate and barium titanate), we show that CGM
reasonably reflects the spatial derivative of the measured surface potential.
This is conceptually different from measuring local gradients in the surface
bound-charge density or in any associated screening charges: after all, we see
clear CGM signals, even when polarisation is entirely in-plane. We therefore
suggest that CGM in ferroelectrics might be more accurately called Potential
Gradient Microscopy (PGM). Intriguingly, in all cases examined, the measured
surface potential (determined both through KPFM and by integrating the CGM
signal) is of the opposite sign to that intuitively expected for a completely
clean ferroelectric in vacuum. This is commonly observed and presumed due to a
charge accumulation on the ferroelectric surface which is not easily removed.

functioning of our immune system. We study the process of phagocytosis by
considering a simplified coarse grained model of a three-dimensional vesicle,
having uniform adhesion interaction with a rigid particle, in the presence of
curved membrane proteins and active cytoskeletal forces. Complete engulfment is
achieved when the bending energy cost of the vesicle is balanced by the gain in
the adhesion energy. The presence of curved (convex) proteins reduces the
bending energy cost by self-organizing with higher density at the highly curved
leading edge of the engulfing membrane, which forms the circular rim of the
phagocytic cup that wraps around the particle. This allows the engulfment to
occur at much smaller adhesion strength. When the curved proteins exert
outwards protrusive forces, representing actin polymerization, at the leading
edge, we find that engulfment is achieved more quickly and at lower protein
density. We consider spherical as well as non-spherical particles, and find
that non-spherical particles are more difficult to engulf in comparison to the
spherical particles of the same surface area. For non-spherical particles, the
engulfment time crucially depends upon the initial orientation of the particles
with respect to the vesicle. Our model offers a mechanism for the spontaneous
self-organization of the actin cytoskeleton at the phagocytic cup, in good
agreement with recent high-resolution experimental observations.

network reconstruction (NR) from dynamics are natural synergistic tasks that
motivate the proposed evolutionary multitasking NR and CD framework, called
network collaborator (NC). In the process of NC, the NR task explicitly
transfers several better network structures for the CD task, and the CD task
explicitly transfers a better community structure to assist the NR task.
Moreover, to transfer knowledge from the NR task to the CD task, NC models the
study of CD from dynamics to find communities in the dynamic network and then
considers whether to transfer knowledge across tasks. A test suite for
multitasking NR and CD problems (MTNRCDPs) is designed to verify the
performance of NC. The experimental results conducted on the designed MTNRCDPs
have demonstrated that joint NR with CD has a synergistic effect, where the
network structure used to inform the existence of communities is also
inherently employed to improve the reconstruction accuracy, which, in turn, can
better demonstrate the discovering of the community structure. The code is

in the framework of two dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamics. The
steady-state solution is re-derived by considering a non zero viscosity via the
magnetic Prandtl number $P_m$. Moreover, contrary to the original SP model, a
particular attention is paid to the possibility that the inflowing magnetic
field $B_e$ and the length of the current layer $L$ are not necessarily fixed
and may depend on the dissipation parameters. Using two different ideally
unstable setups to form the current sheet, namely the tilt and coalescence
modes, we numerically explore the scaling relations with resistivity $\eta$ and
Prandtl number $P_m$ during the magnetic reconnection phase, and compare to the
generalized steady-state SP theoretical solution. The usual Sweet-Parker
relations are recovered in the limit of small $P_m$ and $\eta$ values, with in
particular the normalized reconnection rate being simply $S^{-1/2} (1 +
P_m)^{-1/4}$, where $S$ represents the Lundquist number $S = LV_A/\eta$ ($V_A$
being the characteristic Alfv\'en speed). In the opposite limit of higher $P_m$
and/or $\eta$ values, a significant deviation from the SP model is obtained
with a complex dependence $B_e (\eta, P_m)$ that is explored depending on the
setup considered. We discuss the importance of these results in order to

individual and societal levels. These data have important applications ranging
from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, issues must be
overcome to best serve these use cases: The data often represent a limited
sample of the population and use of the data jeopardizes privacy.
  To address these issues, we present and evaluate a system for generating
synthetic mobility data using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) which is
trained on real location data. The system takes a population distribution as
input and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population.
  Related generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing
both the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors over
longer time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with
privacy. Our system leverages RNNs' ability to generate complex and novel
sequences while retaining patterns from training data. Also, the model
introduces randomness used to calibrate the variation between the synthetic and
real data at the individual level. This is to both capture variability in human
mobility, and protect user privacy.
  Location based services (LBS) data from more than 22,700 mobile devices were
used in an experimental evaluation across utility and privacy metrics. We show
the generated mobility data retain the characteristics of the real data, while
varying from the real data at the individual level, and where this amount of
variation matches the variation within the real data.

curve (AUC) performance for imbalanced data has attracted much attention in
recent years. Although there have been several methods of AUC optimization,
scaling up AUC optimization is still an open issue due to its pairwise learning
style. Maximizing AUC in the large-scale dataset can be considered as a
non-convex and expensive problem. Inspired by the characteristic of pairwise
learning, the cheap AUC optimization task with a small-scale dataset sampled
from the large-scale dataset is constructed to promote the AUC accuracy of the
original, large-scale, and expensive AUC optimization task. This paper develops
an evolutionary multitasking framework (termed EMTAUC) to make full use of
information among the constructed cheap and expensive tasks to obtain higher
performance. In EMTAUC, one mission is to optimize AUC from the sampled
dataset, and the other is to maximize AUC from the original dataset. Moreover,
due to the cheap task containing limited knowledge, a strategy for dynamically
adjusting the data structure of inexpensive tasks is proposed to introduce more
knowledge into the multitasking AUC optimization environment. The performance
of the proposed method is evaluated on a series of binary classification
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EMTAUC is highly
competitive to single task methods and online methods. Supplementary materials

attributes like gender or race. One reason for this behavior is the encoded
societal biases in the training data (e.g., females are underrepresented),
which is aggravated in the presence of unbalanced class distributions (e.g.,
""granted"" is the minority class). State-of-the-art fairness-aware machine
learning approaches focus on preserving the \emph{overall} classification
accuracy while improving fairness. In the presence of class-imbalance, such
methods may further aggravate the problem of discrimination by denying an
already underrepresented group (e.g., \textit{females}) the fundamental rights
of equal social privileges (e.g., equal credit opportunity).
  To this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware boosting ensemble that
changes the data distribution at each round, taking into account not only the
class errors but also the fairness-related performance of the model defined
cumulatively based on the partial ensemble. Except for the in-training boosting
of the group discriminated over each round, AdaFair directly tackles imbalance
during the post-training phase by optimizing the number of ensemble learners
for balanced error performance (BER). AdaFair can facilitate different
parity-based fairness notions and mitigate effectively discriminatory outcomes.
Our experiments show that our approach can achieve parity in terms of
statistical parity, equal opportunity, and disparate mistreatment while
maintaining good predictive performance for all classes.

of soft repulsive particles in the limit of infinite spatial dimension $d$. The
gradient descent dynamics then displays a jamming transition: at low density,
it reaches zero-energy states in which particles' overlaps are fully
eliminated, while at high density the energy remains finite and overlaps
persist. At the transition, the dynamics becomes critical. In the $d\to \infty$

field theory. We analyze these equations and we present some partial progress

many heterogeneous agents, such as consumers, firms, and governments. Dynamic
general equilibrium (DGE) models are often used for macroeconomic analysis in
this setting. However, finding general equilibria is challenging using existing
theoretical or computational methods, especially when using microfoundations to
model individual agents. Here, we show how to use deep multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) to find $\epsilon$-meta-equilibria over agent
types in microfounded DGE models. Whereas standard MARL fails to learn
non-trivial solutions, our structured learning curricula enable stable
convergence to meaningful solutions. Conceptually, our approach is more
flexible and does not need unrealistic assumptions, e.g., continuous market
clearing, that are commonly used for analytical tractability. Furthermore, our
end-to-end GPU implementation enables fast real-time convergence with a large
number of RL economic agents. We showcase our approach in open and closed
real-business-cycle (RBC) models with 100 worker-consumers, 10 firms, and a
social planner who taxes and redistributes. We validate the learned solutions
are $\epsilon$-meta-equilibria through best-response analyses, show that they
align with economic intuitions, and show our approach can learn a spectrum of
qualitatively distinct $\epsilon$-meta-equilibria in open RBC models. As such,
we show that hardware-accelerated MARL is a promising framework for modeling
the complexity of economies based on microfoundations.

tests, assuming that one of the contacting bodies is rigid is an excellent
approximation to the physical phenomenon. In this work, the well-established
dual mortar method is adopted to enforce interface constraints in the finite
deformation frictionless contact of rigid and deformable bodies. The efficiency
of the nonlinear contact algorithm proposed here is based on two main
contributions. Firstly, a variational formulation of the method using the
so-called Petrov-Galerkin scheme is investigated, as it unlocks a significant
simplification by removing the need to explicitly evaluate the dual basis
functions. The corresponding first-order dual mortar interpolation is presented
in detail. Particular focus is, then, placed on the extension for second-order
interpolation by employing a piecewise linear interpolation scheme, which
critically retains the geometrical information of the finite element mesh.
Secondly, a new definition for the nodal orthonormal moving frame attached to
each contact node is suggested. It reduces the geometrical coupling between the
nodes and consequently decreases the stiffness matrix bandwidth. The proposed
contributions decrease the computational complexity of dual mortar methods for
rigid/deformable interaction, especially in the three-dimensional setting,
while preserving accuracy and robustness.

for frequency regulation (FR) by integrating model predictive control (MPC),
supervised learning (SL), reinforcement learning (RL), and high-fidelity
battery models. By taking advantage of deep neural networks (DNNs), the derived
DNN-approximated policy is computationally efficient in online implementation.
The design procedure of the proposed scheme consists of two sequential
processes: (1) the SL process, in which we first run a simulation with an MPC
embedding a low-fidelity battery model to generate a training data set, and
then, based on the generated data set, we optimize a DNN-approximated policy
using SL algorithms; and (2) the RL process, in which we utilize RL algorithms
to improve the performance of the DNN-approximated policy by balancing
short-term economic incentives and long-term battery degradation. The SL
process speeds up the subsequent RL process by providing a good initialization.
By utilizing RL algorithms, one prominent property of the proposed scheme is
that it can learn from the data generated by simulating the FR policy on the
high-fidelity battery simulator to adjust the DNN-approximated policy, which is
originally based on low-fidelity battery model. A case study using real-world
data of FR signals and prices is performed. Simulation results show that,
compared to conventional MPC schemes, the proposed deep learning-based scheme
can effectively achieve higher economic benefits of FR participation while
maintaining lower online computational cost.

the synchrotron limit for the first two pulses, supporting the synchrotron
origin in an ordered magnetic field. However, during the third pulse,
$\alpha_{\rm pt}$ exceeds the synchrotron line of death in few bins, and a

methods for two classes of problems: affine-constrained composite convex
optimization and bilinear saddle-point structured non-smooth convex
optimization. Our technique is based on a double-loop inexact accelerated
proximal gradient (APG) method for minimizing the summation of a non-smooth but
proximable convex function and two smooth convex functions with different
smoothness constants and computational costs. Compared to the standard APG
method, the inexact APG method can reduce the total computation cost if one
smooth component has higher computational cost but a smaller smoothness
constant than the other. With this property, the inexact APG method can be
applied to approximately solve the subproblems of a proximal augmented
Lagrangian method for affine-constrained composite convex optimization and the
smooth approximation for bilinear saddle-point structured non-smooth convex
optimization, where the smooth function with a smaller smoothness constant has
significantly higher computational cost. Thus it can reduce total complexity
for finding an approximately optimal/stationary solution. This technique is
similar to the gradient sliding technique in the literature. The difference is
that our inexact APG method can efficiently stop the inner loop by using a
computable condition based on a measure of stationarity violation, while the
gradient sliding methods need to pre-specify the number of iterations for the
inner loop. Numerical experiments demonstrate significantly higher efficiency
of our methods over an optimal primal-dual first-order method and the gradient
sliding methods.

The recently introduced xor filters can be faster and smaller than Bloom and

in storage as opposed to 44% for Bloom filters. Inspired by Dietzfelbinger and
Walzer, we build probabilistic filters -- called binary fuse filters -- that
are within 13% of the storage lower bound -- without sacrificing query speed.
As an additional benefit, the construction of the new binary fuse filters can
be more than twice as fast as the construction of xor filters. By slightly
sacrificing query speed, we further reduce storage to within 8% of the lower

and evolution of software systems, and manifest in a variety of symptoms during
software development. While erosion is often considered rather late, its
symptoms can act as early warnings to software developers, if detected in time.
In addition to static source code analysis, code reviews can be a source of
detecting erosion symptoms and subsequently taking action. In this study, we
investigate the erosion symptoms discussed in code reviews, as well as their
trends, and the actions taken by developers. Specifically, we conducted an
empirical study with the two most active Open Source Software (OSS) projects in
the OpenStack community (i.e., Nova and Neutron). We manually checked 21,274
code review comments retrieved by keyword search and random selection, and
identified 502 code review comments (from 472 discussion threads) that discuss
erosion. Our findings show that (1) the proportion of erosion symptoms is
rather low, yet notable in code reviews and the most frequently identified
erosion symptoms are architectural violation, duplicate functionality, and
cyclic dependency; (2) the declining trend of the identified erosion symptoms
in the two OSS projects indicates that the architecture tends to stabilize over
time; and (3) most code reviews that identify erosion symptoms have a positive
impact on removing erosion symptoms, but a few symptoms still remain and are
ignored by developers. The results suggest that (1) code review provides a
practical way to reduce erosion symptoms; and (2) analyzing the trend of
erosion symptoms can help get an insight about the erosion status of software
systems, and subsequently avoid the potential risk of architecture erosion.

materials and to represent the ratio of a material relaxation time to the
timescale of observation, and to demarcate transitions between predominantly
viscous or elastic material responses. However, this construct does not help
quantify the importance of long transients and non-monotonic stress jumps that
are often observed in more complex time-varying systems. Many of these
non-intuitive effects are lumped collectively under the term thixotropy;
however, no proper nouns are associated with the key phenomena observed in such
materials. Thixotropy arises from the ability of a complex structured fluid to
remember its prior deformation history, so it is natural to name the
dimensionless group representing such behavior with respect to the ability to
remember. In Greek mythology, Mnemosyne was mother of the nine Muses and the
goddess of memory. We thus propose the definition of a Mnemosyne number as the
dimensionless product of the thixotropic time scale and the imposed rate of
deformation. The Mnemosyne number is thus a measure of the flow strength
compared to the thixotropic timescale. Since long transients responses are
endemic to thixotropic materials, one also needs to consider the duration of
flow. The relevant dimensionless measure of this duration can be represented in
terms of a mutation number which compares the timescale of
experiment/observation to the thixotropic timescale. Collating the mutation
number and the Mnemosyne number, we construct a general two-dimensional map of
thixotropic behavior, and quantify these ideas using canonical thixotropic
models.

uncertainty in deep learning model predictions of radio galaxy classification.
We show that the level of model posterior variance for individual test samples
is correlated with human uncertainty when labelling radio galaxies. We explore
the model performance and uncertainty calibration for different weight priors
and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual weights, we
demonstrate that we can prune 30% of the fully-connected layer weights without
significant loss of performance by removing the weights with the lowest
signal-to-noise ratio. A larger degree of pruning can be achieved using a
Fisher information based ranking, but both pruning methods affect the
uncertainty calibration for Fanaroff-Riley type I and type II radio galaxies
differently. Like other work in this field, we experience a cold posterior
effect, whereby the posterior must be down-weighted to achieve good predictive
performance. We examine whether adapting the cost function to accommodate model
misspecification can compensate for this effect, but find that it does not make
a significant difference. We also examine the effect of principled data
augmentation and find that this improves upon the baseline but also does not
compensate for the observed effect. We interpret this as the cold posterior
effect being due to the overly effective curation of our training sample
leading to likelihood misspecification, and raise this as a potential issue for
Bayesian deep learning approaches to radio galaxy classification in future.

popularity of smartphones and tablets in our daily lives, since voice is the
most easiest and efficient way for human-computer interaction. This paper works
towards designing more effective speech-based interfaces to query the
structured data in relational databases. We first identify a new task named
Speech-to-SQL, which aims to understand the information conveyed by human
speech and directly translate it into structured query language (SQL)
statements. A naive solution to this problem can work in a cascaded manner,
that is, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) component followed by a
text-to-SQL component. However, it requires a high-quality ASR system and also
suffers from the error compounding problem between the two components,
resulting in limited performance. To handle these challenges, we further
propose a novel end-to-end neural architecture named SpeechSQLNet to directly
translate human speech into SQL queries without an external ASR step.
SpeechSQLNet has the advantage of making full use of the rich linguistic
information presented in speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to directly synthesize SQL based on arbitrary natural language
questions, rather than a natural language-based version of SQL or its variants
with a limited SQL grammar. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
problem and model, we further construct a dataset named SpeechQL, by
piggybacking the widely-used text-to-SQL datasets. Extensive experimental
evaluations on this dataset show that SpeechSQLNet can directly synthesize
high-quality SQL queries from human speech, outperforming various competitive
counterparts as well as the cascaded methods in terms of exact match
accuracies.

Events, meteors and meteoroids, the observation of sea bioluminescence and of
artificial satellites and man-made space debris. It is also capable of
observing Extensive Air Showers generated by Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays with
an energy above 10$^{21}$ eV and detect artificial showers generated with
lasers from the ground. Mini-EUSO can map the night-time Earth in the UV range
(290 - 430 nm), with a spatial resolution of about 6.3 km and a temporal
resolution of 2.5 $\mu$s, observing our planet through a nadir-facing
UV-transparent window in the Russian Zvezda module. The instrument, launched on
2019/08/22 from the Baikonur cosmodrome, is based on an optical system
employing two Fresnel lenses and a focal surface composed of 36 Multi-Anode
Photomultiplier tubes, 64 channels each, for a total of 2304 channels with
single photon counting sensitivity and an overall field of view of
44$^{\circ}$. Mini-EUSO also contains two ancillary cameras to complement
measurements in the near infrared and visible ranges. In this paper we describe
the detector and present the various phenomena observed in the first year of
operation.

public transit systems from the supply and demand sides using automated fare
collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL) data. Specifically, on
the supply side, we propose an incident-based network redundancy index to
analyze the network's ability to provide alternative services under a specific
rail disruption. The impacts on operations are analyzed through the headway
changes. On the demand side, the analysis takes place at two levels: aggregate
flows and individual response. We calculate the demand changes of different
rail lines, rail stations, bus routes, and bus stops to better understand the
passenger flow redistribution under incidents. Individual behavior is analyzed
using a binary logit model based on inferred passengers' mode choices and
socio-demographics using AFC data. The public transit system of the Chicago
Transit Authority is used as a case study. Two rail disruption cases are
analyzed, one with high network redundancy around the impacted stations and the
other with low. Results show that the service frequency of the incident line
was largely reduced (by around 30% ~ 70%) during the incident time. Nearby rail
lines with substitutional functions were also slightly affected. Passengers
showed different behavioral responses in the two incident scenarios. In the low
redundancy case, most of the passengers chose to use nearby buses to move,
either to their destinations or to the nearby rail lines. In the high
redundancy case, most of the passengers transferred directly to nearby lines.
Corresponding policy implications and operating suggestions are discussed.

a new revolution in automatic image recognition. This emerging technology
relies on sharing ground truth labeled data between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle

However, such an approach will bring data privacy and data availability
challenges. To address these issues, we first present a Semi-supervised
Federated Learning (SSFL) framework for privacy-preserving UAV image
recognition. Specifically, we propose model parameters mixing strategy to
improve the naive combination of FL and semi-supervised learning methods under
two realistic scenarios (labels-at-client and labels-at-server), which is
referred to as Federated Mixing (FedMix). Furthermore, there are significant
differences in the number, features, and distribution of local data collected
by UAVs using different camera modules in different environments, i.e.,
statistical heterogeneity. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity problem,
we propose an aggregation rule based on the frequency of the client's
participation in training, namely the FedFreq aggregation rule, which can
adjust the weight of the corresponding local model according to its frequency.
Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is
significantly better than those of the current baseline and is robust to

the Earth's atmosphere and dense media such as ice has, historically, been much
debated. This situation changed in the early 2010's, with the community
converging on the common terminology of ""geomagnetic"" and ""Askaryan"" radiation
to describe the two emission mechanisms. However, this convergence arose from
discussions at various conferences and workshops, and was ultimately reached
through agreement between simulation codes and experimental measurements. In
this article therefore, I use relatively simple geometrical arguments, and a
minimum of calculations based on single particle tracks, to explain the nature
of radiation from extensive air showers (EAS) and cascades in dense media such
as ice. I identify well-determined frequency regimes where the radiation from
the Askaryan effect will be bremsstrahlung-like and Cherenkov-like, being
respectively below/above 1 GHz in EAS and 100 MHz in dense media; and where
geomagnetic emission will be transverse-current-like and where it will resemble
synchrotron radiation, respectively below/above a few GHz in EAS, depending on
the height of cascade development. I suggest how these transitions in the
nature of the emission may be experimentally observed.

It facilitates graph representations beneficial to downstream tasks; but its
success could hinge on domain knowledge for handcraft or the often expensive
trials and errors. Even its state-of-the-art representative, graph contrastive
learning (GraphCL), is not completely free of those needs as GraphCL uses a
prefabricated prior reflected by the ad-hoc manual selection of graph data
augmentations. Our work aims at advancing GraphCL by answering the following
questions: How to represent the space of graph augmented views? What principle
can be relied upon to learn a prior in that space? And what framework can be
constructed to learn the prior in tandem with contrastive learning?
Accordingly, we have extended the prefabricated discrete prior in the
augmentation set, to a learnable continuous prior in the parameter space of
graph generators, assuming that graph priors per se, similar to the concept of
image manifolds, can be learned by data generation. Furthermore, to form
contrastive views without collapsing to trivial solutions due to the prior
learnability, we have leveraged both principles of information minimization
(InfoMin) and information bottleneck (InfoBN) to regularize the learned priors.
Eventually, contrastive learning, InfoMin, and InfoBN are incorporated
organically into one framework of bi-level optimization. Our principled and
automated approach has proven to be competitive against the state-of-the-art
graph self-supervision methods, including GraphCL, on benchmarks of small
graphs; and shown even better generalizability on large-scale graphs, without
resorting to human expertise or downstream validation. Our code is publicly

from the kinematical $SU(2)$ (quantum) Hilbert space of the theory of $2+1D$
gravity with non-zero cosmological constant in the Palatini formalism, and
subsequently impose the constraints. We hence show the dynamical emergence of
the $SU_q(2)$ quantum group at the quantum level within the spin-foam

effective representations of $SU_q(2)$ that are recovered for any Wilson loop
evaluated at the $SU(2)$ group element that encodes the discretization of the
space-time curvature induced by the cosmological constant. The extension to the
spin-network basis, and consequently to any transition amplitude between its

reasoning approach may pose undesired constraints for predicting human decision
making due to a limited number (usually 2 or 3) of driver policies it extracts.
The proposed approach is put forward to fill this gap in the literature by
introducing a continuous domain framework that enables an infinite policy

The partitioning into sub-sequences forces unwanted alignments, which we
address with a pre-alignment step using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet

perform an extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets in nearest

interrogation probe such as cosmic ray muon tomography. It is worth noting
recent developments on muon scattering tomography which has emerged as a
prospective noninvasive monitoring method for many applications including spent
nuclear fuel cask monitoring and geotomography. However, it is still very
challenging to measure muon momentum in the field, despite the apparent
benefits, without resorting to large and expensive calorimeters, ring imagers,
or time of flight detectors. Recent efforts at CNL and INFN have developed
large prototypes based on multiple Coulomb scattering coupled with the muon
momentum reconstruction algorithms. While these efforts show promise, no
portable detectors exist that can measure muon momentum in the field. In this
work, we present a new concept for measuring muon momentum using coupled
pressurized gaseous Cherenkov radiators. By carefully selecting the gas
pressure at each radiator we can optimize the muon momentum threshold for which
a muon signal will be detected. This way, a muon passing through the radiators
will only trigger those radiators with momentum threshold less than the actual

our system can then estimate the muon momentum. The primary benefit of such a

deployed in the field separately or in combination with existing tomography

  Introduction, and Conclusion sections",,"10.3390/thermo3010010",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using boundary-layer theory, natural convection heat transfer formulas which
are accurate over a wide range of Rayleigh numbers ($Ra$) were developed in the
1970s and 1980s for vertical and downward-facing plates. A comprehensive
formula for upward-facing plates remained unsolved because they do not form
conventional boundary-layers.
  From the thermodynamic constraints on heat-engine efficiency, the novel
approach presented here derives formulas for natural convection heat transfer
from isothermal plates. The union of four peer-reviewed data-sets spanning
$1<Ra<10^{12}$ has 5.4% root-mean-squared relative error (RMSRE) from the new
upward-facing heat transfer formula.
  Applied to downward-facing plates, this novel approach outperforms the
Schulenberg (1985) formula's 4.6% RMSRE with 3.8% on four peer-reviewed
data-sets spanning $10^6<Ra<10^{12}$.
  The introduction of the harmonic mean as the characteristic-length metric for
vertical and downward-facing plates extends those rectangular plate formulas to
other convex shapes, achieving 3.8% RMSRE on vertical disk convection from
Hassani and Hollands (1987) and 3.2% from Kobus and Wedekind (1995).

  Recommender System",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to recommend suitable items to
users through natural language conversations. For developing effective CRSs, a
major technical issue is how to accurately infer user preference from very
limited conversation context. To address issue, a promising solution is to
incorporate external data for enriching the context information. However, prior
studies mainly focus on designing fusion models tailored for some specific type
of external data, which is not general to model and utilize multi-type external
data.
  To effectively leverage multi-type external data, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine contrastive learning framework to improve data semantic fusion
for CRS. In our approach, we first extract and represent multi-grained semantic
units from different data signals, and then align the associated multi-type
semantic units in a coarse-to-fine way. To implement this framework, we design
both coarse-grained and fine-grained procedures for modeling user preference,
where the former focuses on more general, coarse-grained semantic fusion and
the latter focuses on more specific, fine-grained semantic fusion. Such an
approach can be extended to incorporate more kinds of external data. Extensive
experiments on two public CRS datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of
our approach in both recommendation and conversation tasks.

for unmagnetized plasmas. Here we present fully-kinetic electromagnetic
particle-in-cell simulations to investigate such process in weakly-magnetized
plasmas of the solar corona conditions. The primary mode excited is the
beam-Langmuir (BL) mode via the classical bump-on-tail instability. Other modes
include the whistler (W) mode excited by the electron cyclotron resonance
instability, the generalized Langmuir (GL) waves that include a superluminal
Z-mode component with smaller wave number $k$ and a thermal Langmuir component
with larger $k$, and the fundamental (F) and harmonic (H) branches of plasma
emission. Further simulations of different mass and temperature ratios of
electrons and protons indicate that the GL mode and the two escaping modes (F
and H) correlate positively with the BL mode in intensity, supporting that they
are excited through nonlinear wave-wave coupling processes involving the BL
mode. We suggest that the dominant process is the decay of the primary BL mode.
This is consistent with the standard theory of plasma emission. Yet, the other
possibility of the Z+W$\rightarrow$O--F coalescing process for the F emission
cannot be ruled out completely.

pathogen-containing droplets, especially amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
not all face coverings are equally effective and most experiments evaluating
mask efficacy are very expensive and complex to operate. In this work, a novel,
home-built, low-cost, and accurate metrology to visualize orally-generated
fluid droplets has been developed. The project includes setup optimization,
data collection, data analysis, and applications. The final materials chosen
were quinine-containing tonic water, 397-402 nm wavelength UV tube lights, an
iPhone and tripod, string, and a spray bottle. The experiment took place in a
dark closet with a dark background. During data collection, the test subject
first wets their mouth with an ingestible fluorescent liquid (tonic water) and
speaks, sneezes, or coughs under UV darklight. The fluorescence from the tonic
water droplets generated can be visualized, recorded by an iPhone 8+ camera in
slo-mo (240 fps), and analyzed. The software VLC is used for frame separation
and Fiji/ImageJ is used for image processing and analysis. The dependencies of
oral fluid droplet generation and propagation on different phonics, the
loudness of speech, and the type of expiratory event were studied in detail and
established using the metrology developed. The efficacy of different types of
masks was evaluated and correlated with fabric microstructures. All masks
blocked droplets to varying extent. Masks with smaller-sized pores and thicker
material were found to block the most droplets. This low-cost technique can be
easily constructed at home using materials that total to a cost of less than
$50. Despite the minimal cost, the method is very accurate and the data is
quantifiable.

FTIR and SEM including EDX and elemental mapping. Early 19th century beads made
of lead-potassium glass are the object of the study. Non-uniformly distributed
internal stresses were introduced into the studied glass during bead
manufacturing. Corrosion of 19th century bead glass has been shown to comprise
several mutually connected processes developing in parallel and intensifying
one another. These processes are the depolymerization of glass, the directed
migration of alkali-metal impurities and local glass leaching, and the
nucleation of micro discontinuities followed by the formation of micro cracks
and their gradual growth. In course of time, their cumulative and apparently
synergistic effect results in glass fracturing terminated with bead crumbling
into tiny discoloured particles. All these phenomena are controlled by the
internal stress originated from the bead production process. Thus, the
phenomenon of stressed bead glass corrosion is the process of the internal
stress relaxation in glass through the nucleation and growth of cracks, which
lasts for many decades at room temperature. It is dramatically accelerated when
beads are heat treated. Annealing at 300{\deg}C for 15 min. is sufficient for
artificial ageing of initially intact beads. The corrosion has been observed to
occur in glass even if beads are kept in well-controlled museum environment.
The local thermal-fluctuation mechanism is proposed to account for the
corrosion phenomenon on an atomic scale. The approach based on the
thermal-fluctuation mechanism is applicable to describe degradation and
destruction processes in various solid substances and composite materials under
stress; this approach enables understanding the phenomena of formation and
degradation of nanostructures, e. g., heterostructures with quantum wells or
quantum dots.

microstructuration, magnetically-assisted slip casting (MASC) was conducted
using a setup with 4 degrees of freedom. Among all possible microstructures, a
hybrid design between nacre-like and helicoidal arrangements was selected due
to its ability to tilt and twist the crack path. The hybrid microstructured
specimen fabricated, consisting of aluminum oxide micro platelets in a silicone
matrix, were tested under compression and their mechanical performance
compared. Although nacre-like composites exhibited the highest strength and
toughness, helicoidal hybrids could show some ductility and higher stiffness.
The fabrication strategy proposed here could thus be a simple route to study
more complex microstructures in view of increasing the toughness of
microplatelet reinforced composites.

schema of classification of subject area, we obtained the yearly disciplinary
profiles of a worldwide graph, where on each node sits a country, in the two
time intervals [1980-1988] and [1992-2017], the fall of the Berlin Wall being
the watershed. We analyse the empirical pairwise cross-correlation matrices of
the time series of disciplinary profiles. The contrast with random matrix
theory proves that, beyond measurement noise, the empirical cross-correlation
matrices bring genuine information. Arising from the Shannon theorem as the
least-structured model consistent with the measured pairwise correlations, the
stationary probability distribution of disciplinary profiles can be described
by a Boltzmann distribution related to a generalized $n_d$-dimensional
Heisenberg model. The set of network interactions of the Heisenberg model have
been inferred and to it they have been applied two clusterization methods,
hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. On a geopolitical
plane this allow to obtain a characterization of the worldwide bilateral
interactions based on physical modeling. A simple geopolitical analysis reveals
the consistency of the results obtained and gives a boost to deeper historical
analysis. In order to obtain the optimal set of pairwise interactions we used a
Pseudo-Likelihood approach. We analytically computed the Pseudo-Likelihood and
its gradient. The analytical computations deserve interest in whatever

hyperelastic plates through differential growth. First, starting from the 3D
governing system of a hyperelastic (neo-Hookean) plate, a consistent
finite-strain plate equation system is formulated through a series-expansion
and truncation approach. Based on the plate equation system, the problem of
shape-programming is studied under the stress-free assumption. By equating the
stress components in the plate equations to be zero, the explicit relations
between growth functions and geometrical quantities of the target shape of the
plate are derived. Then, a theoretical scheme of shape-programming is proposed,
which can be used to identify the growth fields corresponding to arbitrary 3D
shapes of the plate. To demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme, some typical
examples are studied. The predicted growth functions in these examples are
adopted in the numerical simulations, from which the target shapes of the plate
can be recovered completely. The scheme of shape-programming proposed in the
current work is applicable for manufacture of intelligent soft devices.
