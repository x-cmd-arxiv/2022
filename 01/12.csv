photoanodes are semiconductors with an extremely high doping density between
10^18-10^21 cm^-3. Such values are obtained from Mott-Schottky plots by
assuming that the measured capacitance is dominated by the capacitance of the
depletion layer formed by the doping density within the photoanode. In this
work, we show that such an assumption is erroneous in many cases because the
injection of electrons from the collecting contact creates a ubiquitous
capacitance step that is very difficult to distinguish from that of the
depletion layer. Based on this reasoning, we derive an analytical resolution
limit that is independent of the assumed active area and surface roughness of
the photoanode, below which doping densities cannot be measured in a
capacitance measurement. We find that the reported doping densities in
literature lie very close to this value and therefore conclude that there is no
credible evidence from capacitance measurements that confirms that bismuth
vanadate and haematite photoanodes contain high doping densities.

The most common hand-tuning process starts from learning 3D ConvNets using
short video clips and then is followed by learning long-term temporal
dependency using lengthy clips, while gradually decaying the learning rate from
high to low as training progresses. The fact that such process comes along with
several heuristic settings motivates the study to seek an optimal ""path"" to
automate the entire training. In this paper, we decompose the path into a
series of training ""states"" and specify the hyper-parameters, e.g., learning
rate and the length of input clips, in each state. The estimation of the knee
point on the performance-epoch curve triggers the transition from one state to
another. We perform dynamic programming over all the candidate states to plan
the optimal permutation of states, i.e., optimization path. Furthermore, we
devise a new 3D ConvNets with a unique design of dual-head classifier to
improve spatial and temporal discrimination. Extensive experiments on seven

jointly learning the frame synthesis in an end-to-end manner, the generated

an innovative automated sports broadcast directing system, called Smart
Director, which aims at mimicking the typical human-in-the-loop broadcasting

Inspired by the so-called ""three-event"" construction of sports broadcast, we

novel components: 1) the Multi-view Event Localization to detect events by
modeling multi-view correlations, 2) the Multi-view Highlight Detection to rank

cross-correlation approach has proven to be efficient at finding atmospheric

shown that retrievals are possible using a direct likelihood evaluation or
likelihood 'mappings'. The unique aspect of high-resolution retrievals is that
the data-processing methods required to remove the stellar and telluric lines
also distort the underlying exoplanet's signal and therefore the forward model
must be pre-processed to match this filtering. This was the key remaining
limitation in our previously published framework. This paper directly addresses
this by introducing a simple and fast model-filtering technique that can
replicate the processing performed by algorithms such as SysRem and PCA. This
enables retrievals to be performed without having to perform expensive
injection and pre-processing steps for every model. We show that we can
reliably constrain quantitative measures of the atmosphere from transmission
spectra including the temperature-pressure profile, relative abundances,
planetary velocities and rotational broadening parameters. Finally, we
demonstrate our framework using UVES transmission spectroscopy of WASP-121b. We
constrain the temperature-pressure profile and relative abundances of Fe, Cr,

$\log_{10}(\chi_{\rm Fe}/\chi_{\rm V})$=3.78$\pm$0.29 and $\log_{10}(\chi_{\rm

solar values, with the exception of Fe/Mg, where the large Mg abundance is
probably explained by the escaping atmosphere of WASP-121b that is not

chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase of dense quark matter and argued why it is a
promising candidate for the interior matter phase of neutron stars. The MDCDW
condensate occurs in the presence of a magnetic field. It is a single-modulated
chiral density wave characterized by two dynamically generated parameters: the
fermion quasiparticle mass $m$ and the condensate spatial modulation $q$. The
lowest Landau level quasiparticle modes in the MDCDW system are asymmetric
about the zero energy, a fact that leads to the topological properties and
anomalous electric transport exhibited by this phase. The topology makes the
MDCDW phase robust against thermal phonon fluctuations, and as such, it does
not display the Landau-Peierls instability, a stapled feature of
single-modulated inhomogeneous chiral condensates in three dimensions. The
topology is also reflected in the presence of the electromagnetic chiral
anomaly in the effective action and in the formation of hybridized propagating
modes known as an axion-polaritons. Taking into account that one of the
axion-polaritons of this quark phase is gapped, we argued how incident
$\gamma$-ray photons can be converted into gapped axion-polaritons in the
interior of a magnetar star in the MDCDW phase leading the star to collapse, a
phenomenon that can serve to explain the so-called missing pulsar problem in

In this paper, we provided a complete calculation of the effective Lagrangian
till the quadratic order that is generic for the Randall-Sundrum model and its
$N$-brane $(N \geq 4)$ extensions. By applying the variation principle to a
specific perturbation field, we derived the equations of motion and orthogonal
conditions for decoupling the graviton. This approach is demonstrated to be
equivalent to the analysis using the linearized Einstein equation. Our
derivation clarifies that in the $N$-brane set up, just one degree of freedom
for the radion field is dynamical, with the other modes eliminated by the gauge
fixings. Thus we can directly generalize the GW stabilization to the $N$-brane
model in a way similar to the RS1 scenario.

channeled along them. Edge domain walls yield the interesting, and potentially
applicable to real devices property of broadband spin waves confinement to the
edges of the structure. Here we investigate through numerical simulations the
propagation of quasi one-dimensional spin waves in triangle-shaped amorphous
YIG ($Y_3Fe_5O_{12}$) micron sized ferromagnets as a function of the angle
aperture. The edge spin waves (ESWs) have been propagated over the corner in
triangles of 2 microns side with a fixed thickness of 85 nm. Parameters such as
superior vertex angle (in the range of 40$^\circ$-75$^\circ$) and applied
magnetic field have been optimized in order to obtain a higher transmission
coefficient of the ESWs over the triangle vertex. We observed that for a
certain aperture angle for which dominated ESW frequency coincides with one of
the localised DW modes, the transmission is maximized near one and the phase
shift drops to $\pi/2$ indicating resonant transmission of ESWs through the
upper corner. We compare the obtained results with existing theoretical models.
These results could contribute to the development of novel basic elements for
spin wave computing.

(OSCM) is defined on a bipartite graph with both vertex sets aligned parallel
to each other and all edges being drawn as straight lines. The task is to find
a permutation of one of the node sets such that the total number of all
edge-edge intersections, called crossings, is minimized. Usually, the degree of
the nodes of one set is limited by some constant k, with the problem then
abbreviated to OSCM-k.
  In this work, we study an online variant of this problem, in which one of the
node sets is already given. The other node set and the incident edges are
revealed iteratively and each node has to be inserted into placeholders, which
we call slots. The goal is again to minimize the number of crossings in the
final graph. Minimizing crossings in an online way is related to the more
empirical field of dynamic graph drawing. Note the slotted OSCM problem makes
instances harder to solve for an online algorithm but in the offline case it is
equivalent to the version without slots.
  We show that the online slotted OSCM-k is not competitive for any k greater
or equal 2 and subsequently limit the graph class to that of 2-regular graphs,
for which we show a lower bound of 4/3 and an upper bound of 5 on the
competitive ratio.

(ALMA data, Gaia, optical/near-IR spectroscopy) and determine stellar and disk
properties, specifically stellar mass (Mstar), average population age, mass
accretion rate (Macc) and disk dust mass (Mdust). a) In L1688 the relations
between Macc and Mstar, Mdust and Mstar, and Macc and Mdust have a roughly
linear trend with slopes 1.8-1.9 for the first two relations and ~1 for the
third, similarly to what found in the other regions. b) When ordered according
to the characteristic age of each region, Macc decreases as 1/t, when corrected
for the different stellar mass content; Mdust follows roughly the same trend
between 0.5 and 5 Myr, but has an increase of a factor ~3 at ages of 2-3 Myr.
We suggest that this could result from an earlier planet formation, followed by
collisional fragmentation that temporarily replenishes the millimeter-size
grain population. c) The dispersion of Macc and Mdust around the best-fitting
relation with Mstar, as well as that of Macc versus Mdust are large: we find
that the dispersions have continuous distributions with a log-normal shape and
similar width (~0.8 dex). The amount of dust observed at ~1 Myr does not appear
to be sufficient to assemble the majority of planetary systems, which suggests
an earlier planetary cores formation. The dust mass traces to a large extent
the disk gas mass evolution. Two properties remain puzzling: the steep
dependence of Macc and Mdust on Mstar and the cause of the large dispersion in
the three relations analyzed in this paper, in particular the one of the Macc
versus Mdust relation.

Startlingly, V2487 Oph shows flares, called `Superflares', with up to 1.10 mag
amplitude, fast rises of under one-minute, always with an initial impulsive
spike followed by a roughly-exponential tail, typically one-hour durations, and
with random event times averaging once-per-day. The typical flare energy $E$ is
over 10$^{38}$ ergs, while the yearly energy budget is 10$^{41}$ ergs. V2487
Oph Superflares obey three relations; the number distribution of flare energies
scales as $E^{-2.34\pm0.35}$, the waiting time from one flare to the next is
proportional to $E$ of the first event, and flare durations scale as
$E^{0.44\pm0.03}$. Scenarios involving gravitational energy and nuclear energy
fail to satisfy the three relations. The magnetic energy scenario, however, can
explain all three relations. This scenario has magnetic field lines above the
disc being twisted and amplified by the motions of their footprints, with
magnetic reconnection releasing energy that comes out as Superflare light. This
exact mechanism is already well known to occur in white light solar flares, in
ordinary M-type flare stars, and in the many Superflare stars observed all
across the H-R diagram. Superflares on Superflare stars have rise times, light
curve shapes and durations that are very similar to those on V2487 Oph. So we

Matter in the form of axions. A magnetic material is monitored searching for
anomalous magnetization oscillations which can be induced by dark matter
axions. To properly devise such instrument one first needs to understand the
features of the searched-for signal, namely the effective rf field of dark
matter axions $B_a$ acting on electronic spins. Once the properties of $B_a$
are defined, the design and test of the apparatus may start. The optimal sample
is a narrow linewidth and high spin-density material such as Yttrium Iron
Garnet (YIG), coupled to a microwave cavity with almost matched linewidth to
collect the signal. The power in the resonator is collected with an antenna and
amplified with a Josephson Parametric amplifier, a quantum-limited device
which, however, adds most of the setup noise. The signal is further amplified
with low noise HEMT and down-converted for storage with an heterodyne receiver.
This work describes how to build such apparatus, with all the experimental
details, the main issues one might face, and some solutions.

attracted computational scientists working on nonintrusive reduced order
modeling. One of the major strengths that DMD possesses is having ground
theoretical roots from the Koopman approximation theory. Indeed, DMD may be
viewed as the data-driven realization of the famous Koopman operator.
Nonetheless, the stable implementation of DMD incurs computing the singular
value decomposition of the input data matrix. This, in turn, makes the process
computationally demanding for high dimensional systems. In order to alleviate
this burden, we develop a framework based on sketching methods, wherein a
sketch of a matrix is simply another matrix which is significantly smaller, but
still sufficiently approximates the original system. Such sketching or
embedding is performed by applying random transformations, with certain
properties, on the input matrix to yield a compressed version of the initial
system. Hence, many of the expensive computations can be carried out on the
smaller matrix, thereby accelerating the solution of the original problem. We
conduct numerical experiments conducted using the spherical shallow water
equations as a prototypical model in the context of geophysical flows. The
performance of several sketching approaches is evaluated for capturing the
range and co-range of the data matrix. The proposed sketching-based framework
can accelerate various portions of the DMD algorithm, compared to classical
methods that operate directly on the raw input data. This eventually leads to
substantial computational gains that are vital for digital twinning of high
dimensional systems.

$R=\bigoplus_{g\in G} R_g$ graded by a group $G$ such that the base ring $R_1$
has UGN, we investigate conditions under which $R$ must also have UGN. We say
that the grading is \emph{full} if $R_g\neq 0$ for every $g\in G$. Moreover,
the grading is called \emph{free} (respectively, \emph{projective}) if all the
$R_g$ are finitely generated free (respectively, projective) right
$R_1$-modules or finitely generated free (respectively, projective) left

  Our main result, Theorem A, is that a group $G$ is amenable if and only if
every freely and fully $G$-graded ring $R$ has UGN whenever $R_1$ has UGN. We
also prove that, if $G$ is a supramenable group, then every freely $G$-graded

  Neither Theorem A nor Theorem B can be generalized from free to projectively
graded rings. In fact, we show that, if $G$ is an elementary amenable group,
then the following two statements are equivalent: (1) every projectively
$G$-graded ring $R$ has UGN whenever $R_1$ has UGN; (2) $G$ is locally finite.
  Finally, we consider rings that do not have UGN; these are said to have {\it
bounded generating number} (BGN). For a ring $R$ with BGN, the smallest
positive integer $n$ such that there is an $R$-module epimorphism $R^n\to

If $R$ has UGN, then we define ${\rm gn}(R):=\aleph_0$. We describe several
classes of examples of a ring $R$ graded by a supramenable group $G$ such that

observations of protoplanetary disks hint at wide-spread depletion of gaseous
carbon. The missing volatile carbon is likely frozen in CO and/or CO$_2$ ice on
grains and locked into the disk through pebble trapping in pressure bumps or
planetesimals. We present the results of the first successful ACA (Atacama
Compact Array) [C I] $J$ = 1-0 mini-survey of seven protoplanetary disks. Using
tailored azimuthally symmetric DALI (Dust And LInes) thermo-chemical disk
models, supported by the [C I] $J$ = 1-0 and resolved CO isotopologue data, we
determine the system-averaged elemental volatile carbon abundance in the outer
disk of three sources. Six out of seven sources are detected in [C I] $J$ = 1-0
with ACA, four of which show a distinct disk component. Based on the modeling
we find severe cold gaseous carbon depletion in the outer disk of DL Tau and
moderate depletion in the outer disks of DR Tau and DO Tau. Combining the outer
and inner disk carbon abundances, we demonstrate definitive evidence for radial
drift in the disk of DL Tau, where the existence of multiple dust rings points
to either short lived or leaky dust traps. We find dust locking in the compact
and smooth disks of DO Tau and DR Tau, hinting at unresolved dust substructure.
Comparing our results with stars of different ages and luminosities, we
identify an observational evolutionary trend in gaseous carbon depletion that
is consistent with dynamical models of CO depletion processes. Transport
efficiency of solids in protoplanetary disks can significantly differ from what
we expect based on the current resolved substructure in the continuum
observations. This has important implications for our understanding of the
impact of radial drift and pebble accretion on planetary compositions.

realize such varying rates through ignoring domain boundaries during unbinding

by combining recent experimental data with theoretical predictions that capture
the subtleties of nonlinear elasticity and fluid transport. We show that within
a biologically accessible range of material parameters, phase separation is
highly sensitive to elastic properties and can thus be used as a mechanical
switch to rapidly transition between different states in cellular systems.
Furthermore, we show that this active mechanically mediated mechanism can drive
transport across cells at biologically relevant timescales and could play a
crucial role in promoting spatial localization of condensates; whether cells
exploit such mechanisms for transport of their constituents, remains an open

crystallographic structures in the PDB into hierarchies of progressive
interactions involving identical or very similar protein chains, yielding 40205
hierarchies of complexes with increasing numbers of partners. We then examine
them as proxies for the assembly pathways. Using this database, we show that
upon oligomerisation, new interfaces tend to be observed at residues that were
characterised as softly disordered (flexible, amorphous or missing residues) in
the complexes preceding them in the hierarchy. We also rule out the possibility
that this correlation is just a surface effect by restricting the analysis to
residues on the surface. Interestingly, we find that the location of soft
disordered residues in the sequence changes as the number of partners
increases. Our results show that there is a general mechanism for protein
assembly that involves soft disorder and modulates the way protein complexes
are assembled. This work highlights the difficulty of predicting the structure
of large protein complexes from sequence and emphasises the importance of
linking predictors of disorder to the next generation of predictors of complex

states emerges at late times, whose dynamics relies on a complex interplay
between hydrodynamic interactions and multibody collisions among internal
drops. In this work, we use lattice Boltzmann simulations to study the dynamics
of polydisperse double emulsions driven by a Poiseuille flow within a

affected by multiple factors, such as initial position, polydispersity index,
and area fraction occupied within the emulsion. While at low area fraction
inner drops may exhibit either a periodic rotational motion (at low
polydispersity) or arrange into nonmotile configurations (at high
polydispersity) located far from each other, at larger values of area fraction
they remain in tight contact and move unidirectionally. This decisively
conditions their close-range dynamics, quantitatively assessed through a
time-efficiency-like factor. Simulations also unveil the key role played by the
capsule, whose shape changes can favor the formation of a selected number of
nonequilibrium states in which both motile and nonmotile configurations are

remain poorly explored. Here we present ALMA observations of V605 Aql that
unveil for the first time the spatio-kinematic distribution of the molecular
material associated to a born-again star. Both the continuum and molecular line
emission exhibit a clumpy ring-like structure with a total extent of
$\approx$1$^{\prime\prime}$ in diameter. The bulk of the molecular emission is
interpreted as being produced in a radially-expanding disk-like structure with
an expansion velocity v$_{\rm exp}$$\sim$90 km s$^{-1}$ and an inclination
$i$$\approx$60$^{\circ}$ with respect to the line-of-sight. The observations
also reveal a compact high-velocity component, v$_{\rm exp}$$\sim$280 km
s$^{-1}$, that is aligned perpendicularly to the expanding disk. This component
is interpreted as a bipolar outflow with a kinematical age $\tau$$\lesssim$20
yr, which could either be material that is currently being ejected from V605
Aql, or it is being dragged from the inner parts of the disk by a stellar wind.
The dust mass of the disk is in the range $M_{\rm
dust}$$\sim$0.2-8$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$, depending on the dust
absorption coefficient. The mass of the CO is $M_{\rm
CO}$$\approx$1.1$\times10^{-5}$ $M_{\odot}$, which is more than three orders of
magnitude larger than the mass of the other detected molecules. We estimate a
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of 5.6$\pm$0.6, which is consistent with the single
stellar evolution scenario in which the star experienced a very late thermal
pulse instead of a nova-like event as previously suggested.

novel techniques called delayed marginalization and pose graph bundle
adjustment. DM-VIO performs photometric bundle adjustment with a dynamic weight
for visual residuals. We adopt marginalization, which is a popular strategy to
keep the update time constrained, but it cannot easily be reversed, and
linearization points of connected variables have to be fixed. To overcome this
we propose delayed marginalization: The idea is to maintain a second factor
graph, where marginalization is delayed. This allows us to later readvance this
delayed graph, yielding an updated marginalization prior with new and
consistent linearization points. In addition, delayed marginalization enables
us to inject IMU information into already marginalized states. This is the
foundation of the proposed pose graph bundle adjustment, which we use for IMU
initialization. In contrast to prior works on IMU initialization, it is able to
capture the full photometric uncertainty, improving the scale estimation. In
order to cope with initially unobservable scale, we continue to optimize scale
and gravity direction in the main system after IMU initialization is complete.
We evaluate our system on the EuRoC, TUM-VI, and 4Seasons datasets, which
comprise flying drone, large-scale handheld, and automotive scenarios. Thanks
to the proposed IMU initialization, our system exceeds the state of the art in
visual-inertial odometry, even outperforming stereo-inertial methods while
using only a single camera and IMU. The code will be published at

group defense of a resource in a consumer-resource interaction. Furthermore,
time lags in the population caused by discrete reproductive pulses have the
potential to produce long transients, either independently or in conjunction to
the transients caused by the group defense. In this work, we analyze the
potential for long transients in a model for a consumer-resource system in
which the resource exhibits group defense and reproduces in discrete
reproductive pulses. We develop this discrete-time model by discretizing a
pulse differential equation. This system exhibits crawl-by transients near the
extinction and carrying capacity states of resource. In addition, we identify a
transcritical bifurcation in our system, under which a ghost limit cycle
appears. These transients resemble stable states for a prolonged transient time

multi-task optimization algorithms have instead been proposed, inspired by
various hypotheses about what makes multi-task settings difficult. The majority
of these optimizers require per-task gradients, and introduce significant
memory, runtime, and implementation overhead. We show that unitary
scalarization, coupled with standard regularization and stabilization
techniques from single-task learning, matches or improves upon the performance
of complex multi-task optimizers in popular supervised and reinforcement
learning settings. We then present an analysis suggesting that many specialized
multi-task optimizers can be partly interpreted as forms of regularization,
potentially explaining our surprising results. We believe our results call for
a critical reevaluation of recent research in the area.

variety of 3D virtual humans with varied identities and shapes in arbitrary

their complex articulations, and the resulting rich, yet stochastic geometric
detail in clothing. Hence, current methods to represent 3D people do not
provide a full generative model of people in clothing. In this paper, we
propose a novel method that learns to generate detailed 3D shapes of people in
a variety of garments with corresponding skinning weights. Specifically, we
devise a multi-subject forward skinning module that is learned from only a few
posed, un-rigged scans per subject. To capture the stochastic nature of
high-frequency details in garments, we leverage an adversarial loss formulation
that encourages the model to capture the underlying statistics. We provide
empirical evidence that this leads to realistic generation of local details
such as wrinkles. We show that our model is able to generate natural human
avatars wearing diverse and detailed clothing. Furthermore, we show that our
method can be used on the task of fitting human models to raw scans,
outperforming the previous state-of-the-art.

robotics tasks, including resource allocation, interference coordination, and
mission planning. Although numerous techniques have been proposed to construct
radio maps from spatially distributed measurements, the locations of such
measurements are assumed predetermined beforehand. In contrast, this paper
proposes spectrum surveying, where a mobile robot such as an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) collects measurements at a set of locations that are actively
selected to obtain high-quality map estimates in a short surveying time. This
is performed in two steps. First, two novel algorithms, a model-based online
Bayesian estimator and a data-driven deep learning algorithm, are devised for
updating a map estimate and an uncertainty metric that indicates the
informativeness of measurements at each possible location. These algorithms
offer complementary benefits and feature constant complexity per measurement.
Second, the uncertainty metric is used to plan the trajectory of the UAV to
gather measurements at the most informative locations. To overcome the
combinatorial complexity of this problem, a dynamic programming approach is
proposed to obtain lists of waypoints through areas of large uncertainty in
linear time. Numerical experiments conducted on a realistic dataset confirm
that the proposed scheme constructs accurate radio maps quickly.

out the possibility that $T_c$ in superconductors can be enhanced via
effectively decreased electron-electron repulsion through nonlinear
electron-phonon coupling in a cavity. We further find that upon driving the
cavity, electronic interactions decrease. Two different regimes emerge: (i) a
strong coupling regime where the phonons show a delayed response at a time
proportional to the inverse coupling strength, and (ii) an ultra-strong
coupling regime where the response is immediate when driving the phonon
polaritons resonantly. We further identify a distinctive feature in the
electronic spectral function when electrons couple to phonon polaritons
involving an infrared-active phonon mode, namely the splitting of the shake-off

migrate to different orbits due to interactions with non-axisymmetric
disturbances within the disc such as bars or spiral arms. This paper extends
the study of migration to examine the role of external influences using the
example of the interaction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) with the Milky
Way (MW). We first make impulse approximation estimates to characterize the
influence of Sgr disc passages. The tidal forcing from Sgr can produce changes
in both guiding radius ($\Delta R_g$) and orbital eccentricity, as quantified
by the maximum radial excursion, $\Delta R_ {\rm max} $. These changes follow a
quadrupole-like pattern across the face of the disc, with amplitude increasing
with Galactocentric radius. We next examine a collisionless N-body simulation
of a Sgr-like satellite interacting with a MW-like galaxy and find that Sgr's
influence in the outer disc dominates over the secular evolution of orbits
between disc passages. Finally, we use the same simulation to explore possible
observable signatures of Sgr-induced migration by painting the simulation with
different age stellar populations. We find that following Sgr disc passages,
the migration it induces manifests within an annulus as an approximate
quadrupole in azimuthal metallicity variations ($\delta_ {\rm [Fe/H]} $), along
with systematic variations in orbital eccentricity, $\Delta R_ {\rm max} $.
These systematic variations can persist for several rotational periods. We
conclude that this combination of signatures may be used to distinguish between
the different migration mechanisms shaping the chemical abundance patterns of
the Milky Way's thin disc.

we also find no significant differences in the accretion properties. We detect
ionized outflows in a number of red and blue quasars, but do not find any

currently known, while \planet is conversely one of the highest. All three

use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to re-simulate the region at higher
resolution (1 M$_\odot$ per particle). We present a method for momentum-driven
stellar winds from main sequence massive stars, and include this with
photoionization, self-gravity, a galactic potential, and ISM heating/cooling.
We also include cluster-sink particles with accretion radii of 0.78 pc to track
star/cluster formation. The feedback methods are as robust as previous models
on individual cloud scales (e.g. Dale et al.). We find that photoionization
dominates the disruption of the spiral arm section, with stellar winds only
producing small cavities (at most $\sim$ 30 pc). Stellar winds do not affect
the resulting cloud statistics or the integrated star formation
rate/efficiency, unlike ionization, which produces more stars, and more clouds
of higher density and higher velocity dispersion compared to the control run
without feedback. Winds do affect the sink properties, distributing star
formation over more low-mass sinks ($\sim 10^2$ M$_\odot$) and producing fewer
high-mass sinks ($\sim 10^3$ M$_\odot$). Overall, stellar winds play at best a
secondary role compared to photoionization, and on many measures, they have a
negligible impact.

idealized analysis to forecast statistical uncertainties on a limited set of
cosmological and physically-motivated astrophysical parameters. We find that
the electron number density auto-correlation, measurable through either
kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations or through Fast Radio Burst
dispersion measures, provides tight constraints on $\Omega_{m}$ and the mean
baryon fraction in intermediate-mass halos, $\bar{f}_{\mathrm{bar}}$. By
obtaining an empirical measure for the associated systematic uncertainties, we
find these constraints to be largely robust to differences in baryonic feedback
models implemented in hydrodynamic simulations. We further discuss the main

convex region of the potential during the post-inflationary oscillating phase.
This will induce a strong tachyonic instability and lead to a rapid
fragmentation of the coherent field that can complete within a fraction of an
$e$-fold. In this paper, we study the linear regime of this process in a
model-independent way. To this purpose, we construct simplified models that
provide an analytic Floquet theoretic description of mode growth. This approach
captures the essential features of well-motivated tachyonic preheating
scenarios, including scenarios in which the inflaton is part of a larger scalar

consistent with any experimentally allowed tensor-to-scalar ratio.

orbiting a slightly evolved G5 host star. This planet transited only once in
Cycle 2 of the primary Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.
Citizen scientists identified the 24 hr single-transit event shortly after the
data were released, allowing a Doppler monitoring campaign with the Automated
Planet Finder telescope at Lick Observatory to begin promptly. The radial
velocity observations refined the orbital period of TOI-2180 b to be
260.8$\pm$0.6 days, revealed an orbital eccentricity of 0.368$\pm$0.007, and
discovered long-term acceleration from a more distant massive companion. We
conducted ground-based photometry from 14 sites spread around the globe in an
attempt to detect another transit. Although we did not make a clear transit
detection, the nondetections improved the precision of the orbital period. We
predict that TESS will likely detect another transit of TOI-2180 b in Sector 48
of its extended mission. We use giant planet structure models to retrieve the
bulk heavy-element content of TOI-2180 b. When considered alongside other giant
planets with orbital periods over 100 days, we find tentative evidence that the
correlation between planet mass and metal enrichment relative to stellar is
dependent on orbital properties. Single-transit discoveries like TOI-2180 b
highlight the exciting potential of the TESS mission to find planets with long
orbital periods and low irradiation fluxes despite the selection biases
associated with the transit method.

pairing at the Van Hove point, and obtain a quantitative estimate of the
entropy change associated with entry to a magnetic state that is observed in

extending over several scale lengths, both in mass and star-formation rate, but
the physical origin is not well understood. We explore a physical model in
which the galactic gas disk is viewed as a ""modified accretion disk"" in which
coplanar gas inflow, driven by viscous stresses in the disk, provides the fuel
for star formation, which progressively removes gas as it flows inwards. We
show that magnetic stresses from magneto-rotational instability are the most
plausible source of the required viscosity, and construct a simple physical
model to explore this. A key feature is to link the magnetic field strength to
the local star-formation surface density, $B_{\rm tot} \propto \Sigma_{\rm
SFR}^\alpha$. This provides a feed-back loop between star-formation and the
flow of gas. We find that the model naturally produces stable steady-state
exponential disks, as long as $\alpha \sim$ 0.15, the value indicated from
spatially-resolved observations of nearby galaxies. The disk scale-length
$h_{\rm R}$ is set by the rate at which the disk is fed, by the normalization
of the $B_{\rm tot}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation and by the circular velocity of
the halo. The angular momentum distribution of the gas and stars within the
disk is a consequence of the transfer of angular momentum that is inherent to
the operation of an accretion disk, rather than the initial angular momentum of
the inflowing material. We suggest that magnetic stresses likely play a major
role in establishing the stable exponential form of galactic disks.

galactic nuclei (AGN) have in regulating star formation in their host galaxies.
Although the presence of outflows in AGN host galaxies has been firmly
established, the calculation of outflow properties such as mass outflow rates
and kinetic energy remains challenging. We present the [OIII]5007 ionised gas
outflow properties of 22 z$<$0.1 X-ray AGN, derived from the BAT AGN
Spectroscopic Survey using MUSE/VLT. With an average spatial resolution of 1""
(0.1-1.2 kpc), the observations resolve the ionised gas clouds down to
sub-kiloparsec scales. Resolved maps show that the [OIII] velocity dispersion
is, on average, higher in regions ionised by the AGN, compared to star
formation. We calculate the instantaneous outflow rates in individual MUSE
spaxels by constructing resolved mass outflow rate maps, incorporating variable
outflow density and velocity. We compare the instantaneous values with
time-averaged outflow rates by placing mock fibres and slits on the MUSE
field-of-view, a method often used in the literature. The instantaneous outflow
rates (0.2-275 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) tend to be 2 orders of magnitude higher
than the time-averaged outflow rates (0.001-40 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The
outflow rates correlate with the AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}\sim$
10$^{42.71}$-10$^{45.62}$ erg/s) but we find no correlations with black hole
mass (10$^{6.1}$-10$^{8.9}$ M$_{\odot}$), Eddington ratio (0.002-1.1) and radio
luminosity (10$^{21}$-10$^{26}$ W/Hz). We find the median coupling between the
kinetic energy and $L_{\rm bol}$ to be 1%, consistent with the theoretical
predictions for an AGN-driven outflow.

found that in many dynamical regimes the IM of an infinite system has low
temporal entanglement and can be efficiently represented as a matrix-product

entangled intermediate states - a temporal entanglement barrier (TEB). We argue
that TEB is ubiquitous, and elucidate its physical origin via a semiclassical
quasiparticle picture that exactly captures the behavior of integrable spin
chains. Further, we show that a TEB also arises in chaotic spin chains, which
lack well-defined quasiparticles. Based on these insights, we formulate an
alternative light-cone growth algorithm, which provably avoids TEB, thus
providing an efficient construction of the thermodynamic-limit IM as a MPS.
This work uncovers the origin of the efficiency of the IM approach for
thermalization and transport.

almost co-planar and co-rotating with the gas disk, and that the outflow of gas
driven by stellar winds and/or supernova explosions is preferentially
perpendicular to the disk. This indicates that the galactic gas disk can be
treated as a modified accretion disk. In this work, we focus on the metal
enhancement in galactic disks in this scenario of gas accretion. Assuming that
the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) is of exponential
form, we obtain the analytic solution of gas-phase metallicity with only three
free parameters: the scalelength of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ ($h_{\rm R}$), the
metallicity of the inflowing gas and the mass-loading factor defined as the
wind-driven outflow rate surface density per $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. According to
this simple model, the negative gradient of gas-phase metallicity is a natural
consequence of the radial inflow of cold gas which is continuously enriched by
in-situ star formation as it moves towards the disk center. We fit the model to
the observed metallicity profiles for six nearby galaxies chosen to have
well-measured metallicity profiles extending to very large radii. Our model can
well characterize the overall features of the observed metallicity profiles.
The observed profiles usually show a floor at the outer regions of the disk,
corresponding to the metallicity of inflow gas. Furthermore, we find the
$h_{\rm R}$ of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ inferred from these fits agree well with
independent estimates from $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ profiles, supporting the basic
model.

we apply high-resolution transmission spectroscopy using the PEPSI spectrograph
on the Large Binocular Telescope to study the atmosphere of KELT-9 b, an
ultra-hot Jupiter and currently the hottest known planet. We measure $\sim$10
km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ day-to-nightside winds traced by Fe II features in the
planet's atmosphere. This is at odds with previous literature (including data
taken with PEPSI), which report no significant day-to-nightside winds on KELT-9
b. We identify the cause of this discrepancy as due to an inaccurate ephemeris
for KELT-9 b in previous literature. We update the ephemeris, which shifts the
mid-transit time by up to 10 minutes for previous datasets, resulting in
consistent detections of blueshifts in all the datasets analyzed here.
Furthermore, a comparison with archival HARPS-N datasets suggests temporal wind
variability $\sim$5-8 km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ over timescales between weeks to
years. Temporal variability of atmospheric dynamics on hot Jupiters is a
phenomenon anticipated by certain general circulation models that has not been
observed over these timescales until now. However, such large variability as we
measure on KELT-9 b challenges general circulation models, which predict much
lower amplitudes of wind variability over timescales between days to weeks.

becoming clear that they can also strongly affect the interstellar medium (ISM)
inside the host galaxy. Particularly important is the initial phase ($<10^6$
yr) of the evolution of the radio jet, when they expand into the inner few kpc
of the host galaxy. Here we report on results obtained for a representative
group of young radio galaxies using the cold molecular gas as a tracer of
jet-ISM interactions. The sensitivity and high spatial resolution of ALMA and
NOEMA are ideal to study the details of this process. In many objects we find
massive molecular outflows driven by the plasma jet, even in low-power radio
sources. However, the observed outflows are limited to the circumnuclear
regions and only a small fraction of the ISM is leaving the galaxy. Beyond this
region, the impact of the jet seems to change. Fast outflows are replaced by a
milder expansion driven by the expanding cocoon created by the jet-ISM
interaction, resulting in dispersing and heating the ISM. These findings are in
line with predictions from simulations of jets interacting with a clumpy medium

making a general overview of the theory of holomorphic systems, we classify all

$\dot{z}=f(z)$ and $\dot{z}=1/f(z)$, where $f(z)$ is a polynomial of degree
$2$, $3$ and $4$ in the variable $z\in \mathbb{C}$. We also classify all the

expressions of first integrals of holomorphic systems and of conjugated
holomorphic systems, which have important applications in the study of fluid
dynamics.

number generators and high-speed polarization measurements, we space-like
separate all relevant events to ensure independent state preparations and
measurements, and close locality loopholes simultaneously. Our results violate
the real number bound of 7.66 by 5.30 standard deviations, hence rejecting the

uncertainty by helping system operators ensure a reliable and secure power
grid. This paper studies a short-term condition-based integrated maintenance
planning with operations scheduling problem while considering the unexpected
failure possibilities of generators as well as transmission lines. We formulate
this problem as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program with failure
scenarios sampled from the sensor-driven remaining lifetime distributions of
the individual system elements whereas a joint chance-constraint consisting of
Poisson Binomial random variables is introduced to account for failure risks.
Because of its intractability, we develop a cutting-plane method to obtain an
exact reformulation of the joint chance-constraint by proposing a separation
subroutine and deriving stronger cuts as part of this procedure. To solve
large-scale instances, we derive a second-order cone programming based safe
approximation of this constraint. Furthermore, we propose a decomposition-based
algorithm implemented in parallel fashion for solving the resulting stochastic
program, by exploiting the features of the integer L-shaped method and the
special structure of the maintenance and operations scheduling problem to
derive stronger optimality cuts. We further present preprocessing steps over
transmission line flow constraints to identify redundancies. To illustrate the
computational performance and efficiency of our algorithm compared to more
conventional maintenance approaches, we design a computational study focusing
on a weekly plan with daily maintenance and hourly operational decisions
involving detailed unit commitment subproblems. Our computational results on
various IEEE instances demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed
approach with reliable and cost-effective maintenance and operational

enhanced emission at the polar caps and equatorial torus for low ionization
lines, and enhanced high ionization emission lines only at the polar caps. The
radial velocities are compatible with a homogeneous expansion velocity of v=590
km s$^{-1}$ and a system inclination angle of 24$^o$. These values were used to
estimate an expansion parallax distance of 1200 $\pm$ 400 pc. The NIRC2 data
indicate the presence of dust in 2016 and 2017, but no dust emission could be
detected in 2019. The observational data were used for assembling 3D
photoionization models of the ejecta. The model results indicate that the
central source has a temperature of $1.88\times10^{5}$ K and a luminosity of
$1.6\times10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in August of 2017 (2.4 years post eruption),
and that the shell has a mass of $6.3\times10^{-5}$ M$_{\odot}$. The models
also suggest an anisotropy of the ionizing flux, possibly by the contribution
from a luminous accretion disc.

capture and dispose of large space debris in orbit. This tether-net system is
subject to several sources of uncertainty in sensing and actuation that affect
the performance of its net launch and closing control. Earlier
reliability-based optimization approaches to design control actions however
remain challenging and computationally prohibitive to generalize over varying
launch scenarios and target (debris) state relative to the chaser. To search
for a general and reliable control policy, this paper presents a reinforcement
learning framework that integrates a proximal policy optimization (PPO2)
approach with net dynamics simulations. The latter allows evaluating the
episodes of net-based target capture, and estimate the capture quality index
that serves as the reward feedback to PPO2. Here, the learned policy is
designed to model the timing of the net closing action based on the state of
the moving net and the target, under any given launch scenario. A stochastic
state transition model is considered in order to incorporate synthetic
uncertainties in state estimation and launch actuation. Along with notable
reward improvement during training, the trained policy demonstrates capture
performance (over a wide range of launch/target scenarios) that is close to
that obtained with reliability-based optimization run over an individual
scenario.

satisfactory decisions is a fundamental problem in studying collective
behaviors. In the framework of evolutionary game theory and by means of
potential functions, researchers have established equilibrium convergence under
different update rules, including best-response and imitation, by imposing
certain conditions on agents' utility functions. Then by using the proposed
potential functions, they have been able to control these populations towards
some desired equilibrium. Nevertheless, finding a potential function is often
daunting, if not near impossible. We introduce the so-called coordinating agent
who tends to switch to a decision only if at least another agent has done so.
We prove that any population of coordinating agents, a coordinating population,
almost surely equilibrates. Apparently, some binary network games that were
proven to equilibrate using potential functions are coordinating, and some
coloring problems can be solved using this notion. We additionally show that
any mixed network of agents following best-response, imitation, or rational
imitation, and associated with coordination payoff matrices is coordinating,
and hence, equilibrates. As a second contribution, we provide an
incentive-based control algorithm that leads coordinating populations to a
desired equilibrium. The algorithm iteratively maximizes the ratio of the
number of agents choosing the desired decision to the provided incentive. It
performs near optimal and as well as specialized algorithms proposed for
best-response and imitation; however, it does not require a potential function.
Therefore, this control algorithm can be readily applied in general situations
where no potential function is yet found for a given decision-making
population.

function that measures the deviation of the fiber cross section relative to a
twist-free frame, the fiber exerts only torque parallel to the centerline on
the fluid, and the perpendicular components of the rotational fluid velocity
are discarded in favor of the translational velocity. In the first part of this
paper, we justify this model by comparing it to another commonly-used

to be consistent with the translational fluid velocity. We then develop a
spectral numerical method for the hydrodynamics of the Euler model. We define
hydrodynamic mobility operators using integrals of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa

which requires on the order of 10 points along the fiber to obtain several
digits of accuracy. We demonstrate that this choice of mobility removes the
unphysical negative eigenvalues in the translation-translation mobility
associated with asymptotic slender body theories, and ensures strong
convergence of the fiber velocity and weak convergence of the fiber constraint
forces. We pair the spatial discretization with a semi-implicit temporal
integrator to confirm the negligible contribution of twist elasticity to the

hypothesized that there could also be a parity-conjugated copy of the standard
model particles, called mirror particles. The existence of such a mirror
universe has specific testable implications, especially in the domain of
neutral particle oscillation, viz. the baryon number violating neutron to
mirror-neutron ($n-n'$) oscillation. Consequently, there were many experiments
that have searched for $n-n'$ oscillation, and imposed constraints upon the
parameters that describe it. All the previous efforts searched for $n-n'$
oscillation by comparing the relative number of ultracold neutrons that survive
after a period of storage for one or both of the two cases: (i) comparison of
zero applied magnetic field to a non-zero applied magnetic field, and (ii)
comparison where the orientation of the applied magnetic field was reversed.
However, $n-n'$ oscillations also lead to variations in the precession
frequency of polarized neutrons upon flipping the direction of the applied
magnetic field. For the first time, we used the data from the latest search for
the neutron electric dipole moment [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 081803 (2020)] to
constrain $n-n'$ oscillation. After compensating for the systematic effects
that affect the ratio of precession frequencies of ultracold neutrons and
cohabiting $^{199}$Hg-atoms, chief among which was due to their motion in
non-uniform magnetic field, we constrained any further perturbations due to
$n-n'$ oscillation. We thereby provide a lower limit on the $n-n'$ oscillation
time constant of $\tau_{nn'}/\sqrt{|\cos(\beta)|} > 5.7~$s,
$0.36~\mu$T'$<B'<1.01~\mu$T' (95\% C.L.), where $\beta$ is the angle between
the applied magnetic field and the ambient mirror magnetic field. This
constraint is the best available in the range of $0.36~\mu$T'$<B'<0.40~\mu$T'.

properly modelling deviations from sphericity due to shear and rotation induced

delay-sensitivity. These applications are invoked heavily with similar inputs

realized by offloading prevalent services to the edge and thus minimizing
communication in the core network and eliminating redundant computations using
the computation reuse concept. In this paper, we present matching-based
services offloading schemes for compute-less IoT networks. We adopt the
matching theory to match service offloading to the appropriate edge server(s).
Specifically, we design, WHISTLE, a vertical many-to-many offloading scheme

appropriate edge servers. We further extend WHISTLE to provide horizontal
one-to-many computation reuse sharing among edge servers which leads to
bouncing less computation back to the cloud. We evaluate the efficiency and

(5.25 \rearth{}, 23.6 \mearth{}) with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field
Camera 3 instrument. TOI-674 b is in the Neptune desert, an observed paucity of
Neptune-size exoplanets at short orbital periods. Planets in the desert are
thought to have complex evolutionary histories due to photoevaporative mass
loss or orbital migration, making identifying the constituents of their
atmospheres critical to understanding their origins. We obtained near-infrared
transmission spectroscopy of the planet's atmosphere with the G141 grism. After
extracting, detrending, and fitting the spectral lightcurves to measure the
planet's transmission spectrum, we used the petitRADTRANS atmospheric spectral
synthesis code to perform retrievals on the planet's atmosphere to identify
which absorbers are present. These results show moderate evidence for increased
absorption at 1.4 $\mu$m due to water vapor at 2.9$\sigma$ (Bayes factor =
15.8), as well as weak evidence for the presence of clouds at 2.2$\sigma$
(Bayes factor = 4.0). TOI-674 b is a strong candidate for further study to
refine the water abundance, which is poorly constrained by our data. We also
incorporated new TESS short-cadence optical photometry, as well as Spitzer/IRAC
data, and re-fit the transit parameters for the planet. We find the planet to
have the following transit parameters: $R_p/R_* = 0.1135\pm0.0006$, $T_0 =
2458544.523792\pm0.000452$ BJD, and $P = 1.977198\pm0.00007$ d. These
measurements refine the planet radius estimate and improve the orbital
ephemerides for future transit spectroscopy observations of this highly
intriguing warm Neptune.

  information",,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Recent theory shows that extortioners taking advantage of the
zero-determinant (ZD) strategy can unilaterally claim an unfair share of the
payoffs in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. It is thus suggested that against a
fixed extortioner, any adapting co-player should be subdued with full
cooperation as their best response. In contrast, recent experiments demonstrate
that human players often choose not to accede to extortion out of concern for
fairness, actually causing extortioners to suffer more loss than themselves. In
light of this, here we reveal fair-minded strategies that are unbending to
extortion such that any payoff-maximizing extortioner ultimately will concede
in their own interest by offering a fair split in head-to-head matches. We find
and characterize multiple general classes of such unbending strategies,
including generous zero-determinant strategies and Win-Stay, Lose-Shift as
particular examples. When against fixed unbending players, extortioners are
forced with consequentially increasing losses whenever intending to demand more
unfair share. Our analysis also pivots to the importance of payoff structure in
determining the superiority of zero-determinant strategies and in particular
their extortion ability. We show that an extortionate ZD player can be even
outperformed by, for example, Win-Stay Lose-Shift, if the total payoff of
unilateral cooperation is smaller than that of mutual defection. Unbending
strategies can be used to outlearn evolutionary extortioners and catalyze the
evolution of Tit-for-Tat-like strategies out of ZD players. Our work has
implications for promoting fairness and resisting extortion so as to uphold a
just and cooperative society.

in the collision layer. The present paper centers around the initial phase of
the interpenetration of the two plasmas. A two-stream ion-ion instability,
efficient electron heating, and stochastic acceleration dominate plasma mixing
at this phase. Both the adiabatic (reversible) electron heating and stochastic

productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most profoundly, a better
understanding of our own minds.
  But not all types of AI are human-like. In fact, many of the most powerful
systems are very different from humans. So an excessive focus on developing and
deploying HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes
for human labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and
become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast,
when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, then humans
retain the power to insist on a share of the value created. Furthermore,
augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services, ultimately
generating far more value than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can
be enormously beneficial, there are currently excess incentives for automation

component of their interstellar medium due to ram pressure stripping,
contributing to the observed quenching of star formation in the disk compared
to galaxies in lower density environments. However, the short term effects of
ram pressure on the star formation rate and AGN activity of galaxies undergoing
stripping remain unclear. Numerical studies have recently demonstrated cosmic
rays can dramatically influence galaxy evolution for isolated galaxies, yet
their influence on ram pressure stripping remains poorly constrained. We
perform the first cosmic-ray magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of an $L_{*}$
galaxy undergoing ram pressure stripping, including radiative cooling,
self-gravity of the gas, star formation, and stellar feedback. We find the
microscopic transport of cosmic rays plays a key role in modulating the star
formation enhancement experienced by spirals at the outskirts of clusters
compared to isolated spirals. Moreover, we find that galaxies undergoing ram
pressure stripping exhibit enhanced gas accretion onto their centers, which may
explain the prevalence of AGN in these objects. In agreement with observations,
we find cosmic rays significantly boost the global radio emission of cluster
spirals. Although the gas removal rate is relatively insensitive to cosmic ray
physics, we find that cosmic rays significantly modify the phase distribution
of the remaining gas disk. These results suggest observations of galaxies
undergoing ram pressure stripping may place novel constraints on cosmic-ray
calorimetry and transport.

has sought to develop techniques that make the decision making of sequential
decision making AI systems more explainable to end-users. Critically, prior
work in applying XAIP techniques to IDS systems has assumed that the plan being
proposed by the planner is always optimal, and therefore the action or plan
being recommended as decision support to the user is always correct. In this
work, we examine novice user interactions with a non-robust IDS system -- one
that occasionally recommends the wrong action, and one that may become
unavailable after users have become accustomed to its guidance. We introduce a
novel explanation type, subgoal-based explanations, for planning-based IDS
systems, that supplements traditional IDS output with information about the
subgoal toward which the recommended action would contribute. We demonstrate
that subgoal-based explanations lead to improved user task performance, improve
user ability to distinguish optimal and suboptimal IDS recommendations, are
preferred by users, and enable more robust user performance in the case of IDS

using commercial WiFi devices have emerged which offer low-cost ubiquitous
sensing whilst preserving privacy. However, the output of an RF sensing system,
such as Range-Doppler spectrograms, cannot represent human motion intuitively
and usually requires further processing. In this study, MDPose, a novel
framework for human skeletal motion reconstruction based on WiFi micro-Doppler
signatures, is proposed. It provides an effective solution to track human
activities by reconstructing a skeleton model with 17 key points, which can
assist with the interpretation of conventional RF sensing outputs in a more
understandable way. Specifically, MDPose has various incremental stages to
gradually address a series of challenges: First, a denoising algorithm is
implemented to remove any unwanted noise that may affect the feature extraction
and enhance weak Doppler signatures. Secondly, the convolutional neural network
(CNN)-recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture is applied to learn
temporal-spatial dependency from clean micro-Doppler signatures and restore key
points' velocity information. Finally, a pose optimising mechanism is employed
to estimate the initial state of the skeleton and to limit the increase of
error. We have conducted comprehensive tests in a variety of environments using
numerous subjects with a single receiver radar system to demonstrate the
performance of MDPose, and report 29.4mm mean absolute error over all key
points positions, which outperforms state-of-the-art RF-based pose estimation

performance of an Optical Music Recognition (OMR) system. It identifies the
regions of interest, such as staves or lyrics, which must then be processed in
order to transcribe their content. Despite the existence of modern approaches
based on deep learning, an exhaustive study of LA in OMR has not yet been
carried out with regard to the precision of different models, their
generalization to different domains or, more importantly, their impact on
subsequent stages of the pipeline. This work focuses on filling this gap in
literature by means of an experimental study of different neural architectures,
music document types and evaluation scenarios. The need for training data has
also led to a proposal for a new semi-synthetic data generation technique that
enables the efficient applicability of LA approaches in real scenarios. Our
results show that: (i) the choice of the model and its performance are crucial
for the entire transcription process; (ii) the metrics commonly used to
evaluate the LA stage do not always correlate with the final performance of the
OMR system, and (iii) the proposed data-generation technique enables
state-of-the-art results to be achieved with a limited set of labeled data.

resources (DERs), based on the projected Newton method (PNM), for unbalanced
distribution networks. The optimal Volt/VAr control (VVC) problem is formulated
as an optimization program, with the goal of maintaining the voltage profile
across the network by coordinating the VAr outputs of DERs. To overcome the
slow convergence rate of conventional gradient-based methods, a PNM-based
solution algorithm is developed to solve this VVC problem. It utilizes a
non-diagonal symmetric positive definite matrix, developed from the Hessian
matrix of the objective, to scale the gradient, and thus a fast convergence
performance can be expected in this Newton-like algorithm. Moreover, taking
advantage of the instantaneous feedback of voltage measurements, the online
implementation of the PNM-based VVC is further designed to deal with fast
system variations. In this online PNM-based VVC scheme, each bus agent
communicates the instantaneous voltage measurements to the central agent, and
the central agent communicates the VAr output commands of DERs back to each bus
agent. The fast convergence performance of PNM results in a stronger capability
to track the system variations in real time. Finally, numerical case studies
are performed to validate the effectiveness, superiority, and scalability of
the proposed method.

compared to the wetting on rigid substrates. The contact angle of the liquid is
no longer governed by Young's law, but is affected by the substrate's bulk and
surface deformations. On top of that, elastic interfaces exhibit a surface
energy that depends on how much they are stretched -- a feature known as the
Shuttleworth effect (or as surface-elasticity). Here we present two models by
which we explore the wetting of drops in the presence of a strong Shuttleworth
effect. The first model is macroscopic in character and consistently accounts
for large deformations via a neo-Hookean elasticity. The second model is based
on a mesoscopic description of wetting, using a reduced description of the
substrate's elasticity. While the second model is more empirical in terms of
the elasticity, it enables a gradient dynamics formulation for soft wetting
dynamics. We provide a detailed comparison between the equilibrium states
predicted by the two models, from which we deduce robust features of soft
wetting in the presence of a strong Shuttleworth effect. Specifically, we show
that the (a)symmetry of the Shuttleworth effect between the ""dry"" and ""wet""

networks (DNNs) to perform critical tasks. Due to their high complexity, the
execution of these DNNs requires excessive time and energy. Low-complexity
object tracking (OT) can be used with OD, where the latter is periodically
applied to generate ""fresh"" references for tracking. However, the frames
processed with OD incur large delays, which may make the reference outdated and
degrade tracking quality. Herein, we propose to use edge computing in this
context, and establish parallel OT (at the mobile device) and OD (at the edge
server) processes that are resilient to large OD latency. We propose Katch-Up,
a novel tracking mechanism that improves the system resilience to excessive OD
delay. However, while Katch-Up significantly improves performance, it also
increases the computing load of the mobile device. Hence, we design SmartDet, a
low-complexity controller based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that
learns controlling the trade-off between resource utilization and OD
performance. SmartDet takes as input context-related information related to the
current video content and the current network conditions to optimize frequency
and type of OD offloading, as well as Katch-Up utilization. We extensively
evaluate SmartDet on a real-world testbed composed of a JetSon Nano as mobile
device and a GTX 980 Ti as edge server, connected through a Wi-Fi link.
Experimental results show that SmartDet achieves an optimal balance between
tracking performance - mean Average Recall (mAR) and resource usage. With
respect to a baseline with full Katch-Upusage and maximum channel usage, we
still increase mAR by 4% while using 50% less of the channel and 30% power
resources associated with Katch-Up. With respect to a fixed strategy using
minimal resources, we increase mAR by 20% while using Katch-Up on 1/3 of the
frames.

prove that for any such $A$ with unit-length columns, there exists a continuous
choice of subspaces $t\mapsto U(t)\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ such that for $v\in
U(t)$, $\|A(t)v\|\geq c\|v\|$ where $c$ is some universal constant.
Furthermore, the $U(t)$ are chosen so that their dimension satisfies a lower
bound with optimal asymptotic dependence on $n$ and $\sup_{t\in
\mathbb{R}}\|A(t)\|.$ We provide two methods. The first relies on an
orthogonality argument, while the second is probabilistic and combinatorial in
nature. The latter does not yield the optimal bound for $\dim(U(t))$ but the
$U(t)$ obtained in this way are guaranteed to have a canonical representation
as joined-together spaces spanned by subsets of the unit vector basis.

time of flight of around 26 years or so. The efficacy of this trajectory is a
result of it significantly reducing the $\Delta$V to Jupiter by exploiting the
VEEGA sequence. The total $\Delta$V of the trajectory is 15.8 $kms^{-1}$ and
the corresponding payload mass is 115 kg for a SLS Block 1B or 241 kg for a

is carried out with approximate density functional theory (DFT) using a single
functional. Despite development of numerous MR diagnostics, the extent to which
a single value of such a diagnostic indicates MR effect on chemical property
prediction is not well established. We evaluate MR diagnostics of over 10,000
transition metal complexes (TMCs) and compare to those in organic molecules. We
reveal that only some MR diagnostics are transferable across these materials

MR effect) that involves multiple potential energy surfaces (i.e., adiabatic
spin splitting, $\Delta E_\mathrm{H-L}$, and ionization potential, IP), we
observe that cancellation in MR effect outweighs accumulation. Differences in
MR character are more important than the total degree of MR character in
predicting MR effect in property prediction. Motivated by this observation, we
build transfer learning models to directly predict CCSD(T)-level adiabatic
$\Delta E_\mathrm{H-L}$ and IP from lower levels of theory. By combining these
models with uncertainty quantification and multi-level modeling, we introduce a
multi-pronged strategy that accelerates data acquisition by at least a factor

binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1643-1224 over five years using the Large
European Array for Pulsars (LEAP). The 2D power spectrum of scintillation,
called the secondary spectrum, often shows a parabolic distribution of power,
where the arc curvature encodes the relative velocities and distances of the
pulsar, ionised interstellar medium (IISM), and Earth. We observe a clear
parabolic scintillation arc which varies in curvature throughout the year. The
distribution of power in the secondary spectra are inconsistent with a single
scattering screen which is fully 1D, or entirely isotropic. We fit the observed
arc curvature variations with two models; an isotropic scattering screen, and a
model with two independent 1D screens. We measure the distance to the
scattering screen to be in the range 114-223 pc, depending on the model,
consistent with the known distance of the foreground large-diameter HII region
Sh 2-27 (112+/-17 pc), suggesting that it is the dominant source of scattering.
We obtain only weak constraints on the pulsar's orbital inclination and angle
of periastron, since the scintillation pattern is not very sensitive to the
pulsar's motion, since the screen is much closer to the Earth than the pulsar.
More measurements of this kind - where scattering screens can be associated
with foreground objects - will help to inform the origins and distribution of
scattering screens within our galaxy.

topology of real-world smart grids. In this regard, we have updated the
Chung-Lu algorithm to guarantee the communication network connectivity and to
match the degree distribution of a real-world smart grid rather than following
an expected degree distribution. In addition, key characteristics of
communication systems such as diameter, average shortest paths, clustering

generate the most similar real-world communication network for smart grid

futuristic 6G networks require a novel framework that can be used to operate,
manage, and optimize its underlying services such as ultra-reliable and

artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant success in optimizing
and designing networks. The AI-enabled traffic orchestration can dynamically
organize different network architectures and slices to provide quality of
experience considering the dynamic nature of the wireless communication
network.
  In this paper, we propose a digital twin enabled network framework, empowered
by AI to cater the variability and complexity of envisioned 6G networks, to
provide smart resource management and intelligent service provisioning. Digital
twin paves a way for achieving optimizing 6G services by creating a virtual
representation of the 6G network along with its associated communication
technologies (e.g., intelligent reflecting surfaces, terahertz and millimeter
communication), computing systems (e.g., cloud computing and fog computing)
with its associated algorithms (e.g., optimization and machine learning). We
then discuss and review the existing AI-enabled traffic management and

states are obtained by the Skyrme Hartree-Fock method in three-dimensional
coordinate space, which properly describes any nuclear shape. Three types of
Skyrme interactions are employed to generate various deformed states in its
isotopic chain. We find that in the island of inversion the occupation of
highly elongated intruder orbits induces not only large quadrupole deformation
but also large hexadecapole deformation. This appears as a sizable enhancement
of the nuclear matter radius, showing the characteristic shell effect of the
density profile near the nuclear surface. We show that the edge of the island
of inversion, where the intruder orbit starts being occupied, can be determined
by measuring the enhancement of the total reaction cross section at high
incident energy. The possibility of constraining the hexadecapole deformation
by a measurement of the total reaction cross sections is discussed.

convertible nonconvex function operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication or division result in convertible nonconvex functions. The
sufficient condition for judging a global optimal solution to unconstrained
optimization problems with differentiable convertible nonconvex functions is
proved, which is equivalent to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) condition. Two Lagrange
functions of differentiable convertible nonconvex function are defined with
their dual problems defined accordingly. The strong duality theorem is proved,
showing that the optimal objective value of the global optimal solution is
equal to the optimal objective value of the dual problem, which is equivalent
to KKT condition. An augmented Lagrangian penalty function algorithm is
proposed and its convergence is proved. So the paper provides a new idea for
solving unconstrained nonconvex or non-smooth optimization problems and avoids

velocity power spectra of the VCFs. These power spectra are well represented
with power laws showing similar slopes for both quantities (with a mean of
about -2), albeit some differ by up to a factor of two. The position velocity
diagrams perpendicular to three VCFs show the V-shaped velocity pattern,
corresponding to a bent structure in velocity space with the filament at the
tip of the V surrounded by an extended structure connected to it with a
velocity gradient. This velocity structure is qualitatively similar to that
resulting from numerical simulations of filament formation from large-scale
compression from propagating shock fronts. In addition, the radial profiles
perpendicular to these VCFs hint to small-scale internal impacts from
neighbouring HII bubbles. The observed opposite curvature in velocity space
towards the VCFs points to various origins of large-scale external compressions
from propagating HI bubbles. This suggests the plausible importance of multiple
HI compressions, separated in space and time, in the formation and evolution of
molecular clouds and their star formation history. These latter atomic
compressions due to past and distant star formation events are complemented by
the impact of HII bubbles from present time and local star formation activity.

rate measurements from Hb, [OIII], Ha, and [NII]. Using stacks of Spitzer,
Herschel, and ALMA photometry (rest-frame ~ 8-400$\mu$m), we examine the IR SED
of high-redshift subsolar metallicity (~0.5 $Z_{\odot}$) LIRGs. We find that
the data agree well with an average SED template of higher luminosity local
low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (reduced $\chi^2$ of 1.8). When compared with
the commonly used templates for solar-metallicity local galaxies or
high-redshift LIRGs and ULIRGs, even in the most favorable case (with reduced
$\chi^2$ of 2.8), the templates are rejected at >98% confidence level. The
broader and hotter IR SED of both the local dwarfs and high-redshift subsolar
metallicity galaxies may result from different grain properties, a clumpy dust
geometry, or a harder/more intense ionizing radiation field that heats the dust
to higher temperatures. The obscured SFR indicated by the FIR emission of the
subsolar metallicity galaxies is only ~ 60% of the total SFR, which is
considerably lower than that of the local LIRGs with ~ 96-97% obscured
fractions. Due to the evolving IR SED shape, the local LIRG templates fit to
mid-IR data can overestimate the Rayleigh-Jeans tail measurements at z~2 by a
factor of 2-20, and these templates underestimate IR luminosities if fit to the
observed ALMA fluxes by >0.4dex. At a given stellar mass or metallicity, dust
masses at z~2.3 are an order of magnitude higher than those at z~0. Given the
predicted molecular gas mass fractions, the observed z~2.3 dust-to-stellar mass
ratios suggest lower dust-to-molecular gas masses than in local galaxies at the

virtual horizon's location, additional research is needed to explore this
assumption through a structured approach to visual perception in Virtual

spatial conditions configured by three room sizes and the presence of virtual
objects (3 X 2), which were set according to differing Angles of Declination

virtual objects significantly affect the threshold range, it being greater in
the large-sized condition and furnished condition. This indicates that the
effect of relative translation gains can be further increased by constructing a
perceived virtual movable space that is even larger than the adjusted virtual
movable space and placing objects in it. Our study can be applied to adjust
virtual spaces in synchronizing heterogeneous spaces without coordinate
distortion where real and virtual objects can be leveraged to create realistic

asymmetrically modulated in momentum space, and the valley degree of freedom is
activated and controlled by the magnitudes and directions of the uniform and
staggered magnetic fields; as a result, the Majorana excitation is either
gapped or gapless, the latter of which in general has Majorana Fermi surfaces,
in contrast to the point nodes in the absence of the fields. We show that the
asymmetric deformation of the Majorana band induces a nonlinear (nonreciprocal)
thermal transport, in addition to the linear one. The field dependence of the
linear thermal current is correlated with the magnitude of the Majorana gap,
while that of the nonlinear thermal current is associated with the asymmetry of
the Majorana excitation spectra. We show the estimates of the thermal currents
and discuss that the linear response is experimentally measurable, whereas
future improvement is required for the observation of the nonlinear one. We

  Aims: Our goal is to develop a model-unbiased technique using transit
spectroscopy to analyze every qualified atomic spectral line in exoplanetary
transit data, and search for relative absorption, that is, a decrease in the
flux of the line when the planet is transiting.
  Methods: We analyzed archive data from HDS at Subaru, HIRES at Keck, UVES at
VLT, and HARPS at LaSilla to test our spectral survey methodology. It first
filtered individual lines by relative noise levels. It also corrected for
spectral offsets and telluric contamination. Our methodology performed an

number of unit cells which leads to complicated design and optimization.
Aggressive discretization in a metasurface can significantly reduce the number
of unit cells within a period, resulting in lower requirement for phase and/or
surface impedance coverage. Additionally, the enlarged unit cells will
encounter negligible mutual couplings when combined together, hence making
straightforward the process of metasurface design. These advantages combine to
allow the design of a novel class of metasurfaces which support the high
efficiency redirection of electromagnetic (EM) waves over a wide bandwidth and
operation angle. Moreover, an aggressively discretized metasurface may realize
functionalities such as diffraction mode circulation, which are unsupported in
its continuous counterparts. In this paper we propose a simple transmissive
metasurface which can realize diffraction mode circulation by refracting plane
waves with incident angles of -45, 0, 45 degrees to plane waves with refraction

billions of dollars in damage every year. Toward the end of better
understanding and mitigating these attacks, we present a set of machine
learning models that learn from localized news data in order to predict whether
a terrorist attack will occur on a given calendar date and in a given state.
The best model--a Random Forest that learns from a novel variable-length moving
average representation of the feature space--achieves area under the receiver
operating characteristic scores $> .667$ on four of the five states that were
impacted most by terrorism between 2015 and 2018. Our key findings include that
modeling terrorism as a set of independent events, rather than as a continuous
process, is a fruitful approach--especially when the events are sparse and
dissimilar. Additionally, our results highlight the need for localized models
that account for differences between locations. From a machine learning
perspective, we found that the Random Forest model outperformed several deep
models on our multimodal, noisy, and imbalanced data set, thus demonstrating
the efficacy of our novel feature representation method in such a context. We
also show that its predictions are relatively robust to time gaps between
attacks and observed characteristics of the attacks. Finally, we analyze
factors that limit model performance, which include a noisy feature space and
small amount of available data. These contributions provide an important
foundation for the use of machine learning in efforts against terrorism in the
United States and beyond.

For a

only on a few parameters characterizing the boson-impurity interactions. When
boson-impurity interactions are weak, it has been known for some time that the
properties of the polaron depend only on the scattering length of these
interactions. In this paper which accompanies and extends Ref. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 126, 123403 (2021)] (where some of these results have already been

finite. We demonstrate that for attractive interactions between impurity and
the bosons up to and including the unitary point of these interactions, all
static properties of a Bose polaron in a dilute Bose gas can be calculated in
terms of the scattering length and an additional parameter which characterizes
the range of the impurity-boson interactions. We show that our approach to this
problem is valid if this parameter does not deviate too much from the
scattering length of intra-boson interactions, with the precise criterion given

Several solid-state spin sensors have been developed, facilitating the

while to date, those levels are scarcely reached due to the broadened linewidth
and inefficient readout of solid-state spin ensembles. Here, we experimentally
demonstrate that such drawbacks can be overcome by newly reborn maser
technology at room temperature in the solid state. Owing to maser action, we
observe a 4-fold reduction in the inhomogeneously broadened linewidth of a
molecular spin ensemble, which is narrower than the same measured from single
spins at cryogenic temperatures. The maser-based readout applied to
magnetometry showcases a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30 dB for single shots.
This technique would be a significant addition to the toolbox for boosting the

temperature conditions typical of the silicate-atmosphere interface of
sub-Neptune planets, which can exceed 5000 K. Previous models of the
atmospheric structure and evolution of these exoplanets, which have been used
to constrain their atmospheric mass fractions, have neglected this
compositional coupling. In this work, we show that silicate vapor in a
hydrogen-dominated atmosphere acts as a condensable species, decreasing in
abundance with altitude. The resultant mean molecular weight gradient inhibits
convection at temperatures above $\sim 4000$ K, inducing a near-surface
radiative layer. This radiative layer decreases the planet's total radius
compared to a planet with the same base temperature and a convective, pure H/He
atmosphere. Therefore, we expect silicate vapor to have major effects on the
inferred envelope mass fraction and thermal evolution of sub-Neptune planets.
We demonstrate that differences in radii, and hence in inferred atmospheric
masses, are largest for planets which have larger masses, equilibrium
temperatures, and atmospheric mass fractions. The effects are largest for
younger planets, but differences can persist on gigayear time-scales for some
sub-Neptunes. For a $10 M_\oplus$ planet with $T_\mathrm{eq}=1000$ K and an age
of $\sim 300$ Myr, an observed radius consistent with an atmospheric mass
fraction of 10% when accounting for silicate vapor would be misinterpreted as
indicating an atmospheric mass fraction of 2% if a H/He-only atmosphere were
assumed. The presence of silicate vapor in the atmosphere is also expected to
have important implications for the accretion and loss of primordial hydrogen
atmospheres.

G-CADA partitions the workers into groups of workers that are assigned the same

suffers from noise due to the maximum permissible exposure of laser intensity,
attenuation of ultrasound in the tissue, and the inherent noise of the

image quality can be recovered. However, previous de-noising techniques usually
heavily rely on mathematical priors as well as manually selected parameters,
resulting in unsatisfactory and slow de-noising performance for different noisy
images, which greatly hinders practical and clinical applications. In this
work, we propose a deep learning-based method to remove complex noise from PAM
images without mathematical priors and manual selection of settings for
different input images. An attention enhanced generative adversarial network is
used to extract image features and remove various noises. The proposed method
is demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets, including phantom (leaf
veins) and in vivo (mouse ear blood vessels and zebrafish pigment) experiments.
The results show that compared with previous PAM de-noising methods, our method
exhibits good performance in recovering images qualitatively and
quantitatively. In addition, the de-noising speed of 0.016 s is achieved for an
image with $256\times256$ pixels. Our approach is effective and practical for

spin-correlation ratio as an order parameter we can characterize impurity
quantum phase transitions driven by channel asymmetry. In particular, the
universal critical exponents $\beta$ of the spin-correlation ratio and $\nu$ of
the correlation length are explicitly determined by finite-sizescaling

independently eliminate both intrinsic and extrinsic risks by securing their
links with partners, or alternatively, firms can cooperate with partners to
eliminate sources of intrinsic risk in the network. We develop a
graph-theoretic model of interdependent security and demonstrate that the

use cooperative game-theoretic tools to examine whether and when firms can
sustain the network-optimal security strategy via cost-sharing mechanisms that

on minimizing the number of viewpoints or traveling distance of robots under
the condition of full coverage inspection. The measurement uncertainty when
collecting the scanning data is less considered in the free-form surface
inspection. To address this problem, a novel CPP method with the optimal
viewpoint sampling strategy is proposed to incorporate the measurement
uncertainty of key measurement points (MPs) into free-form surface inspection.
At first, the feasible ranges of measurement uncertainty are calculated based
on the tolerance specifications of the MPs. The initial feasible viewpoint set
is generated considering the measurement uncertainty and the visibility of MPs.
Then, the inspection cost function is built to evaluate the number of selected
viewpoints and the average measurement uncertainty in the field of views (FOVs)
of all the selected viewpoints. Afterward, an enhanced rapidly-exploring random
tree (RRT*) algorithm is proposed for viewpoint sampling using the inspection
cost function and CPP optimization. Case studies, including simulation tests
and inspection experiments, have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
of the proposed method. Results show that the scanning precision of key MPs is

possible to produce a larger set of $n+m$ samples which cannot be distinguished

question as the sample amplification problem, and gave optimal amplification
procedures for discrete distributions and Gaussian location models. However,
these procedures and associated lower bounds are tailored to the specific
distribution classes, and a general statistical understanding of sample

amplification problem on a firm statistical foundation by deriving generally
applicable amplification procedures, lower bound techniques and connections to
existing statistical notions. Our techniques apply to a large class of
distributions including the exponential family, and establish a rigorous
connection between sample amplification and distribution learning.

cause of disability. Cartilage defects are regarded as major manifestations of
knee OA, which are visible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thus early
detection and assessment for knee cartilage defects are important for
protecting patients from knee OA. In this way, many attempts have been made on
knee cartilage defect assessment by applying convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to knee MRI. However, the physiologic characteristics of the cartilage
may hinder such efforts: the cartilage is a thin curved layer, implying that
only a small portion of voxels in knee MRI can contribute to the cartilage
defect assessment; heterogeneous scanning protocols further challenge the
feasibility of the CNNs in clinical practice; the CNN-based knee cartilage
evaluation results lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we model
the cartilages structure and appearance from knee MRI into a graph
representation, which is capable of handling highly diverse clinical data.
Then, guided by the cartilage graph representation, we design a non-Euclidean
deep learning network with the self-attention mechanism, to extract cartilage
features in the local and global, and to derive the final assessment with a
visualized result. Our comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method
yields superior performance in knee cartilage defect assessment, plus its

oscillation can be described as coordinated variations of the accretion rate,
Comptonised flux, and the inner disc radius, with the latter ranging from
1.235-5 gravitational radii. Comparison with results from the $\chi$ and

robots, including ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, are described using
their $SE(3)$ pose and satisfy conservation of energy principles. We design a
physically plausible model of the robot dynamics by imposing the structure of
Hamilton's equations of motion in the design of a neural ordinary differential

$SE(3)$ kinematic constraints and energy conservation by construction. It also
allows us to derive an energy-based adaptive controller that achieves
trajectory tracking while compensating for disturbances. Our learning-based

derived based on the priori statistical characteristic of the noise, target

measured by the joint entropy deviation and the joint information that is

proposed, and their performance is measured by the empirical joint entropy

the joint information is the available limit of the overall performance, that
is, the joint information is available, and the empirical joint information of
any JDEer is no greater than the joint information; (5) the cascaded theorem is
proved that the sum of empirical detection information and empirical estimation

of cascaded JDEer is available. Simulation results verify the correctness of
the joint and the cascaded theorems, and show that the performance of the

wavefunctions of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) on a mirror bounded by the Earth's

resolution. We are developing a UCN detector for the with a high spatial
resolution, which consists of a Si substrate, a thin converter layer including
$^{10}$B$_{4}$C, and a layer of fine-grained nuclear emulsion. Its resolution
was estimated to be less than 100 nm by fitting tracks of either $^{7}$Li
nuclei or $\alpha$-particles, which were created when neutrons interacted with
the $^{10}$B$_{4}$C layer. For actual measurements of the spatial
distributions, the following two improvements were made: The first was to
establish a method to align microscopic images with high accuracy within a wide
region of 65 mm $\times$ 0.2 mm. We created reference marks of 1 $\mu$m and 5
$\mu$m diameter with an interval of 50 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$m, respectively, on
the Si substrate by electron beam lithography and realized a position accuracy
of less than 30 nm. The second was to build a holder that could maintain the
atmospheric pressure around the nuclear emulsion to utilize it under vacuum
during exposure to UCNs. The intrinsic resolution of the improved detector was
estimated by evaluating the blur of a transmission image of a gadolinium
grating taken by cold neutrons as better than 0.56 $\pm$ 0.08 $\mu$m, which
included the grating accuracy. A test exposure to UCNs was conducted to obtain
the spatial distribution of UCNs in the Earth's gravitational field. Although
the test was successful, a blurring of 6.9 $\mu$m was found in the
measurements, compared with a theoretical curve. We identified the blurring
caused by the refraction of UCNs due to the roughness of the upstream surface
of the substrate. Polishing of the surface makes the resolution less than 100
nm.

of semantic complexity as indices of the literariness, creativity and book
beauty of the works in GLEC (e.g., Jane Austen's six novels), and iii) two
experiments on text classification and authorship recognition using novel
features of semantic complexity. The data on two novel measures estimating a
text's literariness, intratextual variance and stepwise distance (van
Cranenburgh et al., 2019) revealed that plays are the most literary texts in
GLEC, followed by poems and novels. Computation of a novel index of text
creativity (Gray et al., 2016) revealed poems and plays as the most creative
categories with the most creative authors all being poets (Milton, Pope, Keats,
Byron, or Wordsworth). We also computed a novel index of perceived beauty of
verbal art (Kintsch, 2012) for the works in GLEC and predict that Emma is the
theoretically most beautiful of Austen's novels. Finally, we demonstrate that
these novel measures of semantic complexity are important features for text
classification and authorship recognition with overall predictive accuracies in
the range of .75 to .97. Our data pave the way for future computational and
empirical studies of literature or experiments in reading psychology and offer

an Accelerated Multi-Scale Aggregation network (AMSA) for Reference-based

the MSDA module consisting of Dynamic Aggregation and Multi-Scale Aggregation.
The Dynamic Aggregation corrects minor scale misalignment by dynamically

manipulating geometric and electronic behaviors of materials, especially
two-dimensional materials which are optically accessible owing to their high
surface to volume ratio. In the current work we focus on the recently
discovered two-dimensional sliding ferroelectric materials, in which the
out-of-plane electric polarization can be switched with a small horizontal
translation in one layer. Combining symmetry analysis and first-principles
calculations, we predict that light illumination could inject non-equilibrium
magnetic moments into the sliding ferroelectrics. Such magnetic moment is
composed of both spin and orbital degrees of freedom contributions. We use
$\mathrm{ZrI}_2$, $\mathrm{WTe}_2$, and $\mathrm{MoS}_2$ bilayer ferroelectrics
to illustrate our theory. Under intermediate light illumination, one can yield
non-equilibrium magnetic moments on the order of $0.1-1$ $\mu_B$ in these
systems, which also depends on the polarization nature of incident light.
Furthermore, we show that such photo-injected magnetism changes its sign when
the sliding dipole moment switches. This photo-magnetization can be detected by
magneto-optical methods (such as Kerr or Faraday effect), which serves as an
indicator of sliding ferroelectricity. Hence, one can use an all-optical pump
and probe setup to measure and detect the subtle sliding ferroelectric phase.

heat generation and temperature increase in STT-MRAM cache memories is write
operations, which are managed by cache replacement policy. In this paper, we
first analyze the cache behavior in the conventional LRU replacement policy and
demonstrate that the majority of consecutive write operations (more than 66%)
are committed to adjacent cache blocks. These adjacent write operations cause
accumulated heat and increased temperature, which significantly increases the
cache error rate. To eliminate heat accumulation and the adjacency of
consecutive writes, we propose a cache replacement policy, named Thermal-Aware
Least-Recently Written (TA-LRW), to smoothly distribute the generated heat by
conducting consecutive write operations in distant cache blocks. TA-LRW
guarantees the distance of at least three blocks for each two consecutive write
operations in an 8-way associative cache. This distant write scheme reduces the
temperature-induced error rate by 94.8%, on average, compared with the
conventional LRU policy, which results in 6.9x reduction in cache error rate.

condensate (axion cloud) around rotating black holes through superradiant
instability. Several effects due to the axion cloud, such as the spin-down of
black holes and the emission of monochromatic gravitational waves, open a new
window to search for axions by astrophysical observations. When the axion
self-interaction is considered, the evolution of cloud is altered
significantly, and an explosive phenomenon called bosenova can happen. Thus, it
is necessary to understand the precise evolution of self-interacting clouds for
the detection of axions by astrophysical observations. In this paper, we
propose a new method to track the whole process of the growth of
self-interacting axion clouds employing the adiabatic approximation. We
emphasize that our method relies neither on the non-relativistic approximation
nor on perturbative treatment of the self-interaction, which is often used in
literature. Our main finding is that the evolution of cloud in the strongly
self-interacting regime depends on the strength of the gravitational coupling
between the axion and the black hole. For a large coupling, the cloud evolves
into a quasi-stationary state where the superradiant energy gain is balanced
with the energy dissipation to infinity by the self-interaction. On the other
hand, when one decreases the size of coupling, clouds become unstable at some
energy, which would be interpreted as the onset of bosenova.

their density and temperature distributions, which in turn come from the

hydrodynamics and radiative transfer is a must to interpret the observational
results. In the case of non-rotating black holes, Pseudo-Newtonian description
of surrounding space-time enables one to make a significant progress in
predicting spectral and timing properties. This formalism is lacking for
spinning black holes. In this paper, we show that there exists an exact form of
'natural' potential derivable from the general relativistic (GR) radial
momentum equation. Use of this potential in an otherwise Newtonian set of
equations allows to describe transonic flows very accurately as is evidenced by
comparing with solutions obtained from the full GR framework. We study the
properties of the critical points and the centrifugal pressure supported shocks
in the parameter space spanned by the specific energy and the angular momentum,
and compare with the results of GR hydrodynamics. We show that this potential
can safely be used for the entire range of Kerr parameter $-1<a<1$ for modeling
of observational results around spinning black holes. We assume the flow to be
inviscid. Thus, it is non-dissipative with constant energy and angular
momentum. These assumptions are valid very close to the black hole as the
infall timescale is much shorter as compared to the viscous timescale.

(LIB) composite electrodes based on mechanistic approaches, allows predicting
the influence of manufacturing parameters on electrode properties. However,
ensuring that the calculated properties match well with experimental data, is
typically time and resources consuming In this work, we tackled this issue by
proposing a functional data-driven framework combining Functional Principal
Component Analysis and K-Nearest Neighbors algorithms. This aims first to
recover the early numerical values of a mechanistic electrode manufacturing
simulation to predict if the observable being calculated is prone to match or
not, \textit{i.e} screening step. In a second step it recovers additional
numerical values of the ongoing mechanistic simulation iterations to predict
the mechanistic simulation result, \textit{i.e} forecasting step. We
demonstrated this approach in context of LIB manufacturing through
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations, aiming to capture the
rheological behavior of electrode slurries. We discuss in full details our
novel methodology and we report that the expected mechanistic simulation
results can be obtained 11 times faster with respect to running the complete
mechanistic simulation, while being accurate enough from an experimental point
of view, with a $F1_{score}$ equals to 0.90, and a $R^2_{score}$ equals to 0.96
for the learnings validation. This paves the way towards a powerful tool to
drastically reduce the utilization of computational resources while running
mechanistic simulations of battery manufacturing electrodes.

image denoisers (DIDs), i.e, how well DIDs can recover the ground truth from
noisy observations degraded by adversarial perturbations. Firstly, to evaluate
DIDs' robustness, we propose a novel adversarial attack, namely
Observation-based Zero-mean Attack ({\sc ObsAtk}), to craft adversarial
zero-mean perturbations on given noisy images. We find that existing DIDs are
vulnerable to the adversarial noise generated by {\sc ObsAtk}. Secondly, to
robustify DIDs, we propose an adversarial training strategy, hybrid adversarial

non-adversarial noisy data to ensure that the reconstruction quality is high
and the denoisers around non-adversarial data are locally smooth. The resultant
DIDs can effectively remove various types of synthetic and adversarial noise.
We also uncover that the robustness of DIDs benefits their generalization
capability on unseen real-world noise. Indeed, {\sc HAT}-trained DIDs can
recover high-quality clean images from real-world noise even without training
on real noisy data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including
Set68, PolyU, and SIDD, corroborate the effectiveness of {\sc ObsAtk} and {\sc

take huge computation costs. Although the computation can be accelerated with
efficient transformers or distilled PLMs, it is still not enough to make timely

Motivated by this, we propose GateFormer, where the input data is gated before
feeding into transformers. The gating module is made personalized, lightweight

filtering of informative user input. GateFormer achieves highly impressive
performances in experiments, where it notably outperforms the existing

series of recent papers. Although the mathematical formula itself is not new,
Ellerman provided a sound probabilistic interpretation of $S_L$ as a measure of
the distinctions of a partition on a given set. The same formula comes across
as a useful definition of entropy in quantum mechanics, where it is linked to
the notion of purity of a quantum state. The quadratic form of the logical
entropy lends itself to a generalization of the probabilities that include
negative values, an idea that goes back to Feynman and Wigner. Here, we analyze
and reinterpret negative probabilities in the light of the concept of logical
entropy. Several intriguing quantum-like properties of the logical entropy are
derived and discussed in finite dimensional spaces. For infinite-dimensional
spaces (continuum), we show that, under the sole hypothesis that the logical
entropy and the total probability are preserved in time, one obtains an
evolution equation for the probability density that is basically identical to
the quantum evolution of the Wigner function in phase space, at least when one
considers only the momentum variable. This result suggest that the logical
entropy plays a profound role in establishing the peculiar rules of quantum

performance. Tackling the multiplexing problem, we propose a novel interface
for flash storage, FlashAlloc. It is used to pass the logical address ranges of
logical objects to the flash storage and thus enlighten the storage to stream
writes by objects. The object-aware flash storage can de-multiplex writes from
different objects with distinct deathtimes into per-object dedicated flash

direct measurement has $\rm \langle SNR \rangle \sim 4$, but we find that for

D4000$_{\rm n}$ has $\rm \langle SNR \rangle \sim 20$, but underestimates the
error by $>$50\%. Furthermore, the direct method recreates well the D4000-SFR

accurately classifies galaxies into red and blue populations. We conclude that

of quantum physics. In interferometry, this is typically achieved by evolving
highly-entangled quantum states before performing single-shot measurements to
reveal information about an unknown parameter. While this is often the optimum
approach, implementation with all but the smallest states is still extremely
challenging. An alternative approach is quantum jump metrology [L. A. Clark et
al., Phys. Rev. A 99, 022102 (2019)] which deduces information by continuously
monitoring an open quantum system, while inducing phase-dependent temporal
correlations with the help of quantum feedback. Taking this approach here, we
analyse measurements of a relative phase in an optical network of two cavities
with quantum feedback in the form of laser pulses. It is shown that the
proposed approach can exceed the standard quantum limit without the need for
complex quantum states while being scalable and more practical than previous
related schemes.

planet radii using the transit method have reached a precision that the effects
of stellar surface features have to be taken into account. While the effects
from spots have already been studied in detail, our knowledge of the effects
caused by faculae is still limited. This is particularly the case for M-stars.
Faculae can pose a problem if they are inhomogeneously distributed on the
stellar surface. Using the eclipse mapping method, we study the distribution of
the faculae on the surface of GJ1214 using the CaIIH&K lines as tracers. In
order to assess the homogeneity of the distribution in a quantitative way, we
introduce the inhomogeneity factor IHF. IHF is 0% if the distribution is
homogeneous, positive, if the plage regions are preferentially located along
the path of the planet, and negative, if they are preferentially located
outside the path of the planet. For GJ1214, we derive a rather small value of
IHF=7.7-7.7+12.0%. We discuss the relevance of this result in the context of
the PLATO and ARIEL missions.

of al brain and Central Nervous System (CNS) cancers. It is estimated that
annually over 13,000 deaths occur in the US due to GBM, making it crucial to
have early diagnosis systems that can lead to predictable and effective
treatment. The most common treatment after GBM diagnosis is chemotherapy, which
works by sending rapidly dividing cells to apoptosis. However, this form of
treatment is not effective when the MGMT promoter sequence is methylated, and
instead leads to severe side effects decreasing patient survivability.
Therefore, it is important to be able to identify the MGMT promoter methylation
status through non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based machine
learning (ML) models. This is accomplished using the Brain Tumor Segmentation
(BraTS) 2021 dataset, which was recently used for an international Kaggle
competition. We developed four primary models - two radiomic models and two CNN
models - each solving the binary classification task with progressive
improvements. We built a novel ML model termed as the Intermediate State
Generator which was used to normalize the slice thicknesses of all MRI scans.
With further improvements, our best model was able to achieve performance
significantly ($p < 0.05$) better than the best performing Kaggle model with a
6% increase in average cross-validation accuracy. This improvement could
potentially lead to a more informed choice of chemotherapy as a treatment
option, prolonging lives of thousands of patients with GBM each year.

rotation profiles. Typically this `vertical shear' issues from a baroclinic
effect driven by the central star's radiation field, but it might also arise
during the launching of a magnetocentrifugal wind. As a consequence,
protoplanetary discs are subject to a hydrodynamical instability, the `vertical
shear instability' (VSI), whose breakdown into turbulence could transport a
moderate amount of angular momentum and facilitate, or interfere with, the
process of planet formation. Magnetic fields may suppress the VSI, however,
either directly via magnetic tension or indirectly through magnetorotational
turbulence. On the other hand, protoplanetary discs exhibit notoriously low
ionisation fractions, and non-ideal effects, if sufficiently dominant, may come
to the VSI's rescue. In this paper we develop a local linear theory that
explores how non-ideal MHD influences the VSI, while also launching additional
diffusive shear instabilities. We derive a set of analytical criteria that
establish when the VSI prevails, and then show how it can be applied to a
realistic global model of a protoplanetary disc. Our calculations suggest that
within ~10au the VSI should have little trouble emerging in the main body of
the disk, but beyond that, and in the upper regions of the disc, its onset
depends sensitively on the size of the preponderant dust grains.

(RI) and radiatively efficient (RE)], with distinct optical and infrared
signatures, and two jet dynamical behaviours, which in arcsec- to
arcmin-resolution radio surveys manifest primarily as centre- or
edge-brightened structures [Fanaroff-Riley (FR) class I and II]. The nature of
the relationship between accretion mode and radio morphology (FR class) has
been the subject of long debate. We present a comprehensive investigation of
this relationship for a sample of 286 well-resolved radio galaxies in the LOFAR
Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields (LoTSS-Deep) first data release, for which
robust morphological and accretion mode classifications have been made. We find
that two-thirds of luminous FRII radio galaxies are RI, and identify no
significant differences in the visual appearance or source dynamic range
(peak/mean surface brightness) of the RI and RE FRIIs, demonstrating that both
RI and RE systems can produce FRII structures. We also find a significant
population of low-luminosity FRIIs (predominantly RI), supporting our earlier
conclusion that FRII radio structures can be produced at all radio
luminosities. We demonstrate that in the luminosity range where both
morphologies are present, the probability of producing FRI or FRII radio
morphology is directly linked to stellar mass, while across all morphologies
and luminosities, RE accretion occurs in systems with high specific star
formation rate, presumably because this traces fuel availability. In summary,
the relationship between accretion mode and radio morphology is very indirect,
with host-galaxy environment controlling these two key parameters in different
ways.

CFR systems. Given these developments, the contributions of this survey are
three-fold. First, we provide an overview of CFR, by formalizing the CFR
problem and presenting related applications. Secondly, we discuss the
appropriate spectral bands for face recognition and discuss recent CFR methods,
placing emphasis on deep neural networks. In particular we describe techniques
that have been proposed to extract and compare heterogeneous features emerging
from different spectral bands. We also discuss the datasets that have been used
for evaluating CFR methods. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future lines

a graph attention-based multi-task adversarial learning framework in two drug

Combinations of multimodal tasks achieve the best performance compared to other
multi-task joint models. (2) The local-global combination models yield higher
performance than random two-task combinations when there are the same size of
modalities. Therefore, we conjecture that the multimodal and local-global
combination strategies can be treated as the guideline of multi-task SSL for
drug discovery.

interest, namely (i) to maximize the total spectral efficiency (SE), and (ii)
to maximize the minimum SE of all users. As the considered problems are
non-convex, existing solutions rely on successive convex approximation to find
a sub-optimal solution. The known methods use off-the-shelf convex solvers,
which basically implement an interior-point algorithm, to solve the derived
convex problems. The main issue of such methods is that their complexity does
not scale favorably with the problem size, limiting previous studies to
cell-free massive MIMO of moderate scales. Thus the potential of cell-free
massive MIMO has not been fully understood. To address this issue, we propose
an accelerated projected gradient method to solve the considered problems.
Particularly, the proposed solution is found in closed-form expressions and
only requires the first order information of the objective, rather than the
Hessian matrix as in known solutions, and thus is much more memory efficient.
Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed solution achieves far less

  Program States",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coverage-guided Greybox Fuzzing (CGF) is one of the most successful and
widely-used techniques for bug hunting. Two major approaches are adopted to
optimize CGF: (i) to reduce search space of inputs by inferring relationships
between input bytes and path constraints; (ii) to formulate fuzzing processes
(e.g., path transitions) and build up probability distributions to optimize
power schedules, i.e., the number of inputs generated per seed. However, the
former is subjective to the inference results which may include extra bytes for
a path constraint, thereby limiting the efficiency of path constraints
resolution, code coverage discovery, and bugs exposure; the latter
formalization, concentrating on power schedules for seeds alone, is inattentive
to the schedule for bytes in a seed. In this paper, we propose a lightweight
fuzzing approach, Truzz, to optimize existing Coverage-guided Greybox Fuzzers
(CGFs). To address two aforementioned challenges, Truzz identifies the bytes
related to the validation checks (i.e., the checks guarding error-handling
code), and protects those bytes from being frequently mutated, making most
generated inputs examine the functionalities of programs, in lieu of being
rejected by validation checks. The byte-wise relationship determination
mitigates the problem of loading extra bytes when fuzzers infer the
byte-constraint relation. Furthermore, the proposed path transition within
Truzz can efficiently prioritize the seed as the new path, harvesting many new
edges, and the new path likely belongs to a code region with many undiscovered
code lines. The experimental results show that on average, Truzz can generate
16.14% more inputs flowing into functional code, in addition to 24.75% more new
edges than the vanilla fuzzers. Finally, our approach exposes 13 bugs in 8
target programs, and 6 of them have not been identified by the vanilla fuzzers.

stability of the periodic equations. Based on the iterative method, we provide
a unified algorithm to compute the Floquet multipliers (characteristic

equations on time scales unifying discrete, continuous, and hybrid dynamics.
Our approach is based on calculating the value of A and B (see Theorem 3.1),
which are the sum and product of all Floquet multipliers (characteristic
multipliers) of the system, respectively. We obtain an explicit expression of A
(see Theorem 4.1) by the method of variation and approximation theory and an
explicit expression of B by Liouville's formula. Furthermore, a computer
program is designed to realize our algorithm. Specifically, you can determine
the stability of a second order periodic linear system, whether they are
discrete, continuous or hybrid, as long as you enter the program codes
associated with the parameters of the equation. In fact, few literatures have
dealt with the algorithm to compute the Floquet multipliers, not mention to
design the program for its computer realization. Our algorithm gives the
explicit expressions of all Floquet multipliers and our computer program is
based on the approximations of these explicit expressions. In particular, on an
arbitrary discrete periodic time scale, we can do a finite number of
calculations to get the explicit value of Floquet multipliers (see Theorem
4.2). Therefore, for any discrete periodic system, we can accurately determine
the stability of the system even without computer! Finally, in Section 6,
several examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm.

a valuable green communication technology for future wireless networks.
Combining a massive HAD-MIMO with direction of arrival (DOA) will provide a
high-precision even ultra-high-precision DOA measurement performance
approaching the fully-digital (FD) MIMO. However, phase ambiguity is a
challenge issue for a massive HAD-MIMO DOA estimation. In this paper, we review
three aspects: detection, estimation, and Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with
low-resolution ADCs at receiver. First, a multi-layer-neural-network (MLNN)
detector is proposed to infer the existence of passive emitters. Then, a
two-layer HAD (TLHAD) MIMO structure is proposed to eliminate phase ambiguity
using only one-snapshot. Simulation results show that the proposed MLNN
detector is much better than both the existing generalized likelihood ratio
test (GRLT) and the ratio of maximum eigen-value (Max-EV) to minimum
eigen-value (R-MaxEV-MinEV) in terms of detection probability. Additionally,
the proposed TLHAD structure can achieve the corresponding CRLB using single

present a novel obstacle avoidance system by combining a 3D camera with a

and maps it onto a 2D vibration array on the forearm. In our functionality
tests of the haptic feedback sleeve, users were able to correctly identify and
localize 98,6% of single motor vibration patterns and 70% of multidirectional
and multi-motor vibration patterns. The combined obstacle avoidance system was
evaluated on a testing route in the dark, simulating a navigation task. All
users were able to complete the task and showed performance improvement over
multiple runs. The system is independent of lighting conditions and can be used
indoors and outdoors. Therefore, the obstacle avoidance system demonstrates a
promising approach towards using technology to enable more independence for the
visually impaired.

Immersed Boundary Method of Tschisgale et al. (2018) is enhanced by the
collision forces using the hard-sphere approach, so that the resulting model
accounts for fluid forces throughout the entire collision process.
Additionally, a new lubrication model is proposed that applies a constant
lubrication force in the region where hydrodynamic forces are not resolved by
the spatial grid. The new collision model is validated against benchmark test
cases of particle wall collisions with excellent agreement. Furthermore, the
collision of an ellipsoidal particle with a wall is investigated. The normal
restitution coefficient in the case of ellipsoidal particles does not solely
depend upon the Stokes number as in the case of spherical particles but is also
a function of its shape, and the orientation before the collision. Using the
new model, the effect of these parameters on the rebound trajectory is studied.
It is found that the maximum normal restitution coefficient decreases
significantly as the flatness of the particle increases. Also, the coefficient
of restitution depends on the particle orientation, a tendency increasing with
particle flatness. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Note, that the distance algorithm described

develop a criterion to certify whether the direct causal effects between the
observable variables are identifiable based on the observed covariance matrix.
Linear structural equation models assume that both observed and latent
variables solve a linear equation system featuring stochastic noise terms. Each
model corresponds to a directed graph whose edges represent the direct effects
that appear as coefficients in the equation system. Prior research has
developed a variety of methods to decide identifiability of direct effects in a
latent projection framework, in which the confounding effects of the latent
variables are represented by correlation among noise terms. This approach is
effective when the confounding is sparse and effects only small subsets of the
observed variables. In contrast, the new latent-factor half-trek criterion
(LF-HTC) we develop in this paper operates on the original unprojected latent
variable model and is able to certify identifiability in settings, where some
latent variables may also have dense effects on many or even all of the
observables. Our LF-HTC is an effective sufficient criterion for rational
identifiability, under which the direct effects can be uniquely recovered as
rational functions of the joint covariance matrix of the observed random
variables. When restricting the search steps in LF-HTC to consider subsets of
latent variables of bounded size, the criterion can be verified in time that is
polynomial in the size of the graph.

have become a mainstay of NLP engineering pipelines. Recently, with the release
of BERT, word embeddings have moved from the term-based embedding space to the
contextual embedding space -- each term is no longer represented by a single
low-dimensional vector but instead each term and \emph{its context} determine
the vector weights. BERT's setup and architecture have been shown to be general
enough to be applicable to many natural language tasks. Importantly for
Information Retrieval (IR), in contrast to prior deep learning solutions to IR
problems which required significant tuning of neural net architectures and
training regimes, ""vanilla BERT"" has been shown to outperform existing
retrieval algorithms by a wide margin, including on tasks and corpora that have
long resisted retrieval effectiveness gains over traditional IR baselines (such
as Robust04). In this paper, we employ the recently proposed axiomatic dataset
analysis technique -- that is, we create diagnostic datasets that each fulfil a
retrieval heuristic (both term matching and semantic-based) -- to explore what
BERT is able to learn. In contrast to our expectations, we find BERT, when
applied to a recently released large-scale web corpus with ad-hoc topics, to
\emph{not} adhere to any of the explored axioms. At the same time, BERT
outperforms the traditional query likelihood retrieval model by 40\%. This
means that the axiomatic approach to IR (and its extension of diagnostic
datasets created for retrieval heuristics) may in its current form not be
applicable to large-scale corpora. Additional -- different -- axioms are
needed.

line. SA delivers information about the angular size and structure of the
Pa$\alpha$ broad-line region (BLR), while RM delivers information about the
physical size and structure of the H$\beta$ BLR. Based on the fact that the two
BLRs share the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and viewing
inclination, a combination of SA and velocity-resolved RM (SARM) thereby allows
us to simultaneously determine the SMBH mass and geometric distance through
dynamically modeling the two BLRs. We construct a suite of dynamical models
with different geometric configurations and apply a Bayesian approach to obtain
the parameter inferences. Overall the obtained masses and distances are
insensitive to specific BLR configurations but more or less depend on
parameterizations of the vertical distributions. The most probable model,
chosen in light of the Bayes factor, yields an angular-size distance of
$\log\,(D_{\rm A}/{\rm Mpc}) = 2.83_{-0.28}^{+0.32}$ and SMBH mass of
$\log\,(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=9.06_{-0.27}^{+0.21}$, which agrees with the
relationships between SMBH masses and bulge properties. The BLRs have an
inclination of $5_{-1}^{+1}$ degrees, consistent with that of the large-scale
jet in 3C 273. Our approach reinforces the capability of SARM analysis to
measure SMBH mass and distance of AGNs even though SA and RM observations are
undertaken with different emission lines and/or in different periods.

literature. Legal core ontologies have been proposed to systematize concepts
and relationships relevant to normative reasoning. However, no solution amongst
those has achieved general acceptance, and no common ground (representational,
computational) has been identified enabling us to easily compare them. Yet, all
these efforts share the same motivation of representing normative directives,
therefore it is plausible that there may be a representational model
encompassing all of them. This presentation will introduce DPCL, a
domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying higher-level policies (including
norms, contracts, etc.), centred on Hohfeld's framework of fundamental legal
concepts. DPCL has to be seen primarily as a ""template"", i.e. as an
informational model for architectural reference, rather than a fully-fledged
formal language; it aims to make explicit the general requirements that should
be expected in a language for norm specification. In this respect, it goes
rather in the direction of legal core ontologies, but differently from those,
our proposal aims to keep the character of a DSL, rather than a set of axioms
in a logical framework: it is meant to be cross-compiled to underlying
languages/tools adequate to the type of target application. We provide here an
overview of some of the language features.

We show that it reduces the per-step memory and time complexity to constant,

in the number of competition rounds and has been extended to the
multidimensional Elo ratings for handling intransitive games. We empirically
demonstrate that our method achieves superior convergence speed and time

above 950 K drove a structural rearrangement resulting in 2D-VDW; this

revealed the co-existence of amorphous and incommensurate crystalline 2D

  sensitivity analysis of modeling approaches",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Power-to-Gas (P2G) has been one of the most frequently discussed technologies
in the last few years. This technology allows producing CO2 free fuels. Thanks
to its high flexibility, it may offer services to the power system, fostering
Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES) and the electricity demand match,
mitigating the issues related to VRES overproduction. The role of P2G plants
connected to the transmission system as flexibility asset has been extensively
analyzed in the literature. Conversely, the analysis of these systems used at
distribution level has only been dealt with in a few studies: however, in this
case critical operation conditions can easily arise, both on electrical and gas
infrastructure. This article presents a methodological analysis on the impact
of different simulation approaches when P2G is installed at distribution system
level. The choice of the most appropriate modeling approaches for electricity
and distribution grids is required in order to avoid overestimating or
underestimating the potential flexibility that P2G plants connected to
distribution networks can offer. The aim of this paper is to understand the
impact of different modeling approaches in order to determine whether, and
under which conditions, this is acceptable. An illustrative case study has been
developed to perform this kind of analysis. The results demonstrated that it is
important to take into account the electric distribution network topology, as
the performance of P2G plants could be affected by their placement in the
network. Neglecting the dynamics of a gas network or the interactions between
P2G plant components under a low gas demand condition can lead to an
underestimation of the flexibility of the entire system. If the demand for gas
is high enough, the use of simplified assumptions that do not consider the
dynamics of the gas network and P2G systems may be acceptable.

High-strength Al-alloys often used in aircrafts could help reduce the weight of

""embrittlement"" is often pointed as the main culprit, however, the mechanisms
underpinning failure are elusive: atomic-scale analysis of H inside an alloy
remains a challenge, and this prevents deploying alloy design strategies to
enhance the materials' durability. Here we successfully performed near-atomic
scale analysis of H trapped in second-phase particles and at grain boundaries
in a high-strength 7xxx Al-alloy. We used these observations to guide atomistic
ab-initio calculations which show that the co-segregation of alloying elements
and H favours grain boundary decohesion, while the strong partitioning of H
into the second-phases removes solute H from the matrix, hence preventing
H-embrittlement. Our insights further advance the mechanistic understanding of
H-assisted embrittlement in Al-alloys, emphasizing the role of H-traps in
retarding cracking and guiding new alloy design.

in which the $J/\psi$ energy spectrum is expressed in a form of perturbatively
calculable short-distance hard parts convoluted with one-dimensional soft gluon

kinematic effect can be naturally resummed in this approach. Short-distance
hard parts have been calculated analytically to next-to-leading order in
$\alpha_s$. Renormalization group equations for SGDs have been derived and
solved, which resums Sudakov logarithms originated from soft gluon emissions.
Our final result gives a upper bound for color-octet matrix elements consistent
with that extracted from hadron colliders. This may relieve the well-known
universality problem in the NRQCD factorization.
  As a comparison, we also analytically calculated short-distance hard parts in
the NRQCD factorization, with Sudakov logarithms resummed by using soft
collinear effective theory. The comparison shows that velocity corrections from
kinematic effect, which have been resummed in SGF, are significant for
phenomenological study. Furthermore, it is found that Sudakov logarithms
originated from soft gluon emissions are very important, while it is not the
case for Sudakov logarithms originated from jet function. Therefore, the
partial Sudakov resummation in SGF has already captured the main physics.

ability to segment the surroundings online into moving and non-moving objects
is a central ingredient for this task. Often, deep learning-based methods are
used to perform moving object segmentation (MOS). The performance of these
networks, however, strongly depends on the diversity and amount of labeled
training data, information that may be costly to obtain. In this paper, we
propose an automatic data labeling pipeline for 3D LiDAR data to save the
extensive manual labeling effort and to improve the performance of existing
learning-based MOS systems by automatically generating labeled training data.
Our proposed approach achieves this by processing the data offline in batches.
It first exploits an occupancy-based dynamic object removal to detect possible
dynamic objects coarsely. Second, it extracts segments among the proposals and
tracks them using a Kalman filter. Based on the tracked trajectories, it labels
the actually moving objects such as driving cars and pedestrians as moving. In
contrast, the non-moving objects, e.g., parked cars, lamps, roads, or
buildings, are labeled as static. We show that this approach allows us to label
LiDAR data highly effectively and compare our results to those of other label
generation methods. We also train a deep neural network with our auto-generated
labels and achieve similar performance compared to the one trained with manual
labels on the same data, and an even better performance when using additional
datasets with labels generated by our approach. Furthermore, we evaluate our
method on multiple datasets using different sensors and our experiments
indicate that our method can generate labels in diverse environments.

alter their static gas-phase properties. Recently, neural network potentials
(NNPs) trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data have become increasingly
popular to simulate molecular phenomena in condensed phase with an accuracy
comparable to ab initio methods. To date, most applications have centered on
solid-state materials or fairly simple molecules made of a limited number of
elements. Herein, we focus on the persistence and strength of chalcogen bonds
involving a benzotelluradiazole in condensed phase. While the
tellurium-containing heteroaromatic molecules are known to exhibit pronounced
interactions with anions and lone pairs of different atoms, the relevance of
competing intermolecular interactions, notably with the solvent, is complicated
to monitor experimentally but also challenging to model at an accurate
electronic structure level. Here, we train direct and baselined NNPs to
reproduce hybrid DFT energies and forces in order to identify what are the most
prevalent non-covalent interactions occurring in a solute-Cl$^-$-THF mixture.
The simulations in explicit solvent highlight the clear competition with
chalcogen bonds formed with the solvent and the short-range directionality of
the interaction with direct consequences for the molecular properties in the
solution. The comparison with other potentials (e.g., AMOEBA, direct NNP and
continuum solvent model) also demonstrates that baselined NNPs offer a reliable

is possible to address the accelerated expansion of the Hubble flow at various

non-locality corrections to the gravitational Lagrangian. On the other hand, it
is possible to search for gravitational non-local effects also at astrophysical

such as codified by arrow pushing. We propose an approach for representing such
mechanisms using graph transformation. In this framework, each elementary step
is a rule for modifying a molecular graph and a mechanism is a sequence of such
rules. To generate a compact representation of a multi-step reaction, we
compose the rules of individual steps into a composite rule, providing a
rigorous and fully automated approach to coarse-graining. While the composite
rule retains the graphical conditions necessary for the execution of a
mechanism, it also records information about transient changes not visible by
comparing educts and products. By projecting the rule onto a single ""overlay
graph"", we generalize Fujita's idea of an Imaginary Transition Structure from
elementary reactions to composite reactions. The utility of the overlay graph
construct is exemplified in the context of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In a
first application, we exploit mechanistic information in the Mechanism and
Catalytic Site Atlas to construct overlay graphs of hydrolase reactions listed
in the database. These graphs point at a spectrum of catalytic entanglement of
enzyme and substrate, de-emphasizing the notion of a singular catalyst in favor
of a collection of catalytic sites that can be distributed across enzyme and
substrate. In a second application, we deploy composite rules to search the
Rhea database for reactions of known or unknown mechanism that are, in
principle, compatible with the mechanisms implied by the composite rules. We
believe this work adds to the utility of graph-transformation formalisms in
representing and reasoning about chemistry in an automated yet insightful
fashion.

assumed to be composed of a mixture of H2S ice and photochemical haze; 2) a
layer of photochemical haze/ice, coincident with a layer of high static
stability at the methane condensation level at 1-2 bar; and 3) an extended
layer of photochemical haze, likely mostly of the same composition as the
1-2-bar layer, extending from this level up through to the stratosphere, where
the photochemical haze particles are thought to be produced. For Neptune, we
find that we also need to add a thin layer of micron-sized methane ice
particles at ~0.2 bar to explain the enhanced reflection at longer
methane-absorbing wavelengths. We suggest that methane condensing onto the haze
particles at the base of the 1-2-bar aerosol layer forms ice/haze particles
that grow very quickly to large size and immediately 'snow out' (as predicted
by Carlson et al. 1988), re-evaporating at deeper levels to release their core
haze particles to act as condensation nuclei for H2S ice formation. In
addition, we find that the spectral characteristics of 'dark spots', such as
the Voyager-2/ISS Great Dark Spot and the HST/WFC3 NDS-2018, are well modelled
by a darkening or possibly clearing of the deep aerosol layer only.

Jupiter WASP-189 b, $R_p=1.600^{+0.017}_{-0.016}\,R_J$, with a precision of 1%,

also find that the eclipse depth can only be explained by thermal emission

attribute the photometric variability to the stellar rotation, either through
superficial inhomogeneities or resonance couplings between the convective core

In junctions with a strong spin-orbit coupling, states with negative

and meson-field term (proposed by Csernai, Kapusta and Welle) to the global

maximum is reached at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3 GeV, if the measurements are

sensitive to interplay of the aforementioned contributions. In particular, the
thermal vorticity results in quite strong increase of the polarization from the
midrapidity to forward/backward rapidities, while the meson-field contribution
considerably flattens the rapidity dependence. The polarization turns out to be
very sensitive to details of the equation of state. While collision dynamics
become less equilibrium with decreasing collision energy, the present approach

baryons may scatter through a pure momentum exchange process, leaving the
background evolution unaffected. Earlier work has shown that, even for
barn-scale cross-sections, the imprints of this scattering process on linear
cosmological observables is too tiny to be observed. We therefore turn our
attention to non-linear scales, and for the first time investigate the
signatures of DE-baryon scattering on the non-linear formation of cosmic
structures, by running a suite of large N-body simulations. The observables we
extract include the non-linear matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and
density and baryon fraction profiles of halos. We find that in the non-linear
regime the signatures of DE-baryon scattering are significantly larger than
their linear counterparts, due to the important role of angular momentum in
collapsing structures, and potentially observable. The most promising
observables in this sense are the baryon density and baryon fraction profiles
of halos, which can potentially be constrained by a combination of kinetic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ), thermal SZ, and weak lensing measurements. Overall, our
results indicate that future prospects for cosmological and astrophysical
direct detection of non-gravitational signatures of dark energy are extremely
bright.

technologies such as bioremediation, biomineralization or enhanced oil
recovery. While physicochemical bacteria filtration is well-documented, recent
studies showed that bacterial motility plays a key role in the transport
process. Flow and transport experiments performed in microfluidic chips
containing randomly placed obstacles confirmed that the distributions of
non-motile particles stays compact, whereas for the motile strains, the
distributions are characterized by both significant retention as well as fast
downstream motion. For motile bacteria, the detailed microscopic study of
individual bacteria trajectories reveals two salient features: (i) the
emergence of an active retention process triggered by motility, (ii)
enhancement of dispersion due to the exchange between fast flow channels and
low flow regions in the vicinity of the solid grains. We propose a physical
model based on a continuous time random walk approach. This approach accounts
for bacteria dispersion via variable pore-scale flow velocities through a
Markov model for equidistant particle speeds. Motility of bacteria is modeled
by a two-rate trapping process that accounts for the motion towards and active
trapping at the obstacles. This approach captures the forward tails observed
for the distribution of bacteria displacements, and quantifies an enhanced
hydrodynamic dispersion effect that originates in the interaction between flow
at the pore-scale and bacterial motility. The model reproduces the experimental
observations, and predicts bacteria dispersion and transport at the macroscale.

the standard model of cosmology, the nature of this dark energy is still
unknown. We will discuss an alternative gravity model in which this dark energy
contribution emerges naturally, as a result of allowing for a time-dependence
on the gravitational constant, $G$, in Einstein's field equations. With this
modification, Bianchi's identities require an additional tensor field to be
introduced so that the usual conservation equation for matter and radiation is
satisfied. The equation of state of this tensor field is obtained using
additional constraints, coming from the assumption that this tensor field
represents the space-time response to the variation of $G$. We will also
present the predictions of this model for the late-universe data, and show that
the energy contribution of this new tensor is able to explain the accelerated
expansion of the universe without the addition of a cosmological constant.
Unlike many other alternative gravities with varying gravitational strength,
the predicted $G$ evolution is also consistent with local observations and
therefore this model does not require screening. We will finish by discussing
possible other implications this approach might have for cosmology and some

includes symptoms like tremors and rigidity. The current diagnostic procedure
uses patient assessments to evaluate symptoms and sometimes a magnetic
resonance imaging or MRI scan. However, symptom variations cause inaccurate
assessments, and the analysis of MRI scans requires experienced specialists.
This research proposes to accurately diagnose PD severity with deep learning by
combining symptoms data and MRI data from the Parkinsons Progression Markers
Initiative database. A new hybrid model architecture was implemented to fully
utilize both forms of clinical data, and models based on only symptoms and only
MRI scans were also developed. The symptoms based model integrates a fully
connected deep learning neural network, and the MRI scans and hybrid models
integrate transfer learning based convolutional neural networks. Instead of
performing only binary classification, all models diagnose patients into five
severity categories, with stage zero representing healthy patients and stages
four and five representing patients with PD. The symptoms only, MRI scans only,
and hybrid models achieved accuracies of 0.77, 0.68, and 0.94, respectively.
The hybrid model also had high precision and recall scores of 0.94 and 0.95.
Real clinical cases confirm the strong performance of the hybrid, where
patients were classified incorrectly with both other models but correctly by
the hybrid. It is also consistent across the five severity stages, indicating
accurate early detection. This is the first report to combine symptoms data and
MRI scans with a machine learning approach on such a large scale.

could be placed behind the star of arrival and along the star-Sun line, thus

compositional space. A conventional framework employing traditional ML
classification algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) coupled with appropriate
features including geometry-driven and key structural modes leads to highly
accurate prediction (~98%) of A-site cation ordering. We have evaluated the
accuracy of ML models by entailing analyses of decision paths, assignments of
probabilistic confidence bound, and finally introducing a direct non-Gaussian
acyclic structural equation model to investigate causality. Our study suggests
that the structural modes are the most important features for classifying
layered, columnar and rock-salt ordering. For clear layered ordering, the
charge difference between the A and A' is the most important feature which in
turn depends on the B, B' charge separation. Based on the outputs from ML
models, we have designed functional forms with these features to derive energy
differences forming clear layered ordering. The trilinear coupling between
tilt, rotation, and A-site antiferroelectric displacement in Landau free-energy
expansion becomes the necessary condition behind the formation of A-site cation
ordering.

that are spatially separated by ~7 arcsec. The small separation between these
sources has, in the past, resulted in confusion about the origin of the
emission from the combined region. We present long-term optical and X-ray
monitoring results of both sources, where we study the historic and recent
behaviour. In particular, from data collected as part of the S-CUBED project we
see repeating X-ray outbursts from the combined region of the two sources in
the recent lightcurve from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and we
investigate the origin of this emission. Using the H-alpha emission line from
the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and photometric flux from the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) to study the changes in the
size and structure of the Be disc, we demonstrate that the X-ray emission
likely originates from SXP 15.3. Timing analysis reveals unusual behaviour,
where the optical outburst profile shows modulation at twice the frequency of
the X-ray outbursts. We consider either of these periodicities being the true
orbital period in SXP 15.3 and propose models based on the geometric
orientations of the Be disc and neutron star to explain the physical origin of
the outbursts.

undesirable, but in non-linear systems a moderate amount of noise can improve
the system's performance and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The phenomenon
of stochastic resonance combines randomness with non-linearity and is a natural

execute the filtering and adaptation procedures in frequency domain with the
overlap-save method. A FDEFLN-based nonlinear active noise control (NANC)
system has also been developed to form the frequency domain exponential

and accurate solving the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE), and can
enable the optical system design, digital signal processing verification and
fast waveform calculation. Traditional waveform modeling of full-time and
full-frequency information is the split-step Fourier method (SSFM), which has
long been regarded as challenging in long-haul wavelength division multiplexing
(WDM) optical fiber communication systems because it is extremely
time-consuming. Here we propose a linear-nonlinear feature decoupling
distributed (FDD) waveform modeling scheme to model long-haul WDM fiber
channel, where the channel linear effects are modelled by the NLSE-derived
model-driven methods and the nonlinear effects are modelled by the data-driven
deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme only focuses on one-span
fiber distance fitting, and then recursively transmits the model to achieve the
required transmission distance. The proposed modeling scheme is demonstrated to
have high accuracy, high computing speeds, and robust generalization abilities
for different optical launch powers, modulation formats, channel numbers and
transmission distances. The total running time of FDD waveform modeling scheme
for 41-channel 1040-km fiber transmission is only 3 minutes versus more than 2
hours using SSFM for each input condition, which achieves a 98% reduction in
computing time. Considering the multi-round optimization by adjusting system
parameters, the complexity reduction is significant. The results represent a
remarkable improvement in nonlinear fiber modeling and open up novel
perspectives for solution of NLSE-like partial differential equations and
optical fiber physics problems.

increase the variability and heterogeneity of the generated data by introducing
on-demand anomalies without additional effort or expert knowledge. We also
suggest the use of Kullback-Leibler Divergence and Mean Squared Error as new
metrics in the validation of synthetic time series generation, as they provide
a better overall comparison of multivariate data distributions. We validate our
approach using real data collected in an operating Data Center, successfully
generating synthetic data helpful for prediction and optimization models. Our
research will help optimize the energy consumed in Data Centers, although the
proposed methodology can be employed in any similar time-series-like problem.

data silos. It becomes difficult to move and work coherently with data as new
requirements emerge as no single framework can efficiently fulfill the data
management needs of diverse applications. A possible solution is to design
smart and efficient hierarchical (multi-tier) storage solutions. A hierarchical
storage system (HSS) is a meta solution that consists of different storage
frameworks organized as a jointly constructed large storage pool. It brings a
number of benefits including better utilization of the storage,
cost-efficiency, and use of different features provided by the underlying
storage frameworks. In order to maximize the gains of hierarchical storage
solutions, it is important that they include intelligent and autonomous
mechanisms for data management grounded in the features of the different
underlying frameworks. These decisions should be made according to the
characteristics of the dataset, tier status, and access patterns. These are
highly dynamic parameters and defining a policy based on the mentioned
parameters is a non-trivial task. This paper presents an open-source
hierarchical storage framework with a dynamic migration policy based on
reinforcement learning (RL). We present a mathematical model, a software
architecture, and an implementation based on both simulations and a live
cloud-based environment. We compare the proposed RL-based strategy to a
baseline of three rule-based policies, showing that the RL-based policy
achieves significantly higher efficiency and optimal data distribution in

preferred directions of strong crystalline symmetry (the so-called fibers).
Moreover, among the materials produced industrially, many are manufactured in
the form of sheets or of thin layers. This article has for object the study of
the magneto-mechanical coupling which is a function of the stress $\sigma$ and
the magnetization M. We consider a material with cubic symmetry whose texture
can be described by one of three fibers denoted as $\theta$, $\gamma$ or
$\alpha$ ' , and which is thin enough so that both the stress and the
magnetization can be considered as in-plane quantities. We propose an algorithm
able to derive linear relations between the 30 cubic invariants I k of a
minimal integrity basis describing a magneto-elastic problem, when they are
restricted to in-plane loading conditions and for different fiber orientations.
The algorithm/program output is a reduced list of invariants of cardinal 7 for
the {100}-oriented $\theta$ fiber, of cardinal 15 for the {110}-oriented
$\alpha$ ' fiber and of cardinal 8 for the {111}-oriented $\gamma$ fiber. This
reduction (compared to initial cardinal 30) can be of great help for the
