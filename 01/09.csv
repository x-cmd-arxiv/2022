action recognition task. Transformer shows great potential to model the
correlation of important joints. However, the existing Transformer-based
methods cannot capture the correlation of different joints between frames,
which the correlation is very useful since different body parts (such as the
arms and legs in ""long jump"") between adjacent frames move together. Focus on
this problem, A novel spatio-temporal tuples Transformer (STTFormer) method is
proposed. The skeleton sequence is divided into several parts, and several
consecutive frames contained in each part are encoded. And then a
spatio-temporal tuples self-attention module is proposed to capture the
relationship of different joints in consecutive frames. In addition, a feature
aggregation module is introduced between non-adjacent frames to enhance the
ability to distinguish similar actions. Compared with the state-of-the-art
methods, our method achieves better performance on two large-scale datasets.

first confirm the detection of the Tc lines, and then analyze its carbon and

replacement for SRAM technology in large Last-Level Caches (LLCs). Despite its
high-density, non-volatility, near-zero leakage power, and immunity to
radiation as the major advantages, STT-MRAM-based cache suffers from high error
rates mainly due to retention failure, read disturbance, and write failure.
Existing studies are limited to estimating the rate of only one or two of these
error types for STT-MRAM cache. However, the overall vulnerability of STT-MRAM
caches, which its estimation is a must to design cost-efficient reliable
caches, has not been offered in any of previous studies. In this paper, we
propose a system-level framework for reliability exploration and
characterization of errors behavior in STT-MRAM caches. To this end, we
formulate the cache vulnerability considering the inter-correlation of the
error types including all three errors as well as the dependency of error rates
to workloads behavior and Process Variations (PVs). Our analysis reveals that
STT-MRAM cache vulnerability is highly workload-dependent and varies by orders
of magnitude in different cache access patterns. Our analytical study also
shows that this vulnerability divergence significantly increases by process
variations in STT-MRAM cells. To evaluate the framework, we implement the error
types in the gem5 full-system simulator, and the experimental results show that
the total error rate in a shared LLC varies by 32.0x for different workloads. A
further 6.5x vulnerability variation is observed when considering PVs in the
STT-MRAM cells. In addition, the contribution of each error type in total LLC
vulnerability highly varies in different cache access patterns and moreover,
error rates are differently affected by PVs.

multiple control and diagnostics functions; consequently, the time available
for CG computations is limited and may vary over time. To address this issue, a
robust to early termination command governor is developed which embeds the
solution of a CG problem into the internal states of a virtual continuous-time
dynamical system which runs in parallel to the process. This virtual system is
built so that its trajectory converges to the optimal solution (with a tunable
convergence rate), and provides a sub-optimal but feasible solution whenever
its evolution is terminated. This allows the designer to implement a CG
strategy with a small sampling period (and consequently with a minimum
degradation in its performance), while maintaining its constraint-handling
capabilities. Simulations are carried out to assess the effectiveness of the
developed scheme in satisfying performance requirements and real-time
schedulability conditions for a practical vehicle rollover example.

function applied to the linearized GK Boltzmann equation, yielding a hierarchy
of coupled equations for the expansion coefficients, referred to as
gyro-moments. We explore analytically the collisionless and high-collisional
limits of the gyro-moment hierarchy. Parameter scans revealing the dependence
of the ITG growth rate on the collisionality are reported, showing strong
damping at small scales as the collisionality increases. These properties are
compared with the predictions based on the Sugama, the momentum-conserving
pitch-angle scattering, the Hirshman- Sigmar-Clarke, and the Daugherty
collision operators. The importance of finite Larmor radius (FLR) terms in the
collision operators is pointed out by the appearance of a short wavelength (SW)
ITG branch when collisional FLR terms are neglected, this branch being
completely suppressed by collisional FLR effects. We demonstrate that energy
diffusion is important at high collisionality and small scale lengths and that,
among the collision operators considered in this work, the GK Sugama collision
operator yields, in general, the smallest deviation on the ITG growth rate

researchers in tinyML have considered machine learning algorithms that can
train and run a deep neural network (DNN) on a low-end device using integer
operations only. In this paper we propose PocketNN, a light and self-contained
proof-of-concept framework in pure C++ for the training and inference of DNNs
using only integers. Unlike other approaches, PocketNN directly operates on
integers without requiring any explicit quantization algorithms or customized
fixed-point formats. This was made possible by pocket activations, which are a
family of activation functions devised for integer-only DNNs, and an emerging
DNN training algorithm called direct feedback alignment (DFA). Unlike the
standard backpropagation (BP), DFA trains each layer independently, thus
avoiding integer overflow which is a key problem when using BP with
integer-only operations. We used PocketNN to train some DNNs on two well-known
datasets, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. Our experiments show that the DNNs trained
with our PocketNN achieved 96.98% and 87.7% accuracies on MNIST and
Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. The accuracies are very close to the
equivalent DNNs trained using BP with floating-point real number operations,
such that accuracy degradations were just 1.02%p and 2.09%p, respectively.
Finally, our PocketNN has high compatibility and portability for low-end
devices as it is open source and implemented in pure C++ without any

Well known randomization based countermeasures are effective means against

In this paper we investigate how the formula used to implement the

different partial multipliers, i.e. based on different multiplication formulae.
We used two different technologies, i.e. a 130 and a 250 nm technology, to
simulate power traces for our analysis. We show that the implemented

significantly, but we also learned that its impact differs from technology to

formulae as the single countermeasure is not sufficient to protect
cryptographic designs against horizontal DPA attacks.

architecture is based on silicon nanowire split-gate transistors which can form
finite 1d chains of spin-qubits and allow the execution of two-qubit operations
such as Swap gates among neighbors. Adding to this, we describe a novel silicon
junction which can couple up to four nanowires into 2d arrangements via spin
shuttling and Swap operations. Given these hardware elements, we propose a
modular sparse 2d spin-qubit architecture with unit cells consisting of
diagonally-oriented squares with nanowires along the edges and junctions on the

outperform the best-in-class compilation strategy for 1d chains, not only
asymptotically, but also down to the minimal structure of a single square. The
proposed architecture exhibits favorable scaling properties which allow for
balancing the trade-off between compilation overhead and co-location of
classical control electronics within each square by adjusting the length of the
nanowires. An appealing feature of the proposed architecture is its
manufacturability using complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)

deaths. Common countermeasures to contain the epidemic spread include
introducing restrictions on human interactions or their mobility in general
which are often associated with an economic and social cost. In this paper, we
present a targeted model of optimal social distancing on metapopulation
networks, named ESIR model, which can effectively reduce the disease spreading
and at the same time minimize the impact on human mobility and related costs.
The proposed model is grounded in a nonlinear random walk process that
considers the finite carrying capacity of the network's metanodes, the physical
patches where individuals interact within mobility networks. This later
constrain is modeled as a slack compartment E for the classic SIR model and
quantifies the density of vacant spaces to accommodate the diffusing
individuals. Formulating the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem
shows that when the walkers avoid crowded nodes, the system can rapidly
approach Pareto optimality, thus reducing the spreading considerably while
minimzing the impact on human mobility as also validated in empirical transport
networks. These results envisage ad hoc mobility protocols that can potentially
enhance policy making for pandemic control.

Blohmann, Fernandes, and Weinstein over a much larger extension.) The

an $L_\infty$-algebroid over a graded manifold which extends the initial data.

different GBs. Three-dimensional atom probe tomography results revealed that GB
solute concentration of Nd in Mg varies between 2 to 5 at.%. This variation was
not only seen for different GB orientations but also within the GB plane.
Correlated atomistic simulations suggest that the inhomogeneous segregation
behavior observed experimentally stems from local atomic rearrangements within
the GBs and introduce the notion of potential excess free volume in the context
of improving the prediction of per-site segregation energies.

amounts of spatially referenced crop image data. In large-scale experiments,
however, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a
complex canopy architecture. Especially for the observation of temporal
effects, this complicates the recognition of individual plants over several
images and the extraction of relevant information tremendously. In this work,
we present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial
identification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as
""cataloging"" based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the
workflow on two real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of
Cercospora leaf spot - a fungal disease - in sugar beet over an entire growing
cycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The
plant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over
multiple time points. This gathers large-scale spatio-temporal image dataset
that in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including
various data layers. The presented approach improves analysis and
interpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly. By validation with
some reference data, our method shows an accuracy that is similar to more
complex deep learning-based recognition techniques. Our workflow is able to
automatize plant cataloging and training image extraction, especially for large

individual finger will differ with respect to the size and shape of a grasped
object. In this work, we report its use in statistically differentiating
stationary objects of spherical and cylindrical shapes of varying radii

embedded glove system, we explored the practicability of object classification
based on the tactile sensor responses from each finger of the smart glove. An
estimated standard error of the mean was calculated from each of the of five
fingers averaged flex sensor readings. Consistent with the literature, we found
that there is a systematic dependence between an objects shape, dimension and
the flex sensor readings. The sensor output from at least one finger, indicated
a non-overlapping confidence interval when comparing spherical and cylindrical
objects of the same radius. When sensing spheres and cylinders of varying
sizes, all five fingers had a categorically varying reaction to each shape. We
believe that our findings could be used in machine learning models for
real-time object identification.

shows that the normalized cross helicity decreases inside the plasma sheet

of transverse kinetic energy with respect to magnetic energy in a spherically

recently introduced by considering a specific family of time-dependent Bregman

the minimizer of the given convex function at an arbitrary accelerated rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/t^p)$. This framework has been exploited using time-adaptive
geometric integrators to design efficient explicit algorithms for symplectic
accelerated optimization. It was observed that geometric discretizations were
substantially less prone to stability issues, and were therefore more robust,
reliable, and computationally efficient. More recently, this variational
framework has been extended to the Riemannian manifold setting by considering a
more general family of time-dependent Bregman Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
systems on Riemannian manifolds. It is thus natural to develop time-adaptive
Hamiltonian variational integrators for accelerated optimization on Riemannian

constructed with holonomic constraints, but the resulting algorithms were
implicit in nature, which significantly increased their cost per iteration. In

maintain a large matching after each edge update. This problem has received
considerable attention in recent years. The known algorithms naturally exhibit
a trade-off between the quality of the matching maintained (i.e., the
approximation ratio) and the time needed per update. While several interesting
results have been obtained, the optimal behavior of this trade-off remains
largely unclear. Our main contribution is a new approach to designing fully
dynamic approximate matching algorithms that in a unified manner not only
(essentially) recovers all previously known trade-offs that were achieved via
very different techniques, but reveals some new ones as well. As our main tool
to achieve this, we introduce a generalization of the edge-degree constrained
subgraph (EDCS) of Bernstein and Stein (2015) that we call the hierarchical
EDCS (HEDCS).

with an improved fractional-order extended state observer (IFO-ESO).Based on
the new ADRC scheme, the open-loop transfer function of a high-order system can
be approximately rendered to a so-called Weighed Bode's ideal transfer
function, whose closed-loop performance is less prone to the controller
parameter variations. The design of the IFO-ESO helps reduce the number of
system states to be estimated and improves the performance of closed-loop
system over %the previously proposed the fractional-order active disturbance
rejection control (FO-ADRC) in the literature. Compared with the integer-order
active disturbance rejection controller (IO-ADRC) and FO-ADRC, the auxiliary
tracking controller of IFO-ADRC has a simpler form. Frequency-domain analysis
shows that IFO-ESO has better estimation performance than fractional-order ESO,
and time-domain simulation demonstrates that the proposed ADRC has better
transient performance and is more robust against the parameter variations than
FO-ADRC and IO-ADRC. The proposed ADRC is applied to permanent magnet
synchronous motor (PMSM) servo control system and demonstrates its capability

repeatedly from the same source region, and how these homologous eruptions are
initiated remains an open question. Here, by using a new magnetohydrodynamic
simulation, we show that homologous solar eruptions can be efficiently produced
by recurring formation and disruption of coronal current sheet as driven by
continuously shearing of the same polarity inversion line within a single
bipolar configuration. These eruptions are initiated by the same mechanism, in
which an internal current sheet forms slowly in a gradually sheared bipolar
field and reconnection of the current sheet triggers and drives the eruption.
Each of the eruptions does not release all the free energy but with a large
amount left in the post-flare arcade below the erupting flux rope. Thus, a new
current sheet can be more easily formed by further shearing of the post-flare
arcade than by shearing a potential field arcade, and this is favorable for
producing the next eruption. Furthermore, it is found that the new eruption is
stronger since the newly formed current sheet has a larger current density and
a lower height. In addition, our results also indicate the existence of a
magnetic energy threshold for a given flux distribution, and eruption occurs
once this threshold is approached.

LEO satellite communication system, by utilizing the controllable phase shifts
of massive passive reflecting elements to achieve flexible beamforming, which
copes with the time-varying channel between the high-mobility satellite (SAT)
and ground node (GN) cost-effectively. In particular, we propose a new
architecture for IRS-aided LEO satellite communication where IRSs are deployed
at both sides of the SAT and GN, and study their cooperative passive
beamforming (CPB) design over line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant single-reflection
and double-reflection channels. Specifically, we jointly optimize the active
transmit/receive beamforming at the SAT/GN as well as the CPB at two-sided IRSs
to maximize the overall channel gain from the SAT to each GN. Interestingly, we
show that under LoS channel conditions, the high-dimensional SAT-GN channel can
be decomposed into the outer product of two low-dimensional vectors. By
exploiting the decomposed SAT-GN channel, we decouple the original beamforming
optimization problem into two simpler subproblems corresponding to the SAT and
GN sides, respectively, which are both solved in closed-form. Furthermore, we
propose an efficient transmission protocol to conduct channel estimation and
beam tracking, which only requires independent processing of the SAT and GN in
a distributed manner, thus substantially reducing the implementation
complexity. Simulation results validate the performance advantages of the
proposed IRS-aided LEO satellite communication system with two-sided
cooperative IRSs, as compared to various baseline schemes such as the
conventional reflect-array and one-sided IRS.

linear programming relaxations of packing integer programs, i.e.,
$\max\{w^Tx:x\in P\cap\{0,1\}^n\}$ where $P=\{x\in[0,1]^n:Ax \leq b\}$ and
$A,b,w\ge0$. The $t^{th}$ level $P^{t}$ corresponds to adding cuts associated
with the integer hull of the intersection of any $t$ knapsack constraints (rows
of the constraint matrix). This model captures the maximum possible strength of
""$t$-row cuts"", an approach often used by solvers for small $t$. If $A$ is $m
\times n$, then $P^m$ is the integer hull of $P$ and $P^1$ corresponds to
adding cuts for each associated single-row knapsack problem. Thus, even
separating over $P^1$ is NP-hard. However, for fixed $t$ and any $\epsilon>0$,
results of Pritchard imply there is a polytime $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for
$P^{t}$. We then investigate the hierarchy's strength in the context of the
well-studied all-or-nothing flow problem in trees (also called unsplittable
flow on trees). For this problem, we show that the integrality gap of $P^t$ is
$O(n/t)$ and give examples where the gap is $\Omega(n/t)$. We then examine the
stronger formulation $P_{\text{rank}}$ where all rank constraints are added.
For $P_{\text{rank}}^t$, our best lower bound drops to $\Omega(1/c)$ at level
$t=n^c$ for any $c>0$. Moreover, on a well-known class of ""bad instances"" due
to Friggstad and Gao, we show that we can achieve this gap; hence a constant
integrality gap for these instances is obtained at level $n^c$.

of an $s$-wave superconductor and a TI nanowire. We show that there is a
distinct phenomenology arising from the metallization of states in the TI
nanowire by the superconductor. In the strong coupling limit, required to
induce a large superconducting pairing potential, we find that metallization
results in a shift of the TI nanowire subbands ($\sim 20$ meV) as well as it
leads to a small reduction in the size of the subband gap opened by a magnetic
field applied parallel to the nanowire axis. Surprisingly, we find that
metallization effects in TI nanowires can also be beneficial. Most notably,
coupling to the superconductor induces a potential in the portion of the TI
nanowire close to the interface with the superconductor, this breaks inversion
symmetry and at finite momentum lifts the spin degeneracy of states within a
subband. As such coupling to a superconductor can create or enhance the subband
splitting that is key to achieving topological superconductivity. This is in
stark contrast to semiconductors, where it has been shown that metallization
effects always reduce the equivalent subband-splitting caused by spin-orbit
coupling. We also find that in certain geometries metallization effects can
reduce the critical magnetic required to enter the topological phase. We
conclude that, unlike in semiconductors, the metallization effects that occur
in TI nanowires can be relatively easily mitigated, for instance by modifying
the geometry of the attached superconductor or by compensation of the TI
material.

for Schwarzschild and Kerr type spacetimes is based on splitting and
composition methods for numerical integrations of Hamiltonians or
time-transformed Hamiltonians associated with these spacetimes. Such splittings
are not unique but have various choices. A Hamiltonian describing the motion of
charged particles around the Schwarzschild black hole with an external magnetic
field can be separated into three, four and five explicitly integrable parts.
It is shown through numerical tests of regular and chaotic orbits that the
three-part splitting method is the best one of the three Hamiltonian splitting
methods in accuracy. In the three-part splitting, optimized fourth-order
partitioned Runge-Kutta and Runge-Kutta-Nystr\""{o}m explicit symplectic
integrators exhibit the best accuracies. In fact, they are several orders of
magnitude better than the fourth-order Yoshida algorithms for appropriate time
steps. The former algorithms need small additional computational cost compared
with the latter ones. Optimized sixth-order partitioned Runge-Kutta and
Runge-Kutta-Nystr\""{o}m explicit symplectic integrators have no dramatic
advantages over the optimized fourth-order ones in accuracies during long-term
integrations due to roundoff errors. The idea finding the integrators with the
best performance is also suitable for Hamiltonians or time-transformed
Hamiltonians of other curved spacetimes including the Kerr type spacetimes.
When the numbers of explicitly integrable splitting sub-Hamiltonians are as
small as possible, such splitting Hamiltonian methods would bring better
accuracies. In this case, the optimized fourth-order partitioned Runge-Kutta

have been proposed recently. In this letter, a novel joint source-channel

proposed to improve the decoding performance of the D-Polar codes. We merge the
trellis of the source polar code and that of the channel polar code to
construct a compound trellis. In this compound trellis, the joint
source-channel nodes represent both of the information bits and the
high-entropy bits. Based on the compound trellis, the J-SCL decoder is designed
to recover the source messages by combining the source SCL decoding and channel
SCL decoding. The J-SCL decoder doubles the number of the decoding paths at
each decoding level and then reserves the L paths with the smallest joint
path-metric (JPM). For the JSC node, the JPM is updated considering both the
channel decision log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) and the source decision LLRs.
Simulation results show that the J-SCL decoder outperforms the turbo-like BP

Although effective, this way of working cannot handle design requirements that

due to the increasing popularity of product customization. In particular, there
is often a need for designing a new model out of an existing structural family
of models, which share a structural pattern but have individually varied detail
features. To facilitate such design requirements, a new method is presented in
this paper. The idea is to express the underlying structural pattern in terms
of a submodel composed of the maximum common design features of the family, and
then to build a single master model by attaching to the submodel all detail
design features in the family. This master model is a representative model for
the family and contains all the features. By removing unwanted detail features
and adding new features, the master model can be easily adapted into a new
design, while keeping aligned with the family, structurally. Effectiveness of
this method has been validated by a series of case studies and comparisons of

parameterizations of subgrid scale processes due to their limited spatial
resolution. Despite substantial progress in developing parameterization (or
closure) models for subgrid scale (SGS) processes using physical insights and
mathematical approximations, they remain imperfect and can lead to inaccurate
predictions. In recent years, machine learning has been successful in
extracting complex patterns from high-resolution spatio-temporal data, leading
to improved parameterization models, and ultimately better coarse grid
prediction. However, the inability to satisfy known physics and poor
generalization hinders the application of these models for real-world problems.
In this work, we propose a frame invariant closure approach to improve the
accuracy and generalizability of deep learning-based subgrid scale closure
models by embedding physical symmetries directly into the structure of the
neural network. Specifically, we utilized specialized layers within the
convolutional neural network in such a way that desired constraints are
theoretically guaranteed without the need for any regularization terms. We
demonstrate our framework for a two-dimensional decaying turbulence test case
mostly characterized by the forward enstrophy cascade. We show that our frame
invariant SGS model (i) accurately predicts the subgrid scale source term, (ii)
respects the physical symmetries such as translation, Galilean, and rotation
invariance, and (iii) is numerically stable when implemented in coarse-grid
simulation with generalization to different initial conditions and Reynolds
number. This work builds a bridge between extensive physics-based theories and
data-driven modeling paradigms, and thus represents a promising step towards
the development of physically consistent data-driven turbulence closure models.

fresh samples of a signal (source) are sent through an unreliable channel to a
remote estimator, and acknowledgments are sent back over a feedback channel.
Both the forward and feedback channels could have random transmission times due
to time varying channel conditions. Motivated by distributed sensing, the
estimator can estimate the real-time value of the source signal by combining
the signal samples received through the channel and the noisy signal
observations collected from a local sensor. We prove that the estimation error
is a non-decreasing function of the Age of Information (AoI) for the received
signal samples and design an optimal sampling strategy that minimizes the
long-term average estimation error subject to a sampling rate constraint. The
sampling strategy is also optimal for minimizing the long-term average of
general non-decreasing functions of the AoI. The optimal sampler design follows
a randomized threshold strategy: If the last transmission was successful, the
source waits until the expected estimation error upon delivery exceeds a
threshold and then sends out a new sample. If the last transmission fails, the
source immediately sends out a new sample without waiting. The threshold is the
root of a fixed-point equation and can be solved with low complexity (e.g., by
bisection search). The optimal sampling strategy holds for general transmission
time distributions of the forward and feedback channels. Numerical simulations
are provided to compare different sampling policies.

such a non-Hermitian system, when the energy bias between two levels is
adjusted very slowly, i.e., in the adiabatic limit, we find that a quantum
state can still closely follow the eigenstate solution until it encounters the
exceptional points (EPs) at which two eigenvalues and their corresponding
eigenvectors coalesce. In the absence of the nonlinear self-interaction, we can
obtain explicit expressions for the eigenvectors and eigenvalues and
analytically derive the adiabatic LZT probability from invariants at EPs. In
the presence of the nonlinear interaction, the dynamics of the adiabatic
evolutions are explicitly demonstrated with the help of classical trajectories
in the plane of the two canonical variables of the corresponding classical
Josephson Hamiltonian. We show that the adiabatic tunneling probabilities can
be precisely predicted by the classical action at EPs in the weak nonreciprocal
regime. In a certain region of strong nonreciprocity, we find that
interestingly, the nonlinear interaction effects can be completely suppressed
so that the adiabatic tunneling probabilities are identical to their linear
counterparts. We also obtain a phase diagram for large ranges of nonreciprocity
and nonlinear interaction parameters to explicitly demonstrate where the
adiabaticity can break down, i.e., the emergence of the nonzero tunneling
probabilities even in adiabatic limit.

superhumps (growing superhumps) was established. This method is a dynamical one
in that it relies only on celestial mechanics. It is not dependent on an
experimental calibration. Since then, more than 100 objects have been measured
by this method. In this paper, I provide an updated description of the method.
Comparisons with the results of the modern eclipse modeling method, which is
considered to be the golden standard, have shown that these two methods agree
very well and the stage A superhump method has been confirmed to be as accurate
and as reliable as the modern eclipse modeling method. The number of the object
by the former methods is now a few time those by the latter method, and the
former is indispensable to study the terminal evolution of cataclysmic
variables. I also showed that past studies by the other groups assumed
incorrect fractional superhump excess relations, causing biases in discussing
the evolution. I also derived a new experimental relation for stage B
superhumps. The updated evolutionary track around the period minimum suggests
that the angular momentum loss is 1.9 times larger than expected by
gravitational wave radiation. The measurements of stage A superhumps greatly
owe to international collaborations with amateurs and professionals. There is
similarity with the world of ornithology in that both play a role in uniting
the world via international exchanges of observations. I describe a summary of
these collaborations and describe my thoughts about the relation between
astronomy and ornithology, and give prospects how multidisciplinary works can
be made possible between these seemingly distant fields of science (abridged).

  review",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Full-waveform inversion (FWI), a popular technique that promises
high-resolution models, has helped in improving the salt definition in inverted
velocity models. The success of the inversion relies heavily on having prior
knowledge of the salt, and using advanced acquisition technology with long
offsets and low frequencies. Salt bodies are often constructed by recursively
picking the top and bottom of the salt from seismic images corresponding to
tomography models, combined with flooding techniques. The process is
time-consuming and highly prone to error, especially in picking the bottom of
the salt (BoS). Many studies suggest performing FWI with long offsets and low
frequencies after constructing the salt bodies to correct the miss-interpreted
boundaries. Here, we focus on detecting the BoS automatically by utilizing deep
learning tools. We specifically generate many random 1D models, containing or
free of salt bodies, and calculate the corresponding shot gathers. We then
apply FWI starting with salt flooded versions of those models, and the results
of the FWI become inputs to the neural network, whereas the corresponding true
1D models are the output. The network is trained in a regression manner to
detect the BoS and estimate the subsalt velocity. We analyze three scenarios in
creating the training datasets and test their performance on the 2D BP 2004
salt model. We show that when the network succeeds in estimating the subsalt
velocity, the requirement of low frequencies and long offsets are somewhat
mitigated. In general, this work allows us to merge the top-to-bottom approach
with FWI, save the BoS picking time, and empower FWI to converge in the absence
of low frequencies and long offsets in the data.

recent years. As most of the existing works focus on linear models, it is
important to note that many problems in practice are nonlinear in nature and
therefore development of nonlinear regression tools for interval-valued data is
crucial. In this paper, we propose a tree-based regression method for
interval-valued data, which is well applicable to both linear and nonlinear
problems. Unlike linear regression models that usually require additional
constraints to ensure positivity of the predicted interval length, the proposed
method estimates the regression function in a nonparametric way, so the
predicted length is naturally positive without any constraints. A simulation
study is conducted that compares our method to popular existing regression
models for interval-valued data under both linear and nonlinear settings.
Furthermore, a real data example is presented where we apply our method to

groups videos into metaclasses considering several abstractions that represent
high-level structural properties of file metadata. This is followed by a more
nuanced classification of classes that comprise each metaclass. The method is
evaluated on more than 20K videos obtained by combining four public video
datasets. Tests show that a balanced accuracy of 91% is achieved in correctly
identifying the class of a video among 119 video classes. This corresponds to
an improvement of 6.5% over the conventional approach based on video file
encapsulation characteristics. Furthermore, we investigate a setting relevant
to forensic file recovery operations where file metadata cannot be located or

electrodes of varying apertures, to which a confining RF potential following a
rectangular waveform is applied. The thicknesses of the rings and the gaps in
between are varied accordingly to maximize the confining volume and to reduce
ion losses. Ion transport within the ion guide is facilitated by a
lower-frequency wave traveling on top of the higher-frequency confining field.

such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), as potential desalination membranes.
Here, we study the effect of grain boundaries (GBs) and interfacial
electrostatic interactions on the desalination performance of bicrystalline
nanoporous hBN, using classical molecular dynamics simulations supported by
quantum-mechanical density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We investigate
three different nanoporous bicrystalline hBN configurations, with symmetric
tilt GBs having misorientation angles of 13.2{\deg}, 21.8{\deg}, and
32.2{\deg}. We find that grain boundaries alter the areas and shapes of
nanopores in bicrystalline hBN, as compared to the nanopores in monocrystalline
hBN. We observe that, although bicrystalline nanoporous hBN with a
misorientation angle of 13.2{\deg} shows improved water flow rate by ~30%, it
demonstrates reduced Na$^\mathrm{+}$ ion rejection by ~6%, as compared to
monocrystalline hBN. We also uncover the role of the nanopore shape in water
desalination, finding that more elongated pores with smaller sizes (in
21.8{\deg}- and 32.2{\deg}-misoriented bicrystalline hBN) can match the water
permeation through less elongated pores of slightly larger sizes, with a
concomitant ~3-4% drop in Na$^\mathrm{+}$ rejection. Simulations also predict
that the water flow rate is significantly affected by interfacial electrostatic
interactions. Indeed, the water flow rate is the highest when altered partial
charges on B and N atoms were determined using DFT calculations, as compared to
when no partial charges or bulk partial charges (i.e., charged hBN) were
considered. Overall, our work on water/ion transport through nanopores in
bicrystalline hBN indicates that the presence of GBs and surface charge can
lead, respectively, to a drop in the ion rejection and water permeation
performance of hBN membranes.

obtained by solving the equation for evolution, and then we employ this

state-sampling techniques, to devise feasible nonlinear Hadamard gates and
thereby feasible, i.e., high-contrast, nonlinear Ramsey interferometry. Our

quantum tunneling for collective motions such as in sub-barrier fusion
reactions. As a first step toward a solution, a time-dependent model is
considered using a superposition of Gaussian wave packets, to describe the
relative motion between two colliding nuclei, which may be simplified to a
problem for one particle in one dimension. In this article, how the model
describes the potential-barrier transmission is investigated by paying
attention to the time evolution of the phase space distribution, which in
particular reveals that the behavior of the free propagation of the incoming
state is not trivial, depending on the number of superposed wave packets.
Passage over the barrier can occur due to the high-momentum components in the
incoming state corresponding to energies above the barrier height, which is,
however, of classical nature and needs to be distinguished from the true
quantum tunneling. Although a transmitted wave packet in some case may end up
with an energy lower than the barrier, a difficulty is noticed in guaranteeing
the energy conservation when the energies of different exit channels, e.g. of
transmission and reflection, are individually measured. To overcome these
issues for a description of quantum tunneling is still a challenging problem.
This article mainly treats the same system with the same model as in the paper
Phys. Lett. B 808 (2020) 135693, arXiv:2006.06944v1 by N. Hasegawa, K. Hagino
and Y. Tanimura. However, the conclusion of the present work disagrees with
their quick conclusion that quantum tunneling was simulated by the model.

inflexibility to support high-resolution images and limitations of local

multi-axis MLP based architecture called MAXIM, that can serve as an efficient
and flexible general-purpose vision backbone for image processing tasks. MAXIM
uses a UNet-shaped hierarchical structure and supports long-range interactions
enabled by spatially-gated MLPs. Specifically, MAXIM contains two MLP-based
building blocks: a multi-axis gated MLP that allows for efficient and scalable
spatial mixing of local and global visual cues, and a cross-gating block, an
alternative to cross-attention, which accounts for cross-feature conditioning.
Both these modules are exclusively based on MLPs, but also benefit from being
both global and `fully-convolutional', two properties that are desirable for
image processing. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed
MAXIM model achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than ten benchmarks

the players' cost functions may be subject to random fluctuations (e.g.,
weather disturbances, perturbations in the underlying network, etc.). We tackle
this problem from the viewpoint of a control interface that makes routing
recommendations based solely on observed costs and without any further
knowledge of the system's governing dynamics -- such as the network's cost
functions, the distribution of any random events affecting the network, etc. In
this online setting, learning methods based on the popular exponential weights
algorithm converge to equilibrium at an $\mathcal{O}({1/\sqrt{T}})$ rate: this
rate is known to be order-optimal in stochastic networks, but it is otherwise
suboptimal in static networks. In the latter case, it is possible to achieve an
$\mathcal{O}({1/T^{2}})$ equilibrium convergence rate via the use of finely
tuned accelerated algorithms; on the other hand, these accelerated algorithms
fail to converge altogether in the presence of persistent randomness, so it is
not clear how to achieve the ""best of both worlds"" in terms of convergence
speed. Our paper seeks to fill this gap by proposing an adaptive routing
algortihm with the following desirable properties: $(i)$ it seamlessly
interpolates between the $\mathcal{O}({1/T^{2}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}({1/\sqrt{T}})$ rates for static and stochastic environments
respectively; $(ii)$ its convergence speed is polylogarithmic in the number of

privilege escalation, leak sensitive information or degrade DNN model inference
accuracy. Accordingly, numerous software defenses have been proposed to protect
legacy systems while hardware defenses aim to protect next-generation
DRAM-based systems. In this paper, we systematize rowhammer attacks and
defenses with a focus on DRAM. Particularly, we characterize rowhammer attacks
comprehensively, shedding lights on possible new attack vectors that have not
yet been explored. We further summarize and classify existing software
defenses, from which new defense strategies are identified and worth future
exploring. We also categorize proposed hardware defenses from both industry and
academia and summarize their limitations. In particular, most industrial
solutions have turned out to be ineffective against rowhammer while on-die

to inspire the software-security community to identify new rowhammer attack
vectors while present novel defense solutions against them in legacy systems.
More importantly, both software and hardware security communities should work
together to develop more effective and practical defense solutions.

within biological systems from initially homogeneous states is a key issue for
biological development. The activator-inhibitor (AI) mechanism, derived from
reaction-diffusion (RD) models, has been widely believed to be the elementary
mechanism for biological pattern formation. This mechanism generally requires
activators to be self-enhanced and diffuse more slowly than inhibitors. Here,
we identify the instability sources of biological systems and derive the
self-organization conditions through solving eigenvalues (dispersion relation)
of the generalized RD model for two chemicals. We show that both the single AI
mechanisms with long-range inhibition and activation are enough to
self-organize into fully-expressed domains without the involvement of the
inhibitor-inhibitor (II) mechanism, through singly enhancing the difference in
self-proliferation rates of activators and inhibitors or weakening the coupling
degree between them. When cross diffusion involves, both the self-enhancement
and the difference in diffusion coefficients of chemicals are no longer
necessary for self-organization, and the patterning mechanism can be extended
to semi-inhibitor and II mechanisms. However, we show that the single
activator-activator (AA) mechanism is generally unable to self-organize, even
if biological domain growth is additionally involved. Moreover, adding an II
system after an AI one can produce discrete and bi-stable patterns. We also
observe that a higher dimensional space can solely alter the patterning
principles derived from a lower dimensional space, which may be due to the
instability driven by the higher degree of spatial freedom. Such results
provide new insights into biological pattern formation.

measures the ASR difference between clean state and poison state models.
Besides, since the defenses against stealthy backdoor attacks are absent, we
propose Trigger Breaker, consisting of two too simple tricks that can defend

identify a person by their voice; however, the high degree of variability in
speech signals makes this a challenging task. Dealing with emotional variations
is very difficult because emotions alter the voice characteristics of a person;
thus, the acoustic features differ from those used to train models in a neutral
environment. Therefore, speaker recognition models trained on neutral speech
fail to correctly identify speakers under emotional stress. Although
considerable advancements in speaker identification have been made using
convolutional neural networks (CNN), CNNs cannot exploit the spatial
association between low-level features. Inspired by the recent introduction of
capsule networks (CapsNets), which are based on deep learning to overcome the
inadequacy of CNNs in preserving the pose relationship between low-level
features with their pooling technique, this study investigates the performance
of using CapsNets in identifying speakers from emotional speech recordings. A
CapsNet-based speaker identification model is proposed and evaluated using
three distinct speech databases, i.e., the Emirati Speech Database, SUSAS

baseline systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel proposed
CapsNet model trains faster and provides better results over current

We conducted an experiment to determine the accuracy, speed, and confidence

that, when only informed about the total numerical value represented by the

individual regions was centered near the true value with substantial spread.
Legends with grid lines significantly reduced the spread but led to a tendency
to underestimate the values. Comparing differences between regions or between

improving accuracy. However, participants were more likely to complete the

on sensors and actuators can deceive the triggering condition of both
state-based event-triggered mechanism and combinational state-based
event-triggered mechanism, which are commonplace and widely used in the
literature. More precisely, it is first shown that a deception attack in the
case of combinational state-based event-triggered mechanism can result in a
non-triggering misbehavior, in the sense that the compromised agent does not
trigger any event and consequently results in partial feedback disconnectivity
by preventing information from reaching the local neighbors of the compromised
agent. This indicates that the combinational state-based event-triggered
mechanism can be leveraged by the attacker to harm the network connectivity by
rendering the recent data unavailable to agents. It is then shown that the
deception attack in the case of state-based event-triggered mechanism can
result in a continuous-triggering misbehavior in the sense that the
event-triggered mechanism continuously generates triggering events resulting in
undesirable phenomenon of Zeno behavior. Finally, numerical simulations are
presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.

follow the cores for five free-fall times. Individual protostars are
represented by sink particles, and the sink particles launch episodic outflows
using a subgrid model. The Optics algorithm is used to identify individual
episodic bullets within the outflows. The parameters of the overall outflow and
the individual bullets are then used to estimate the age and energetics of the
outflow, and the accretion events that triggered it; and to evaluate how
reliable these estimates are, if observational uncertainties and selection
effects (like inclination) are neglected. Of the commonly used methods for
estimating outflow ages, it appears that those based on the length and speed of

those based on the width of the outflow cavity and the speed of advance are
most reliable during the later phases. We describe a new method that is almost

to AT$\rightarrow$GC and GC$\rightarrow$AT mutation rates. By employing It\^o
calculus it is shown that if mutation rates in asexually reproducing organisms
are subject to random perturbations that can vary over time several
implications follow. For instance, an extra Brownian motion term appears
influencing nucleotide variability; the greater the variability of the random
perturbations on the mutation rates the stronger the impact of the Brownian
motion term. Reducing the influence of the random perturbations, to limit
fitness decreasing and deleterious mutations, will likely imply divesting
resources to genomic repair systems. The stable mutation rates seen in many
organisms could thus be an evolved strategy to reduce the influence of the
Brownian motion term. Furthermore, if change to genomic GC content, i.e. the GC
content of variable sites or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is just as
likely to increase as to decrease, something that resembles knockout of repair
enzymes and removal of selective pressures seen in evolutionary laboratory
experiments, the species genome will likely decay unless infinite resources are
available. These implications are solely a consequence of allowing random
perturbations affect AT- and GC mutation rates and not obtainable using

machine learning approaches, intended to predict a patient's COVID-19 status
using routinely collected and readily available clinical data. We employ
adversarial training to explore robust deep learning architectures that protect
attributes related to demographic information about the patients. The two
models we examine in this work are intended to preserve sensitive information
against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In a series of experiments
using datasets from the Oxford University Hospitals, Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, and
Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust we train and test two neural networks
that predict PCR test results using information from basic laboratory blood
tests, and vital signs performed on a patients' arrival to hospital. We assess
the level of privacy each one of the models can provide and show the efficacy
and robustness of our proposed architectures against a comparable baseline. One
of our main contributions is that we specifically target the development of
effective COVID-19 detection models with built-in mechanisms in order to
selectively protect sensitive attributes against adversarial attacks.

function in biology that has recently attracted the attention of the signal
processing and neuromorphic computing communities as a technique of event-based
sampling for data acquisition. While LIF enables the implementation of
analog-circuit signal samplers of lower complexity and higher accuracy
simultaneously, the core difficulty of this technique is the retrieval of an
input from its LIF-encoded output. In this article, we study this problem in
the context of bandlimited inputs, by extracting the most abstract features of
an LIF encoder as a generalized nonuniform sampler. In this view, the LIF
output is seen as the transformation of the input by a known linear operator.
We show that the signal reconstruction method of projection onto convex sets
(POCS) converges to a weighted pseudo-inverse of this operator. This allows
perfect recovery under uniqueness of reconstruction, minimum-norm
reconstruction under incomplete sampling, as well as a noise shaping of time
quantization that outperforms standard pseudo-inversion. On the practical side,
a single iteration of the POCS method can be used to improve any estimate whose
LIF samples are not consistent with those of the input, and a rigorous
discrete-time implementation of this iteration is proposed that does not
require a Nyquist-rate representation of the signals.

medium (ISM), they transfer vast amounts of energy and momentum that displace,
compress and heat the surrounding material. Despite the extensive work in
galaxy evolution models, it remains to be observationally validated to what
extent the molecular ISM is affected by the interaction with SNRs. We use the
first results of the ESO-ARO Public Spectroscopic Survey SHREC, to investigate
the shock interaction between the SNR IC443 and the nearby molecular clump G.
We use high sensitivity SiO(2-1) and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1-0) maps obtained by SHREC
together with SiO(1-0) observations obtained with the 40m telescope at the
Yebes Observatory. We find that the bulk of the SiO emission is arising from
the ongoing shock interaction between IC443 and clump G. The shocked gas shows
a well ordered kinematic structure, with velocities blue-shifted with respect
to the central velocity of the SNR, similar to what observed toward other
SNR-cloud interaction sites. The shock compression enhances the molecular gas
density, n(H$_2$), up to $>$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a factor of >10 higher than the
ambient gas density and similar to values required to ignite star formation.
Finally, we estimate that up to 50\% of the momentum injected by IC443 is
transferred to the interacting molecular material. Therefore the molecular ISM
may represent an important momentum carrier in sites of SNR-cloud interactions.

fluctuations increase substantially. As the consistency of the framework, we
also argue that the quantum statistical fluctuations give rise to the known
result for statistical fluctuation of energy in the canonical ensemble if we

particle quantum fluctuations show some interesting novel features. We show
that within a small sub-system quantum statistical fluctuation of energy for

quantum fluctuations obtained for different pseudo-gauge choices converge and
we recover the canonical-ensemble formula known for statistical fluctuations of

more and more network architectures have achieved outstanding success. As one
of the most advanced neural network architectures, DenseNet shortcuts all

architecture has excellent accuracy with low parameters, it requires an
excessive inference time. To solve this problem, HarDNet reduces the
connections between the feature maps, making the remaining connections resemble
harmonic waves. However, this compression method may result in a decrease in
the model accuracy and an increase in the parameters and model size. This
network architecture may reduce the memory access time, but its overall
performance can still be improved. Therefore, we propose a new network
architecture, ThreshNet, using a threshold mechanism to further optimize the

discriminative features in an image or video frame usually correspond to only a

hand. Therefore, static models which process all the pixels with an equal
amount of computation result in considerable redundancy in terms of time and
space consumption. In this paper, we formulate the image recognition problem as
a sequential coarse-to-fine feature learning process, mimicking the human
visual system. Specifically, the proposed Glance and Focus Network (GFNet)
first extracts a quick global representation of the input image at a low
resolution scale, and then strategically attends to a series of salient (small)
regions to learn finer features. The sequential process naturally facilitates
adaptive inference at test time, as it can be terminated once the model is
sufficiently confident about its prediction, avoiding further redundant
computation. It is worth noting that the problem of locating discriminant
regions in our model is formulated as a reinforcement learning task, thus
requiring no additional manual annotations other than classification labels.
GFNet is general and flexible as it is compatible with any off-the-shelf
backbone models (such as MobileNets, EfficientNets and TSM), which can be
conveniently deployed as the feature extractor. Extensive experiments on a

knowledge degradation due to the distribution shift of the synthetic data. A
straightforward approach to overcome this issue is to store and rehearse the

rungs of a three-level ladder system, in conjunction with a short pulse
excitation, can be used to provide a frequency-tunable source of on-demand
single photons. Using an intuitive master equation model, we identify two
distinct regimes of device operation: (i) for a resonant drive, the source
operates using the Autler-Townes effect, and (ii) for an off-resonant drive,
the source exploits the ac Stark effect. The former regime allows for a large
frequency tuning range but coherence suffers from timing jitter effects, while
the latter allows for high indistinguishability and efficiency, but with a
restricted tuning bandwidth due to high required drive strengths and detunings.
We show how both these negative effects can be mitigated by using an optical
cavity to increase the collection rate of the desired photons. We apply our
general theory to semiconductor quantum dots, which have proven to be excellent
single-photon sources, and find that scattering of acoustic phonons leads to
excitation-induced dephasing and increased population of the higher energy
level which limits the bandwidth of frequency tuning achievable while retaining
high indistinguishability. Despite this, for realistic cavity and quantum dot
parameters, indistinguishabilities of over $90\%$ are achievable for energy
shifts of up to hundreds of $\mu$eV, and near-unity indistinguishabilities for
energy shifts up to tens of $\mu$eV. Additionally, we clarify the

elongation, bifurcation, and cell motility such as cell-mixing during

endothelial cells are represented as the ellipses with the two-body

interaction through pseudopodia and rotation by contact. We show that the
oblateness of ellipses and the magnitude of contact rotation significantly
affect the shape of created vascular patterns and elongation of branches.

undergo global Kozai-Lidov (KL) oscillations for which the disk inclination and
eccentricity are exchanged. With hydrodynamical simulations of a gas and dust
disk we explore the effects of these oscillations on the dust density
distribution. For dust that is marginally coupled to the gas (${\rm St} \approx
1$), we find that the dust undergoes similar dynamical behaviour to the gas
disk but the radial distribution of dust may be very different to the gas. The
inward radial drift of the dust is faster in an eccentric disk leading to a
smaller outer dust disk radius. The dust breaks into multiple narrow eccentric
rings during the highly eccentric disk phase. Eccentric dust ring formation may
have significant implications for the formation of planets in misaligned disks.
We suggest that multiple dust rings may generally occur within gas disks that
have sufficiently strong eccentricity peaks at intermediate radii.

in their crystal momentum space when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is ignored. The
including of SOC drives Cu2SnS3 into a Weyl semimetal (WSM) state with only two
pairs of Weyl nodes, the minimum number required for WSM with time reversal
symmetry. In contrast, SOC leads Cu2SnSe3 to strong topological insulator (TI)
state. This difference can be well understood as there is a topological phase
transition (TPT). In it, the Weyl nodes are driven by tunable SOC and
annihilate in a mirror plane, resulting in a TI. This TPT, together with the
evolution of Weyl nodes, the changing of mirror Chern numbers of mirror plane
and the Z2 indices protected by time-reversal symmetry has been demonstrated by
the calculation of Cu2SnS3-xSex within virtual crystal approximation and an
effective k $\cdot$ p model analysis. Though our first-principles calculations
have overestimated the topological states in both compounds, we believe that
the theoretical demonstration of controlling TPT and evolution of Weyl nodes

pre-prepared models to the user. In this regard, initially, a side-lit shoebox
model with variable parameters was modeled parametrically, and five common
solar shading models with their variables were applied to the space. For each
solar shadings and the state without shading, metrics related to daylight and
glare, view, and initial costs were simulated. The database generated in this
research includes 87912 alternatives and six calculated metrics introduced to
optimized machine learning models, including neural network, random Forrest,
support vector regression, and k nearest neighbor. According to the results,
the most accurate and fastest estimation model was Random Forrest, with an
r2_score of 0.967 to 1. Then, sensitivity analysis was performed to identify
the most influential parameters for each shading model and the state without
it. This analysis distinguished the most effective parameters, including window
orientation, WWR, room width, length, and shading depth. Finally, by optimizing
the estimation function of machine learning models with the NSGA II algorithm,
about 7300 optimal models were identified. The developed tool can evaluate

whose antenna sizes are so large that the scatterers and/or users may no longer

uniform plane wave (UPW) assumption, this letter studies the near-field spatial
correlation of XL-array communications, by taking into account the more generic
non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) characteristics. It is revealed that
different from the far-field channel spatial correlation which only depends on
the power angular spectrum (PAS), the near-field spatial correlation depends on
the scattered power distribution not just characterized by their arriving
angles, but also by the scatterers' distances, which is termed as power
location spectrum (PLS). A novel integral expression is derived for the
near-field spatial correlation in terms of the scatterers' location
distribution, which includes the far-field spatial correlation as a special
case. The result shows that different from the far-field case, the near-field
spatial correlation no longer exhibits spatial stationarity in general, since
the correlation coefficient for each pair of antennas depends on their specific
positions, rather than their relative distance only. To gain further insights,
we propose a generalized one-ring model for scatterer distribution, by allowing
the ring center to be flexibly located rather than coinciding with the array
center as in the conventional one-ring model. Numerical results are provided to
show the necessity of the near-field spatial correlation modelling for XL-array

and the lack of evaluation standards and reproducibility. The current work aims
to understand two basic questions regarding the deep neural network (DNN)
method: what data the DNN needs and how general the DNN method can be. Sampling
and preprocessing determine the DNN training dataset, further affect DNN
prediction ability. The current work proposes using Box-Cox transformation
(BCT) to preprocess the combustion data. In addition, this work compares
different sampling methods with or without preprocessing, including the Monte
Carlo method, manifold sampling, generative neural network method (cycle-GAN),
and newly-proposed multi-scale sampling. Our results reveal that the DNN
trained by the manifold data can capture the chemical kinetics in limited
configurations but cannot remain robust toward perturbation, which is
inevitable for the DNN coupled with the flow field. The Monte Carlo and
cycle-GAN samplings can cover a wider phase space but fail to capture
small-scale intermediate species, producing poor prediction results. A
three-hidden-layer DNN, based on the multi-scale method without specific flame
simulation data, allows predicting chemical kinetics in various scenarios and
being stable during the temporal evolutions. This single DNN is readily
implemented with several CFD codes and validated in various combustors,
including (1). zero-dimensional autoignition, (2). one-dimensional freely
propagating flame, (3). two-dimensional jet flame with triple-flame structure,
and (4). three-dimensional turbulent lifted flames. The results demonstrate the
satisfying accuracy and generalization ability of the pre-trained DNN. The
Fortran and Python versions of DNN and example code are attached in the
supplementary for reproducibility.

tiles. This paper addresses the relationship between the length of the segment
and the number of tiles it visits (i.e. has intersection with). The square grid
is also considered explicitly, as some of the specific problems studied are
more tractable in that particular case. The segment position and orientation
can be modelled as either deterministic or random. In the deterministic
setting, the maximum possible number of visited tiles is characterized for a
given length, and conversely, the infimum segment length needed to visit a
desired number of tiles is analyzed. In the random setting, the average number
of visited tiles and the probability of visiting the maximum number of tiles on
a square grid are studied as a function of segment length. These questions are
related to Buffon's needle problem and its extension by Laplace.

powerful technique for natural language processing. The main advantage of
active learning is its potential to reduce the amount of labeled data needed to
learn high-performing models. A vital aspect of an effective active learning
algorithm is the determination of when to stop obtaining additional labeled
data. Several leading state-of-the-art stopping methods use a stop set to help
make this decision. However, there has been relatively less attention given to
the choice of stop set than to the stopping algorithms that are applied on the
stop set. Different choices of stop sets can lead to significant differences in
stopping method performance. We investigate the impact of different stop set
choices on different stopping methods. This paper shows the choice of the stop
set can have a significant impact on the performance of stopping methods and
the impact is different for stability-based methods from that on
confidence-based methods. Furthermore, the unbiased representative stop sets
suggested by original authors of methods work better than the systematically
biased stop sets used in recently published work, and stopping methods based on
stabilizing predictions have stronger performance than confidence-based
stopping methods when unbiased representative stop sets are used. We provide
the largest quantity of experimental results on the impact of stop sets to
date. The findings are important for helping to illuminate the impact of this
important aspect of stopping methods that has been under-considered in recently
published work and that can have a large practical impact on the performance of
stopping methods for important semantic computing applications such as
technology assisted review and text classification more broadly.

significant challenge for prescription, causing confusion or doubt in
physicians' decision-making process. This paper aims to develop a medicine
recommender system called RecoMed to aid the physician in the prescription
process of hypertension by providing information about what medications have
been prescribed by other doctors and figuring out what other medicines can be
recommended in addition to the one in question. Methods There are two steps to
the developed method: First, association rule mining algorithms are employed to
find medicine association rules. The second step entails graph mining and
clustering to present an enriched recommendation via ATC code, which itself
comprises several steps. First, the initial graph is constructed from
historical prescription data. Then, data pruning is performed in the second
step, after which the medicines with a high repetition rate are removed at the
discretion of a general medical practitioner. Next, the medicines are matched
to a well-known medicine classification system called the ATC code to provide
an enriched recommendation. And finally, the DBSCAN and Louvain algorithms
cluster medicines in the final step. Results A list of recommended medicines is
provided as the system's output, and physicians can choose one or more of the
medicines based on the patient's clinical symptoms. Only the medicines of class
2, related to high blood pressure medications, are used to assess the system's
performance. The results obtained from this system have been reviewed and
confirmed by an expert in this field.

the performance of beyond 5 generation (B5G) wireless communication system that
is assisted by Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) techniques. The non-linear soft margin
support vector machine (SVM) problem is used to provide an automatic modulation
classifier (AMC) and a signal power to noise and interference ratio (SINR)
estimator. The estimation results of AMC and SINR are used to reassign the
modulation type, codding rate, and transmit power through frames of eNode B
connections. The AMC success rate versus SINR, total power consuming, and sum
capacity are evaluated for OFDM-NOMA assisted 5G system. Results show
improvement of success rate compared of some published method. Furthermore, the
algorithm directly computes SINR after signal is detected by successive
interference cancellation (SIC) and before any signal decoding. Moreover,
because of the direct sense of physical channel, the presented algorithm can
discount occupied symbols (overhead signaling) for channel quality information
(CQI) in network communication signaling. The results also prove that the
proposed algorithm reduces the total power consumption and increases the sum
capacity through the eNode B connections. Simulation results in compare to
other algorithms show more successful AMC, efficient SINR estimator, easier
practical implantation, less overhead signaling, less power consumption, and
more capacity achievement.

Discovering patterns from time series is useful in many domains, such as stock
analysis, disease detection, and weather forecast. To discover patterns,
existing methods often convert time series data into another form, such as
nominal/symbolic format, to reduce dimensionality, which inevitably deviates
the data values. Moreover, existing methods mainly neglect the order
relationships between time series values. To tackle these issues, inspired by
order-preserving matching, this paper proposes an Order-Preserving sequential
Pattern (OPP) mining method, which represents patterns based on the order
relationships of the time series data. An inherent advantage of such
representation is that the trend of a time series can be represented by the
relative order of the values underneath the time series data. To obtain
frequent trends in time series, we propose the OPP-Miner algorithm to mine
patterns with the same trend (sub-sequences with the same relative order).
OPP-Miner employs the filtration and verification strategies to calculate the
support and uses pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns. To
compress the result set, we also study finding the maximal OPPs. Experiments
validate that OPP-Miner is not only efficient and scalable but can also
discover similar sub-sequences in time series. In addition, case studies show
that our algorithms have high utility in analyzing the COVID-19 epidemic by
identifying critical trends and improve the clustering performance.
