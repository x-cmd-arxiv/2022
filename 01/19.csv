to mitigate the spread of misinformation. BE-SMN is derived based on the
information transmission-time distribution by modeling the misinformation
transmission as double-spend attacks on blockchain. The misinformation
distribution is then incorporated into the SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, or
Recovered) model, which substitutes the single rate parameter in the
traditional SIR model. Then, on a multi-community network, we study the
propagation of misinformation numerically and show that the proposed blockchain
enabled social media network outperforms the baseline network in flattening the
curve of the infected population.

Traditional methods model the reward as a linear function of hand-crafted

which is impossible for real-world tasks. To get around this issue, recent deep
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) methods learn rewards directly from the
raw state but this is challenging because the robot has to implicitly learn the
features that are important and how to combine them, simultaneously. Instead,
we propose a divide and conquer approach: focus human input specifically on
learning the features separately, and only then learn how to combine them into
a reward. We introduce a novel type of human input for teaching features and an
algorithm that utilizes it to learn complex features from the raw state space.
The robot can then learn how to combine them into a reward using
demonstrations, corrections, or other reward learning frameworks. We
demonstrate our method in settings where all features have to be learned from
scratch, as well as where some of the features are known. By first focusing
human input specifically on the feature(s), our method decreases sample
complexity and improves generalization of the learned reward over a deepIRL
baseline. We show this in experiments with a physical 7DOF robot manipulator,

and complex search landscape with multiple local optima, such a SAS planning is
challenging especially in dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose
LiDOS, a lifelong dynamic optimization framework for SAS planning. What makes
LiDOS unique is that to handle the ""dynamic"", we formulate the SAS planning as
a multi-modal optimization problem, aiming to preserve the useful information
for better dealing with the local optima issue under dynamic environment
changes. This differs from existing planners in that the ""dynamic"" is not
explicitly handled during the search process in planning. As such, the search
and planning in LiDOS run continuously over the lifetime of SAS, terminating
only when it is taken offline or the search space has been covered under an
environment.
  Experimental results on three real-world SASs show that the concept of
explicitly handling dynamic as part of the search in the SAS planning is
effective, as LiDOS outperforms its stationary counterpart overall with up to
10x improvement. It also achieves better results in general over
state-of-the-art planners and with 1.4x to 10x speedup on generating promising

Generation (FEG) is a challenging task in event sequence prediction because it
requires not only fluent text generation but also commonsense reasoning to
maintain the logical coherence of the entire event story. In this paper, we

two types of event knowledge, sequential knowledge of direct event-event
relations and inferential knowledge that reflects the intermediate character
psychology between events, such as intents, causes, reactions, which
intrinsically pushes the story forward. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting
issue, we design two modules, Im and Gm, for each type of knowledge, which are
combined via prompt tuning. First, Im focuses on understanding inferential
knowledge to generate commonsense explanations and provide a soft prompt vector
for Gm. We also design a contrastive discriminator for better generalization
ability. Second, Gm generates future events by modeling direct sequential
knowledge with the guidance of Im. Automatic and human evaluation demonstrate

understood by the band theory of solid, which is based on the periodic boundary
condition (PBC) of translational invariant. For systems having PBC of
rotational invariant, in principles an analogous Bloch theorem can be developed
and applied. Taking a ring-type cluster of cyclo[18]carbon as a representative,
we theoretically suggest a quasi-band model and study its HHG by solving
time-dependent Liouville-von Neumann equation. Under the irradiation of
circularly polarized laser, explicit selection rules for left-handed and
right-handed harmonics are observed, while in linearly polarized laser field,
cyclo[18]carbon exhibits solid-like HHG originated from intra-band oscillations
and inter-band transitions, which in turn is promising to optically detect the
symmetry and geometry of controversial structures. In a sense, this work
presents a connection linking the high harmonics of gases and solids.

enhancement for sensing at criticality. However, it is unclear which of these

investigate phase transitions in free-fermionic topological systems that
exhibit neither symmetry-breaking nor long-range entanglement. We analytically
demonstrate that quantum enhanced sensing is possible using topological edge
states near the phase boundary. Remarkably, such enhancement also endures for
ground states of such models that are accessible in solid state experiments. We
illustrate the results with 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain and a 2D Chern
insulator which are both experimentally accessible. While neither
symmetry-breaking nor long-range entanglement are essential, gap closing
remains as the major candidate for the ultimate source of quantum enhanced
sensing. In addition, we also provide a fixed and simple measurement strategy
that achieves near-optimal precision for sensing using generic edge states
irrespective of the parameter value. This paves the way for development of
topological quantum sensors which are expected to also be robust against local
perturbations.

communities. Due to the linear time complexity, the $k$-core decomposition is
widely used in many real-world applications such as biology, social networks,
community detection, ecology, and information spreading. In many such
applications, the data graphs continuously change over time. The changes
correspond to edge insertion and removal. Instead of recomputing the $k$-core,
which is time-consuming, we study how to maintain the $k$-core efficiently.
That is, when inserting or deleting an edge, we need to identify the affected
vertices by searching for more vertices. The state-of-the-art order-based
method maintains an order, the so-called $k$-order, among all vertices, which
can significantly reduce the searching space. However, this order-based method
is complicated for understanding and implementation, and its correctness is not
formally discussed. In this work, we propose a simplified order-based approach
by introducing the classical Order Data Structure to maintain the $k$-order,
which significantly improves the worst-case time complexity for both edge
insertion and removal algorithms. Also, our simplified method is intuitive to
understand and implement; it is easy to argue the correctness formally.
Additionally, we discuss a simplified batch insertion approach. The experiments
evaluate our simplified method over 12 real and synthetic graphs with billions
of vertices. Compared with the existing method, our simplified approach
achieves high speedups up to 7.7x and 9.7x for edge insertion and removal,

describe an electrostatic theory of ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices,
convenient model systems, and show the relationship between the negative

standard for various diagnosis and treatment tasks. Most segmentation methods,
however, simply model a mapping from an image to its single segmentation map

account for inter-observer variability, without sacrificing accuracy, we
propose a novel variational inference framework to model the distribution of
plausible segmentation maps, given a specific MR image, which explicitly
represents the multi-reader variability. Specifically, we resort to a latent
vector to encode the multi-reader variability and counteract the inherent
information loss in the imaging data. Then, we apply a variational autoencoder

the distribution of the segmentation map, given an MR image. Experimental
results, carried out with the QUBIQ brain growth MRI segmentation datasets with

garnered significant research interest. A linear frequency offset (FO) across
FDA antennas yields a range-angle dependent beampattern that allows for joint
estimation of range and direction-of-arrival (DoA). Prior works on FDA largely
focus on the one-dimensional linear array to estimate only azimuth angle and
range while ignoring the elevation and Doppler velocity. However, in many
applications, the latter two parameters are also essential for target
localization. Further, there is also an interest in radar systems that employ
fewer measurements in temporal, Doppler, or spatial signal domains. We address
these multiple challenges by proposing a co-prime L-shaped FDA, wherein
co-prime FOs are applied across the elements of L-shaped co-prime array and
each element transmits at a non-uniform co-prime pulse repetition interval
(C$^3$ or C-Cube). This co-pulsing FDA yields significantly large
degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) for target localization in the
range-azimuth-elevation-Doppler domain while also reducing the time-on-target
and transmit spectral usage. By exploiting these DoFs, we develop C-Cube
auto-pairing (CCing) algorithm, in which all the parameters are ipso facto
paired during a joint estimation. We show that C-Cube FDA requires at least
$2\sqrt{Q+1}-1$ antenna elements and $2\sqrt{Q+1}-1$ pulses to guarantee
perfect recovery of $Q$ targets as against $Q+1$ elements and $Q+1$ pulses
required by both L-shaped uniform linear array and L-shaped linear FO FDA with
uniform pulsing. We derive Cram\'er-Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint

reconfigurable control scheme is presented, which comprises a \emph{Nonlinear

collective estimation as an example of collective decision-making. The task is
to estimate the average scalar intensity of a desired feature in the

phases, where the switching time is a factor dictating the balance between the
two phases. By decomposing the total accuracy into bias and variance, we
explain that diversity and social interactions could promote the accuracy of
the collective decision. We also show how the exploration-vs-exploitation
tradeoff relates to the speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff. One significant finding of
our work is that there is an optimal duration for exploration to compromise
between speed and accuracy. This duration cannot be determined offline for an
unknown environment. Hence, we propose an adaptive, distributed mechanism
enabling individual agents to decide in a decentralized manner when to switch.
Moreover, the spatial consequence of the exploitation phase is an emergent
collective movement, leading to the aggregation of the collective at the
iso-contours of the mean intensity of the environmental field in the spatial
domain. Examples of potential applications for such a fully distributed
collective estimation model are spillage capturing and source localization.

i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen
through the lens of the GNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed
to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more
generally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem.
The most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph
representation for molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a
bond between each pair of atoms within a chosen cutoff. Bonds can be decorated
with the distance between atoms, and the resulting ""distance graph NNs"" (dGNN)
have empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in
chemical ML, with all known indistinguishable configurations being resolved in
the fully-connected limit, which is equivalent to infinite or sufficiently
large cutoff. Here we present a counterexample that proves that dGNNs are not
complete even for the restricted case of fully-connected graphs induced by 3D
atom clouds. We construct pairs of distinct point clouds whose associated

chemically-plausible configurations, both for isolated structures and for
infinite structures that are periodic in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. The existence
of indistinguishable configurations sets an ultimate limit to the expressive

combinatorial bandit algorithms for the bid optimization of advertising
campaigns subject to uncertain budget and ROI constraints. We study the nature

the optimization problem without uncertainty, we show that it is inapproximable
within any factor unless P=NP, and we provide a pseudo-polynomial-time
algorithm that achieves an optimal solution. When considering uncertainty, we
prove that no online learning algorithm can violate the (ROI or budget)
constraints during the learning process a sublinear number of times while
guaranteeing a sublinear pseudo-regret. Thus, we provide an algorithm, namely
GCB, guaranteeing sublinear regret at the cost of a potentially linear number
of constraints violations. We also design its safe version, namely GCB_{safe},
guaranteeing w.h.p. a constant upper bound on the number of constraints
violations at the cost of a linear pseudo-regret. More interestingly, we
provide an algorithm, namely GCB_{safe}(\psi,\phi), guaranteeing both sublinear
pseudo-regret and safety w.h.p. at the cost of accepting tolerances \psi and
\phi in the satisfaction of the ROI and budget constraints, respectively. This
algorithm actually mitigates the risks due to the constraints violations
without precluding the convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we
experimentally compare our algorithms in terms of
pseudo-regret/constraint-violation tradeoff in settings generated from

the mean path length of ballistic trajectories randomly crossing a convex 2D
domain, to the ratio between the region area and its perimeter. This theorem
has been generalized for non-convex domains and extended to the case of
Brownian motion to find many applications in various fields including
biological locomotion and wave physics. Here, we generalize the theorem to
arbitrary closed trajectories exploring arbitrary domains. We demonstrate that,
regardless of the complexity of the trajectory, the mean arc length still
satisfies Cauchy's formula provided that no trajectory is entirely contained in
the domain. Below this threshold, the mean arc length decreases with the size
of the trajectory. In this case, an approximate analytical formula can still be
given for convex trajectories intersecting convex domains provided they are
small in comparison. To validate our analysis, we performed numerical
simulations of different types of trajectories exploring arbitrary 2D domains.
Our results could be applied to retrieve geometric information of bounded
domains from the mean first entrance-exit length.

in European Union (EU) countries addressing spatial and temporal behaviour. In
particular, the models can quantitatively describe the interaction between
countries or explain the rapidly growing trends in AI patents. For spatial
analysis Poisson regression is used to explain collaboration between a pair of
countries measured by the number of common patents. Through Bayesian inference,
we estimated the strengths of interactions between countries in the EU and the
rest of the world. In particular, a significant lack of cooperation has been
identified for some pairs of countries.
  Alternatively, an inhomogeneous Poisson process combined with the logistic
curve growth accurately models the temporal behaviour by an accurate trend
line. Bayesian analysis in the time domain revealed an upcoming slowdown in
patenting intensity.

These models are known to host new phases of matter and act as a bridge between
particle and condensed matter physics. In this article, we study the Abelian
$U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $(3+1)$-d tubes using large-scale exact
diagonalization (ED). We are then able to motivate the phase diagram of the

involving fermionic quantum links, which generalize the gauge degrees of
freedom to be of fermionic nature. We prove that while the spectra remain
identical between the bosonic and the fermionic versions of the
$U(1)$-symmetric quantum link models in $(2+1)$-d, they are different in
$(3+1)$-d. We discuss the prospects of realizing the magnetic field
interactions as correlated hopping in quantum simulator experiments.

of a similar analysis of the PAH emission in NGC 2023. The biplots and the

flux, we propose a novel closure by prescribing the specific heat capacity of
the gas flow. Setting the specific heat capacity to that of a constant-pressure

momentum transport equation contains the mean field forcing, which is an
averaged effect of the intermolecular potential. Remarkably, the balanced flow
equations do not contain any information about internal thermodynamic
properties of the gas, and are thereby applicable to a broad range of different
gases. We conduct numerical simulations for an air-like gas at normal
conditions in the inertial flow regime, where the pressure is constant

that socioeconomic status (SES) modulates these effects. Amenities within about
a 1km radius are strongly associated with a higher propensity to walk and lower
driving time only for only the wealthiest group. In contrast, a higher density
of amenities is associated with shorter bus trips for low and middle SES

stumbles on a roadblock when key decisions about modifying the software
codebase need to be made. This is attested by the fact that both of the two
major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have undergone hard forks that
resulted in the creation of alternative systems, creating confusion and
opportunities for fraudulent activities. These events, and numerous others,
underscore the importance of Blockchain governance, namely the set of processes
that blockchain platforms utilize in order to perform decision-making and
converge to a widely accepted direction for the system to evolve. While a rich
topic of study in other areas, governance of blockchain platforms is lacking a
well established set of methods and practices that are adopted industry wide.
This makes the topic of blockchain governance a fertile domain for a thorough
systematization that we undertake in this work.
  We start by distilling a comprehensive array of properties for sound
governance systems drawn from academic sources as well as grey literature of
election systems and blockchain white papers. These are divided into seven
categories, confidentiality, verifiability, accountability, sustainability,
Pareto efficiency, suffrage and liveness that capture the whole spectrum of
desiderata of governance systems. We proceed to classify ten well-documented
blockchain systems. While all properties are satisfied, even partially, by at
least one system, no system that satisfies most of them. Our work lays out a
foundation for assessing blockchain governance processes. While it highlights
shortcomings and deficiencies in currently deployed systems, it can also be a
catalyst for improving these processes to the highest possible standard with
appropriate trade-offs, something direly needed for blockchain platforms to
operate effectively in the long term.

a challenging stochastic forecasting problem. In this work, we propose MUSE, a
new probabilistic modeling framework based on a cascade of Conditional VAEs,
which tackles the long-term, uncertain trajectory prediction task using a
coarse-to-fine multi-factor forecasting architecture. In its Macro stage, the
model learns a joint pixel-space representation of two key factors, the
underlying environment and the agent movements, to predict the long and
short-term motion goals. Conditioned on them, the Micro stage learns a
fine-grained spatio-temporal representation for the prediction of individual
agent trajectories. The VAE backbones across the two stages make it possible to
naturally account for the joint uncertainty at both levels of granularity. As a
result, MUSE offers diverse and simultaneously more accurate predictions
compared to the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate these assertions
through a comprehensive set of experiments on nuScenes and SDD benchmarks as
well as PFSD, a new synthetic dataset, which challenges the forecasting ability

extension to an exterior domain faces a fundamental difficulty that the
corresponding linear semigroup may not be contractive in analytic spaces as was
the case on the half-space [19]. In this paper, we resolve this open problem
for a much larger class of initial data. The resolution is due to the fact that
it suffices to propagate solutions that are analytic only near the boundary,

a good strategy. It consists in learning a model on a small amount of annotated
data (annotation budget) and in choosing the best set of points to annotate in
order to improve the previous model and gain in generalization. In deep
learning, active learning is usually implemented as an iterative process in
which successive deep models are updated via fine tuning, but it still poses
some issues. First, the initial batch of annotated images has to be
sufficiently large to train a deep model. Such an assumption is strong,
especially when the total annotation budget is reduced. We tackle this issue by
using an approach inspired by transfer learning. A pre-trained model is used as
a feature extractor and only shallow classifiers are learned during the active
iterations. The second issue is the effectiveness of probability or feature
estimates of early models for AL task. Samples are generally selected for
annotation using acquisition functions based only on the last learned model. We
introduce a novel acquisition function which exploits the iterative nature of
AL process to select samples in a more robust fashion. Samples for which there
is a maximum shift towards uncertainty between the last two learned models
predictions are favored. A diversification step is added to select samples from
different regions of the classification space and thus introduces a
representativeness component in our approach. Evaluation is done against
competitive methods with three balanced and imbalanced datasets and outperforms
them.

algorithmic confounding in collaborative filtering-based recommendation

collaborative filtering-based model, trained on simulated choices, is used by
the recommendation algorithm to recommend items to agents. Agents might choose
some of these items, according to an underlying teacher model, with new choices
then fed back into the student model as new training data (approximating online

produces erroneous recommendations which in turn lead to instability, i.e.,
wide variations in an item's popularity between each simulation realization. We
use the simulations to demonstrate a novel approach to training collaborative

methodology is general enough that it can be extended to other socio-technical

local optimality of the empirical training objective is insufficient. Yet, it
does not rule out the possibility that achieving a true population minimax
optimal solution might imply distribution learning.
  In this paper, we show that standard cryptographic assumptions imply that
this stronger condition is still insufficient. Namely, we show that if local
pseudorandom generators (PRGs) exist, then for a large family of natural
continuous target distributions, there are ReLU network generators of constant
depth and polynomial size which take Gaussian random seeds so that (i) the
output is far in Wasserstein distance from the target distribution, but (ii) no
polynomially large Lipschitz discriminator ReLU network can detect this. This
implies that even achieving a population minimax optimal solution to the

implementation flexibility compared with traditional methods. However, their
computational cost has hindered their wider adoption. By exploiting the power
of deep learning, we developed a new speckle-based phase-contrast imaging
neural network (SPINNet) that boosts the phase retrieval speed by at least two
orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. To achieve this performance,
we combined SPINNet with a novel coded-mask-based technique, an enhanced
version of the speckle-based method. Using this scheme, we demonstrate a
simultaneous reconstruction of absorption and phase images on the order of 100
ms, where a traditional correlation-based analysis would take several minutes
even with a cluster. In addition to significant improvement in speed, our
experimental results show that the imaging resolution and phase retrieval
quality of SPINNet outperform existing single-shot speckle-based methods.
Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate its application in 3D X-ray
phase-contrast tomography. Our result shows that SPINNet could enable many
applications requiring high-resolution and fast data acquisition and
processing, such as in-situ and in-operando 2D and 3D phase-contrast imaging

disks is the ability for accreting gas to develop an aligned angular momentum
distribution via internal cancellation *prior* to joining the galaxy. Among
galaxies with a high fraction (>70%) of their young stars in a thin disk
(h/R~0.1) we find that: (i) hot, virial-temperature gas dominates the inflowing
gas mass on halo scales (>~20 kpc), with radiative losses offset by compression
heating; (ii) this hot accretion proceeds until angular momentum support slows
inward motion, at which point the gas cools to T~10^4 K or less; (iii) prior to
cooling, the accreting gas develops an angular momentum distribution that is
aligned with the galaxy disk, and while cooling transitions from a
quasi-spherical spatial configuration to a more flattened, disk-like
configuration. We show that the existence of this ""rotating cooling flow""
accretion mode is strongly correlated with the fraction of stars forming in a
thin disk among a sample of 17 z~0 galaxies spanning a halo mass range of
10^10.5 solar masses to 10^12 solar masses, or a stellar mass range 10^8 solar
masses to 10^11 solar masses. Notably, galaxies with a thick disk or irregular
morphology do not undergo significant angular momentum alignment of gas prior
to accretion and show no correspondence between halo gas cooling and
flattening. Our results suggest that rotating cooling flows (or, more
generally, rotating subsonic flows) that become coherent and angular
momentum-supported prior to accretion onto the galaxy are likely a necessary
condition for the formation of thin, star-forming disk galaxies in a LambdaCDM

be used to define a set of local projection operators. An auxiliary Hamiltonian

bounded by the ground-state degeneracy of the auxiliary Hamiltonian on this

model-independent method to restrict momentum-space observables to the

act linearly on terms in the conventional position-space operator product
expansion (OPE). Artifacts from the truncation of the integral can be
systematically pushed to higher powers in $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/k_T$. We
demonstrate that this method can be used to compute the cumulative integral of
TMD PDFs over $k_T \le k_T^\mathrm{cut}$ in terms of collinear PDFs, accounting
for both radiative corrections and evolution effects. This yields a systematic
way of correcting the naive picture where the TMD PDF integrates to a collinear
PDF, and for unpolarized quark distributions we find that when renormalization
scales are chosen near $k_T^\mathrm{cut}$, such corrections are a percent-level
effect. We also show that, when supplemented with experimental data and
improved perturbative inputs, our integral functionals will enable
model-independent limits to be put on the nonperturbative OPE contributions to

group, which leads to a new gapped phase with emergent gauge structure and can
be described algebraically using the mathematical framework of modular tensor
category (MTC). We develop a categorical description of U(1) gauging in an MTC,
taking into account the dynamics of U(1) gauge field absent in the finite group
case. When the ungauged system has a non-zero Hall conductance, the gauged
theory remains gapped and we determine the complete set of anyon data for the
gauged theory. On the other hand, when the Hall conductance vanishes, we argue
that gauging has the same effect of condensing a special Abelian anyon
nucleated by inserting $2\pi$ U(1) flux. We apply our procedure to the
SU(2)$_k$ MTCs and derive the full MTC data for the $\mathbb{Z}_k$ parafermion
MTCs. We also discuss a dual U(1) symmetry that emerges after the original U(1)
symmetry of an MTC is gauged.

the major breakthroughs in modern cosmology. Several cosmological probes (CMB,
SNe Ia, BAO) have been studied in depth to better understand the nature of the
mechanism driving this acceleration, and they are being currently pushed to
their limits, obtaining remarkable constraints that allowed us to shape the
standard cosmological model. In parallel to that, however, the percent
precision achieved has recently revealed apparent tensions between measurements
obtained from different methods. These are either indicating some unaccounted
systematic effects, or are pointing toward new physics. Following the
development of CMB, SNe, and BAO cosmology, it is critical to extend our
selection of cosmological probes. Novel probes can be exploited to validate
results, control or mitigate systematic effects, and, most importantly, to
increase the accuracy and robustness of our results. This review is meant to
provide a state-of-art benchmark of the latest advances in emerging
beyond-standard cosmological probes. We present how several different methods
can become a key resource for observational cosmology. In particular, we review
cosmic chronometers, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, standard sirens, lensing
time-delay with galaxies and clusters, cosmic voids, neutral hydrogen intensity
mapping, surface brightness fluctuations, stellar ages of the oldest objects,
secular redshift drift, and clustering of standard candles. The review
describes the method, systematics, and results of each probe in a homogeneous
way, giving the reader a clear picture of the available innovative methods that
have been introduced in recent years and how to apply them. The review also
discusses the potential synergies and complementarities between the various
probes, exploring how they will contribute to the future of modern cosmology.

This study is based on 110 observations obtained over 20 years with the Chandra

The data are complete to a sensitivity of about 10^{39} erg/s, with a typical

catalogue contains about 80 ULXs (0.3-10 keV luminosity >10^{39} erg/s), and
provides their location, observed flux, de-absorbed luminosity, and (for the 25
most luminous ones) simple X-ray spectral properties. We discuss the ULX
luminosity function in relation to the mass and star formation rate of the
sample galaxies. We show that recent models of low-mass plus high-mass X-ray
binary populations (scaling with stellar mass and star formation rate,
respectively) are mostly consistent with our observational results. We
tentatively identify the most luminous X-ray source in the sample (a source in

remnant. The properties of the sample galaxies (morphologies, stellar masses,

compared to the commonly used non-rotating, single-star scenario. The largest
differences are noticeable at low metallicity, where the mechanical-energy

obtained by neglecting dissipation in the near circumstellar environment)

feedback estimates to simulate the formation and evolution of a sub-$L_*$

supernova (SN) feedback is considered. Accounting for the continuous energy
injection by winds reduces the total stellar mass, the metal content, and the
burstiness of the star-formation rate as well as of the outflowing gas mass.
However, our numerical experiment suggests that the enhanced mechanical
feedback from the winds of rotating and binary stars has a limited impact on
the most relevant galactic properties compared to the non-rotating single-star

entrained in winds and those ejected by SNe and find that it stays nearly

Model (SM) could be unified at high energies in an $SU(4)\times Sp(6)_L \times
Sp(6)_R$ anomaly-free gauge model. All the SM fermions are packaged into two
fundamental fields, $\Psi_L \sim (\mathbf{4}, \mathbf{6}, \mathbf{1})$ and
$\Psi_R\sim (\mathbf{4}, \mathbf{1},\mathbf{6})$, thereby explaining the origin
of three families of fermions. The SM Higgs, being electroweakly charged,
necessarily becomes charged also under flavour when embedded in the UV model.
It is therefore natural for its vacuum expectation value to couple only to the
third family. The other components of the UV Higgs fields are presumed heavy.
Extra scalars are needed to break this symmetry down to the SM, which can
proceed via `flavour-deconstructed' gauge groups; for instance, we propose a
pattern $Sp(6)_L \to \prod_{i=1}^3 SU(2)_{L,i} \to SU(2)_L$ for the left-handed
factor. When the heavy Higgs components are integrated out, realistic quark
Yukawa couplings with in-built hierarchies are naturally generated without any
further ingredients, if we assume the various symmetry breaking scalars
condense at different scales. The CKM matrix that we compute is not a generic
unitary matrix, but it can precisely fit the observed values.

We develop a method, similar to Gaussian process regression, which we term
local pixelwise infilling (LPI). Using a local covariance estimate, we predict
the background behind each star and the uncertainty on that prediction in order
to improve estimates of flux and flux uncertainty. We show the validity of our
model on synthetic data and real dust fields. We further demonstrate that the

DM is a Majorana fermion which interacts with right-handed electrons via a
scalar mediator. Assuming that the photons measured from the core of Cen A are
coming from SM processes, we derive constraints on the average annihilation
cross section which are 7 orders of magnitude stronger than the ones from
measurements of the Galactic Center. Focusing on the allowed parameter space
range, we calculate the flux of photons coming from the radiative DM-electron
scattering in the AGN jets and the circular polarisation asymmetry of these
photons. We find that this flux is two orders of magnitude lower than the
background but its circular polarisation asymmetry can reach values close to
$100\%$, indicating the need to experimentally exploit the high fraction of
circular polarisation in order to detect these interactions. Since the origin
of the photons in the GeV-TeV range from Cen A is not completely clear and an
exotic origin is compatible with the measurements as well, we also consider the
scenario in which synchrotron radiation can only partially explain the photon

the mismatch. However we should mention that this extra CFT structure can't be
constructed out of conserved currents and hence counting mismatch between CFT

realistic, though still extreme, models of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).
While inferring the detailed properties of the first galaxies is one of the
most important motivations for measuring the high-$z$ 21-cm signal, they can
also provide useful constraints on the properties of the intergalactic medium
(IGM). Motivated by this, we build a simple, phenomenological model for the
21-cm power spectrum that works directly in terms of IGM properties, which
bypasses the computationally expensive 3-D semi-numerical modeling generally
employed in inference pipelines and avoids explicit assumptions about galaxy
properties. The key simplifying assumptions are that (i) the ionization field
is binary, and composed of spherical bubbles with an abundance described well
by a parametric bubble size distribution, and (ii) that the spin temperature of
the ``bulk'' IGM outside bubbles is uniform. Despite the simplicity of the
model, the mean ionized fraction and spin temperature of the IGM recovered from
mock 21-cm power spectra generated with \textsc{21cmfast} are generally in good
agreement with the true input values. This suggests that it is possible to
obtain comparable constraints on the IGM using models with very different
assumptions, parameters, and priors. Our approach will thus be complementary to
semi-numerical models as upper limits continue to improve in the coming years.

main result is that 7-10 (depending on strictness of criteria) of the galaxies
host one or more X-ray AGNs, even though none of them were classified as AGNs
based on their single-fiber optical spectra. We find that these AGNs were not
identified in the single-fiber spectra because they are AGNs in the nuclei of

undergo first-forbidden non-unique beta decays which inhibits a prediction of
their spectral shape using symmetries alone and this has, so far, obstructed a
definitive prediction of their neutrino capture cross sections. In this work we
point out that for both elements the so-called ""$\xi$-approximation"" is
applicable and this effectively reduces the spectral shape to deviate by at
most $1\%$ from the one that would arise if beta decays were of the allowed
type. Using measured half-lives we extract the relevant nuclear matrix element
and predict the neutrino capture cross sections for both isotopes at $1\%$
level, accounting for a number of relevant effects including radiative
corrections and the finite size of the nuclei. We obtained $(1.12\pm
0.01)\times 10^{-46}{\rm cm}^2$ for $^{171}$Tm and $(4.77\pm 0.01)\times
10^{-48}{\rm cm}^2$ for $^{151}$Sm. This method is robust as it does not rely
on the data points near the end-point of the beta spectrum which may be
contaminated by atomic physics effects, namely shake-up and shake-off. Finally,
we calculate the target mass which is necessary for cosmic neutrino discovery
and discuss several bottlenecks and respective solutions associated to the
experimental program. We conclude that the detection of cosmic neutrino
background by neutrino capture on $^{151}$Sm and $^{171}$Tm is achievable and
free from theoretical limitations but still subject to technical issues that
should be further investigated by the experimentalists in the context of the
proposed PTOLEMY project.

magnetic field with a spiral-shaped distribution of intensity. As the second
collapse occurs, this field is dragged inward and grows in strength, with the
maximum field strength increasing with resolution. As the second core forms,
the maximum field strength exceeds 1~kG in our highest resolution simulations,
and the stellar core field strength exceeds this threshold at the highest
resolution. Our resolution study suggests that kG-strength magnetic fields may
be implanted in low-mass stars during their formation, and may persist over
long timescales given that the diffusion timescale for the magnetic field
exceeds the age of the Universe.

realize a translation-invariant, free-fermion-solvable spin model. In this

generators of the code and whose exact spectrum and eigenstates can be found
via a generalized Jordan-Wigner transformation. Such solutions are
characterized by the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian: the graph whose
vertices are Hamiltonian terms, which are neighboring if the terms anticommute.
We provide methods for embedding a given frustration graph in the
anticommutation relations of a spin model and present the first known example
of an exactly solvable spin model with a two-dimensional free-fermion
description and exact topological qubits. This model can be viewed as a
free-fermionized version of the two-dimensional Bacon-Shor code. Using
graph-theoretic tools to study the unit cell, we give an efficient algorithm
for deciding if a given translation-invariant spin model is solvable, and
explicitly construct the solution. Further, we examine the energetics of these
exactly solvable models from the graph-theoretic perspective and show that the
relevant gaps of the spin model correspond to known graph-theoretic quantities:
the skew energy and the median eigenvalue of an oriented graph. Finally, we
numerically search for models which have large spectral gaps above the ground
state spin configuration and thus exhibit particularly robust thermal
suppression of errors. These results suggest that optimal models will have low
dimensionality and odd coordination numbers, and that the primary limit to
energetic error suppression is the skew energy difference between different
symmetry sectors rather than single-particle excitations of the free fermions.

that, under reasonable assumptions, colour selection is relatively ineffective
at separating homogeneous morphologies. Even with the use of up to six colours

the whole SED, the gains are not significant, with purity values remaining

poses fundamental limits on the computational tractability and performance of a

require the system to be functionally observable, meaning that a targeted

Here, we develop a graph-based theory of functional observability, which leads
to highly scalable algorithms to i) determine the minimal set of required
sensors and ii) design the corresponding state observer of minimum order.
Compared to the full-state observer, the proposed functional observer achieves
the same estimation quality with substantially less sensing and computational

methods to the detection of cyber-attacks in power grids from limited phase
measurement data and the inference of the prevalence rate of infection during
an epidemic under limited testing conditions. The applications demonstrate that
the functional observer can significantly scale up our ability to explore

circumgalactic medium (CGM) at high redshifts. In this work, we aim to explore
the existence of Ly${\alpha}$ haloes around individual UV-selected galaxies,
rather than around Ly${\alpha}$ emitters (LAEs), at high redshifts. Our sample
was continuum-selected with F775W<=27.5, and spectroscopic redshifts were
assigned or constrained for all the sources thanks to the deepest (100- to
140-hour) existing Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer
(MUSE) data with adaptive optics. The final sample includes 21 galaxies that
are purely F775W-magnitude selected within the redshift range z=2.9-4.4 and
within a UV magnitude range -20<=M1500<= -18, thus avoiding any bias toward
LAEs. We tested whether galaxy's Ly${\alpha}$ emission is significantly more
extended than the MUSE PSF-convolved continuum component. We find 17 LAHs and
four non-LAHs. We report the first individual detections of extended
Ly${\alpha}$ emission around non-LAEs. The Ly${\alpha}$ halo fraction is thus
as high as $81.0^{+10.3}_{-11.2}$%, which is close to that for LAEs at z=3-6 in
the literature. This implies that UV-selected galaxies generally have a large
amount of hydrogen in their CGM. We derived the mean surface brightness (SB)
profile for our LAHs with cosmic dimming corrections and find that Ly${\alpha}$
emission extends to 5.4 arcsec (~40 physical kpc at the midpoint redshift
z=3.6) above the typical 1${\sigma}$ SB limit. The incidence rate of
surrounding gas detected in Ly${\alpha}$ per one-dimensional line of sight per
unit redshift, dn/dz, is estimated to be $0.76^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$ for galaxies
with M1500<= -18 mag at z~3.7. Assuming that Ly${\alpha}$ emission and
absorption arise in the same gas, this suggests, based on abundance matching,
that LAHs trace the same gas as damped Ly${\alpha}$ systems (DLAs) and
sub-DLAs.

edge modes protected by the bulk gap. In contrast, recent work (Phys. Rev. B
104, 075132) proposed intrinsically gapless topological phases that, in one
dimension, carry protected edge modes only when the bulk is a gapless Luttinger
liquid. The edge modes of such a topological Luttinger liquid (TLL) descend
from a nonlocal string order that is forbidden in gapped phases and whose
precise form depends on the symmetry class of the system. In this work, we
propose a powerful and unbiased entanglement-based smoking gun signature of the
TLL. In particular, we show that the entanglement entropy profile of a TLL
lacks Friedel oscillations that are invariably present in other gapless one
dimensional phases such as ordinary Luttinger liquids, and argue that their
absence is closely related to a long-ranged string order which is an intrinsic
property of the TLL. Crucially, such a diagnostic is more robust against
numerical errors and relatively easier to measure in experiments as it relies
on the entanglement entropy rather than entanglement spectrum, unlike the
entanglement-based diagnostics of gapped topological phases in one dimension.

$x_\mathrm{HI}$, from the observed number density ratio of LAEs to LBGs,
$n(\mathrm{LAE})/n(\mathrm{LBG})$ based on numerical radiative transfer
simulation, in which model galaxies are selected to satisfy the observed
selection function. While the average $x_\mathrm{HI}$ within the field of view
is found to be $x_\mathrm{HI} < 0.4$, which is consistent with previous
studies, the variation of $n(\mathrm{LAE})/n(\mathrm{LBG})$ within the field of
view for each $140\,\mathrm{pMpc}^2$ is found to be as large as a factor of
three. This may suggest a spatially inhomogeneous topology of reionization, but
it also leaves open the possibility that the variation is based on the inherent
large-scale structure of the galaxy distribution. Based on the simulations, it
may be difficult to distinguish between the two from the current survey. We
also find that LAEs in the high LAE density region are more populate high
$\mathrm{EW}_0$, supporting that the observed $n(\mathrm{LAE})/n(\mathrm{LBG})$
is more or less driven by the neutral fraction, though the statistical

of $\rm M_{HI} = (2.74 \pm 0.33) \times 10^9 \ M_\odot$ and a high
HI-to-stellar mass ratio, $\approx 1.3$. The FRB host is thus a gas-rich but
near-quiescent galaxy, that is likely to have acquired a significant mass of HI
in the recent past. The HI distribution is disturbed, with extended HI 21cm
emission detected in a north-eastern tail, a counter-tail towards the south, an
HI hole between the galaxy centre and the FRB location, and a high HI column
density measured close to the FRB position. The FRB host is part of a group
with four companions detected in their HI 21cm emission, the nearest of which
is only 22~kpc from the FRB location. The gas-richness and disturbed HI
distribution indicate that the FRB host has recently undergone a minor merger,
which increased its HI mass, disturbed the HI in the galaxy disk, and
compressed the HI near the FRB location to increase its surface density. We
propose that this merger caused the burst of star-formation in the outskirts of
the galaxy that gave rise to the FRB progenitor. The evidence for a minor
merger is consistent with scenarios in which the FRB progenitor is a massive
star, formed due to the merger event.

compilers for imperative programming languages. However, functional languages
have been slow to adopt SSA and prefer to use intermediate representations
based on minimal lambda calculi due to SSA's inability to express higher order
constructs. We exploit a new SSA construct -- regions -- in order to express
functional optimizations via classical SSA based reasoning. Region optimization
currently relies on ad-hoc analyses and transformations on imperative programs.
These ad-hoc transformations are sufficient for imperative languages as regions
are used in a limited fashion. In contrast, we use regions pervasively to model
sub-expressions in our functional IR. This motivates us to systematize region
optimizations. We extend classical SSA reasoning to regions for
functional-style analyses and transformations. We implement a new SSA+regions
based backend for LEAN4, a theorem prover that implements a purely functional,
dependently typed programming language. Our backend is feature-complete and
handles all constructs of LEAN4's functional intermediate representation
{\lambda}rc within the SSA framework. We evaluate our proposed region
optimizations by optimizing {\lambda}rc within an SSA+regions based framework
implemented in MLIR and demonstrating performance parity with the current LEAN4
backend. We believe our work will pave the way for a unified optimization
framework capable of representing, analyzing, and optimizing both functional

are and whether the fits end up in the regime of superfluid dark matter where
the model resembles modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We fitted the
superfluid dark matter model to the rotation curves of 169 galaxies in the
SPARC sample. We found that the mass-to-light ratios obtained with superfluid
dark matter are generally acceptable in terms of stellar populations. However,
the best-fit mass-to-light ratios have an unnatural dependence on the size of
the galaxy in that giant galaxies have systematically lower mass-to-light
ratios than dwarf galaxies. A second finding is that the superfluid often fits
the rotation curves best in the regime where the superfluid's force cannot
resemble that of MOND without adjusting a boundary condition separately for
each galaxy. In that case, we can no longer expect superfluid dark matter to
reproduce the phenomenologically observed scaling relations that make MOND
appealing. If, on the other hand, we consider only solutions whose force
approximates MOND well, then the total mass of the superfluid is in tension
with gravitational lensing data. We conclude that even the best fits with
superfluid dark matter are still unsatisfactory for two reasons. First, the
resulting stellar mass-to-light ratios show an unnatural trend with galaxy
size. Second, the fits do not end up in the regime that automatically resembles
MOND, and if we force the fits to do so, the total dark matter mass is in
tension with strong lensing data.

utilizes an efficient bouncy particle sampler (BPS) to tackle the computational
bottleneck -- integrating many latent variables from a high-dimensional

specimens grows and fails to reliably characterize conditional dependencies
between traits. Here, we propose an inference pipeline for phylogenetic probit
models that greatly outperforms BPS. The novelty lies in 1) a combination of
the recent Zigzag Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (Zigzag-HMC) with linear-time
gradient evaluations and 2) a joint sampling scheme for highly correlated

patterns in our observational data set and compare the results with mock
galaxies consisting of pure random motions, and simulated dwarfs formed via the
dissolving star cluster and tidal stirring models. Methods: We made use of a
new spectroscopic data set for the Milky Way dSph Leo I, combining 288 stars
observed with Magellan/IMACS and existing Keck/DEIMOS data, to provide velocity
and metallicity measurements for 953 Leo I member stars. We used a specially
developed algorithm called Beacon to detect chemo-kinematical patterns in the

the detection of 14 candidate streams of stars that may have originated in
disrupted star clusters. The angular momentum vectors of these streams are
randomly oriented, consistent with the lack of rotation in Leo I. These results
are consistent with the predictions of the dissolving cluster model. In
contrast, we find fewer candidate stream signals in mock data sets that lack
coherent motions ~99% of the time. The chemodynamical analysis of the tidal
stirring simulation produces streams that share a common orientation of their
angular momenta, which is inconsistent with the Leo I data. Conclusions: Even
though it is very difficult to distinguish which of the detected streams are
real and which are only noise, we can be certain that there are more streams
detected in the observational data of Leo I than expected in pure random data.

to estimate the pose of each new object, often requiring tens of GPU-days of

framework, leveraging a slow zero-shot pose estimator to self-supervise the
training of a fast detection algorithm. This fast detector can then be used to
filter the input to the pose estimator, drastically improving its inference

existing zero-shot detection methods on two widely used object pose estimation
and detection datasets, without requiring any human annotations. Further, we
show that the resulting method for pose estimation has a significantly faster

Thus, our method for self-supervised online learning of a detector (trained
using pseudo-labels from a slow pose estimator) leads to accurate pose
estimation at real-time speeds, without requiring human annotations.

been an unsolved question of high-energy astrophysics. One approach for solving
this puzzle is to correlate UHECRs with high-energy neutrinos, since neutrinos
are a direct probe of hadronic interactions of cosmic rays and are not
deflected by magnetic fields. In this paper, we present three different
approaches for correlating the arrival directions of neutrinos with the arrival
directions of UHECRs. The neutrino data is provided by the IceCube Neutrino
Observatory and ANTARES, while the UHECR data with energies above $\sim$50 EeV
is provided by the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array. All
experiments provide increased statistics and improved reconstructions with
respect to our previous results reported in 2015. The first analysis uses a
high-statistics neutrino sample optimized for point-source searches to search
for excesses of neutrinos clustering in the vicinity of UHECR directions. The
second analysis searches for an excess of UHECRs in the direction of the
highest-energy neutrinos. The third analysis searches for an excess of pairs of
UHECRs and highest-energy neutrinos on different angular scales. None of the
analyses has found a significant excess, and previously reported
over-fluctuations are reduced in significance. Based on these results, we
further constrain the neutrino flux spatially correlated with UHECRs.

spectral functions of (quasi) one-dimensional spin chains, working directly in
momentum space in the thermodynamic limit. We simulate the time evolution after
applying a momentum operator to an MPS ground state by working with the
momentum superposition of a window MPS. We show explicitly for the spin-1
Heisenberg chain that the growth of entanglement is smaller in momentum space,
even inside a two-particle continuum, such that we can attain very accurate
spectral functions with relatively small bond dimension. We apply our method to
compute spectral lineshapes of the gapless XXZ chain and the square-lattice
J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a six-leg cylinder.

deuterated species in 16 Class 0/I proto-brown dwarfs (proto-BDs) and 4 Class
Flat/Class II brown dwarfs. Observations were obtained with the IRAM 30m
telescope in the DCO$^{+}$ (3-2), DCN (3-2), DNC (3-2), and N$_{2}$D$^{+}$
(3-2) lines. The DCO$^{+}$/H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$, DCN/H$^{13}$CN, and DNC/HN$^{13}$C
ratios are comparatively higher and show a narrower range than the
DCO$^{+}$/HCO$^{+}$, DCN/HCN, and DNC/HNC ratios, respectively. The mean D/H
ratios for the proto-BDs derived from these molecules are in the range of
$\sim$0.02-3. Both low-temperature gas-phase ion-molecule deuteron transfer and
grain surface reactions are required to explain the enhanced deuterium
fractionation. The very dense and cold ($n_{H_{2}}$ $\geq$10$^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$, T
$\leq$10 K) interior of the proto-BDs provide the suitable conditions for
efficient deuterium fractionation in these cores. There is no correlation
between the D/H ratios and the CO depletion factor, with the exception of the
DCN/HCN ratios that show a strong anti-correlation possibly due to the
difference in the peak emitting regions of the DCN and HCN molecules. Over a
wide range in the bolometric luminosities spanning $\sim$0.002--40 L$_{\odot}$,
we find a trend of higher DCO$^{+}$/HCO$^{+}$ (r = -0.7) and DCN/HCN (r = -0.6)
ratios, nearly constant DNC/HNC (r = -0.4) and DNC/HN$^{13}$C (r = -0.1)
ratios, lower N$_{2}$D$^{+}$/N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ ratios (r = 0.6) in the proto-BDs
compared to protostars. Only one Class II brown dwarf shows emission in the
DCO$^{+}$ (3-2) line. No correlation is seen between the D/H ratios and the

within FL that is concerned with grouping together data that is globally
similar while keeping all data local. We describe how this area of research can
be of interest in itself, or how it helps addressing issues like
non-independently-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) data in supervised FL
frameworks. The focus of this work, however, is an extension of the federated
fuzzy $c$-means algorithm to the FL setting (FFCM) as a contribution towards
federated clustering. We propose two methods to calculate global cluster
centers and evaluate their behaviour through challenging numerical experiments.
We observe that one of the methods is able to identify good global clusters
even in challenging scenarios, but also acknowledge that many challenges remain

domain data to the distribution of the source domain to mitigate the
distribution shift problem. The standard UDA requires sharing the source data
with the target, having potential data privacy leaking risks. To protect the
source data's privacy, we first propose to share the source feature
distribution instead of the source data. However, sharing only the source
feature distribution may still suffer from the membership inference attack who
can infer an individual's membership by the black-box access to the source
model. To resolve this privacy issue, we further study the under-explored
problem of privacy-preserving domain adaptation and propose a method with a
novel differential privacy training strategy to protect the source data
privacy. We model the source feature distribution by Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) under the differential privacy setting and send it to the target client
for adaptation. The target client resamples differentially private source
features from GMMs and adapts on target data with several state-of-art UDA
backbones. With our proposed method, the source data provider could avoid
leaking source data privacy during domain adaptation as well as reserve the
utility. To evaluate our proposed method's utility and privacy loss, we apply
our model on a medical report disease label classification task using two noisy
challenging clinical text datasets. The results show that our proposed method
can preserve source data's privacy with a minor performance influence on the
text classification task.

establishes three interfacial boundary conditions to connect the temperature,
density, and pressure jumps at the liquid-vapor interface to the interfacial
mass and heat fluxes: one for the mass flux (the Schrage equation), one for the
heat flux, and the third for the density discontinuities. These expressions can
be readily coupled to heat and mass transport equations in the continuum of the
liquid and the vapor phases, enabling one to determine the values of the
interfacial temperature, density, and pressure jumps. Comparison with past

thermionic emission of electrons, is also presented to gain more

inference about slope parameters $\gamma$ in linear regression models with a
structural break. In contrast to the conventional approach to inference about
$\gamma$ that does not take into account the uncertainty of the unknown break
location $\tau$, the Bayesian approach that we consider incorporates such
uncertainty. Our main theoretical contribution is a Bernstein-von Mises type
theorem (Bayesian asymptotic normality) for $\gamma$ under a wide class of
priors, which essentially indicates an asymptotic equivalence between the
conventional frequentist and Bayesian inference. Consequently, a frequentist
researcher could look at credible intervals of $\gamma$ to check robustness
with respect to the uncertainty of $\tau$. Simulation studies show that the
conventional confidence intervals of $\gamma$ tend to undercover in finite
samples whereas the credible intervals offer more reasonable coverages in
general. As the sample size increases, the two methods coincide, as predicted
from our theoretical conclusion. Using data from Paye and Timmermann (2006) on
stock return prediction, we illustrate that the traditional confidence
intervals on $\gamma$ might underrepresent the true sampling uncertainty.

Time windows where certain brain circuits are particularly receptive to
external stimuli, resulting in heightened plasticity, are referred to as
critical periods. Sleep is thought to be essential for normal brain
development. Importantly, studies have shown that sleep enhances critical
period plasticity and promotes experience-dependent synaptic pruning in the
developing mammalian brain. Therefore, normal plasticity during critical
periods depends on proper sleep. Problems falling and staying asleep occur at a
higher rate in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) relative to typical development.
In this review, we explore the potential link between sleep, critical period
plasticity, and ASD. First, we review the importance of critical period
plasticity in typical development and the role of sleep in this process. Next,
we summarize the evidence linking ASD with deficits in synaptic plasticity in
rodent models of high-confident ASD gene candidates. We then show that almost
all the high-confidence rodent models of ASD that show sleep deficits also
display plasticity deficits. Given how important sleep is for critical period
plasticity, it is essential to understand the connections between synaptic
plasticity, sleep, and brain development in ASD. However, studies investigating
sleep or plasticity during critical periods in ASD mouse models are lacking.
Therefore, we highlight an urgent need to consider developmental trajectory in
studies of sleep and plasticity in neurodevelopmental disorders.

to support the strategic vaccine distribution. The machine learning-based risk
prediction model characterizes how the risk is influenced by the underlying
essential factors, e.g., the vaccination level among the population in each

vaccine distribution strategy that simultaneously minimizes the resulting risks
while maximizing the vaccination coverage in these countries targeted by COVAX.

of the velocity fields revealed the rotation motion in the envelope and the
velocity gradients in the outflows (about 2000 au down to 50 au). We further
investigated the rotation of the circum-binary VLA 1623A disk as well as the
VLA 1623B disk. We found that the minor axis of the circum-binary disk of VLA
1623A is misaligned by about 12 degrees with respect to the large-scale outflow
and the rotation axis of the envelope. In contrast, the minor axis of the
circum-binary disk is parallel to the large-scale magnetic field according to
previous dust polarization observations, suggesting that the misalignment may
be caused by the different directions of the envelope rotation and the magnetic
field. If the velocity gradient of the outflow is caused by rotation, the
outflow has a constant angular momentum and the launching radius is estimated
to be $5-16$ au, although it cannot be ruled out that the velocity gradient is
driven by entrainments of the two high-velocity outflows. Furthermore, we
detected for the first time a velocity gradient associated with rotation toward
the VLA 16293B disk. The velocity gradient is opposite to the one from the
large-scale envelope, outflow, and circum-binary disk. The origin of its
opposite gradient is also discussed.

interest in various disciplines of science and engineering, including
astrophyics, atmospheric sciences and climate, geophysics, and fusion energy.
Analytical methods cannot be applied to explain the long-time behavior of
Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and therefore numerical simulation of the full
problem is required. However, in order to capture the growth of amplitude of
perturbations accurately, both the spatial and temporal discretization need to
be extremely fine for traditional numerical methods, and the long-time
simulation may become prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose
efficient reduced order model techniques to accelerate the simulation of
Rayleigh-Taylor instability in compressible gas dynamics. We introduce a
general framework for decomposing the solution manifold to construct the
temporal domain partition and temporally-local reduced order model construction
with varying Atwood number. We propose two practical approaches in this
framework, namely decomposition by using physical time and penetration distance
respectively. Numerical results are presented to examine the performance of the

medical challenges. The ability to design novel proteins tailored for specific

advances in the field of artificial intelligence are now setting the stage to
make this goal achievable. Protein sequences are inherently similar to natural
languages: Amino acids arrange in a multitude of combinations to form
structures that carry function, the same way as letters form words and
sentences that carry meaning. Therefore, it is not surprising that throughout
the history of Natural Language Processing (NLP), many of its techniques have
been applied to protein research problems. In the last few years, we have
witnessed revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of NLP. The implementation
of Transformer pre-trained models has enabled text generation with human-like
capabilities, including texts with specific properties such as style or
subject. Motivated by its considerable success in NLP tasks, we expect
dedicated Transformers to dominate custom protein sequence generation in the
near future. Finetuning pre-trained models on protein families will enable the
extension of their repertoires with novel sequences that could be highly
divergent but still potentially functional. The combination of control tags
such as cellular compartment or function will further enable the controllable
design of novel protein functions. Moreover, recent model interpretability
methods will allow us to open the 'black box' and thus enhance our
understanding of folding principles. While early initiatives show the enormous
potential of generative language models to design functional sequences, the
field is still in its infancy. We believe that protein language models are a
promising and largely unexplored field and discuss their foreseeable impact on

any correlations between their current turbulence and their past star formation

between the HI turbulence measures and the star formation rate 100-200 Myrs

due to the high cost of annotation. Thus, it is desirable to learn a robust and
transferable representation in an unsupervised manner to benefit tasks that
lack labeled data. Unlike natural images, medical images have their own domain
prior; e.g., we observe that many pulmonary diseases, such as the COVID-19,
manifest as changes in the lung tissue texture rather than the anatomical
structure. Therefore, we hypothesize that studying only the texture without the
influence of structure variations would be advantageous for downstream
prognostic and predictive modeling tasks. In this paper, we propose a
generative framework, the Lung Swapping Autoencoder (LSAE), that learns
factorized representations of a CXR to disentangle the texture factor from the
structure factor. Specifically, by adversarial training, the LSAE is optimized
to generate a hybrid image that preserves the lung shape in one image but
inherits the lung texture of another. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
disentangled texture representation, we evaluate the texture encoder $Enc^t$ in
LSAE on ChestX-ray14 (N=112,120), and our own multi-institutional COVID-19
outcome prediction dataset, COVOC (N=340 (Subset-1) + 53 (Subset-2)). On both
datasets, we reach or surpass the state-of-the-art by finetuning $Enc^t$ in
LSAE that is 77% smaller than a baseline Inception v3. Additionally, in
semi-and-self supervised settings with a similar model budget, $Enc^t$ in LSAE
is also competitive with the state-of-the-art MoCo. By ""re-mixing"" the texture
and shape factors, we generate meaningful hybrid images that can augment the
training set. This data augmentation method can further improve COVOC
prediction performance. The improvement is consistent even when we directly
evaluate the Subset-1 trained model on Subset-2 without any fine-tuning.

1) data augmentation (DA), 2) CNN with group convolutions (GCNN), and 3) loss
functions that enforce a global enstrophy-transfer conservation (EnsCon). While
the data-driven closures from physics-agnostic CNNs trained in the big-data
regime are accurate and stable, and outperform dynamic Smagorinsky (DSMAG)
closures, their performance substantially deteriorate when these CNNs are
trained with 40x fewer samples (the small-data regime). We show that CNN with
DA and GCNN address this issue and each produce accurate and stable data-driven
closures in the small-data regime. Despite its simplicity, DA, which adds
appropriately rotated samples to the training set, performs as well or in some
cases even better than GCNN, which uses a sophisticated equivariance-preserving
architecture. EnsCon, which combines structural modeling with aspect of
functional modeling, also produces accurate and stable closures in the
small-data regime. Overall, GCNN+EnCon, which combines these two physics
constraints, shows the best {\it a posteriori} performance in this regime.

small-data regime for accurate and stable LES.

density measurements for each object. Our suite of Python tools for modeling
the radio spectra is publicly available on Github. Our primary result is that
most (61%) of the sample have peaked or curved radio spectra and many (36%)
could be classified as Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) sources. This indicates
compact emission regions likely arising from recently triggered radio jets.
Assuming synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) generates the peaks, we infer
compact source sizes ($3 - 100$ pc) with strong magnetic fields ($6 - 100$ mG)
and young ages ($30 - 10^4$ years). Conversely, free-free absorption (FFA)
could also create peaks due to the high column densities associated with the
deeply embedded nature of the sample. However, we find no correlations between
the existence or frequency of the peaks and any parameters of the MIR emission.
The high-frequency spectral indices are steep ($\alpha \approx -1$) and
correlate, weakly, with the ratio of MIR photon energy density to magnetic
energy density, suggesting that the spectral steepening could arise from
inverse Compton scattering off the intense MIR photon field. This study
provides a foundation for combining multi-frequency and mixed-resolution radio
survey data for understanding the impact of young radio jets on the ISM and

\ldots, h_n$ satisfying $\sum_i h_i = 1$. During a given unit of time, each
bamboo grows by $h_i$, and then the bamboo-trimming algorithm gets to trim one
of the bamboo back down to height zero. The goal is to minimize the height of
the tallest bamboo, also known as the backlog. The bamboo trimming problem is
closely related to many scheduling problems, and can be viewed as a variation
of the widely-studied fixed-rate cup game, but with constant-factor resource
augmentation.
  Past work has given sophisticated pinwheel algorithms that achieve the
optimal backlog of 2 in the bamboo trimming problem. It remained an open
question, however, whether there exists a simple algorithm with the same
guarantee -- recent work has devoted considerable theoretical and experimental
effort to answering this question. Two algorithms, in particular, have appeared
as natural candidates: the Reduce-Max algorithm (which always cuts the tallest
bamboo) and the Reduce-Fastest$(x)$ algorithm (which cuts the fastest-growing
bamboo out of those that have height at least $x$). Both algorithms are
conjectured to achieve backlog 2.
  This paper improves the bounds for both Reduce-Fastest and Reduce-Max. Among
other results, we show that the exact optimal backlog for Reduce-Fastest$(x)$
is $x + 1$ for all $x \ge 2$ (proving a conjecture of D'Emidio, Di Stefano, and
Navarra in the case of $x = 2$), and we show that Reduce-Fastest$(1)$ does not
achieve backlog 2 (disproving a conjecture of D'Emidio, Di Stefano, and
Navarra).
  Finally, we show that there is a different algorithm, which we call the
Deadline-Driven Strategy, that is both very simple and achieves the optimal
backlog of 2. This resolves the question as to whether there exists a simple
worst-case optimal algorithm for the bamboo trimming problem.

restriction. This has exposed organizational networks to DDoS, exfiltration,
and reflection attacks, inflicting significant financial and reputational
damage. Large organizations with loosely federated IT departments (e.g.,
Universities and Research Institutes) often do not even fully aware of all
their DNS assets and vulnerabilities, let alone the attack surface they expose
to the outside world. In this paper, we address the ""DNS blind spot"" by
developing methods to passively analyze live DNS traffic, identify
organizational DNS assets, and monitor their health on a continuous basis. Our
contributions are threefold. First, we perform a comprehensive analysis of all
DNS traffic in two large organizations (a University Campus and a Government
Research Institute) for over a month, and identify key behavioral profiles for
various asset types such as recursive resolvers, authoritative name servers,
and mixed DNS servers. Second, we develop an unsupervised clustering method
that classifies enterprise DNS assets using the behavioral attributes
identified, and demonstrate that our method successfully classifies over 100
DNS assets across the two organizations. Third, our method continuously tracks
various health metrics across the organizational DNS assets and identifies
several instances of improper configuration, data exfiltration, DDoS, and
reflection attacks. We believe the passive analysis methods in this paper can
help enterprises monitor organizational DNS health in an automated and
risk-free manner.

to a single glioma cell, and the dynamics of these multi-cellular conjugates.
Our model more accurately describes experimentally observed CAR T-cell killing

precisely interfere such that the optical-path and angular differences between
the two beams are reduced at the wavelength level. Herein, we propose a novel
beam combiner for space interferometers that records the spectrally-resolved
interferometric fringes using the densified pupil spectroscopic technique. As
the detector plane is optically conjugated to a plane, on which the two beams
interfere, we can directly measure the relative phase difference between the
two beams. Additionally, when an object within the field of view is obtained
with a modest signal-to-noise ratio, we can extract the true complex amplitude
from a continuous broadband fringe (i.e., one exposure measurement), without
scanning a delay line and chopping interferometry. We discovered that this
spectral imaging method is validated for observing the solar system objects by
simulating the reflected light from Europa with a small stellar interferometer.
However, because the structure of the object spectrum may cause a systematic
error in the measurement, this method may be limited in extracting the true
complex amplitude for other astronomical objects. Applying this spectral
imaging method to general astrophysics will facilitate further research. The
beam combiner and spectral imaging method are applied to a formation-flying
stellar interferometer with multiple small satellites in a Sun-synchronous
orbit for observation of the solar system objects in visible and near-infrared.

Although we included cone-shaped coronae in the funnel regions above and below

very large version of this corona that makes it possible to Comptonize a

generally assumes that the future resembles the past: intelligent agents or
systems (what we call 'intelligence') observe and act on the world, then use
this experience to act on future experiences of the same kind. We call this
'retrospective learning'. For example, an intelligence may see a set of
pictures of objects, along with their names, and learn to name them. A
retrospective learning intelligence would merely be able to name more pictures
of the same objects. We argue that this is not what true intelligence is about.
In many real world problems, both NIs and AIs will have to learn for an
uncertain future. Both must update their internal models to be useful for
future tasks, such as naming fundamentally new objects and using these objects
effectively in a new context or to achieve previously unencountered goals. This
ability to learn for the future we call 'prospective learning'. We articulate
four relevant factors that jointly define prospective learning. Continual
learning enables intelligences to remember those aspects of the past which it
believes will be most useful in the future. Prospective constraints (including
biases and priors) facilitate the intelligence finding general solutions that
will be applicable to future problems. Curiosity motivates taking actions that
inform future decision making, including in previously unmet situations. Causal
estimation enables learning the structure of relations that guide choosing
actions for specific outcomes, even when the specific action-outcome
contingencies have never been observed before. We argue that a paradigm shift
from retrospective to prospective learning will enable the communities that
study intelligence to unite and overcome existing bottlenecks to more
effectively explain, augment, and engineer intelligences.

an appropriate framework for developing the relational calculus. Two other
papers represent FOLE in an interpretation form: the first paper [8] develops
the notion of the FOLE table following the relational model [3]; the second
paper [9] discusses the notion of a FOLE relational database. All the
operations of the relational algebra have been rigorously developed [10] using
the interpretation form of FOLE. The present study demonstrates that the

provides a rich source for querying in various location-based services. An
important class of queries within such services involves the association

streaming geo-tagged data: 1) ""Top-k reverse frequent spatial queries"", where
given a term, the goal is to find top K locations where the term is frequent,
and 2) ""Term frequency spatial queries"", which is finding the expected
frequency of a term in a given location. To efficiently support these queries
in a streaming setting, we model terms as events and explore a probabilistic
model of geographical distribution that allows us to estimate the frequency of
terms in locations that are not kept in a stream sketch or summary. We study
the back-and-forth relationship between the efficiency of queries, the
efficiency of updates and the accuracy of the results and identify some sweet

demonstrate that our method can be extended to support multi-term queries. To
evaluate the efficiency of our algorithms, we conduct experiments on a

accuracy when only a limited amount of memory is given. Also the query time is
improved, compared to a recent baseline, by 2-3 orders of magnitude without
much loss in accuracy and that the update time can further be improved by at
least an order of magnitude under some term distributions or update strategies.

requires enormous bandwidth for backhauling, we propose to use the
sub-terahertz (sub-THz) band for the backhaul links between UAV-BSs and central
processing unit (CPU). Also, because the sub-THz band requires a reliable
line-of-sight link, we propose to use a high altitude platform station (HAPS)
as a CPU. At the first time-slot of the proposed scheme, users send their
messages to UAVs at the sub-6 GHz band. The UAVs then apply match-filtering and
power allocation. At the second time-slot, at each UAV, orthogonal resource
blocks are allocated for each user at the sub-THz band, and the signals are
sent to the HAPS after analog beamforming. In the HAPS receiver, after analog
beamforming, the message of each user is decoded. We formulate an optimization
problem that maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of
users by finding the optimum allocated power as well as the optimum locations
of UAVs. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme

Despite the good performance of such models under the common intra-project
independent and identically distributed (IID) training and validation setting,
we observe that they usually fail to generalize to real-world inter-project
out-of-distribution (OOD) setting. In this work, we show that such phenomenon
is caused by model heavily relying on project-specific, ungeneralizable tokens
like self-defined variable and function names for downstream prediction, and we
formulate it as the project-specific bias learning behavior. We propose a
measurement to interpret such behavior, termed as Cond-Idf, which combines
co-occurrence probability and inverse document frequency to measure the level
of relatedness of token with label and its project-specificness. The
approximation indicates that without proper regularization with prior
knowledge, model tends to leverage spurious statistical cues for prediction.
Equipped with these observations, we propose a bias mitigation mechanism Batch
Partition Regularization (BPR) that regularizes model to infer based on proper
behavior by leveraging latent logic relations among samples. Experimental
results on two deep code benchmarks indicate that BPR can improve both
inter-project OOD generalization and adversarial robustness while not

hierarchical latent representations is useful to better predict the class
labels of examples; (2) the idea of preassigned model on unseen datapoints is
not suitable for modeling streaming data with evolving probability

this in minds, the online deep learning model we need to design should have a
variable underlying structure; (3) moreover, it is of utmost importance to
fusion these abstract hierarchical latent representations to achieve better
classification performance, and we should give different weights to different

single-antenna users via general multicast. We consider linear beamforming at
the BS and joint decoding at each user in the slow fading and fast fading
scenarios. In the slow fading scenario, we consider the maximization of the
weighted sum average rate, which is a challenging nonconvex stochastic problem
with numerous variables. To reduce computational complexity, we decouple the
original nonconvex stochastic problem into multiple nonconvex deterministic
problems, one for each system channel state. Then, we propose an iterative
algorithm for each deterministic problem to obtain a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)

we consider the maximization of the weighted sum ergodic rate. This problem is
more challenging than the one for the slow fading scenario, as it is not
separable. First, we propose a stochastic iterative algorithm to obtain a KKT

penalty method. Then, we propose two low-complexity iterative algorithms to
obtain feasible points with promising performance for two cases of channel

range of 3.4\,--\,5.2\,Mm, with an average value of 4.5\,Mm. The periods are

direct numerical simulation (DNS) of air-water two-phase turbulent flow. The
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for air and water sides are solved using
an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method with boundary-fitted moving grids. The
wave growth of finite-amplitude and non-breaking gravity--capillary waves,
whose wavelength is less than 0.07 m, is simulated for two cases of different
surface tensions under a low--wind speed condition of several meters per
second. The results show that significant wave height for the smaller surface
tension case increases faster than that for the larger surface tension case.
Energy fluxes for gravity and capillary wave scales reveal that, when the
surface tension is reduced, the energy transfer from the significant gravity
waves to capillary waves decreases and the significant waves accumulate more
energy supplied by wind. This results in faster wave growth for the smaller
surface tension case. Effect on the scalar transfer across the air-water
interface is also investigated. The results show that the scalar transfer
coefficient on the water side decreases due to the surface tension reduction.
The decrease is caused by suppression of turbulence in the water side. In order
to support the conjecture, the surface tension effect is compared with
laboratory experiments in a small wind-wave tank.

commonly based on adversarial examples constructed for the owner's model as the
\textit{fingerprint}, and verify whether a suspect model is indeed pirated from
the original model by matching the behavioral pattern on the fingerprint
examples between one another. However, these methods heavily rely on the
characteristics of classification tasks which inhibits their application to
more general scenarios. To address this issue, we present MetaV, the first
task-agnostic model fingerprinting framework which enables fingerprinting on a
much wider range of DNNs independent from the downstream learning task, and
exhibits strong robustness against a variety of ownership obfuscation
techniques. Specifically, we generalize previous schemes into two critical
design components in MetaV: the \textit{adaptive fingerprint} and the
\textit{meta-verifier}, which are jointly optimized such that the meta-verifier
learns to determine whether a suspect model is stolen based on the concatenated
outputs of the suspect model on the adaptive fingerprint. As a key of being
task-agnostic, the full process makes no assumption on the model internals in
the ensemble only if they have the same input and output dimensions. Spanning
classification, regression and generative modeling, extensive experimental
results validate the substantially improved performance of MetaV over the
state-of-the-art fingerprinting schemes and demonstrate the enhanced generality
of MetaV for providing task-agnostic fingerprinting. For example, on
fingerprinting ResNet-18 trained for skin cancer diagnosis, MetaV achieves
simultaneously $100\%$ true positives and $100\%$ true negatives on a diverse
test set of $70$ suspect models, achieving an about $220\%$ relative
improvement in ARUC in comparison to the optimal baseline.

we propose a double-RIS-assisted coexistence system where two RISs are deployed

to jointly optimize the beamforming of RISs and radar to maximize communication
performance while maintaining radar detection performance. The investigated
problem is challenging, and thus we transform it into an equivalent but more

dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm to solve the resultant problem.
Moreover, we consider two special cases: the large radar transmit power
scenario and the low radar transmit power scenario. For the former, we prove
that the beamforming design is only determined by the communication channel and
the corresponding optimal joint beamforming strategy can be obtained in
closed-form. For the latter, we minimize the mutual interference via the block

a low-complexity algorithm is also developed. Finally, simulation results show

address real-world problems and achieves huge success in the graph learning
domain. Graph contrastive learning is one of the unsupervised graph
representation learning methods, which recently attracts attention from
researchers and has achieved state-of-the-art performances on various tasks.
The key to the success of graph contrastive learning is to construct proper
contrasting pairs to acquire the underlying structural semantics of the graph.
However, this key part is not fully explored currently, most of the ways
generating contrasting pairs focus on augmenting or perturbating graph
structures to obtain different views of the input graph. But such strategies
could degrade the performances via adding noise into the graph, which may
narrow down the field of the applications of graph contrastive learning. In
this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning method, namely
\textbf{D}ual \textbf{S}pace \textbf{G}raph \textbf{C}ontrastive (DSGC)
Learning, to conduct graph contrastive learning among views generated in
different spaces including the hyperbolic space and the Euclidean space. Since
both spaces have their own advantages to represent graph data in the embedding
spaces, we hope to utilize graph contrastive learning to bridge the spaces and
leverage advantages from both sides. The comparison experiment results show
that DSGC achieves competitive or better performances among all the datasets.
In addition, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impact of
different graph encoders on DSGC, giving insights about how to better leverage
the advantages of contrastive learning between different spaces.

N-well CMOS technology using 5V MOS transistors, has a wide linear operating
range of 2.6 pC w.r.t the input charge with a power dissipation of 2.3 mW. A
noise figure (ENC) of 820 e$^-$ at 0 pF of detector capacitance with a noise
slope of 25 e$^-$/pF has been achieved (when followed by a CR-RC$^2$ filter of
1.2 $\mu$s peaking time). This design of CSA provides a dynamic range (ratio of
maximum detectable signal to noise floor) of 79 dB for the maximum input charge
of 2.6 pC when connected to a silicon detector with a capacitance of 40 pF.
Using folded cascode architecture-based input stage and low voltage high swing
current mirrors as the load, the CSA provides an enlarged output swing when
biasing the output node towards one supply rail and utilizing the voltage range
towards the opposite rail. The design philosophy works for both polarities of a
large input signal. This paper presents the design of CSA with a wide negative
output swing for an anticipated input signal of positive polarity in the target
application with a known detector biasing scheme.

overall distribution of the [CI] (1-0) emission is consistent with the CO
(1-0). While the [CI] (1-0) and CO (1-0) luminosities of the system follow the
empirical linear relation for the unresolved ULIRG sample, we find a sublinear
relation between [CI] (1-0) and CO (1-0) using the spatially-resolved data. We
measure the [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratio per pixel in star-forming
environments of Arp 220 and investigate its dependence on the CO (3-2)/CO (1-0)
ratio ($R_{\rm CO}$). On average, the [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratio is
almost constant up to $R_{\rm CO} \simeq 1$ and then increases with $R_{\rm
CO}$. According to the radiative transfer analysis, a high CI/CO abundance
ratio is required in regions with high [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratios
and $R_{\rm CO} > 1$, suggesting that the CI/CO abundance ratio varies at
$\sim$100 pc scale in Arp 220. The [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0) luminosity ratio depends
on multiple factors and may not be straightforward to interpret. We also find
the high-velocity components traced by [CI] (1-0) in the western nucleus,
likely associated with the molecular outflow. The [CI] (1-0)/CO (1-0)
luminosity ratio in the putative outflow is 0.87 $\pm$ 0.28, which is four
times higher than the average ratio of Arp 220. While there is a possibility
that the [CI] (1-0) and CO (1-0) emission traces different components, we
suggest that the high line ratios are likely because of elevated CI/CO
abundance ratios based on our radiative transfer analysis. A CI-rich and
CO-poor gas phase in outflows could be caused by the irradiation of the cosmic
rays, the shock heating, and the intense radiation field.

exist, envy-freeness can be achieved by additionally providing some subsidy to
the agents. These subsidies can be alternatively viewed as a divisible good
(money) that is fractionally assigned among the agents to realize an envy-free
outcome. In this setup, we bound the subsidy required to attain envy-freeness
among agents with dichotomous valuations, i.e., among agents whose marginal
value for any good is either zero or one.
  We prove that, under dichotomous valuations, there exists an allocation that
achieves envy-freeness with a per-agent subsidy of either $0$ or $1$.
Furthermore, such an envy-free solution can be computed efficiently in the
standard value-oracle model. Notably, our results hold for general dichotomous
valuations and, in particular, do not require the (dichotomous) valuations to
be additive, submodular, or even subadditive. Also, our subsidy bounds are
tight and provide a linear (in the number of agents) factor improvement over
the bounds known for general monotone valuations.

much effort, existing approaches target on matching the binary code and source

y^\top A x - h(y)$, where $f$ and $h$ are both strongly convex smooth functions
and admit first-order gradient oracles. Surprisingly, no known first-order
algorithms have hitherto achieved the lower complexity bound of
$\Omega((\sqrt{\frac{L_x}{\mu_x}} + \frac{\|A\|}{\sqrt{\mu_x \mu_y}} +
\sqrt{\frac{L_y}{\mu_y}}) \log(\frac1{\varepsilon}))$ for solving this problem
up to an $\varepsilon$ primal-dual gap in the general parameter regime, where
$L_x, L_y,\mu_x,\mu_y$ are the corresponding smoothness and strongly convexity
constants.
  We close this gap by devising the first optimal algorithm, the Lifted
Primal-Dual (LPD) method. Our method lifts the objective into an extended form
that allows both the smooth terms and the bilinear term to be handled optimally
and seamlessly with the same primal-dual framework. Besides optimality, our
method yields a desirably simple single-loop algorithm that uses only one
gradient oracle call per iteration. Moreover, when $f$ is just convex, the same
algorithm applied to a smoothed objective achieves the nearly optimal iteration
complexity. We also provide a direct single-loop algorithm, using the LPD
method, that achieves the iteration complexity of
$O(\sqrt{\frac{L_x}{\varepsilon}} + \frac{\|A\|}{\sqrt{\mu_y \varepsilon}} +
\sqrt{\frac{L_y}{\varepsilon}})$. Numerical experiments on quadratic minimax
problems and policy evaluation problems further demonstrate the fast
convergence of our algorithm in practice.

and improve imaging performance in parallel imaging. Nevertheless, the
increasing growth of coil number simultaneously aggravates the drawbacks of
data storage and reconstruction speed, especially in some iterative
reconstructions. Coil compression addresses these issues by generating fewer
virtual coils. In this work, a novel variable augmentation network for
invertible coil compression termed VAN-ICC is presented. It utilizes inherent
reversibility of normalizing flow-based models for high-precision compression
and invertible recovery. By employing the variable augmentation technology to
image/k-space variables from multi-coils, VAN-ICC trains invertible networks by
finding an invertible and bijective function, which can map the original data
to the compressed counterpart and vice versa. Experiments conducted on both
fully-sampled and under-sampled data verified the effectiveness and flexibility
of VAN-ICC. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons with traditional non-deep
learning-based approaches demonstrated that VAN-ICC can carry much higher
compression effects. Additionally, its performance is not susceptible to
different number of virtual coils.

information processing. While significant progress has been achieved in recent
years, existing implementations typically rely on dedicated structures that are
predesigned to modulate the phases and intensities of optical beams accurately
for specific logic functions. Thus, these optical gates usually lack
reconfigurability and are incapable within or through dynamic complex
media/environment, such as fog and turbid water. In this work, as a conceptual
demonstration, we propose reconfigurable optical logic operations through
scattering media with transmission matrix-based wavefront shaping. A light beam
is reflected by a spatial light modulator divided into several subregions
functioning as logic units, with each displayed with predetermined wavefronts
via transmission matrix-based wavefront shaping. Each modulated wavefront
transmits through the scattering medium to form a desired light field. The
interference of these light fields generates bright optical focus at
pre-assigned locations, representing different logic states. As a proof of
concept, we experimentally demonstrate five basic logic functions (AND, OR,
NOT, NAND, NOR). As the transmission matrix of the scattering medium/system can
be measured instantly to adapt to environment perturbation, the method, if
further engineered, opens new venues towards reconfigurable optical logic

Historically, infrastructures for workflow execution consisted of complex,
integrated systems, developed in-house by workflow practitioners with strong
dependencies on a range of legacy technologies. Due to the increasing need to
support workflows, dedicated workflow systems were developed to provide
abstractions for creating, executing, and adapting workflows conveniently and
efficiently while ensuring portability. While these efforts are all worthwhile
individually, there are now hundreds of independent workflow systems. The
resulting workflow system technology landscape is fragmented, which may present
significant barriers for future workflow users due to many seemingly
comparable, yet usually mutually incompatible, systems that exist. In order to
tackle some of these challenges, the DOE-funded ExaWorks and NSF-funded
WorkflowsRI projects have organized in 2021 a series of events entitled the
""Workflows Community Summit"". The third edition of the ``Workflows Community
Summit"" explored workflows challenges and opportunities from the perspective of
computing centers and facilities. The third summit brought together a small
group of facilities representatives with the aim to understand how workflows

roadmaps, and what opportunities there are for tighter integration between

digital images via deep neural networks. However, existing deep image
steganography methods only consider the visual similarity of container images
to host images, and neglect the statistical security (stealthiness) of
container images. Besides, they usually hides data limited to image type and
thus relax the constraint of lossless extraction. In this paper, we address the
above issues in a unified manner, and propose deep image steganography that can
embed data with arbitrary types into images for secure data hiding and lossless
data revealing. First, we formulate the data hiding as an image colorization
problem, in which the data is binarized and further mapped into the color
information for a gray-scale host image. Second, we design a conditional
invertible neural network which uses gray-scale image as prior to guide the
color generation and perform data hiding in a secure way. Finally, to achieve
lossless data revealing, we present a multi-stage training scheme to manage the
data loss due to rounding errors between hiding and revealing processes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can perform secure
data hiding by generating realism color images and successfully resisting the
detection of steganalysis. Moreover, we can achieve 100% revealing accuracy in
different scenarios, indicating the practical utility of our steganography in
the real-world.

flows either treat both fluid phases as incompressible (constant density) or
treat both phases as compressible (variable density). This presents a
limitation for the prediction of many two-phase flows, such as subsonic fuel
injection, as treating both phases as compressible is computationally expensive
due to the very stiff pressure-density-temperature coupling of liquids. A
framework with the capability of treating one phase compressible and the other
phase incompressible, therefore, has a significant potential to improve the
computational performance and still capture all important physical mechanisms.
We propose a numerical algorithm that can simulate interfacial flows in all
Mach number regimes, ranging from $M=0$ to $M > 1$, including interfacial flows
in which compressible and incompressible fluids interact, within the same
pressure-based framework and conservative finite-volume discretisation. For
interfacial flows with only incompressible fluids or with only compressible
fluids, the proposed pressure-based algorithm and finite-volume discretisation
reduce to numerical frameworks that have already been presented in the
literature. Representative test cases are used to validate the proposed
algorithm, including mixed compressible-incompressible interfacial flows with
acoustic waves, shock waves and rarefaction fans.

optimization algorithms in many rapidly developing quantum technologies, where
the objective function is either computed by a natural quantum system or a
quantum ansatz that is engineered, but the optimizer is classical. In any
particular case, the nature of the underlying control landscape is
fundamentally important for systematic optimization of the objective. In early
studies on the optimal control of few-body dynamics, the optimizer could take
full control of the quantum systems to be manipulated whose Hilbert space
dimension is relatively small. Stepping into the noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) era, the experimentally growing computational power of the
ansatz expressed as quantum hardware may bring quantum advantage over classical
computers, but the classical optimizer is often limited by the available
control resources. Across these different scales, we will show that the
landscape's geometry experiences morphological changes from favorable trap-free
landscapes to easily trapping rugged landscapes, and eventually to
barren-plateau landscapes on which the optimizer can hardly move. This unified
view provides the basis for understanding classes of systems that may be
readily controlled out to those with special consideration, including the
difficulties and potential advantages of NISQ technologies, as well as seeking
possible ways to escape traps or plateaus, in particular circumstances.

images with complementary information to improve the richness of a single
image. Due to insufficient task-specific training data and corresponding ground
truth, most existing end-to-end image fusion methods easily fall into
overfitting or tedious parameter optimization processes. Two-stage methods
avoid the need of large amount of task-specific training data by training
encoder-decoder network on large natural image datasets and utilizing the
extracted features for fusion, but the domain gap between natural images and
different fusion tasks results in limited performance. In this study, we design
a novel encoder-decoder based image fusion framework and propose a
destruction-reconstruction based self-supervised training scheme to encourage
the network to learn task-specific features. Specifically, we propose three
destruction-reconstruction self-supervised auxiliary tasks for multi-modal
image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion and multi-focus image fusion based on
pixel intensity non-linear transformation, brightness transformation and noise
transformation, respectively. In order to encourage different fusion tasks to
promote each other and increase the generalizability of the trained network, we
integrate the three self-supervised auxiliary tasks by randomly choosing one of
them to destroy a natural image in model training. In addition, we design a new
encoder that combines CNN and Transformer for feature extraction, so that the
trained model can exploit both local and global information. Extensive
experiments on multi-modal image fusion, multi-exposure image fusion and
multi-focus image fusion tasks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
the state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations.

benchmark environments, where agents have been modeled using the Enforcers, we
find that a prototype-based method produces meaningful discrete tokens that
enable human partners to learn agent communication faster and better than a

heating and radiation. We investigate the kinematics and energetics of such
accretion shocks using 1D radiation hydrodynamic simulations. Our simulations
feature the first self-consistent treatment of hydrogen dissociation and
ionization, radiation transport, and realistic grey opacity. By exploring a
broad range of giant planet masses (0.1-3 M$_{J}$) and accretion rates
($10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$M$_{\oplus}\cdot\rm{yr}^{-1}$), we focus on global shock
efficiency and the final entropy of the accreted gas. We find that radiation
from the accretion shock can fully disassociate the molecular hydrogen of the
incoming gas when the shock luminosity is above a critical luminosity.
Meanwhile, the post-shock entropy generally fall into ""cold""

depends on the extent of the endothermic process of $\rm{H}_2$ dissociation.

apertures, rectangular and square shapes in a gold film filled with silicon
nanoantennas are sufficient to create two amplitude holograms at two different
wavelengths in the visible, multiplexed with an additional phase-only hologram.
The nanoantennas are tailored to adjust the spectral transmittance of the
apertures, enabling the wavelength sensitivity. The phase-only hologram is
implemented by utilizing the anisotropic rectangular structure. Interestingly,
such three holograms have quantitative mathematical correlations with each
other. Thus, the flexibility of polarization and wavelength channels can be
utilized with custom-tailored features to achieve such amplitude and phase
holography simultaneously without sacrificing any space-bandwidth product. The
present scheme has the potential to store different pieces of information which
can be displayed separately by switching the wavelength or the polarization
state of the reading light beam.

is a popular privacy-preserving data collection mechanism. In LDP, the data
collector could obtain accurate statistics without access to original data,
thus guaranteeing privacy. However, a primary drawback of LDP is its
disappointing utility in high-dimensional space. Although various LDP schemes
have been proposed to reduce perturbation, they share the same and naive
aggregation mechanism at the side of the collector. In this paper, we first
bring forward an analytical framework to generally measure the utilities of LDP
mechanisms in high-dimensional space, which can benchmark existing and future
LDP mechanisms without conducting any experiment. Based on this, the framework
further reveals that the naive aggregation is sub-optimal in high-dimensional
space, and there is much room for improvement. Motivated by this, we present a
re-calibration protocol HDR4ME for high-dimensional mean estimation, which
improves the utilities of existing LDP mechanisms without making any change to
them. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm the

entries the notion of rank of a matrix, bearing in mind that there are several
approaches to build such an extension. When the rank is one, the variables are

to approximate a given tensor by a tensor of lower rank, through a systematic
use of tensor algebra. The notion of tensor is rigorously defined, then
elementary but useful operations on tensors are presented. After recalling

problem today. Optical spectroscopic measurements appear to show that the
gas-phase metallicities of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) are
significantly lower than those of normal star-forming galaxies. This difference
has resulted in the claim that ULIRGs are fueled by metal-poor gas accretion
from the outskirts\cite{Mannucci10}. Here we report on a new set of gas-phase
metallicity measurements making use of the far-infrared spectral lines of
[O{\sc iii}]52 $\mu$m, [O{\sc iii}]88 $\mu$m, and [N{\sc iii}]57 $\mu$m instead
of the usual optical lines. Photoionization models have resulted in a
metallicity diagnostic based on these three lines that break the electron
density degeneracy and reduce the scatter of the correlation significantly.
Using new data from SOFIA and archival data from Herschel Space Observatory, we
find that local ULIRGs lie on the mass-metallicity relation of star-forming
galaxies and have metallicities comparable to other galaxies with similar
stellar masses and star formation rates. The lack of a departure suggests that
ULIRGs follow the same mass assembly mechanism as luminous star-forming
galaxies and $\sim 0.3$ dex under-abundance in metallicities derived from
optical lines is a result of heavily obscured metal-rich gas which has a
negligible effect when using the FIR line diagnostics.

proposed to interpret such a phenomenon based on the excitation of resonant
oscillations in the interior magnetic field of the star by a component of the
tidal potential with a very low frequency in the reference frame rotating with
the star. A magnetic flux tube located in the overshoot layer of the star is
assumed to study the excitation of the resonant oscillations in the
magnetostrophic regime. The model considers a planet on a circular oblique

system in resonance with the exciting potential, in spite of the variations in

observed close commensurability in eight of them by assuming a magnetic field
between $10^{2}$ and $10^{4}$ G. Systems with low-mass distant planets, such as
AU Mic and HAT-P-11, cannot be interpreted by the proposed model. Consequences

how accurately magneto-friction (without fluid pressure) is able to predict the
relaxed state in a one-dimensional test case containing two magnetic null
points. Firstly, we show that relaxation under the full ideal
magnetohydrodynamic equations in the presence of nulls leads necessarily to a
non-force-free state, which could not be reached exactly by magneto-friction.
Secondly, the magneto-frictional solutions are shown to lead to breakdown of
magnetic flux conservation, whether or not the friction coefficient is scaled
with magnetic field strength. When this coefficient is constant, flux is
initially conserved, but only until discontinuous current sheets form at the
null points. In the ensuing weak solution, we show that magnetic flux is
dissipated at these current sheets. The breakdown of flux conservation does not
occur for an alternative viscous relaxation scheme.

most effective representation methods for 3D models. By learning continuous
SDFs in 3D space, neural networks can predict the distance from a given query
space point to its closest object surface,whose positive and negative signs
denote inside and outside of the object, respectively. Training a specific
network for each 3D model, which individually embeds its shape, can realize
compressed representation of objects by storing fewer network (and possibly
latent) parameters. Consequently, reconstruction through network inference and
surface recovery can be achieved. In this paper, we propose an SDF prediction
network using explicit key spheres as input. Key spheres are extracted from the
internal space of objects, whose centers either have relatively larger SDF
values (sphere radii), or are located at essential positions. By inputting the
spatial information of multiple spheres which imply different local shapes, the
proposed method can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy with a
negligible storage cost. Compared to previous works, our method achieves the
high-fidelity and high-compression 3D object coding and reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on three datasets verify the superior performance of our
method.

challenge in many engineering fields, such as, communications, compressed

proposed by Donoho \textit{et al} is a computational efficient method to such
problems, which can attain Bayes-optimal performance in independent identical
distributed (IID) sub-Gaussian random matrices region. A significant feature of
AMP is that the dynamical behavior of AMP can be fully predicted by a scalar
equation termed station evolution (SE). Although AMP is optimal in IID
sub-Gaussian random matrices, AMP may fail to converge when measurement matrix
is beyond IID sub-Gaussian. To extend the region of random measurement matrix,
an expectation propagation (EP)-related algorithm orthogonal AMP (OAMP) was
proposed, which shares the same algorithm with EP, expectation consistent (EC),
and vector AMP (VAMP). This paper aims at giving a review for those algorithms.
We begin with the worst case, i.e., least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator (LASSO) inference problem, and then give the detailed derivation of
AMP derived from message passing. Also, in the Bayes-optimal setting, we give
the Bayes-optimal AMP which has a slight difference from AMP for LASSO. In

produced by a cluster of massive stars. Stellar winds, supernova remnants and
turbulence are found to accelerate particles so efficiently that the nonlinear
feedback of the particles must be taken into account in order to ensure that
the energy balance is not violated. High energy particles do not scatter
efficiently on the turbulence and escape quickly after each supernova
explosion, which makes both their intensity inside the bubble and injection in
the interstellar medium intermittent. On the other hand, the stochastic
acceleration of low energy particles hardens the spectra at GeV energies.
Because cosmic rays damp the turbulence cascade, this hardening is less
pronounced when nonlinearities are taken into account. Nevertheless, spectra
with hard components extending up to 1 to 10 GeV and normalised to an energy
density of 1 to 100 eV cm$^{-3}$ are found to be typical signatures of cosmic
rays produced in superbubbles. Efficient shock reacceleration within compact
clusters is further shown to produce hard, slightly concave spectra, while the
presence of a magnetised shell is shown to enhance the confinement of cosmic
rays in the bubble and therefore the collective plasma effects acting on them.
We eventually estimate the overall contribution of superbubbles to the galactic
cosmic ray content and show typical gamma-ray spectra expected from hadronic
interactions in superbuble shells. In both cases, a qualitative agreement with
observations is obtained.

macroscopic rheology of emulsions are investigated in a Taylor-Couette (TC)
turbulent shear flow. Although here oil and water in the emulsions have almost
the same physical properties (density and viscosity), unexpectedly, we find
that oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions have very distinct
hydrodynamic behaviors, i.e., the system is clearly asymmetric. By looking at
the micro-scales, the average droplet diameter hardly changes with the oil
volume fraction neither for O/W nor for W/O. However, for W/O it is about 50%
larger than that of O/W. At the macro-scales, the effective viscosity of O/W is
higher when compared to that of W/O. These asymmetric behaviors can be traced
back to the presence of surface-active contaminants in the system. By
introducing an oil-soluble surfactant at high concentration, remarkably, we
recover the symmetry (droplet size and effective viscosity) between O/W and W/O
emulsions. Based on this, we suggest a possible mechanism responsible for the
initial asymmetry. Next, we discuss what sets the droplet size in turbulent
emulsions. We uncover a -6/5 scaling dependence of the droplet size on the
Reynolds number of the flow. Combining the scaling dependence and the droplet
Weber number, we conclude that the droplet fragmentation, which determines the
droplet size, occurs within the boundary layer and is controlled by the dynamic
pressure caused by the gradient of the mean flow, as proposed by Levich (1962),
instead of the dynamic pressure due to turbulent fluctuations, as proposed by
Kolmogorov (1949). The present findings provide an understanding of both the
microscopic droplet formation and the macroscopic rheological behaviors in
dynamic emulsification, and connects them.

initial gauge theory proposed in our previous papers [1], [2] for closed/open
gauge algebras is extended to the case of reducible gauge algebras. The
deformation procedure is explicitly described with the help of generating
functions of anticanonical transformations depending on fields of the initial
gauge action only. The deformed gauge-invariant action and the deformed gauge
generators are described with the help of the generating functions in a closed
and simple form. As an example of reducible gauge systems we consider the free
fermionic p-form fields or, in another words, the antisymmetric tensor-spinor
fields. It is proved that gauge-invariant deformation of fermionic p-form
fields leads always to non-local deformed theory which does not contain a
closed local sector. In its turn the model based on two fermionic 2-form fields
and a real massive scalar field admits local interactions between these fields
in local sector of the deformed action.

as key building blocks in a growing number of materials with innovative

volume fractions in pure water, they aggregate in the presence of salt and form
colloidal gels with time-dependent properties. Here, we study the impact of
salt concentration on the slow aging dynamics of CNC gels following the
cessation of a high-shear flow that fully fluidizes the sample. We show that
the higher the salt content, the faster the recovery of elasticity upon flow
cessation. Most remarkably, the elastic modulus $G'$ obeys a time-composition
superposition principle: the temporal evolution of $G'$ can be rescaled onto a
universal sigmoidal master curve spanning 13 orders of magnitude in time for a
wide range of salt concentrations. Such a rescaling is obtained through a
time-shift factor that follows a steep power-law decay with increasing salt
concentration, until it saturates at large salt content. These findings are
robust to changes in the type of salt and in the CNC content. We further show
that both linear and nonlinear rheological properties of CNC gels of various
compositions, including, e.g., the frequency-dependence of viscoelastic spectra
and the yield strain, can be rescaled based on the sample age along the general
master curve. Our results provide strong evidence for universality in the aging
dynamics of CNC gels, and call for microstructural investigations during
recovery as well as theoretical modelling of time-composition superposition in
rodlike colloids.

On the basis of the downlink achievable spectral efficiency of the common and

influenced by their chemical composition, that, in turn, is determined by the
physico-chemical processes that govern the transition between the gas phase and
the solid state, specifically icy dust grains (e.g., particles adsorption and
desorption). Gas-grain and grain-gas transitions as well as formation and
sublimation of interstellar ices are thus essential elements of understanding
astrophysical observations of cold environments (e.g., pre-stellar cores) where
unexpected amounts of a large variety of chemical species have been observed in
the gas phase. Adsorbed atoms and molecules also undergo chemical reactions
which are not efficient in the gas phase. Therefore, the parameterization of
the physical properties of atoms and molecules interacting with dust grain
particles is clearly a key aspect to interpret astronomical observations and to
build realistic and predictive astrochemical models. In this consensus
evaluation, we focus on parameters controlling the thermal desorption of ices
and how these determine pathways towards molecular complexity and define the
location of snowlines, which ultimately influence the planet formation process.
We review different crucial aspects of desorption parameters both from a
theoretical and experimental point of view. We critically assess the desorption
parameters commonly used in the astrochemical community for astrophysical
relevant species and provide tables with recommended values. In addition, we
show that a non-trivial determination of the pre-exponential factor nu using
the Transition State Theory can affect the binding energy value. Finally, we
conclude this work by discussing the limitations of theoretical and
experimental approaches currently used to determine the desorption properties

conventional attacks only target supervised classifiers given their predicted

classifiers. To better leverage the rich representation of encoders, we further
propose Cont-Steal, a contrastive-learning-based attack, and validate its
improved stealing effectiveness in various experiment settings. As a takeaway,
we appeal to our community's attention to the intellectual property protection

singular redefinition of the dimensionless coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term,
has been very extensively discussed in the cosmological context. The term is
added as a quadratic contribution of the curvature tensor to the
Einstein-Hilbert action, originating theories of ""Einstein Gauss-Bonnet"" (EGB)
type. We point out that the action obtained by the dimensional regularization
procedure, implemented with the extraction of a single conformal factor,
correspond just to an ordinary Wess-Zumino anomaly action, even though it is
deprived of the contribution from the Weyl tensor. We also show that a purely
gravitational version of the EGB theory can be generated by allowing a finite
renormalization of the Gauss-Bonnet topological contribution at $d= 4 +
\epsilon$, as pointed out by Mazur and Mottola. The result is an effective
action which is quadratic, rather then quartic, in the dilaton field, and scale
free, compared to the previous derivations. The dilaton, in this case can be
removed from the spectrum, leaving a pure gravitational theory, which is
nonlocal. We comment on the physical meaning of the two types of actions, which
may be used to describe such topological terms both below and above the
conformal breaking scale.

boundary-layer flow surrounding fire whirls developing over localized fuel
sources lying on a horizontal surface. The inviscid swirling motion found
outside the boundary layer, driven by the entrainment of the buoyant turbulent
plume of hot combustion products that develops above the fire, is described by
an irrotational solution, obtained by combining Taylor's self-similar solution
for the motion in the axial plane with the azimuthal motion induced by a line
vortex of circulation $2 \pi \Gamma$. The development of the boundary layer
from a prescribed radial location is determined by numerical integration for
different swirl levels, measured by the value of the radial-to-azimuthal
velocity ratio $\sigma$ at the initial radial location. As in the case
$\sigma=0$, treated in the seminal boundary-layer analysis of Burggraf et al.
(Phys. Fluids, 1971), the pressure gradient associated with the centripetal
acceleration of the inviscid flow is seen to generate a pronounced radial
inflow. Specific attention is given to the terminal shape of the boundary-layer
velocity near the axis, which displays a three-layered structure that is
described by matched asymptotic expansions. The resulting composite expansion,
dependent on the level of ambient swirl through the parameter $\sigma$, is
employed as boundary condition to describe the deflection of the boundary-layer
flow near the axis to form a vertical swirl jet. Numerical solutions of the
resulting non-slender collision region for different values of $\sigma$ are
presented both for inviscid flow and for viscous flow with moderately large
values of the controlling Reynolds number $\Gamma/\nu$. The velocity
description provided is useful in mathematical formulations of localized
fire-whirl flows, providing consistent boundary conditions accounting for the
ambient swirl level.

GBs easily form vacancies with deep defect electronic states and are also
preferential segregation sites for various impurity species, such as C, N, and

the selection contains at least one edge from each minimal conflicting

\textit{the critical subgraph} of a snark and the set of minimal conflicting

conflicting in some minimal colouring of the snark. Further to this, we define
groups, or \textit{clusters}, of minimal conflicting subgraphs. We then
highlight some interesting properties and problems relating to clusters of

generated by an internal dynamo mechanism. In the Sun, the dynamo mechanism
produces a balance between the amounts of magnetic flux generated and lost over
the Sun's 11-year activity cycle and it is visible in the Sun's different
atmospheric layers using multi-wavelength observations. We used the same
observational diagnostics, spanning several decades, to probe the emergence of
magnetic flux on the two close by, active- and low-mass K dwarfs: 61 Cygni A
and Epsilon Eridani. Our results show that 61 Cygni A follows the Solar dynamo
with a regular cycle at all wavelengths, while Epsilon Eridani represents a
more extreme level of the Solar dynamo, while also showing strong Solar-like
characteristics. For the first time we show magnetic butterfly diagrams for
stars other than the Sun. For the two K stars and the Sun, the rate at which
the toroidal field is generated from surface poloidal field is similar to the
rate at which toroidal flux is lost through flux emergence. This suggests that
the surface field plays a crucial role in the dynamos of all three stars.
Finally, for Epsilon Eridani, we show that the two chromospheric cycle periods,
of ~3 and ~13 years, correspond to two superimposed magnetic cycles.

survey. We detected SiO emission in 128 (87.7$\%$) sources and identified 171
SiO clumps, 105 of which are spatially separated from 3 mm continuum emission.
A large amount of the SiO line profiles (60$\%$) are non-Gaussian. The velocity
dispersion of the SiO lines ranges from 0.3 to 5.43 km s$^{-1}$. In 63 sources
the SiO clumps are associated with H$_\rm{II}$ regions characterized by
H40$\alpha$ emission. We find that 68$\%$ (116) of the SiO clumps are
associated with strong outflows. The median velocity dispersion of the SiO line
for outflow sources and non-outflow sources is 1.91 km s$^{-1}$ and 0.99 km
s$^{-1}$, respectively. These results indicate that outflow activities could be
connected to strongly shocked gas. The velocity dispersion and
[SiO]/[H$^{13}$CO$^+$] intensity ratio do not show any correlation with the
dust temperature and particle number density of clumps. We find a positive
correlation between the SiO line luminosity and the bolometric luminosity,
implying stronger shock activities are associated with more luminous
proto-clusters. The SiO clumps in associations with H$_\rm{II}$ regions were
found to show a steeper feature in $L_\rm{sio}$/$L_\rm{bol}$. The SiO line
luminosity and the fraction of shocked gas have no apparent evidence of
correlation with the evolutionary stages traced by luminosity to mass ratio

operator the s-wave pion condensation in the isospin-symmetric matter does not

ways alternative sources framed COVID-19 vaccines. More differences were found

associations with side effects than ""AstraZeneca"". With the temporary
suspension of the latter, on March 15th 2021, we identified a

as semantically richer in negative associations with side effects, while
""Pfizer"" underwent a positive shift in valence, mostly related to its higher
efficacy. ""Thrombosis"" entered the frame of vaccines together with fearful
conceptual associations, while ""death"" underwent an emotional shift, steering
towards fear in alternative titles and losing its hopeful connotation in

projects based on the votes of members of the community. Different rules have
been used to aggregate participants' votes. Past research has studied the
trade-off between notions of social welfare and fairness in the multi-winner
setting (a special case of participatory budgeting with identical project
costs) by Lackner and Skowron (2020). But there is little understanding of this
trade-off in the more general PB setting. This paper provides a theoretical and
empirical study of the worst-case guarantees of several common rules to better
understand the trade-off between social welfare, representation. We show that
many of the guarantees from the multi-winner setting do not generalize to the
PB setting, and that the introduction of costs leads to substantially worse
guarantees, thereby exacerbating the welfare-representation trade-off. We
extend our theoretical analysis to studying how the requirement of
proportionality over voting rules affects this trade-off. We further study how
the requirement of proportionality over voting rules effects the guarantees on
social welfare and representation. We study the latter point also empirically,
both on real and synthetic datasets. We show that variants of the recently

i) increase in verbosity; ii) increased use of functional words; and iii)
sentiment shifts as measured by different sentiment analysis tools. Combined,
these results suggest that social media engagement, as well as its sentiment,

such approaches from 2D fan-beam to 3D cone-beam data is challenging due to the
prohibitively high GPU memory that would be needed to train such models. This
paper proposes to use neural ordinary differential equations to solve the
reconstruction problem in a residual formulation via numerical integration. For
training, there is no need to backpropagate through several unrolled network
blocks nor through the internals of the solver. Instead, the gradients are
obtained very memory-efficiently in the neural ODE setting allowing for
training on a single consumer graphics card. The method is able to reduce the
root mean squared error by over 30% compared to the best performing classical
iterative reconstruction algorithm and produces high quality cone-beam
reconstructions even in a sparse view scenario.

exhibitions of non-trivial bulk topology on lower-dimensional boundaries like

plethora of systems by tuning staggered tunneling strength or manipulating
existing topological phases, here we show that a higher-order topological phase
can be driven solely by mirror-symmetric onsite potentials. We first introduce
a simple chain model in one dimension that mimics the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like
model. However, due to the lack of internal symmetries like chiral or
particle-hole symmetry, the energies of the topological edge modes are not
pinned at zero. Once the model is generalized to two dimensions, we observe the
emergence of topological corner modes. These corner modes are intrinsic
manifestation of non-trivial bulk band topology protected by mirror symmetry,
and thus, they are robust against symmetry-preserved perturbations. Our study
provides a concise proposal for realizing a class of higher-order topological
insulators, which involves only tuning onsite energies. This can be easily
accessible in experiments and provides a different playground for engineering

developed from the (reduced) density matrix or its Wigner-Weyl transformation,
the modelling of collisions may violate complete positivity (precluding the
typical probabilistic interpretation). In this paper, we show that such quantum
transport models can also strongly violate the energy conservation in the

models to exact results for an electron interacting with a photon, we conclude
that there is no fundamental restriction that prevents a collision model
developed within the (reduced) density matrix or Wigner formalisms to satisfy
simultaneously complete positivity and energy conservation. However, at the
practical level, the development of such satisfactory collision model seems
very complicated. Collision models with an explicit knowledge of the

allow to model collisions of each electron individually in a controlled way

especially in product packaging. However, the anti-counterfeiting QR code has
the risk of being copied and forged in the circulation process. In reality,
copying is usually based on genuine anti-counterfeiting QR codes, but the
brands and models of copiers are diverse, and it is extremely difficult to
determine which individual copier the forged anti-counterfeiting code come
from. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a method for copy
forgery identification of anti-counterfeiting QR code based on deep learning.
We first analyze the production principle of anti-counterfeiting QR code, and
convert the identification of copy forgery to device category forensics, and
then a Dual-Branch Multi-Scale Feature Fusion network is proposed. During the
design of the network, we conducted a detailed analysis of the data
preprocessing layer, single-branch design, etc., combined with experiments, the
specific structure of the dual-branch multi-scale feature fusion network is
determined. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved
a high accuracy of copy forgery identification, which exceeds the current
series of methods in the field of image forensics.

biomedical samples and has a high potential for use in clinical applications,
it is not common in clinical routines. One of the factors that obstruct the
integration of Raman spectroscopic tools into clinical routines is the
complexity of the data processing workflow. Software tools that simplify
spectroscopic data handling may facilitate such integration by familiarizing
clinical experts with the advantages of Raman spectroscopy.
  Here, RAMANMETRIX is introduced as a user-friendly software with an intuitive
web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that incorporates a complete workflow
for chemometric analysis of Raman spectra, from raw data pretreatment to a
robust validation of machine learning models. The software can be used both for
model training and for the application of the pretrained models onto new data
sets. Users have full control of the parameters during model training, but the
testing data flow is frozen and does not require additional user input.
RAMANMETRIX is available in two versions: as standalone software and web
application. Due to the modern software architecture, the computational backend
part can be executed separately from the GUI and accessed through an
application programming interface (API) for applying a preconstructed model to
the measured data. This opens up possibilities for using the software as a data
processing backend for the measurement devices in real-time.
  The models preconstructed by more experienced users can be exported and
reused for easy one-click data preprocessing and prediction, which requires
minimal interaction between the user and the software. The results of such
prediction and graphical outputs of the different data processing steps can be
exported and saved.

a warm dark matter (WDM) universe, where dark matter density parameter
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and WDM mass $m_\mathrm{WDM}$ strongly influence both CD

present a new, albeit simple, 3D convolutional neural network for efficient

high-fidelity parameter recovery for CD and EoR astrophysics ($R^2>0.78-0.99$),
together with DM density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ ($R^2>0.97$) and WDM mass
($R^2>0.61$, significantly better for $m_\mathrm{WDM}<3-4\,$keV). For realistic

parameter recovery is unaffected, while for moderate, less optimistic
foreground levels (occupying the so-called wedge) the recovery of the WDM mass
deteriorates, while other parameters remain robust against increased foreground
levels at $R^2>0.9$. We further test the robustness of our network-based
inference against modelling uncertainties and systematics by transfer learning
between bare simulations and mock observations; we find robust recovery of
specific X-ray luminosity and ionising efficiency, while DM density and WDM

gravitational model with a central bulge, bar, disc, and dark matter halo (or
simply dark halo) has been set up and analyzed from the viewpoint of escape in
open Hamiltonian systems for this purpose. Additionally, this model has been
examined separately for the dark halo profiles: oblate and NFW. In both
circumstances, an escape mechanism has been identified near the saddle points
of the phase space, which correspond to the bar ends. The escaping motion of
stars is seen using orbital maps and Poincar\'e surface section maps generated
in various phase planes. Finally, the relationship between chaos and dark halo
parameters such as mass, size, circular velocity, and nature has been studied.
Our findings suggest that oblate dark halos are preferred over NFW dark halos
for justifying the formation of full-fledged spiral arms and extended
distribution of dark halos in giant spiral galaxies with supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) at their centers. Again, the oblate dark halos well justify the
emergence of less prominent or poor spiral arms and the core-dominated
distribution of dark halos in dwarf and LSB galaxies in the absence of central
SMBHs. On the other hand, extreme central baryonic feedback is required for the
NFW halos to generate spiral patterns, and such dark halos should be preferred
for galaxies with extremely energetic centers.

take rapid decisions, a detailed understanding of the current situation is
necessary. Estimates of time-varying, instantaneous reproduction numbers
represent a way to quantify the viral transmission in real time. They are often
defined through a mathematical compartmental model of the epidemic, like a
stochastic SEIR model, whose parameters must be estimated from multiple time
series of epidemiological data. Because of very high dimensional parameter

means of the Malliavin calculus and fine estimates of several multiple singular
integrals. Consequently, these two methods are proved to be strongly convergent
with order nearly $\min\{2(H+\alpha-1), \alpha\}$, where $H \in (1/2,1)$ and
$\alpha\in(1-H,1)$ respectively characterize the singularity levels of
fractional noises and singular kernels in the underlying equation. This result
improves the existing convergence order $H+\alpha-1$ of Euler methods for the
nonlinear case, and gives a positive answer to the open problem raised in [4].
As an application of the theoretical findings, we further investigate the
complexity of the multilevel Monte Carlo simulation based on the fast Euler
method, which turns out to behave better performance than the standard Monte
Carlo simulation when computing the expectation of functionals of the

goal of device fingerprinting is to accurately and uniquely identify a device,
which requires the generated fingerprints to have good stability. However, the
fingerprints generated by existing fingerprinting technologies are not stable
enough or change frequently, making it impossible to track the target device
for a long time. In this paper, we propose a novel DRAM-based fingerprinting
technique. The device fingerprint generated by our technique has high stability
and can be used to track the device for a long time. We leverage the Rowhammer
technique to repeatedly and quickly access a row in DRAM to get bit flips. We
then construct a physical fingerprint of the device based on the locations of
the collected bit flips. The evaluation results of the uniqueness and
reliability of the physical fingerprint show that it can be used to distinguish

results of device identification in laboratory settings show that our proposed
technique can accurately identify the target device by establishing a

lack of in-depth mining of comprehensive historical trajectory data. This paper
proposes an Automatic Identification System (AIS) data-driven long short-term

forward sub-network in our method combines LSTM and attention mechanism to mine

of our proposed method in predicting short-term and mid-term trajectories has
increased by 96.8% and 86.5% on average compared with the BiLSTM and Seq2seq.

nuclei can be sufficient to explain the Galactic CRs. The ion temperature
becomes significantly lower than in the case of no CRs. To distinguish the case

to our approach is a novel solver that iteratively solves for per-view depth
map and normal map by optimizing an energy potential based on the locally
planar assumption. Specifically, the algorithm updates depth map by propagating
from neighboring pixels with slanted planes, and updates normal map with local
probabilistic plane fitting. Both two steps are monitored by a customized
confidence map. This solver is not only effective as a post-processing tool for
plane-based depth refinement and completion, but also differentiable such that
it can be efficiently integrated into deep learning pipelines. Our multi-view
stereo system employs multiple optimization steps of the solver over the
initial prediction of depths and surface normals. The whole system can be
trained end-to-end, decoupling the challenging problem of matching pixels
within poorly textured regions from the cost-volume based neural network.
Experimental results on ScanNet and RGB-D Scenes V2 demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of the proposed deep MVS system on multi-view

describes the possibility of reconstructing the state that characterizes the

study this property and to introduce analytical criteria able to check whether
a dynamic system satisfies this property or not, there is no general analytical
criterion to automatically check the state observability when the dynamics are
also driven by unknown inputs. Here, we introduce the general analytical
solution of this fundamental problem, often called the unknown input
observability problem. This paper provides the general analytical solution of
this problem, namely, it provides the systematic procedure, based on automatic
computation (differentiation and matrix rank determination), that allows us to
automatically check the state observability even in the presence of unknown
inputs (Algorithm 6.1). A first solution of this problem was presented in the
second part of the book: ""Observability: A New Theory Based on the Group of
Invariance"" [45]. The solution presented by this paper completes the previous
solution in [45]. In particular, the new solution exhaustively accounts for the
systems that do not belong to the category of the systems that are ""canonic
with respect to their unknown inputs"". The analytical derivations largely
exploit several new concepts and analytical results introduced in [45].
Finally, as a simple consequence of the results here obtained, we also provide
the answer to the problem of unknown input reconstruction which is intimately
related to the problem of state observability. We illustrate the implementation
of the new algorithm by studying the observability properties of a nonlinear
system in the framework of visual-inertial sensor fusion, whose dynamics are
driven by two unknown inputs and one known input.

Recently, there has been a lot of focus on using remote sensing data for this

to the high rotational speeds observed for some objects. Similar to the case of
brown dwarfs, the thermal emission from these planets should be polarized by
scatterings of molecules and condensate cloud particles, and the
rotation-induced asymmetry of the planet's disk would yield to net non-zero
detectable polarization. Considering an anisotropic atmosphere, we present here
a three-dimensional approach to estimate the disk-averaged polarization that
arises due to the oblateness of the planets. We solve the multiple-scattering
vector radiative transfer equations at each location on the planet's disk and
calculate the local Stokes vectors and then calculate the disk-integrated flux
and linear polarization. For a cloud-free atmosphere, the polarization signal
is observable only in the visible wavelength region. However, the presence of
clouds in the planetary atmospheres leads to a detectable amount of
polarization in the infrared wavelength region where the planetary thermal
emission peaks. Considering different broad-band filters of the SPHERE-IRDIS
instrument of the Very Large Telescope, we present generic models for the
polarization at different wavelength bands as a function of their rotation
period. We also present polarization models for the Exoplanets $\beta$ Pic b

Our insights on the polarization of young giant planets presented here would be

locations, the SP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service
functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease an appropriate amount
of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types.
Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending
on specific access technology supported across sites and IoT data collection
patterns.
  We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce
the cost of SPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by
shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive
locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT
service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision
process, where the SP determines the pricing of each location and devices
schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy.
Simulations show that the SP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the
trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data.

out that only the knowledge of the density dependence of the quasi-particle

gap function, are enough to obtain an explicit and accurate local functional of
the densities without any adjustment a posteriori. This opens the way toward an
Effective Field Theory formulation of the Density Functional Theory in the
sense that we obtain a universal expansion of the functional parameters
entering in the theory as a series in pairing gap function. Finally, we discuss
possible applications of the developed approach allowing precise analysis of

navigation is rare. Here, using 225 million subway trips from three major
cities in China, we quantify navigation difficulty from an information
perspective. Our results reveal that 1) people conserve a small number of
repeatedly used routes, and 2) the navigation information in the subnetworks
formed by those routes is much smaller than the theoretical value in the global
network, suggesting that the decision cost for actual trips is significantly
smaller than the theoretical upper limit found in previous studies. By modeling
routing behaviors in growing networks, we show that while the global network
becomes difficult to navigate, navigability can be improved in subnetworks. We
further present a universal linear relationship between the empirical and
theoretical search information, which allows the two metrics to predict each
other. Our findings demonstrate how large-scale observations can quantify
real-world navigation behaviors and aid in evaluating transportation planning.

applied to reduce the latency and storage cost of CNNs. Among the quantization
methods, Binary and Ternary Weight Networks (BWNs and TWNs) have a unique
advantage over 8-bit and 4-bit quantization. They replace the multiplication
operations in CNNs with additions, which are favoured on In-Memory-Computing
(IMC) devices. IMC acceleration for BWNs has been widely studied. However,
though TWNs have higher accuracy and better sparsity than BWNs, IMC
acceleration for TWNs has limited research. TWNs on existing IMC devices are
inefficient because the sparsity is not well utilized, and the addition
operation is not efficient.
  In this paper, we propose FAT as a novel IMC accelerator for TWNs. First, we
propose a Sparse Addition Control Unit, which utilizes the sparsity of TWNs to
skip the null operations on zero weights. Second, we propose a fast addition
scheme based on the memory Sense Amplifier to avoid the time overhead of both
carry propagation and writing back the carry to memory cells. Third, we further
propose a Combined-Stationary data mapping to reduce the data movement of
activations and weights and increase the parallelism across memory columns.
Simulation results show that for addition operations at the Sense Amplifier
level, FAT achieves 2.00X speedup, 1.22X power efficiency, and 1.22X area
efficiency compared with a State-Of-The-Art IMC accelerator ParaPIM. FAT
achieves 10.02X speedup and 12.19X energy efficiency compared with ParaPIM on
networks with 80% average sparsity.

both fine spatial resolution and high quantum efficiency at relatively high
X-ray energies (>5keV). A silicon imaging detector meeting these requirements
will have a ratio of detector thickness to pixel size of six or more, roughly
twice that of legacy imaging sensors. This implies greater diffusion of X-ray
charge packets. We investigate consequences for sensor performance, reporting
charge diffusion measurements in a fully-depleted, 50um thick, back-illuminated
CCD with 8um pixels. We are able to measure the size distributions of charge
packets produced by 5.9 keV and 1.25 keV X-rays in this device. We find that
individual charge packets exhibit a gaussian spatial distribution, and
determine the frequency distribution of event widths for a range of internal
electric field strength levels. We find a standard deviation for the largest
charge packets, which occur near the entrance window, of 3.9um. We show that
the shape of the event width distribution provides a clear indicator of full
depletion and infer the relationship between event width and interaction depth.
We compare measured width distributions to simulations. We compare traditional,
'sum-above-threshold' algorithms for event amplitude determination to 2D
gaussian fitting of events and find better spectroscopic performance with the
former for 5.9 keV events and comparable results at 1.25 keV. The reasons for
this difference are discussed. We point out the importance of read noise driven
detection thresholds in spectral resolution, and note that the derived read
noise requirements for mission concepts such as AXIS and Lynx may be too lax to
meet spectral resolution requirements. While we report measurements made with a
CCD, we note that they have implications for the performance of high
aspect-ratio silicon active pixel sensors as well.

directly impacted by the quantity of image data available. This is due to deep
learning models requiring large image datasets to provide high-level
performance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely utilized
to address data limitations through the generation of synthetic biomedical
images. GANs consist of two models. The generator, a model that learns how to
produce synthetic images based on the feedback it receives. The discriminator,
a model that classifies an image as synthetic or real and provides feedback to
the generator. Throughout the training process, a GAN can experience several
technical challenges that impede the generation of suitable synthetic imagery.
First, the mode collapse problem whereby the generator either produces an
identical image or produces a uniform image from distinct input features.
Second, the non-convergence problem whereby the gradient descent optimizer
fails to reach a Nash equilibrium. Thirdly, the vanishing gradient problem
whereby unstable training behavior occurs due to the discriminator achieving
optimal classification performance resulting in no meaningful feedback being
provided to the generator. These problems result in the production of synthetic
imagery that is blurry, unrealistic, and less diverse. To date, there has been
no survey article outlining the impact of these technical challenges in the
context of the biomedical imagery domain. This work presents a review and
taxonomy based on solutions to the training problems of GANs in the biomedical
imaging domain. This survey highlights important challenges and outlines future
research directions about the training of GANs in the domain of biomedical
imagery.

eliminated if an abrupt physics transition changed the Cepheid parameters in
the near past of the Universe, nearly $70-150\,$Myrs ago. In this letter we
stress the possibility that this abrupt transition was caused by the smooth
passage of our Universe through a pressure finite-time cosmological
singularity. Being a non-crushing type singularity the pressure singularity can
leave its imprints in the Universe, since it occurs globally and literally
everywhere. We discuss how this scenario could easily be realized by $F(R)$
gravity, with the strong energy conditions being satisfied without the need for
a scalar field or specific matter fluids. We also stress the fact that the
pressure singularity can affect the effective gravitational constant of $F(R)$
gravity. Moreover, we stress the fact that pressure singularities can disrupt
the trajectories of bound objects in the Universe, which is also pointed out in
the literature, even in the context of general relativity. We also show
numerically in a general relativistic framework that elliptic trajectories are
distorted and changed to different elliptic trajectories when the Universe
passes through the pressure singularity. Such a disruption of the trajectories
could have tidal effects on the surface of the earth, for example on sea waters
and oceans, regarding the distortion of moon's elliptic trajectory.
Accordingly, the distortion of earth's trajectory around the sun could have
affected climatologically earth $70-150\,$Myrs ago.

adaptively using $Z$ measurements or measurements of $\cos(\theta)X +

is modified, and show that for lattices of finite degree $D$, there is a

the case of the square lattice of qubits, the size of the classically

limitations implement that the SM must be expanded to explain the observables
which can not be addressed by the SM such as mass of neutrinos, a few of
anomalies, DM, DE, etc. In order to extend the SM, we take the model-dependent
approach and a minimal extension to the SM. For the minimal extension, we make
use of vector-like family, SM-like scalar (plus a singlet flavon), and
$U(1)^\prime$ symmetry. A first BSM model in my first work is to explain both
the electron and muon anomalous magnetic moments at the same time, while
keeping the constraints $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ decay and neutrino trident
production. Especially, two mass sources, chirality flip and vector-like mass,
appear in our analytic prediction for the anomalies and the chirality flip mass
between $0$ and $200 \operatorname{GeV}$ is searched and then we show no any
value between them can satisfy the anomalies at the same time. A second BSM
model in my second work shares the same motivation, to explain both anomalies,
however it goes one step further by considering the strong hierarchical
structure of the SM into the second BSM model. In this BSM model, the SM
appears as an effective theory spontaneously broken from the $U(1)^\prime$
symmetry. Both anomalies are studied in the neutrino sector first and it
reveals that the neutrino contributions are too small to explain their
experimental bounds, so leading to a conclusion that the neutrinos can not
explain both anomalies simultaneously. Next we study the scalar contribution
and show that the scalar contributions can explain both anomalies
simultaneously. My third work investigate the diverse FCNCs within the same
second BSM model to constrain mass range of vector-like fermions.

number, variance and rescaled density of real eigenvalues in this critical

model considering preemptive repeat priority policy with phase-type (PH)
distributed retrial times. For the sake of comprehension, the scenario of model
operation prior and later to the occurrence of the disaster is referred to as
the normal scenario and as the catastrophic scenario, respectively. In both
scenarios, the arrival and service processes of all types of calls follow
marked Markovian arrival process (MMAP) and PH distribution with distinct
parameters, respectively. In the normal scenario, the incoming heterogeneous
calls are categorized as handoff calls and new calls. An arriving new call will
be blocked when all the channels are occupied, and consequently, will join the
orbit (virtual space) of infinite capacity. From the orbit, the blocked new
call can either retry for the service or exit the system following PH
distribution. Whereas, an arriving handoff call is given preemptive repeat
priority over a new call in service when all the channels are occupied and at
least one of the channel is occupied with a new call otherwise the handoff call
is dropped, and consequently, this preempted new call will join the orbit. In
the catastrophic scenario, when a disaster causes the shut down of the entire
system and failure of all functioning channels, a set of backup channels is
quickly deployed to restore services. The Markov chain's ergodicity criteria
are established by demonstrating that it belongs to the class of asymptotically
quasi-Toeplitz Markov chains (AQTMC). For the approximate computation of the
stationary distribution, a new approach is developed.
  An optimization problem to obtain optimal value of total number of backup
channels has been formulated and dealt by employing non dominated sorting

properties requires quantitative microstructure-resolved observation of the
nanoscale deformation mechanisms at, e.g., multiphase interfaces. This calls
for a combinatory approach beyond advanced testing methods such as microscale
strain mapping on bulk material and micrometer sized deformation tests of
single grains. We propose a nanomechanical testing framework that has been
carefully designed to integrate several state-of-the-art testing and
characterization methods: (i) well-defined nano-tensile testing of carefully
selected and isolated multiphase specimens, (ii) front&rear-sided SEM-EBSD
microstructural characterization combined with front&rear-sided in-situ SEM-DIC
testing at very high resolution enabled by a recently developed InSn nano-DIC
speckle pattern, (iii) optimized DIC strain mapping aided by application of SEM
scanning artefact correction and DIC deconvolution for improved spatial
resolution, (iv) a novel microstructure-to-strain alignment framework to
deliver front&rear-sided, nanoscale, microstructure-resolved strain fields, and
(v) direct comparison of microstructure, strain and SEM-BSE damage maps in the
deformed configuration. Demonstration on a micrometer-sized dual-phase steel
specimen, containing an incompatible ferrite-martensite interface, shows how
the nanoscale deformation mechanisms can be unraveled. Discrete
lath-boundary-aligned martensite strain localizations transit over the
interface into diffuse ferrite plasticity, revealed by the nanoscale
front&rear-sided microstructure-to-strain alignment and optimization of DIC
correlations. The proposed framework yields front&rear-sided aligned
microstructure and strain fields providing 3D interpretation of the deformation
and opening new opportunities for unprecedented validation of advanced
multiphase simulations.

alternative mechanism to synthesize carbon nanomaterials inexpensively at high
yield. Until recently, CO$_2$ was thought to be unreactive, making its removal
a challenge. CO$_2$ is the main cause of anthropogenic global warming and its
utilization and transformation into a stable, valuable material provides an
incentivized pathway to mitigate climate change. This study focuses on
controlled electrochemical conditions in molten lithium carbonate to split
CO$_2$ absorbed from the atmosphere into into carbon nanotubes, and into
various macroscopic assemblies of CNTs,, which may be useful for
nano-filtration. Different CNTs, morphologies were prepared electrochemically
by variation of the anode and cathode composition and architecture, electrolyte
composition pre-electrolysis processing, and the variation of current
application and current density. Individual CNT morphologies structures and the
CNT molten carbonate growth mechanism are explored by SEM, TEM, HAADF EDX, XRD
and Raman. The principle commercial technology for CNT production had been
chemical vapor deposition, which is an order of magnitude more expensive,
generally requires metallo-organics, rather than CO$_2$ as reactants, and can
be highly energy and CO$_2$ emission intensive (carries a high carbon positive,
rather than negative, footprint).

Conventionally, IoT/edge devices need to transmit the data directly to the base
station for training the model using machine learning techniques. The data
transmission introduces privacy issues that might lead to security concerns and
monetary losses. Recently, Federated learning was proposed to partially solve
privacy issues via model-sharing with base station. However, the centralized
nature of federated learning only allow the devices within the vicinity of base
stations to share the trained models. Furthermore, the long-range communication
compels the devices to increase transmission power, which raises the energy
efficiency concerns. In this work, we propose distributed federated learning
(DBFL) framework that overcomes the connectivity and energy efficiency issues
for distant devices. The DBFL framework is compatible with mobile edge
computing architecture that connects the devices in a distributed manner using
clustering protocols. Experimental results show that the framework increases
the classification performance by 7.4\% in comparison to conventional federated
learning while reducing the energy consumption.

covariates is of particular interest in practice. When the covariates are of
moderate to high-dimension and the effects are not sparse, several approaches
have been proposed for estimation and inference. One major problem with the
existing approaches is that the inference procedures are not robust to the
normality assumption on the covariates and the residual errors. In this paper,
we propose an estimating equation approach to the estimation and inference on
the explained variation in the high-dimensional linear model. Unlike the
existing approaches, the proposed approach does not rely on the restrictive
normality assumptions for inference. It is shown that the proposed estimator is
consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under reasonable conditions.
Simulation studies demonstrate better performance of the proposed inference
procedure in comparison with the existing approaches. The proposed approach is
applied to studying the variation of glycohemoglobin explained by environmental

The main novelties of this work are: (1) We have shown that the cohesive stress

as the nonlocal peridynamic stress; (2) For the first time, we have applied an
irreversible built-in cohesive stress-strain relation in a bond-based cohesive

phenomenological plasticity stress-strain relations; (3) The cohesive bond
force possesses both axial and tangential components, and they contribute a
nonlinear constitutive relation with variable Poisson's ratios; (4) The
bond-based cohesive constitutive model is consistent with the cohesive fracture
criterion, and (5) We have shown that the proposed method is able to model
inelastic fracture and simulate ductile fracture of small scale yielding in the

learning, known as Deep Transfer Learning (DTL), attempts to reduce such
dependency and costs by reusing an obtained knowledge from a source data/task

network/model-based approaches. These methods reduce the dependency of deep
learning models on extensive training data and drastically decrease training
costs. As a result, researchers detected Covid-19 infection on chest X-Rays
with high accuracy at the beginning of the pandemic with minimal data using DTL

different scenarios. In this paper, we review the definition and taxonomy of
deep transfer learning and well-known methods. Then we investigate the DTL

Gaussian random field with a generic covariance function. Our derivations
further demonstrate the asymptotic statistical decoupling of the Bayesian

  The replica solution depicts that strictly nonlinear models establish an

optimal Bayesian inference changes from perfect to an uncorrelated learning.
Based on this finding, we design a new secure coding scheme which achieves the
secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel. This interesting result implies that
strictly nonlinear generative models are perfectly secured without any secure

colouring, the travelling salesman, and the modular N-queens problem. We show
that such a formulation allows for several orders of magnitude improvement in
the search for the global minimum compared to the standard Ising formulation.
At the same time, the amplitude dynamics escape from the local minima.

his 95 birthday. In the ideal disorder-free situation, a two-dimensional band
gap insulator has an activation energy for conductivity equal to half the band
gap, $\Delta$. But transport experiments usually exhibit a much smaller
activation energy at low temperature, and the relation between this activation
energy and $\Delta$ is unclear. Here we consider the temperature-dependent
conductivity of a two-dimensional narrow gap semiconductor on a substrate
containing Coulomb impurities, mostly focusing on the case when amplitude of
the random potential $\Gamma \gg \Delta$. We show that the conductivity
generically exhibits three regimes and only the highest temperature regime
exhibits an activation energy that reflects the band gap. At lower
temperatures, the conduction proceeds through nearest-neighbor or
variable-range hopping between electron and hole puddles created by the
disorder. We show that the activation energy and characteristic temperature
associated with these processes steeply collapse near a critical impurity
concentration. Larger concentrations lead to an exponentially small activation
energy and exponentially long localization length, which in mesoscopic samples
can appear as a disorder-induced insulator-to-metal transition. We arrive at a
similar disorder driven steep insulator-metal transition in thin films of
three-dimensional topological insulators with very large dielectric constant,
where due to confinement of electric field internal Coulomb impurities create
larger disorder potential. Away from neutrality point this unconventional
insulator-to-metal transition is augmented by conventional metal-insulator
transition at small impurity concentrations, so that we arrive at
disorder-driven re-entrant metal-insulator-metal transition.

the first of them employed in quantum electrodynamics, one calculates the

due to the field being proportional to the magnetic moment. It is also possible
to use the second method proceeding from the fact that the asymptotic form of
the vector potential at infinity is proportional to the magnetic moment. If the
electron were point-like, both the methods would yield identical results. In
the present paper is studied the magnetic field created by the electron in
hydrogen-like ions, which enables one to find the electron magnetic moment by
the second method. The electron magnetic moment in this case proves to be
different in different states of the electron in the Coulomb field of the ions

of Ultra Wide Band technology is evaluated. To achieve this, a prototype module
for the use with the Decawave transceiver DW1000 was implemented and added to
FruityMesh, an Internet of Things (IoT) mesh network of the company M-Way
Solutions. The focus of the network is low-power communication based on
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This includes, for example, Building Automation,
Lighting Management and Asset Tracking. Especially the last stated point
benefits from a position tracking as precise as possible and a long battery
life. Therefore, FruityMesh is used to perform a signal-strength based
localization with the existing BLE messages. Due to absorption, interference,
and diffraction, these measurements tend to fluctuate and allow a positioning
accuracy within 1.5m. With the integration of Ultra Wide Band and the Time of
Arrival (ToA) method, a centimeter-precise localization was made possible in
the course of this work, which at the same time causes only small additional
costs in general. Since the connection of extra hardware is associated with
decreased energy efficiency, an algorithm for optimizing the control was first
developed and then tested against the created scenarios. In addition to the
motion-based control of the hardware, various configurations and adjustments
were analyzed to reduce the power consumption by Ultra-Wideband (UWB)
transmission. Finally, the developed prototype was compared with a realistic
reproduction of the existing Asset Tracking to evaluate the benefits for the

vaccination rates have remained far below 100%. Not only that, but CDC data
shows that even in places where vaccine acceptance was proportionally high at
the outset of the Covid-19 vaccination effort, that willingness has not
necessarily translated into high rates of vaccination over the subsequent
months. We model how such a shift could have arisen, using parameters in
agreement with data from the state of Alabama. The simulations suggest that in
Alabama, local interactions would have favored the emergence of tight consensus
around the initial majority view, which was to accept the Covid-19 vaccine. Yet
this is not what happened. We therefore add to our model the impact of
mega-influencers such as mass media, the governor of the state, etc. Our
simulations show that a single vaccine-hesitant mega-influencer, reaching a
large fraction of the population, can indeed cause the consensus to shift
radically, from acceptance to hesitancy. Surprisingly this is true even when
the mega-influencer only reaches individuals who are already somewhat inclined
to agree with them, and under the conservative assumption that individuals give
no more weight to the mega-influencer than they would give to a single one of
their friends or neighbors. Our simulations also suggest that a competing
mega-influencer with the opposite view can shift the mean population opinion
back, but cannot restore the tightness of consensus around that view. Our code

  Principal","22 pages, 8 figures, including appendix",,,,"cs.MA cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Principal-Agent (PA) problems describe a broad class of economic
relationships characterized by misaligned incentives and asymmetric
information. The Principal's problem is to find optimal incentives given the
available information, e.g., a manager setting optimal wages for its employees.
Whereas the Principal is often assumed rational, comparatively little is known
about solutions when the Principal is boundedly rational, especially in the
sequential setting, with multiple Agents, and with multiple information
channels. Here, we develop RIRL, a deep reinforcement learning framework that
solves such complex PA problems with a rationally inattentive Principal. Such a
Principal incurs a cost for paying attention to information, which can model
forms of bounded rationality. We use RIRL to analyze rich economic phenomena in
manager-employee relationships. In the single-step setting, 1) RIRL yields
wages that are consistent with theoretical predictions; and 2) non-zero
attention costs lead to simpler but less profitable wage structures, and
increased Agent welfare. In a sequential setting with multiple Agents, RIRL
shows opposing consequences of the Principal's inattention to different
information channels: 1) inattention to Agents' outputs closes wage gaps based
on ability differences; and 2) inattention to Agents' efforts induces a social
dilemma dynamic in which Agents work harder, but essentially for free.
Moreover, RIRL reveals non-trivial relationships between the Principal's
inattention and Agent types, e.g., if Agents are prone to sub-optimal effort
choices, payment schedules are more sensitive to the Principal's attention
cost. As such, RIRL can reveal novel economic relationships and enables
progress towards understanding the effects of bounded rationality in dynamic
settings.

of developing techniques for analyzing and modeling brain networks. A
particularly powerful approach for studying complex neural systems is to
formulate generative models that use wiring rules to synthesize networks
closely resembling the topology of a given connectome. Successful models can
highlight the principles by which a network is organized (identify structural
features that arise from wiring rules versus those that emerge) and potentially
uncover the mechanisms by which it grows and develops. Previous research has
shown that such models can validate the effectiveness of spatial embedding and
other (non-spatial) wiring rules in shaping the network topology of the human
connectome. In this research, we propose variants of the action-based model
that combine a variety of generative factors capable of explaining the topology
of the human connectome. We test the descriptive validity of our models by
evaluating their ability to explain between-subject variability. Our analysis
provides evidence that geometric constraints are vital for connectivity between
brain regions, and an action-based model relying on both topological and
geometric properties can account for between-subject variability in structural
network properties. Further, we test correlations between parameters of
subject-optimized models and various measures of cognitive ability and find
that higher cognitive ability is associated with an individual's tendency to
form long-range or non-local connections.

known, yet there is no simple analytic model of how the noise and drift of a
gyroscope influence the fix displacement error (FDE) of an inertial navigation
system (INS). This work derives simple analytical expressions for the
cross-track and along-track errors of an aircraft whose INS consists solely of
a three-axis gyroscope system with perfect knowledge of the vertical direction.
The error signal of each gyroscope is Gaussian white noise and drift modeled as
a first-order Markov random walk. These expressions provide a straightforward
mean of calculating the FDE of an aircraft as a function of the flight
duration, velocity, noise amplitude, drift amplitude, and drift's time
constant. These expressions are validated with Monte-Carlo simulations of long
flights. This model quantifies the noise-versus-drift trade-off for a gyroscope
in an inertial navigation system. It can save time when estimating the noise
and drift that a gyroscope must exhibit to satisfy a given position-error
requirement, or vice versa. They are used in particular to confirm the values,
often cited without demonstration, of the noise and drift required to meet the
maximum position error of an aircraft imposed by the Federal Aviation
Administration's required navigation performance 10 specification. Finally, it
demonstrates that using the minimum in the measured Allan deviation of a
gyroscope as a metric of the drift is incorrect, because it fails to capture
the drift's time constant. The proper metric is the maximum in the Allan
deviation.

two to three years in higher education and four to five years in K to 12.
Applying AR technology in the education sector especially in STEM subjects, can
result in having a smart campus. In adopting a SMART Campus strategy, education
practitioners must address many intrinsic issues in science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) research. For example, in physics, there
are expensive or insufficient laboratory systems, system faults, and difficulty
simulating other experimental circumstances. In technology, many schools do not
have enough computers. In engineering, there are only a few instructors who are
knowledgeable in computer aided design (CAD). In mathematics, few teachers
incorporate technology into their lessons often because they believe it is
still better to teach through the traditional methods. Hence, In this paper we
discuss how AR is being used now in different learning areas in STEM to open
new doors to researchers and teachers as they transition their schools into
SMART campuses with the use of AR apps. Aligned with this, a suggested
framework for school administrators and policymakers is proposed based on a
