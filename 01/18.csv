classification rule with small expected 0-1 loss (error probability).
Conventional methods enable tractable learning and provide out-of-sample
generalization by using surrogate losses instead of the 0-1 loss and
considering specific families of rules (hypothesis classes). This paper
presents minimax risk classifiers (MRCs) that minize the worst-case 0-1 loss
with respect to uncertainty sets of distributions that can include the
underlying distribution, with a tunable confidence. We show that MRCs can
provide tight performance guarantees at learning and are strongly universally
consistent using feature mappings given by characteristic kernels. The paper
also proposes efficient optimization techniques for MRC learning and shows that
the methods presented can provide accurate classification together with tight
performance guarantees in practice.

particular, we evaluate the impact of inhomogeneities on gravitational wave
propagation by employing Buchert's framework of averaging. In context of a toy
model within the above framework, it is first shown how the redshift versus

the variation of the redshift dependent part of the observed gravitational wave
amplitude for different combination of our model parameters. We show that the
variation of the gravitational wave amplitude with respect to redshift can
deviate significantly compared to that in the $\Lambda$CDM-model. Our result
signifies the importance of local inhomogeneities on precision measurements of

quantum mechanics, metastable states, which last longer than expected, have
been observed. These metastable states are a consequence of the instability of
the bound state under the nonlinear Fermi's Golden Rule.
  In this study, we explore the underlying mathematical instability mechanism
from the bound state to these metastable states. Besides, we derive the sharp

importance in genomics applications. Unfortunately, even the simplest problem
of deciding if a string appears as a subpath of a graph admits a quadratic
lower bound under the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis (Equi et al. ICALP 2019,
SOFSEM 2021). To avoid this bottleneck, the research has shifted towards more
specific graph classes, e.g. those induced from multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs). Consider segmenting $\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..n]$ into $b$ blocks
$\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,1..j_1]$, $\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_1+1..j_2]$, $\ldots$,
$\mathsf{MSA}[1..m,j_{b-1}+1..n]$. The distinct strings in the rows of the
blocks, after the removal of gap symbols, form the nodes of an elastic founder
graph (EFG) where the edges represent the original connections observed in the
MSA. An EFG is called indexable if a node label occurs as a prefix of only
those paths that start from a node of the same block. Equi et al. (ISAAC 2021)
showed that such EFGs support fast pattern matching and gave an $O(mn \log
m)$-time algorithm for preprocessing the MSA in a way that allows the
construction of indexable EFGs maximizing the number of blocks and,
alternatively, minimizing the maximum length of a block, in $O(n)$ and $O(n
\log\log n)$ time respectively. Using the suffix tree and solving a novel
ancestor problem on trees, we improve the preprocessing to $O(mn)$ time and the
$O(n \log \log n)$-time EFG construction to $O(n)$ time, thus showing that both

3D object detection. Instead of establishing deterministic correspondence with
camera projection matrix, we model the mapping relationship between the image
and point clouds with a learnable alignment map. This map enables our model to
automate the alignment of non-homogenous features in a dynamic and data-driven
manner. Specifically, a cross-attention feature alignment module is devised to
adaptively aggregate \textit{pixel-level} image features for each voxel. To
enhance the semantic consistency during feature alignment, we also design a
self-supervised cross-modal feature interaction module, through which the model
can learn feature aggregation with \textit{instance-level} feature guidance.
Extensive experimental results show that our approach can lead to 2.3 mAP and
7.0 mAP improvements on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, respectively. Notably,
our best model reaches 70.9 NDS on the nuScenes testing leaderboard, achieving
competitive performance among various state-of-the-arts.

characterization on whether and how the energy dissipates in the RK
discretization, thereby leading to weak and strong stability criteria of RK

diagonal Pade approximations, based on an analytical Cholesky type
decomposition of a class of symmetric matrices. The structure of the matrices
is very complicated, rendering the discovery of the unified energy identity and
the proof of the decomposition highly challenging. Our proofs involve the

harmonisation strategies and evaluation metrics based on different theories. In
addition, a comprehensive checklist that summarises common practices for data
harmonisation studies is proposed to guide researchers to report their research
findings more effectively. Last but not least, flowcharts presenting possible
ways for methodology and metric selection are proposed and the limitations of
different methods have been surveyed for future research.

ridden with the ""curse of dimensionality"": the dimension of the Hilbert space
increases exponentially with the (square root of the) truncation level,
limiting its precision by the available memory resources. Here we describe an

presented here works with inputs describing the necessary CFT data in a
specified format. It makes possible much more precise calculations with given
computing resources and extends the reach of the method to problems requiring
large Hilbert space dimensions. In fact, it has already been used in a number
of recent works ranging from determination of form factors, through studying
confinement of topological excitations to non-equilibrium dynamics. Besides the

ubiquitous in sensor networks, error correction schemes based on Gottesman,
Kitaev and Preskill (GKP) states are required to enhance the performance, as
shown in [New J. Phys. 22, 022001 (2020)] assuming homogeneous noise among

enhancement to finite squeezed GKP states in a heterogeneous noise model. To
begin with, we study different concatenation schemes of GKP-two-mode-squeezing
codes. While traditional sequential concatenation schemes in previous works do
improve the suppression of noise, we propose a balanced concatenation scheme
that outperforms the sequential scheme in presence of finite GKP squeezing. We
then apply these results to two specific tasks in distributed quantum sensing

between imperfect squeezing and performance. For the former task, we consider
an energy-constrained scenario and provide an optimal way to distribute the
energy of the finite squeezed GKP states among the sensors. For the latter
task, we show that the error probability can still be drastically lowered via
concatenation of realistic finite squeezed GKP codes.

However, existing rule induction methods often result in long and consequently
less interpretable rule models. This problem can often be attributed to the
lack of appropriately expressive vocabulary, i.e., relevant predicates used as
literals in the decision model. Most existing rule induction algorithms presume
pre-defined literals, naturally decoupling the definition of the literals from
the rule learning phase. In contrast, we propose the Relational Rule Network
(R2N), a neural architecture that learns literals that represent a linear
relationship among numerical input features along with the rules that use them.
This approach opens the door to increasing the expressiveness of induced
decision models by coupling literal learning directly with rule learning in an
end-to-end differentiable fashion. On benchmark tasks, we show that these
learned literals are simple enough to retain interpretability, yet improve
prediction accuracy and provide sets of rules that are more concise compared to
state-of-the-art rule induction algorithms.

issue so-called fine-tuning problem. This motivates one to modify the spacetime
geometry of Einstein's GR. The $f(Q)$ gravity is a recently proposed modified
theory of gravity in which the non-metricity scalar $Q$ drives the
gravitational interaction. In this article, we consider a linear $f(Q)$ model,
specifically $f(Q)=\alpha Q + \beta$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are free
parameters. Then we estimate the best fit values of model parameters that would
be in agreement with the recent observational data sets. We use 57 points of
the updated $H(z)$ data sets, 6 points of the BAO data sets, and 1048 points
from the Pantheon supernovae samples. We apply the Bayesian analysis and
likelihood function along with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
Further, we analyse the physical behaviour of cosmological parameters such as
density, deceleration, and the EoS parameters corresponding to the constraint
values of the model parameters. The evolution of deceleration parameter
predicts a transition from decelerated to accelerated phases of the universe.
Further, the evolution of equation of state parameter depicts quintessence type

decrease of spatial mobility is interwoven with the emergence of asynchronous
mobility dynamics. The lifting of restriction in urban mobility allowed a
faster recovery of the spatial dimension compared to the temporal one.
Moreover, the recovery in mobility was different depending on urbanisation
levels and economic stratification. In rural and low-income areas, the spatial
mobility dimension suffered a more significant disruption when compared to
urbanised and high-income areas. In contrast, the temporal dimension was more

measure the apparent radius change caused by the exoplanet atmosphere. In order
to retrieve the transmission spectrum, the radial velocities, which were
computed over wavelength bins that encompass several spectral orders, were used
to simultaneously fit the Keplerian motion and the RM effect. From this, the
radius ratio was computed as a function of the wavelength, which allows one to
retrieve the low-resolution broadband transmission spectrum of a given

offers the possibility to use some methods that could, in theory, mitigate the
effect of perturbation in the radial velocities during transits. The CaRM code
allows one to retrieve the transmission spectrum of a given exoplanet using
minimal user interaction. We demonstrate that it allows one to compute the

strongly influenced by the complicated interplay between linear and circular
polarizations. This complexity has been captured in a sophisticated magnetic
Thomson scattering simulation we recently developed to model the outer layers
of fully-ionized atmospheres in such compact objects, heretofore focusing on
case studies of localized surface regions. Yet, the interpretation of observed
intensity pulse profiles and their efficacy in constraining key neutron star
geometry parameters is critically dependent upon adding up emission from
extended surface regions. In this paper, intensity, anisotropy and polarization
characteristics from such extended atmospheres, spanning considerable ranges of
magnetic colatitudes, are determined using our transport simulation. These
constitute a convolution of varied properties of Stokes parameter information
at disparate surface locales with different magnetic field strengths and
directions relative to the local zenith. Our analysis includes full general
relativistic propagation of light from the surface to an observer at infinity.

We start by showing some easy results concerning the power word problem. In
particular, the power word problem for a group $G$ is $NC^1$-many-one reducible
to the power word problem for a finite-index subgroup of $G$.
  For our main result, we consider graph products of groups that do not have
elements of order two. We show that the power word problem in a fixed such
graph product is $AC^0$-Turing-reducible to the word problem for the free group
$F_2$ and the power word problems of the base groups. Furthermore, we look into
the uniform power word problem in a graph product, where the dependence graph
and the base groups are part of the input. Given a class of finitely generated
groups $\mathcal{C}$ without order two elements, the uniform power word problem
in a graph product can be solved in
$\mathsf{AC^0(C_=L^{UPowWP(\mathcal{C})})}$, where $UPowWP(\mathcal{C})$
denotes the uniform power word problem for groups from the class $\mathcal{C}$.
As a consequence of our results, the uniform knapsack problem in right-angled
Artin groups is NP-complete.

[StoberW22] and previous iterations of this paper our results on graph products

fraction of users to share real-time information and short situational messages
during disasters. A summary of these tweets is required by the government
organizations, agencies, and volunteers for efficient and quick disaster
response. However, the huge influx of tweets makes it difficult to manually get
a precise overview of ongoing events. To handle this challenge, several tweet
summarization approaches have been proposed. In most of the existing
literature, tweet summarization is broken into a two-step process where in the
first step, it categorizes tweets, and in the second step, it chooses
representative tweets from each category. There are both supervised as well as
unsupervised approaches found in literature to solve the problem of first step.
Supervised approaches requires huge amount of labelled data which incurs cost
as well as time. On the other hand, unsupervised approaches could not clusters
tweet properly due to the overlapping keywords, vocabulary size, lack of
understanding of semantic meaning etc. While, for the second step of
summarization, existing approaches applied different ranking methods where
those ranking methods are very generic which fail to compute proper importance
of a tweet respect to a disaster. Both the problems can be handled far better
with proper domain knowledge. In this paper, we exploited already existing
domain knowledge by the means of ontology in both the steps and proposed a

Linear response of the system in this state is different from its response near

localized regions of active regions during solar flares called magnetic
imprints (MIs), have been observed for the past nearly three decades. The well
known ""coronal implosion"" model is assumed to explain such flare associated
changes but the complete physical understanding is still missing and debatable.
In this study, we made a systematic analysis of flare-related changes of
photospheric magnetic field during 21 flares (14 eruptive and 7 non-eruptive)
using the high-cadence (\texttt{135s}) vector-magnetogram data obtained from
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. The MI regions for eruptive flares are found
to be strongly localised, whereas the majority of non-eruptive events
($>70~\%$) have scattered imprint regions. To quantify the strength of the MIs,
we derived the integrated change of horizontal field and total change of
Lorentz force over an area. These quantities correlate well with the flare
strength, irrespective of whether flares being eruptive or not, short or long
duration. Further, the free-energy (FE), determined from virial-theorem
estimates, exhibits statistically significant downward trend which starts
around the flare time is observed in majority of flares. The change of FE
during flares do not depend on eruptivity but have a strong positive
correlation ($\approx 0.8$) with the Lorentz force change, indicating that the
part of FE released would penetrate into the photosphere. While these results
strongly favor the idea of significant feedback from corona on the photospheric
magnetic field, the characteristics of MIs are quite indistinguishable for
flares being eruptive or not.

data of CO(1-0) at a resolution of ~100 pc, and CO(3-2) and its underlying
continuum emission at ~40 pc. These observations allow us to probe a range of
molecular gas densities (n(H2)~10$^{3-5}cm^{-3}$). The SF rate (SFR) is derived
from Pa$\alpha$ line emission imaged by HST/NICMOS. We analysed how SF
relations change depending on the choice of aperture sizes and molecular gas
tracer. The scatter in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation is about a factor of two
to three lower for the HCN and HCO+ lines compared to CO(1-0) for a common
aperture. Correlations lose statistical significance below a critical spatial
scale $\approx$300-400 pc. The SF efficiency of the dense molecular gas
(SFEdense) shows a scattered distribution as a function of the HCN luminosity
(L'(HCN)) around a mean value of $\simeq0.01$Myr$^{-1}$. An alternative
prescription for SF relations, linking the SFEdense and the boundedness of the
gas measured by the parameter b$\equiv\Sigma$dense/$\sigma^2$, where
$\Sigma$dense is the dense molecular gas surface density and $\sigma$ the
velocity dispersion, resolves the degeneracy associated with the
SFEdense-L'(HCN) plot. We identify two branches in the SFEdense-b plot that
correspond to two dynamical environments in the SB ring, which are defined by
their proximity to the bar-ring interface region. This region corresponds to
the crossing of two density wave resonances, where an increased rate of
cloud-cloud collisions would favour an enhanced compression of molecular gas.
Our results suggest that galactic dynamics plays a major role in the efficiency
of the gas conversion into stars.

indicate the presence of lifestyle politics -- when ideas and behaviors not
inherently political become politically aligned through their connections with
explicitly political things. We study the pervasiveness of polarization and
lifestyle politics over different product segments in a diverse market and test
the extent to which consumer- and platform-level network effects and morality
may explain lifestyle politics. Specifically, using graph and language data
from Amazon (82.5M reviews of 9.5M products and product and category metadata
from 1996-2014), we sample 234.6 million relations among 21.8 million market
entities to find product categories that are most politically relevant,
aligned, and polarized. We then extract moral values present in reviews' text
and use these data and other reviewer-, product-, and category-level data to
test whether individual- and platform- level network factors explain lifestyle
politics better than products' implicit morality. We find pervasive lifestyle
politics. Cultural products are 4 times more polarized than any other segment,
products' political attributes have up to 3.7 times larger associations with
lifestyle politics than author-level covariates, and morality has statistically
significant but relatively small correlations with lifestyle politics.
Examining lifestyle politics in these contexts helps us better understand the

even an optimal time when time-integrated current fluctuations mostly lie below
the average. We demonstrate that these effects result from the non-monotonic
skewness of current fluctuations and provide evidence that they are easily
observable in experiments. We also discuss their extensions to discrete space
Markov jump processes and implications to biological and synthetic microscopic
engines.

increasing efforts to encourage data sharing, both the quality of shared data,

major reason for this unfortunate state of affairs is that the organization of
research results in the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
(FAIR) form required for reuse is too often deferred to the end of a research
project, when preparing publications, by which time essential details are no
longer accessible. Thus, we propose an approach to research informatics that
applies FAIR principles continuously, from the very inception of a research
project, and ubiquitously, to every data asset produced by experiment or
computation. We suggest that this seemingly challenging task can be made
feasible by the adoption of simple tools, such as lightweight identifiers (to
ensure that every data asset is findable), packaging methods (to facilitate
understanding of data contents), data access methods, and metadata organization
and structuring tools (to support schema development and evolution). We use an
example from experimental neuroscience to illustrate how these methods can work
in practice.

interpretation of the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ anomaly is excluded by the previously
proposed bounds, BR$(B_c\to\tau\nu)\le 30\%$ and $\le10\%$, $H^-$ can still
explain the anomaly within $1\sigma$ if we adopt the 63$\%$ one. The scalar
contribution is also favored by the polarization data $F_L^{D^*}$ measured at
the Belle. Since the implied NP scale is within the reach of the Large Hadron

instance, the $\tau\nu$ resonance search has already put the more stringent

generation system decreases the overall system inertia and negatively impacts
the stability of its primary frequency response. The lowered inertia is due to
the absence of inertia in some of the renewable energy-based systems. To
maintain the stability of the system, we need to keep the frequency in the
permissible limits and maintain low rotational inertia. Some authors in the
literature have used the virtual synchronous generators (VSG) as a solution to
this problem. Although the VSG based distributed recourses (DER) exhibits the
characteristics and behavior of synchronous generators (SG) such as inertia,
frequency droop functions and damping but it does not optimally solve the
question of frequency stability. This paper presents a solution for these
problems via an empirical model that sizes the Battery Energy Storage System
(BESS) required for the inertia emulation and damping control. The tested
system consists of a Photovoltaic (PV) based VSG that is connected to a 9-Bus
grid and the simulation experiments are carried out using EMTP software. The
VSG transient response is initiated by a symmetric fault on the grid side. Our
simulations show the battery energy sizing required to emulate the virtual
inertia corresponding to several design parameters, i.e., the droop gain,
K{\omega}, the droop coefficient, Kd, and the VSG time constant Ta.

motion artifacts in computed tomography reconstructions despite fast
acquisition of individual views. In cases such as cardiac imaging, motion may
be unavoidable and evaluating motion may be of clinical interest.
Reconstructing images with reduced motion artifacts has typically been achieved
by developing systems with faster gantry rotation or using algorithms which
measure and/or estimate the displacements. However, these approaches have had
limited success due to both physical constraints as well as the challenge of
estimating/measuring non-rigid, temporally varying, and patient-specific
motions. We propose a novel reconstruction framework, NeuralCT, to generate
time-resolved images free from motion artifacts. Our approaches utilizes a
neural implicit approach and does not require estimation or modeling of the
underlying motion. Instead, boundaries are represented using a signed distance
metric and neural implicit framework. We utilize `analysis-by-synthesis' to
identify a solution consistent with the acquired sinogram as well as spatial
and temporal consistency constraints. We illustrate the utility of NeuralCT in
three progressively more complex scenarios: translation of a small circle,
heartbeat-like change in an ellipse's diameter, and complex topological
deformation. Without hyperparameter tuning or change to the architecture,
NeuralCT provides high quality image reconstruction for all three motions, as
compared to filtered backprojection, using mean-square-error and Dice metrics.

project \textit{Galaxy Zoo: Clump Scout}, in which volunteers classified over
58,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies spanning redshift $0.02 < z <
0.15$. We apply a robust completeness correction by comparing with simulated
clumps identified by the same method. Requiring that the ratio of
clump-to-galaxy flux in the SDSS $u$ band be greater than 8\% (similar to clump
definitions used by other works), we estimate the fraction of local galaxies
hosting at least one clump ($f_{clumpy}$) to be $2.68_{-0.30}^{+0.33}\%$. We
also compute the same fraction with a less stringent cut of 3\%
($11.33_{-1.16}^{+0.89}\%$), as the higher number count and lower statistical
noise of this fraction permits sharper comparison with future low-redshift
clumpy galaxy studies. Our results reveal a sharp decline in $f_{clumpy}$ over
$0 < z < 0.5$. The minor merger rate remains roughly constant over the same
span, so we suggest that minor mergers are unlikely to be the primary driver of
clump formation. Instead, the rate of galaxy turbulence is a better tracer for
$f_{clumpy}$ over $0 < z < 1.5$ for galaxies of all masses, which supports the
idea that clump formation is primarily driven by violent disk instability for
all galaxy populations during this period.

others are observed scattered throughout star forming regions or in complete
isolation. It has been intensively debated whether the scattered or isolated
stars originate in star clusters, or if they form truly isolated, which could
help constrain the possibilities how massive stars are formed. We adopt the
assumption that all stars form in gravitationally bound star clusters embedded
in molecular cloud cores ($\Gamma$-$1\;$ model), which expel their natal gas,
and compare the fraction of stars found in clusters with observational data.
The star clusters are modelled by the code nbody6, which includes stellar and
circumbinary evolution, gas expulsion, and the external gravitational field of
their host galaxy. We find that small changes in the assumptions in the current
theoretical model estimating the fraction, $\Gamma$, of stars forming in
embedded clusters have a large influence on the results, and we present a
counterexample as an illustration. This calls into question theoretical
arguments about $\Gamma$ in embedded clusters, and it suggests that there is no
firm theoretical ground for low $\Gamma$ in galaxies with lower star formation
rates (SFRs). Instead, the assumption that all stars form in embedded clusters
is in agreement with observational data for the youngest stars (age $\lesssim
10$ Myr). In the $\Gamma$-$1\;$ scenario, the observed fraction of the youngest
stars in clusters increases with the SFR only weakly; the increase is caused by
the presence of more massive clusters in galaxies with higher SFRs, which
release fewer stars to the field in proportion to their mass. The
$\Gamma$-$1\;$ model yields a higher fraction of stars in clusters for older
stars (age between $10$ and $300$ Myr) than what is observed. This discrepancy
can be caused by interactions with molecular clouds.

early universe. Previous 1D radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations show that
increased radiation pressure on dust further suppresses the accretion rate than
the case for the chemically pristine gas. Using the Enzo+Moray code, we perform
a suite of 3D RHD simulations of accreting BHs in a dusty interstellar medium
(ISM). We use the modified Grackle cooling library to consider dust physics in
its non-equilibrium chemistry. The BH goes through an early evolutionary phase,
where ionizing BH radiation creates an oscillating HII region as it cycles
between accretion and feedback. As the simulations proceed, dense cold gas
accumulates outside the ionized region where inflow from the neutral medium
meets the outflow driven by radiation pressure. In the late phase, high-density
gas streams develop and break the quasi-spherical symmetry of the ionized
region, rapidly boosting the accretion rate. The late phase is characterized by
the coexistence of strong ionized outflows and fueling high-density gas
inflows. The mean accretion rate increases with metallicity reaching a peak at
Z$\sim$0.01-0.1$\,Z_\odot$, one order of magnitude higher than the one for
pristine gas. However, as the metallicity approaches the solar abundance, the
mean accretion rate drops as the radiation pressure becomes strong enough to
drive out the high-density gas. Our results indicate that a dusty metal-poor
ISM can accelerate the growth rate of BHs in the early universe, however, can
stun its growth as the ISM is further enriched toward the solar abundance.

bugs in DL systems can be disastrous, and can even threaten human lives in
safety-critical applications. To date, a huge body of research efforts have
been dedicated to testing DL models. However, interestingly, there is still
limited work for testing the underlying DL libraries, which are the foundation
for building, optimizing, and running DL models. One potential reason is that
test generation for the underlying DL libraries can be rather challenging since
their public APIs are mainly exposed in Python, making it even hard to
automatically determine the API input parameter types due to dynamic typing. In
this paper, we propose FreeFuzz, the first approach to fuzzing DL libraries via
mining from open source. More specifically, FreeFuzz obtains code/models from
three different sources: 1) code snippets from the library documentation, 2)
library developer tests, and 3) DL models in the wild. Then, FreeFuzz
automatically runs all the collected code/models with instrumentation to trace
the dynamic information for each covered API, including the types and values of
each parameter during invocation, and shapes of input/output tensors. Lastly,
FreeFuzz will leverage the traced dynamic information to perform fuzz testing
for each covered API. The extensive study of FreeFuzz on PyTorch and
TensorFlow, two of the most popular DL libraries, shows that FreeFuzz is able
to automatically trace valid dynamic information for fuzzing 1158 popular APIs,
9X more than state-of-the-art LEMON with 3.5X lower overhead than LEMON. To
date, FreeFuzz has detected 49 bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow (with 38 already

multiple major emission lines remains a question. Here we derive the general
shapes of the ionizing spectra for three local extremely metal-poor galaxies
(EMPGs) that show strong HeII$\lambda$4686. We parameterize the ionizing
spectra composed of a blackbody and power-law radiation mimicking various
stellar and non-thermal sources. We use photoionization models for nebulae, and
determine seven parameters of the ionizing spectra and nebulae by Markov Chain
Monte Carlo methods, carefully avoiding systematics of abundance ratios. We
obtain the general shapes of ionizing spectra explaining $\sim 10$ major
emission lines within observational errors with smooth connections from
observed X-ray and optical continua. We find that an ionizing spectrum of one
EMPG has a blackbody-dominated shape, while the others have convex downward
shapes at $>13.6$ eV, which indicate a diversity of the ionizing spectrum
shapes. We confirm that the convex downward shapes are fundamentally different
from ordinary stellar spectrum shapes, and that the spectrum shapes of these
galaxies are generally explained by the combination of the stellar and
ultra-luminous X-ray sources. Comparisons with stellar synthesis models suggest
that the diversity of the spectrum shapes arises from differences in the
stellar age. If galaxies at $z\gtrsim 6$ are similar to the EMPGs, high energy
($>54.4$ eV) photons of the non-stellar sources negligibly contribute to cosmic
reionization due to relatively weak radiation.

(RCT) participants and the target population, evaluating the treatment effect
solely based on the RCT often leads to biased quantification of the real-world
treatment effect. To address the problem of lack of generalizability for the
treatment effect estimated by the RCT sample, we leverage observational studies
with large samples that are representative of the target population. This paper
concerns evaluating treatment effects on survival outcomes for a target
population and considers a broad class of estimands that are functionals of
treatment-specific survival functions, including differences in survival
probability and restricted mean survival times. Motivated by two intuitive but
distinct approaches, i.e., imputation based on survival outcome regression and
weighting based on inverse probability of sampling, censoring, and treatment
assignment, we propose a semiparametric estimator through the guidance of the
efficient influence function. The proposed estimator is doubly robust in the
sense that it is consistent for the target population estimands if either the
survival model or the weighting model is correctly specified, and is locally
efficient when both are correct. In addition, as an alternative to parametric
estimation, we employ the nonparametric method of sieves for flexible and
robust estimation of the nuisance functions and show that the resulting
estimator retains the root-n consistency and efficiency, the so-called it
rate-double robustness. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical properties

whether a characterization exists of problems that do have such solutions. In
this article, we answer these questions by linking the existence of solutions
that simultaneously optimize the class of Schur-convex functions, called least
majorized elements, to (bi)submodular functions and the corresponding
polyhedra. For this, we introduce a generalization of majorization and least
majorized elements, called $(a,b)$-majorization and least $(a,b)$-majorized

adjudication mechanisms that use (1) majority voting to decide the final

and possibly punish the ones in the minority. Agents interact with such a
mechanism strategically: they exert some effort to understand how to properly

on information they have about the rest of the votes. Eventually, they vote so
that their utility (i.e., their payment from the mechanism minus the cost due

learning has lead to vast improvements in the area of autonomous process
supervision. However, the more complex and powerful these models become, the
less transparent and explainable they generally are as well. One of the main
challenges is the monitoring of live deployments of these machine learning
systems and raising alerts when encountering events that might impact model
performance. In particular, supervised classifiers are typically build under
the assumption of stationarity in the underlying data distribution. For
example, a visual inspection system trained on a set of material surface
defects generally does not adapt or even recognize gradual changes in the data
distribution - an issue known as ""data drift"" - such as the emergence of new
types of surface defects. This, in turn, may lead to detrimental
mispredictions, e.g. samples from new defect classes being classified as
non-defective. To this end, it is desirable to provide real-time tracking of a
classifier's performance to inform about the putative onset of additional error
classes and the necessity for manual intervention with respect to classifier
re-training. Here, we propose an unsupervised framework that acts on top of a
supervised classification system, thereby harnessing its internal deep feature
representations as a proxy to track changes in the data distribution during
deployment and, hence, to anticipate classifier performance degradation.

distributed type of galaxies. Hence, they are key to testing theories of galaxy
and Universe evolution. Dwarf galaxies sufficiently close to have their gas and
stellar components studied in detail are of particular interest, because their
properties and their evolution can be inferred with accuracy. This Review
summarizes what is known of the stellar and chemical properties of star-forming
dwarf galaxies closer than $\sim$20 Mpc. Given their low metallicity, high gas
content and ongoing star formation, these objects are supposed to resemble the
first galaxies that formed at the earliest epochs, and may thus represent a
window on the distant, early Universe. We describe the major results obtained
in the past decade on the star formation histories, chemical abundances, galaxy
formation and evolution of star-forming dwarfs, and the uncertainties still
affecting these results.

(shifts) in time series. Our locally adaptive model-based approach for robustly
decoupling combines Bayesian trend filtering and machine learning based
regularization. An over-parameterized Bayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is
first applied to characterize drift. Then a weighted penalized likelihood
estimator is paired with the estimated DLM posterior distribution to identify
shifts. We show how Bayesian DLMs specified with so-called shrinkage priors can
provide smooth estimates of underlying trends in the presence of complex noise
components. However, their inability to shrink exactly to zero inhibits direct
changepoint detection. In contrast, penalized likelihood methods are highly
effective in locating changepoints. However, they require data with simple
patterns in both signal and noise. The proposed decoupling approach combines
the strengths of both, i.e.\ the flexibility of Bayesian DLMs with the hard
thresholding property of penalized likelihood estimators, to provide
changepoint analysis in complex, modern settings. The proposed framework is
outlier robust and can identify a variety of changes, including in mean and
slope. It is also easily extended for analysis of parameter shifts in
time-varying parameter models like dynamic regressions. We illustrate the
flexibility and contrast the performance and robustness of our approach with
several alternative methods across a wide range of simulations and application

plasmon resonance (LSPR). This laid the foundation for a wide range of
applications, including nanoscale optics, solar energy harvesting,
photocatalysis, and biosensing. However, there are inherent problems associated
with plasmonic metals, such as high heating losses, and their inability to be

the broader use of PMNs in practical applications. In this work, we report
submicron cupric oxide (CuO) particles with a medium refractive index that can
exhibit strong electric and magnetic Mie resonances with strong
extinction/scattering cross-sections comparable to or slightly exceeding those
of their plasmonic counterparts. Through the development of particle synthesis
techniques with strong shape and size control, optical spectroscopy, and
finite-difference-time-domain simulations we show that the Mie resonance peak
wavelengths are size- and shape-dependent. This gives tunability in the visible

Therefore, submicron CuO particles exhibit strong potential in emerging as

policy in order to achieve some common objective. The successful deployment of
such systems hinges on the availability of reliable inter-agent communication.
However, many sources of potential disruption to communication exist in
practice, such as radio interference, hardware failure, and adversarial
attacks. In this work, we develop joint policies for cooperative multiagent
systems that are robust to potential losses in communication. More
specifically, we develop joint policies for cooperative Markov games with
reach-avoid objectives. First, we propose an algorithm for the decentralized
execution of joint policies during periods of communication loss. Next, we use
the total correlation of the state-action process induced by a joint policy as
a measure of the intrinsic dependencies between the agents. We then use this
measure to lower-bound the performance of a joint policy when communication is
lost. Finally, we present an algorithm that maximizes a proxy to this lower
bound in order to synthesize minimum-dependency joint policies that are robust
to communication loss. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
minimum-dependency policies require minimal coordination between the agents
while incurring little to no loss in performance; the total correlation value
of the synthesized policy is one fifth of the total correlation value of the
baseline policy which does not take potential communication losses into
account. As a result, the performance of the minimum-dependency policies
remains consistently high regardless of whether or not communication is
available. By contrast, the performance of the baseline policy decreases by
twenty percent when communication is lost.

datacenters by dynamically optimizing the physical network in a demand-aware
manner. State-of-the-art optical technologies allow to establish and update
direct connectivity (in the form of edge-disjoint matchings) between
top-of-rack switches within microseconds or less. However, to fully exploit
temporal structure in the demand, such fine-grained reconfigurations also
require fast algorithms for optimizing the interconnecting matchings.
  Motivated by the desire to offload a maximum amount of demand to the
reconfigurable network, this paper initiates the study of fast algorithms to
find k disjoint heavy matchings in graphs. We present and analyze six
algorithms, based on iterative matchings, b-matching, edge coloring, and
node-rankings. We show that the problem is generally NP-hard and study the
achievable approximation ratios.
  An extensive empirical evaluation of our algorithms on both real-world and
synthetic traces (88 in total), including traces collected in Facebook
datacenters and in HPC clusters reveals that all our algorithms provide
high-quality matchings, and also very fast ones come within 95% or more of the
best solution. However, the running times differ significantly and what is the
best algorithm depends on k and the acceptable runtime-quality tradeoff.

multiple access (RSMA) to the downlink (DL) of a massive

channel reciprocity in such systems, explicit training in the DL has to be
performed in order to gain knowledge about the single-antenna users' channels
at the base station (BS). This is ensured through a feedback link from the
users to the BS. Dealing with the DL of a massive MIMO system implies that
acquiring the DL channel state information (CSI) comes at the cost of a huge
training overhead that scales with the number of BS antennas. Therefore, we
limit the resources allocated to training by reusing the pilot sequences among
the BS antennas that results in a contaminated channel observation. Despite
this incomplete channel knowledge at the transmitter side, the proposed RS

for various applications; however, the machine learning (ML) models for
UAV-based detection are often validated using data curated for tasks unrelated
to the UAV application. This is a concern because training neural networks on
large-scale benchmarks have shown excellent capability in generic object
detection tasks, yet conventional training approaches can lead to large
inference errors for UAV-based images. Such errors arise due to differences in
imaging conditions between images from UAVs and images in training. To overcome
this problem, we characterize boundary conditions of ML models, beyond which
the models exhibit rapid degradation in detection accuracy. Our work is focused
on understanding the impact of different UAV-based imaging conditions on
detection performance by using synthetic data generated using a game engine.
Properties of the game engine are exploited to populate the synthetic datasets
with realistic and annotated images. Specifically, it enables the fine control
of various parameters, such as camera position, view angle, illumination
conditions, and object pose. Using the synthetic datasets, we analyze detection
accuracy in different imaging conditions as a function of the above parameters.
We use three well-known neural network models with different model complexity
in our work. In our experiment, we observe and quantify the following: 1) how
detection accuracy drops as the camera moves toward the nadir-view region; 2)
how detection accuracy varies depending on different object poses, and 3) the
degree to which the robustness of the models changes as illumination conditions
vary.

the location of the boundary/interface within the cell. One can prove enhanced
stability results, not only on the physical domain, but on the whole active
mesh. However, the stability constants grow exponentially with the polynomial
order being used, since the underlying extension operators are defined via
extrapolation. To address this issue, we introduce a new variant of aggregated
finite elements, in which the extension in the physical domain is an
interpolation for polynomials of order higher than two. As a result, the
stability constants only grow at a polynomial rate with the order of
approximation. We demonstrate that this approach enables robust high-order

is consistent, optimally convergent, and with a condition number that scales

We calculate the various two-body decay widths of a light modulus field into
MSSM particles and gravitinos within general supersymmetric models. We include
both phase space and mixing effects. We examine cases without and with helicity
suppression of modulus decays to gravitinos (cases 1 & 2) and/or gauginos
(cases A & B). For case B1, we evaluate regions of gravitino mass m_{3/2} vs.
modulus mass m_\phi parameter space constrained by BBN, by overproduction of
gravitinos and by overproduction of neutralino dark matter, along with
connections to naturalness. For this case, essentially all of parameter space

potentially most propitious case B2 with \phi decay to Higgs and matter turned
off, then modulus branching fractions to SUSY and to gravitinos become highly
suppressed at large m_\phi. But since the modulus number density increases
faster than the branching fractions decrease, there is still gross
overproduction of neutralino dark matter. We also show that in this scenario
the thermally produced gravitino problem is fixed by huge entropy dilution, but
non-thermal gravitino production from moduli decay remains a huge problem

However, the political discourse is increasingly characterized by hate speech,
which affects not only the reputation of individual politicians but also the
functioning of society at large. In this work, we empirically analyze how the
amount of hate speech in replies to posts from politicians on Twitter depends
on personal characteristics, such as their party affiliation, gender, and
ethnicity. For this purpose, we employ Twitter's Historical API to collect
every tweet posted by members of the 117th U.S. Congress for an observation
period of more than six months. Additionally, we gather replies for each tweet
and use machine learning to predict the amount of hate speech they embed.
Subsequently, we implement hierarchical regression models to analyze whether
politicians with certain characteristics receive more hate speech. We find that
tweets are particularly likely to receive hate speech in replies if they are
authored by (i) persons of color from the Democratic party, (ii) white
Republicans, and (iii) women. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more
negative sentiment (in the source tweet) is associated with more hate speech
(in replies). However, the association varies across parties: negative
sentiment attracts more hate speech for Democrats (vs. Republicans).
Altogether, our empirical findings imply significant differences in how
politicians are treated on social media depending on their party affiliation,

personal user data and adverse impacts of corrupted data like backdoors or
systematic bias. Machine Unlearning can address these by allowing post-hoc
deletion of affected training data from a learned model. Achieving this task
exactly is computationally expensive; consequently, recent works have proposed
inexact unlearning algorithms to solve this approximately as well as evaluation
methods to test the effectiveness of these algorithms.
  In this work, we first outline some necessary criteria for evaluation methods
and show no existing evaluation satisfies them all. Then, we design a stronger
black-box evaluation method called the Interclass Confusion (IC) test which
adversarially manipulates data during training to detect the insufficiency of
unlearning procedures. We also propose two analytically motivated baseline
methods~(EU-k and CF-k) which outperform several popular inexact unlearning
methods. Overall, we demonstrate how adversarial evaluation strategies can help
in analyzing various unlearning phenomena which can guide the development of
stronger unlearning algorithms.

transportation, robust perception across a wide range of driving contexts
remains a significant challenge. Techniques to fuse sensor data from camera,
radar, and lidar sensors have been proposed to improve AV perception. However,
existing methods are insufficiently robust in difficult driving contexts (e.g.,
bad weather, low light, sensor obstruction) due to rigidity in their fusion
implementations. These methods fall into two broad categories: (i) early
fusion, which fails when sensor data is noisy or obscured, and (ii) late
fusion, which cannot leverage features from multiple sensors and thus produces
worse estimates. To address these limitations, we propose HydraFusion: a
selective sensor fusion framework that learns to identify the current driving
context and fuses the best combination of sensors to maximize robustness
without compromising efficiency. HydraFusion is the first approach to propose
dynamically adjusting between early fusion, late fusion, and combinations
in-between, thus varying both how and when fusion is applied. We show that, on
average, HydraFusion outperforms early and late fusion approaches by 13.66% and
14.54%, respectively, without increasing computational complexity or energy
consumption on the industry-standard Nvidia Drive PX2 AV hardware platform. We
also propose and evaluate both static and deep-learning-based context
identification strategies. Our open-source code and model implementation are

  Dynamic Environments",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Obstacle avoidance of quadrotors in dynamic environments is still a very open
problem. Current works commonly leverage traditional static maps to represent
static obstacles and the detection and tracking of moving objects (DATMO)
method to model dynamic obstacles separately. The detection module requires
pre-training, and the dynamic obstacles can only be modeled with certain
shapes, such as cylinders or ellipsoids. This work utilizes the dual-structure
particle-based (DSP) dynamic occupancy map to represent the arbitrary-shaped
static obstacles and dynamic obstacles simultaneously, and proposes an
efficient risk-aware sampling-based local trajectory planner to realize safe
flights in this map. The trajectory is planned by sampling motion primitives
generated in the state space. Each motion primitive is divided into two phases:
a short-term phase with a strict risk limitation and a relatively long-term
phase designed to avoid high-risk regions. The risk is evaluated with the
predicted particle-form future occupancy status, considering the time
dimension. With an approach to split from and merge to an arbitrary global
trajectory, the planner can also be used in the tasks with preplanned global
trajectories. Comparison experiments show that the obstacle avoidance system
composed of the DSP map and our planner performs the best in dynamic
environments. In real-world tests, our quadrotor reaches a speed of 6 m/s with
the motion capture system and 2.5 m/s with everything running on a low-price
single-board computer.

conducting such tests. The testing procedure is also computationally tractable
and relatively straightforward to implement. In contrast to some alternative
test statistics, the proposed entropy test is free from user-specified kernel
and bandwidth choices, idiosyncratic and complex regularity conditions, and/or
choices of evaluation grids. Several simulation exercises were performed to
document the empirical performance of our proposed test, including a regression
example that is illustrative of how, in some contexts, the approach can be
applied to composite hypothesis-testing situations via data transformations.
Overall, the testing procedure exhibits notable promise, exhibiting appreciable
increasing power as sample size increases for a number of alternative
distributions when contrasted with hypothesized null distributions. Possible
general extensions of the approach to composite hypothesis-testing contexts,
and directions for future work are also discussed.

wave beams is presented in the case when the source is partially coherent. A
Gaussian-Schell model is used for the partially coherent random source. The
white-noise paraxial regime is considered, which holds when the wavelength is
much smaller than the correlation radius of the source, the beam radius of the
source, and the correlation length of the medium, which are themselves much
smaller than the propagation distance. The complex wave amplitude field can

the fourth order equations are considered. The general fourth moment equations
are solved explicitly in the scintillation regime (when the correlation radius

the beam radius is much larger) and the result gives a characterization of the

We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an NPDG

potential to bounce back. A failure to integrate equity into resilience
considerations results in unequal recovery and disproportionate impacts on
vulnerable populations, which has long been a concern in the United States.
This research investigated aspects of equity related to community resilience in
the aftermath of Winter Storm Uri in Texas which led to extended power outages
for more than 4 million households. County level outage and recovery data was
analyzed to explore potential significant links between various county
attributes and their share of the outages during the recovery and restoration
phases. Next, satellite imagery was used to examine data at a much higher
geographical resolution focusing on census tracts in the city of Houston. The
goal was to use computer vision to extract the extent of outages within census
tracts and investigate their linkages to census tracts attributes. Results from
various statistical procedures revealed statistically significant negative
associations between counties' percentage of non-Hispanic whites and median
household income with the ratio of outages. Additionally, at census tract
level, variables including percentages of linguistically isolated population
and public transport users exhibited positive associations with the group of
census tracts that were affected by the outage as detected by computer vision
analysis. Informed by these results, engineering solutions such as the
applicability of grid modernization technologies, together with distributed and

radio-frequency currents versus the two-dimensional coordinates of the
superconducting resonant structure under test. Phase-sensitive contrast is
achieved by synchronizing the intensity-modulated laser radiation with the
resonant harmonics of the microwave signal passing through the sample. In this
case, the laser-beam-induced loss in the illuminated area will strongly depend
on the local phase difference between the RF carrier signal and the spatially
temporal structure of the focused laser oscillation. This approach eliminates
the hardware limitations of the existing technique of radio-frequency
microscopy and brings the phase-sensitive demodulation mode to the level
necessary for studying the physics of superconducting metamaterials. The
advantage of the presented method over the previous method of RF laser scanning
microscopy is demonstrated by the example of the formation of standing waves in
a spiral superconducting Archimedean resonator up to the 38th eigenmode
resonance.

employed to solve convex optimization problems, or more generally finding zeros

inconsistent case, i.e., in the absence of solutions has triggered significant
consideration. It has been shown that under mild assumptions the shadow
sequence of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm converges weakly to a generalized
solution when the underlying operators are subdifferentials of proper lower
semicontinuous convex functions. However, no convergence behaviour has been
proved in the case of Peaceman-Rachford algorithm. In this paper, we prove the
convergence of the shadow sequences associated with the Douglas-Rachford

A framework known as Modern Coexistence Theory
measures mechanisms of coexistence by comparing a species perturbed to low
density (the invader) to other species that remain at their typical densities
(the residents); this invader-resident comparison measures a rare-species
advantage that results from specialization. However, there are several
reasonable ways (i.e., methods) to compare invaders and residents, each
differing in practicality and biological interpretation. Here, using
theoretical arguments and case studies, we compare four such methods for
calculating coexistence mechanisms: 1) Scaling factors, the traditional
approach where resident growth rates are scaled by a measure of relative
sensitivity to competition, obtained by solving a system of linear equations;
2) The simple comparison, which gives equal weight to all resident species; 3)
Speed conversion factors, a novel method in which resident growth rates are
scaled by a ratio of generation times, and; 4) The invader-invader comparison,
another novel method in which a focal species is compared to itself at high vs.
low density. We conclude that the conventional scaling factors can be useful in
some theoretical research, but are not recommended for empirical applications,
i.e., determining the mechanisms of coexistence in real communities. Instead,
we recommend the simple comparison and speed conversion factor methods. The
speed conversion factors are most useful when comparing species with dissimilar
generation times. However, ecologists often study coexistence in guilds of
species with similar life-histories, and therefore, similar generation times.
In such scenarios, the easier-to-use simple comparison method is reasonable.

temperature phases under an external magnetic field using large scale Monte
Carlo simulations. We show that strong geometric frustration, characteristic of
the kagome lattice, and the competition between the effective exchange,
antisymmetric and anisotropic couplings, gives rise to a large variety of
non-trivial topological phases. On the one hand, for antiferromagnetic exchange
coupling a pseudo-antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystal is stabilized for a broad
range of parameters. As the exchange coupling gets smaller, chiral single-q and
double-q phases emerge. On the other hand, in the ferromagnetic case, even
though the competition of the different interactions produce a series of exotic
textures, a remarkable parallel may be drawn with the pure ferromagnetic model

an incremental training strategy inspired by transfer and curriculum learning.
We develop a scintillation model and employ an empirical method to generate a
vast catalog of atmospheric noise realizations and train the network with
representative data. We face two complexity axes: the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and the degree of structure in the noise. Hence, we train our recurrent
network to recognize simulated astrophysical point-like sources embedded in
three structured noise levels, with a raw-data SNR ranging from 3 to 0.1. We
find that a slow and repetitive increase in complexity is crucial during
training to obtain a robust and stable learning rate that can transfer
information through different data contexts. We probe our recurrent model with
synthetic observational data, designing alongside a calibration methodology for
flux measurements. Furthermore, we implement a traditional matched filtering
(MF) to compare its performance with our neural network, finding that our final
trained network can successfully clean structured noise and significantly
enhance the SNR compared to raw data and in a more robust way than traditional

comparative experiments of droplet impact on a glass surface using whole blood
and three solutions with a shear viscosity similar to that of blood.
Specifically, we used dog's whole blood (deformable red blood cells dispersed
in plasma, WB), plasma with non-deformable resin particles (PwP), glycerol and
water with resin particles (GWwP), and a commercial blood simulant (hard
particles dispersed in a water-based Newtonian solution, BS). The ranges of
Reynolds and Weber numbers in our experiments were 550 $<Re<$ 1700 and 120
$<We<$ 860, respectively. Side and bottom views of droplet impact were
simultaneously recorded by two high-speed cameras. The spreading radius of the
impacting WB droplet in our experiments agreed well with that of Newtonian
fluids with viscosity similar to that of WB at high shear rates. Splashing
droplets of WB and Newtonian fluids form finger structures (finger-splashing).
Although PwP has a viscosity similar to that of WB at high shear rates, an
impacting PwP droplet exhibited typical characteristics of impacting suspension
droplets, that is, a reduced spreading radius and splashing with ejection of
particles. Such significant differences between impacting droplets of PwP and
WB indicates that the high deformability of red blood cells in WB plays a
crucial role in the Newtonian-like behaviour of blood droplets on impact.
Importantly, the impacting BS droplet behaved quite differently from WB in both
spreading and splashing. Our results imply that the use of deformable particles
rather than hard particles in a BS is essential for mimicking blood droplet
impact.

  1. We first consider general metric spaces. We present a randomized
polynomial time algorithm that returns a factor $2$-approximation to the
diversity but only satisfies the fairness constraints in expectation. Building
upon this result, we present a $6$-approximation that is guaranteed to satisfy

electron spin is a natural resource for long-lived quantum information since it
is mostly impervious to electric fluctuations and can be replicated in large
arrays using silicon quantum dots, which offer high-fidelity control.
Paradoxically, one of the most convenient control strategies is the integration
of nanoscale magnets to artificially enhance the coupling between spins and
electric field, which in turn hampers the spin's noise immunity and adds
architectural complexity. Here we demonstrate a technique that enables a
\emph{switchable} interaction between spins and orbital motion of electrons in
silicon quantum dots, without the presence of a micromagnet. The naturally weak
effects of the relativistic spin-orbit interaction in silicon are enhanced by
more than three orders of magnitude by controlling the energy quantisation of
electrons in the nanostructure, enhancing the orbital motion. Fast electrical
control is demonstrated in multiple devices and electronic configurations,
highlighting the utility of the technique. Using the electrical drive we
achieve coherence time $T_{2,{\rm Hahn}}\approx50 \mu$s, fast single-qubit
gates with ${T_{\pi/2}=3}$ ns and gate fidelities of 99.93 % probed by

the SE errors into noise and artifact components. The artifact component is
defined as the SE error signal that cannot be represented as a linear

that mitigating the artifact can greatly improve ASR performance. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the simple observation adding (OA) technique (i.e., adding
a scaled version of the observed signal to the enhanced speech) can
monotonically increase the signal-to-artifact ratio under a mild condition.
Accordingly, we experimentally confirm that OA improves ASR performance for
both simulated and real recordings. The findings of this paper provide a better
understanding of the influence of SE errors on ASR and open the door to future
research on novel approaches for designing effective single-channel SE

One interpretation states that species coexist by specializing on specific
environmental states, and therefore must have a robust life-stage (e.g.,
long-lived adults, a seed-bank) in order to ""wait it out"" for favorable
conditions. Here we show that this widely employed interpretation can be
misleading. Multiple models show that stage-structure, long lifespans, and
overlapping generations are neither necessary nor sufficient for the storage
effect. In models where a robust life-stage does engender a storage effect, it
does not do so by preventing stochastic extinction or by improving relative
bet-hedging. A robust life-stage is best understood as one of many ways to
fulfill an abstract condition for the storage effect: an interaction effect of
environment and competition on per capita growth rates. Using a dataset of
annual plants from a Mediterranean grassland in Spain, we show that such
interaction effects occur between water availability and the number of
germinant competitors, leading to storage in the absence of a persistent seed
bank. Empiricists hoping to uncover the storage effect should look for

environment. The generality of the storage effect is both a strength - it can
be quantified in many systems - and a challenge - there is not a clear
relationship between the abstract conditions for storage effect and species'
life-history traits (e.g., dormancy, stage-structure, non-overlapping
generations), thus precluding a simple ecological interpretation of the storage
effect. Our goal here is to provide a clearer understanding of the conditions
for the storage effect as a step towards a better general explanation for
coexistence in a variable environment. Our approach focuses on dividing one of
the key conditions for the storage effect, covariance between environment and
competition, into two pieces, namely that there must be a causal relationship
between environment and competition, and that the effects of the environment do
not change too quickly. This finer-grained definition can explain a number of
previous results, including 1) that the storage effect promotes annual plant
coexistence when the germination rate fluctuates, but not when the seed yield
fluctuates, 2) that the storage effect is more likely to be induced by resource
competition than apparent competition, and 3) that the spatial storage effect
is more probable than the temporal storage effect. Additionally, our expanded
definition suggests two novel mechanisms by which the temporal storage effect
can arise: transgenerational plasticity, and causal chains of environmental
variables. These mechanisms produce coexistence via the storage effect without
any need for stage structure or a temporally autocorrelated environment.

performed through multiple stripe analysis to determine its seismic
demand-intensity that can be employed as a sample set. For both univariate and

the two aforementioned methods under the Bayesian regression framework, and the
fitted results were compared and analyzed with the conventional models using
linear regression approaches. In the presence of probabilistic seismic demand
considering heteroscedasticity, the patterns of non-constant variance or

Although a standard non-linear activation function can generate higher model
accuracy, it must be processed via a costly garbled-circuit MPC primitive. A
polynomial activation can be processed via Beaver's multiplication triples MPC
primitive but has been incurring severe accuracy drops so far.
  In this paper, we propose an accuracy preserving low-degree polynomial
activation function (AESPA) that exploits the Hermite expansion of the ReLU and
basis-wise normalization. We apply AESPA to popular ML models, such as VGGNet,
ResNet, and pre-activation ResNet, to show an inference accuracy comparable to
those of the standard models with ReLU activation, achieving superior accuracy
over prior low-degree polynomial studies. When applied to the all-RELU baseline
on the state-of-the-art Delphi PI protocol, AESPA shows up to 42.1x and 28.3x
lower online latency and communication cost.

practice is to present the final population of an EMO algorithm as the output.
However, it has been shown that the final population often includes solutions
which are dominated by other solutions generated and discarded in previous
generations. Recently, a new EMO framework has been proposed to solve this
issue by storing all the non-dominated solutions generated during the evolution
in an archive and selecting a subset of solutions from the archive as the
output. The key component in this framework is the subset selection from the
archive which usually stores a large number of candidate solutions. However,
most studies on subset selection focus on small candidate solution sets for
environmental selection. There is no benchmark test suite for large-scale
subset selection. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing a
benchmark test suite for subset selection from large candidate solution sets,
and comparing some representative methods using the proposed test suite. The
proposed test suite together with the benchmarking studies provides a baseline
for researchers to understand, use, compare, and develop subset selection
methods in the EMO field.

collisions, some researchers state that perfect-merging simulations can still
be considered as quantitatively reliable representations of the final stage of
terrestrial planet formation. Citing the work of Kokubo & Genda [ApJL, 714L,
21], they argue that the differences between the final planets in simulations
with perfect-merging and those where collisions are resolved accurately are
small, and it is, therefore, justified to use perfect-merging results as an
acceptable approximation to realistic simulations. In this paper, we show that
this argument does not stand. We demonstrate that when the mass lost during
collisions is taken into account, the final masses of the planets will be so
different from those obtained from perfect-merging that the latter cannot be
used as a valid approximation. We carried out a large number of SPH simulations
of embryo-embryo collisions and determined the amount of the mass and water
lost in each impact. We applied the results to collisions in a typical
perfect-merging simulation and showed that even when the mass-loss in each
collision is as small as 10%, perfect-merging can, on average, overestimate the
masses of the final planets by $\sim 35\%$ and their water-contents by more
than 18%. Our analysis demonstrates that, while perfect-merging simulations are
still a powerful tool in proving concepts, they cannot be used to make
predictions, draw quantitative conclusions (especially about the past history
of a planetary system) and serve as a valid approximation to, or in lieu of the
simulations in which collisions are resolved accurately.

multi-objective optimization (EMO). It involves in hypervolume-based EMO
algorithms and hypervolume subset selection algorithms. Its main drawback is
that it is computationally expensive in high-dimensional spaces, which limits
its applicability to many-objective optimization. Recently, an R2 indicator
variant (i.e., $R_2^{\text{HVC}}$ indicator) is proposed to approximate the
hypervolume contribution. The $R_2^{\text{HVC}}$ indicator uses line segments
along a number of direction vectors for hypervolume contribution approximation.
It has been shown that different direction vector sets lead to different
approximation quality. In this paper, we propose \textit{Learning to
Approximate (LtA)}, a direction vector set generation method for the
$R_2^{\text{HVC}}$ indicator. The direction vector set is automatically learned
from training data. The learned direction vector set can then be used in the
$R_2^{\text{HVC}}$ indicator to improve its approximation quality. The
usefulness of the proposed LtA method is examined by comparing it with other
commonly-used direction vector set generation methods for the
$R_2^{\text{HVC}}$ indicator. Experimental results suggest the superiority of
LtA over the other methods for generating high quality direction vector sets.

unknown. We assume that the direct observation of the percentage of hidden

noise-corrupted observation process is available. Using the nonlinear filtering
techniques in conjunction with an invasion type analysis (or analysis using
Lyapunov exponents from the dynamical system point of view), this paper proves
that the long-term behavior of the disease is governed by a threshold
$\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$ that depends on the model parameters. It turns out that
if $\lambda<0$ the number $I(t)$ of infected individuals converges to zero
exponentially fast, or the extinction happens. In contrast, if $\lambda>0$, the
infection is endemic and the system is permanent. We showcase our results by
applying them in specific illuminating examples. Numerical simulations are also

laws. We perform numerical modeling of particle acceleration at coronal shocks
propagating through a streamer-like magnetic field by solving the Parker
transport equation, including protons and heavier ions. We find that for all
ion species the energy spectra integrated over the simulation domain can be
described by a double power law, and the break energy depends on the ion
charge-to-mass ratio as $E_B \sim (Q/A)^\alpha$, with $\alpha$ varying from
0.16 to 1.2 by considering different turbulence spectral indices. We suggest
that the double power law distribution may emerge as a result of the
superposition of energetic particles from different source regions where the
acceleration rates differ significantly due to particle diffusion. The
diffusion and mixing of energetic particles could also provide an explanation
for the increase of Fe/O at high energies as observed in some SEP events.
Although further mixing processes may occur, our simulations indicate that
either power-law break or rollover can occur near the Sun and predict that the
spectral forms vary significantly along the shock front, which may be examined
by upcoming near-Sun SEP measurements from Parker Solar Probe and Solar

natural to improve the robustness to noise of the optimization algorithm which
updates the network parameters in the final process of learning. Previous works
revealed that the first momentum used in Adam-like stochastic gradient descent
optimizers can be modified based on the Student's t-distribution to produce
updates robust to noise. In this paper, we propose AdaTerm which derives not
only the first momentum but also all of the involved statistics based on the
Student's t-distribution, providing for the first time a unified treatment of
the optimization process under the t-distribution statistical model. When the
computed gradients statistically appear to be aberrant, AdaTerm excludes them
from the update and reinforce its robustness for subsequent updates; otherwise,
it normally updates the network parameters and relaxes its robustness for the
following updates. With this noise-adaptive behavior, AdaTerm's excellent
learning performance was confirmed via typical optimization problems with
several cases where the noise ratio is different and/or unknown. In addition,
we proved a new general trick for deriving a theoretical regret bound without

objective is not only to find a good representation of the Pareto-optimal front
(PF) in the objective space but also to find all equivalent Pareto-optimal
subsets (PSS) in the variable space. Such problems are practically relevant
when a decision maker (DM) is interested in identifying alternative designs
with similar performance. There has been significant research interest in
recent years to develop efficient algorithms to deal with MMOPs. However, the
existing algorithms still require prohibitive number of function evaluations
(often in several thousands) to deal with problems involving as low as two
objectives and two variables. The algorithms are typically embedded with
sophisticated, customized mechanisms that require additional parameters to
manage the diversity and convergence in the variable and the objective spaces.
In this letter, we introduce a steady-state evolutionary algorithm for solving
MMOPs, with a simple design and no additional userdefined parameters that need
tuning compared to a standard EA. We report its performance on 21 MMOPs from
various test suites that are widely used for benchmarking using a low
computational budget of 1000 function evaluations. The performance of the
proposed algorithm is compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms (MO Ring
PSO SCD, DN-NSGAII, TriMOEA-TA&R, CPDEA, MMOEA/DC and MMEA-WI). The proposed
algorithm exhibits significantly better performance than the above algorithms
based on the established metrics including IGDX, PSP and IGD. We hope this
study would encourage design of simple, efficient and generalized algorithms to
improve its uptake for practical applications.

that documents crucial information about changes, such as new features and bug
fixes. With the help of release notes, both developers and users could have a
general understanding of the latest version without browsing the source code.
However, it is a daunting and time-consuming job for developers to produce
release notes. Although prior studies have provided some automatic approaches,
they generate release notes mainly by extracting information from code changes.
This will result in language-specific and not being general enough to be
applicable. Therefore, helping developers produce release notes effectively
remains an unsolved challenge. To address the problem, we first conduct a
manual study on the release notes of 900 GitHub projects, which reveals that
more than 54% of projects produce their release notes with pull requests. Based
on the empirical finding, we propose a deep learning based approach named
DeepRelease (Deep learning based Release notes generator) to generate release
notes according to pull requests. The process of release notes generation in
DeepRelease includes the change entries generation and the change category
(i.e., new features or bug fixes) generation, which are formulated as a text
summarization task and a multi-class classification problem, respectively.
Since DeepRelease fully employs text information from pull requests to
summarize changes and identify the change category, it is language-agnostic and
can be used for projects in any language. We build a dataset with over 46K
release notes and evaluate DeepRelease on the dataset. The experimental results
indicate that DeepRelease outperforms four baselines and can generate release
notes similar to those manually written ones in a fraction of the time.

hateful posts from just sarcasm or offensive language. Many ML solutions for
hate speech detection have been proposed by either changing how features are

works consider only one type of feature extraction and classification
algorithm. This work argues that a combination of multiple feature extraction
techniques and different classification models is needed. We propose a
framework to analyze the relationship between multiple feature extraction and
classification techniques to understand how they complement each other. The
framework is used to select a subset of complementary techniques to compose a
robust multiple classifiers system (MCS) for hate speech detection. The
experimental study considering four hate speech classification datasets
demonstrates that the proposed framework is a promising methodology for
analyzing and designing high-performing MCS for this task. MCS system obtained
using the proposed framework significantly outperforms the combination of all

is a nonlinear function of the aircraft pose and radar position. Current path
planning techniques for this application assume that the aircraft pose is
deterministic. In practice, however, the aircraft pose is estimated using a
navigation filter and therefore contains uncertainty. The uncertainty in the
aircraft pose induces uncertainty in the probability of detection, but this
phenomenon is generally not considered when path planning. This paper provides
a method for combining aircraft pose uncertainty with single-pulse radar

experiments were performed in the past to test for potential terrestrial
organisms as Panspermia seeds, it is uncertain whether such organisms will
likely ""seed"" a new planet even if they are able to survive spaceflight.
Therefore, rather than using organisms, using abiotic chemicals as seeds has
been proposed as part of the molecular Panspermia hypothesis. Here, as an
extension of this hypothesis, we introduce and review the plausibility of a
polymeric material-based Panspermia seed (M-BPS) theoretical concept, where the
type of polymeric material that can function as a M-BPS must be able to: 1)
survive spaceflight, and 2) ""function"", i.e., contingently drive chemical
evolution towards some form of abiogenesis once arriving on a foreign planet.
  We use polymeric gels as a model example of a potential M-BPS. Polymeric gels
that can be prebiotically synthesized on one planet (such as polyester gels)
could be transferred to another planet via meteoritic transfer, where upon
landing on a liquid bearing planet, can assemble into structures containing
cellular-like characteristics and functionalities. Such features presupposed
that these gels can assemble into compartments through phase separation to
accomplish relevant functions such as encapsulation of primitive metabolic,
genetic and catalytic materials, exchange of these materials, motion,
coalescence, and evolution. All of these functions can result in the gels'
capability to alter local geochemical niches on other planets, thereby allowing
chemical evolution to lead to OoL events.

isospin partners in the final states. This advantage allows us to study charge
symmetry breaking in the $\Lambda N$ interaction. We calculate the differential
cross sections of these reactions with stopped kaons theoretically and discuss
the possibility to extract the scattering length and effective range of the
$\Lambda N$ scattering. With stopped kaons, the $\Lambda N$ interaction takes
place dominantly in the spin-triplet state thanks to the deuteron spin and
$s$-wave dominance of the scattering amplitudes at the low energy. We find that
the ratio of the differential cross sections as a function of the $\Lambda N$
invariant mass between the two reactions is useful for revealing how charge
symmetry breaking, or isospin symmetry breaking appears in the low-energy
$\Lambda N$ scattering.

tokens. Hashtags often encode the essence of user-generated posts, along with
information like topic and sentiment, which are useful in downstream tasks.
Hashtags prioritize brevity and are written in unique ways -- transliterating
and mixing languages, spelling variations, creative named entities. Benchmark
datasets used for the hashtag segmentation task -- STAN, BOUN -- are small in
size and extracted from a single set of tweets. However, datasets should
reflect the variations in writing styles of hashtags and also account for
domain and language specificity, failing which the results will misrepresent
model performance. We argue that model performance should be assessed on a
wider variety of hashtags, and datasets should be carefully curated. To this
end, we propose HashSet, a dataset comprising of: a) 1.9k manually annotated
dataset; b) 3.3M loosely supervised dataset. HashSet dataset is sampled from a
different set of tweets when compared to existing datasets and provides an
alternate distribution of hashtags to build and validate hashtag segmentation
models. We show that the performance of SOTA models for Hashtag Segmentation
drops substantially on proposed dataset, indicating that the proposed dataset

spectral and time variation of Sun to barycentre distance, RB, calculated for
both the eight and nine planet systems, with variation of sunspot number (SSN).
Including Planet 9 improves spectral correlation and time coherence between RB

the variation of RB is sensitive to Planet 9 parameters, longitude and period,
it is possible to tune both parameters to SSN variation and obtain new

lithography, where the lithography mask and the wafer are parallelly arranged
through two focusing mirrors. EUV light is injected through an off-axis
rotating mirror at the back focal plane and provides off-axis illumination
(precession beam) to the mask and bounces back twice (at the mask and the
wafer), finally goes out from the resonator through the rotating mirror. This
is a single path cavity, there is no resonant effect. The orbital error or
vibration of the rotating mirror do not affect on the imaging quality. The
off-axis illumination is essential for high-NA optics, which recovers the high
spatial frequency, and improves the edge contrast. The matched annular-aperture
is located at the back-focal plane of the projector mirror, which acts as
Fourier filter passing only the horizontally scattered waves reflected by the
density modulations F(kx,ky,0) : 0-th z-order Fourier component of the mask.
During single precession of the beam, this system creates 2D image of the
normally projected density map of the mask pattern onto the wafer, where the
longitudinal variation (3D effect) disappears, and thus the mask-shadowing
problem is moderated. The depth-of-focus (DOF) is long, and also the image
contrast becomes very high. As the objective mirror, Schwarzschild objective or
Wolter telescope will be a suitable candidate. Wolter telescope is axisymmetric
and lighter than conventional solid concave mirror, therefore, a larger
diameter can be fabricated in high precession. By optimizing Wolter telescope,
it may be possible to cover the wafer field size 26 mm x 33 mm of single
patterning. Example parameter design was performed, seems technically feasible.

lightweight Goroutines to support highly parallelism in user space. Moreover,
Go leverages channels to enable explicit communication among threads. However,
recent studies show that concurrency bugs are not uncommon in Go applications.
Pinpointing these concurrency bugs in real Go applications is both important
and challenging. Existing approaches are mostly based on compiler-aided static

require the availability and recompilation of the source code, which work well
on testing rather than production environments with no source code available

on pure Go code bases only, not programs mixed with Go and other languages. To
address these limitations, we develop BinGo, the first tool to identify

correlates binary execution with Go semantics and employs novel bug detection
algorithms. BinGo is an end-to-end tool that is ready for deployment in the
production environment with no modification on source code, compilers, and
runtimes in the Go eco-system. Our experiments show that BinGo has a high

gradient nonlinearity in the PFC free energy functional that is derived from
classical density functional theory. Their significant impacts on the stability
regimes of ordered phases, phase diagrams, and elastic properties of the
system, as compared to those of the original PFC model, are revealed through
systematic analyses and simulations. The nontrivial contribution from
three-point direct correlation leads to the variation of the critical point of
order-disorder transition to which all the phase boundaries in the
temperature-density phase diagram converge. It also enables the variation and
control of system elastic constants over a substantial range as needed in
modeling different types of materials with the same crystalline structure but

assuming that all data examples to be labeled are drawn from known classes.
However, in real annotation tasks, the unlabeled data usually contains a large
amount of examples from unknown classes, resulting in the failure of most
active learning methods. To tackle this open-set annotation (OSA) problem, we
propose a new active learning framework called LfOSA, which boosts the
classification performance with an effective sampling strategy to precisely
detect examples from known classes for annotation. The LfOSA framework
introduces an auxiliary network to model the per-example max activation value
(MAV) distribution with a Gaussian Mixture Model, which can dynamically select
the examples with highest probability from known classes in the unlabeled set.
Moreover, by reducing the temperature $T$ of the loss function, the detection
model will be further optimized by exploiting both known and unknown
supervision. The experimental results show that the proposed method can
significantly improve the selection quality of known classes, and achieve
higher classification accuracy with lower annotation cost than state-of-the-art
active learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work

measurement of a fluorescent dye molecule in water confined to nanoscale
between two hydrophilic surfaces whose separation can be controlled with a
precision of less than a nm. We observe that the fluorescence intensities
correlate over a fast($\sim$ 30 $\mu$s) and slow ($\sim$ 1000 $\mu$s) time
components. The slow timescale is due to adsorption of fluorophores to the
confining walls and it disappears in presence of 1 M salt. The fast component
is attributed to diffusion of dye molecules in the gap and is found to be
bulk-like for sub-10 nm separations and indicates that viscosity of water under
confinement remains unaltered up to confinement gap as small as $\sim$ 5 nm.

Before the fine-grained sparse regularization of MaskSparity, we can use many
methods to get the pruning mask, such as running the global sparse
regularization. MaskSparsity achieves 63.03%-FLOPs reduction on ResNet-110 by
removing 60.34% of the parameters, with no top-1 accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. On
ILSVRC-2012, MaskSparsity reduces more than 51.07% FLOPs on ResNet-50, with
only a loss of 0.76% in the top-1 accuracy.
  The code is released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/MaskSparsity.
Moreover, we have integrated the code of MaskSparity into a PyTorch pruning
toolkit, EasyPruner, at https://gitee.com/casia_iva_engineer/easypruner.

  MIMO-OFDM Systems with Implicit CSI","Accepted by IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an aerial hybrid massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, how to design a
spectral-efficient broadband multi-user hybrid beamforming with a limited pilot
and feedback overhead is challenging. To this end, by modeling the key
transmission modules as an end-to-end (E2E) neural network, this paper proposes
a data-driven deep learning (DL)-based unified hybrid beamforming framework for
both the time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) systems
with implicit channel state information (CSI). For TDD systems, the proposed
DL-based approach jointly models the uplink pilot combining and downlink hybrid
beamforming modules as an E2E neural network. While for FDD systems, we jointly
model the downlink pilot transmission, uplink CSI feedback, and downlink hybrid
beamforming modules as an E2E neural network. Different from conventional
approaches separately processing different modules, the proposed solution
simultaneously optimizes all modules with the sum rate as the optimization
object. Therefore, by perceiving the inherent property of air-to-ground massive
MIMO-OFDM channel samples, the DL-based E2E neural network can establish the
mapping function from the channel to the beamformer, so that the explicit
channel reconstruction can be avoided with reduced pilot and feedback overhead.
Besides, practical low-resolution phase shifters (PSs) introduce the
quantization constraint, leading to the intractable gradient backpropagation
when training the neural network. To mitigate the performance loss caused by
the phase quantization error, we adopt the transfer learning strategy to
further fine-tune the E2E neural network based on a pre-trained network that
assumes the ideal infinite-resolution PSs. Numerical results show that our
DL-based schemes have considerable advantages over state-of-the-art schemes.

modern healthcare, especially with the latest advances in artificial
intelligence (AI). Electronic health records (EHRs), which contain
heterogeneous patient information, are widely used in disease risk prediction
tasks. One challenge of applying AI models for risk prediction lies in
generating interpretable evidence to support the prediction results while
retaining the prediction ability. In order to address this problem, we propose
the method of jointly embedding words and labels whereby attention modules
learn the weights of words from medical notes according to their relevance to
the names of risk prediction labels. This approach boosts interpretability by
employing an attention mechanism and including the names of prediction tasks in
the model. However, its application is only limited to the handling of textual
inputs such as medical notes. In this paper, we propose a label dependent
attention model LDAM to 1) improve the interpretability by exploiting
Clinical-BERT (a biomedical language model pre-trained on a large clinical
corpus) to encode biomedically meaningful features and labels jointly; 2)
extend the idea of joint embedding to the processing of time-series data, and
develop a multi-modal learning framework for integrating heterogeneous
information from medical notes and time-series health status indicators. To
demonstrate our method, we apply LDAM to the MIMIC-III dataset to predict
different disease risks. We evaluate our method both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Specifically, the predictive power of LDAM will be shown, and
case studies will be carried out to illustrate its interpretability.

current research on facial expression recognition (FER) mainly focuses on basic
expressions, and thus fails to address the diversity of human emotions in
practical scenarios. Meanwhile, existing work on compound FER relies heavily on
abundant labeled compound expression training data, which are often laboriously
collected under the professional instruction of psychology. In this paper, we
study compound FER in the cross-domain few-shot learning setting, where only a
few images of novel classes from the target domain are required as a reference.
In particular, we aim to identify unseen compound expressions with the model
trained on easily accessible basic expression datasets. To alleviate the
problem of limited base classes in our FER task, we propose a novel Emotion
Guided Similarity Network (EGS-Net), consisting of an emotion branch and a
similarity branch, based on a two-stage learning framework. Specifically, in
the first stage, the similarity branch is jointly trained with the emotion
branch in a multi-task fashion. With the regularization of the emotion branch,
we prevent the similarity branch from overfitting to sampled base classes that
are highly overlapped across different episodes. In the second stage, the
emotion branch and the similarity branch play a ""two-student game"" to
alternately learn from each other, thereby further improving the inference
ability of the similarity branch on unseen compound expressions. Experimental
results on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild compound expression datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method against several

are collected from medical providers involved in the patient's care, including
medical notes, clinical events, laboratory test results, symptoms, and
diagnoses. In the field of modern healthcare, predicting whether patients would
experience any risks based on their EHRs has emerged as a promising research
area, in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays a key role. To make AI models
practically applicable, it is required that the prediction results should be
both accurate and interpretable. To achieve this goal, this paper proposed a
label-dependent and event-guided risk prediction model (LERP) to predict the
presence of multiple disease risks by mainly extracting information from
unstructured medical notes. Our model is featured in the following aspects.
First, we adopt a label-dependent mechanism that gives greater attention to
words from medical notes that are semantically similar to the names of risk
labels. Secondly, as the clinical events (e.g., treatments and drugs) can also
indicate the health status of patients, our model utilizes the information from
events and uses them to generate an event-guided representation of medical
notes. Thirdly, both label-dependent and event-guided representations are
integrated to make a robust prediction, in which the interpretability is
enabled by the attention weights over words from medical notes. To demonstrate
the applicability of the proposed method, we apply it to the MIMIC-III dataset,
which contains real-world EHRs collected from hospitals. Our method is
evaluated in both quantitative and qualitative ways.

friction and drivetrain resistance. Also, the power is used to increase the
kinetic and potential energy. Herein, to model a steady ride\, -- \,as expected
for individual timetrials\, -- \,we assume a constant centre-of-mass speed,
while allowing the cadence and power to vary during a lap. Hence, the kinetic
energy is constant and the only mechanical energy whose change we need to
consider is the increase of potential energy due to raising the centre of mass
upon exiting each curve. The effect of dissipative forces is examined at each
point of the lap; the effect of conservative forces is examined as an average.
The latter, albeit not negligible, is a small part of the total power.
Following derivations and justifications of expressions that constitute this
mathematical model, we present a numerical example. We show that the cadence
and power vary only slightly during a steady ride. In other words, a constant
centre-of-mass speed entails nearly constant cadence and power, as expected for
a steady ride. Also, we examine changes in the required power due to changes of
various quantities, such as air density at a velodrome, laptime and several
others, as well as the model sensitivity to input errors. Furthermore, we
examine the effects on required power of slight and gradual changes of speed,
which are pertinent to individual time trials.

with each other via indirect spin-exchange interaction mediated by the helical
edge states, namely the RKKY interaction, which can be measured by the magnetic
correlation between the two spins. By means of the newly developed natural
orbitals renormalization group (NORG) method, we investigated the magnetic
correlation between two Kondo impurities interacting with the helical edge
states, based on the Kane-Mele model defined in a finite zigzag graphene
nanoribbon with spin-orbital coupling (SOC). We find that the SOC effect breaks
the symmetry in spatial distribution of the magnetic correlation, leading to
anisotropy in the RKKY interaction. Specifically, the total correlation is
always ferromagnetic (FM) when the two impurities are located at the same
sublattice, while it is always antiferromagnetic (AFM) when at the different
sublattices. Meanwhile, the behavior of the in-plane correlation is consistent
with that of the total correlation. However, the out-of-plane correlation can
be tuned from FM to AFM by manipulating either the Kondo coupling or the
interimpurity distance. Furthermore, the magnetic correlation is tunable by the
SOC, especially that the out-of-plane correlation can be adjusted from FM to
AFM by increasing the strength of SOC. Dynamic properties of the system,
represented by the spin-staggered excitation spectrum and the spin-staggered
susceptibility at the two impurity sites, are finally explored. It is shown
that the spin-staggered susceptibility is larger when the two impurities are
located at the different sublattices than at the same sublattice, which is
consistent with the behavior of the out-of-plane correlation. On the other
hand, our study further demonstrates that the NORG is an effective numerical
method for studying the quantum impurity systems.

state allows for a common description of all neutron stars. To connect these
observations and infer the properties of dense matter and neutron stars
simultaneously, models for the equation of state are introduced. Parametric
models rely on carefully engineered functional forms that reproduce a large
array of realistic equations of state. Such models benefit from their
simplicity but are limited because any finite-parameter model cannot accurately
approximate all possible equations of state. Nonparametric models overcome this
by increasing model freedom at the cost of increased complexity. In this study,
we compare common parametric and nonparametric models, quantify the limitations
of the former, and study the impact of modeling on our current understanding of
high-density physics. We show that parametric models impose strongly
model-dependent, and sometimes opaque, correlations between density scales.
Such interdensity correlations result in tighter constraints that are
unsupported by data and can lead to biased inference of the equation of state

outside information is required: unless agents can directly observe every

But most accounts of indirect reciprocity take as given a truthful and
misunderstanding-free communication system. In this paper, we seek to explain
how such a communication system could remain evolutionarily stable in the
absence of exogenous pressures. Specifically, we present three conditions that
together allow signaling and (altruistic) cooperation to interact in a way that
maintains both the effectiveness of the signal and the prevalence of

truthful, requiring a vital conceptual slippage between cooperation/defection

can create stability by expressing all information about agents' strategies,
and (3) use a norm that rewards defection against defectors, confirming that
the norms encoded by a communication system determine its stability.

generation because of the long-tailed distribution of training data. To address
this problem, we propose Resistance Training using Prior Bias (RTPB) for the
scene graph generation. Specifically, RTPB uses a distributed-based prior bias
to improve models' detecting ability on less frequent relationships during
training, thus improving the model generalizability on tail categories. In
addition, to further explore the contextual information of objects and
relationships, we design a contextual encoding backbone network, termed as Dual
Transformer (DTrans). We perform extensive experiments on a very popular
benchmark, VG150, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the
unbiased scene graph generation. In specific, our RTPB achieves an improvement
of over 10% under the mean recall when applied to current SGG methods.
Furthermore, DTrans with RTPB outperforms nearly all state-of-the-art methods
with a large margin.

could spatio-temporal stimuli correlations and retinal network dynamics shape
the spike train correlations at the output of the retina ? These questions are
addressed, first, introducing a mathematically tractable model of the layered

rectification, allowing to compute the retinal ganglion cells receptive field
together with the voltage and spike correlations of retinal ganglion cells
resulting from the amacrine cells networks. Then, I review some recent results
showing how the concept of spatio-temporal Gibbs distributions and linear

post-process radiative transfer of AGN radiation through the simulated gaseous
jet-perturbed disc to estimate the extent of photo-ionization by the AGN with
an incident luminosity of $10^{45}~\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. We also map the gas
that is collisionally ionized due to shocks driven by the jet. The analysis was
carried out for simulations with similar jet power
($10^{45}~\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) but different jet orientations with respect to
the gas disc. We find that the shocks from the jets can ionize a significant
fraction (up to 33$\%$) of dense gas ($n>100\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) in the disc,
and that the jets clear out the central regions of gas for AGN radiation to
penetrate to larger distances in the disc. Jets inclined towards the disc plane
couple more strongly with the ISM and ionize a larger fraction of gas in the
disc as compared to the vertical jet. However, similar to previous studies, we
find that the AGN radiation is quickly absorbed by the outer layers of dense
clouds in the disc, and is not able to substantially ionize the disc on a
global scale. Thus, compared to jet-ISM interactions, we expect that
photo-ionization by the AGN radiation only weakly affects the star-formation
activity in the central regions of the galactic disc ($\lesssim 1$ kpc),
although the jet-induced shocks can spread farther out.

paper introduces for the first time the idea of Stimulation Model (SM), as a
mathematical relation between the set of detectable events and the

observations model, and a solution approach based on deep embedded features and

provide a suitable description for data distribution, while an autoencoder is
used to reduce undesired effects due to the so-called curse of dimensionality
emerging in case of large scale networks. Then, it is shown that a SM can be
learnt by solving Maximum A-Posteriori estimation on the encoded features
belonging to a space with lower dimensionality. Numerical results on synthetic
scenarios are reported to validate the devised estimation algorithm.

that aims to maximize the total profit by selecting a subset of items under
given constraints on the total weights. In this study, we analyze a generalized
version of KP, which is termed the generalized multidimensional knapsack
problem (GMDKP). As opposed to the basic KP, GMDKP allows multiple choices per
item type under multiple weight constraints. Although several efficient
algorithms are known and the properties of their solutions have been examined
to a significant extent for basic KPs, there is a paucity of known algorithms

as follows: (1) When the profits of item types are normally distributed, the
total profit grows in the leading order with respect to the number of item
types as the maximum number of choices per item type $x^{\rm max}$ increases
while it depends on $x^{\rm max}$ only in a sub-leading order if the profits
are constant among the item types. (2) A greedy-type heuristic can find a
nearly optimal solution whose total profit is lower than the optimal value only
by a sub-leading order with a low computational cost. (3) The sub-leading
difference from the optimal total profit can be improved by a heuristic
algorithm based on the cavity method. Extensive numerical experiments support
these findings.

either one can produce a more satisfactory fit than the other, depending on the
knot sequence being used and the data being analyzed. Therefore, practitioners
should try out both before betting on either one, for which we have implemented
general P-spline in R packages gps and gps.mgcv. The new general P-spline is
closely related to O'Sullivan spline (or O-spline) through a sandwich formula
that links general difference penalty to derivative penalty. Though both
penalties seem equally powerful in wiggliness control for their mathematical

growth is critical to the long-term prosperity of platform economies. However,
compared with extensive studies on user modeling such as click-through rate

terms of understanding their diverse demands and performance. Different from
user modeling, advertiser modeling generally involves many kinds of tasks (e.g.
predictions of advertisers' expenditure, active-rate, or total impressions of

multiple marketing scenarios (e.g. Sponsored Search, Display Ads, Live

them. This raises the necessity of multi-task and multi-scenario consideration
in comprehensive advertiser modeling, which faces the following challenges:
First, one model per scenario or per task simply doesn't scale; Second, it is
particularly hard to model new or minor scenarios with limited data samples;

it is possible to investigate the formation of CMEs by comparing multi-CMEs
under a homologous physical condition. AR 11283 had been present on the solar
surface for several days when a bipole emerged on 2011 September 4. Its
positive polarity collided with the pre-existing negative polarity belonging to
a different bipole, producing recurrent solar activities along the polarity
inversion line (PIL) between the colliding polarities, namely the so-called
collisional PIL (cPIL). Our results show that a large amount of energy and
helicity were built up in the form of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs), with
recurrent release and accumulation processes. These MFRs were built up along
the cPIL. A flux deficit method is adopted and shows that magnetic cancellation
happens along the cPIL due to the collisional shearing scenario proposed by
Chintzoglou et al. The total amount of canceled flux was
$\sim$0.7$\times$10$^{21}$ Mx with an uncertainty of $\sim$13.2$\%$ within the
confidence region of the 30$^\circ$ sun-center distance. The canceled flux
amounts to 24$\%$ of the total unsigned flux of the bipolar magnetic region.
The results show that the magnetic fields beside the cPIL are very sheared, and
the average shear angle is above 70$^\circ$ after the collision. The fast
expansion of the twist kernels of the MFRs and the continuous eruptive
activities are both driven by the collisional shearing process. These results
are important for better understanding the buildup process of the MFRs
associated with homologous solar eruptions.

networks over shared transmission channels. For a complex network of dynamical
systems, referred to as nodes, a sensor network is adopted to measure and
estimate the system states in a distributed way, where a sensor is used to
measure a node. The estimates are transmitted from sensors to the associated
nodes, in the presence of one-step time delay and subject to packet loss. Due
to limited transmission capability, only a portion of sensors are allowed to
send information at each time step. The goal of this paper is to seek an
optimal sensor scheduling policy minimizing the overall estimation errors.
Under a distributed state estimation framework, this problem is reformulated as
a Markov decision process, where the one-stage reward for each node is strongly
coupled. The feasibility of the problem reformulation is ensured. In addition,
an easy-to-check condition is established to guarantee the existence of an
optimal deterministic and stationary policy. Moreover, it is found that the
optimal policies have a threshold, which can be used to reduce the
computational complexity in obtaining these policies. Finally, the
effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by several simulation

to divide training data into balanced groups based on their similarity. Then,
considering that different shard models do not uniformly contribute to the

and intelligent vehicle platform. At present, the main paradigm is
tracking-by-detection, and the main difficulty of this paradigm is how to
associate current candidate detections with historical tracklets. However, in
the MOT scenarios, each historical tracklet is composed of an object sequence,
while each candidate detection is just a flat image, which lacks temporal
features of the object sequence. The feature difference between current
candidate detections and historical tracklets makes the object association much
harder. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mutual Representation Learning
(STURE) approach which learns spatial-temporal representations between current
candidate detections and historical sequences in a mutual representation space.
For historical trackelets, the detection learning network is forced to match
the representations of sequence learning network in a mutual representation
space. The proposed approach is capable of extracting more distinguishing
detection and sequence representations by using various designed losses in
object association. As a result, spatial-temporal feature is learned mutually
to reinforce the current detection features, and the feature difference can be
relieved. To prove the robustness of the STURE, it is applied to the public MOT
challenge benchmarks and performs well compared with various state-of-the-art
online MOT trackers based on identity-preserving metrics.

distributed hyper-parameter tuning framework. Compared with existing systems,
Hyper-Tune highlights multiple system optimizations, including (1) automatic

optimizer. We conduct extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets and a
large-scale real-world dataset in production. Empirically, with the aid of
these optimizations, Hyper-Tune outperforms competitive hyper-parameter tuning
systems on a wide range of scenarios, including XGBoost, CNN, RNN, and some
architectural hyper-parameters for neural networks. Compared with the
state-of-the-art BOHB and A-BOHB, Hyper-Tune achieves up to 11.2x and 5.1x

Distributed computing is a technique which parallelizes computational tasks,

coordination of these machines, making it rapidly scalable. Carla is a vehicle
simulator that generates data used to train a model. The bulk of the project
was writing the training logic that Ray would use to train my distributed
model. Imitation learning is the best fit for autonomous vehicles. Imitation
learning is an alternative to reinforcement learning and it works by trying to
learn the optimal policy by imitating an expert (usually a human) given a set
of demonstrations. A key deliverable for the project was showcasing my trained
agent in a few benchmark tests, such as navigating a complex turn through
traffic. Beyond that, the broader ambition was to develop a research platform
where others could quickly train and run experiments on huge amounts of Carla

functions can extract the iso-surface of a shape at arbitrary resolution.
However, utilizing the neural network with a large number of parameters as the

this work, we propose TaylorImNet inspired by the Taylor series for implicit 3D

After the expansion points and corresponding coefficients are obtained, our
model only needs to calculate the Taylor series to evaluate each point and the
number of expansion points is independent of the generating resolution. Based
on this representation, our TaylorImNet can achieve a significantly faster
generation speed than other baselines. We evaluate our approach on

coupled FBSDEs, stemming from stochastic control. It is a modification of the
deep BSDE method in which the initial value to the backward equation is not a
free parameter, and with a new loss function being the weighted sum of the cost
of the control problem, and a variance term which coincides with the mean
squared error in the terminal condition. We show by a numerical example that a
direct extension of the classical deep BSDE method to FBSDEs, fails for a
simple linear-quadratic control problem, and motivate why the new method works.
Under regularity and boundedness assumptions on the exact controls of time
continuous and time discrete control problems, we provide an error analysis for
our method. We show empirically that the method converges for three different
problems, one being the one that failed for a direct extension of the deep BSDE
method.

rotational and temperature-dependent vibrational degrees of freedom. The model
reduces to the Boltzmann equation for monatomic gas when the energy exchange
between the translational and internal modes is absent, thus the influence of
intermolecular potential can be captured. Moreover, not only the transport
coefficients but also their fundamental relaxation processes are recovered. The
accuracy of our kinetic model is validated by the direct simulation Monte Carlo
method in several rarefied gas flows, including the shock wave, Fourier flow,
Couette flow, and the creep flow driven by Maxwell's demon. Then the kinetic
model is adopted to investigate thermally-induced flows. By adjusting the
viscosity index in the Boltzmann collision operator, we find that the
intermolecular potential significantly influences the velocity and Knudsen
force. Interestingly, in the transition flow regime, the Knudsen force exerting
on a heated beam could reverse the direction when the viscosity index changes
from 0.5 (hard-sphere gas) to 1 (Maxwell gas). This discovery is useful in the
design of micro-electromechanical systems for microstructure actuation and gas
sensing.

two particles are stable due to an accidental $\mathbb{Z}^{}_4$ symmetry after
the breaking of a $\text{U}(1)^{}_\textsf{D}$ gauge symmetry. By introducing
one extra complex scalar as a mediator between the SIMP particles, this model
can have $3 \to 2$ processes that determine the DM relic density. On the other
hand, the SIMP DM particles can maintain kinetic equilibrium with the thermal
bath until the DM freeze-out temperature via the $\text{U}(1)^{}_\textsf{D}$
gauge couplings. Most importantly, we find an unavoidable two-loop induced $2

redistribute the SIMP DM number densities after the chemical freeze-out of DM.
Moreover, this redistribution would significantly modify the predictions of the

contrastive frameworks by adding a branch for reconstructing raw image pixels
in parallel with the existing contrastive objective. RePre is equipped with a
lightweight convolution-based decoder that fuses the multi-hierarchy features

Zhu \& M\'enard. The use of MgII absorbers represents a new approach to the
investigation of large-scale structures (LSSs) at redshifts $0.45 \lesssim z
\lesssim 2.25$. We present the observational properties of the GA, and we
assess it statistically using methods based on: (i) single-linkage hierarchical
clustering ($\sim 4.5\sigma$); (ii) the Cuzick-Edwards test ($\sim 3.0\sigma$);
and (iii) power spectrum analysis ($\sim 4.8\sigma$). Each of these methods has
distinctive attributes and powers, and we advise considering the evidence from
the ensemble. We discuss our approaches to mitigating any {\it post-hoc}
aspects of analysing significance after discovery. The overdensity of the GA is
$\delta \rho / \rho \sim 1.3 \pm 0.3$. The GA is the newest and one of the
largest of a steadily accumulating set of very large LSSs that may (cautiously)
challenge the Cosmological Principle, upon which the `standard model' of
cosmology is founded. Conceivably, the GA is the precursor of a structure like
the Sloan Great Wall (but the GA is about twice the size), seen when the
Universe was about half its present age.

which integrates the concept of frequent itemset mining in data mining into the
well-known memetic search framework. Starting from a high-quality population
built by the solution construction and population repair procedures, it
iteratively employs the frequent itemset recombination operator (to generate
promising offspring solution based on itemsets that frequently occur in
high-quality solutions), tabu search-based simulated annealing (to find
high-quality local optima), population repair procedure (to modify the
population), and rank-based population management strategy (to guarantee a
healthy population). Extensive evaluations on 50 widely used benchmark
instances show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.
In particular, it discovers 29 new upper bounds and matches 18 previous
best-known bounds. Finally, experimental analyses are performed to confirm the
effectiveness of key algorithmic modules of the proposed method.

Additionally, with increasing strength of the electron-electron correlation an
enhancement of the high-frequency regime of the HHG spectrum is found. This is
attributed to the on-site Coulomb repulsion between electrons giving rise to a
localized quiver motion of the electrons. The finite-lattice enhancement
dominates the HHG spectra from a few harmonic orders until a threshold from

different attention mechanisms. Despite their effectiveness, they still suffer

contextual semantic information, our model reduces information redundancy by
performing graph structure learning. Finally, the fine-grained semantic
representations are fed into the downstream claim-evidence interaction module
for predictions. Comprehensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority of

the significant performance deterioration on benchmarks while using those data

light mass of the charged Higgs boson and the constraints from theory,
electroweak precision data, Higgs data, $b\to s \gamma$, and direct search

predicts somewhat definite phenomenological signatures. We find that the mass
of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson, $M_A$, is the most crucial factor in the
phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson. If $M_A$ is light, the charged Higgs
boson decays mainly into $A W^\pm$. When $M_A$ is above the $A W^\pm$
threshold, the dominant decay mode is into $ \tau^\pm \nu$. Over the whole
viable parameter space, we study all the possible production and decay modes of

nascent field of cosmology, from the static models of Einstein and de Sitter to
the expanding cosmologies of Friedmann and Lemaitre. By the early 1930s, the
first tentative astronomical evidence of cosmic expansion had trigged a
paradigm shift to dynamic cosmologies, almost all of which were couched firmly

combination of their spin, valley, and sublattice polarizations. When the
inversion and time reversal symmetries are broken by the substrate or by strong
interactions, the degeneracy of the flavors can be lifted and their
corresponding bands can be filled sequentially. Due to their non-trivial band
topology and Berry curvature, each of the bands is classified by a topological
Chern number, leading to the quantum anomalous Hall and Chern insulator states
at integer fillings $\nu$ of the bands. It has been recently predicted,
however, that depending on the local atomic-scale arrangements of the graphene
and the encapsulating hBN lattices, rather than being a global topological
invariant, the Chern number C may become position dependent, altering transport
and magnetic properties of the itinerant electrons. Using a SQUID-on-tip, we
directly image the nanoscale Berry-curvature-induced equilibrium orbital
magnetism, the polarity of which is governed by the local Chern number, and
detect its two constituent components associated with the drift and the
self-rotation of the electronic wave packets. At $\nu=1$, we observe local
zero-field valley-polarized Chern insulators forming a mosaic of microscopic
patches of C=-1, 0, or 1, governed by the local sublattice polarization,
consistent with predictions. Upon further filling, we find a first-order phase
transition due to recondensation of electrons from valley K to K', which leads
to irreversible flips of the local Chern number and the magnetization, and to
the formation of valley domain walls giving rise to hysteretic global anomalous
Hall resistance. The findings shed new light on the structure and dynamics of
topological phases and call for exploration of the controllable formation of
flavor domain walls and their utilization in twistronic devices.

(MD) simulation is an efficient technique to reveal atomistic features of phase
transition, but its application is often limited by the accuracy of empirical

accuracy, capable of performing efficient MD simulations and accurate property

ferroelectric distortion and antiferrodistortion, and the ferroelectric phase
transition has both displacive and order-disorder characters. This works lays

their ensembles in a mesoscopic size range from 1 to a few hundred nanometers

expansion coefficients. MOF-74, a material envisioned for many applications
does not display such a behavior. For this system, temperature-dependent x-ray

perpendicular and positive ones parallel to the hexagonally arranged pores. The
observed trends are explained by combining state-of-the-art density-functional
theory calculations with the Gr\""uneisen theory of thermal expansion, which
allows tracing back thermal expansion to contributions of individual phonons.
On the macroscopic level, the small thermal expansion coefficients arise from
two aspects: compensation effects caused by the large coupling between stress
and strain perpendicular to the pores and the small magnitudes of the mean
Gr\""uneisen tensor elements, $\langle\gamma\rangle$, which provide information
on how strains in the material influence its phonon frequencies. To understand
the small mean Gr\""uneisen tensor in MOF-74, the individual mode contributions
are analyzed based on the corresponding atomic motions. This reveals that only
the lowest frequency modes up to ~3 THz provide non-negligible contributions,
such that $\langle\gamma\rangle$ drops sharply at higher temperatures. These
considerations reveal how the details of the anharmonic properties of specific
phonon bands determine the magnitude and sign of thermal expansion in a

universal ratio $U_{\text{RD}}$ of the radius of gyration $R_g$ to the

performed within a 6m x 6m wide and 12m high cloud portion, which was
hypothesized to be located close to an interface between the warm cloud and

[-4.2; -20.8]. A sufficiently intense stratification was observed to change the
mixing dynamics. The formation of a sub-layer inside the shearless layer was
observed. The sub-layer, under a stable thermal stratification condition,
behaved like a pit of kinetic energy. On the other hand, it was observed that
kinetic energy transient growth took place under unstable conditions, which led
to the formation of an energy peak just below the center of the shearless
layer. The scaling law of the energy time variation inside the interface region
was quantified: this is an algebraic law with an exponent that depends on the
perturbation stratification intensity. The presence of an unstable
stratification increased the differences in statistical behavior among the
longitudinal velocity derivatives, compared with the unstratified case. Since
the mixing process is suppressed in stable cases, small-scale anisotropy is

antiferromagnetic correlation could be enhanced by electronic interaction,
there is no evidence for long-range antiferromagnetic order exhibited in

that the pure electron correlation may not account for the charge density wave

further boosted in the ultracold regime by replacing the working qubit with a

the reservoir qubits which are quantum correlated with the control-target

control between thermalising a working system with one of N identical
thermalising channels (where causal indefiniteness plays no role) yield same
advantages in controlled-SWAPs scheme compared to the generalised N-SWITCH

experimental simulatable quantum cooling protocol with coherently-controlled
thermalising channels and notice that it can outperform ICO refrigerator with
some specific implementations of the thermalising channel in the case when we
only have access to the control-target system. These 2 quantum cooling

range of x-ray energies (from about 5 to 100 keV) which enable to identify
fine-structure resolved Lyman, Balmer as well as Paschen x-ray lines along with
the RR transitions into the K-, L and M-shell of the ions. To compare with
theory, an elaborate theoretical model has been applied. By considering the
relativistic atomic structure of Pb$^{81+}$, this model is based on a
sophisticated computation of the initial population distribution via RR for all
atomic levels up to Rydberg states with principal quantum number $n=$ 165 in
combination with cascade calculations based on time-dependent rate equations.

parameters with time resolved measurements of in vitro populations of liver
cancer cells. The calibration results of both models are compared and the
quality of fit is quantified. While predictions of both models show good

century ago. With the current interest in heat and spin currents in amorphous
magnets, we apply modern simulation methods, combining reverse Monte Carlo to
build the atomic structure and the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation for spin
dynamics, to re-investigate the magnetic excitation spectrum. We find two
magnon valleys, one at the origin and another at a finite wavenumber close to
the observations, but without a magnon gap. We conclude that the second dip is
due to Umklapp scattering caused by residual long-range order, which may be an
alternative explanation of the putative roton excitation. Our study paves the

algorithms, allowing for a quadratic speedup in various applications like those
involving estimating statistics of various functions as in financial Monte
Carlo simulations. Much work has gone into devising methods to efficiently
estimate the amplitude of a quantum state without expensive operations like the
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which is especially prohibitive given the
constraints of current NISQ devices. Newer methods have reduced the number of
operations required on a quantum computer and are the most promising near-term
implementations of the AE subroutine. While it remains to be seen the exact
circuit requirements for a quantum advantage in applications relying on AE, it
is necessary to continue to benchmark the algorithm's performance on current
quantum computers and the circuit costs associated with such subroutines.
  Given these considerations, we expand on results from previous experiments in
using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to approximate the amplitude of a
quantum state and provide empirical upper bounds on the current feasible
circuit depths for AE on a superconducting quantum computer. Our results show
that MLE using optimally-compiled circuits can currently outperform naive
sampling for up to 3 Grover Iterations with a circuit depth of 131, which is
higher than reported in other experimental results. This functional benchmark
is one of many that will be continually monitored against current quantum

Major applications over public clouds require world-wide distribution and large

world-wide inter-region networking infrastructure that can support high
performance communication into, out of, and across public cloud geographic
regions. In this paper, we lay the foundation for a comprehensive study and
real time monitoring of various characteristic of networking within and between
public clouds. We start by presenting CloudCast, a world-wide and expandable
measurements and analysis system, currently (January 2019)collecting data from
three major public clouds (AWS, GCPand Azure), 59 regions, 1184 intra-cloud and
2238 cross-cloud links (each link represents a direct connection between a pair
of regions), amounting to a total of 3422 continuously monitored links and
providing active measurements every minute.CloudCast is composed of measurement
agents automatically installed in each public cloud region, centralized
control, measurement data base, analysis engine and visualization tools. Then
we turn to analyze the latency measurement data collected over almost a year .
Our analysis yields surprising results. First, each public cloud exhibits a
unique set of link latency behaviors along time. Second, using a novel, fair
evaluation methodology, termed similar links, we compare the three clouds.
Third, we prove that more than 50% of all links do not provide the optimal RTT
through the methodology of triangles. Triangles also provide a framework to get
around bottlenecks, benefiting not only the majority (53%-70%) of the

internal combustion engine (ICE) using a 1D convolutional neural network
trained on in-cylinder pressure data. The model architecture was based on
considerations regarding the expected frequency characteristics of knocking
combustion. To aid the feature extraction, all cycles were reduced to 60{\deg}
CA long windows, with no further processing applied to the pressure traces. The
neural networks were trained exclusively on in-cylinder pressure traces from
multiple conditions and labels provided by human experts. The best-performing
model architecture achieves an accuracy of above 92% on all test sets in a
tenfold cross-validation when distinguishing between knocking and non-knocking
cycles. In a multi-class problem where each cycle was labeled by the number of
experts who rated it as knocking, 78% of cycles were labeled perfectly, while
90% of cycles were classified at most one class from ground truth. They thus
considerably outperform the broadly applied MAPO (Maximum Amplitude of Pressure
Oscillation) detection method, as well as other references reconstructed from
previous works. Our analysis indicates that the neural network learned
physically meaningful features connected to engine-characteristic resonance
frequencies, thus verifying the intended theory-guided data science approach.
Deeper performance investigation further shows remarkable generalization
ability to unseen operating points. In addition, the model proved to classify
knocking cycles in unseen engines with increased accuracy of 89% after adapting
to their features via training on a small number of exclusively non-knocking
cycles. The algorithm takes below 1 ms (on CPU) to classify individual cycles,
effectively making it suitable for real-time engine control.

however has the drawback of grouping distributions in a single cluster when
ties are observed across samples. With the goal of achieving a flexible and
effective clustering method for both samples and observations, we investigate a
nonparametric prior that arises as the composition of two different discrete
random structures and derive a closed-form expression for the induced
distribution of the random partition, the fundamental tool regulating the
clustering behavior of the model. On the one hand, this allows to gain a deeper
insight into the theoretical properties of the model and, on the other hand, it
yields an MCMC algorithm for evaluating Bayesian inferences of interest.
Moreover, we single out limitations of this algorithm when working with more
than two populations and, consequently, devise an alternative more efficient
sampling scheme, which as a by-product, allows testing homogeneity between
different populations. Finally, we perform a comparison with the nested
Dirichlet process and provide illustrative examples of both synthetic and real

we obtain an exact characterization of information rate of ACO-OFDM with
improved receivers for all SNRs. It is proved that the high-SNR gain of
improved receivers asymptotically achieve 1/4 bits per channel use, which is
equivalent to 3 dB in electrical SNR or 1.5 dB in optical SNR; as the SNR
decreases, the maximum achievable SNR gain of improved receivers decreases
monotonically to a non-zero low-SNR limit, corresponding to an information rate
gain of 36.3%. For practically used constellations, we derive an upper bound on
the gain of improved receivers. Numerical results demonstrate that the upper
bound can be approached to within 1 dB in optical SNR by combining existing
improved receivers and coded modulation. We also show that our information

that, for the considered schemes, improved receivers may reduce the gap to

well-known effects. They occur when the set of optimal parameters that
determine the quantum correlation consists of isolated points and optimal
parameters during the evolution of the system jump from one such point to
another (e.g., the optimal measurement angle of the quantum discord changes
discontinuously from zero to $\pi/2$ or vice versa). However, when considering
more general X quantum states, we found that quantum discord and one-way
quantum work deficit can experience sudden changes of other kinds. Namely, the
optimal measurement angle may suddenly start to shift {\em continuously} from
its stationary value 0 or $\pi/2$ to an intermediate optimal measurement angle
$\vartheta\in(0,\pi/2)$. This leads to a new behavior of quantum correlations,
which is mathematically described by the Landau phenomenological theory of
second-order phase transitions. In addition, for the one-way quantum work
deficit, we found cases where the optimal measurement angle jumps from zero to
a nonzero step less than $\pi/2$, and then continuously changes its value. This
behavior of quantum correlation is similar to a first-order phase transition in
Landau's theory. Dependencies of quantum discord and one-way quantum work
deficit near the boundaries, which separate regions with state-dependent
(variable) and state-independent (stationary, constant) optimal measurement
angles, are examined in detail on an example of the XXZ spin model in an

""runaway inflation"" (i.e. planet inflation becomes unstable and out of control
when tidal heating rate is above its critical value). With sufficiently strong
tidal heating, luminosity initially increases with inflation, but across its
peak it decreases with inflation such that heating is stronger than cooling and
runaway inflation occurs. In this mechanism, the opacity near
radiative-convective boundary (RCB) scales approximately as temperature to the
fourth power and heat cannot efficiently radiate away from planet interior,
which induces runaway inflation (similar to a tight lid on a boiling pot).
Based on this mechanism, we find that radii of hot Jupiters cannot exceed

performance at various perturbation strengths, we demonstrate the beneficial
effect of using ensembles of OOD detectors, and the use of the

  Image Datasets","5 Pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. The
availability of a robust automated cervical image classification system can
augment the clinical care provider's limitation in traditional visual
inspection with acetic acid (VIA). However, there are a wide variety of
cervical inspection objectives which impact the labeling criteria for
criteria-specific prediction model development. Moreover, due to the lack of
confirmatory test results and inter-rater labeling variation, many images are
left unlabeled.
  Motivated by these challenges, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL)
based approach to produce a pre-trained cervix model from unlabeled cervical
images. The developed model is further fine-tuned to produce criteria-specific
classification models with the available labeled images. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach using two cervical image datasets. Both
datasets are partially labeled and labeling criteria are different. The
experimental results show that the SSL-based initialization improves
classification performance (Accuracy: 2.5% min) and the inclusion of images
from both datasets during SSL further improves the performance (Accuracy: 1.5%
min). Further, considering data-sharing restrictions, we experimented with the
effectiveness of Federated SSL and find that it can improve performance over
the SSL model developed with just its images. This justifies the importance of
SSL-based cervix model development. We believe that the present research shows
a novel direction in developing criteria-specific custom deep models for
cervical image classification by combining images from different sources
unlabeled and/or labeled with varying criteria, and addressing image access
restrictions.

Since DEIM requires singular vectors as input matrices, L-DEIM is particularly
attractive for example in big data problems when computing a rank-$k$-SVD
approximation is expensive even for moderately small $k$ since it uses a
lower-rank SVD approximation instead of the full rank-$k$ SVD. We empirically
demonstrate the performance of L-DEIM, which despite its efficiency, may

We present a novel, target-enclosing, full-waveform inversion framework based

using data from a closed boundary around the target area of interest. Because
such equivalence is violated when the knowledge of the enclosed medium is
incorrect, we propose to minimize the mismatch between the wavefields
independently reconstructed by the two representation formulas. The proposed
method requires only kinematic knowledge of the subsurface model, specifically
the overburden for redatuming, and does not require prior knowledge of the
model below the target area. In this sense it is truly local: sensitive only to
the medium parameters within the chosen target, with no assumptions about the
medium or scattering regime outside the target. We present the theoretical
framework and derive the gradient of the new objective function via the
adjoint-state method and apply it to a synthetic example with exactly redatumed

polyhedral sections of face centered (fcc) and body centered (bcc) cubic
lattices, which are confined by facets characterized by highly dense {100},
{110}, and {111} monolayers. Together with the constraint that the NPs exhibit
the same point symmetry as the ideal cubic lattice, i.e. Oh, different types of
generic NPs serve for the definition of general compact polyhedral cubic NPs.
Their structural properties, such as shape, size, and surface facets, can be
described by only three integer valued polyhedral NP parameters N, M, K.
Corresponding analytical details are discussed with visualization of
characteristic examples. While the overall NP shapes are quite similar between
the different cubic lattice types, structural fine details differ. In
particular, monolayer planes of adjacent NP facets can join at corners and
edges which are not occupied by atoms of the ideal lattice. This gives rise to
microfacets and narrow facet strips depending on the lattice type. The
discussion illustrates the complexity of seemingly simple nanoparticles in a
quantitative account. The geometric relationships of the model particles can
also be used to classify shapes and estimate sizes of real compact metal
nanoparticles observed by experiment.

Its photometric variability is mainly due to pulsations in high-order g modes.
Besides, we detected a weak H$\alpha$ emission. Thus, the second source of
variability is the fluctuation in a disk around the star. The pulsational
spectrum of KIC8264293 reveals a frequency grouping and period spacing pattern.
Here, we present the thorough seismic analysis of the star based on these
features. Taking into account the position of the star in the HR diagram and
fitting the 14 frequencies that form the period spacing we constrain the
internal structure of the star. We conclude that the star barely left the ZAMS
and the best seismic model has $M = 3.54\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$,
$V_\mathrm{rot}=248\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ and $Z = 0.0112$. We found the upper
limit on the mixing at the edge of the convective core, with the overshooting
parameter up to $f_\mathrm{ov} = 0.03$. On the other hand, we were not able to
constrain the envelope mixing for the star. To excite the modes in the observed
frequency range, we had to modify the opacity data. Our best seismic model with
an opacity increase by 100% at the ""nickel"" bump $\log T=5.46$ explains the
whole instability. KIC8264293 is the unique, very young star pulsating in
high-order g modes with the Be feature. However, it is not obvious whether the
source of this circumstellar matter is the ejection of mass from the underlying

benchmark datasets relevant to the clinical domain.
  To address these issues, we curated and released a comprehensive catalogue of

biomedical natural language processing (NLP), based on a systematic review of
literature and online resources. A total of 450 NLP datasets were manually
systematized and annotated with rich metadata, such as targeted tasks, clinical

  Our analysis indicates that AI benchmarks of direct clinical relevance are
scarce and fail to cover most work activities that clinicians want to see
addressed. In particular, tasks associated with routine documentation and
patient data administration workflows are not represented despite significant
associated workloads. Thus, currently available AI benchmarks are improperly
aligned with desired targets for AI automation in clinical settings, and novel

wireless networks. It addresses how to choose an item among multiple scheduling
items in each timestep to achieve a long-term goal. Conventional approaches for
dynamic scheduling find the optimal policy for a given specific system so that
the policy from these approaches is usable only for the corresponding system
characteristics. Hence, it is hard to use such approaches for a practical
system in which system characteristics dynamically change. This paper proposes
a novel policy structure for MDP-based dynamic scheduling, a descriptive
policy, which has a system-agnostic capability to adapt to unseen system
characteristics for an identical task (dynamic scheduling). To this end, the
descriptive policy learns a system-agnostic scheduling principle--in a
nutshell, ""which condition of items should have a higher priority in
scheduling"". The scheduling principle can be applied to any system so that the
descriptive policy learned in one system can be used for another system.
Experiments with simple explanatory and realistic application scenarios
demonstrate that it enables system-agnostic meta-learning with very little
performance degradation compared with the system-specific conventional
policies.

to existing private RL algorithms that work only on tabular finite-state,

notion of joint differential privacy (JDP), where the RL agent is responsible
for protecting users' sensitive data. We design two private RL algorithms that
are based on value iteration and policy optimization, respectively, and show
that they enjoy sub-linear regret performance while guaranteeing privacy
protection. Moreover, the regret bounds are independent of the number of

the algorithms suitable for privacy protection in nowadays large-scale

generalizes previous results for non-private learning, but also serves as a

powerful theoretical tool to study how mobility influences the spread of
communicable diseases. Nevertheless, many metapopulation approaches use
indistinguishable agents to alleviate analytical difficulties. Here, we address
the impact that recurrent mobility patterns, and the spatial distribution of
distinguishable agents, have on the unfolding of epidemics in large urban
areas. We incorporate the distinguishable nature of agents regarding both,
their residence, and their usual destination. The proposed model allows both a
fast computation of the spatio-temporal pattern of the epidemic trajectory and.
the analytical calculation of the epidemic threshold. This threshold is found
as the spectral radius of a mixing matrix encapsulating the residential
distribution, and the specific commuting patterns of agents. We prove that the
simplification of indistinguishable individuals overestimates the value of the
epidemic threshold.

Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to sample the parameter space of
these models and provide estimates of the posterior distributions for these
systems. An initial run using binned light curve data was performed to identify
general parameter trends and provide initializing distributions for a
subsequent analysis incorporating the full data set. We present theoretical
models for all three binaries, along with posterior distributions from our MCMC

  Conference on Communications (ICC) 2022. Copyright @ IEEE",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The recently proposed open-radio access network (O-RAN) architecture embraces
cloudification and network function virtualization techniques to perform the

full, where mobile network operators (MNOs) could install their own RUs, but
then lease on-demand computational resources for the processing of DU and CU
functions from commonly available open-cloud (O-Cloud) servers via open x-haul
interfaces due to variation of load over the day. This creates a multi-tenant
scenario where multiple MNOs share networking as well as computational
resources. In this paper, we propose a framework that dynamically allocates
x-haul and DU/CU resources in a multi-tenant O-RAN ecosystem with min-max
fairness guarantees. This framework ensures that a maximum number of RUs get
sufficient resources while minimizing the OPEX for their MNOs. Moreover, in
order to provide an access network architecture capable of sustaining
low-latency and high capacity between RUs and edge-computing devices, we
consider time-wavelength division multiplexed (TWDM) passive optical network
(PON)-based x-haul interfaces where the PON virtualization technique is used to
provide a direct optical connection between end-points. This creates a virtual
mesh interconnection among all the nodes such that the RUs can be connected to
the Edge-Clouds at macro-cell RU locations as well as to the O-Cloud servers at
the central office locations. Furthermore, we analyze the system performance
with our proposed framework and show that MNOs can operate with a better
cost-efficiency than baseline greedy resource allocation with uniform

exhibiting Meissner effect in weak external magnetic fields. Stronger fields
stress the superconducting state, turning it first into an Abrikosov lattice of

clusters, which are calculated by the strong disorder renormalization method.
We consider the so called energy cluster, which has the smallest excitation
energy and calculate its mass and linear extension in one-, two- and
three-dimensions. Both average quantities are found to grow logarithmically
with the linear size of the sample. Consequently, the rare regions are not
compact: for the diluted model they are isotropic and tree-like, while for the
random model they are quasi-one-dimensional.

as a minimal toy model of unresolved irreducible uncertainty in a system
performing inference through a hierarchical model. Threshold potentials adapt
slowly to ensure sensitivity without being wasteful. Activity and energy are
released as intermittent avalanches of pulses with a discrete scaling
distribution largely independent of the exogenous input form. Subthreshold
activities and threshold potentials exhibit Lorentzian temporal spectra, with a
power-law range determined by position in the chain. Subthreshold bistability
closely resembles empirical measurements of intracellular membrane potential.
We suggest that critical cortical cascades emerge from a trade-off between
metabolic power consumption and performance requirements in a critical world,
and that the temporal scaling patterns of brain electrophysiological recordings
ensue from weighted linear combinations of subthreshold activities and pulses
from different hierarchy levels.

monolith architecture is used as an intermediate step. The impact on the
migration effort and on performance is measured for both steps. Current state

already significant in the migration to a modular monolith. Therefore, a clear
distinction is established for each one of the steps, which may inform software

provide minimal insight into the inner logic behind their predictions. This is
a major drawback as the explainability of prediction is vital for applications

explainable machine learning pipeline for breast cancer diagnosis based on
ultrasound images. We extract first- and second-order texture features of the
ultrasound images and use them to build a probabilistic ensemble of decision
tree classifiers. Each decision tree learns to classify the input ultrasound
image by learning a set of robust decision thresholds for texture features of
the image. The decision path of the model predictions can then be interpreted

carcinoma, diagnosed by microscopic study of biopsy slides. However, manual
microscopic evaluation is a subjective and time-consuming process. Many
researchers have reported methods to automate carcinoma detection and
classification. The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the
automation of carcinoma diagnosis also reveals a significant rise in the use of

comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art approaches reported in carcinoma
diagnosis using histopathological images. Studies are selected from well-known

highlighted critical challenges and limitations, and provided insights on
future research direction in automated carcinoma diagnosis. Out of 101 articles
selected, most of the studies experimented on private datasets with varied
image sizes, obtaining accuracy between 63% and 100%. Overall, this review

light absorption towards the red, in comparison to pristine TNTs, prompting
them for a more efficient use of light in photocatalysis by widening the TNTs

the TNTs and the C-dots that form tails of states. The as-synthesized

rapid development of additive manufacturing. The numerical homogenization
method has been well studied for analyzing mechanical behaviors of

computing or applications requiring high-frequency calling, e.g., topology
optimization. Data-driven homogenization methods emerge as a more efficient
choice but limit the microstructures into a cubic shape, which are infeasible
to the periodic microstructures with a more general shape, e.g.,
parallelepiped. This paper introduces a fine-designed 3D convolutional neural
network (CNN) for fast homogenization of parallel-shaped microstructures, named
PH-Net. Superior to existing data-driven methods, PH-Net predicts the local
displacements of microstructures under specified macroscope strains instead of
direct homogeneous material, motivating us to present a label-free loss
function based on minimal potential energy. For dataset construction, we
introduce a shape-material transformation and voxel-material tensor to encode
microstructure type,base material and boundary shape together as the input of
PH-Net, such that it is CNN-friendly and enhances PH-Net on generalization in
terms of microstructure type, base material, and boundary shape. PH-Net
predicts homogenized properties with hundreds of acceleration compared to the
numerical homogenization method and even supports online computing. Moreover,
it does not require a labeled dataset and thus is much faster than current deep
learning methods in training processing. Benefiting from predicting local
displacement, PH-Net provides both homogeneous material properties and
microscopic mechanical properties, e.g., strain and stress distribution, yield
strength, etc. We design a group of physical experiments and verify the
prediction accuracy of PH-Net.

devices was investigated towards its effects on the electrical properties. When
this external electrolyte film is in contact with any top permeable electrode
it produces a self-biasing effect and changes the charge carriers injection
properties. The outer-layer promoted situations where the output current
increases up to two orders of magnitude and others where the output current
decreases one order of magnitude in comparison to the same samples without it.
Admittance spectroscopy measurements were made and the proposed equivalent
circuit model indicates that the interfacial electrical properties dominate
charge injection face to the bulk properties when the outer-layer is present.
All the changes observed here are reversible after the ion gel is detached and
replaced, indicating that ions do not diffuse into the active layer. The
observed results can contribute to improve the current density in certain
sandwich structures as well as notify that electrolyte external films can
behave as an active layer promoting electrical changes into sandwich devices
and can be extended to cases where the electrolyte film is used as substrate.

  Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator","16 pages, Latex, No Figures",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We perform the BFV-BRST quantization of the fourth-order Pais-Uhlenbeck
oscillator (PUO). We show that although the PUO is not naturally constrained in
the sense of Dirac-Bergmann, it is possible to profit from the introduction of
suitable constraints in phase space in order to obtain a proper BRST invariant
quantum system. Starting from its second-class constrained system description,
we use the BFFT conversional approach to obtain first-class constraints as
gauge symmetry generators. After the Abelianization of the constraints, we
obtain the conserved BRST charge, the corresponding BRST transformations and
proceed further to the BFV functional quantization of the model. We show that
different possible gauge choices can be connected by finite field-dependent
BRST transformations.

  decorated 3D Printed nanogenerator",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The 3D printing technology offers an innovative approach for developing
energy storage devices to create facile and low-cost customized electrodes for
modern electronics. Generating electric potential by moving a droplet of ionic
solution over two-dimensional (2D) materials is a novel method for rain energy
harvesting. This work demonstrated a liquid-solid contact electrification-based
3D printed nanogenerator where raindrop passes through the positively charged
ultrathin Gadolinium Telluride (Gd2Te3) sheets. Experimental results showed
that voltage as high as ~0.6 V could be generated by moving a droplet of ionic
solution on the decorated 3D printed nanogenerator. The output efficiency of
the nanogenerator is increased ~400% by enhancing the surface area of copious
3D printed porous structures. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are
done, revealing that the high electrical conductivity of (112) surface of
Gd2Te3 is due to the p-type charge carriers. Additionally, we illustrate the
enhancement of the output performance (~0.8V) by using a graphite rod and
arbitrarily manipulating the surface charge. Therefore, this work can open up a
new avenue to advance scientific research of Blue energy harvesting and tackle
the energy crisis.

  of FDM printed parts: An experimental modal analysis approach",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely explored additive
manufacturing method that uses thermoplastic materials to manufacture products.
Mechanical properties of parts manufactured using FDM are influenced by
different process parameters involved during manufacturing as they impact the
bonding among different layers of cross-section. In this study, the effect of
infill patterns and build orientations on the mechanical properties of PLA
based parts manufactured using FDM method is studied. Six different infill
patterns (triangles, cubic, concentric, tetrahedral, lines, and zigzag) and
three different orientations (flatwise, edgewise, and upright) are considered
for rectangular beam type parts. For determining mechanical properties of parts
with different infill patterns and orientations, flexural bending test is
performed. Experimental modal analysis of manufactured parts is performed to
observe the relation of natural frequencies with elastic modulus of the parts
obtained from flexural bending test. The possibility of experimental modal
analysis as an alternative non-destructive method for testing mechanical
properties of FDM 3D printed parts is explored.

wave-guide and double silicon-on-insulator (SOI) slot micro-ring resonators.
The all-optical sensors do not suffer from electromagnetic interference. We
choose to integrate a silicon slot double micro-ring (SDMR) resonators in an
acoustically resonant membrane. Optimization of the several key structural
parameters is investigated to achieve the mode-field distributions of
transmission spectrum based on Comsol Multiphysics software. Our numerical
studies show that the proposed ultrasonic sensor offers higher sensitivity and
a larger detection frequency range than conventional piezoelectric based
ultrasound transducer. For a SDMR system with an area of 15um*30um, sensitivity
as high as 2453.7mv/kpa, and over a bandwidth range of 1-150MHz. The
sensitivity value is 36 times higher than that of single slot micro-ring
ultrasonic sensor. The theoretical-factor of the SDMR can be approximately
1.24*10^6 with bending radius of 5um. The investigation on the SDMR system is a
valuable exploration of the photo-acoustic microscopy for the ultra-high Q
factor and large frequency range.
