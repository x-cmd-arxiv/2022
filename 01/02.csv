  Coronal Loops","21 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1088/1674-4527/ac47ac",,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Here, we study the temperature structure of flaring and non-flaring coronal
loops, using extracted loops from images taken in six extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
channels recorded by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)/ Solar Dynamic
Observatory (SDO). We use data for loops of X2.1-class-flaring active region
(AR11283) during 22:10UT till 23:00UT, on 2011, September 6; and non-flaring
active region (AR12194) during 08:00:00UT till 09:00:00UT on 2014, October 26.
By using spatially-synthesized Gaussian DEM forward-fitting method, we
calculate the peak temperatures for each strip of the loops. We apply the
Lomb-Scargle method to compute the oscillations periods for the temperature
series of each strip. The periods of the temperature oscillations for the
flaring loops are ranged from 7 min to 28.4 min. These temperature oscillations
show very close behavior to the slow-mode oscillation. We observe that the
temperature oscillations in the flaring loops are started at least around 10
minutes before the transverse oscillations and continue for a long time
duration even after the transverse oscillations are ended. The temperature
amplitudes are increased at the flaring time (during 20 min) in the flaring
loops. The periods of the temperatures obtained for the non-flaring loops are
ranged from 8.5 min to 30 min, but their significances are less (below 0.5) in
comparison with the flaring ones (near to one). Hence the detected temperature
periods for the non-flaring loops' strips are less probable in comparison with
the flaring ones, and maybe they are just fluctuations.
  Based on our confined observations, it seems that the flaring loops' periods
show more diversity and their temperatures have wider ranges of variation than
the non-flaring ones. More accurate commentary in this respect requires more
extensive statistical research and broader observations.

  $\phi_k(n)$",,,,,"math.NT math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In his 1984 Memoir of the American Mathematical Society, George Andrews
defined two families of functions, $\phi_k(n)$ and $c\phi_k(n),$ which
enumerate two types of combinatorial objects which Andrews called generalized
Frobenius partitions. As part of that Memoir, Andrews proved a number of
Ramanujan--like congruences satisfied by specific functions within these two
families. In the years that followed, numerous other authors proved similar
results for these functions, often with a view towards a specific choice of the
parameter $k.$ In this brief note, our goal is to identify an {\bf infinite}
family of values of $k$ such that $\phi_k(n)$ is even for all $n$ in a specific
arithmetic progression; in particular, our primary goal in this work is to
prove that, for all positive integers $\ell,$ all primes $p\geq 5,$ and all
values $r,$ $0 < r < p,$ such that $24r+1$ is a quadratic nonresidue modulo
$p,$
  $$
  \phi_{p\ell-1}(pn+r) \equiv 0 \pmod{2}
  $$ for all $n\geq 0.$
  Our proof of this result is truly elementary, relying on a lemma from
Andrews' Memoir, classical $q$--series results, and elementary generating
function manipulations. Such a result, which holds for infinitely many values
of $k,$ is rare in the study of arithmetic properties satisfied by generalized
Frobenius partitions, primarily because of the unwieldy nature of the
generating functions in question.

nonparametric estimation of Lipschitz operators using deep neural networks.
Non-asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the generalization error of the
empirical risk minimizer over a properly chosen network class. Under the
assumption that the target operator exhibits a low dimensional structure, our
error bounds decay as the training sample size increases, with an attractive
fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension in our estimation. Our
assumptions cover most scenarios in real applications and our results give rise
to fast rates by exploiting low dimensional structures of data in operator
estimation. We also investigate the influence of network structures (e.g.,
network width, depth, and sparsity) on the generalization error of the neural
network estimator and propose a general suggestion on the choice of network
structures to maximize the learning efficiency quantitatively.

function evaluations. The key idea here is to leverage low-fidelity samples
whose responses can be computed with a cost of a certain fraction of that for
high-fidelity samples, in an optimized configuration to reduce the total
computational cost. To accomplish this goal, we employ a multi-fidelity
Gaussian process as the surrogate model of the ItR function, and develop a new
acquisition based on which the optimized next sample can be selected in terms
of its location in the sample space and the fidelity level. In addition, we
develop an inexpensive analytical evaluation of the acquisition and its
derivative, avoiding numerical integrations that are prohibitive for
high-dimensional problems. The new method is tested in a bi-fidelity context
for a series of synthetic problems with varying dimensions, low-fidelity model
accuracy and computational costs. Comparing with the single-fidelity method and
the bi-fidelity method with a pre-defined fidelity hierarchy, our method
consistently shows the best (or among the best) performance for all the test
cases. Finally, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in solving an
engineering problem of estimating the extreme ship motion statistics in
irregular waves, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with two different
grid resolutions as the high and low fidelity models.

Therefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs

limited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To
mitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy

or eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate
the issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to
regularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better
train GNNs. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.RO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increasing interests in recent years
due to its tremendous success in various applications. However, standard RL
algorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to
an unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general
operator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly
approximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The
benefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward
function as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot
manner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of
novel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical
properties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and
the standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the
benefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including
reward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring
for offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.

a text mining approach to identify social reaction patterns and opinion change
over time. Our descriptive analysis identified an irregularity of the users'

agent of the current global COVID-19 pandemic, in which millions of lives have
been lost. Understanding the zoonotic evolution of the coronavirus may provide
insights for developing effective vaccines, monitoring the transmission trends,
and preventing new zoonotic infections. Homopolymeric nucleotide repeats (HP),
the most simple tandem repeats, are a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic genomes.
Yet the HP distributions and roles in coronavirus genome evolution are poorly
investigated. In this study, we characterize the HP distributions and trends in
the genomes of bat and human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results
show that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is abundant in HPs, and has augmented HP
contents during evolution. Especially, the disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and
ploy-(C/G) of coronaviruses increases during the evolution in human hosts. The
disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G) is correlated to host adaptation and
the virulence level of the coronaviruses. Therefore, we propose that the HP
disparity can be a quantitative measure for the zoonotic evolution levels of
coronaviruses. Peculiarly, the HP disparity measure infers that SARS-CoV-2
Omicron variants have a high disparity of HP poly-(A/T) and ploy-(C/G),
suggesting a high adaption to the human hosts.

laser of this size and incorporating atmospheric compensation would be able to
deliver laser power to spacecraft in cislunar space, where the incident laser
is focused into a hydrogen heating chamber via an inflatable reflector. The
hydrogen propellant is then exhausted through a nozzle to realize specific

We confirm the extremely high column densities, albeit slightly (0.1~dex) lower

H$_2$ detection rate ($10-55$% at 68% confidence level) at high HI column
density compared to the overall damped Lyman-$\alpha$ population ($\sim 5-10$%)
confirms previous works. We find that these seven ESDLAs have similar observed
properties as those previously studied towards quasars and gamma-ray burst
afterglows, suggesting they probe inner regions of galaxies. We use the
abundance of ionised carbon in excited fine-structure level to calculate the
cooling rates through the CII $\lambda$158$\mu$m emission, and compare them
with the cooling rates from damped Lyman-$\alpha$ systems in the literature. We
find that the cooling rates distribution of ESDLAs also presents the same
bimodality as previously observed for the general (mostly lower HI column

time-continuous evolution is often specified with superoperators referred to as
""Lindbladians"". Here we address the following question: Being given a quantum
map, can we find a Lindbladian which generates an evolution identical -- when
monitored at discrete instances of time -- to the one induced by the map? It
was demonstrated that the problem of getting the answer to this question can be
reduced to an NP-complete (in the dimension $N$ of the Hilbert space the

Complimentary, we use the performance of different ML methods as a tool to
check the hypothesis that the answer to the question is encoded in spectral
properties of the so-called Choi matrix, which can be constructed from the
given quantum map. As a test bed, we use two single-qubit models for which the
answer can be obtained by using the reduction procedure. The outcome of our

time-independent Lindbladian is encoded both in the eigenvalues and the
eigenstates of the corresponding Choi matrix.

problems in the research literature have been to either use value functions
(""dynamic programming"") or scenario trees (""stochastic programming"") to
approximate the impact of a decision now on the future. By contrast, common
industry practice is to use a deterministic approximation of the future which
is easier to understand and solve, but which is criticized for ignoring
uncertainty. We show that a parameterized version of a deterministic
optimization model can be an effective way of handling uncertainty without the
complexity of either stochastic programming or dynamic programming. We present
the idea of a parameterized deterministic optimization model, and in particular
a deterministic lookahead model, as a powerful strategy for many complex
stochastic decision problems. This approach can handle complex,
high-dimensional state variables, and avoids the usual approximations
associated with scenario trees or value function approximations. Instead, it
introduces the offline challenge of designing and tuning the parameterization.
We illustrate the idea by using a series of application settings, and
demonstrate its use in a nonstationary energy storage problem with rolling

integration of functions on spherical triangles. ARPIST is based on an
easy-to-implement transformation to the spherical triangle from its
corresponding linear triangle via radial projection to achieve high accuracy
and efficiency. More importantly, ARPIST overcomes potential instabilities in
computing the Jacobian of the transformation, even for poorly shaped triangles
that may occur at poles in regular longitude-latitude meshes, by avoiding
potential catastrophic rounding errors. We compare our proposed technique with
L'Huilier's Theorem for computing the area of spherical triangles, and also
compare it with the recently developed LSQST method (J. Beckmann, H.N. Mhaskar,

of the discretization error. Current approaches to this estimation rely on the
observed order of accuracy; however, studies have shown that it may alter
irregularly or become undefined. Therefore, we propose a grid refinement method
which adopts constant orders given by the user, called the Preset Orders
Expansion Method (POEM). The user is guaranteed to obtain the optimal set of
orders through iterations and hence an accurate estimate of the discretization
error. This method evaluates the reliability of the estimation by assessing the
convergence of the expansion terms, which is fundamental for all grid
refinement methods. We demonstrate these capabilities using advection and
diffusion problems along different refinement paths. POEM requires a lower
computational cost when the refinement ratio is higher. However, the estimated
error suffers from higher uncertainty due to the reduced number of shared grid
points. We circumvent this by using fractional refinement ratios and the Method
of Interpolating Differences between Approximate Solutions (MIDAS). As a
result, we can obtain a global estimate of the discretization error of lower
uncertainty at a reduced computational cost.

below the diffraction limit, which has been extensively used in bio-medical
imaging and nanophotonics. However, when the electromagnetic fields under
measurement are strongly confined, they can be heavily perturbed by the
presence of the near-field probe itself. Here, taking inspiration from
scattering-cancellation invisibility cloaks, Huygens-Kerker scatterers, and
cloaked sensors, we design and fabricate a cloaked near-field probe. We show
that, by suitably nanostructuring the probe, its electric and magnetic
polarizabilities can be controlled and balanced. As a result, probe-induced
perturbations can be largely suppressed, effectively cloaking the near-field
probe without preventing its ability to measure. We experimentally demonstrate
the cloaking effect by comparing the interaction of conventional and
nanostructured probes with a representative nanophotonic structure, namely, a
1D photonic-crystal cavity. Our results show that, by engineering the structure
of the probe, one can systematically control its back-action on the resonant
fields of the sample and decrease the perturbation by >70% with most of our
modified probes, and by up to one order of magnitude for the best probe, at
probe-sample distances of 100 nm. Our work paves the way for non-invasive
near-field optical microscopy of classical and quantum nano-systems.

recent advances in discrete self-supervised speech representation (DSSR).
Specifically, prosody vector is first extracted from pre-trained VQ-Wav2Vec

environment information are removed effectively by quantization. To further
filter out the redundant information except prosody, such as content and

universal purpose code, and on the other hand the networking primitives of IoT

OpenAPI Generator project, which can tailor the generated code based on the IoT

parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput.

performance. We call these ""grey-box"" BO methods because they treat objective
computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box
approach with so-called ""white-box"" first-principles knowledge of objective
function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of
composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate
individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and
multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the

policies consider the heterogenous characteristics of population and impose
more restrictions on old people and control the interactions between them and
the rest of population the devastating impact of COVID-19 on people lives and
US economy reduced dramatically. Specifically, based on this paper's results,
this strategy could reduce the death rate and GDP loss of the United States
0.03 percent and 2 percent respectively. By comparing these results with actual
data which show death rate and GDP loss 0.1 percent and 3.5 percent

could save 2/3 lives. Approximately, 378,000 persons dead because of COVID-19

along one direction of the flow drives a quasi-2D upscale flux of kinetic
energy, leading to the formation of strong vortex condensates at the largest
scales. Recent studies have shown that the transition towards this condensate
state is hysteretic, giving rise to a limited bistable range in which both the
condensate state as well as the regular 3D state can exist at the same
parameter values. In this work, we use direct numerical simulations of
thin-layer flow to investigate whether this bistable range survives as the
domain size and turbulence intensity are increased. By studying the time scales
at which rare transitions occur from one state into the other, we find that the
bistable range grows as the box size and/or Reynolds number Re are increased,
showing that the bistability is neither a finite-size nor a finite-Re effect.
We furthermore predict a crossover from a bimodal regime at low box size, low
Re to a regime of pure hysteresis at high box size, high Re, in which any
transition from one state to the other is prohibited at any finite time scale.

The method attempts to reduce selection bias, and relaxes the presumption of

approaches restricted to hazard ratio estimates. Theoretically, we establish
the asymptotic consistency of MARS, and investigate its relative efficiency
with respect to the individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. In
simulation studies, the MARS demonstrated comparable performance to IPD
meta-analysis with minor deviation from the true values, suggesting great
robustness and efficiency achievable in AD meta-analysis with finite sample.

associated with conventional light-flashing/flickering. Such benefits, however,
come with the price of having less accuracy and less Information Transfer Rate

paradigm without using resources such as trial time, phase, and/or number of
targets to enhance the ITR. The proposed design is based on the intuitively
pleasing idea of integrating more than one motion within a single SSmVEP target
stimuli, simultaneously. To elicit SSmVEP, we designed a novel and innovative
dual frequency aggregated modulation paradigm, referred to as the Dual
Frequency Aggregated steady-state motion Visual Evoked Potential (DF-SSmVEP),
by concurrently integrating ""Radial Zoom"" and ""Rotation"" motions in a single
target without increasing the trial length. Compared to conventional SSmVEPs,
the proposed DF-SSmVEP framework consists of two motion modes integrated and
shown simultaneously each modulated by a specific target frequency. The paper
also develops a specific unsupervised classification model, referred to as the
Bifold Canonical Correlation Analysis (BCCA), based on two motion frequencies
per target. The proposed DF-SSmVEP is evaluated based on a real EEG dataset and
the results corroborate its superiority. The proposed DF-SSmVEP outperforms its

is a building block of various real applications. Given any query nodes, CS
aims to find cohesive subgraphs that query nodes belong to. Recently, a large
number of CS algorithms are designed. These algorithms adopt predefined
subgraph patterns to model the communities, which cannot find ground-truth
communities that do not have such pre-defined patterns in real-world graphs.
Thereby, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based approaches are
proposed to capture flexible community structures by learning from ground-truth
communities in a data-driven fashion. These approaches rely on sufficient
training data to provide enough generalization for ML models, however, the
ground-truth cannot be comprehensively collected beforehand.
  In this paper, we study ML/DL-based approaches for CS, under the circumstance
of small training data. Instead of directly fitting the small data, we extract
prior knowledge which is shared across multiple CS tasks via learning a meta
model. Each CS task is a graph with several queries that possess corresponding
partial ground-truth. The meta model can be swiftly adapted to a task to be
predicted by feeding a few task-specific training data. We find that trivially
applying multiple classical metalearning algorithms to CS suffers from problems
regarding prediction effectiveness, generalization capability and efficiency.
To address such problems, we propose a novel meta-learning based framework,
Conditional Graph Neural Process (CGNP), to fulfill the prior extraction and
adaptation procedure. A meta CGNP model is a task-common node embedding
function for clustering, learned by metric-based graph learning, which fully
exploits the characteristics of CS. We compare CGNP with CS algorithms and ML
baselines on real graphs with ground-truth communities.

Nb$_2$C-MXene fabricated by the molten salts method is attracting wide
attention. However, regarding the superconductivity of Nb$_2$C-MXene with
functional F groups (Nb$_2$CF$_x$), there were some conflicting results in
experimental and theoretical studies. Herein, we systematically carried out
experimental and theoretical investigations on the superconductivity in
Nb$_2$C-MXene with the Cl functional group (Nb$_2$CCl$_x$) and Nb$_2$CF$_x$.
The experimental results of the Meissner effect and zero resistivity have
proved that Nb$_2$CClx is superconducting with the transition temperature (Tc)
~ 5.2 K. We extract its superconducting parameters from the temperature
dependence of resistivity and the field dependence of the magnetization. The
Ginzburg-Landau parameter K$_G$$_L$ is estimated to be 2.41, indicating that
Nb$_2$CClx is a typical type-II superconductor. Conversely, both magnetic and
electrical transport measurements demonstrate that Nb$_2$CF$_x$ is not
superconducting. The first-principles density functional theory (DFT)
calculations show that the Tc of Nb$_2$Cl$_x$ is ~ 5.2 K, while Nb$_2$CF$_x$ is
dynamically unstable with imaginary frequency in phonon spectrum, which is in
good agreement with the experimental results. Our studies not only are useful
for clarifying the present inconsistency but also offer referential
significance for future investigations on the superconductivity of MXenes.

are drawn from the same distribution. However, distribution shift is a common
problem in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically
worse at test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of
subpopulation shifts (e.g., imbalanced data) and domain shifts. While prior
works often seek to explicitly regularize internal representations or
predictors of the model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to learn
invariant predictors without restricting the model's internal representations
or predictors. This leads to a simple mixup-based technique which learns
invariant predictors via selective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively
interpolates samples either with the same labels but different domains or with
the same domain but different labels. Empirically, we study the effectiveness
of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts,
and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
and leads to more invariant predictors. We further analyze a linear setting and
theoretically show how LISA leads to a smaller worst-group error.

of large powers of Wigner matrices. Our approach is motivated from the paper by
\citet{sosh}. However the counting approach is different. We start with
classical word sentence approach similar to \citet{AZ05} and take the
motivation from \citet{sinaisosh}, \citet{sosh} and
\citet{peche2009universality} to encode the words to objects similar to Dyck
paths. To be precise the map takes a word to a Dyck path with some edges
removed from it. Using this new counting we prove edge universality for large
Wigner matrices with sub-Gaussian entries. One novelty of this approach is
unlike \citet{sinaisosh}, \citet{sosh} and \citet{peche2009universality} we do
not need to assume the entries of the matrices are symmetrically distributed
around $0$. The main technical contribution of this paper is two folded.
Firstly we produce an encoding of the ``contributing words"" (for definition one
might look at Section \ref{sec:word}) of the Wigner matrix which retrieves the
edge universality. Hence this is the best one can do. We hope this method will
be applicable to many other scenarios in random matrices. Secondly in course of
the paper we give a combinatorial description of the GOE Tracy Widom law. The
explanation for GUE is very similar. This explanation might be important for
the models where exact calculations are not available but some combinatorial
structures are present.

DiffuseVAE, a novel generative framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion
model framework, and leverage this to design novel conditional
parameterizations for diffusion models. We show that the resulting model equips
diffusion models with a low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code which can be
used for downstream tasks like controllable synthesis. The proposed method also
improves upon the speed vs quality tradeoff exhibited in standard unconditional
DDPM/DDIM models (for instance, FID of 16.47 vs 34.36 using a standard DDIM on
the CelebA-HQ-128 benchmark using T=10 reverse process steps) without having
explicitly trained for such an objective. Furthermore, the proposed model
exhibits synthesis quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard
image synthesis benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and CelebA-64 while outperforming most
existing VAE-based methods. Lastly, we show that the proposed method exhibits
inherent generalization to different types of noise in the conditioning signal.

classifiers are deployed as user-defined functions(UDFs), which are not
penetrable with classic query optimization techniques such as predicate
push-down. Recent optimization schemes (e.g., Probabilistic Predicates or PP)
assume independence among the query predicates, build a proxy model for each
predicate offline, and rewrite a new query by injecting these cheap proxy
models in the front of the expensive ML UDFs. In such a manner, unlikely inputs
that do not satisfy query predicates are filtered early to bypass the ML UDFs.
We show that enforcing the independence assumption in this context may result
in sub-optimal plans. In this paper, we propose CORE, a query optimizer that
better exploits the predicate correlations and accelerates ML inference
queries. Our solution builds the proxy models online for a new query and
leverages a branch-and-bound search process to reduce the building costs.
Results on three real-world text, image and video datasets show that CORE
improves the query throughput by up to 63% compared to PP and up to 80%

can support radiation therapy and image-guided surgery workflows. Developing of
such automatic solutions remains challenging mainly owing to complex organ
interactions and blurry boundaries in CT images. To address these issues, we
focus on effective spatial context modeling and explicit edge segmentation
priors. Accordingly, we propose a 3D network with four main components trained
end-to-end including shared encoder, edge detector, decoder with edge
skip-connections (ESCs) and recurrent feature propagation head (RFP-Head). To
capture wide-range spatial dependencies, the RFP-Head propagates and harvests
local features through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) formulated with recurrent
connections in an efficient slice-wise manner, with regard to spatial
arrangement of image units. To leverage edge information, the edge detector
learns edge prior knowledge specifically tuned for semantic segmentation by
exploiting intermediate features from the encoder with the edge supervision.
The ESCs then aggregate the edge knowledge with multi-level decoder features to
learn a hierarchy of discriminative features explicitly modeling
complementarity between organs' interiors and edges for segmentation. We
conduct extensive experiments on two challenging abdominal CT datasets with
eight annotated organs. Experimental results show that the proposed network
outperforms several state-of-the-art models, especially for the segmentation of
small and complicated structures (gallbladder, esophagus, stomach, pancreas and
duodenum). The code will be publicly available.

has a wide variety of applications, where deep learning approaches have
produced state-of-the-art results. While these models have been heavily
criticized for their black-box nature, their robustness to slight perturbations
in input text has been a matter of concern. In this work, we carry out a
data-focused study evaluating the impact of systematic practical perturbations
on the performance of the deep learning based text classification models like
CNN, LSTM, and BERT-based algorithms. The perturbations are induced by the
addition and removal of unwanted tokens like punctuation and stop-words that
are minimally associated with the final performance of the model. We show that
these deep learning approaches including BERT are sensitive to such legitimate
input perturbations on four standard benchmark datasets SST2, TREC-6, BBC News,
and tweet_eval. We observe that BERT is more susceptible to the removal of
tokens as compared to the addition of tokens. Moreover, LSTM is slightly more
sensitive to input perturbations as compared to CNN based model. The work also
serves as a practical guide to assessing the impact of discrepancies in
train-test conditions on the final performance of models.

energy device called the Hull Reservoir Wave Energy Converter (HRWEC). The

take-off system (PTO), which is integral to the hull structure. It is unique
due to its ability to convert wave energy by utilizing the pitch motion of the
hull and rotating flap due to the internal water movement in the hull. Due to
the complexity of the internal fluid dynamics, a CFD-based analysis was
considered most appropriate. The CFD investigation of the dynamics of the
device was done under regular wave conditions by using the ANSYS-AQWA and ANSYS
FLUENT. Relative pitch angle variation, the hydrodynamic coefficients, which
determine the degree of power extraction, were obtained from simulated results.
A simulation was designed exhibiting complete system dynamics for different
configurations varying on internal water height. Excellent convergence was
observed,and an optimum configuration was identified. It is expected to
validate the simulation results through experiments in the foreseeable future.

can interact and provide a route for kinetic energy (KE) dissipation of
balanced oceanic flows. A quasilinear model is developed to study the KE
exchanges between a two-dimensional geostrophically-balanced front undergoing
strain-induced semigeostrophic frontogenesis and internal wave (IW) vertical
modes. The quasilinear model is solved numerically for variable imposed strain
magnitudes, initial IW vertical modes, and for both minimum frequency
(near-inertial, NI) and high-frequency IWs. The front-IW KE exchanges are
quantified separately during two frontogenetic stages -- an exponential
sharpening stage that is characterized by a low Rossby number and is driven by
the imposed geostrophic strain, followed by a superexponential sharpening stage
that is characterized by an order-one Rossby number and is driven by the
convergence of the ageostrophic secondary circulation. It is demonstrated that
high-frequency IWs quickly escape the frontal zone and are very efficient at
extracting KE from the imposed geostrophic strain field through the deformation
shear production (DSP) mechanism. Part of the extracted KE is then converted to
wave potential energy. Minimum frequency IWs remain locked to the frontal zone
and therefore exchange energy with the ageostrophic frontal circulation. During
the exponential stage, IWs extract KE from the geostrophic strain through DSP
and transfer it to the frontal secondary circulation via the ageostrophic shear
production (AGSP) mechanism. During the superexponential stage a newly
identified mechanism, convergence production (CP), which is directly linked to
the convergent secondary circulation, plays an important role in the NIW KE
budget.

members of $\FF$ on $n$ vertices. The speed of $\FF$ is the function
$f(n)=|\FF_n|$. An implicit representation of size $\ell(n)$ for $\FF_n$ is a
function assigning a label of $\ell(n)$ bits to each vertex of any given graph
$G \in \FF_n$, so that the adjacency between any pair of vertices can be
determined by their labels. Bonamy, Esperet, Groenland and Scott proved that
the minimum possible size of an implicit representation of $\FF_n$ for any
hereditary family $\FF$ with speed $2^{\Omega(n^2)}$ is $(1+o(1)) \log_2
|\FF_n|/n~(=\Theta(n))$. A recent result of Hatami and Hatami shows that the
situation is very different for very sparse hereditary families. They showed
that for every $\delta>0$ there are hereditary families of graphs with speed
$2^{O(n \log n)}$ that do not admit implicit representations of size smaller
than $n^{1/2-\delta}$. In this note we show that even a mild speed bound
ensures an implicit representation of size $O(n^c)$ for some $c<1$.
Specifically we prove that for every $\eps>0$ there is an integer $d \geq 1$ so
that if $\FF$ is a hereditary family with speed $f(n) \leq 2^{(1/4-\eps)n^2}$
then $\FF_n$ admits an implicit representation of size $O(n^{1-1/d} \log n)$.
Moreover, for every integer $d>1$ there is a hereditary family for which this
is tight up to the logarithmic factor.

dictionary and HPD distance metric. Secondly, a new Tikhonov regularization
term is designed to reduce the differences within the same class. Finally, the
optimal method is developed and the first-order derivation is inferred. During
the experimental test, only T matrix is used in the proposed method, while
multiple of features are utilized for compared methods. Experimental results
demonstrate the proposed method can outperform the state-of-art algorithms even

be collected while maintaining high spatial resolution. Such techniques work
well in practice and at the same time are supported by solid theory. Standard
CS results assume measurements to be made directly on the targeted signal. In
many practical applications, however, CS information can only be taken from
indirect data $h_\star = W x_\star$ related to the original signal by an
additional forward operator. If inverting the forward operator is ill-posed,
then existing CS theory is not applicable. In this paper, we address this issue
and present two joint reconstruction approaches, namely relaxed $\ell^1$
co-regularization and strict $\ell^1$ co-regularization, for CS from indirect
data. As main results, we derive error estimates for recovering $x_\star$ and
$h_\star$. In particular, we derive a linear convergence rate in the norm for
the latter. To obtain these results, solutions are required to satisfy a source
condition and the CS measurement operator is required to satisfy a restricted
injectivity condition. We further show that these conditions are not only
sufficient but even necessary to obtain linear convergence.

better than (truncated) vine copula models when dependence can be explained

independence. To circumvent these issues, truncated vines and factor copula
models for item response data are joined to define a combined model, the
so-called factor tree copula model, with individual benefits from each of the
two approaches. Rather than adding factors and causing computational problems
and difficulties in interpretation and identification, a truncated vine
structure is assumed on the residuals conditional on one or two latent

given a few interpretable latent variables. On the one hand, the parsimonious
feature of factor models remains intact and any residual dependencies are being
taken into account on the other. We discuss estimation along with model

metallic state is observed at positive gate bias on single crystal surfaces. No
evidence for superconductivity is observed down to the lowest measured
temperature of 0.45 K, however. Based on transport, energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and
other techniques, we deduce an electrochemical gating mechanism involving a
substantial decrease in the S:Ni ratio (over hundreds of nm), which is both
non-volatile and irreversible. This is in striking contrast to the reversible,
volatile, surface-limited, electrostatic gate effect in pyrite FeS$_2$. We
attribute this stark difference in electrochemical vs. electrostatic gating
response in NiS$_2$ and FeS$_2$ to the much larger S diffusion coefficient in
NiS$_2$, analogous to the different behaviors observed among electrolyte-gated
oxides with differing O-vacancy diffusivities. The gating irreversibility, on
the other hand, is associated with the lack of atmospheric S; this is in
contrast to the better understood oxide case, where electrolysis of atmospheric
H$_2$O provides an O reservoir. This study of NiS$_2$ thus provides new insight
into electrolyte gating mechanisms in functional materials, in a previously

these approaches are all convolution-based, and are naturally weak in global
relation modeling of sub-aperture images necessarily to characterize the
inherent structure of light fields. In this paper, we put forth a novel
formulation built upon Transformers, by treating LFSR as a sequence-to-sequence
reconstruction task. In particular, our model regards sub-aperture images of
each vertical or horizontal angular view as a sequence, and establishes
long-range geometric dependencies within each sequence via a spatial-angular
locally-enhanced self-attention layer, which maintains the locality of each
sub-aperture image as well. Additionally, to better recover image details, we
propose a detail-preserving Transformer (termed as DPT), by leveraging gradient
maps of light field to guide the sequence learning. DPT consists of two
branches, with each associated with a Transformer for learning from an original
or gradient image sequence. The two branches are finally fused to obtain
comprehensive feature representations for reconstruction. Evaluations are
conducted on a number of light field datasets, including real-world scenes and
synthetic data. The proposed method achieves superior performance comparing
with other state-of-the-art schemes. Our code is publicly available at:

we show that there exists a (directed labeled) multigraph that encodes weights
at the fixed points of $M$. This includes the notion of a GKM graph as a
special case that weights at each fixed point are pairwise linearly
independent. If in addition $k=n$, i.e., $M$ is an almost complex torus

almost complex torus manifold $M$ satisfies $a_i(M) > 0$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$.
In particular, the Todd genus of $M$ is positive and there are at least $n+1$
fixed points. Petrie's conjecture asserts that if a homotopy $\mathbb{CP}^n$

$M$ only shares the Euler number with the complex projective space
$\mathbb{CP}^n$, an associated graph agrees with that of a linear $T^n$-action
on $\mathbb{CP}^n$; consequently $M$ has the same weights at the fixed points,
Chern numbers, equivariant cobordism class, Hirzebruch $\chi_y$-genus, Todd
genus, and signature as $\mathbb{CP}^n$. If furthermore $M$ is equivariantly
formal, the equivariant cohomology and the Chern classes of $M$ and

galaxy. As a member of the ULX family, NGC 300 ULX1 is a new pulsating ULX
(PULX) spinning up at substantially high rates compared with other PULXs. In
this paper, the strength of the magnetic field on the surface of the neutron
star is inferred from the energy of the cyclotron absorption line detected in
the pulsed X-ray spectrum of NGC 300 ULX1 and the plausible ranges for the
neutron-star mass and beaming fraction are estimated using the observed spin
period and period derivative of the pulsar and the measured X-ray flux of the
source. Our analysis favors proton cyclotron resonance scattering as a viable
mechanism to account for both the observed cyclotron energy and high spin-up
rates provided that the absorption line is generated close to the surface of
the neutron star.

resolvent-based control methodology with causality imposed via a Wiener-Hopf
formalism. Linear optimal causal estimation and control laws are obtained
directly from full-rank, globally stable systems with arbitrary disturbance
statistics, circumventing many drawbacks of alternative methods. We use
efficient, matrix-free methods to construct the matrix Wiener-Hopf problem, and
we implement a tailored method to solve the problem numerically. The approach
naturally handles forcing terms with space-time colour; it allows inexpensive
parametric investigation of sensor/actuator placement in scenarios where
disturbances/targets are low rank; it is directly applicable to complex flows
disturbed by high-rank forcing; it has lower cost in comparison to standard
methods; it can be used in scenarios where an adjoint solver is not available;
or it can be based exclusively on experimental data. The method is particularly
well-suited for the control of amplifier flows, for which optimal control
approaches are typically robust. Validation of the approach is performed using
the linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation. Flow over a backward-facing step
perturbed by high-rank forcing is then considered. Sensor and actuator
placement are investigated for this case, and we show that while the flow
response downstream of the step is dominated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanism,
it has a complex, high-rank receptivity to incoming upstream perturbations,
requiring multiple sensors for control.

methods are promising for extracting latent features from event graphs to
enable the use of different classification algorithms. However, existing
methods fail to meet essential requirements for event graphs, such as (i)
dealing with semi-supervised graph embedding to take advantage of some labeled
events, (ii) automatically determining the importance of the relationships
between event vertices and their metadata vertices, as well as (iii) dealing
with the graph heterogeneity. This paper presents GNEE (GAT Neural Event

all graph vertices receive event features, thereby mitigating the graph

the importance of relationships in the event graph during the representation
learning process. A statistical analysis of experimental results with five

viscoelasticity data of many cell types has been done successfully using
integer order mechanical and power-law viscoelastic models, there are some cell
types and conditions where the goodness of fits falls behind. Thus, fractional
order viscoelastic models have been proposed as more general and better suited
for such modeling. In this work, we test such proposed generality using
published data already fitted by integer order models. We find that cell
viscoelasticity data can be fitted using fractional order viscoelastic models
in more situations than integer order. For macrophages, which are among the
white blood cells that function in the immune system, the fractional order
Kelvin-Voigt model best captures pharmacological interventions and maturation
of the cells. The steady state viscosity of macrophages decreases following
depolymerization of F-actin using the drug cytochalasin D, and also decreases
following myosin II breakdown using Blebbistatin. When macrophages are treated
with a bacterium-derived chemoattractant, the steady state viscosity decreases.
Interestingly, both the steady state viscosity and elastic modulus are
progressively altered as the cells become mature and approach senescence. Taken
together, these results show that fractional viscoelastic modeling, more
robustly than integer order modeling, enables the further quantification of
cell function and malfunction, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic
applications especially in cases of cancer and immune system dysfunctions.

about 86.5\%, comparable to the state-of-the-art models that are less general
and more tuned to a specific type of question, subject, and language. More
importantly, we address trust and ethical concerns. By involving humans in the
autograding process, we show how to improve the accuracy of automatically
graded answers, achieving accuracy equivalent to that of teaching assistants.
We also show how teachers can effectively control the type of errors made by
the system and how they can validate efficiently that the autograder's
performance on individual exams is close to the expected performance.

Novia Berriel, Parag Banerjee, Kanad Basu","Machine Learning-enhanced Efficient Spectroscopic Ellipsometry Modeling",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Over the recent years, there has been an extensive adoption of Machine
Learning (ML) in a plethora of real-world applications, ranging from computer
vision to data mining and drug discovery. In this paper, we utilize ML to
facilitate efficient film fabrication, specifically Atomic Layer Deposition
(ALD). In order to make advances in ALD process development, which is utilized
to generate thin films, and its subsequent accelerated adoption in industry, it
is imperative to understand the underlying atomistic processes. Towards this
end, in situ techniques for monitoring film growth, such as Spectroscopic
Ellipsometry (SE), have been proposed. However, in situ SE is associated with
complex hardware and, hence, is resource intensive. To address these
challenges, we propose an ML-based approach to expedite film thickness
estimation. The proposed approach has tremendous implications of faster data
acquisition, reduced hardware complexity and easier integration of
spectroscopic ellipsometry for in situ monitoring of film thickness deposition.
Our experimental results involving SE of TiO2 demonstrate that the proposed
ML-based approach furnishes promising thickness prediction accuracy results of
88.76% within +/-1.5 nm and 85.14% within +/-0.5 nm intervals. Furthermore, we
furnish accuracy results up to 98% at lower thicknesses, which is a significant
improvement over existing SE-based analysis, thereby making our solution a
viable option for thickness estimation of ultrathin films.
