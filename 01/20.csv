spin-torque oscillator array that realizes the non-Hermitian
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Previous studies found that the linearized dynamics
can enter a topological regime in which the edge mode is driven into
auto-oscillation, while the bulk dynamics are suppressed. Here we investigate
the full non-linear and finite-temperature dynamics, whose understanding is
essential for spin-torque oscillators-based applications. Our analysis shows
that the lasing edge mode dynamics persist in the non-linear domain for a broad
range of parameters and temperatures. We investigate the effects of
perturbations relevant to experimental implementations and discuss which ones
might be detrimental to the stability of the lasing edge mode. Finally, we map
our model onto a photonic model. Our analysis has the potential to shed light
onto the dynamics of a plethora of non-Hermitian systems with non-linearities.

  strong coupling regime","14 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The transient dynamics of quantum coherence of Gaussian states are
investigated. The state is coupled to an external environment which can be
described by a Fano-Anderson type Hamiltonian. Solving the quantum Langevin
equation, we obtain the Greens functions which are used to compute the time
evolved first and second moments of the quadrature operators. From the
quadrature operator moments, we construct the covariance matrix which is used
to measure the coherence in the system. The coherence is measured using the
relative entropy of coherence measure. We consider three different classes of
spectral densities in our analysis viz, the Ohmic, the sub-Ohmic, and the
super-Ohmic densities. In our work, we study the dynamics of the coherent
state, squeezed state, and displaced squeezed state. For all these states we
observe that when the coupling with the system and the environment is weak, the
coherence monotonically decreases and eventually vanishes in a long time. Thus
all the states exhibit Markovian evolution in the weak coupling limit. In the
strong coupling limit, the dynamics for the initial period is Markovian and
after a certain period, it becomes non-Markovian where we observe an
environmental backaction on the system. Thus in the strong coupling limit, we
observe a dynamical crossover from Markovian nature to non-Markovian behavior.
This crossover is very abrupt under some environmental conditions and for some
parameters of the quantum state. Using a quantum master equation approach we
verify the crossover from the dynamics of the dissipation and fluctuation
parameters and the results endorse those obtained from coherence dynamics.

  Neuroimaging Data",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Multimodal data arise in various applications where information about the
same phenomenon is acquired from multiple sensors and across different imaging
modalities. Learning from multimodal data is of great interest in machine
learning and statistics research as this offers the possibility of capturing
complementary information among modalities. Multimodal modeling helps to
explain the interdependence between heterogeneous data sources, discovers new
insights that may not be available from a single modality, and improves
decision-making. Recently, coupled matrix-tensor factorization has been
introduced for multimodal data fusion to jointly estimate latent factors and
identify complex interdependence among the latent factors. However, most of the
prior work on coupled matrix-tensor factors focuses on unsupervised learning
and there is little work on supervised learning using the jointly estimated
latent factors. This paper considers the multimodal tensor data classification
problem. A Coupled Support Tensor Machine (C-STM) built upon the latent factors
jointly estimated from the Advanced Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization (ACMTF)
is proposed. C-STM combines individual and shared latent factors with multiple
kernels and estimates a maximal-margin classifier for coupled matrix tensor
data. The classification risk of C-STM is shown to converge to the optimal
Bayes risk, making it a statistically consistent rule. C-STM is validated
through simulation studies as well as a simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis. The
empirical evidence shows that C-STM can utilize information from multiple
sources and provide a better classification performance than traditional
single-mode classifiers.

interplays with one another, governed by non-Abelian brackets with structure

certain Abelian substructure within general hypersurface deformations, which
suggests a simplified realization as a Lie algebra. The generators of this
substructure can be quantized more easily than full hypersurface deformations,
but the symmetries they generate do not directly correspond to hypersurface
deformations. The availability of consistent quantizations therefore does not
guarantee general covariance or a meaningful quantum notion thereof. In
addition to placing the Abelian substructure within the full context of
spherically symmetric hypersurface deformation, this paper points out several
subtleties relevant for attempted applications in quantized space-time

exploitability from one iteration to the next. Unlike DO, in which the
restricted distribution is based on the restricted game formed by each player's
strategy sets, ADO finds the restricted distribution for each player that
minimizes its exploitability against any policy in the full, unrestricted game.
We also propose a method of finding this restricted distribution via a
no-regret algorithm updated against best responses, called RM-BR DO. Finally,
we propose anytime PSRO (APSRO), a version of ADO that calculates best

the last stages of accretion in low-mass young stars, we conducted a survey of
disk-bearing stars that are thought to be non-accretors to identify stars still
accreting at very low rates. Here we present the first catalog of the survey of
170 disk-bearing non-accreting stars in Chamaeleon I, Orion OB1, Upper
Scorpius, $\gamma$ Velorum, and Upper Centaurus Lupus, using He I
$\lambda$10830 as a sensitive probe of accretion. We classify the line profiles
into six types and argue that those showing redshifted and/or blueshifted
absorption are still accreting. Using these classifications, we found that,
among disk-bearing stars previously classified as non-accretors, at least
20-30% are still accreting, with a larger fraction of those at younger
population ages. While the difference between the outer disk signature and
accretion status is unclear, we find a difference between the inner disk excess
and accretion status. There is no preference in the mass of the newly
identified accretors, suggesting that the processes inhibiting accretion do not
directly depend on mass in the typical mass range of T Tauri stars. Lastly, we
found that at a low accretion level, the H$\alpha$ width at the 10% height
criteria mischaracterizes a larger fraction of accretors than the line's

biased selected nodes leads to significant parameter estimation bias and
greatly impacts the generalization ability on test nodes. In this paper, we
first present an experimental investigation, which clearly shows that the
selection bias drastically hinders the generalization ability of GNNs, and
theoretically prove that the selection bias will cause the biased estimation on
GNN parameters. Then to remove the bias in GNN estimation, we propose a novel
Debiased Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with a differentiated decorrelation
regularizer. The differentiated decorrelation regularizer estimates a sample
weight for each labeled node such that the spurious correlation of learned

it motivates us to differentiate the weights of the variables based on their
contribution on the confounding bias. Then, these sample weights are used for
reweighting GNNs to eliminate the estimation bias, thus help to improve the
stability of prediction on unknown test nodes. Comprehensive experiments are
conducted on several challenging graph datasets with two kinds of label

  Surrogate Rule Sets",,,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the potential solutions for model interpretation is to train a
surrogate model: a more transparent model that approximates the behavior of the
model to be explained. Typically, classification rules or decision trees are
used due to the intelligibility of their logic-based expressions. However,
decision trees can grow too deep and rule sets can become too large to
approximate a complex model. Unlike paths on a decision tree that must share
ancestor nodes (conditions), rules are more flexible. However, the unstructured
visual representation of rules makes it hard to make inferences across rules.
To address these issues, we present a workflow that includes novel algorithmic
and interactive solutions. First, we present Hierarchical Surrogate Rules
(HSR), an algorithm that generates hierarchical rules based on user-defined
parameters. We also contribute SuRE, a visual analytics (VA) system that
integrates HSR and interactive surrogate rule visualizations. Particularly, we
present a novel feature-aligned tree to overcome the shortcomings of existing
rule visualizations. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of parameter
sensitivity, time performance, and comparison with surrogate decision trees and
find that it scales reasonably well and outperforms decision trees in many
respects. We also evaluate the visualization and the VA system by a usability
study with 24 volunteers and an observational study with 7 domain experts. Our
investigation shows that the participants can use feature-aligned trees to
perform non-trivial tasks with very high accuracy. We also discuss many
interesting observations that can be useful for future research on designing
effective rule-based VA systems.

content shared online had a significant adverse effect on society. To mitigate
this adverse effect, mainstream social media platforms employed soft moderation
interventions (i.e., warning labels) on potentially harmful posts. Despite the
recent popularity of these moderation interventions, we lack empirical analyses
aiming to uncover how these warning labels are used in the wild, particularly
during challenging times like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we analyze
the use of warning labels on TikTok, focusing on COVID-19 videos. First, we
construct a set of 26 COVID-19 related hashtags, then we collect 41K videos
that include those hashtags in their description. Second, we perform a
quantitative analysis on the entire dataset to understand the use of warning
labels on TikTok. Then, we perform an in-depth qualitative study, using
thematic analysis, on 222 COVID-19 related videos to assess the content and the
connection between the content and the warning labels. Our analysis shows that
TikTok broadly applies warning labels on TikTok videos, likely based on
hashtags included in the description. More worrying is the addition of COVID-19
warning labels on videos where their actual content is not related to COVID-19
(23% of the cases in a sample of 143 English videos that are not related to
COVID-19). Finally, our qualitative analysis on a sample of 222 videos shows
that 7.7% of the videos share misinformation/harmful content and do not include
warning labels, 37.3% share benign information and include warning labels, and
that 35% of the videos that share misinformation/harmful content (and need a
warning label) are made for fun. Our study demonstrates the need to develop
more accurate and precise soft moderation systems, especially on a platform

($>450$ d) in the RVs, which could be due to either an external planetary
companion or to stellar magnetic activity. The precise masses and radii
obtained for the four planets allowed us to conduct interior structure and
atmospheric escape modelling. TOI-561 b is confirmed to be the lowest density
($\rho_{\rm b} = 3.8 \pm 0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$) ultra-short period (USP) planet
known to date, and the low metallicity of the host star makes it consistent
with the general bulk density-stellar metallicity trend. According to our
interior structure modelling, planet b has basically no gas envelope, and it
could host a certain amount of water. In contrast, TOI-561 c, d, and e likely
retained an H/He envelope, in addition to a possibly large water layer. The
inferred planetary compositions suggest different atmospheric evolutionary
paths, with planets b and c having experienced significant gas loss, and
planets d and e showing an atmospheric content consistent with the original
one. The uniqueness of the USP planet, the presence of the long-period planet
TOI-561 e, and the complex architecture make this system an appealing target
for follow-up studies.

impostor scenario, to account for AT2018cow-like fast blue optical transients
(FBOTs). The polar CEJSN impostor scenario evolves through four main phases.
(1) A red supergiant (RSG) star expands to tidally interact with a neutron star
(NS) companion (or a black hole). The interaction increases the RSG mass loss
rate to form a circumstellar matter (CSM) halo to ~0.1pc. (2) Shortly before
the onset of a common envelope evolution (CEE) and about a year before
explosion the NS accretes mass from the RSG envelope and launches jets that
inflate two opposite lobes in the CSM within ~100AU. (3) The NS-RSG system
enters a CEE phase during which the system ejects most of the envelope mass in
a dense equatorial outflow. (4) At the termination of the CEE the leftover
envelope forms a circumbinary disk around the NS-core system. The NS accretes
mass from the circumbinary disk and launches energetic jets that when collide
with the fronts of the CSM lobes power an FBOT event. The low mass of the
jets-lobes interaction zones and their large distance, of about 100AU, from the
center account for the fast transient. In the future the core collapses to form
a second NS. In the far future the two NS might merge. I suggest that FBOTs and
similar fast transients are CEJSN impostors which compose a large fraction of
the progenitors of NS-NS merger binaries.

the Migdal-Eliashberg equations, which are solved both numerically and

We do not find evidence for plasmon-mediated pairing within a reasonable
parameter range. However, it is shown that the hyperbolic plasmons can
significantly reduce the effects of Coulomb repulsion in the Cooper channel
leading to an enhancement of the transition temperature originating from other
pairing mechanisms. In the model of a hyperbolic material composed of identical
layers, we find this enhancement to be the strongest in the $d$-wave channel.

solvable, as well as reduces overheads and bypasses computational hardness
results, and it is pervasive in the privacy-preserving computation literature.
However, it remains highly susceptible to covert, undetectable collusion among
computing parties. This work stems from an observation that if the number of

to perform a secure computation task, collusion attempts in privacy-preserving
computations could be deterred.
  We focus on the prominent privacy-preserving computation task of multi-server
$1$-private information retrieval (PIR) that inherently assumes no pair-wise
collusion. For PIR application scenarios, such as those for blockchain light
clients, where the available servers can be plentiful, a single server's
deviating action is not tremendously beneficial to itself. We can make
deviations undesired via small amounts of rewards and penalties, thus
significantly {\em raising the bar} for collusion resistance. We design and

summarized. Then, a system organization consisting of synchronized segments is
described. The segments are feedforward internally with feedback between
segments. A synchronizing clock resets network segments at the end of each
computation step or cycle. In its basic form, the synchronizing clock merely
performs a reset function. In the context of neural networks, this satisfies
biological plausibility. However, functional completeness is restricted. This

provide a useful picture for chemical bonding and offer a localized description

produce Wannier functions that have advantageous properties. A popular choice
for this freedom is the minimization of spatial variance, which leads to
maximally localized Wannier functions. We minimize a weighted sum of the
spatial and energy variances, yielding what we call dually localized Wannier
functions. Localization in energy results in Wannier functions that are
associated with a particular energy and allows for dually localized Wannier
functions to be comprised of occupied and unoccupied spaces simulatneously.
This can lead to Wannier functions that are fractionally occupied, which is a
key feature that is used in correcting the delocalization error in density
functional approximations. We show how this type of localization results in
bonding (antibonding) functions for the occupied (unoccupied) spaces around the
frontier energy of silicon in the diamond lattice and of molecular ethylene.
Dually localized Wannier functions therefore offer a relevant description for
chemical bonding and are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that
associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges without the need to
consider the occupied and unoccupied spaces separately.

emergent magnetic-field geometry depend sensitively on the material properties
of the plasma, in particular on the Reynolds number ${\rm Re}$, the magnetic
Reynolds number ${\rm Rm}$, and their ratio ${\rm Pm}\equiv{\rm Rm}/{\rm Re}$.
For ${\rm Pm} > 1$, the amplified magnetic field is gradually arranged into a
folded structure, with direction reversals at the resistive scale and field
lines curved at the larger scale of the flow. As the mean magnetic energy grows
to come into approximate equipartition with the fluid motions, this folded
structure is thought to persist. Using analytical theory and high-resolution
MHD simulations with the Athena++ code, we show that these magnetic folds
become unstable to tearing during the nonlinear stage of the dynamo for ${\rm
Rm}\gtrsim 10^4$ and ${\rm Re}\gtrsim 10^3$. An ${\rm Rm}$- and ${\rm
Pm}$-dependent tearing scale, at and below which folds are disrupted, is
predicted theoretically and found to match well the characteristic
field-reversal scale measured in the simulations. The disruption of folds by
tearing increases the ratio of viscous-to-resistive dissipation. In the
saturated state, the magnetic-energy spectrum exhibits a sub-tearing-scale
steepening to a slope consistent with that predicted for tearing-mediated
Alfv\'enic turbulence. Its spectral peak appears to be independent of the
resistive scale and comparable to the driving scale of the flow, while the
magnetic energy resides in a broad range of scales extending down to the
field-reversal scale set by tearing. Emergence of a degree of large-scale
magnetic coherence in the saturated state of the turbulent dynamo may be
consistent with observations of magnetic-field fluctuations in galaxy clusters
and recent laboratory experiments.

without harming the licensed users; they offer great promise in optimizing
spectrum utility, but their management (in particular, efficient spectrum
allocation to unlicensed users) is challenging. A significant shortcoming of
current allocation methods is that they are either done very conservatively to
ensure correctness, or are based on imperfect propagation models and/or
spectrum sensing with poor spatial granularity. This leads to poor spectrum
utilization, the fundamental objective of shared spectrum systems.
  To allocate spectrum near-optimally to secondary users in general scenarios,
we fundamentally need to have knowledge of the signal path-loss function. In
practice, however, even the best known path-loss models have unsatisfactory
accuracy, and conducting extensive surveys to gather path-loss values is
infeasible. To circumvent this challenge, we propose to learn the spectrum
allocation function directly using supervised learning techniques. We
particularly address the scenarios when the primary users' information may not
be available; for such settings, we make use of a crowdsourced sensing
architecture and use the spectrum sensor readings as features. We develop an
efficient CNN-based approach (called DeepAlloc) and address various challenges
that arise in its application to the learning the spectrum allocation function.
Via extensive large-scale simulation and a small testbed, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our developed techniques; in particular, we observe that our

fundamental quantum gate is dual unitary. Such models are solvable: the
dynamical correlation functions of the infinite temperature ensemble can be
computed exactly. We review various existing constructions for dual unitary
gates and we supplement them with new ideas in a number of cases. We discuss
connections with various topics in physics and mathematics, including quantum
information theory, tensor networks for the AdS/CFT correspondence (holographic
error correcting codes), classical combinatorial designs (orthogonal Latin
squares), planar algebras, and Yang-Baxter maps. Afterwards we consider the
ergodicity properties of a special class of dual unitary models, where the
local gate is a permutation matrix. We find an unexpected phenomenon:
non-ergodic behaviour can manifest itself in multi-site correlations, even in
those cases when the one-site correlation functions are fully chaotic
(completely thermalizing). We also discuss the circuits built out of perfect
tensors. They appear locally as the most chaotic and most scrambling circuits,
nevertheless they can show global signs of non-ergodicity: if the perfect
tensor is constructed from a linear map over finite fields, then the resulting
circuit can show exact quantum revivals at unexpectedly short times. A brief
mathematical treatment of the recurrence time in such models is presented in
the Appendix by Roland Bacher and Denis Serre.

use Transformers with a cross-view attention mechanism that models spatial

classical and quantum applications for imaging, information processing and
communication. However, the complex structure inherent in OAM states makes
their detection and classification nontrivial in many circumstances. Most of
the current detection schemes are based on models of the OAM states built upon
the use of Laguerre-Gauss modes. However, this may not in general be sufficient
to capture full information on the generated states. In this paper, we go
beyond the Laguerre-Gauss assumption, and employ Hypergeometric-Gaussian modes
as the basis states of a refined model that can be used -- in certain scenarios
-- to better tailor OAM detection techniques. We show that enhanced
performances in OAM detection are obtained for holographic projection via
spatial light modulators in combination with single-mode fibers, and for
classification techniques based on a machine learning approach. Furthermore, a
three-fold enhancement in the single-mode fiber coupling efficiency is obtained
for the holographic technique, when using the Hypergeometric-Gaussian model
with respect to the Laguerre-Gauss one. This improvement provides a significant
boost in the overall efficiency of OAM-encoded single-photon detection systems.
Given that most of the experimental works using OAM states are effectively
based on the generation of Hypergeometric-Gauss modes, our findings thus
represent a relevant addition to experimental toolboxes for OAM-based protocols
in quantum communication, cryptography and simulation.

virtual reality and digital entertainment. While most previous studies rely on
accurate explicit structural information, recent works explore the implicit
scene representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for realistic generation.
In order to capture the inconsistent motions as well as the semantic difference
between human head and torso, some work models them via two individual sets of
NeRF, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we propose Semantic-aware
Speaking Portrait NeRF (SSP-NeRF), which creates delicate audio-driven
portraits using one unified set of NeRF. The proposed model can handle the
detailed local facial semantics and the global head-torso relationship through
two semantic-aware modules. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Aware
Dynamic Ray Sampling module with an additional parsing branch that facilitates
audio-driven volume rendering. Moreover, to enable portrait rendering in one
unified neural radiance field, a Torso Deformation module is designed to
stabilize the large-scale non-rigid torso motions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our proposed approach renders more realistic video portraits
compared to previous methods. Project page:

turbulence in collisionless plasmas can result in an equilibrium particle
distribution function where turbulent heating is balanced by radiative cooling
of electrons. Strongly magnetized plasmas are characterized by higher energy
peaks and broader particle distributions. In relativistically moving
astrophysical jets, it is believed that the flow is launched Poynting flux
dominated and that the resulting magnetic instabilities may create a turbulent
environment inside the jet, i.e., the regime of relativistic turbulence. In
this paper, we extend previous PIC simulation results to larger values of
plasma magnetization by linearly extrapolating the diffusion and advection
coefficients relevant for the turbulent plasmas under consideration. We use
these results to build a single zone turbulent jet model that is based on the
global parameters of blazar emission region, and consistently calculate the
particle distribution and resulting synchrotron and inverse Compton emission
spectra. We then test our model by comparing its predictions with the
broad-band quiescent emission spectra of a dozen blazars. Our results show good
agreement with observations of low-synchrotron peaked (LSP) sources and find
that LSPs are moderately Poynting flux dominated with magnetization $1\lesssim
\sigma \lesssim 5$, have bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma\sim 10-30$, and that the
turbulent region is located at the edge, or just beyond, the broad line region
(BLR). The turbulence is found to be driven at an area comparable to the jet
cross section.

conjectured to exhibit universal patterns of long-range entanglement which may
be detected by a mixed-state entanglement measure known as entanglement
negativity. We show that the entanglement negativity in certain topological
orders can be understood through the properties of an emergent
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order which is localized on the
entanglement bipartition. This connection leads to an understanding of ($i$)
universal contributions to the entanglement negativity which diagnose
finite-temperature topological order, and ($ii$) the behavior of the
entanglement negativity across certain phase transitions in which thermal
fluctuations eventually destroy long-range entanglement across the bipartition
surface. Within this correspondence, the universal patterns of entanglement in
the finite-temperature topological order are related to the stability of an
emergent SPT order against a symmetry-breaking field. SPT orders protected by
higher-form symmetries -- which arise, for example, in the description of the
entanglement negativity for $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological order in $d=4$ spatial
dimensions -- remain robust even in the presence of a weak symmetry-breaking
perturbation, leading to long-range entanglement at non-zero temperature for
certain topological orders.

measured in the near-infrared (NIR) than in the optical. With this motivation,
from 2012-2017 we embarked on the RAISIN program with the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) to obtain rest-frame NIR light curves for a cosmologically
distant sample of 37 SN Ia ($0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.6$) discovered by
Pan-STARRS and the Dark Energy Survey. By comparing higher-$z$ HST data with 42
SN Ia at $z<0.1$ observed in the NIR by the Carnegie Supernova Project, we
construct a Hubble diagram from NIR observations (with only time of maximum
light and some selection cuts from optical data) to pursue a unique avenue to
constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$. We analyze the
dependence of the full set of Hubble residuals on the SN Ia host galaxy mass
and find Hubble residual steps of size $\sim$0.06-0.1~mag with 1.5- to
2.5-$\sigma$ significance depending on the method and step location. Combining
our NIR sample with CMB constraints, we find $1+w=-0.17\pm0.12$ (stat$+$syst).
The largest systematic errors are the redshift-dependent SN selection biases
and the properties of the NIR mass step. We also use these data to measure
$H_0=75.9\pm 2.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ from stars with geometric distance
calibration in the hosts of 8 SNe Ia observed in the NIR versus
$H_0=71.2\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ using an inverse distance ladder
approach tied to Planck. Using optical data we find $1+w=-0.10\pm0.09$ and with
optical and NIR data combined, we find $1+w=-0.06\pm0.07$; these shifts of up
to 0.11 in $w$ could point to inconsistency in optical versus NIR SN models.
There will be many opportunities to improve this NIR measurement and better
understand systematic uncertainties through larger low-$z$ samples, new
light-curve models, calibration improvements, and by building high-$z$ samples
from the Roman Space Telescope.

explain the observed behavior, we introduce the effective distance $d'$, which
reduces to the standard distance for unbiased noise. To study CDSC performance

mechanical mapping for quantum codes, we uncover a phase diagram that describes
random CDSCs with $50\%$ threshold at infinite bias. In the high-threshold

outperform the thresholds and subthreshold logical error rates of the best

fundamental differences in the radio properties of red and blue quasars by
stacking 1.4 GHz FIRST images at their positions, suggesting the observed
differences cannot be attributed to orientation. Instead, the differences
between red and blue quasars likely arise on nuclear-galactic scales, perhaps
owing to reddening by a nuclear dusty wind. Finally, we show that
optically-selected quasars' halo environments are also independent of their
$r-W2$ optical-infrared colors, while previous work has suggested that
mid-infrared-selected obscured quasars occupy more massive halos. We discuss
implications of this result for models of quasar and galaxy co-evolution.

early-type galaxies at $z\sim 0$, the $M_*/L$ gradients are weak if driven by
variations in age and metallicity, but significantly larger if driven by the
IMF. A gradient which has larger $M_*/L$ in the center increases the estimated

While the covering fraction of cool gas in clusters decreases with increasing

nonetheless $\sim 10$ times higher than for SDSS luminous red galaxies (LRGs).
The MgII covering fraction versus impact parameter is well described by a power

large equivalent width absorbers. Cross-correlating MgII absorption with
photo-z selected cluster member galaxies from DESI reveals a statistically

random mocks with the same galaxy density profiles. We do not find a

of galaxies, and (iii) may originate in part from gas stripped from these

these data with observations from CANDELS at high redshifts. Additionally, we
compare the observations to detailed predictions from the LGalaxies
semi-analytic model. To analyse the data, we developed a machine learning
approach utilising a Random Forest classifier. We first demonstrate that this
technique is extremely effective at extracting causal insight from highly
complex and inter-correlated model data, before applying it to various
observational surveys. Our primary observational results are as follows: At all
redshifts studied in this work, we find bulge mass to be the most predictive
parameter of quenching, out of the photometric parameter set (incorporating
bulge mass, disk mass, total stellar mass, and $B/T$ structure). Moreover, we
also find bulge mass to be the most predictive parameter of quenching in both
bulge and disk structures, treated separately. Hence, intrinsic galaxy
quenching must be due to a stable mechanism operating over cosmic time, and the
same quenching mechanism must be effective in both bulge and disk regions.
Despite the success of bulge mass in predicting quenching, we find that central
velocity dispersion is even more predictive (when available in spectroscopic
data sets). In comparison to the LGalaxies model, we find that all of these
observational results may be consistently explained through quenching via
preventative `radio-mode' active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Furthermore,
many alternative quenching mechanisms (including virial shocks, supernova
feedback, and morphological stabilisation) are found to be inconsistent with
our observational results and those from the literature.

circumbinary accretion discs remains unexplored. We have carried out a suite of
circumbinary disc simulations surveying both disc thickness and kinematic
viscosity, using both constant-$\nu$ and constant-$\alpha$ prescriptions. We
focus primarily on disc aspect ratios between $0.1$ and $0.033$, and on
viscosities between $\nu=0.0005$ and $\nu=0.008$ (in units of binary semi-major
axis and orbital frequency), and specialise to circular equal-mass binaries.
Both factors strongly influence the evolution of the binary semi-major axis: at
$\nu=0.0005,$ inspirals occur at aspect ratios $\lesssim0.059$, while at
$\nu=0.004$ inspirals occur only at aspect ratios $\lesssim0.04$. Inspirals
occur largely because of the increasingly strong negative torque on the binary
by streams of material which lag the binary, with negligible contributions from
resonant torques excited in the circumbinary disc. We find that reductions in
accretion rate occur when simulations are initialised too far from the eventual
quasi-steady state driven by interaction with the binary, rather than being
intrinsically linked to the disc aspect ratio. We find not only that the cavity
size increases as viscosity is decreased, but that thinner circumbinary discs
become more eccentric. Our results suggest that supermassive black hole
binaries should be driven, more rapidly than previous estimates, from
$\sim$parsec separations to distances where gravitational waves drive their
inspiral, potentially reducing the number of binaries observable by pulsar
timing arrays.

described with the Stellar-to-Halo Mass relation (SHMR). Satellite galaxies in
clusters have been shown to follow a SHMR distinct from central galaxies
because of the environmental processes that they are subject to. In addition,
the variety of accretion histories leads to an important scatter in this
relation, even more for satellites than for central galaxies. In this work, we
use the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to study the scatter in the
satellite galaxy SHMR, and extract the parameters that can best allow to
understand it. Active galaxies, that represent a very small fraction of cluster
galaxies, follow a very different relation than their passive counterparts,
mainly because they were accreted much more recently. For this latter
population, we find that the distance to the cluster centre is a good predictor
of variations in the SHMR, but some information on the galaxy orbital history,
such as the distance of closest approach to the host centre, is an even better
one, although it is in practice more difficult to measure. In addition, we
found that galaxy compactness is also correlated with the SHMR, while the host
cluster properties (mass and concentration, formation redshift, mass and size
of BCG) do not play a significant role. We provide accurate fitting functions
and scaling relations to the scientific community, useful to predict the
subhalo mass given a set of observable parameters. Finally, we connect the
scatter in the SHMR to the physical processes affecting galaxies in clusters,
and how they impact the different satellite sub-populations.

current through the device above a certain voltage threshold, in close analogy
with a lasing transition. We investigate this phenomenon from the perspective
of work extraction, by modelling a nano-electromechanical device as a quantum
flywheel or battery that converts electrical power into stored mechanical
energy. We introduce a microscopic model that qualitatively matches the
experimental finding, and compute the Wigner function of the quantum
vibrational mode in its non-equilibrium steady-state. We characterise the
threshold for self-sustained oscillations using two approaches to quantifying
work deposition in non-equilibrium quantum thermodynamics: the ergotropy and
the non-equilibrium free energy. We find that ergotropy serves as an order
parameter for the phonon lasing transition. The framework we employ to describe
work extraction is general and widely transferable to other mesoscopic quantum
devices.

of the overall device time. We therefore tackle them separately by (1) flexibly
adopting heuristic-based and ML-based kernel performance models for operators
that dominate the device active time, and (2) categorizing operator overheads
into five types to determine quantitatively their contribution to the device
active time. Combining these two parts, we propose a critical-path-based
algorithm to predict the per-batch training time of DLRM by traversing its
execution graph. We achieve less than 10% geometric mean average error (GMAE)
in all kernel performance modeling, and 4.61% and 7.96% geomean errors for GPU
active time and overall E2E per-batch training time prediction with overheads
from individual workloads, respectively. A slight increase of 2.19% incurred in
E2E prediction error with shared overheads across workloads suggests the
feasibility of using shared overheads in large-scale prediction. We show that
our general performance model not only achieves low prediction error on DLRM,
which has highly customized configurations and is dominated by multiple factors
but also yields comparable accuracy on other compute-bound ML models targeted
by most previous methods. Using this performance model and graph-level data and
task dependency analysis, we show our system can provide more general

almost twice coding efficiency compared to its predecessor, the High Efficiency
Video Coding (HEVC). However, achieving this efficiency (for intra coding)
requires 31x computational complexity compared to HEVC, making it challenging
for low power and real-time applications. This paper, proposes a novel machine
learning approach that jointly and separately employs two modalities of
features, to simplify the intra coding decision. First a set of features are
extracted that use the existing DCT core of VVC, to assess the texture
characteristics, and forms the first modality of data. This produces high
quality features with almost no overhead. The distribution of intra modes at
the neighboring blocks is also used to form the second modality of data, which
provides statistical information about the frame. Second, a two-step feature
reduction method is designed that reduces the size of feature set, such that a
lightweight model with a limited number of parameters can be used to learn the
intra mode decision task. Third, three separate training strategies are
proposed (1) an offline training strategy using the first (single) modality of
data, (2) an online training strategy that uses the second (single) modality,
and (3) a mixed online-offline strategy that uses bimodal learning. Finally, a
low-complexity encoding algorithms is proposed based on the proposed learning
strategies. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed methods can
reduce up to 24% of encoding time, with a negligible loss of coding efficiency.
Moreover, it is demonstrated how a bimodal learning strategy can boost the
performance of learning. Lastly, the proposed method has a very low
computational overhead (0.2%), and uses existing components of a VVC encoder,
which makes it much more practical compared to competing solutions.

from liquid is important to a wide range of applications, such as water
purification, material deposition, and biomedical engineering. Such separation
is usually achieved by displacing liquid via filtration or distillation.
However, directly moving small particles out of liquid is difficult, especially
when their sizes approach the nanometer scale, as the capillary force on the NP
at the liquid surface is too large for common body forces (e.g., optical or
magnetic) to overcome. Here, we demonstrate the ability to eject metallic NPs
out of liquid with a laser excitation at their surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
wavelength. The laser applies an optical force on the NPs to drive them toward
the liquid surface. In the meantime, the laser can also intensely heat the NP
to form a nanobubble encapsulating the NP (i.e., supercavitation), which
achieves the liquid-NP separation and thus eliminates the capillary force on
the NP at the liquid free surface. We show that such a mechanism can expel NPs
out of liquid as observed using a transient scattering experiment, which is
further confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. We also demonstrate
depositing the NPs on a solid surface not in contact with the liquid. This
study reveals an interesting mechanism to separate NPs from liquid and could
potentially benefit separation, nanomaterials and biomedical applications.

interactions renormalize the low energy nearly flat band structure, leading to
a Heisenberg model which decisively depends on the Coulomb interactions. Based
on this, we show that superexchange couplings in the material can be precisely
tailored by means of environmental dielectric screening, ultimately allowing to
externally drive the material towards the quantum spin-liquid regime. Our
results put forward Coulomb engineering as a powerful tool to manipulate
magnetic properties of van der Waals materials.

Radioheliograph (NRH) in order to study spike-like bursts near the front of a
type-II radio burst during the November 3, 2003 extreme solar event. The
spike-like emission in the dynamic spectrum was enhanced by means of
high-pass-time filtering. We identified a number of spikes in the NRH images.
Due to the lower temporal resolution of the NRH, multiple spikes detected in
the dynamic spectrum appeared as single structures in the images. These spikes
had an average size of ~200"" and their observed brightness temperature was
1.4-5.6x10^9K, providing a significant contribution to the emission of the
type-II burst front. At variance with a previous study on the type-IV
associated spikes, we found no systematic displacement between the spike
emission and the emission between spikes. At 327.0 MHz, the type II emission
was located about 0.3 RSUN above the pre-existing continuum emission, which,
was located 0.1 RSUN above the western limb. This study indicates that the
spike-like chains aligned along the type II burst MHD shock front are not a
perturbation of the type II emission, as in the case of type IV spikes, but a
manifestation of the type II emission itself. The preponderance of these
chains, together with the lack of isolated structures or irregular clusters,
points towards some form of small-scale magnetic reconnection, organized along
the type-II propagating front.

However, in a mixed traffic environment at signalized intersections, it is
still a challenging task to improve overall throughput and energy efficiency
considering the complexity and uncertainty in the traffic system. In this
study, we proposed a hybrid reinforcement learning (HRL) framework which
combines the rule-based strategy and the deep reinforcement learning (deep RL)
to support connected eco-driving at signalized intersections in mixed traffic.
Vision-perceptive methods are integrated with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
communications to achieve higher mobility and energy efficiency in mixed
connected traffic. The HRL framework has three components: a rule-based driving
manager that operates the collaboration between the rule-based policies and the
RL policy; a multi-stream neural network that extracts the hidden features of
vision and V2I information; and a deep RL-based policy network that generate
both longitudinal and lateral eco-driving actions. In order to evaluate our
approach, we developed a Unity-based simulator and designed a mixed-traffic
intersection scenario. Moreover, several baselines were implemented to compare
with our new design, and numerical experiments were conducted to test the
performance of the HRL model. The experiments show that our HRL method can
reduce energy consumption by 12.70% and save 11.75% travel time when compared
with a state-of-the-art model-based Eco-Driving approach.

present a novel computationally efficient approach for adaptive approximation
of high-order B\'ezier curves by multiple low-order B\'ezier segments at any
desired level of accuracy that is specified in terms of a B\'ezier metric.
Accordingly, we introduce a new B\'ezier degree reduction method, called
parameterwise matching reduction, that approximates B\'ezier curves more
accurately compared to the standard least squares and Taylor reduction methods.
We also propose a new B\'ezier metric, called the maximum control-point
distance, that can be computed analytically, has a strong equivalence relation
with other existing B\'ezier metrics, and defines a geometric relative bound
between B\'ezier curves. We provide extensive numerical evidence to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed B\'ezier approximation approach. As a rule of
thumb, based on the degree-one matching reduction error, we conclude that an

during the thermal analysis and the geometric design of cryogenic heat
exchangers. However, current methods to predict the pressure drop have one of
two problems: lack of accuracy or generalization to different situations. In
this work, we present the correlated-informed neural networks (CoINN), a new
paradigm in applying the artificial neural network (ANN) technique combined
with a successful pressure drop correlation as a mapping tool to predict the
pressure drop of zeotropic mixtures in micro-channels. The proposed approach is
inspired by Transfer Learning, highly used in deep learning problems with
reduced datasets. Our method improves the ANN performance by transferring the
knowledge of the Sun & Mishima correlation for the pressure drop to the ANN.
The correlation having physical and phenomenological implications for the
pressure drop in micro-channels considerably improves the performance and
generalization capabilities of the ANN. The final architecture consists of
three inputs: the mixture vapor quality, the micro-channel inner diameter, and
the available pressure drop correlation. The results show the benefits gained
using the correlated-informed approach predicting experimental data used for
training and a posterior test with a mean relative error (mre) of 6%, lower
than the Sun & Mishima correlation of 13%. Additionally, this approach can be
extended to other mixtures and experimental settings, a missing feature in
other approaches for mapping correlations using ANNs for heat transfer
applications.

debate. We present Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of 18
optically selected local Brightest Group Galaxies (BGGs) to study the
kinematics and distribution of the optical emission-line gas. MUSE observations
reveal a distribution of gas morphologies including ten complex networks of
filaments extending up to 10 kpc to two compact (<3 kpc) and five extended (>5
kpc) disk-dominated structures. Some rotating disks show rings and elongated
structures arising from the central disk. The kinematics of the stellar
component is mainly rotation-dominated, which is very different from the
disturbed kinematics and distribution found in the filamentary sources. The
ionized gas is kinematically decoupled from the stellar component for most
systems, suggesting an external origin for the gas. We also find that the
Halpha luminosity correlates with the cold molecular mass. By exploring the
thermodynamical properties of the hot atmospheres, we find that the filamentary
sources and compact disks are found in systems with small central entropy
values and tcool/teddy ratios. This suggests that, like for Brightest Cluster
Galaxies in cool core clusters, the ionized gas are likely formed from hot halo
gas condensations, consistently with the Chaotic Cold Accretion simulations (as
shown via the C-ratio, Tat, and k-plot). We note that gaseous rotating disks
are more frequent than in BCGs. An explanation for the origin of the gas in
those objects is a contribution to gas fueling by mergers or group satellites,
as qualitatively hinted by some sources of the present sample. Nonetheless, we
discuss the possibility that some extended disks could also be a transition
stage in an evolutionary sequence including filaments, extended disks and
compact disks, as described by hot gas condensation models of cooling flows.

of eigenvalue statistics of systems with discrete spectra, and thus serves as a
proxy for quantum chaoticity. This work presents an analytical calculation of
the SFF of the Chern-Simons Matrix Model (CSMM), which was first introduced to
describe the intermediate level statistics of disordered electrons at the
mobility edge. The CSMM is characterized by a parameter $ 0 \leq q\leq 1$,
where the Circular Unitary Ensemble (CUE) is recovered for $q\to 0$. The CSMM
was later found as a matrix model description of $U(N)$ Chern-Simons theory on
$S^3$, which is dual to a topological string theory characterized by string
coupling $g_s=-\log q$. The spectral form factor is proportional to a colored
HOMFLY invariant of a $(2n,2)$-torus link with its two components carrying the
fundamental and antifundamental representations, respectively. We check that
taking $N \to \infty$ whilst keeping $q<1$ reduces the connected SFF to an
exact linear ramp of unit slope, confirming the main result from
arXiv:2012.11703 for the specific case of the CSMM. We then consider the `t
Hooft limit, where $N \to \infty$ and $q \to 1^-$ such that $y = q^N $ remains
finite. As we take $q\to 1^-$, this constitutes the opposite extreme of the CUE
limit. In the `t Hooft limit, the connected SFF turns into a remarkable
sequence of polynomials which, as far as the authors are aware, have not
appeared in the literature thus far. A gap opens in the spectrum and, after
unfolding by a constant rescaling, the connected SFF approximates a linear ramp
of unit slope for all $y$ except $y \approx 1$, where the connected SFF goes to
zero. We thus find that, although the CSMM was introduced to describe
intermediate statistics and the `t Hooft limit is the opposite limit of the
CUE, we still recover Wigner-Dyson universality for all $y$ except $y\approx
1$.

coherent circulating motion of their electrons, which in turn, gives rise to
strong optically induced magnetization - a phenomenon known as the inverse
Faraday effect (IFE). In this study we report how the IFE also significantly
decreases plasmon damping. By modulating the optical polarization state
incident on achiral plasmonic nanostructures from linear to circular, we
observe reversible increases of reflectance by 78% as well as simultaneous
increases of optical field concentration by 35.7% under 10^9 W/m^2 continuous
wave (CW) optical excitation. These signatures of decreased plasmon damping
were also monitored in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field
(0.2 T). The combined interactions allow an estimate of the light-induced
magnetization, which corresponds to an effective magnetic field of ~1.3 T
during circularly polarized CW excitation (10^9 W/m^2). We rationalize the
observed decreases in plasmon damping in terms of the Lorentz forces acting on
the circulating electron trajectories. Our results outline strategies for
actively modulating intrinsic losses in the metal, and thereby, the optical
mode quality and field concentration via opto-magnetic effects encoded in the
polarization state of incident light.

achieve a very low rate of 32/864. This paper shows that optimizing the CRC
length improves the $E_b/N_0$ performance of this polar code, where $E_b/N_0$
is the ratio of the energy per data bit to the noise power spectral density.
Furthermore, even better $E_b/N_0$ performance is achieved by replacing the
polar code with a tail-biting convolutional code (TBCC) with a
distance-spectrum-optimal (DSO) CRC. This paper identifies the optimal CRC
length to minimize the frame error rate (FER) of a rate-1/5 TBCC at a specific
value of $E_b/N_0$. We also show that this optimized TBCC/CRC can attain the
same excellent $E_b/N_0$ performance with the very low rate of 32/864 of the 5G
polar code, where the low rate is achieved through repetition. We show that the
proposed TBCC/CRC concatenated code outperforms the PBCH polar code described
in the 5G standard both in terms of FER and decoding run time. We also explore
the tradeoff between undetected error rate and erasure rate as the CRC size

in GCR intensities for all sectors of the >=211 MeV count rate (CH31) at the V1

demonstrated systematic episodes of intensity decrease for particles around

height analyzer (PHA) data from >=211 MeV channel together with lower energy
LECP channels. Our analysis shows that while GCR anisotropies are present over
a wide range of energies, there is a decreasing trend in the amplitude of
second-order anisotropy with increasing energy during anisotropy episodes. A
stronger pitch-angle scattering at the higher velocities is argued as a
potential cause for this energy dependence. A possible cause for this velocity
dependence arising from weak rigidity dependence of the scattering mean free
path and resulting velocity-dominated scattering rate is discussed. This
interpretation is consistent with a recently reported lack of corresponding GCR
electron anisotropies.

formulate and investigate a model of a superconducting junction that combines
the electron propagation in a quantum channel with an arbitrary transmission,
and that through a localized state. Interesting situation occurs if the energy
of the localized state is close to Fermi level, that is, the state is in
resonant tunnelling regime. Since this energy is affected by the gate voltage,
we expect a drastic modification of transport properties of the junction in a
narrow interval of the gate voltages where the energy distance to Fermi level
is of the order of $\Gamma, \Delta$, $\Gamma$ being the energy broadening of
the localized state, $\Delta$ being the superconducting energy gap.
  We consider the model neglecting the interaction in the localized state, as
well as accounting for the interaction in a simplistic mean-field approach
where it manifests itself as a spin-splitting. This spin splitting is also
contributed by external magnetic field. We also take into account the
spin-orbit interaction that can be significant in realistic experimental
circumstances.
  In normal state, we find that the model may describe both peak and dip in the
transmission at resonant gate voltage. Spin splitting splits the positions of
these peculiarities. Fano interference of the transmission amplitudes results
in an asymmetric shape of the peaks/dips. In superconducting state, the spin
splitting results in a complex dependence of the superconducting current on the
superconducting phase. In several cases, this is manifested as a pair of $0 -
\pi$ transitions in the narrow interval of gate voltages.

day, numerous model interpretation and comparison solutions have also been
introduced. For example, LIME and SHAP can interpret what input features

However, few works can interpret the contribution of a data feature to a
classifier in comparison with its contribution to another classifier. This
comparative interpretation can help to disclose the fundamental difference
between two classifiers, select classifiers in different feature conditions,
and better ensemble two classifiers. To accomplish it, we propose a
learning-from-disagreement (LFD) framework to visually compare two
classification models. Specifically, LFD identifies data instances with
disagreed predictions from two compared classifiers and trains a discriminator
to learn from the disagreed instances. As the two classifiers' training
features may not be available, we train the discriminator through a set of
meta-features proposed based on certain hypotheses of the classifiers to probe
their behaviors. Interpreting the trained discriminator with the SHAP values of
different meta-features, we provide actionable insights into the compared
classifiers. Also, we introduce multiple metrics to profile the importance of
meta-features from different perspectives. With these metrics, one can easily
identify meta-features with the most complementary behaviors in two

binary classification models in the financial services and advertising industry

or triple resonance, which is the excitation of one or both electric and
magnetic plasmons within radiofrequency range and the simultaneous excitation
of the particle's acoustic mode. Given that electromagnetic pulses are
restricted to nanosecond pulse widths and MHz frequencies, the proposed method
overcomes the poor penetration in tissues and reduces thermal damage, thereby
offering a noninvasive technique of theragnosis. Moreover, the resonant
pressure obtained lasts longer than with conventional photoacoustic pressure,
providing a central feature to enhance detection. To fully comprehend the
multi-resonance framework, we develop a complete photoacoustic solution. The
proposed approach could pave the way to thermoacoustic imaging and manipulation
methods for sensitive materials and tissues with micrometer resolution.

transferring energy from the ash to the wave. Intriguingly, it has been
proposed that the extraction of this charged ash could create a radial electric
field, efficiently driving ExB rotation. However, existing theories ignore the
response of the nonresonant particles, which play a critical role in enforcing
momentum conservation in quasilinear theory. Because cross-field charge
transport and momentum conservation are fundamentally linked, this
non-consistency throws the whole effect into question. Here, we review recent
developments that have largely resolved this question of rotation drive by
alpha channeling. We build a simple, general, self-consistent quasilinear
theory for electrostatic waves, applicable to classic examples such as the
bump-on-tail instability. As an immediate consequence, we show how waves can
drive currents in the absence of momentum injection even in a collisionless
plasma. To apply this theory to the problem of ash extraction and rotation
drive, we develop the first linear theory able to capture the alpha channeling
process. The resulting momentum-conserving linear-quasilinear theory reveals a
fundamental difference between the reaction of nonresonant particles to plane
waves that grow in time, versus steady-state waves that have nonuniform spatial
structure, allowing rotation drive in the latter case while precluding it in
the former. This difference can be understood through two conservation laws,
which demonstrate the local and global momentum conservation of the theory.
Finally, we show how the oscillation-center theories often obscure the
time-dependent nonresonant recoil, but ultimately lead to similar results.

data for the cuprate high-temperature superconductors showed that the data can
be understood with a simple spin susceptibility from a metallic density of
states common to all cuprates. It carries a doping dependent but temperature
independent pseudogap at the Fermi surface, which causes the deviations from
normal metallic behavior, also in the specific heat. Here, a more coherent,
unbiased assessment of all data, including planar Cu, is presented and
consequences are discussed, since the planar Cu data were collected and
analyzed prior to the O data. The main finding is that the planar Cu shifts for
one direction of the external magnetic field largely follow from the same
states and pseudogap. This explains the shift suppression stated more recently,
which leads to the failure of the Korringa relation in contrast to an
enhancement of the relaxation due to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations
originally proposed. However, there is still the need for a second spin
component that appears to be associated with the Cu $3d(x^2-y^2)$ hole to
explain the complex Cu shift anisotropy and family dependence. Furthermore, it
is argued that the planar Cu relaxation which was reported recently to be
rather ubiquitous for the cuprates, must be related to this universal density
of states and the second spin component, while not being affected by the simple
pseudogap. Thus, while this universal metallic density of states with a
pseudogap is also found in the planar Cu data, there is still need for a more
elaborate scenario that eludes planar O.

Beyond just a few layers, two fundamental challenges emerge: 1. degraded
expressivity due to oversmoothing, and 2. expensive computation due to

scope of GNNs -- to generate representation of a target entity (i.e., a node or
an edge), we first extract a localized subgraph as the bounded-size scope, and
then apply a GNN of arbitrary depth on top of the subgraph. A properly
extracted subgraph consists of a small number of critical neighbors, while
excluding irrelevant ones. The GNN, no matter how deep it is, smooths the local
neighborhood into informative representation rather than oversmoothing the
global graph into ""white noise"". Theoretically, decoupling improves the GNN
expressive power from the perspectives of graph signal processing (GCN),
function approximation (GraphSAGE) and topological learning (GIN). Empirically,
on seven graphs (with up to 110M nodes) and six backbone GNN architectures, our
design achieves significant accuracy improvement with orders of magnitude

throughput of conventional SM schemes by transmitting higher order complex
modulation symbol, which is decomposed into three different parts. These parts
carry the amplitude, phase, and quadrant components of the complex symbol,
which are then represented by unipolar pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)
symbols. Superposition coding is exploited to allocate a fraction of the total
power to each part before they are all multiplexed and transmitted
simultaneously, exploiting the entire available bandwidth. At the receiver, a
two-step decoding process is proposed to decode the active light emitting diode
index before the complex symbol is retrieved. It is shown that at higher
spectral efficiency values, the proposed modulation scheme outperforms
conventional SM schemes with PAM symbols in terms of average symbol error rate
(ASER), and hence, enhancing the system throughput. Furthermore, since the
performance of the proposed modulation scheme is sensitive to the power
allocation factors, we formulated an ASER optimization problem and propose a
sub-optimal solution using successive convex programming (SCP). Notably, the
proposed algorithm converges after only few iterations, whilst the performance
with the optimized power allocation coefficients outperforms both random and

methods for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data have
come under scrutiny, with studies questioning cross-software comparability, the
validity of statistical inference and interpretation, and the influence of the
spatial filter size on neuroimaging analyses. As most fMRI studies only use a
single filter for analysis, much information on the size and shape of the BOLD
signal in Gaussian scale space remains hidden and constrains the interpretation
of fMRI studies. To investigate the influence of the spatial observation scale
on fMRI analysis, we use a spatial multiscale analysis with a range of Gaussian
filters from 1-20 mm (full width at half maximum) to analyze fMRI data from a
speech repetition paradigm in 25 healthy subjects. We show that analyzing the
fMRI data over a range of Gaussian filter kernels reveals substantial
variability in the neuroanatomical localization and the average signal strength
and size of suprathreshold clusters depending on the filter size. We also
demonstrate how small spatial filters bias the results towards subcortical and
cerebellar clusters. Furthermore, we describe substantially different
scale-dependent cluster size dynamics between cortical and cerebellar clusters.
We discuss how spatial multiscale analysis may substantially improve the
interpretation of fMRI data. We propose to further develop a spatial multiscale
analysis to fully explore the deep structure of the BOLD signal in Gaussian

radio telescope operating across the 400-800 MHz band. CHIME is located at the
Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory near Penticton, BC Canada. The
instrument is designed to map neutral hydrogen over the redshift range 0.8 to
2.5 to constrain the expansion history of the Universe. This goal drives the
design features of the instrument. CHIME consists of four parallel cylindrical
reflectors, oriented north-south, each 100 m $\times$ 20 m and outfitted with a
256 element dual-polarization linear feed array. CHIME observes a two degree
wide stripe covering the entire meridian at any given moment, observing 3/4 of
the sky every day due to Earth rotation. An FX correlator utilizes FPGAs and
GPUs to digitize and correlate the signals, with different correlation products
generated for cosmological, fast radio burst, pulsar, VLBI, and 21 cm absorber
backends. For the cosmology backend, the $N_\mathrm{feed}^2$ correlation matrix
is formed for 1024 frequency channels across the band every 31 ms. A data
receiver system applies calibration and flagging and, for our primary
cosmological data product, stacks redundant baselines and integrates for 10 s.
We present an overview of the instrument, its performance metrics based on the
first three years of science data, and we describe the current progress in
characterizing CHIME's primary beam response. We also present maps of the sky
derived from CHIME data; we are using versions of these maps for a cosmological
stacking analysis as well as for investigation of Galactic foregrounds.

contemporary data, a material pseudovector diquark component in the proton is

and a modest Pauli blocking effect in the gluon splitting function is
sufficient to explain the proton's light-quark antimatter asymmetry. In
comparison with pion DFs, the light-front momentum fractions carried by all

are different. Understanding these features may provide insights that explain
distinctions between Nambu-Goldstone bosons and seemingly less complex hadrons.

dipole moment. The precision of this measurement can be improved by direct
laser cooling of the molecules to ultracold temperature. However, low-lying
electronic states arising from excitation of a 4f electron may hinder laser
cooling. One set of these ""4f hole"" states lies below the $A^2\Pi_{1/2}$
excited state used for laser cooling, and radiative decay to these intermediate
levels, even with branching ratios as small as $10^{-5}$, can be a hindrance.
Other 4f hole states lie very close to the $A^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state, and a
perturbation results in states of mixed character that are involved in the
laser cooling cycle. This perturbation may enhance the loss of molecules to
states outside of the laser cooling cycle. We model the perturbation of the
$A^2\Pi_{1/2}$ state to determine the strength of the coupling between the
states, the de-perturbed potential energy curves, and the radiative branching
ratios to various vibrational levels of the ground state, $X ^{2}\Sigma^+$. We
use electronic structure calculations to characterise the 4f hole states and
the strengths of transitions between these states and the $A^2\Pi_{1/2}$ and $X

branching ratio of roughly $5 \times 10^{-4}$, dominated by the contribution of
the ground state configuration in a 4f hole state. Finally, we assess the
impact of these results for laser cooling of YbF and molecules with similar

three-dimensional Fermi sea of fermions at finite temperature, by using the
standard non-self-consistent many-body $T$-matrix theory that is equivalent to
a finite-temperature variational approach with the inclusion of
one-particle-hole excitation. The impurity spectral function is determined in
the real-frequency domain, avoiding any potential errors due to the numerical
analytic continuation in previous $T$-matrix calculations and the small
spectral broadening parameter used in variational calculations. In the
weak-coupling limit, we find that the quasiparticle decay rate of both
attractive and repulsive polarons does not increase significantly with
increasing temperature, and therefore Fermi polarons may remain well-defined
far above Fermi degeneracy. In contrast, near the unitary limit with strong
coupling, the decay rate of Fermi polarons rapidly increase and the
quasiparticle picture breaks down close to the Fermi temperature. We analyze in
detail the recent ejection and injection radio-frequency (rf) spectroscopy
measurements, performed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and at
European Laboratory for Non-Linear Spectroscopy (LENS), respectively. We show
that the momentum average of the spectral function, which is necessary to
account for the observed rf-spectroscopy, has a sizable contribution to the
width of the quasiparticle peak in spectroscopy. As a result, the measured
decay rate of Fermi polarons could be significantly larger than the calculated
quasiparticle decay rate at zero momentum. By take this crucial contribution
into account, we find that there is a reasonable agreement between theory and
experiment for the lifetime of Fermi polarons in the strong-coupling regime, as
long as they remain well-defined.

access points (APs) can collaboratively conduct transmitter beamforming to
provide data services (e.g., eMBB or URLLC). The collaboration between APs
effectively forms a networked linear antenna-array with extra-large aperture
(i.e., network-ELAA), where the wireless channel exhibits spatial
nonstationarity. Major contribution of this work lies in the analysis of
beamforming gain and radio coverage for network-ELAA non-stationary Rician
channels considering the AP clustering. Assuming that: 1) the total
transmit-power is fixed and evenly distributed over APs, 2) the beam is formed
only based on the line-of-sight (LoS) path, it is found that the beamforming
gain is concave to the cluster size. The optimum size of the AP cluster varies
with respect to the user's location, channel uncertainty as well as data
services. A user located farther from the ELAA requires a larger cluster size.
URLLC is more sensitive to the channel uncertainty when comparing to eMBB, thus
requiring a larger cluster size to mitigate the channel fading effect and
extend the coverage. Finally, it is shown that the network-ELAA can offer
significant coverage extension (50% or more in most of cases) when comparing

problem. The externalization of valence in speech has speaker-dependent cues,
which contribute to performances that are often significantly lower than the
prediction of other emotional attributes such as arousal and dominance. A
practical approach to improve valence prediction from speech is to adapt the
models to the target speakers in the test set. Adapting a speech emotion
recognition (SER) system to a particular speaker is a hard problem, especially
with deep neural networks (DNNs), since it requires optimizing millions of
parameters. This study proposes an unsupervised approach to address this
problem by searching for speakers in the train set with similar acoustic
patterns as the speaker in the test set. Speech samples from the selected
speakers are used to create the adaptation set. This approach leverages
transfer learning using pre-trained models, which are adapted with these speech
samples. We propose three alternative adaptation strategies: unique speaker,
oversampling and weighting approaches. These methods differ on the use of the
adaptation set in the personalization of the valence models. The results
demonstrate that a valence prediction model can be efficiently personalized
with these unsupervised approaches, leading to relative improvements as high as
13.52%.

interpretation as a particular random walk, also viewed as a discrete time and
discrete space heat diffusion, so then the sum in question is related to
special values of the associated heat kernel. Our evaluation follows by
deriving a combinatorial expression for the heat kernel, which is obtained by
periodizing the heat kernel on the infinite lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$ which
covers $G_{\mathbf{m}}$.

channel that allows conversion of thermal energy of NIS to kinetic energy of
IS, a flow of heat from the outer to the inner core of the track structure. We
demonstrate the coexistence of ""hot"" NIS with ""cold"" IS in the radiation track
structures right after their generation. NIS, concentrated within nano-scales
volumes wrapping around IS, are the main source of intensive heat-waves and the
outward burst of IS due to femto-second time scale IS-NIS coupling. By
comparing the transport of IS coupled to NIS with identical configurations of
non-interacting IS in thermal equilibrium at room temperature, we demonstrate
that the energy gain of IS due to the surrounding hot nanoscopic volumes of NIS
significantly increases their effective diffusion constants. The much higher

re-training a network is rarely cheap and not always viable. To this end, we

enhance the performance of pre-trained models -- which commonly ship as a
package with deep learning platforms \eg, PyTorch. Specifically, we demonstrate
that running inference on the center crop of an image is not always the best as
important discriminatory information may be cropped-off. Instead we propose to
combine results for multiple random crops for a test image. This not only
matches the train time augmentation but also provides the full coverage of the
input image. We explore combining representation of random crops through
averaging at different levels \ie, deep feature level, logit level, and softmax
level. We demonstrate that, for various families of modern deep networks, such
averaging results in better validation accuracy compared to using a single
central crop per image. The softmax averaging results in the best performance
for various pre-trained networks without requiring any re-training or
fine-tuning whatsoever. On modern GPUs with batch processing, the paper's
approach to inference of pre-trained networks, is essentially free as all

accelerator R&D for the next five to ten years, covering five topical areas
identified in the Strategy update. The R&D objectives include: improvement of
the performance and cost-performance of magnet and radio-frequency acceleration
systems; investigations of the potential of laser / plasma acceleration and
energy-recovery linac techniques; and development of new concepts for muon

mass loss. The rate of meltwater production from glacier ice is especially
sensitive to its physical structure and chemical composition which combine to
determine the albedo of glacier ice. However, the optical properties of
near-surface glacier ice are not well known since most prior work has focused
on ice made in the laboratory or from deep cores. Here, we demonstrate a
measurement technique based on diffuse propagation of nanosecond-duration laser
pulses in near-surface glacier ice that enables the independent measurement of
the scattering and absorption coefficients, allowing for a complete description
of the processes governing radiative transfer. We employ a photon-counting
detector to overcome the high losses associated with diffuse optics. The
instrument is highly portable and rugged, making it optimally suited for
deployment in remote regions. A set of measurements taken on Collier Glacier,
Oregon, serves as a demonstration of the technique. These measurements provide
insight into both physical structure and composition of near-surface glacier
ice and open new avenues for the analysis of light-absorbing impurities and
remote sensing of the cryosphere.

reducing the computational error of variational quantum algorithms. In general,
the computational error reduction comes at the cost of a sampling overhead due
to the variance-boosting effect caused by the channel inversion operation,
which ultimately limits the applicability of QEM. Existing sampling overhead
analysis of QEM typically assumes exact channel inversion, which is unrealistic
in practical scenarios. In this treatise, we consider a practical channel
inversion strategy based on Monte Carlo sampling, which introduces additional
computational error that in turn may be eliminated at the cost of an extra
sampling overhead. In particular, we show that when the computational error is
small compared to the dynamic range of the error-free results, it scales with
the square root of the number of gates. By contrast, the error exhibits a
linear scaling with the number of gates in the absence of QEM under the same
assumptions. Hence, the error scaling of QEM remains to be preferable even
without the extra sampling overhead. Our analytical results are accompanied by

Theory (MCT), a quantitative framework for understanding ecological
coexistence. In order to use MCT to infer how species are coexisting, one must
relate a complex model (which simulates coexistence in the real world) to
simple models in which previously proposed explanations for coexistence have
been codified. This can be accomplished in three steps: 1) relating the
construct of coexistence to invasion growth rates, 2) mathematically
partitioning the invasion growth rates into coexistence mechanisms (i.e.,
classes of explanations for coexistence), and 3) relating coexistence
mechanisms to simple explanations for coexistence. Previous research has
primarily focused on step 2. Here, we discuss the other crucial steps and their
implications for inferring the mechanisms of coexistence in real communities.
  Our discussion of step 3 -- relating coexistence mechanisms to simple
explanations for coexistence -- serves a heuristic guide for hypothesizing
about the causes of coexistence in new models; but also addresses
misconceptions about coexistence mechanisms. For example, the storage effect
has little to do with bet-hedging or ""storage"" via a robust life-history stage;
relative nonlinearity is more likely to promote coexistence than originally
thought; and fitness-density covariance is an amalgam of a large number of
previously proposed explanations for coexistence (e.g., the
competition-colonization trade-off, heteromyopia, spatially-varying resource
supply ratios). Additionally, we review a number of topics in MCT, including
the role of ""scaling factors""; whether coexistence mechanisms are
approximations; whether the magnitude or sign of invasion growth rates matters
more; whether Hutchinson solved the paradox of the plankton; the
scale-dependence of coexistence mechanisms; and much more.

the potential workspace size, as motion is subject to the hand's kinematic
topology. Finger gaiting is one way to alleviate such restraints. It allows
contacts to be freely broken and remade so as to operate on different
manipulation manifolds. This capability, however, has traditionally been
difficult or impossible to practically realize. A finger gaiting system must
simultaneously plan for and control forces on the object while maintaining
stability during contact switching. This work alleviates the traditional
requirement by taking advantage of system compliance, allowing the hand to more
easily switch contacts while maintaining a stable grasp. Our method achieves
complete SO(3) finger gaiting control of grasped objects against gravity by
developing a manipulation planner that operates via orthogonal safe modes of a
compliant, underactuated hand absent of tactile sensors or joint encoders.
During manipulation, a low-latency 6D pose object tracker provides feedback via
vision, allowing the planner to update its plan online so as to adaptively
recover from trajectory deviations. The efficacy of this method is showcased by
manipulating both convex and non-convex objects on a real robot. Its robustness
is evaluated via perturbation rejection and long trajectory goals. To the best
of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that has autonomously
achieved full SO(3) control of objects within-hand via finger gaiting and
without a support surface, elucidating a valuable step towards realizing true
robot in-hand manipulation capabilities.

Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) play a major role in achieving high
multiplication gain by delivering light near the multiplication region where
the electric field is the strongest. Such control in the penetration depth for
a particular wavelength of light has been previously demonstrated using
integrated photon-trapping nanostructures. In this paper, we show that an
optimized periodic nanostructure design can control the penetration depth for a
wide range of visible and near-infrared wavelengths simultaneously. A
conventional silicon APD structure suffers from high photocarrier loss due to
recombination for shorter wavelengths as they are absorbed near the surface
region, while silicon has low absorption efficiency for longer wavelengths.
This optimized nanostructure design allows shorter wavelengths of light to
penetrate deeper into the device, circumventing recombination sites while
trapping the longer wavelengths in the thin silicon device by bending the
vertically propagating light into horizontal modes. This manipulation of
penetration depth improves the absorption in the device, increasing light

While delivery of light near the multiplication region reduces the
photogenerated carrier loss and shortens transit time, leading to high
multiplication gain in APDs and SPADs over a wide spectral range. These high
gain APDs and SPADs will find their potential applications in Time-Of-Flight
Positron Emission Tomography (TOF-PET), Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging

proposes a fusion learning scheme by exploiting the bi-directional channel
reciprocity. Specifically, a simplified version of the conventional downlink
CSI reconstruction is utilized to extract the initial feature of downlink CSI,
and a single hidden layer-based amplitude-learning network (AMPL-NET) is
designed to learn the auxiliary feature of the downlink CSI amplitude. Then,
based on the extracted and learned amplitude features, a simple but effective
amplitude-fusion network (AMPF-NET) is developed to perform the amplitude
fusion of downlink CSI and thus improves the reconstruction accuracy for 1-bit
CS-based superimposed CSI feedback while reducing the processing delay.
Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed feedback scheme and
the robustness against parameter variations.

an object from a given category hierarchy via several rounds of interactive
queries. In each round of query, the search algorithm picks a category and
receives a boolean answer on whether the object is under the chosen category.
The main efficiency goal asks for the minimum number of queries to identify the
correct hierarchical category for the object. In this paper, we study the
average-case interactive graph search (AIGS) problem that aims to minimize the
expected number of queries when the objects follow a probability distribution.
We propose a greedy search policy that splits the candidate categories as
evenly as possible with respect to the probability weights, which offers an
approximation guarantee of $O(\log n)$ for AIGS given the category hierarchy is
a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where $n$ is the total number of categories.
Meanwhile, if the input hierarchy is a tree, we show that a constant
approximation factor of $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ can be achieved. Furthermore, we
present efficient implementations of the greedy policy, namely GreedyTree and
GreedyDAG, that can quickly categorize the object in practice. Extensive
experiments in real-world scenarios are carried out to demonstrate the

semi-supervised node classification on graphs. Nevertheless, the challenge of
how to effectively learn GNNs with very few labels is still under-explored. As
one of the prevalent semi-supervised methods, pseudo-labeling has been proposed
to explicitly address the label scarcity problem. It aims to augment the
training set with pseudo-labeled unlabeled nodes with high confidence so as to
re-train a supervised model in a self-training cycle. However, the existing
pseudo-labeling approaches often suffer from two major drawbacks. First, they
tend to conservatively expand the label set by selecting only high-confidence
unlabeled nodes without assessing their informativeness. Unfortunately, those
high-confidence nodes often convey overlapping information with given labels,
leading to minor improvements for model re-training. Second, these methods
incorporate pseudo-labels to the same loss function with genuine labels,
ignoring their distinct contributions to the classification task. In this
paper, we propose a novel informative pseudo-labeling framework, called
InfoGNN, to facilitate learning of GNNs with extremely few labels. Our key idea
is to pseudo label the most informative nodes that can maximally represent the
local neighborhoods via mutual information maximization. To mitigate the
potential label noise and class-imbalance problem arising from pseudo labeling,
we also carefully devise a generalized cross entropy loss with a class-balanced
regularization to incorporate generated pseudo labels into model re-training.
Extensive experiments on six real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
strong self-supervised methods on graphs.

or kaons has been an important goal of heavy-ion physics, and substantial
effort has been made in order to understand the underlying physics behind the
experimental observations of non-Gaussian behavior. In experiments, since no
direct measurement of the source function is possible, quantum-statistical
momentum correlations are utilized to gain information about the space-time
geometry of the particle emitting source. Event generators, such as EPOS,
however, provide direct access to the freeze-out coordinates of final state
particles, and thus the source function can be constructed and investigated.
The EPOS model is a sophisticated hybrid model where the initial stage
evolution of the system is governed by Parton-Based Gribov-Regge theory, and
subsequently a hydrodynamic evolution is utilized, followed by hadronization
and hadron dynamics. EPOS has already proven to be successful in describing
several different experimental observations for systems characterized by baryon
chemical potential close to zero, but so far the source shape has not been
explored in detail. In this paper we discuss an event-by-event analysis of the
two-particle source function in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions
generated by the EPOS model. We find that when utilizing all stages of the
model, L\'evy-shaped distributions (unlike Gaussian distributions) provide a
good description of the source shape in the individual events. Hence it is
clear that it is not the event averaging that creates the non-Gaussian features
in the pair distributions. Based on this observation, we determine
L\'evy-parameters of the source as a function of event centrality and particle
momentum.

Targeting the central molecular zone (CMZ), we test this approach by applying
the VGT to $\rm ^{12}CO$ and $\rm ^{13}CO$ (J = 1-0) data cubes. We first used
the SCOUSEPY algorithm to decompose the CO line emissions into separate

the decomposed magnetic field maps and investigate their significance. While
the line-of-sight integrated magnetic field orientation is shown to be
consistent with the polarized dust emission from the Planck survey at 353 GHz,
individual velocity components may exhibit different magnetic fields. We
present a scheme of magnetic field configuration in the CMZ based on the

magnetic field orientation in the dense clump near the Sgr B2 and a change in
the outflow regions around the Sgr A*. Two high-velocity structures associated

representation learning framework and has shown comparable performance with
supervised approaches. However, evaluating whether the graph contrastive
learning is robust to adversarial attacks is still an open problem because most
existing graph adversarial attacks are supervised models, which means they
heavily rely on labels and can only be used to evaluate the graph contrastive
learning in a specific scenario. For unsupervised graph representation methods
such as graph contrastive learning, it is difficult to acquire labels in
real-world scenarios, making traditional supervised graph attack methods
difficult to be applied to test their robustness. In this paper, we propose a
novel unsupervised gradient-based adversarial attack that does not rely on
labels for graph contrastive learning. We compute the gradients of the
adjacency matrices of the two views and flip the edges with gradient ascent to
maximize the contrastive loss. In this way, we can fully use multiple views
generated by the graph contrastive learning models and pick the most
informative edges without knowing their labels, and therefore can promisingly
support our model adapted to more kinds of downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments show that our attack outperforms unsupervised baseline attacks and
has comparable performance with supervised attacks in multiple downstream tasks
including node classification and link prediction. We further show that our
attack can be transferred to other graph representation models as well.

propose read safe snapshot (RSS) using multiversion CC (MVCC) theory and
introduce the RSS construction algorithm utilizing serializable snapshot
isolation (SSI). For serializability of HTAP systems, our model makes use of
multiversion and allows more schedules with read operations whose corresponding
write operations do not participate in the dependency cycles. Furthermore, we
implemented the algorithm practically in an open-source database system that
offers SSI. Our algorithm was integrated into two types of architecture as HTAP
systems called as unified (single-node) or decoupled (multinode) storage
architecture. We evaluate the performance and abort rate of the single-node
architecture where SSI is applicable. The multi-node architecture was
investigated for examining the performance overhead applying our algorithm.

aspects: it is not robust against interaction, but persists in the presence of
slowly varying perturbations. Such a sliding localized phase can be understood
as a consequence of interference between the wavepacket paths under moving
quasi-periodic potentials with various periods that are incommensurate with the

plant root images captured by MR technology. In total, there are over 72K RGB
root images across six different species including cotton, papaya, peanut,

image-level labels can be used to support weakly supervised learning in plant
root segmentation tasks. In addition, 63K images have been manually annotated
to generate pixel-level binary masks indicating whether each pixel corresponds
to root or not. These pixel-level binary masks can be used as ground truth for
supervised learning in semantic segmentation tasks. By introducing this

relations. In this paper, we introduce simplicial patterns -- that we call
simplets -- and generalize the task of frequent pattern mining from the realm
of graphs to that of simplicial complexes. Our task is particularly challenging
due to the enormous search space and the need for higher-order isomorphism. We
show that finding the occurrences of simplets in a complex can be reduced to a
bipartite graph isomorphism problem, in linear time and at most quadratic
space. We then propose an anti-monotonic frequency measure that allows us to
start the exploration from small simplets and stop expanding a simplet as soon
as its frequency falls below the minimum frequency threshold. Equipped with
these ideas and a clever data structure, we develop a memory-conscious
algorithm that, by carefully exploiting the relationships among the simplices
in the complex and among the simplets, achieves efficiency and scalability for
our complex mining task. Our algorithm, FreSCo, comes in two flavors: it can
compute the exact frequency of the simplets or, more quickly, it can determine
whether a simplet is frequent, without having to compute the exact frequency.
Experimental results prove the ability of FreSCo to mine frequent simplets in
complexes of various size and dimension, and the significance of the simplets
with respect to the traditional graph patterns.

pressures. Beyond this symptom, the root causes of the problem are rarely
investigated. In this work, it is identified that these shortcomings are caused
by (i) an inconsistent treatment of the SGTE method of extrapolation, and (ii)
an insufficient knowledge of the models to describe the volume that are the key
to extend CALPHAD databases toward high pressures. Because the first step
toward solving the problem is to focus on the later issue, several models to
describe the volume that are built upon the Grover empirical law are
investigated, namely, the Lu-Grover, Joubert-Lu-Grover, Jacobs-Grover, and the
Anand-Saxena-Grover approaches. In addition, an original description built upon
the concept of thermal pressure, and a new scheme based on the equivalence

effect, the ATE of the target population can be different from that of the
source population when distributions of treatment effect modifiers are
dissimilar in these two populations, a phenomenon also known as covariate
shift. Many methods have been developed to adjust for covariate shift, but most
require individual covariates from a representative target sample. We develop a
weighting approach based on summary-level information from the target sample to
adjust for possible covariate shift in effect modifiers. In particular, weights

failure probability is usually used instead of safety factors. In the
technique, it should not be less than a predetermined value. Choosing the
proper design criterion is a challenging problem for designers who are dealing
with the technique, particularly, when there are various criteria. One of these
kinds of products is a cylindrical pressure vessel which has diverse criteria
proposed in the literature to calculate the burst pressure as a start point of
the design. In this paper, we are going to evaluate and compare the
performances of various burst pressure criteria in estimating failure
probability which is used for a sample pressure vessel. For each criterion,
Monte Carlo simulation has been employed to calculate the probability of
failure due to variations related to major design variables. The design
parameters include material properties and operating pressure. First, the
effects of variations in standard deviations of the design variables on the
calculated burst probabilities have been determined by standard deviation
analysis. Then, sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the sensitivity
of each burst pressure criterion against changes in the magnitude of design
variables.

the objective function because they are expected to coincide when synchronized.
Using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method, the vehicle and bridge

use of neural networks for real-time sensing and detection of transmission line
faults and estimation of their locations. The expansion of power systems
including transmission lines with various lengths have made a fault detection,
classification, and location estimation process more challenging. Transmission
line datasets are stream data which are continuously collected by various
sensors and hence, require generalized and fast fault diagnosis approaches.
Newly collected datasets including voltages and currents might not have enough
and accurate labels (fault and no fault) that are useful to train neural
networks. In this paper, a novel transfer learning framework based on a
pre-trained LeNet-5 convolutional neural network is proposed. This method is
able to diagnose faults for different transmission line lengths and impedances
by transferring the knowledge from a source convolutional neural network to
predict a dissimilar target dataset. By transferring this knowledge, faults
from various transmission lines, without having enough labels, can be diagnosed
faster and more efficiently compared to the existing methods. To prove the
feasibility and effectiveness of this methodology, seven different datasets
that include various lengths of transmission lines are used. The robustness of
the proposed methodology against generator voltage fluctuation, variation in
fault distance, fault inception angle, fault resistance, and phase difference
between the two generators are well shown, thus proving its practical values in

ejections (CMEs) and play essential roles in particle accelerations. A critical
ratio, $\delta$, derived from a shock standoff distance normalized by the
radius of curvature (ROC) of a CME, allows us to estimate shock and ambient
coronal parameters. However, true ROCs of CMEs are difficult to measure due to
observed projection effects.
  Aims. We investigate the formation mechanism of a shock driven by an
aspherical CME without evident lateral expansion. Through three-dimensional
(3D) reconstructions without a priori assumptions of the object morphology, we
estimate two principal ROCs of the CME surface and demonstrate how the
difference between two principal ROCs of the CME affects the estimate of the
coronal physical parameters.
  Methods. The CME was observed by the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and
Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) instruments and the Large Angle and
Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). We used the mask-fitting method to obtain
the irregular 3D shape of the CME and reconstructed the shock surface using the
bow-shock model. Through smoothings with fifth-order polynomial functions and
Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated the ROCs at the CME nose.
  Results. We find that (1) the maximal ROC is 2-4 times the minimal ROC of the
CME. A significant difference between the CME ROCs implies that the assumption
of one ROC of an aspherical CME could cause over-/under- estimations of the
shock and coronal parameters. (2) The shock nose obeys the bow-shock formation
mechanism, considering the constant standoff distance and the similar speed
between the shock and CME around the nose. (3) With a more precise $\delta$
calculated via 3D ROCs in space, we derive corona parameters at high latitudes
of about -50$^{\circ}$, including the Alfv{\'e}n speed and the coronal magnetic
field strength.

over a network as packets, at a rate unknown to the estimator. Packets may

  Works on estimation often assume knowledge of the dynamic model of the

  The DNN estimator results in significantly smaller average estimation error
than the commonly used Time-varying Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman

emerging research topic now a days that gained attention. In the news media and
social media the information is spread highspeed but without accuracy and hence
detection mechanism should be able to predict news fast enough to tackle the
dissemination of fake news. It has the potential for negative impacts on
individuals and society. Therefore, detecting fake news on social media is
important and also a technically challenging problem these days. We knew that
Machine learning is helpful for building Artificial intelligence systems based
on tacit knowledge because it can help us to solve complex problems due to real
word data. On the other side we knew that Knowledge engineering is helpful for
representing experts knowledge which people aware of that knowledge. Due to
this we proposed that integration of Machine learning and knowledge engineering
can be helpful in detection of fake news. In this paper we present what is fake
news, importance of fake news, overall impact of fake news on different areas,
different ways to detect fake news on social media, existing detections
algorithms that can help us to overcome the issue, similar application areas
and at the end we proposed combination of data driven and engineered knowledge
to combat fake news. We studied and compared three different modules text
classifiers, stance detection applications and fact checking existing
techniques that can help to detect fake news. Furthermore, we investigated the
impact of fake news on society. Experimental evaluation of publically available
datasets and our proposed fake news detection combination can serve better in
detection of fake news.

period of V608 Cas has varied in some combination of an upward parabola and two
periodic variations. The continuous period increase with a rate of
$+$3.99$\times$10$^{-7}$ d yr$^{-1}$ can be interpreted as a mass transfer from
the secondary component to the primary star at a rate of 1.51$\times$10$^{-7}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The periods and semi-amplitudes of the two periodic
variations are about $P_3$ = 16.0 yr and $P_4$ = 26.3 yr, and $K_3$ = 0.0341 d

features in a Correlation Module (CorrM). The coarse saliency map serves as the
location guidance for low-level features. In CorrM, we mine the object location

states under different dissipative environments. When the individual modes
interact with identical local baths, entanglement and squeezing decay at the

comparative robustness of entanglement and squeezing depends on the initial
squeezing of the state. Similarly, when the system interacts with a global
bath, the robustness of entanglement and squeezing depends on the initial
squeezing. Thus depending on the nature of dissipative environments and the
initial squeezing of the state, one can select the more robust form of resource
out of squeezing and entanglement to store quantumness. This can be used to
effectively enhance the performance of various quantum information processing

to realize the geometric Langlands correspondence for these $\check{G}$-local

hypergeometric automorphic data under natural assumptions, which allows us to

literature where the eventual properties of QWRW coincide with those of QWs.
However, we consider that the unique attributes of QWRWs have not been fully

this paper, we highlight the directivity of one-dimensional discrete quantum
walks via QWRWs. By exploiting the fact that QWRW allows trajectories of
individual walkers to be considered, we first discuss the determination of
future directions of QWRWs, through which the effect of linear spreading and
localization is manifested in another way. Furthermore, the transition
probabilities of QWRWs can also be visualized and show a highly complex shape,
representing QWs in a novel way. Moreover, we discuss the first return time to
the origin between RWs and QWs, which is made possible via the notion of QWRWs.
We observe that the first return time statistics of QWs are quite different
from RWs, caused by both the linear spreading and localization properties of
QWs.

from a given probability distribution, of which the Metropolis Adjusted
Langevin Algorithm (MALA) is a variant wherein the gradient of the distribution
is used towards faster convergence. However, being set up in the Euclidean
framework, MALA might perform poorly in higher dimensional problems or in those
involving anisotropic densities as the underlying non-Euclidean aspects of the
geometry of the sample space remain unaccounted for. We make use of concepts
from differential geometry and stochastic calculus on Riemannian manifolds to
geometrically adapt a stochastic differential equation with a non-trivial drift
term. This adaptation is also referred to as a stochastic development. We apply
this method specifically to the Langevin diffusion equation and arrive at a
geometrically adapted Langevin dynamics. This new approach far outperforms
MALA, certain manifold variants of MALA, and other approaches such as
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), its adaptive variant the no-U-turn sampler

increases where often GALA is actually the only successful method. This is
evidenced through several numerical examples that include parameter estimation

the segregation of titanium out of the TiW and interdiffusion into the copper
metallisation. Titanium was shown be driven toward the free copper surface,
accumulating there and forming a titanium oxide overlayer upon exposure to air.
Annealing for longer timescales promoted a greater out-diffusion of titanium

measurements suggest that the diffusion is not significant enough to compromise
the barrier integrity and the TiW/Cu interface remains stable even after 5~h of

ionized outflow kinematics to be in line with what we measure in the neutral

outflow mass budget, there is value to collecting empirical measurements of the

Depending on dust corrections applied to the ionized gas diagnostics, the
neutral phase has $\sim 1.2 - 1.8$ dex higher mass outflow rates

scaling relations between $\dot{M}_{out}$ and the strengths of the physical

large class of kernels, including the neural tangent kernel of fully connected

regime. More surprisingly, when the data is generated by a kernel model where
the relationship between input and the response could be very nonlinear, we
show that linear models are in fact optimal, i.e. linear models achieve the
minimum risk among all models, linear or nonlinear. These results suggest that
more complex models for the data other than independent features are needed for
high-dimensional analysis.

high-quality material, a knowledge-based optimization strategy for the
synthesis process must be developed. A major problem that has not yet been
considered is the degradation of materials by etching during synthesis due to
the high growth temperatures. To address this problem, we introduce a
mathematical model that accounts for both growth and, for the first time,
etching to describe the synthesis of two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides. We consider several experimental observations that lead to a
differential equation based on several terms corresponding to different supply
mechanisms, describing the time-dependent change in flake size. By solving this
equation and fitting two independently obtained experimental data sets, we find
that the flake area is the leading term in our model. We show that the
differential equation can be solved analytically when only this term is
considered, and that this solution provides a general description of complex
growth and shrinkage phenomena. Physically, the dominance suggests that the
supply of material via the flake itself contributes most to its net growth.
This finding also implies a predominant interplay between insertion and release
of atoms and their motion in the form of a highly dynamic process within the
flake. In contrast to previous assumptions, we show that the flake edges do not
play an important role in the actual size change of the two-dimensional
transition metal dichalcogenide flakes during chemical vapour deposition.

properties of these new structures are characterised using the C2DB workflow,
and it is found that their properties can differ significantly from those of
the original unstable crystals, e.g. band gaps are opened by 0.3 eV on average.
All the crystal structures and properties are available in the C2DB. Finally,
we train a classification model on the DS data for 3295 2D materials in the
C2DB using a representation encoding the electronic structure of the crystal.
We obtain an excellent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with an
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, showing that the classification model can
drastically reduce computational efforts in high-throughput studies.

Existing methods are limited by calibrated cameras and off-line processing.
Thus, we present the first method (AirPose) to estimate human pose and shape
using images captured by multiple extrinsically uncalibrated flying cameras.
AirPose itself calibrates the cameras relative to the person instead of relying
on any pre-calibration. It uses distributed neural networks running on each UAV
that communicate viewpoint-independent information with each other about the
person (i.e., their 3D shape and articulated pose). The person's shape and pose
are parameterized using the SMPL-X body model, resulting in a compact
representation, that minimizes communication between the UAVs. The network is
trained using synthetic images of realistic virtual environments, and
fine-tuned on a small set of real images. We also introduce an
optimization-based post-processing method (AirPose$^{+}$) for offline
applications that require higher MoCap quality. We make our method's code and

important, as it could guide us to design deep neural networks (DNN) that
generalize better. However, the richness of ImageNet imposes difficulties for
researchers to visually find any useful patterns of misclassification. Here, to
help find these patterns, we propose ""Superclassing ImageNet dataset"". It is a
subset of ImageNet which consists of 10 superclasses, each containing 7-116
related subclasses (e.g., 52 bird types, 116 dog types). By training neural
networks on this dataset, we found that: (i) Misclassifications are rarely
across superclasses, but mainly among subclasses within a superclass. (ii)
Ensemble networks trained each only on subclasses of a given superclass perform
better than the same network trained on all subclasses of all superclasses.
Hence, we propose a two-stage Super-Sub framework, and demonstrate that: (i)
The framework improves overall classification performance by 3.3%, by first
inferring a superclass using a generalist superclass-level network, and then
using a specialized network for final subclass-level classification. (ii)
Although the total parameter storage cost increases to a factor N+1 for N
superclasses compared to using a single network, with finetuning, delta and
quantization aware training techniques this can be reduced to 0.2N+1. Another
advantage of this efficient implementation is that the memory cost on the GPU
during inference is equivalent to using only one network. The reason is we
initiate each subclass-level network through addition of small parameter
variations (deltas) to the superclass-level network. (iii) Finally, our
framework promises to be more scalable and generalizable than the common
alternative of simply scaling up a vanilla network in size, since very large

$\tau$ from the query document. Due to its recursive definition, JSON data are
naturally represented as trees. Different from other hierarchical formats such
as XML, JSON supports both ordered and unordered sibling collections within a

distance computation. We propose JSON tree, a lossless tree representation of
JSON documents, and define the JSON Edit Distance (JEDI), the first edit-based
distance measure for JSON documents. We develop an algorithm, called QuickJEDI,
for computing JEDI by leveraging a new technique to prune expensive sibling
matchings. It outperforms a baseline algorithm by an order of magnitude in
runtime. To boost the performance of JSON similarity queries, we introduce an
index called JSIM and a highly effective upper bound based on tree sorting. Our
algorithm for the upper bound runs in $O(n \tau)$ time and $O(n + \tau \log n)$

new ""fully quasiclassical"" representation of the Volkov states has been found,
which is equivalent to the one known in the literature but which more
transparently shows the quasiclassical nature of the quantum dynamics of an
electron in a plane-wave field. Here, we derive the corresponding expression of
the propagator by constructing it using the fully quasiclassical form of the
Volkov states. The found expression allows one, together with the fully
quasiclassical expression of the Volkov states, to compute probabilities in
strong-field QED in an intense plane wave by manipulating only 2-by-2 rather
than 4-by-4 Dirac matrices as in the usual approach. Moreover, apart from the
exponential functions featuring the classical action of an electron in a plane
wave, the fully quasiclassical Volkov propagator depends only on the electron
kinetic four-momentum in the plane wave, which is a gauge-invariant quantity.
Finally, we also compute the one-loop tadpole diagram in a plane wave starting
from the Volkov propagator and we find that after renormalization it
identically vanishes.

learning a neural simulator of the environment from safe human trajectories,

sufficient pixel-based neural simulator quality can be achieved, and whether
the human data requirements are viable in terms of both quantity and quality.

dominant role in pairing the electrons and generating superconductivity. In
high temperature cuprate superconductors, the existence of the electron
coupling with phonons and other boson modes and its role in producing high
temperature superconductivity remain unclear. The evidence of the
electron-boson coupling mainly comes from the angle-resolved photoemission
(ARPES) observations of the ~70meV nodal dispersion kink and the ~40meV
antinodal kink. However, the reported results are sporadic and the nature of
the involved bosons are still under debate. Here we report new findings of
ubiquitous two coexisting electron-mode couplings in cuprate superconductors.
By taking ultra-high resolution laser-based ARPES measurements, combined with
the improved second derivative analysis method, we discovered that the
electrons are coupled simultaneously with two sharp phonon modes with energies
of ~70meV and ~40meV in different superconductors with different doping levels,
over the entire momentum space and at different temperatures above and below
the superconducting transition temperature. The observed electron-phonon
couplings are unusual because the associated energy scales do not exhibit an
obvious change across the superconducting transition. We further find that the
well-known ""peak-dip-hump"" structure, which has long been considered as a
hallmark of superconductivity, is also omnipresent and consists of finer
structures that originates from electron coupling with two sharp phonon modes.
These comprehensive results provide a unified picture to reconcile all the
reported observations and pinpoint the origin of the electron-mode couplings in
cuprate superconductors. They provide key information to understand the role of
the electron-phonon coupling in generating high temperature superconductivity.

regime in the high-frequency interval. While the former is observed in
structures both with and without translation symmetry property, the latter is
exclusive for aperiodic structures only. We show that the localization regime

KL-regularized reinforcement learning individually hold promise here, arguably
a hybrid approach could combine their respective benefits. Key to these fields
is the use of information asymmetry across architectural modules to bias which
skills are learnt. While asymmetry choice has a large influence on
transferability, existing methods base their choice primarily on intuition in a
domain-independent, potentially sub-optimal, manner. In this paper, we
theoretically and empirically show the crucial expressivity-transferability
trade-off of skills across sequential tasks, controlled by information
asymmetry. Given this insight, we introduce Attentive Priors for Expressive and
Transferable Skills (APES), a hierarchical KL-regularized method, heavily
benefiting from both priors and hierarchy. Unlike existing approaches, APES
automates the choice of asymmetry by learning it in a data-driven,
domain-dependent, way based on our expressivity-transferability theorems.
Experiments over complex transfer domains of varying levels of extrapolation
and sparsity, such as robot block stacking, demonstrate the criticality of the
correct asymmetric choice, with APES drastically outperforming previous
methods.

pivotal debate to widespread concerns is safety in the transportation system.
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been applied to autonomous driving to
provide solutions for obstacle avoidance. However, in a road traffic junction
scenario, the vehicle typically receives partial observations from the
transportation environment, while DRL needs to rely on long-term rewards to
train a reliable model by maximising the cumulative rewards, which may take the
risk when exploring new actions and returning either a positive reward or a
penalty in the case of collisions. Although safety concerns are usually
considered in the design of a reward function, they are not fully considered as
the critical metric to directly evaluate the effectiveness of DRL algorithms in
autonomous driving. In this study, we evaluated the safety performance of three
baseline DRL models (DQN, A2C, and PPO) and proposed a self-awareness module
from an attention mechanism for DRL to improve the safety evaluation for an
anomalous vehicle in a complex road traffic junction environment, such as
intersection and roundabout scenarios, based on four metrics: collision rate,
success rate, freezing rate, and total reward. Our two experimental results in
the training and testing phases revealed the baseline DRL with poor safety
performance, while our proposed self-awareness attention-DQN can significantly
improve the safety performance in intersection and roundabout scenarios.

environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into
under-explored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and
energy-efficient locomotion: perceiving the terrain before making contact with
it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed
and stability. However, utilizing exteroceptive perception robustly for
locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and
water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step~-- or are
missing altogether due to high reflectance. Additionally, depth perception can
degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent
surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and
general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception.
This severely limits locomotion speed, because the robot has to physically feel
out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here we present a robust
and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception
for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that
integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained
end-to-end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities
without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller
with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of
challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed
an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers.

bounds to avoid duplicate search in the backtracking process. In contrast to
usual pseudo-polynomial-time dynamic programming approaches, the computation
time of our method does not directly depend on the total cost values, but is
bounded by the input and output size of the decision diagrams. Therefore, it
can be much faster if the cost values are large but the input/output decision
diagrams are well-compressed. We demonstrate its practical efficiency by
comparing our method to current available enumeration methods: for nontrivial
size instances of the Hamiltonian path problem, our method succeeded in exactly
enumerating billions of all lower cost solutions in a few seconds, which was
hundred or much more times faster. Our method can be regarded as a novel search

attention on cross-modal text-image retrieval, where queries from one modality

applicability of the existing cross-modal retrieval systems for large-scale
applications in RS. To address this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel
deep unsupervised cross-modal contrastive hashing (DUCH) method for RS
text-image retrieval. The proposed DUCH is made up of two main modules: 1)
feature extraction module (which extracts deep representations of the
text-image modalities); and 2) hashing module (which learns to generate
cross-modal binary hash codes from the extracted representations). Within the
hashing module, we introduce a novel multi-objective loss function including:
i) contrastive objectives that enable similarity preservation in both intra-

binarization objectives for generating representative hash codes. Experimental

Different from the previous RDHEI algorithms, LPC is inspired by the planar map
coloring question, and it performs a dynamic image division process to divide
the original image into irregular regions instead of regular blocks as in the
previous RDHEI algorithms. In the process of LPC, pixel conversion is performed
by region; that is, pixels in the same regions are converted to the same
conversion values, which will occupy a smaller size, and then the available
room can be reserved to accommodate additional data. LPC is a reversible
process, so the original image can be losslessly recovered on the receiver
side. Experimental results show that the embedding capacity of the proposed
scheme outperforms the existing RDHEI algorithms.

between multiple Dirac cones in the Brillouin zone. To avoid this, a staggered
space-time lattice discretization has been developed in the literature, with

content from another single reference image. The primary challenge is how to
precisely place the pixels from the reference image into the hole region.
Therefore, understanding the 3D geometry that relates pixels between two views
is a crucial step towards building a better model. Given the complexity of
handling various types of reference images, we focus on the scenario where the
images are captured by freely moving the same camera around. Compared to the
previous work, we propose a principled approach that does not make heuristic
assumptions about the planarity of the scene. We leverage a monocular depth
estimate and predict relative pose between cameras, then align the reference
image to the target by a differentiable 3D reprojection and a joint
optimization of relative pose and depth map scale and offset. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both RealEstate10K and
MannequinChallenge dataset with large baselines, complex geometry and extreme
camera motions. We experimentally verify our approach is also better at
handling large holes.

massive mutiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems which aims at
maximizing the total energy efficiency (EE) under a sum power constraint at
each access point (AP) and a quality-of-service (QoS) constraint at each user.
Existing solutions for this optimization problem are based on solving a
sequence of second-order cone programs (SOCPs), whose computational complexity
scales dramatically with the network size. Therefore, they are not
implementable for practical large-scale cell-free massive MIMO systems. To
tackle this issue, we propose an iterative power control algorithm based on the
frame work of an accelerated projected gradient (APG) method. In particular,
each iteration of the proposed method is done by simple closed-form
expressions, where a penalty method is applied to bring constraints into the
objective in the form of penalty functions. Finally, the convergence of the
proposed algorithm is analytically proved and numerically compared to the known
solution based on SOCP. Simulations results demonstrate that our proposed power
control algorithm can achieve the same EE as the existing SOCPs-based method,
but more importantly, its run time is much lower (one to two orders of
magnitude reduction in run time, compared to the SOCPs-based approaches).

and depends on the rapid and reliable computation of the energy landscape.
First principles density functional based calculations are highly reliable,
faithfully describing the entire energy landscape. They are, however,
computationally intensive and slow compared to interatomic potentials. Great
progress has been made in the development of machine learning, or data derived,
potentials, which promise to describe the entire energy landscape at first
principles quality. However, compared to first principles approaches, their
preparation can be time consuming and delay searching. Ab initio random
structure searching (AIRSS) is a straightforward and powerful approach to
structure prediction, based on the stochastic generation of sensible initial
structures, and their repeated local optimisation. Here, a scheme, compatible
with AIRSS, for the rapid construction of disposable, or ephemeral, data
derived potentials (EDDPs) is described. These potentials are constructed using
a homogeneous, separable manybody environment vector, and iterative neural
network fits, sparsely combined through non-negative least squares. The
approach is first tested on methane, boron nitride, elemental boron and urea.
In the case of boron, an EDDP generated using data from small unit cells is
used to rediscover the complex $\gamma$-boron structure without recourse to
symmetry or fragments. Finally, an EDDP generated for silane (SiH$_4$) at 500
GPa enables the discovery of an extremely complex, dense, structure which
significantly modifies silane's high pressure phase diagram. This has
implications for the theoretical exploration for high temperature
superconductivity in the dense hydrides, which have so far largely depended on
searches in smaller unit cells.

objects, such as human bodies, faces, and hands; however, the construction of
such parametric models requires significant manual intervention and domain
expertise. Recently, neural implicit 3D representations have shown great
expressibility in capturing 3D shape geometry. We observe that deformable
object motion is often semantically structured, and thus propose to learn
Structured-implicit PArametric Models (SPAMs) as a deformable object
representation that structurally decomposes non-rigid object motion into
part-based disentangled representations of shape and pose, with each being
represented by deep implicit functions. This enables a structured
characterization of object movement, with part decomposition characterizing a
lower-dimensional space in which we can establish coarse motion correspondence.
In particular, we can leverage the part decompositions at test time to fit to
new depth sequences of unobserved shapes, by establishing part correspondences
between the input observation and our learned part spaces; this guides a robust
joint optimization between the shape and pose of all parts, even under dramatic
motion sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our part-aware shape and pose
understanding lead to state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and
tracking of depth sequences of complex deforming object motion. We plan to
release models to the public at https://pablopalafox.github.io/spams.

metal lines in the optical X-SHOOTER spectrum of an He-sdO and present the
first spectroscopic analysis of any magnetic hot subdwarf. For this we used
line-blanketed Tlusty non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models and assumed a
simple homogeneous magnetic field. The derived atmospheric parameters
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 44900 $\pm$ 1000 K and log g = 5.93 $\pm$ 0.15 are typical
for He-sdO stars, while the star is less hydrogen-poor than most He-sdOs at log
n(He)/n(H) = +0.28 $\pm$ 0.10. The star is a slow rotator ($v_\mathrm{rot}\sin
i$ < 40 km s$^{-1}$). Its chemical composition is N-rich and C- and O-poor, and
the Si and S abundances are close to solar. Combining the atmospheric
parameters with Gaia parallax and photometry, the stellar radius and luminosity
are found to be typical for He-sdOs and place the star on the helium main
sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Its mass of $0.93^{+0.44}_{-0.30}$

as well as the cascade electrons produced by the $\gamma\gamma$ and p$\gamma$

below the GeV gamma-ray band are attributed to the synchrotron radiations and
self-Compton process of the primary electrons, and the TeV excess is explained
with the $\gamma$-ray emission from the p$\gamma$ process via the $\pi^{0}$
decay. The cascade emission of the electrons produced via the $\gamma\gamma$
and p$\gamma$ interactions results in a keV-MeV excess in the SEDs, illustrated
as a bump or plateau. This extra photon field enhances the production of TeV
photons from the $p\gamma$ process, resulting in a reduction of the proton
power by about one order of magnitude. However, the derived powers are still
3--4 orders of magnitude larger than the Eddington limit, being challenged by
the current black hole accretion physics. Applying our model to Mrk 421, we

  Point-of-Interest Recommendation","To appear in ACM TOIS",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the popularity of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) increases,
designing accurate models for Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation receives
more attention. POI recommendation is often performed by incorporating
contextual information into previously designed recommendation algorithms. Some
of the major contextual information that has been considered in POI
recommendation are the location attributes (i.e., exact coordinates of a
location, category, and check-in time), the user attributes (i.e., comments,
reviews, tips, and check-in made to the locations), and other information, such
as the distance of the POI from user's main activity location, and the social
tie between users. The right selection of such factors can significantly impact
the performance of the POI recommendation. However, previous research does not
consider the impact of the combination of these different factors. In this
paper, we propose different contextual models and analyze the fusion of
different major contextual information in POI recommendation. The major
contributions of this paper are: (i) providing an extensive survey of
context-aware location recommendation (ii) quantifying and analyzing the impact
of different contextual information (e.g., social, temporal, spatial, and
categorical) in the POI recommendation on available baselines and two new
linear and non-linear models, that can incorporate all the major contextual
information into a single recommendation model, and (iii) evaluating the
considered models using two well-known real-world datasets. Our results
indicate that while modeling geographical and temporal influences can improve
recommendation quality, fusing all other contextual information into a
recommendation model is not always the best strategy.

that exhibit structural colors at the micrometer scale. Woodpile photonic
crystals (WPCs) fabricated via two-photon lithography (TPL) are promising as
building blocks to produce 3D geometries that generate structural colors due to
their ability to exhibit either omnidirectional or anisotropic photonic
stopbands. However, existing approaches have focused on achieving structural
colors when illuminating WPCs from the top, which necessitates print
resolutions beyond the limit of commercial TPL and/or post-processing
techniques. Here, we devised a new strategy to support high-order photonic
cavity modes upon side-illumination on WPCs that surprisingly generate large
reflectance peaks in the visible spectrum. Based on that, we demonstrate
one-step printing of 3D photonic structural colors without requiring
post-processing or subwavelength features. Vivid colors with reflectance peaks
exhibiting a full width at half maximum of ~25 nm, a maximum reflectance of
50%, gamut of ~85% of sRGB, and large viewing angles, were achieved. In
addition, we also demonstrated voxel-level manipulation and control of colors
in arbitrary-shaped 3D objects constituted with WPCs as unit cells, which has
great potential for applications in dynamic color displays, colorimetric
sensing, anti-counterfeiting, and light-matter interaction platforms.

However, there are few models that describe both the variations and

propose to model the ensemble of networks using a Dirichlet Process Mixture of
Exponential Random Graph Models (DPM-ERGMs), which divides the ensemble into
different clusters and models each cluster of networks using a separate
Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM). By employing a Dirichlet process
mixture, the number of clusters can be determined automatically and changed
adaptively with the data provided. Moreover, in order to perform full Bayesian
inference for DPM-ERGMs, we employ the intermediate importance sampling
technique inside the Metropolis-within-slice sampling scheme, which addressed
the problem of sampling from the intractable ERGMs on an infinite sample space.

factor and lifetime has emerged in recent years in photonics as a new tool of
manipulating light-matter interactions. However, most of the investigated
structures only support BIC resonances at very few discrete points in the w~k
space. Even when the BIC is switched to a quasi-BIC(QBIC) resonance through
perturbation, its frequency will still be located within a narrow spectral band
close to that of the original BIC, restricting their applications in many
fields where random or multiple input frequencies beyond the narrow band are
required. In this work, we demonstrate that a new set of QBIC resonances can be
supported by making use of a special binary grating consisting of two
alternatingly aligned ridge arrays with the same period and zero-approaching
ridge width difference on a slab waveguide. These QBIC resonances are
distributed continuously over a broad band along a line in the w~k space and
can thus be considered as one-dimensional QBICs. With the Q factors generally
affected by the ridge difference, it is now possible to choose arbitrarily any
frequencies on the dispersion line to achieve significantly enhanced
light-matter interactions, facilitating many applications where multiple input
wavelengths are required, e.g. sum or difference frequency generations in
nonlinear optics.

used as data-driven regularizers in the variational formulation of
superresolution. However, for each input image, this approach requires the
solution of a non-convex minimization problem which is computationally costly.
In this paper, we propose to learn two kind of neural networks in an
unsupervised way based on WPP loss functions. First, we show how convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) can be incorporated. Once the network, called WPPNet, is
learned, it can be very efficiently applied to any input image. Second, we
incorporate conditional normalizing flows to provide a tool for uncertainty
quantification. Numerical examples demonstrate the very good performance of
WPPNets for superresolution in various image classes even if the forward

novel view rendering of human performers that wear clothes with complex texture
patterns using a sparse set of camera views. Although some recent works have
achieved remarkable rendering quality on humans with relatively uniform
textures using sparse views, the rendering quality remains limited when dealing
with complex texture patterns as they are unable to recover the high-frequency
geometry details that observed in the input views. To this end, the proposed
HDhuman uses a human reconstruction network with a pixel-aligned spatial
transformer and a rendering network that uses geometry-guided pixel-wise
feature integration to achieve high-quality human reconstruction and rendering.
The designed pixel-aligned spatial transformer calculates the correlations
between the input views, producing human reconstruction results with
high-frequency details. Based on the surface reconstruction results, the
geometry-guided pixel-wise visibility reasoning provides guidance for
multi-view feature integration, enabling the rendering network to render
high-quality images at 2k resolution on novel views. Unlike previous neural
rendering works that always need to train or fine-tune an independent network
for a different scene, our method is a general framework that is able to
generalize to novel subjects. Experiments show that our approach outperforms
all the prior generic or specific methods on both synthetic data and real-world
data.

and the corresponding Standard Model predictions point convincingly towards the
existence of new physics for which a heavy neutral gauge boson ($Z^\prime$) is
a prime candidate. However, the effect of the mixing of the $Z^\prime$ with the
SM $Z$, even though it cannot be avoided by any symmetry, is usually assumed to
be small and thus neglected in phenomenological analyses. In this letter we
point out that a mixing of the naturally expected size leads to lepton flavour
universal contributions, providing a very good fit to $B$ data. Furthermore,
the global electroweak fit is affected by $Z-Z^\prime$ mixing where the tension
in the $W$ mass, recently confirmed and strengthened by the CDF measurement,
prefers a non-zero value of it. We find that a $Z^\prime$ boson with a mass
between $\approx 1-5\,\rm {TeV}$ can provide a unified explanations of the $B$
anomalies and the $W$ mass. This strongly suggests that the breaking of the new
gauge symmetry giving raise to the $Z^\prime$ boson is linked to electroweak
symmetry breaking with intriguing consequences for model building.

dwarf galaxies might host black holes in their centers, but with lower masses
(intermediate-mass black holes - IMBH). The impact of such IMBHs on the
evolution of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), however, has not been so
far properly analysed. In this work, we investigate the effects of an outflow
from an IMBH on the gas dynamics in dSph galaxies by means of non-cosmological,
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, letting the galactic gas
distribution evolve over 3 Gyr under the influence of the IMBH's outflow and
supernova feedback. All simulations have a numerical resolution of 20.0 pc
cell$^{-1}$. Two scenarios are considered to infer the differences in the
propagation of the outflow, one with a homogeneous ISM and another one with
inhomogeneities caused by supernovae feedback. A minimal initial speed and a
minimal initial density are required for the outflow to propagate, with the
values depending on the conditions of the medium. In an unperturbed medium, the
outflow propagates freely in both directions with the same velocity (lower than
the initial one), removing a small fraction of the gas from the galaxy (the
exact fraction depends on the initial physical conditions of the outflow).
However, in an inhomogeneous ISM, the impact of the outflow is substantially
reduced, and its contribution to the removal of gas from the galaxy is almost
negligible.

of the growth of chaos and entanglement in time. As a novel tool for the
characterization of quantum chaos, we introduce for this scope the
quasi-probability distribution behind the out-of-time-ordered correlator

has already been shown to outperform the simple use of OTOC as a probe to
distinguish between integrable and nonintegrable Hamiltonians. To provide a
thorough comparative analysis, we contrast the behavior of the nonclassicality
with entanglement measures, such as the tripartite mutual information of the

initial states would lie in the ""sea of chaos"" in the classical kicked-top

this indication by capturing it with this novel OTOC-based measure.

integrating component separation and instrumental parameter sampling within a
global framework, leading to complete end-to-end error propagation in the
$Planck$ Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) data analysis. Given the scope of the
BeyondPlanck analysis, a limited set of data is included in the component
separation process, leading to foreground parameter degeneracies. In order to
properly constrain the Galactic foreground parameters, we improve upon the
previous $\texttt{Commander}$ component separation implementation by adding a
suite of algorithmic techniques. These algorithms are designed to improve the
stability and computational efficiency for weakly constrained posterior
distributions. These are: 1) joint foreground spectral parameter and amplitude
sampling, building on ideas from Miramare; 2) component-based monopole
determination; 3) joint spectral parameter and monopole sampling; and 4)
application of informative spatial priors for component amplitude maps. We find
that the only spectral parameter with a significant signal-to-noise ratio using
the current BeyondPlanck data set is the peak frequency of the anomalous
microwave emission component, for which we find $\nu_{\mathrm{p}}=25.3\pm0.5$
GHz; all others must be constrained through external priors. Future works will
be aimed at integrating many more data sets into this analysis, both map and
time-ordered based, thereby gradually eliminating the currently observed
degeneracies in a controlled manner with respect to both instrumental
systematic effects and astrophysical degeneracies. When this happens, the
simple LFI-oriented data model employed in the current work will need to be
generalized to account for both a richer astrophysical model and additional

non-selfadjoint Baouendi-Grushin operator on the two-dimensional torus
$\mathbb{T}^2=\mathbb{R}^2/(2\pi\mathbb{Z})^2$ with H\""older dampings. The
operator is subelliptic degenerating along the vertical direction at $x=0$. We
exhibit three different situations:
  (i) the damping region verifies the geometric control condition with respect
to both the non-degenerate Hamiltonian flow and the vertical subelliptic flow;
  (ii) the undamped region contains a horizontal strip;
  (iii) the undamped part is a line. In all of these situations, we obtain
sharp resolvent estimates. Consequently, we prove the optimal energy decay rate
for the associated damped waved equations. For (i) and (iii), our results are
in sharp contrast to the Laplace resolvent since the optimal bound is governed
by the quasimodes in the subelliptic regime. While for (ii), the optimality is
governed by the quasimodes in the elliptic regime, and the optimal energy decay
rate is the same as for the classical damped wave equation on $\mathbb{T}^2$.
  Our analysis contains the study of adapted two-microlocal semiclassical
measures, construction of quasimodes and refined Birkhoff normal-form
reductions in different regions of the phase-space. Of independent interest, we
also obtain the propagation theorem for semiclassical measures of quasimodes
microlocalized in the subelliptic regime.

indicate that the interiors of hot Jupiters are heated by some anomalous energy
dissipation mechanism. Although a variety of physical processes have been
proposed to explain this heating, recent statistical evidence points to the
confirmation of explicit predictions of the Ohmic dissipation theory, elevating
this mechanism as the most promising candidate for resolving the radius
inflation problem. In this work, we present an analytic model for the
dissipation rate and derive a simple scaling law that links the magnitude of
energy dissipation to the thickness of the atmospheric weather layer. From this
relation, we find that the penetration depth influences the Ohmic dissipation
rate by an order of magnitude. We further investigate the weather layer depth
of hot Jupiters from the extent of their inflation and show that, depending on
the magnetic field strength, hot Jupiter radii can be maintained even if the
circulation layer is relatively shallow. Additionally, we explore the evolution
of zonal wind velocities with equilibrium temperature by matching our analytic
model to statistically expected dissipation rates. From this analysis, we
deduce that the wind speed scales approximately as
$1/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{eq}-T_0}$, where $T_0$ is a constant that equals $T_0 \sim
1000~\mathrm{K}-1800~\mathrm{K}$ depending on planet-specific parameters

  Point Cloud Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised learning has not been fully explored for point cloud
analysis. Current frameworks are mainly based on point cloud reconstruction.
Given only 3D coordinates, such approaches tend to learn local geometric
structures and contours, while failing in understanding high level semantic
content. Consequently, they achieve unsatisfactory performance in downstream
tasks such as classification, segmentation, etc. To fill this gap, we propose a
generic Contour-Perturbed Reconstruction Network (CP-Net), which can
effectively guide self-supervised reconstruction to learn semantic content in
the point cloud, and thus promote discriminative power of point cloud
representation. First, we introduce a concise contour-perturbed augmentation
module for point cloud reconstruction. With guidance of geometry disentangling,
we divide point cloud into contour and content components. Subsequently, we
perturb the contour components and preserve the content components on the point
cloud. As a result, self supervisor can effectively focus on semantic content,
by reconstructing the original point cloud from such perturbed one. Second, we
use this perturbed reconstruction as an assistant branch, to guide the learning
of basic reconstruction branch via a distinct dual-branch consistency loss. In
this case, our CP-Net not only captures structural contour but also learn
semantic content for discriminative downstream tasks. Finally, we perform
extensive experiments on a number of point cloud benchmarks. Part segmentation
results demonstrate that our CP-Net (81.5% of mIoU) outperforms the previous
self-supervised models, and narrows the gap with the fully-supervised methods.
For classification, we get a competitive result with the fully-supervised
methods on ModelNet40 (92.5% accuracy) and ScanObjectNN (87.9% accuracy). The
codes and models will be released afterwards.

reinforcement learning in single-agent scenarios with sparse reward signals,

discovery methods cannot be directly extended to multi-agent scenarios, since
the joint state space grows exponentially with the number of agents in the
system. Thus, existing researches on adopting options in multi-agent scenarios
still rely on single-agent option discovery and fail to directly discover the
joint options that can improve the connectivity of the joint state space of
agents. In this paper, we show that it is indeed possible to directly compute
multi-agent options with collaborative exploratory behaviors among the agents,
while still enjoying the ease of decomposition. Our key idea is to approximate
the joint state space as a Kronecker graph -- the Kronecker product of
individual agents' state transition graphs, based on which we can directly
estimate the Fiedler vector of the joint state space using the Laplacian
spectrum of individual agents' transition graphs. This decomposition enables us
to efficiently construct multi-agent joint options by encouraging agents to
connect the sub-goal joint states which are corresponding to the minimum or
maximum values of the estimated joint Fiedler vector. The evaluation based on
multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the proposed algorithm can
successfully identify multi-agent options, and significantly outperforms prior
works using single-agent options or no options, in terms of both faster

detail the implementation considerations, setbacks, and solutions that were
encountered during the integration. Next we examine the results of I/O write

resulting I/O times show over an order of magnitude speedup when using ADIOS2

of ADIOS2 are showcased, further boosting performance. Finally, usage of the
novel ADIOS2 in-situ analysis capabilities for weather forecasting is
demonstrated using a WRF forecasting pipeline, showing a seamless end-to-end

shown to improve software quality attributes, it is only a small piece of the

project smells which consider deficits in project management as a more holistic
perspective on software quality in ML projects. An open-source static analysis
tool mllint was also implemented to help detect and mitigate these. Our
research evaluates this novel concept of project smells in the industrial

Methods that rely on meta-cognitive information, such as confidence-based

various tasks. However, there is still a significant number of cases with no
optimal solution. Our aim is to exploit meta-cognitive information and to learn
from it, for the purpose of enhancing the ability of the group to produce a
correct answer. Specifically, we propose two different feature-representation
approaches: (1) Response-Centered feature Representation (RCR), which focuses
on the characteristics of the individual response instances, and (2)
Answer-Centered feature Representation (ACR), which focuses on the
characteristics of each of the potential answers. Using these two
feature-representation approaches, we train Machine-Learning (ML) models, for
the purpose of predicting the correctness of a response and of an answer. The
trained models are used as the basis of an ML-based aggregation methodology
that, contrary to other ML-based techniques, has the advantage of being a
""one-shot"" technique, independent from the crowd-specific composition and
personal record, and adaptive to various types of situations. To evaluate our
methodology, we collected 2490 responses for different tasks, which we used for
feature engineering and for the training of ML models. We tested our
feature-representation approaches through the performance of our proposed
ML-based aggregation methods. The results show an increase of 20% to 35% in the
success rate, compared to the use of standard rule-based aggregation methods.

fitted to those of the isotropic three-components Heisenberg model. However,
field theoretical calculations showed that the isotropic fixed point of the
renormalization group is unstable, and renormalization group iterations flow
either to a cubic fixed point or to a fluctuation-driven first-order
transition. Here we show that these two scenarios correspond to the cubic to
trigonal and to the cubic to tetragonal transitions, respectively. In both
cases, the critical behavior is described by slowly varying effective critical
exponents, which exhibit universal features. For the trigonal case, we predict
a crossover of the effective exponents from their Ising values to their cubic
values (which are close to the isotropic ones). For the tetragonal case, the
effective exponents can have the isotropic values over a wide temperature
range, before exhibiting large changes en route to the first-order transition.
New renormalization group calculations near the isotropic fixed point in three

been limited by the high cost of commercially available instruments. An
increasingly attractive solution to this cost issue is to use instruments
produced in-house from open source hardware, firmware, and post processing
building blocks. In the present work, we release the next iteration of the open
source drifter and waves monitoring instruments. The new design is both
significantly less expensive, much easier to build and assemble for people
without specific microelectronics and programming competence, more easily
extendable and customizable, and two orders of magnitude more power efficient.
Improving performance and reducing noise levels and costs compared with our
previous generation of instruments is possible in large part thanks to progress
from the electronics component industry. As a result, we believe that this will
allow scientists in geosciences to increase by an order of magnitude the amount

proved successful in cardiac index quantification, they seem vulnerable to mild
input perturbations, e.g., spatial transformations, image distortions, and
adversarial attacks. Such brittleness erodes our trust in CNN-based automated
diagnosis of various cardiovascular diseases. In this work, we describe a
simple and effective method to learn robust CNNs for left ventricle (LV)
quantification, including cavity and myocardium areas, directional dimensions,
and regional wall thicknesses. The key to the success of our approach is the
use of the biologically-inspired steerable pyramid transform (SPT) as fixed
front-end processing, which brings three computational advantages to LV
quantification. First, the basis functions of SPT match the anatomical
structure of the LV as well as the geometric characteristics of the estimated
indices. Second, SPT enables sharing a CNN across different orientations as a
form of parameter regularization, and explicitly captures the scale variations
of the LV in a natural way. Third, the residual highpass subband can be
conveniently discarded to further encourage robust feature learning. A concise
and effective metric, named Robustness Ratio, is proposed to evaluate the
robustness under various input perturbations. Extensive experiments on 145
cardiac sequences show that our SPT-augmented method performs favorably against
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy, but is
significantly more robust under input perturbations.

methods using quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present
a unified formulation (FEqa) to solve such problems using quantum annealers.
FEqa is a hybrid technique in which the finite element problem is formulated on
a classical computer, and the residual is minimized using a quantum annealer.
The advantages of FEqa include utilizing a single qubit per degree of freedom,
enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions a priori, reaching arbitrary solution
precision, and eliminating the possibility of the annealer generating invalid
results. FEqa is scalable on the classical portion of the algorithm due to its
Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) nature and does not rely on ground state
solutions from the annealer. The exponentially large number of collocation
points used in quantum annealing are investigated for their cosine measures,
and new iterative techniques are developed to exploit their properties. The
quantum annealer has clear advantages in computational time over simulated
annealing, for the example problems presented in this paper solved on the

  patents and inventors",,,,,"physics.soc-ph stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We analyse the bipartite dynamic network of inventors and patents registered
within the main area of electrical engineering in Germany to explore the
driving forces behind innovation. The data at hand leads to a bipartite
network, where an edge between an inventor and a patent is present if the
inventor is a co-owner of the respective patent. Since more than a hundred
thousand patents were filed by similarly as many inventors during the
observational period, this amounts to a massive bipartite network, too large to
be analysed as a whole. Therefore, we decompose the bipartite network by
utilising an essential characteristic of the network: most inventors tend to
stay active only for a relatively short period, while new ones become active at
each point in time. Consequently, the adjacency matrix carries several
structural zeros. To accommodate for these, we propose a bipartite variant of
the Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (TERGM) in which we let the actor
set vary over time, differentiate between inventors that already submitted
patents and those that did not, and account for pairwise statistics of
inventors. Our results corroborate the hypotheses that inventor characteristics
and knowledge flows play a crucial role in the dynamics of invention.

Patents are a key measure of innovation output, as patent indicators reflect
the inventive performance of countries, technologies and firms. This paper
provides new insights on the causal effects of the enlargement of the European
Union (EU) by investigating the patents performance within the new EU member
states (EU-13). The empirical results based on data collected from the OECD
database from 1985-2017 and causal impact using a Bayesian structural
time-series model (proposed by Google) point towards a conclusion that joining
the EU has had a significant impact on patents performance in Romania, Estonia,
Poland, Czech Republic, Croatia and Lithuania, although in the latter two
countries the impact was negative. For the rest of the EU-13 countries there is
no significant effect on patent performance. Whether the EU accession effect is
significant or not, the EU-13 are far behind the EU-15 (countries which entered
the EU before 2004) in terms of patent performance. The majority of patents
(98.66\%) are assigned to the EU-15, with just 1.34\% of assignees belonging to
the EU-13.

  https://github.com/mathren/top_down_compact_obj_mass",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Population synthesis relies on semi-analytic formulae to determine masses of
compact objects from the (helium or carbon-oxygen) cores of collapsing stars.
Such formulae are combined across mass ranges that span different explosion
mechanisms, potentially introducing artificial features in the compact object
mass distribution. Such artifacts impair the interpretation of
gravitational-wave observations. We propose a ""top-down"" remnant mass
prescription where we remove mass from the star for each possible mass-loss
mechanism, instead of relying on the fallback onto a ""proto-compact-object"" to
get the final mass. For one of these mass-loss mechanisms, we fit the
metallicity-dependent mass lost to pulsational-pair instability supernovae from
numerical simulations. By imposing no mass loss in the absence of pulses, our
approach recovers the existing compact object masses prescription at the low
mass end and ensures continuity across the
core-collapse/pulsational-pair-instability regime. Our remnant mass
prescription can be extended to include other mass-loss mechanisms at the final
collapse.

  Streams",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we focus on the problem of modeling dynamic geo-human
interactions in streams for online POI recommendations. Specifically, we
formulate the in-stream geo-human interaction modeling problem into a novel
deep interactive reinforcement learning framework, where an agent is a
recommender and an action is a next POI to visit. We uniquely model the
reinforcement learning environment as a joint and connected composition of
users and geospatial contexts (POIs, POI categories, functional zones). An
event that a user visits a POI in stream updates the states of both users and
geospatial contexts; the agent perceives the updated environment state to make
online recommendations. Specifically, we model a mixed-user event stream by
unifying all users, visits, and geospatial contexts as a dynamic knowledge
graph stream, in order to model human-human, geo-human, geo-geo interactions.
We design an exit mechanism to address the expired information challenge,
devise a meta-path method to address the recommendation candidate generation
challenge, and develop a new deep policy network structure to address the
varying action space challenge, and, finally, propose an effective adversarial
training method for optimization. Finally, we present extensive experiments to
demonstrate the enhanced performance of our method.

radiative transfer theory. The present tutorial wants to show how Monte Carlo
(MC) codes describing photons transport in anomalous media can be implemented.
It is shown that the heart of the method consists in suitably describing, in a
""non-classical"" manner, photons steps starting from fixed light sources or from
boundaries separating regions of the medium with different optical properties.
To give a better intuition of the importance of these particular photon step
lengths, it is also shown numerically that the described approach is essential
to preserve the invariance property for light propagation. An interesting
byproduct of the MC method for ART, is that it allow us to simplify the
structure of ""classical"" MC codes, utilized e.g. in biomedical optics.

Such correlation would be helpful in many fronts such as sensor fusion for
improved accuracy using cheaper sensors and attack detection and mitigation

inspired by traditional or digital game genres. Unlike SI-based algorithms,
in-dividuals do not work together with the goal of defeating other individuals
and winning the game. Battle royale optimizer (BRO) is a Gamed-based
me-taheuristic optimization algorithm that has been recently proposed for the
task of continuous problems. This paper proposes a modified BRO (M-BRO) in
order to improve balance between exploration and exploitation. For this matter,
an additional movement operator has been used in the movement strategy.
Moreover, no extra parameters are required for the proposed ap-proach.
Furthermore, the complexity of this modified algorithm is the same as the
original one. Experiments are performed on a set of 19 (unimodal and
multimodal) benchmark functions (CEC 2010). The proposed method has been
compared with the original BRO alongside six well-known/recently proposed
optimization algorithms. The results show that BRO with additional movement
operator performs well to solve complex numerical optimization problems
compared to the original BRO and other competitors.
