FSL, we aim to train meta-learner models that can leverage prior semantic
knowledge about novel classes to guide the classifier synthesis process. In
particular, we propose semantically-conditioned feature attention and sample
attention mechanisms that estimate the importance of representation dimensions

towards the utilization of meta-learners in more realistic and imperfect
settings. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed semantic FSL model with and without sample noise.

victims is one of the most significant digital forensic challenges.
Investigators often need to determine the age of victims by looking at images
and interpreting the sexual development stages and other human characteristics.
The main priority - safeguarding children -- is often negatively impacted by a
huge forensic backlog, cognitive bias and the immense psychological stress that
this work can entail. This paper evaluates existing facial image datasets and
proposes a new dataset tailored to the needs of similar digital forensic
research contributions. This small, diverse dataset of 0 to 20-year-old
individuals contains 245 images and is merged with 82 unique images from the
FG-NET dataset, thus achieving a total of 327 images with high image diversity
and low age range density. The new dataset is tested on the Deep EXpectation
(DEX) algorithm pre-trained on the IMDB-WIKI dataset. The overall results for
young adolescents aged 10 to 15 and older adolescents/adults aged 16 to 20 are
very encouraging -- achieving MAEs as low as 1.79, but also suggest that the
accuracy for children aged 0 to 10 needs further work. In order to determine
the efficacy of the prototype, valuable input of four digital forensic experts,
including two forensic investigators, has been taken into account to improve
age estimation results. Further research is required to extend datasets both
concerning image density and the equal distribution of factors such as gender
and racial diversity.

the description of electronic correlations from the ground state wavefunction
directly into the underlying Hamiltonian. In particular, Dobrautz et al. [Phys.
Rev. B, 99(7), 075119, (2019)] have demonstrated that the use of momentum-space
representation, combined with a non-unitary similarity transformation, results
in a Hubbard Hamiltonian that possesses a significantly more compact ground
state wavefunction, dominated by a single Slater determinant. This
compactness/single-reference character greatly facilitates electronic structure
calculations. As a consequence, however, the Hamiltonian becomes non-Hermitian,
posing problems for quantum algorithms based on the variational principle. We
overcome these limitations with the ansatz-based quantum imaginary time
evolution algorithm and apply the transcorrelated method in the context of
digital quantum computing. We demonstrate that this approach enables up to 4
orders of magnitude more accurate and compact solutions in various instances of
the Hubbard model at intermediate interaction strength ($U/t=4$), enabling the
use of shallower quantum circuits for wavefunction ansatzes. In addition, we
propose a more efficient implementation of the quantum imaginary time evolution
algorithm in quantum circuits that is tailored to non-Hermitian problems. To
validate our approach, we perform hardware experiments on the ibmq_lima quantum

M-Banking Apps, users are often distrustful of the security of the applications
due to an increasing trend of cyber security compromises, cyber-attacks, and
data breaches. Considering the upsurge in cyber security vulnerabilities of
M-Banking Apps and the paucity of research in this domain, this study was
conducted to empirically measure user-perceived security of M-Banking Apps. A
total of 315 responses from study participants were analysed using
covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). The results indicated
that most constructs of the baseline Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and
Use of Technology (UTAUT2) structure were validated. Perceived security,
institutional trust and technology trust were confirmed as factors that affect
user's intention to adopt and use M-Banking Apps. However, perceived risk was
not confirmed as a significant predictor. The current study further revealed
that in the context of M-Banking Apps, the effects of security and trust are
complex. The impact of perceived security and institutional trust on
behavioural intention was moderated by age, gender, experience, income, and
education, while perceived security on use behaviour was moderated by age,
gender, and experience. The effect of technology trust on behavioural intention
was moderated by age, education, and experience. Overall, the proposed
conceptual model achieved acceptable fit and explained 79% of the variance in
behavioural intention and 54.7% in use behaviour of M-Banking Apps, higher than
that obtained in the original UTAUT2. The guarantee of enhanced security,
advanced privacy mechanisms and trust should be considered paramount in future

quick and accurate diagnosis results. An automated segmentation method of
infection regions in the lung provides a quantitative criterion for diagnosis.
Previous methods employ whole 2D image or 3D volume-based processes. Infection
regions have a considerable variation in their sizes. Such processes easily
miss small infection regions. Patch-based process is effective for segmenting
small targets. However, selecting the appropriate patch size is difficult in
infection region segmentation. We utilize the scale uncertainty among various
receptive field sizes of a segmentation FCN to obtain infection regions. The
receptive field sizes can be defined as the patch size and the resolution of
volumes where patches are clipped from. This paper proposes an infection
segmentation network (ISNet) that performs patch-based segmentation and a scale
uncertainty-aware prediction aggregation method that refines the segmentation
result. We design ISNet to segment infection regions that have various
intensity values. ISNet has multiple encoding paths to process patch volumes
normalized by multiple intensity ranges. We collect prediction results
generated by ISNets having various receptive field sizes. Scale uncertainty
among the prediction results is extracted by the prediction aggregation method.
We use an aggregation FCN to generate a refined segmentation result considering
scale uncertainty among the predictions. In our experiments using 199 chest CT
volumes of COVID-19 cases, the prediction aggregation method improved the dice
similarity score from 47.6% to 62.1%.

environments. Swimming cells thrive in quiescent wetlands and sediments at the
bottom of the marine water column, where they mediate many essential
biogeochemical processes. While swimming motility in bulk fluid is now well
established, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating
self-transport in the confined interstices of porous media is lacking, and
determining the interactions between cells and surfaces of the solid matrix
becomes paramount. Here, we precisely track the movement of bacteria
(\emph{Magnetococcus marinus}) through a series of microfluidic porous media
with broadly varying geometries and show that cell motility results in a
succession of scattering events from the porous microstructure. Order or
disorder can impact the cells' motility over short ranges, but we directly
demonstrate that their large-scale transport properties are regulated by the
cutoff of their persistent swimming, which is dictated primarily by the
porosity and scale of the porous geometry. The effective mean free path is
established as the key geometrical parameter controlling transport, and along
with with minimal knowledge of cell swimming motility and surface scattering
properties, we implement a theoretical model that universally predicts the
effective diffusion of cells for the geometries studied here. These results are
an important step toward predicting the physical ecology of swimming cells in
quiescent porous media and understanding their role in environmental and health
hazards in stagnant water.

understanding of current and guide future research. Method: To provide this
overview, we conducted a systematic literature review. The survey comprises 116
publications that address counterexample explanations for model checking.
Results: Most primary studies provide counterexample explanations graphically
or as traces, minimize counterexamples to reduce complexity, localize errors in
the models expressed in the input formats of model checkers, support linear
temporal logic or computation tree logic specifications, and use model checkers
of the Symbolic Model Verifier family. Several studies evaluate their

We notably see a lack of research on counterexample explanation that targets
probabilistic and real-time systems, leverages the explanations to
domain-specific models, and evaluates approaches in user studies. We conclude
by discussing the adequacy of different types of explanations for users with
varying domain and formal methods expertise, showing the need to support
laypersons in understanding model checking results to increase adoption of

First, we bound the generalization error in terms of expected (not uniform)
stability which arguably leads to quantitatively sharper bounds. Second, as our
main contribution, we introduce Exponential Family Langevin Dynamics (EFLD), a
substantial generalization of SGLD, which includes noisy versions of Sign-SGD
and quantized SGD as special cases. We establish data-dependent expected
stability based generalization bounds for any EFLD algorithm with a O(1/n)
sample dependence and dependence on gradient discrepancy rather than the norm
of gradients, yielding significantly sharper bounds. Third, we establish
optimization guarantees for special cases of EFLD. Further, empirical results
on benchmarks illustrate that our bounds are non-vacuous, quantitatively
sharper than existing bounds, and behave correctly under noisy labels.

solutions for those problems. In an SBOS problem, a finite number of systems
are contenders. Inside each system, a continuous decision variable affects the
system's expected performance. An SBOS problem compares different systems based
on their expected performances under their own optimally chosen decision to
select the best, without advance knowledge of expected performances of the
systems nor the optimizing decision inside each system. We design
easy-to-implement algorithms that adaptively chooses a system and a choice of
decision to evaluate the noisy system performance, sequentially eliminates
inferior systems, and eventually recommends a system as the best after spending
a user-specified budget. The proposed algorithms integrate the stochastic
gradient descent method and the sequential elimination method to simultaneously
exploit the structure inside each system and make comparisons across systems.
For the proposed algorithms, we prove exponential rates of convergence to zero
for the probability of false selection, as the budget grows to infinity. We
conduct three numerical examples that represent three practical cases of SBOS
problems. Our proposed algorithms demonstrate consistent and stronger
performances in terms of the probability of false selection over benchmark
algorithms under a range of problem settings and sampling budgets.

of composite materials. To achieve this, a new computational framework is
presented that integrates phase field fracture and cohesive zone models to
simulate fibre breakage, matrix cracking and fibre-matrix debonding. The
composite microstructure is represented by an embedded cell at the vicinity of
the crack tip, whilst the rest of the sample is modelled as an anisotropic
elastic solid. The model is first validated against experimental data of
transverse matrix cracking from single-notched three-point bending tests. Then,
the model is extended to predict the influence of grain bridging,
brick-and-mortar microstructure and 3D fibre bridging on crack growth
resistance. The results show that these microstructures are very efficient in
enhancing the fracture toughness via fibre-matrix debonding, fibre breakage and
crack deflection. In particular, the 3D fibre bridging effect can increase the
energy dissipated at failure by more than three orders of magnitude, relative
to that of the bulk matrix; well in excess of the predictions obtained from the
rule of mixtures. These results shed light on microscopic bridging mechanisms
and provide a virtual tool for developing high fracture toughness composites.

distinguishability of the states of a logical value 0 and a logical value 1. In
the considered ion qubits, the identification of the quantum state is achieved
by measuring the fluorescence of the ion by repeated excitation of the cyclic
transition, which includes only the lower energy state that sets a logical
value 0 and becomes bright, but does not include the upper metastable state
that remains dark and sets logical value 1. It is important to note that it is
not always possible to achieve low levels of registration errors due to the
finite lifetime of excited levels, photon scattering, dark noise, low numerical
aperture values, etc. However, even under such conditions, with use of the
model of fuzzy quantum measurements, it is possible to provide precise control
of quantum states. We show that a model that is characterized by relatively
high levels of errors under conditions, where we have a reliable statistical
model of their occurrence, is more accurate than the case when the considered
errors are small, but we do not have an adequate statistical model for the
occurrence of these errors. In the given illustrative examples, we show that
the factor of reducing the loss of accuracy with the use of the model of fuzzy

model assumptions, and goodness of fit into consideration. To diagnose issues
with any of these factors, it can be helpful to understand regression model
estimates at a more granular level. We propose a new method for decomposing
point estimates from a regression model via weights placed on data clusters.
The weights are informed only by the model specification and data availability
and thus can be used to explicitly link the effects of data imbalance and model
assumptions to actual model estimates. The weight matrix has been understood in
linear models as the hat matrix in the existing literature. We extend it to
Bayesian hierarchical regression models that incorporate prior information and
complicated dependence structures through the covariance among random effects.
We show that the model weights, which we call borrowing factors, generalize
shrinkage and information borrowing to all regression models. In contrast, the
focus of the hat matrix has been mainly on the diagonal elements indicating the
amount of leverage. We also provide metrics that summarize the borrowing
factors and are practically useful. We present the theoretical properties of
the borrowing factors and associated metrics and demonstrate their usage in two
examples. By explicitly quantifying borrowing and shrinkage, researchers can
better incorporate domain knowledge and evaluate model performance and the
impacts of data properties such as data imbalance or influential points.

forced by means of a non-connected tile that is mainly hexagonal) and
motif-based hexagonal tilings that followed this major discovery. Here instead,

make it work. Additional motifs can be added to the monotile to provide some
insights. The proof of aperiodicity is presented with the use of such motifs.

phenomena, from long duration spectral state changes to short-term broadband
variability and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). A particularly puzzling
aspect is the production of QPOs, which -- if properly understood -- could be
used as a powerful diagnostic tool of black hole accretion and evolution. In
this work we analyse a high resolution three-dimensional general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin accretion disk which is
tilted by $65^{\circ}$ with respect to the black hole spin axis. We find that
the Lense-Thirring torque from the rapidly spinning 10 $M_\odot$ black hole
causes several sub-disks to tear off within $\sim 10-20$ gravitational radii.
Tearing occurs in cycles on timescales of seconds. During each tearing cycle
the inner sub-disk precesses for 1-5 periods before it falls into the black
hole. We find a precession frequency of $\sim 3\rm Hz$, consistent with
observed low-frequency QPOs. In addition, we find a high frequency QPO (HFQPO)
with centroid frequency of $\sim55$Hz in the power spectra of the mass-weighted
radius of the inner disk. This signal is caused by radial epicyclic
oscillations of a dense ring of gas at the tearing radius, which strongly
suggests a corresponding modulation of the X-ray lightcurve and may thus
explain some of the observed HFQPOs.

counterfactual simulations, we quantify the effect of gender bias on loan
granting outcomes and the welfare of the company and the borrowers. Our results
imply that both the existence of the preference-based bias and that of the
belief-based bias reduce the company's profits. When the preference-based bias
is removed, the company earns more profits. When the belief-based bias is
removed, the company's profits also increase. Both increases result from
raising the approval probability for borrowers, especially male borrowers, who
eventually pay back loans. For borrowers, the elimination of either bias
decreases the gender gap of the true positive rates in the credit risk
evaluation. We also train machine learning algorithms on both the real-world

made by those algorithms to see how evaluators' biases are inherited by the

holy-grail of machine translation (MT) research. While recent progress in
massively multilingual MT is one step closer to reaching this goal, it is
becoming evident that extending a multilingual MT system simply by training on
more parallel data is unscalable, since the availability of labeled data for
low-resource and non-English-centric language pairs is forbiddingly limited. To
this end, we present a pragmatic approach towards building a multilingual MT
model that covers hundreds of languages, using a mixture of supervised and
self-supervised objectives, depending on the data availability for different
language pairs. We demonstrate that the synergy between these two training
paradigms enables the model to produce high-quality translations in the
zero-resource setting, even surpassing supervised translation quality for low-
and mid-resource languages. We conduct a wide array of experiments to
understand the effect of the degree of multilingual supervision, domain
mismatches and amounts of parallel and monolingual data on the quality of our
self-supervised multilingual models. To demonstrate the scalability of the
approach, we train models with over 200 languages and demonstrate high
performance on zero-resource translation on several previously under-studied
languages. We hope our findings will serve as a stepping stone towards enabling
translation for the next thousand languages.

a model-free and finite-population-exact framework for randomized experiments

""warning accuracy,"" defined as the threshold such that the causal conclusion
drawn from the measured outcomes may differ from that based on the true

show how learning the warning accuracy and related concepts can benefit a
randomized experiment subject to outcome misclassification. We show that the
warning accuracy can be computed efficiently (even for large datasets) by
adaptively reformulating an integer program with respect to the randomization
design. Our framework covers both Fisher's sharp null and Neyman's weak null,
works for a wide range of randomization designs, and can also be applied to
observational studies adopting randomization-based inference. We apply our
framework to a large randomized clinical trial for the prevention of prostate
cancer.

to validate our fitting pipelines and check for systematic errors. We uncover a
significant trend between group richness and mean surface brightness within the

presence of unresolved systematics, and can result in biased peculiar
velocities. This is removed using multiple FP fits as function of group
richness, a procedure made tractable through a new analytic derivation for the

to the signs of both the real and imaginary parts of the DFT. We focus on
images for analysis and simulations, thus using the sign of the 2D-DFT. This
choice of the class of signals is inspired by previous works on this problem.
For our algorithm, we show that the expected mean squared error (MSE) in signal

that uses contraction mapping, based on the Banach fixed point theorem.

Hinduism and is known as the forefront of the Vedic corpus of Hinduism. In the
last two centuries, there has been a lot of interest in Hindu philosophy from

although the style and vocabulary in the respective translations vary widely,
the sentiment analysis and semantic similarity shows that the message conveyed

nonstationary dynamics, and partially observed state. This hybrid model can
leverage existing mechanistic models and facilitate learning from heterogeneous

samples quantifying model uncertainty. Then, we introduce hybrid model-based
Bayesian RL, accounting for both inherent stochasticity and model uncertainty,
to guide optimal, robust, and interpretable dynamic decision making. Cell
therapy manufacturing examples are used to empirically demonstrate that the
proposed framework can outperform the classical deterministic mechanistic model

and multi-constraint, the dynamic game algorithm is applied to modelling the
interaction and decision making between AV and human driver. Additionally, to
guarantee the lane-change safety of AVs, an artificial potential field model is
built for collision risk assessment. Finally, the proposed algorithm is
evaluated through human-in-the-loop experiments on a driving simulator, and the

solution for automatic image annotation due to their non-parametric nature,
good performance, and their accessibility through libraries such as TensorFlow.
Among other fields, DCNNs are also a common approach to the annotation of large
astronomical image databases acquired by digital sky surveys. One of the main
downsides of DCNNs is the complex non-intuitive rules that make DCNNs act as a
``black box"", providing annotations in a manner that is unclear to the user.
Therefore, the user is often not able to know what information is used by the
DCNNs for the classification. Here we demonstrate that the training of a DCNN
is sensitive to the context of the training data such as the location of the
objects in the sky. We show that for basic classification of elliptical and
spiral galaxies, the sky location of the galaxies used for training affects the
behavior of the algorithm, and leads to a small but consistent and
statistically significant bias. That bias exhibits itself in the form of
cosmological-scale anisotropy in the distribution of basic galaxy morphology.
Therefore, while DCNNs are powerful tools for annotating images of extended
sources, the construction of training sets for galaxy morphology should take
into consideration more aspects than the visual appearance of the object. In
any case, catalogs created with deep neural networks that exhibit signs of
cosmological anisotropy should be interpreted with the possibility of
consistent bias.

multiplication in organic photovoltaic materials, subtle changes in

fission. To understand why certain packing morphologies are more conducive to
charge multiplication by triplet pair (TT) formation, we measure the
diffraction-limited transient absorption (TA) response from four single-crystal
functionalized derivatives of fluorinated anthradithiophene: diF R-ADT (R =
TES, TSBS, TDMS, TBDMS). diF TES-ADT and diF TDMS-ADT both exhibit 2D brickwork
packing structures, diF TSBS-ADT adopts a 1D sandwich-herringbone packing
structure, and diF TBDMS-ADT exhibits a 1D twisted-columnar packing structure.
When brickwork or twisted-columnar single crystals are resonantly probed
parallel to their charge transfer (CT)-axis projections, the TA signal is
dominated by a rising component on the picosecond timescale (rate $k_{TT}$)
attributed to TT state population. When probed orthogonal to the CT-axis, we
instead recover the falling TA kinetics of singlet state depletion at rate,
$k_{A}$. The rising to falling rate ratio estimates the TT formation
efficiency, $\epsilon_{TT}$ = $k_{TT}/k_A$ relative to exciton self-trapping.
$\epsilon_{TT}$ ranged from near unity in diF TES-ADT to 84% in diF TDMS-ADT.
Interestingly, diF TSBS-ADT crystals only manifest falling kinetics of
CT-mediated self-trapping and singlet state depletion. Singlet fission is
prohibitive in diF TSBS-ADT crystals owing to its lower symmetry sandwich
herringbone packing that leads to $S_1$ to CT-state energy separation that is
~3x larger than in other packings. Collectively, these results highlight
optimal packing configurations that either enhance or completely suppress
CT-mediated TT-pair formation.

disc-dominated field galaxies in the simulations have older inner regions,

quenching of the cluster galaxies. Prior to group/cluster infall, galaxies of a
given present-day mass and morphology exhibit a similar evolution in their
specific star formation rate (sSFR) profiles. Post-infall, the outer sSFRs of
group and cluster galaxies significantly decrease due to interstellar medium
stripping, while the central sSFR remains similar to field galaxies. Field disc
galaxies instead generally retain radially increasing sSFR profiles. Thus,
field galaxies continue to develop negative age gradients (younger discs),

magnetic properties quantitatively. We perform the nonlinear force-free field
extrapolations with preprocessed photospheric vector magnetograms. In addition,
remote-sensing observations are employed to find indirect evidence of MFRs on
the Sun and to analyze the time evolution of magnetic reconnection flux
associated with the flare ribbons during the eruption. A coherent

quantitatively for one event from the combined analysis of the extrapolation

before and after reporting of bots promoting the hashtag was broadcast by the
mainstream media. Though we did not find many bots, the most bot-like accounts
were social bots, which present as genuine humans. Further, we distilled
meaningful quantitative differences between two polarised communities in the
Twitter discussion, resulting in the following insights. First, Supporters of
the arson narrative promoted misinformation by engaging others directly with
replies and mentions using hashtags and links to external sources. In response,
Opposers retweeted fact-based articles and official information. Second,
Supporters were embedded throughout their interaction networks, but Opposers
obtained high centrality more efficiently despite their peripheral positions.
By the last phase, Opposers and unaffiliated accounts appeared to coordinate,
potentially reaching a broader audience. Finally, unaffiliated accounts shared
the same URLs as Opposers over Supporters by a ratio of 9:1 in the last phase,
having shared mostly Supporter URLs in the first phase. This foiled Supporters'
efforts, highlighting the value of exposing misinformation campaigns. We
speculate that the communication strategies observed here could be discoverable
in other misinformation-related discussions and could inform
counter-strategies.

cold dark matter near Sgr A* generally produces small measurable phase shift in
the gravitational waveform. In the case that there is an axion cloud near Sgr
A*, the dynamical friction induced modification to gravitational waveform is
measurable only if the mass of the axion field is in a narrow range of the mass
spectrum. Gravitational interaction between the axion cloud and the
stellar-mass black holes may introduce additional precession around the spin of
Sgr A*. This additional precession rate is generally weaker than the
spin-induced Lense-Thirring precession rate, but nevertheless may contaminate
the spin measurement in a certain parameter regime. At last, we point out that
the multi-body gravitational interaction between these stellar-mass black holes
generally causes negligible phase shift during the LISA lifetime.

  Parking Environments","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) has been applied for autonomous parking
due to quickly solving high-dimensional motion planning and easily reflecting
constraints. However, planning time increases by the low probability of
extending toward narrow parking spots without collisions. To reduce the
planning time, the target tree algorithm was proposed, substituting a parking
goal in RRT with a set (target tree) of backward parking paths. However, it
consists of circular and straight paths, and an autonomous vehicle cannot park
accurately because of curvature-discontinuity. Moreover, the planning time
increases in complex environments; backward paths can be blocked by obstacles.
Therefore, this paper introduces the continuous-curvature target tree algorithm
for complex parking environments. First, a target tree includes clothoid paths
to address such curvature-discontinuity. Second, to reduce the planning time
further, a cost function is defined to construct a target tree that considers
obstacles. Integrated with optimal-variant RRT and searching for the shortest
path among the reached backward paths, the proposed algorithm obtains a
near-optimal path as the sampling time increases. Experiment results in real
environments show that the vehicle more accurately parks, and
continuous-curvature paths are obtained more quickly and with higher success
rates than those acquired with other sampling-based algorithms.

autoregulation. Although gene regulation is a central topic in biology,
autoregulation is much less studied. In general, it is extremely difficult to
determine the existence of autoregulation with direct biochemical approaches.
Nevertheless, some papers have observed that certain types of autoregulations
are linked to noise levels in gene expression. We generalize these results by
two propositions on discrete-state continuous-time Markov chains. These two
propositions form a simple but robust method to infer the existence of
autoregulation from gene expression data. This method only needs to compare the
mean and variance of the gene expression level. Compared to other methods for
inferring autoregulation, our method only requires non-interventional one-time
data, and does not need to estimate parameters. Besides, our method has few
restrictions on the model. We apply this method to four groups of experimental
data and find some genes that might have autoregulation. Some inferred
autoregulations have been verified by experiments or other theoretical works.

  Transmission",,,,,"cs.IT cs.AR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To fully support vertical industries, 5G and its corresponding channel coding
are expected to meet requirements of different applications. However, for
applications of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) such as URLLC, the transmission latency
is required to be much shorter than that in eMBB. Therefore, the resulting
channel code length reduces drastically. In this case, the traditional 1-D
channel coding suffers a lot from the performance degradation and fails to
deliver strong reliability with very low latency. To remove this bottleneck,
new channel coding scheme beyond the existing 1-D one is in urgent need. By
making full use of the spacial freedom of massive MIMO systems, this paper
devotes itself in proposing a spatiotemporal 2-D channel coding for very low
latency reliable transmission. For a very short time-domain code length
$N^{\text{time}}=16$, $64 \times 128$ MIMO system employing the proposed
spatiotemporal 2-D coding scheme successfully shows more than $3$\,dB
performance gain at $\text{FER}=10^{-3}$, compared to the 1-D time-domain
channel coding. It is noted that the proposed coding scheme is suitable for
different channel codes and enjoys high flexibility to adapt to difference
scenarios. By appropriately selecting the code rate, code length, and the
number of codewords in the time and space domains, the proposed coding scheme
can achieve a good trade-off between the transmission latency and reliability.

distinct signing schemes -- static and dynamic point-on-hand signing -- need to
be sufficiently addressed.
  With the advent of many off-the-shelf hand skeleton prediction models and
that training a model to recognize a sign language from scratch is expensive,
we explore an approach building upon recently launched MediaPipe Hands (MPH).
MPH is a high-precision well-trained model for hand-keypoint detection.

starting from object tracking to video surveillance and more recently,
autonomous driving. With the rapid development of deep learning in object
detection, pedestrian detection has achieved very good performance in
traditional single-dataset training and evaluation setting. However, in this
study on generalizable pedestrian detectors, we show that, current pedestrian
detectors poorly handle even small domain shifts in cross-dataset evaluation.
We attribute the limited generalization to two main factors, the method and the
current sources of data. Regarding the method, we illustrate that biasness
present in the design choices (e.g anchor settings) of current pedestrian
detectors are the main contributing factor to the limited generalization. Most
modern pedestrian detectors are tailored towards target dataset, where they do
achieve high performance in traditional single training and testing pipeline,
but suffer a degrade in performance when evaluated through cross-dataset
evaluation. Consequently, a general object detector performs better in
cross-dataset evaluation compared with state of the art pedestrian detectors,
due to its generic design. As for the data, we show that the autonomous driving
benchmarks are monotonous in nature, that is, they are not diverse in scenarios
and dense in pedestrians. Therefore, benchmarks curated by crawling the web
(which contain diverse and dense scenarios), are an efficient source of
pre-training for providing a more robust representation. Accordingly, we
propose a progressive fine-tuning strategy which improves generalization. Code

polarization of the pump pulse, which is shown to reshape the spatio-temporal
distribution of the optical perturbation. The photoinduced anisotropic
response, driven by out-of-equilibrium carriers and extinguished in a
sub-picosecond temporal window, is readily controlled in intensity by tuning
the polarization direction of the excitation up to a full sign reversal. This
work proves that nonlinear metasurfaces offer the flexibility to tailor their
ultrafast optical response in a fully all-optically reconfigurable platform.

quantum device, taking a modular design strategy may mitigate numerous
engineering challenges for achieving large-scalable quantum processors with
superconducting qubits. Nevertheless, a major challenge in the modular quantum
device is how to realize high-fidelity entanglement operations on qubits housed
in different modules while preserving the desired isolation between modules. In
this work, we propose a conceptual design of a modular quantum device, where
nearby modules are spatially separated by centimeters. In principle, each
module can contain tens of superconducting qubits, and can be separately
fabricated, characterized, packaged, and replaced. By introducing a bridge
module between nearby qubit modules and taking the coupling scheme utilizing a
tunable bus, tunable coupling of qubits that are housed in nearby qubit
modules, could be realized. Given physically reasonable assumptions, we expect
that sub-100-ns two-qubit gates for qubits housed in nearby modules which are
spatially separated by more than two centimeters could be obtained. In this
way, the inter-module gate operations are promising to be implemented with gate
performance comparable with that of intra-module gate operations. Moreover,
with help of through-silicon vias technologies, this long-range coupling scheme
may also allow one to implement inter-module couplers in a multi-chip stacked
processor. Thus, the tunable longer-range coupling scheme and the proposed
modular architecture may provide a promising foundation for solving challenges
toward large-scale quantum information processing with superconducting qubits.

with high-dimensional datasets. This happens primarily due to the use of
T-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus,
there are hardly any work dealing with datasets with dimensions more than
hundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle
datasets with dimensions even more than 7000! In this context, we propose an
adaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of
``numeric underflow"" and ``fake minimum"" that arise for existing fuzzy systems
while dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an Adaptive
Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to
perform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this
context, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the
consequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two
successive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design
an enhanced fuzzy rule base (En-FRB), which maintains adequate rules but does
not grow the number of rules exponentially with dimension that typically
happens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated Feature Selection and Rule
Extraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: (i)
feature selection, (ii) rule extraction, and (iii) fine tuning. The
effectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five
are in more than 2000 dimension including two with dimension greater than 7000.
This may be the first time fuzzy systems are realized for classification
involving more than 7000 input features.

structural information from documents, has attracted more and more attention in
many fields. Most existing works discuss this issue with the token-level
multi-label classification framework by distinguishing the tokens as different
roles while ignoring the writing styles of documents. The writing style is a
special way of content organizing for documents and it is relative fixed in
documents with a special field (e.g. financial, medical documents, etc.). We
argue that the writing style contains important clues for judging the roles for
tokens and the ignorance of such patterns might lead to the performance
degradation for the existing works. To this end, we model the writing style in
documents as a distribution of argument roles, i.e., Role-Rank Distribution,
and propose an event extraction model with the Role-Rank Distribution based
Supervision Mechanism to capture this pattern through the supervised training
process of an event extraction task. We compare our model with state-of-the-art

approach outperforms other alternatives with the captured patterns. This

multi-granularity labels to each object and focuses on encoding the label
hierarchy, e.g., [""Albatross"", ""Laysan Albatross""] from coarse-to-fine levels.
However, the definition of what is fine-grained is subjective, and the image
quality may affect the identification. Thus, samples could be observed at any
level of the hierarchy, e.g., [""Albatross""] or [""Albatross"", ""Laysan
Albatross""], and examples discerned at coarse categories are often neglected in
the conventional setting of HMC. In this paper, we study the HMC problem in
which objects are labeled at any level of the hierarchy. The essential designs
of the proposed method are derived from two motivations: (1) learning with
objects labeled at various levels should transfer hierarchical knowledge
between levels; (2) lower-level classes should inherit attributes related to
upper-level superclasses. The proposed combinatorial loss maximizes the
marginal probability of the observed ground truth label by aggregating
information from related labels defined in the tree hierarchy. If the observed
label is at the leaf level, the combinatorial loss further imposes the
multi-class cross-entropy loss to increase the weight of fine-grained
classification loss. Considering the hierarchical feature interaction, we
propose a hierarchical residual network (HRN), in which granularity-specific
features from parent levels acting as residual connections are added to
features of children levels. Experiments on three commonly used datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to the state-of-the-art

revised void galaxy densities, when including faint galaxies in voids defined
by bright galaxies, are still underdense compared to the mean density from the
entire field. In addition, we classify galaxies into star-forming, quiescent,
and green valley populations, and find that void galaxies tend to have slightly
higher fractions of star-forming galaxies under the mass and redshift control,
although the significance of this result is only moderate (2$\sigma$). However,
when we focus on the star-forming population, the distribution of the specific
star formation rate (sSFR) of void galaxies shows little difference from that
of the control galaxies. Similarly, the median sSFR of star-forming void
galaxies is also in good agreement with that of the star-forming control

  Imputation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data imputation has been extensively explored to solve the missing data
problem. The dramatically increasing volume of incomplete data makes the
imputation models computationally infeasible in many real-life applications. In
this paper, we propose an effective scalable imputation system named SCIS to
significantly speed up the training of the differentiable generative
adversarial imputation models under accuracy-guarantees for large-scale
incomplete data. SCIS consists of two modules, differentiable imputation
modeling (DIM) and sample size estimation (SSE). DIM leverages a new masking
Sinkhorn divergence function to make an arbitrary generative adversarial
imputation model differentiable, while for such a differentiable imputation
model, SSE can estimate an appropriate sample size to ensure the user-specified
imputation accuracy of the final model. Extensive experiments upon several
real-life large-scale datasets demonstrate that, our proposed system can
accelerate the generative adversarial model training by 7.1x. Using around 7.6%
samples, SCIS yields competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art imputation
methods in a much shorter computation time.

Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) to measure the branching fraction of the Higgs
boson decay to two photons, BR($H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$). Since photons are
massless, the Higgs boson coupling to photons is realized through higher order
processes involving heavy particles either from the Standard Model or beyond.
Any deviation of the measured BR($H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$), and consequently
of the Higgs coupling $g_{H\gamma\gamma}$ from the predictions of the Standard
Model, may indicate New Physics. The Higgs decay to two photons is thus an
interesting probe of the Higgs sector.
  This study is performed using simulation of the detector for CLIC and by
considering all relevant physics and beam-induced processes in a full
reconstruction chain. It is shown that the product of the Higgs production
cross-section in $W^+W^-$ fusion and BR($H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$) can be
measured with a relative statistical uncertainty of 5.5\%, assuming the

target is to maximize network energy efficiency (NEE) via jointly optimizing
the AF relay matrix and precoding vector at the secondary transmitter, as well
as the receiver combining vector at monitor, subject to the maximum power
constraint at the secondary transmitter and minimum data rate requirement of
the secondary user. We also guarantee that the achievable data rate of the

in part due to the inherent hardware design, but also due to the appealing
simplicity of noise statistics that result from the direct sensor readings.
Despite this, the availability of RAW images is limited in comparison with the
abundance and diversity of available RGB data. Recent approaches have attempted
to bridge this gap by estimating the RGB to RAW mapping: handcrafted
model-based methods that are interpretable and controllable usually require
manual parameter fine-tuning, while end-to-end learnable neural networks
require large amounts of training data, at times with complex training
procedures, and generally lack interpretability and parametric control. Towards
addressing these existing limitations, we present a novel hybrid model-based

learnable and interpretable. Our proposed invertible model, capable of
bidirectional mapping between RAW and RGB domains, employs end-to-end learning
of rich parameter representations, i.e. dictionaries, that are free from direct
parametric supervision and additionally enable simple and plausible data
augmentation. We evidence the value of our data generation process by extensive
experiments under both RAW image reconstruction and RAW image denoising tasks,
obtaining state-of-the-art performance in both. Additionally, we show that our

chaos via period-doubling cascades, reverse period-doubling route,
antimonotonicity, via closed invariant curve to chaos. The results were
confirmed using the techniques of bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent

and different dynamical regimes such as synchronous, asynchronous, chimera
states are revealed. Different continuous and piecewise continuous wavy
patterns were also found during the simulations for negative coupling

interest for several applications such as vehicular communications, indoor
localization and activity recognition, covert military communications, and
satellite-based remote sensing. In these frameworks, bistatic/passive radar
deployments with directional beams explore the angular search space and
identify mobile users/radar targets. Subsequently, directional communication
links are established with these mobile users. Consequently, JRC parameters
such as the time trade-off between the radar exploration and communication
service tasks have direct implications on the network throughput. Using tools
from stochastic geometry (SG), we derive several system design and planning
insights for deploying such networks and demonstrate how efficient radar
detection can augment the communication throughput in a JRC system.
Specifically, we provide a generalized analytical framework to maximize the
network throughput by optimizing JRC parameters such as the
exploration/exploitation duty cycle, the radar bandwidth, the transmit power,
and the pulse repetition interval. The analysis is further extended to
monostatic radar conditions, which is a special case in our framework. The
theoretical results are experimentally validated through Monte Carlo
simulations. Our analysis highlights that for a larger bistatic range, lower
operating bandwidth and a higher duty cycle must be employed to maximize the
network throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a reduced success in radar
detection due to higher clutter density deteriorates the overall network
throughput. Finally, we show peak reliability of 70% of the JRC link metrics
for a single bistatic transceiver configuration.

that can produce high-resolution and reproducible images. However, a long
scanning time is required for high-quality MR images, which leads to exhaustion
and discomfort of patients, inducing more artefacts due to voluntary movements
of the patients and involuntary physiological movements. To accelerate the
scanning process, methods by k-space undersampling and deep learning based
reconstruction have been popularised. This work introduced SwinMR, a novel Swin
transformer based method for fast MRI reconstruction. The whole network
consisted of an input module (IM), a feature extraction module (FEM) and an
output module (OM). The IM and OM were 2D convolutional layers and the FEM was
composed of a cascaded of residual Swin transformer blocks (RSTBs) and 2D
convolutional layers. The RSTB consisted of a series of Swin transformer layers
(STLs). The shifted windows multi-head self-attention (W-MSA/SW-MSA) of STL was
performed in shifted windows rather than the multi-head self-attention (MSA) of
the original transformer in the whole image space. A novel multi-channel loss
was proposed by using the sensitivity maps, which was proved to reserve more
textures and details. We performed a series of comparative studies and ablation
studies in the Calgary-Campinas public brain MR dataset and conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment in the Multi-modal Brain Tumour Segmentation
Challenge 2017 dataset. The results demonstrate our SwinMR achieved
high-quality reconstruction compared with other benchmark methods, and it shows
great robustness with different undersampling masks, under noise interruption

considered: sparse modeling and robust regression. The popular minimax concave
(MC) penalty for sparse modeling subtracts, from the $\ell_1$ norm, its Moreau
envelope, inducing nearly unbiased estimates and thus yielding remarkable
performance enhancements. To extend it to underdetermined linear systems, we
propose the projective minimax concave penalty using the projection onto the
input subspace, where the Moreau-enhancement effect is restricted to the
subspace for preserving the overall convexity. We also present a novel concept
of stable outlier-robust regression which distinguishes noise and outlier
explicitly. The LiMES model encompasses those two specific examples as well as
two other applications: stable principal component pursuit and robust
classification. The LiMES function involved in the model is an ``additively
nonseparable'' weakly convex function but is defined with the Moreau envelope
returning the minimum of a ``separable'' convex function. This mixed nature of
separability and nonseparability allows an application of the LiMES model to
the underdetermined case with an efficient algorithmic implementation. Two
linear/affine operators play key roles in the model: one corresponds to the
projection mentioned above and the other takes care of robust
regression/classification. A necessary and sufficient condition for convexity
of the smooth part of the objective function is studied. Numerical examples
show the efficacy of LiMES in applications to sparse modeling and robust
regression.

for accurate search is too high, the community turned to the research of
approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). Among them, graph-based algorithm
is one of the most important branches. Research by Fu et al. shows that the
algorithms based on Monotonic Search Network (MSNET), such as NSG and NSSG,
have achieved the state-of-the-art search performance in efficiency. The MSNET
is dedicated to achieving monotonic search with minimal out-degree of nodes to
pursue high efficiency. However, the current MSNET designs did not optimize the
probability of the monotonic search, and the lower bound of the probability is
only 50%. If they fail in monotonic search stage, they have to suffer
tremendous backtracking cost to achieve the required accuracy. This will cause
performance problems in search efficiency. To address this problem, we propose
(r,p)-MSNET, which achieves guaranteed probability on monotonic search. Due to
the high building complexity of a strict (r,p)-MSNET, we propose TBSG, which is

multihelicoid surface states (MHSSs) appear, as discussed in various systems
such as electronic and photonic ones. However, the topological nature and the
conditions for the appearance of the MHSSs have not been understood. Here we
show that MHSSs result from bulk-surface correspondence for the $Z_2$ monopole
charge Q, which cannot be defined as a local quantity associated with the Dirac
point, unlike the Z monopole charge characterizing Weyl points. The previously
known formula of Q turns out to be non-gauge-invariant and thus cannot
characterize the MHSSs. This shortcoming of the definition of Q is amended by
redefining Q as a global topological invariant in k-space. Surprisingly, the
newly defined Q, characterizing GT invariant gapless systems, is equal to the
G-protected $Z_2$ topological invariant v, which is nontrivial only in
T-breaking gapped systems. This global definition of Q automatically guarantees
the appearance of MHSSs even when the Dirac point splits into Weyl points or a
nodal ring by lowering the symmetry, as long as the GT symmetry is preserved. Q
can be simplified to symmetry-based indicators when two vertical Gs are
preserved, and filling-enforced topological crystalline insulators are
diagnosed in several cases when a T-breaking perturbation is induced. Material
candidate Li2B4O7 together with a list of space groups preserving MHSSs are
also proposed.

prediction models have attracted more and more attention from academia
communities and industry. However, most existing researches focus on reducing
model's prediction error but ignore the error caused by the uneven distribution
of spatial events within a region. In this paper, we study a region
partitioning problem, namely optimal grid size selection problem (OGSS), which
aims to minimize the real error of spatiotemporal prediction models by
selecting the optimal grid size. In order to solve OGSS, we analyze the upper
bound of real error of spatiotemporal prediction models and minimize the real
error by minimizing its upper bound. Through in-depth analysis, we find that
the upper bound of real error will decrease then increase when the number of
model grids increase from 1 to the maximum allowed value. Then, we propose two
algorithms, namely Ternary Search and Iterative Method, to automatically find
the optimal grid size. Finally, the experiments verify that the error of
prediction has the same trend as its upper bound, and the change trend of the
upper bound of real error with respect to the increase of the number of model
grids will decrease then increase. Meanwhile, in a case study, by selecting the
optimal grid size, the order dispatching results of a state-of-the-art
prediction-based algorithm can be improved up to 13.6%, which shows the
effectiveness of our methods on tuning the region partition for spatiotemporal
prediction models.

long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments T2K and NO$\nu$A. The tension
arises mostly due to the mismatch in the appearance data of the two
experiments. We explain how this tension arises based on $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$
and $\bar{\nu}_\mu \to \bar{\nu}_e$ oscillation probabilities. We define the
reference point of vacuum oscillation, maximal $\theta_{23}$ and
$\delta_{CP}=0$ and compute the $\nu_e/\bar{\nu}_e$ appearance events for each
experiment. We then study the effects of deviating the unknown parameters from
the reference point and the compatibility of any given set of values of unknown
parameters with the data from T2K and NO$\nu$A. T2K observes a large excess in
the $\nu_e$ appearance event sample compared to the expected $\nu_e$ events at
the reference point, whereas \nova observes a moderate excess. The large excess
in T2K dictates that $\delta_{CP}$ be anchored at $-90^\circ$ and that
$\theta_{23}>\pi/4$ with a preference for normal hierarchy. The moderate excess
at NO$\nu$A leads to two degenerate solutions: A) NH,
$0<\delta_{CP}<180^\circ$, and $\theta_{23}>\pi/4$; B) IH,
$-180^\circ<\delta_{CP}<0$, and $\theta_{23}>\pi/4$. This is the main cause of
the tension between the two experiments. We have reviewed the status of three
beyond standard model (BSM) physics scenarios, (a) non-unitary mixing, (b)
Lorentz invariance violation and (c) non-standard neutrino interactions, to
resolve the tension.

are important both for fundamental tests of quantum physics and for emerging
quantum information technologies. However, they are vulnerable to dissipation.
It is known, that the Wigner functions negativity could exist only if the
overall quantum efficiency $\eta$ of the setup is higher than 1/2. Here we
prove that this condition is not only necessary but also a sufficient one: the
negativity always persists while this condition is fulfilled. At the same time,
in the case of bright (multi-photon) non-Gaussian quantum states, the
negativity dependence on $\eta$ is highly non-linear. With the loss of several
photons, it drops by orders of magnitude, hampering its experimental detection.

estimate the uncertainty in these outcomes, the uncertainty wrapper framework
has been proposed, which considers uncertainties related to model fit, input
quality, and scope compliance. Uncertainty wrappers use a decision tree
approach to cluster input quality related uncertainties, assigning inputs
strictly to distinct uncertainty clusters. Hence, a slight variation in only
one feature may lead to a cluster assignment with a significantly different
uncertainty. Our objective is to replace this with an approach that mitigates
hard decision boundaries of these assignments while preserving
interpretability, runtime complexity, and prediction performance. Five
approaches were selected as candidates and integrated into the uncertainty
wrapper framework. For the evaluation based on the Brier score, datasets for a
pedestrian detection use case were generated using the CARLA simulator and
YOLOv3. All integrated approaches achieved a softening, i.e., smoothing, of
uncertainty estimation. Yet, compared to decision trees, they are not so easy
to interpret and have higher runtime complexity. Moreover, some components of
the Brier score impaired while others improved. Most promising regarding the
Brier score were random forests. In conclusion, softening hard decision tree
boundaries appears to be a trade-off decision.

spacetime. The Vaidya metric describes a spherically symmetric object that
gains or loses mass, depending on a mass function $m(v)$ that can be freely

decreasing function. The first case can serve as a simple model for an
accreting black hole, the second case for a (Hawking) radiating black hole.
With a linear mass function the Vaidya metric admits a conformal Killing vector
field which, together with the spherical symmetry, gives us enough constants of
motion for analytically calculating the light-like geodesics. Both in the
accreting and in the radiating case, we first calculate the light-like

red-shift of light in coordinates in which the metric is manifestly conformally

challenges.Objective: This paper aims to contribute to this line of research by
confirming and extending previously characterized architecting harmonization
practices from Systems and Software Engineering, adopted in an
ultra-large-scale SoS. Method: We conducted a confirmatory case study on the
Square-Kilometre Array (SKA) project to evaluate and extend the findings of our
exploratory case on the LOFAR/LOFAR2.0 radio-telescope projects. In doing so, a
pre-study was conducted to map the findings of the previous study with respect
to the SKA context. A survey was then designed, through which the views of 46
SKA engineers were collected and analyzed. Results: The study confirmed in
various degrees the four practices identified in the exploratory case, and
provided further insights about them, namely: (1) the friction between
disciplines caused by long-term system requirements, and how they can be
ameliorated through intermediate, short-term requirements; (2) the way design
choices with a cross-cutting impact on multiple agile teams have an indirect
impact on the system architecture; (3) how these design choices are often
caused by the criteria that guided early system decomposition; (4) the
seemingly recurrent issue with the lack of details about the dynamic elements
of the interfaces; and (5) the use of machine-readable interface specifications
for aligning hardware/software development processes.

Contrary to metals where rapid dephasing of optical excitation via electronic
processes occurs, the sub-gap excitation in charge-transfer insulators has been
shown to couple to low-energy bosonic excitations. However, it is currently
unknown if the bosonic dressing field is composed of phonons or magnons. Here
we use the prototypical charge-transfer insulator NiO to demonstrate that 1.5
eV sub-gap optical excitation leads to a renormalised NiO band-gap in
combination with a significant reduction of the antiferromagnetic order. We
employ element-specific X-ray reflectivity at the FLASH free-electron laser to
demonstrate the reduction of the upper band-edge at the O 1s-2p core-valence
resonance (K-edge) whereas the antiferromagnetic order is probed via X-ray
magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) at the Ni 2p-3d resonance (L2-edge). Comparing
the transient XMLD spectral line shape to ground-state measurements allows us
to extract a spin temperature rise of 65 +/- 5 K for time delays longer than
400 fs while at earlier times a non-equilibrium spin state is formed. We
identify transient mid-gap states being formed during the first 200 fs
accompanied by a band-gap reduction lasting at least up to the maximum measured
time delay of 2.4 ps. Electronic structure calculations indicate that magnon
excitations significantly contribute to the reduction of the NiO band gap.

modified, leading to a variety of quantum transport and optical phenomena
caused by the emergent electromagnetic fields through the Berry phase. Among
others, the phase degree of freedom of the superposed waves is potentially
important for such modifications, but its effect has not been fully elucidated
thus far. Here we perform systematic theoretical analyses of magnetic and
topological properties of the multiple-$Q$ spin textures with the phase degree
of freedom. By introducing a hyperspace with an additional dimension
corresponding to the phase degree of freedom, we establish a generic framework
to deal with the phase shift in the multiple-$Q$ spin textures. Applying the
framework to the two-dimensional 3$Q$ spin textures, we clarify the complete
topological phase diagram while changing the phase and magnetization, which
depends on the types of the superposed waves. We also study the
three-dimensional 4$Q$ spin textures and clarify even richer topological phase
diagrams. In particular, we find novel topological phase transitions associated
with the previously unidentified Dirac strings on which the hedgehogs and
antihedgehogs cause pair creation and fusion. Moreover, we demonstrate that

the most striking of which is a resistivity that increases linearly with

this behavior across a spectrum of correlated metals - both single- and
multi-band, with either dominant spin and/or charge fluctuations, of varying
levels of disorder or inhomogeneity and in proximity to a quantum critical

that is independent of the specifics of any material. Strongly anisotropic
(momentum-dependent) scattering can generate $B$-linear magnetoresistance but
only at intermediate field strengths. At high enough fields, the
magnetoresistance must eventually saturate. Here, we consider the ultimate
limit of such anisotropy, a region or regions on the Fermi surface that impede
all orbital (cyclotron) motion through them, but whose imposition can be
modelled nonetheless through a modified Boltzmann theoretical treatment.
Application of the proposed theorem suggests that the realization of

as star formation and radial gas migration within a galaxy. Large IFU surveys
allow for detailed studies of these radial variations, with recent observations
detecting central dips in the metallicity, which may trace the impact of
various evolutionary processes. However, the origin of these dips has not been
conclusively determined, with suggestions that they may be diagnostic
dependent. In this paper, we use the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey to investigate
whether the observed dips represent genuine decreases in the central
metallicity, or if they could be an artefact of the diagnostic used. Using a
sub-sample of 758 local star-forming galaxies at low inclinations, we
investigate in detail the impact of using different strong line diagnostics on
the shapes of the returned profiles, and the prevalence of dips. We find no
clear evidence of the dips being caused by changing values of the ionisation
parameter within galaxies. To investigate physical causes, we explore both
global and spatially-resolved parameters, finding that galaxies exhibiting
central dips in the O3N2 metallicity profile have on average lower H$\alpha$EW
values out to $R/R_\rm{e} \sim 1.5$, and higher values of D$_N$(4000) in the
central regions. We additionally find a higher prevalence of dips in galaxies
with high stellar mass, and lower values of global specific star formation
rate, suggesting a possible link to central quenching. Nevertheless, these
results are dependent on the diagnostic used, suggesting caution should be
taken when interpreting observed features in galaxy metallicity gradients.

due to the limited memory and computation resources. We aim to design efficient
neural networks for heterogeneous devices including CPU and GPU, by exploiting
the redundancy in feature maps, which has rarely been investigated in neural
architecture design. For CPU-like devices, we propose a novel CPU-efficient
Ghost (C-Ghost) module to generate more feature maps from cheap operations.
Based on a set of intrinsic feature maps, we apply a series of linear
transformations with cheap cost to generate many ghost feature maps that could
fully reveal information underlying intrinsic features. The proposed C-Ghost
module can be taken as a plug-and-play component to upgrade existing
convolutional neural networks. C-Ghost bottlenecks are designed to stack
C-Ghost modules, and then the lightweight C-GhostNet can be easily established.
We further consider the efficient networks for GPU devices. Without involving
too many GPU-inefficient operations (e.g.,, depth-wise convolution) in a
building stage, we propose to utilize the stage-wise feature redundancy to
formulate GPU-efficient Ghost (G-Ghost) stage structure. The features in a
stage are split into two parts where the first part is processed using the
original block with fewer output channels for generating intrinsic features,
and the other are generated using cheap operations by exploiting stage-wise
redundancy. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed C-Ghost module and the G-Ghost stage. C-GhostNet and G-GhostNet
can achieve the optimal trade-off of accuracy and latency for CPU and GPU,
respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/CV-Backbones.

to quantum complex vector spaces and quantum probability models, we showed that
quantization itself, with words as quanta, is relevant and potentially
important to human cognition. In the present work, we build on this result, and
introduce a powerful radiation quantization scheme for human cognition. We show
that the lack of independence of the Bose-Einstein statistics compared to the
Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics can be explained by the presence of a 'meaning
dynamics', which causes words to be attracted to the same words. And so words
clump together in the same states, a phenomenon well known for photons in the
early years of quantum mechanics, leading to fierce disagreements between
Planck and Einstein. Using a simple example, we introduce all the elements to
get a better and detailed view of this 'meaning dynamics', such as micro and
macro states, and Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac numbers and
weights, and compare this example and its graphs, with the radiation
quantization scheme of a Winnie the Pooh story, also with its graphs. By
connecting a concept directly to human experience, we show that entanglement is
a necessity for preserving the 'meaning dynamics' we identified, and it becomes
clear in what way Fermi-Dirac addresses human memory. Within the human mind, as
a crucial aspect of memory, in spaces with internal parameters, identical words
can nevertheless be assigned different states and hence realize locally and
contextually the necessary distinctiveness, structured by a Pauli exclusion
principle, for human thought to thrive.

to decide whether a graph has an (s,t)-path of length at least dist_G(s,t)+k
(where dist_G(s,t) denotes the length of a shortest path from s to t).
Bez\'akov\'a et al. proved that on undirected graphs the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) by providing an algorithm of running time 2^{O
(k)} n. Further, they left the parameterized complexity of the problem on
directed graphs open. Our first main result establishes a connection between
Longest Detour on directed graphs and 3-Disjoint Paths on directed graphs.
Using these new insights, we design a 2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)} time algorithm for the
problem on directed planar graphs. Further, the new approach yields a
significantly faster FPT algorithm on undirected graphs.
  In the second variant of Longest Path, namely Longest Path Above Diameter,
the task is to decide whether the graph has a path of length at least diam(G)+k
(diam(G) denotes the length of a longest shortest path in a graph G). We obtain
dichotomy results about Longest Path Above Diameter on undirected and directed
graphs. For (un)directed graphs, Longest Path Above Diameter is NP-complete
even for k=1. However, if the input undirected graph is 2-connected, then the
problem is FPT. On the other hand, for 2-connected directed graphs, we show
that Longest Path Above Diameter is solvable in polynomial time for each
k\in{1,\dots, 4} and is NP-complete for every k\geq 5. The parameterized
complexity of Longest Path Above Diameter on general directed graphs remains an

GNNs are usually trained in an end-to-end fashion, leading to highly

models is a desirable objective of efficient architecture development. This
paper proposes an efficient transformer architecture that adjusts the inference
computational cost adaptively with desired inference latency speedup. The
proposed encoder model can work with fewer Floating Point Operations (FLOPs)
than the original Transformer architecture. In fine-tuning phase, the proposed
method detects more important hidden sequence elements (word-vectors) in each
encoder layer by a proposed Attention Context Contribution (ACC) metric. It
eliminates the less important word-vectors based on a new strategy. A
mathematical inference speedup analysis is proposed to estimate the speedup
accurately to adjust the latency and computational cost of fine-tuning and
inference phases. After the fine-tuning phase, by the method offline-tuning
property, the inference latency of the model can be adjusted in a wide range of
inference speedup selections. The proposed method is applied to the BERTbase
model for evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most of the word-vectors
in higher BERT encoder layers have less contribution to the subsequent layers;
hence, they can be eliminated to improve the inference latency. Experimental
results on extensive sentiment analysis, classification, and regression
benchmarks like GLUE showed that the method is effective in various datasets.
The proposed method improves the inference latency of BERTbase by up to 4.8
times with less than 0.75% accuracy drop on average.

Measuring the tidal deformation of the planet would allow us to estimate the
second degree fluid Love number and gain insight into the planet's internal
structure. Moreover, measuring the tidal decay timescale would allow us to
estimate the stellar tidal quality factor, which is key to constraining stellar
physics.
  We obtained 12 transit light curves of WASP-103b with the CHEOPS to estimate
the tidal deformation and tidal decay of this extreme system. We modelled the
high-precision CHEOPS transit light curves together with systematic
instrumental noise using multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression informed
by a set of instrumental parameters. To model the tidal deformation, we used a
parametrisation model which allowed us to determine the second degree fluid
Love number of the planet. We combined our light curves with previously
observed transits of WASP-103b with HST and Spitzer.
  We estimate the radial Love number of WASP-103b to be $h_f =
1.59^{+0.45}_{-0.53}$. This is the first time that the tidal deformation is
directly detected (at $3\, \sigma$) from the transit light curve of an
exoplanet. Combining the transit times derived from CHEOPS, with the other
transit times available in the literature, we find no significant orbital
period variation for WASP-103b. However, the data show a hint of an orbital
period increase instead of a decrease, as is expected for tidal decay. This
could be either due to a visual companion star if this star is bound, the
Applegate effect, or a statistical artefact.
  The estimated Love number of WASP-103b is similar to Jupiter's. This will
allow us to constrain the internal structure and composition of WASP-103b,
which could provide clues on the inflation of hot Jupiters. (Abridged)

specified motion. They are fundamental components of macroscopic machines.
Interlocking microrotors similarly constitute key elements toward feasible
micromachinery. Their assembly, positioning and control is a challenge at
microscale, where noise is ubiquituous. Here, we show the assembly and control
of a family of self-spinning cogwheels with varying teeth numbers and study
interlocking mechanisms in systems of multiple cogwheels. The cogwheels are
autonomous and active, with teeth formed by colloidal microswimmers that power
the structure, and control its rotation rate. Leveraging the angular momentum
of light with optical vortices, we control the direction of rotation of the
cogwheels. We study pairs of interlocking cogwheels, that roll over each other
in a random walk and curvature-dependent mobility. We leverage this feature to
achieve self-positioning of cogwheels on structures with variable curvature and
program microbots, notably demonstrating the ability to pick up, displace and
release a load. This work highlights untapped opportunities of manufacturing at
microscale using self-positioning components and constitutes an important step
towards autonomous and programmable microbots.

domains, including human tracking, health monitoring, and autonomous driving,
for their unobtrusive nature and high range accuracy. These capabilities,
however, if used for malicious purposes, could also result in serious security
and privacy issues. For example, a user's daily life could be secretly
monitored by a spy radar. Hence, there is a strong urge to develop systems that
can detect and locate such spy radars. In this paper, we propose $Radar^2$, a
practical system for passive spy radar detection and localization using a
single commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mmWave radar. Specifically, we propose a
novel \textit{Frequency Component Detection} method to detect the existence of
mmWave signals, distinguish between mmWave radar and WiGig signals using a
waveform classifier based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), and localize
spy radars using triangulation based on the detector's observations at multiple
anchor points. Not only does $Radar^2$ work for different types of mmWave
radar, but it can also detect and localize multiple radars simultaneously.
Finally, we performed extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and
robustness of $Radar^2$ in various settings. Our evaluation results show that
the radar detection rate is above 96$\%$ and the localization error is within
0.3m. The results also reveal that $Radar^2$ is robust against various
environmental factors (e.g., room layout and human activities).

understand the behaviour of the VQA models before adopting their results. In
this paper, we introduce an interpretability approach for VQA models by
generating counterfactual images. Specifically, the generated image is supposed
to have the minimal possible change to the original image and leads the VQA

of birds to glide for extended periods of time. Simplifying the wing or fins to
a foil, morphing refers to the ability of the foil to change its camber
smoothly, without sharp bends on the foil surface. This allows precise control
over flow separation and vortex shedding. Compared to conventional
trailing-edge extensions or flaps, used in rudders and elevators in submarines
and ships, morphing foils provide better control of thrust and lift
characteristics. This study aims at understanding the importance of the
morphing of foil combined with a sinusoidal heaving motion on thrust
generation. A two-dimensional variational stabilized Petrov-Galerkin moving
mesh framework is utilized for modelling the incompressible low Reynolds number
flow across the flapping foil. The morphing motion is characterized by the
extent of morphing, measured as an angle of deviation from the initial camber,
and the point of initiation of morphing on the foil as a percentage of its
chord length. The effect of the foil morphing and the heaving motion on the
propulsive performance are investigated. The extent of morphing is varied from
-30 deg and 30 deg, and the point of initiation ranges from 15% to 50% of the
chord. The Reynolds and Strouhal numbers for the study are 1100 and 0.2,
respectively. The results from the current work can pave the way for enhanced
engineering designs in bio-mimetics and give insights on design conditions for
optimal thrust performance.

people share their photos on these networks. Automatic recognition and tagging
of people's photos on these networks has raised privacy preservation issues and
users seek methods for hiding their identities from these algorithms.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are shown to be very powerful in
generating face images in high diversity and also in editing face images. In
this paper, we propose a Generative Mask-guided Face Image Manipulation (GMFIM)
model based on GANs to apply imperceptible editing to the input face image to
preserve the privacy of the person in the image. Our model consists of three
main components: a) the face mask module to cut the face area out of the input
image and omit the background, b) the GAN-based optimization module for
manipulating the face image and hiding the identity and, c) the merge module
for combining the background of the input image and the manipulated
de-identified face image. Different criteria are considered in the loss
function of the optimization step to produce high-quality images that are as
similar as possible to the input image while they cannot be recognized by AFR
systems. The results of the experiments on different datasets show that our
model can achieve better performance against automated face recognition systems
in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods and it catches a higher attack
success rate in most experiments from a total of 18. Moreover, the generated
images of our proposed model have the highest quality and are more pleasing to
human eyes.

by this school is about topological surfaces with an intrinsic metric for which
we can define a notion of curvature, which is a Radon measure. This class of
surfaces has good convergence properties and is remarkably stable with respect
to various geometrical constructions (gluing etc.). It includes polyhedral
surfaces as well as Riemannian surfaces of class $C^2$, and both of these

particles with a de Broglie wavelength of $\sim$kpc, above which it behaves
like cold dark matter (CDM). Due to this, FDM suppresses the growth of
structure on small scales, which delays the onset of the cosmic dawn (CD) and
the subsequent epoch of reionization (EoR). This leaves potential signatures in
the sky averaged 21-cm signal (global), as well as in the 21-cm fluctuations,
which can be sought for with ongoing and future 21-cm global and intensity
mapping experiments. To do so reliably, it is crucial to include effects such
as the dark-matter/baryon relative velocity and Lyman-Werner star-formation
feedback, which also act as delaying mechanisms, as well as CMB and \lya
heating effects, which can significantly change the amplitude and timing of the
signal, depending on the strength of X-ray heating sourced by the remnants of
the first stars. Here we model the 21-cm signal in FDM cosmologies across CD
and EoR using a modified version of the public code 21cmvFAST that accounts for
all these additional effects, and is directly interfaced with the Boltzmann
code CLASS so that degeneracies between cosmological and astrophysical
parameters can be fully explored. We examine the prospects to distinguish
between the CDM and FDM models and forecast joint astrophysical, cosmological
and FDM parameter constraints achievable with intensity mapping experiments
such as HERA and global signal experiments like EDGES. We find that HERA will
be able to detect FDM particle masses up to $m_{\rm FDM}\! \sim
\!10^{-19}\,{\rm eV}\!-\!10^{-18}\,{\rm eV}$, depending on foreground
assumptions, despite the mitigating effect of the delaying and heating
mechanisms included in the analysis.

the vertical so that they swim upwards. In a suspension of many squirmers, they
also interact hydrodynamically via flow fields that are initiated by their
swimming motion and by gravity. Swimming under the combined action of flow
field vorticity and gravitational torque is called gyrotaxis. Using the method
of multi-particle collision dynamics, we perform hydrodynamic simulations of a
many-squirmer system floating above the bottom surface. Due to gyrotaxis they
exhibit pronounced cluster formation with increasing gravitational torque. The
clusters are more volatile at low values but compactify to smaller clusters at
larger torques. The mean distance between clusters is mainly controlled by the
gravitational torque and not the global density. Furthermore, we observe that
neutral squirmers form clusters more easily, whereas pullers require larger
gravitational torques due to their additional force-dipole flow fields. We do
not observe clustering for pusher squirmers. Adding a rotlet dipole to the
squirmer flow field induces swirling clusters. At high gravitational strengths,
the hydrodynamic interactions with the no-slip boundary create an additional
vertical alignment for neutral squirmers, which also supports cluster
formation.

3D maps from images in many domains including environmental monitoring.
However, SfM techniques are often confounded in visually repetitive
environments as they rely primarily on globally distinct image features.
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques offer a potential
solution in visually repetitive environments since they use local feature
matching, but SLAM approaches work best with wide-angle cameras that are often
unsuitable for documenting the environmental system of interest. We resolve
this issue by proposing a dual-camera SLAM approach that uses a forward facing
wide-angle camera for localization and a downward facing narrower angle,
high-resolution camera for documentation. Video frames acquired by the forward
facing camera video are processed using a standard SLAM approach providing a
trajectory of the imaging system through the environment which is then used to
guide the registration of the documentation camera images. Fragmentary maps,
initially produced from the documentation camera images via monocular SLAM, are
subsequently scaled and aligned with the localization camera trajectory and
finally subjected to a global optimization procedure to produce a unified,
refined map. An experimental comparison with several state-of-the-art SfM
approaches shows the dual-camera SLAM approach to perform better in repetitive
environmental systems based on select samples of ground control point markers.

dark matter density profiles such as the Cold Dark Matter (CDM), Scalar Field
Dark Matter (SFDM), and the Universal Rotation Curve (URC) from the Burkert
profile. To achieve this goal, we used how the positional angles are measured
by Ishihara et al. method based on Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT) on the optical
metric. With the help of the non-asymptotic form of the GBT, the longitudinal
angle difference is also calculated. First, we find the emergence of apparent
divergent terms on the said profiles, which indicates that the spacetime
describing the black hole-dark matter combination is non-asymptotic. We showed
that these apparent divergent terms vanish when the distance of the source and
receiver are astronomically distant from the black hole. Using the current
observational data in the Milky Way and M87 galaxies, we find interesting
behaviors of how the weak deflection angle varies with the impact parameter,
which gives us some hint on how dark matter interacts with the null particles
for each dark matter density profile. We conclude that since these deviations
are evident near the dark matter core radius, the weak deflection angle offers
a better alternative for dark matter detection than using the deviation from
the black hole shadow. With the DM profiles explored in this study, we find
that SFDM is the most difficult to detect, while the easiest is the URC
profile. With the dark matter profiles explored in this study, we find that the
variation of the values for weak deflection angle strongly depends on the dark
matter mass on a particular profile.

arise from the theory of holographic algorithms, which was originally inspired
by concepts from quantum computation. Here, we employ quantum information
theory to explain existing results about holant problems in a concise way and
to derive two new dichotomies: one for a new family of problems, which we call
Holant$^+$, and, building on this, a full dichotomy for Holant$^c$. These two
families of holant problems assume the availability of certain unary constraint
functions -- the two pinning functions in the case of Holant$^c$, and four
functions in the case of Holant$^+$ -- and allow arbitrary sets of
algebraic-complex valued constraint functions otherwise. The dichotomy for
Holant$^+$ also applies when inputs are restricted to instances defined on
planar graphs. In proving these complexity classifications, we derive an
original result about entangled quantum states.

time scales to non-Maxwellian quasi-equilibria, which, nevertheless, have a
universal form, with dependence on initial conditions retained only via an
infinite set of Casimir invariants enforcing phase-volume conservation. These
are distributions derived by Lynden-Bell (1967) via a statistical-mechanical
entropy-maximisation procedure, assuming perfect mixing of phase-space
elements. To show that these equilibria are reached dynamically, one must
derive an effective `collisionless collision integral' for which they are fixed
points -- unique and inevitable provided the integral has an appropriate
H-theorem. We describe how such collision integrals are derived and what
assumptions are required for them to have a closed form, how to prove the
H-theorems for them, and why, for a system carrying sufficiently large
electric-fluctuation energy, collisionless relaxation should be fast. It is
suggested that collisionless dynamics may favour maximising entropy locally in
phase space before converging to global maximum-entropy states. Relaxation due
to interspecies interaction is examined, leading, inter alia, to spontaneous
transient generation of electron currents. The formalism also allows efficient
recovery of `true' collision integrals for both classical and quantum plasmas.

formation in other systems, giving us new constraints on planet formation
processes. Meanwhile, studies of our own Solar System rely on constraints
derived in a completely different way. However, it is still unclear what
features the Solar System's disk could have produced during its gas phase. By
running 2D isothermal hydro-simulations and a dust evolution model, we derive
synthetic images at 1.3 mm wavelength using the radiative transfer code
RADMC3D. We find that the embedded multiple giant planets strongly perturb the
radial gas velocities of the disk, creating traffic jams in the dust. They
produce over-densities different from the ones created by pressure traps and
located away from the planets' positions in the disk. By deriving the images at
1.3mm from these dust distributions, we show that the traffic jams, observable
with a high resolution, further blur the link between the number of gaps and
rings in disks and the number of embedded planets. We additionally show that a
system of 3 compact giant planets does not automatically produce bright outer
rings at large radii in the disk. This means that high resolution observations
of disks of various sizes are needed to distinguish between different giant
planet formation scenarios during the disk phase, where the giants form either
in the outer regions of the disks or in the inner regions. Finally, we find
that, even when the dust temperature is determined self-consistently, the dust
masses derived observationally might be off by up to a factor of ten compared
to the dust contained in our simulations due to the creation of optically thick
regions. Our study clearly shows that in addition to the constraints from
exoplanets and the Solar System, ALMA has the power to constrain different
stages of planet formation already during the first few million years.

The acceleration appears to be a consequence of the entropy associated with the

correction term is considered, we study the effects of including a subdominant
power-law term within a thermodynamically admissible entropic-force model. The

analyze the various types of behaviors, and we compare the performance of
thermodynamically consistent entropic-force models with regard to available
supernovae data by providing appropriate constraints for optimizing alternative
entropies and temperatures of the Hubble screen. The novelty of our work is
that the analysis is based on a entropy scaling with an arbitrary power of the
Hubble radius, instead of a specific entropy. This allows us to conclude on
various models at once, compare them, and conserve the scaling exponent as a
parameter to be fitted with observational data, thus providing information
about the form of the actual cosmological entropy and temperature. We show that

gives 97.8$\%$ for $|\Delta\nu|< 6000~ \rm km/s$ and 97.9$\%$ for $|\Delta\nu|<
12000~ \rm km/s$. Hence, FNet provides similar accuracy to \code{QuasarNET},
but it is applicable for a wider range of SDSS spectra, especially for those
missing the clear emission lines exploited by \code{QuasarNET}. These
properties of \code{FNet}, together with the fast predictive power of machine
learning, allow \code{FNet} to be a more accurate alternative for the pipeline
redshift estimator and can make it practical in the upcoming catalogs to reduce
the number of spectra to visually inspect.

they are accreting material. This process is essential in the formation of
Sun-like stars. Although often described with simple and static models, the
accretion process is inherently time variable. Our aim is to examine the
accretion process of the low-mass young stellar object CR Cha on a wide range
of timescales from minutes to a decade by analyzing both photometric and
spectroscopic observations from 2006, 2018, and 2019. We carried out period
analysis on the light curves of CR Cha from the TESS mission and the ASAS-SN
and the ASAS-3 databases. We studied the color variations of the system using
$I,J,H,K$-band photometry obtained contemporaneously with the TESS observing
window. We analyzed the amplitude, timescale, and the morphology of the
accretion tracers found in a series of high-resolution spectra obtained in 2006
with the AAT/UCLES, in 2018 with the HARPS, and in 2019 with the ESPRESSO and
the FEROS spectrographs. All photometric data reveal periodic variations
compatible with a 2.327 days rotational period, which is stable in the system
over decades. Moreover, the ASAS-SN and ASAS-3 data hint at a long-term
brightening by 0.2 mag, between 2001 and 2008, and of slightly less than 0.1
mag in the 2015 - 2018 period. The near-infrared color variations can be
explained by either changing accretion rate or changes in the inner disk
structure. Our results show that the amplitude of the variations in the
H$\alpha$ emission increases on timescales from hours to days/weeks, after
which it stays similar even when looking at decadal timescales. On the other
hand, we found significant morphological variations on yearly/decadal
timescales, indicating that the different physical mechanisms responsible for
the line profile changes, such as accretion or wind, are present to varying
degrees at different times.

radio emission from cosmic-ray air showers at the location of the South Pole.
The fraction of Askaryan emission relative to the total emission is determined
by the polarization of the radio signal at the time of its peak amplitude. We
find that the relative Askaryan fraction has a radial dependence increasing
with the distance from the shower axis -- with a plateau around the Cherenkov
ring. We further find that the Askaryan fraction depends on shower parameters
like zenith angle and the distance to the shower maximum. While these
dependencies are in agreement with earlier studies, they have not yet been
utilized to determine the depth of the shower maximum, $X_\mathrm{max}$, based
on the Askaryan fraction. Fitting these dependencies with a polynomial model,
we arrive at an alternative method to reconstruct $X_\mathrm{max}$ using a
measurement of the Askaryan fraction and shower geometry as input. Depending on
the measurement uncertainties of the Askaryan fraction, this method provides a
measurement of $X_{\mathrm max}$ with a resolution similar to other methods of
reconstructing $X_{\mathrm max}$ from radio observables. Although existing
template methods give superior resolution, they are more computationally
intensive. Consequently, the use of polarization to extract the Askaryan
fraction of the radio signal should be considered as an additional input
observable in future generations of template-fitting reconstruction and other
multivariate approaches for measuring $X_{\mathrm max}$.

enhancement of potassium and the depletion of magnesium, can be explained in
terms of an earlier generation of stars polluting the presently observed ones.
It was shown that the potential range of temperatures and densities of the
polluting sites depends on the strength of a few number of critical reaction
rates. The reaction has been identified as one of these important reactions.
[Purpose] The key ingredient for evaluating the thermonuclear reaction rate is
the strength of the resonances which, at low energy, are proportional to their
proton width. Therefore the goal of this work is to determine the proton widths
of unbound 31P states. [Method] States in 31P were studied at the
Maier-Leibnitz-Laboratorium using the one-proton transfer reaction. Deuterons
were detected with the Q3D magnetic spectrometer. Angular distribution and
spectroscopic factors were extracted for 27 states, and proton widths and
resonance strengths were calculated for the unbound states. [Results] Several
unbound states have been observed for the first time in a one-proton transfer
reaction. Above 20 MK, the reaction rate is now entirely estimated from the
observed properties of states. The reaction rate uncertainty from all
resonances other than the resonance has been reduced down to less than a factor
of two above that temperature. The unknown spin and parity of the resonance
dominates the uncertainty in the rate in the relevant temperature range.
[Conclusion] The remaining source of uncertainty on the reaction rate comes
from the unknown spin and parity of the resonance which can change the reaction
rate by a factor of ten in the temperature range of interest.

the microscopic structure in such a way the intracellular medium can only be

kinds of local cells that are obtained by upscaling methods. The homogenization
method is based on a power series expansion which allows determining the
macroscopic (homogenized) bidomain model from the microscopic bidomain problem
at each structural level. First, we use the two-scale asymptotic expansion to
homogenize the extracellular problem. Then, we apply a three-scale asymptotic
expansion in the intracellular problem to obtain its homogenized equation at
two levels. The first upscaling level of the intracellular structure yields the
mesoscopic equation and the second step of the homogenization leads to obtain
the intracellular homogenized equation. Both the mesoscopic and microscopic
information is obtained by homogenization to capture local characteristics
inside the cardiac tissue structure. Finally, we obtain the macroscopic
bidomain model and the heart domain coincides with the intracellular medium and
extracellular one, which are two inter-penetrating and superimposed continua
connected at each point by the cardiac cellular membrane. The interest of the
proposed method comes from the fact that it combines microscopic and mesoscopic
characteristics to obtain a macroscopic description of the electrical behavior
of the heart.

deposition on an appropriate substrate, have been recently predicted to exhibit
very strong antiferromagnetic superexchange and to have large potential for
ambient pressure superconductivity if doped to an optimal level. It was shown
that AgF2 could become a magnetic glue based superconductor with a critical
superconducting temperature approaching 200 K at optimum doping. In the current
work we calculate the optimum doping to correspond to 14% of holes per formula
unit, i.e. quite similar to that for oxocuprates II. Furthermore, using DFT
calculations we show that flat AgF2 single layers can indeed be doped to a
controlled extent using a recently proposed chemical capacitor setup. Hole
doping associated with formation of Ag III proves to be difficult to achieve in
the setup explored in this work as it falls at verge of charge stability of
fluoride anions and does not affect the d x2 minus y2 manifold . However, in
the case of electron doping, manipulation of different factors, such as number
of dopant layers and the thickness of the separator, permits fine tuning of the
doping level - and concomitantly TC - all the way from underdoped to overdoped
regime (in a similar manner as chemical doping for the Nd2CuO4 analogue).

the monomers are treated classically via the Ehrenfest equations of motion. In
addition, the system is thermalized by assuming that the monomers are subject
to Brownian fluctuations modeled by the Langevin equation. Charge coupling to
the monomer rotations localizes the particle into a Landau polaron, while the
thermal fluctuations of the monomers causes polaron dynamics. The emergent
low-energy scale of the model is the polaron reorganization energy, $E_r$, and
thus $T_r = E_r/k_B$ is a convenient scale for the low-temperature dynamics. We
investigate two types of dynamics -- both relevant for temperatures $T < T_r$.
In the lower temperature regime the system remains in the same quasidiabatic
state, corresponding to activationless polaron diffusion as the polaron crawls
stochastically along the chain. As the temperature is raised, however, there is
a cross-over to an additional activated transfer process which corresponds to
hopping between diabatic states. We show that these processes exhibit
Landau-Zener type dynamics. We note that as our model is general, it equally
applies to exciton-polaron (i.e., energy) transport in conjugated polymers, and
to charge and exciton polaron transport in quasi one-dimensional molecular

data, the classification of each fertile and infertile egg is 50 image data.
Chicken egg image data became input in image processing, with the initial

image according to the object. The cropped image is repaired using image
preprocessing with grayscaling and image enhancement methods. This method
(image enhancement) used two combination methods: contrast limited adaptive
histogram equalization (CLAHE) and histogram equalization (HE). The improved
image becomes the input for feature extraction using the FOS method. The FOS
uses five parameters, namely mean, entropy, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
The five parameters entered into the SVM classifier method to identify the
fertility of chicken eggs. The results of these experiments, the method
proposed in the identification process has a success percentage of 84.57%.
Thus, the implementation of this method can be used as a reference for future

control of industrial furnaces. However, measurement uncertainty is a risk for
such a critical parameter. Certain instrumental and environmental errors must
be considered when using spectral-band radiation thermometry techniques, such
as the uncertainty in the emissivity of the target surface, reflected radiation
from surrounding objects, or atmospheric absorption and emission, to name a
few. Undesired contributions to measured radiation can be isolated using
measurement models, also known as error-correction models. This paper presents
a methodology for budgeting significant sources of error and uncertainty during
temperature measurements in a petrochemical furnace scenario. A continuous
monitoring system is also presented, aided by a deep-learning-based measurement
correction model, to allow domain experts to analyze the furnace's operation in
real-time. To validate the proposed system's functionality, a real-world
application case in a petrochemical plant is presented. The proposed solution
demonstrates the viability of precise industrial furnace monitoring, thereby
increasing operational security and improving the efficiency of such
energy-intensive systems.

easy to generate and hard to detect, these attacks pose a security breach that
many suggested defenses try to mitigate. However, the evaluation of the effect
of attacks and defenses commonly relies on traditional classification metrics,
without adequate adaptation to adversarial scenarios. Most of these metrics are
accuracy-based, and therefore may have a limited scope and low distinctive
power. Other metrics do not consider the unique characteristics of neural
networks functionality, or measure the effect of the attacks indirectly (e.g.,
through the complexity of their generation). In this paper, we present two
metrics which are specifically designed to measure the effect of attacks, or
the recovery effect of defenses, on the output of neural networks in multiclass
classification tasks. Inspired by the normalized discounted cumulative gain and
the reciprocal rank metrics used in information retrieval literature, we treat
the neural network predictions as ranked lists of results. Using additional
information about the probability of the rank enabled us to define novel
metrics that are suited to the task at hand. We evaluate our metrics using
various attacks and defenses on a pretrained VGG19 model and the ImageNet

algorithms for these problems are also of great importance in terms of
determination of the shortest path in an open area where the road will pass in
the field of civil engineering, or route determination of manned or unmanned

path finding problems in the raw terrains are also important for manned and

land-based, the method can be applied to almost all problem types of similar
nature. The approach used in the study can be briefly described as the
mechanical analysis of a surface transformed into a structural load bearing

the shortest path connecting two points can be realized by following the
stress-strain values that will occur by moving the points away from each other
or by following a linear line that will be formed between two points during the
mechanical analysis. If the proposed approach is to be carried out with
multiple rigid body dynamics approaches instead of flexible bodies mechanics,
it can be carried out easily and very quickly by determining the shortest path
between two points or by tracking the forces. However, the proposed approach in
this study is presented by simulating examples of flexible bodies using FEM.

Spatiotemporal variability of oxygen distribution in the tumour
microenvironment contributes to cellular heterogeneity and to the emergence of
normoxic and hypoxic populations. Local levels of oxygen strongly affect the
response of tumours to the administration of different therapeutic modalities
and, more generally, to the phenomenon of resistance to treatments. Several
interventions have been proposed to improve tumour oxygenation, being the
elevation of the local temperature (hyperthermia) an important one. While other
factors such as the metabolic activity have to be considered, the proficiency
of the tumour vascular system is a key factor both for the tissue oxygenation
and for its temperature maps. Consequently, the interplay of these factors has
attracted considerable attention from the mathematical modelling perspective.
Here we put forward a transport-based system of partial differential equations
aimed at describing the dynamics of healthy and tumour cell subpopulations at
the microscale in a region placed between two blood vessels. By using this
model with diverse flow conditions, we analyse the oxygen and temperature
profiles that arise in different scenarios of vascular status, both during free
progression and under thermal therapy. We find that low oxygen levels are
associated to elevations of temperature in locations preferentially populated
by hypoxic cells, and hyperthermia-induced cell death, being strongly dependent
on blood flow, would only appear under highly disrupted conditions of the local
vasculature. This results in a noticeable effect of heat on hypoxic cells.
Additionally, when pronounced cell death occurs, it is followed by a
significant increase in the oxygen levels.

in the model of Merton (1971) and show that his self-financing condition is
misspecified both in discrete and continuous time. Our results invalidate
seminal contributions to the literature, including the budget equation of
Merton (1971), the option pricing formula of Black and Scholes (1973), the
continuous trading model of Harrison and Pliska (1981), and the binomial option
pricing model of Cox, Ross and Rubinstein (1979). We also show that Black and
Scholes (1973) and Harrison and Pliska (1981) implicitly assumed their
replication result.

problems (DA) solved by means of variational approaches and Kalman filter
algorithm. Recently, we presented a Domain Decomposition framework (we call it
DD-DA, for short) performing a decomposition of the whole physical domain along
space and time directions, and joining the idea of Schwarz' methods and
parallel in time approaches. For effective parallelization of DD-DA algorithms,
the computational load assigned to subdomains must be equally distributed.
Usually computational cost is proportional to the amount of data entities
assigned to partitions. Good quality partitioning also requires the volume of
communication during calculation to be kept at its minimum. In order to deal
with DD-DA problems where the observations are nonuniformly distributed and
general sparse, in the present work we employ a parallel load balancing
algorithm based on adaptive and dynamic defining of boundaries of DD -- which
is aimed to balance workload according to data location. We call it DyDD. As
the numerical model underlying DA problems arising from the so-called
discretize-then-optimize approach is the constrained least square model (CLS),
we will use CLS as a reference state estimation problem and we validate DyDD on
different scenarios.
