situations where humans and robots have to cross each other in narrow
corridors. In these cases, the robot has to make space for the human to pass.
From observation of human-human crossing behaviours, we isolated two main
factors in this avoiding behaviour: body rotation and sliding motion. We
implemented a robot controller able to vary these factors and explored how this
variation impacted on people's perception. Results from a within-participants
study involving 23 participants show that people prefer a robot rotating its
body when crossing them. Additionally, a sliding motion is rated as being
warmer. These results show the importance of social avoidance when interacting
with humans.

an extensive literature now offers differentially private solutions to a wide

systems often requires confronting details that the literature ignores or
abstracts away: users may contribute multiple records, the domain of possible
records may be unknown, and the eventual system must scale to large volumes of
data. Failure to carefully account for all three issues can severely impair a
system's quality and usability.
  We present Plume, a system built to address these problems. We describe a
number of sometimes subtle implementation issues and offer practical solutions

  Information Retrieval",,,,,"cs.IT cs.IR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces the problem of Private Information Retrieval with
Reusable and Single-use Side Information (PIR-RSSI). In this problem, one or
more remote servers store identical copies of a set of $K$ messages, and there
is a user that initially knows $M$ of these messages, and wants to privately
retrieve one other message from the set of $K$ messages. The objective is to
design a retrieval scheme in which the user downloads the minimum amount of
information from the server(s) while the identity of the message wanted by the
user and the identities of an $M_1$-subset of the $M$ messages known by the
user (referred to as reusable side information) are protected, but the
identities of the remaining $M_2=M-M_1$ messages known by the user (referred to
as single-use side information) do not need to be protected. The PIR-RSSI
problem reduces to the classical Private Information Retrieval (PIR) problem
when ${M_1=M_2=0}$, and reduces to the problem of PIR with Private Side
Information or PIR with Side Information when ${M_1\geq 1,M_2=0}$ or
${M_1=0,M_2\geq 1}$, respectively. In this work, we focus on the single-server
setting of the PIR-RSSI problem. We characterize the capacity of this setting
for the cases of ${M_1=1,M_2\geq 1}$ and ${M_1\geq 1,M_2=1}$, where the
capacity is defined as the maximum achievable download rate over all PIR-RSSI
schemes. Our results show that for sufficiently small values of $K$, the
single-use side information messages can help in reducing the download cost
only if they are kept private; and for larger values of $K$, the reusable side
information messages cannot help in reducing the download cost.

and environment parameters. In particular, we consider an analytical model of
three interacting qubits and derive its objectivity parameters. The numerical
analysis shows that the quality of the spectrum broadcast structure formed
during the interaction may exhibit non-monotonicity both in the speed of
self-dynamics of the environment as well as its mixedness. The former effect is
particularly strong, showing that -- considering part of the environment as a
measurement apparatus -- an increase of the external magnetic field acting on
the environment may turn the very vague measurement into close to ideal. The
above effects suggest that quantum objectivity may appear after increasing the
dynamics of the environment, although not with respect to the pointer basis,
but some other one which we call generalized pointer or indicator basis.
Furthermore, it seems also that when the objectivity is poor it may be
improved, at least by some amount, by increasing thermal noise. We provide
further evidence of that by analyzing the upper bounds on distance to the set
of states representing perfect objectivity in the case of a higher number of
qubits.

as the (linear) response to the angular momentum loss which he found to be of
${\cal O}(G^2)$ in the gravitational constant. This is a puzzle because any
amplitude calculation would produce both energy and angular momentum losses
starting only at ${\cal O}(G^3)$. Another puzzle is that the resultant
radiation reaction, of ${\cal O}(G^3)$, is nevertheless correct and confirmed
by a number of direct calculations. We ascribe these puzzles to the BMS
ambiguity in defining angular momentum. The loss of angular momentum is to be
counted out from the ADM value and, therefore, should be calculated in the
so-called canonical gauge under the BMS transformations in which the
remote-past limit of the Bondi angular momentum coincides with the ADM angular
momentum. This calculation correctly gives the ${\cal O}(G^3)$ loss. On the
other hand, we introduce a gauge in which the Bondi light cones tend
asymptotically to those emanating from the center of mass world line. We find
that the angular momentum flux in this gauge is precisely the one used by
Damour for his radiation reaction result. We call this new gauge ""intrinsic""
and argue that, although the correct angular momentum flux is to be computed in
the canonical gauge, any mechanical calculation of gauge-dependent quantities
-- such as angular momentum -- gives the result in the intrinsic gauge.
Therefore, it is this gauge that should be used in the linear response formula.
This solves the puzzles and establishes the correspondence between the
intrinsic mechanical calculations and the Bondi formalism.

reside in the bi-fundamental representation of $G$, and this is shown to be
adequate for accommodating the Standard Model (SM) fermion masses and generate,
via loop corrections and seesaw mechanism, suitable masses for the heavy
neutral leptons as well as the observed SM neutrinos. We estimate a lower bound
of around 15 TeV for the masses of the new down-type quarks that are required
by the $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R$ symmetry. We examine the resonant production at
the LHC of the new gauge bosons, which leads to a lower bound of 16 TeV for the
symmetry breaking scale of $G$. We also show how the muon $g-2$ anomaly can be
resolved in the presence of these new gauge bosons and the heavy charged

topologically stable monopole carrying three quanta $(6 \pi /e)$ of Dirac
magnetic charge and mass $\gtrsim 160$ TeV. If new matter fields lying in the

permutation $\pi \in S_n$ is selected with probability proportional to
$q^{\text{inv}(\pi)}$, where $q>0$ is a parameter and $\text{inv}(\pi)$ denotes
the number of inversions of $\pi$. For $\ell$ fixed, we study the vector
$(C_1(\Pi_n),\dots,C_\ell(\Pi_n))$ where $C_i(\pi)$ denotes the number of
cycles of length $i$ in $\pi$ and $\Pi_n$ is sampled according to the Mallows
distribution.
  Here we show that if $0<q<1$ is fixed and $n\to\infty$ then there are
positive constants $m_i$ such that each $C_i(\Pi_n)$ has mean $(1+o(1)) \cdot
m_i\cdot n$ and the vector of cycle counts can be suitably rescaled to tend to
a joint Gaussian distribution. Our results also show that when $q>1$ there is
striking difference between the behaviour of the even and the odd cycles. The
even cycle counts still have linear means, and when properly rescaled tend to a
multivariate Gaussian distribution. For the odd cycle counts on the other hand,
the limiting behaviour depends on the parity of $n$ when $q>1$. Both
$(C_1(\Pi_{2n}),C_3(\Pi_{2n}),\dots)$ and
$(C_1(\Pi_{2n+1}),C_3(\Pi_{2n+1}),\dots)$ have discrete limiting distributions
-- they do not need to be renormalized -- but the two limiting distributions
are distinct for all $q>1$. We describe these limiting distributions in terms
of Gnedin and Olshanski's bi-infinite extension of the Mallows model.
  We also investigate these limiting distributions, and study the behaviour of
the constants involved in the Gaussian limit laws. We for example show that as
$q\downarrow 1$ the expected number of 1-cycles tends to $1/2$ -- which,
curiously, differs from the value corresponding to $q=1$. In addition we
exhibit an interesting ""oscillating"" behaviour in the limiting probability
measures for $q>1$ and $n$ odd versus $n$ even.

Then, a novel packet generation process is carried out during the subsequent

number of packets transmitted to each user is the same, while the sizes of the
packets are proportional to the corresponding location-dependent cache ratios.
In this regard, each user is served with location-specific content using joint
multicast beamforming and a multi-rate modulation scheme that simultaneously
benefits from global caching and spatial multiplexing gains. Numerical
experiments and mathematical analysis demonstrate significant performance gains

two-loop diagrams are connected to each other through process-independent
operations that depend only on the Feynman rules of the model at hand. This
recursion is implemented in terms of tensor coefficients that encode the

1979, Shelah described a forcing extension of the universe in which every
autohomeomorphism of $\beta\mathbb{N}\setminus \mathbb{N}$ is the restriction
of a continuous map of $\beta\mathbb{N}$ into itself. Since there are only
$\mathfrak{c}$ such maps, the conclusion contradicts Rudin's. Rudin's result

$\beta\mathbb{N}\setminus \mathbb{N}$ correspond to automorphisms of the
Boolean algebra $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})/\text{Fin}$. This algebra is countably
saturated hence CH implies that it is fully saturated. A standard
back-and-forth argument produces a complete binary tree of height
$\aleph_1=\mathfrak{c}$ whose branches are distinct automorphisms. The fact
that the theory of atomless Boolean algebras admits elimination of quantifiers

new result of independent interest for FO-definable graph classes: negation

potential in breast cancer detection. However, the lack of domain
generalization of artificial neural networks is an important obstacle to their
deployment in changing clinical environments. In this work, we explore the
domain generalization of deep learning methods for mass detection in digital
mammography and analyze in-depth the sources of domain shift in a large-scale
multi-center setting. To this end, we compare the performance of eight
state-of-the-art detection methods, including Transformer-based models, trained
in a single domain and tested in five unseen domains. Moreover, a single-source
mass detection training pipeline is designed to improve the domain
generalization without requiring images from the new domain. The results show
that our workflow generalizes better than state-of-the-art transfer
learning-based approaches in four out of five domains while reducing the domain
shift caused by the different acquisition protocols and scanner manufacturers.
Subsequently, an extensive analysis is performed to identify the covariate
shifts with bigger effects on the detection performance, such as due to
differences in patient age, breast density, mass size, and mass malignancy.
Ultimately, this comprehensive study provides key insights and best practices
for future research on domain generalization in deep learning-based breast
cancer detection.

sense to consider working with it in the first place.
  For this particular academic endeavor, we cover several advanced topics in
set theory, including concepts like Hausdorff gaps, forcing, infinitary

on Rothberger's theorem to show that the Open Coloring Axiom implies the
equality $\mathfrak b=\aleph_1$, which in turn makes this axiom inconsistent
with CH. In other words, in ZFC, the Open Coloring Axiom could be false. To
prove its relative consistency, we show that the axiom could be true by

cosmic rays with the solar medium. The detection of SA$\nu$s would provide
useful information on the composition of primary cosmic rays as well as the
solar density. These neutrinos represent an irreducible source of background
for indirect searches for dark matter towards the Sun and the measurement of
their flux would allow for a better assessment of the uncertainties related to
these searches. In this paper we report on the analysis performed, based on an
unbinned likelihood maximisation, to search for SA$\nu$s with the ANTARES
neutrino telescope. After analysing the data collected over 11 years, no
evidence for a solar atmospheric neutrino signal has been found. An upper limit
at 90\% confidence level on the flux of solar atmospheric neutrinos has been
obtained, equal to 7$\times$$10^{-11}$ [TeV$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$] at E$_\nu

oxide heat of formation without adjustable parameters is presented. Different
degrees of $d$-electron localization in oxides are treated within the DFT+$U$
approach with site-dependent, first-principles Hubbard $U$-parameters obtained
from linear response theory, and delocalized states in the metallic phases are
treated without Hubbard corrections. Comparison of relative stabilities of
these differently treated phases is enabled by a local $d$-electron density
matrix-dependent model, which was found by genetic programming against
experimental reference formation enthalpies. This mathematically simple model
does not explicitly depend on the Hubbard-corrected ionic species and is shown
to reproduce the heats of formation of the Mott insulators Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ and
Y$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ within $\sim$3% of experimental results, where the
experimental training data did not contain Ru oxides. This newly developed
method thus absolves from the need for element-specific corrections fitted to
experiments in existing Hubbard-corrected approaches to the prediction of
reaction energies of transition metal oxides and metals. The absence of fitting
parameters opens up here the possibility to predict relative thermodynamic
stabilities and reaction energies involving $d$-states of varying degree of
localization at transition metal oxide interfaces and defects, where
site-dependent $U$-parameters will be particularly important and devising a
fitting scheme against experimental data with predictive power would be
exceedingly difficult.

quantum system in time. While Markovian dynamics can be learned easily, given a
sufficient amount of data, non-Markovian systems are non-trivial and their
description requires the memory knowledge of past states. Here we analyse the
feature of such memory by taking a simple 1D Heisenberg model as many-body
Hamiltonian, and construct a non-Markovian description by representing the
system over the single-particle reduced density matrix. The number of past
states required for this representation to reproduce the time-dependent
dynamics is found to grow exponentially with the number of spins and with the
density of the system spectrum. Most importantly, we demonstrate that neural
networks can work as time propagators at any time in the future and that they
can be concatenated in time forming an autoregression. Such neural-network
autoregression can be used to generate long-time and arbitrary dense time
trajectories. Finally, we investigate the time resolution needed to represent
the system memory. We find two regimes: for fine memory samplings the memory
needed remains constant, while longer memories are required for coarse
samplings, although the total number of time steps remains constant. The
boundary between these two regimes is set by the period corresponding to the
highest frequency in the system spectrum, demonstrating that neural network can
overcome the limitation set by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.

Alternative training schemes have been introduced, including sign symmetry,

the rate region, which serves as both necessary and sufficient conditions to
have secure transmission even under side-channel attacks. Furthermore, we also
prove another theoretical result on our new security criterion, which might be
interesting in its own right: in the case of the discrete memoryless source, no
perfect secrecy under side-channel attacks in the standard security criterion,
i.e., the ordinary mutual information, is achievable without achieving perfect
secrecy in this new security criterion, although our new security criterion is
more strict than the standard security criterion.

practical use across many domains including safety-critical applications like
autonomous driving and medical diagnostics. Despite their widespread use, image

bringing their robustness into question. There is an urgent need for methods
that systematically characterise and quantify the capabilities of these models

robustness. In this paper, we propose Vision Checklist, a framework aimed at
interrogating the capabilities of a model in order to produce a report that can
be used by a system designer for robustness evaluations. This framework
proposes a set of perturbation operations that can be applied on the underlying
data to generate test samples of different types. The perturbations reflect
potential changes in operating environments, and interrogate various properties
ranging from the strictly quantitative to more qualitative. Our framework is
evaluated on multiple datasets like Tinyimagenet, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and
Camelyon17 and for models like ViT and Resnet. Our Vision Checklist proposes a
specific set of evaluations that can be integrated into the previously proposed
concept of a model card. Robustness evaluations like our checklist will be
crucial in future safety evaluations of visual perception modules, and be
useful for a wide range of stakeholders including designers, deployers, and
regulators involved in the certification of these systems. Source code of

BCl$_{3}$ adsorbates, identifying several surface configurations and tracking
the change in their distribution as a function of the annealing temperature,
matching predictions of the kinetic model well. This straightforward pathway

the discrete method approximates a Bubnov$-$Galerkin method in a suitable

optimal convergence rates and sufficient rates of oversampling are preserved in
the more general case. Indeed, for the first time, this analysis provides a

Ginzburg-Landau theory to investigate the vortex dynamics in superconductors of
mesoscopic dimensions with a large central square defect with three different
configurations: (i) a hole which passes through the sample (interface with the
vacuum); (ii) a superconducting region with lower critical temperature (Tc);
and (iii) a region with a more robust superconductivity, i.e., with a higherTc.
Such systems can be envisaged as elementary building blocks of a macroscopic
decorated specimen. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of different
interfaces on the vortex dynamics and their effects in the field-dependent
magnetization and time-dependent induced electric potential variation. The
results show that the lower critical field is independent from the nature of
the defect. However, the currents crowd at the vertices of the through hole
producing a lower degradation of the local superconductivity, which may
increase the upper critical field. On the other hand, the last type of defect
can be used to control the vortex dynamics in the main superconducting region
around the defect with more accuracy. Whereas the first two defects are
attractive for the vortices, the third type is repulsive for them, being needed
several vortices penetrated in the superconducting matrix to have vortices
penetrated into it.

encoders are highly vulnerable to model stealing attacks. However, most of the
current efforts of copyright protection algorithms such as watermarking
concentrate on classifiers. Meanwhile, the intrinsic challenges of pre-trained
encoder's copyright protection remain largely unstudied. We fill the gap by
proposing SSLGuard, the first watermarking scheme for pre-trained encoders.
Given a clean pre-trained encoder, SSLGuard injects a watermark into it and
outputs a watermarked version. The shadow training technique is also applied to
preserve the watermark under potential model stealing attacks. Our extensive
evaluation shows that SSLGuard is effective in watermark injection and
verification, and it is robust against model stealing and other watermark
removal attacks such as input noising, output perturbing, overwriting, model
pruning, and fine-tuning.

an exposure and an outcome. While existing mediation analytic approaches are
capable of providing insight into complex processes, they mainly focus on a
univariate mediator or mediator vector, without considering network-variate
mediators. To fill the methodological gap and accomplish this exciting and
urgent application, in the paper, we propose an integrative mediation analysis
under a Bayesian paradigm with networks entailing the mediation effect. To
parameterize the network measurements, we introduce individually specified
stochastic block models with unknown block allocation, and naturally bridge
effect elements through the latent network mediators induced by the
connectivity weights across network modules. To enable the identification of
truly active mediating components, we simultaneously impose a feature selection
across network mediators. We show the superiority of our model in estimating
different effect components and selecting active mediating network structures.
As a practical illustration of this approach's application to network
neuroscience, we characterize the relationship between a therapeutic

between theory and observation of the apsidal precession rate, which was
resolved when both stars were found to be severely misaligned with the orbit.
We used data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to refine
our knowledge of the stellar obliquities and sharpen the comparison between the
observed and theoretical precession rates. The TESS data show variations with a
1.07-day period, which we interpret as rotational modulation from starspots on
the primary star. This interpretation is supported by the detection of
photometric anomalies during primary eclipses consistent with starspot
crossings. The secondary eclipse light curve shows a repeatable asymmetry which
we interpret as an effect of gravity darkening. By combining the TESS data with
previously obtained data, we determined the three-dimensional spin directions
of both stars. Using this information, the updated value of the theoretical
apsidal precession rate (including the effects of tides, rotation, and general
relativity) is $1.35^{+0.58}_{-0.50}$ arcsec/cycle. The updated value of the
observed rate (after including new TESS eclipse times) is
$1.41^{+0.39}_{-0.28}$ arcsec/cycle. Given the agreement between the observed

evolution that differs substantially depending on their magnetic fields or past
accretion history. The recent detection of several slowly rotating pulsars has
re-opened the long-standing question of the exact physics, and observational
biases, driving the upper bound of the period range of the pulsar population.
In this work, we perform a parameter study of the spin-period evolution of
pulsars interacting with supernova fallback matter and specifically look at the
fallback accretion disk scenario. Depending on the initial conditions at
formation, this evolution can differ substantially from the typical dipolar
spin-down, resulting in pulsars that show spin periods longer than their coeval
peers. By using general assumptions for the pulsar spin period and magnetic
field at birth, initial fallback accretion rates and including magnetic field
decay, we find that very long spin periods (>100s) can be reached in the
presence of strong, magnetar-like magnetic fields (>10^{14}G) and moderate
initial fallback accretion rates (~10^{22-27} g s^{-1}). In addition, we study
the cases of two recently discovered periodic radio sources, the pulsar PSR

which a GNN predicts a score for a verifier that indicates its performance on
the program.
  We evaluate Graves on a set of 10 verification tools and over 8000
verification problems and find that it improves the state-of-the-art in
verification algorithm selection by 11\%. We conjecture this is in part due to
Graves' use of GNNs with attention mechanisms. Through a qualitative study on
model interpretability, we find strong evidence that the Graves' GNN-based
model learns to base its predictions on factors that relate to the unique
features of the algorithmic techniques.

hydrocarbon (PAH) emission properties in the (circum)nuclear region (NR) and
extranuclear regions (ENRs) of M51a using Spitzer-IRS observations.
Correlations among PAH intensity ratios are examined with respect to each
other, local physical parameters, galactocentric distance ($R_{g}$), and very
small grain (VSG) emission. Additional comparison is performed with the
mid-infrared emission features in the H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions of M33 and M83.
The NR exhibits the strongest correlation among the PAH intensity ratios,
whereas ENRs are showing increased scatter attributed to ISM emission. Overall,
the radiation field hardness has a higher impact on PAH emission than
metallicity, with the latter regulating PAH variance as a function of $R_{g}$.
Specifically, the variance of PAH emission with respect to the different
physical parameters suggests a higher rate of small/medium PAH processing
compared to large PAHs and a higher ratio of small-to-large PAHs formed with
increasing galactocentric distance. We find similarities between the 7.7 $\mu$m
carriers in M51a's NR and M83's H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions, the 8.6 $\mu$m
carriers in M51a's NR and M33 H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions, and both types of
carriers between M51a's ENRs, M33's, and M83's H$_{\mathrm{II}}$ regions. We
have identified a positive correlation between PAH/VSG and the PAH intensity
ratios. We conclude that the relative abundance of PAHs and VSG is not solely
driven by the hardness of the radiation field.

for the $\bar{Q}Q\bar{Q}Q$ system, because they not only give significant

platform more distinct, especially for the $\bar{b}b\bar{b}b$ in the

convergence in our phenomenological analysis.

required repetition rate could be lowered by having a flat band (with a slow

Transport and thermodynamic measurements on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ show
signatures of a quantum critical point, including a peak in the electronic
specific heat $C$ versus doping p, near the doping p*, where the pseudogap
collapses. The fundamental nature of the fluctuations associated with this peak
is unclear. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to show that close to
$T_c$ and near p*, there are low-energy collective spin excitations with
characteristic energies $\approx$ 5 meV. The correlation length of the spin
fluctuations does not diverge in spite of the low energy scale and we conclude
that the underlying quantum criticality is not due to antiferromagnetism but
most likely to a collapse of the pseudogap. We show that the large specific
heat near p* can be understood in terms of collective spin fluctuations. The
spin fluctuations we measure exist across the superconducting phase diagram and
may be related to the strange metal behaviour observed in overdoped cuprates.

they involve only (multiple rounds of) simplicial shifting between upper and

Hodge-decomposition to delineate gradient, curl and harmonic frequencies. We
discuss how these frequencies correspond to the lower- and the upper-adjacent

designing simplicial convolutional filters and discuss their relative
advantages. Finally, we corroborate our simplicial filters in several

to denoise edge flows, and to analyze financial markets and traffic networks.

informed priors. Using existing HzQ data in the literature, we set a posterior
threshold that accepts ${\sim}90\%$ of known HzQs while rejecting $>99\%$ of

probability selection on test samples of simulated HzQs and contaminants, we
find that the efficacy of the probability method is higher than traditional
colour cuts, decreasing the fraction of accepted contaminants by 86% while
retaining a similar fraction of HzQs. As a test, we apply our method to the
Pan-STARRS Data Release 1 (PS1) source catalogue within the HETDEX Spring field
area on the sky, covering 400 sq. deg. and coinciding with deep radio data from
the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 1 (LoTSS DR1). From an initial
sample of ${\sim}5\times10^5$ sources in PS1, our selection shortlists 251
candidate HzQs, which are further reduced to 63 after visual inspection.
Shallow spectroscopic follow-up of 13 high probability HzQs resulted in the
confirmation of a previously undiscovered quasar at $z=5.66$ with photometric
colours $i-z = 1.4$, lying outside the typically probed regions when selecting
HzQs based on colours. This discovery demonstrates the efficacy of our
probabilistic HzQ selection method in selecting more complete HzQ samples,
which holds promise when employed on large existing and upcoming photometric

prominent focus was given to matrix and tensor factorizations, which correspond
to simplified neural networks. It was shown that these models exhibit an
implicit tendency towards low matrix and tensor ranks, respectively. Drawing
closer to practical deep learning, the current paper theoretically analyzes the
implicit regularization in hierarchical tensor factorization, a model
equivalent to certain deep convolutional neural networks. Through a dynamical
systems lens, we overcome challenges associated with hierarchy, and establish
implicit regularization towards low hierarchical tensor rank. This translates
to an implicit regularization towards locality for the associated convolutional
networks. Inspired by our theory, we design explicit regularization
discouraging locality, and demonstrate its ability to improve the performance
of modern convolutional networks on non-local tasks, in defiance of
conventional wisdom by which architectural changes are needed. Our work
highlights the potential of enhancing neural networks via theoretical analysis

with additional superclass labels and noisy similarity scores. Furthermore, we
show that RINCE can also be applied to unsupervised training with experiments

better in out-of-distribution detection than the standard InfoNCE loss.

constrain the lifetime of particle dark matter (DM). We consider two-body
decaying dark matter (DDM) in which a heavy DM particle decays with lifetime
$\tau$ comparable to the age of the Universe to a lighter DM particle (with
mass splitting $\epsilon$) and to a dark radiation species. These decays impart
a characteristic ""kick velocity,"" $V_{\mathrm{kick}}=\epsilon c$, on the DM
daughter particles, significantly depleting the DM content of low-mass subhalos
and making them more susceptible to tidal disruption. We fit the suppression of
the present-day DDM subhalo mass function (SHMF) as a function of $\tau$ and
$V_{\mathrm{kick}}$ using a suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of
MW-mass halos, and we validate this model on new DDM simulations of systems
specifically chosen to resemble the MW. We implement our DDM SHMF predictions
in a forward model that incorporates inhomogeneities in the spatial
distribution and detectability of MW satellites and uncertainties in the
mapping between galaxies and DM halos, the properties of the MW system, and the
disruption of subhalos by the MW disk using an empirical model for the
galaxy--halo connection. By comparing to the observed MW satellite population,
we conservatively exclude DDM models with $\tau < 18\ \mathrm{Gyr}$ ($29\
\mathrm{Gyr}$) for $V_{\mathrm{kick}}=20\ \mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($40\
\mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$) at $95\%$ confidence. These constraints are
among the most stringent and robust small-scale structure limits on the DM
particle lifetime and strongly disfavor DDM models that have been proposed to
alleviate the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions.

reach the turnover of the GC luminosity function and (ii) provide a sufficient

the relation between $N_{\rm GC}$ and $M_{\rm total}$. This value of $N_{\rm

luminosity function, radial profile and average colour are more consistent with
those observed for dwarf galaxies than with those observed for the more massive

the nature of which remains unclear. Based on their discovery in active
galactic nuclei (AGN), explanations related to an AGN accretion disk, or
potentially stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), were put forward. Following
the report of QPEs in apparently passive galaxies, alternatives including
highly unequal mass compact object binaries have been proposed to explain their
properties. We perform a systematic study of the five known QPE host galaxies
with the aim of providing new insights into their nature. We analyse new and
archival medium resolution optical spectroscopy of the QPE hosts. We measure
emission (and absorption) line fluxes, their ratios and equivalent widths
(EWs), to locate the QPE hosts on diagnostic diagrams. We also measure the
velocity dispersion of the stellar absorption lines to estimate their black
hole masses. All QPE host galaxies show emission lines in their optical
spectra. Based on their ratios and EWs, we find evidence for the presence of an
active galactic nucleus in all sources, including those previously reported as
passive. We measure velocity dispersions between 36 and 90 km/s, implying the
presence of low mass (10^5-6.7 solar masses) black holes, consistent with
literature findings. Finally, we find a significant over-representation (2/5
sources, or a factor of 13 +13 -10.5) of quiescent, Balmer strong (post
starburst) galaxies among QPE hosts. The presence of a narrow line region
consistent with an AGN in all QPE host galaxies implies that a pre-existing
accretion flow likely plays an integral part to the QPE phenomenon. The strong
over-representation of quiescent Balmer strong galaxies among QPE hosts can be
naturally explained in both the TDE and interacting extreme mass ratio inspiral
hypotheses.

alternative theories because their dynamical mass (from observed kinematics)
largely outweighs their baryonic mass (from gas and stars). In most
star-forming dwarfs, cold atomic gas forms regularly rotating disks extending
beyond the stellar component, thus probing the gravitational potential out to
the outermost regions. Here I review several aspects of gas dynamics in dwarf
galaxies, such as rotation curves, mass models, and noncircular motions.
Star-forming dwarfs extend the dynamical laws of spiral galaxies to lower
masses, surface densities, and accelerations. The three main dynamical laws of
rotation-supported galaxies point to three distinct acceleration scales, which
play different physical roles but display the same value, within uncertainties.
The small scatter around these dynamical laws implies a tight coupling between
baryons and dark matter in galaxies, which will be better understood with
next-generation surveys that will enlarge current sample sizes by orders of
magnitude.

by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. If the medium is magnetized, then the
black hole can produce relativistic outflows. We performed the first 3D,
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of BHL accretion onto
rapidly rotating black holes using the code H-AMR, where we mainly varied the
strength of a background magnetic field that threads the medium. We found that
the ensuing accretion continuously drags to the BH the magnetic flux, which
accumulates near the event horizon until it becomes dynamically important.
Depending on the strength of the background magnetic field, the BHs can
sometimes launch relativistic jets with high enough power to drill out of the
inner accretion flow, become bent by the headwind, and escape to large
distances. While for stronger background magnetic fields the jets are
continuously powered, at weaker field strengths they are intermittent, turning
on and off depending on the fluctuating gas and magnetic flux distributions
near the event horizon. We find that our jets reach extremely high efficiencies
of $\sim100-300\%$, even in the absence of an accretion disk. We also
calculated the drag forces exerted by the gas onto to the BH, finding that the
presence of magnetic fields causes drag forces to be much less efficient than
in unmagnetized BHL accretion, and sometimes become negative, accelerating the
BH rather than slowing it down. Our results extend classical BHL accretion to
rotating BHs moving through magnetized media and demonstrate that accretion and
drag are significantly altered in this environment.

powering quasars at high redshift grow to supermassive scales within a billion
years of the Big Bang. Here we show that sustained super-Eddington accretion
can be achieved for BHs with Eddington fractions $f_{\rm Edd}$ > 2/$\epsilon$,
where $\epsilon$ is the efficiency with which radiation is generated in the
accretion process. In this regime, the radiation carries too little momentum to
halt the accretion flow and the infalling gas traps the radiation. The BH
growth then proceeds unimpeded until the gas supply is exhausted, in contrast
to accretion at lower rates which is limited by the radiation generated in the
accretion process. The large gas supply available in massive high-redshift
quasar host galaxies may be readily accreted onto seed BHs via this
supply-limited mode of accretion, providing an explanation for how such
supermassive BHs are assembled in the early universe. This sustained
super-Eddington growth may also explain the short lifetimes inferred for the H
II regions surrounding high-redshift quasars, if the bulk of the BH growth
occurs without the associated radiation escaping to ionize the intergalactic
medium. It furthermore implies that a population of obscured rapidly growing
BHs may be difficult to detect, perhaps explaining why so few quasars with
Eddington fractions higher than a few have been observed. Finally, this simple
condition for sustained super-Eddington growth can easily be implemented in
cosmological simulations which can be used to assess in which environments it
occurs.

the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has introduced the Device Identifier
Composition Engine (DICE) series of specifications. DICE is a hardware-software
architecture for constrained, e.g., microcontroller-based IoT devices where the
firmware is divided into successively executed layers.
  In this paper, we demonstrate a remote Time-Of-Check Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU)
attack on DICE-based attestation. We demonstrate that it is possible to install
persistent malware in the flash memory of a constrained microcontroller that
cannot be detected through DICE-based attestation. The main idea of our attack
is to install malware during runtime of application logic in the top firmware
layer. The malware reads the valid attestation key and stores it on the
device's flash memory. After reboot, the malware uses the previously stored key
for all subsequent attestations to the backend. We conduct the installation of
malware and copying of the key through Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). As a
platform for our demonstration, we use the Cortex-M-based nRF52840

We account for the reflection spectrum with two independent models (relxillns

estimates from optical observations of ellipsoidal light curve modeling
(relxillns: $i=67^{\circ}\pm4^{\circ}$, rdblur*rfxconv:

have seen a significant growth of their user base in recent years. This
popularity is mainly attributed to the stricter moderation enforced by
mainstream platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. In this work we
provide the first large scale analysis of hate-speech on Parler.
  We experiment with an array of algorithms for hate-speech detection,
demonstrating limitations of transfer learning in that domain, given the
illusive and ever changing nature of the ways hate-speech is delivered. In
order to improve classification accuracy we annotated 10K Parler posts, which
we use to fine-tune a BERT classifier. Classification of individual posts is
then leveraged for the classification of millions of users via label
propagation over the social network. Classifying users by their propensity to
disseminate hate, we find that hate mongers make 16.1\% of Parler active users,
and that they have distinct characteristics comparing to other user groups. We
find that hate mongers are more active, more central and express distinct
levels of sentiment and convey a distinct array of emotions like anger and
sadness. We further complement our analysis by comparing the trends discovered
in Parler and those found in Gab.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first works to analyze hate
speech in Parler in a quantitative manner and on the user level, and the first
annotated dataset to be made available to the community.

Quantum (NISQ) devices, are characterized by relatively low number of qubits

error correction is impossible and the performance of those devices is quite
modest. In particular, the depth of circuits implementable with reasonably high
fidelity is limited, and the minimization of circuit depth is required. Such
depths depend on the efficiency of the universal set of gates $\mathcal{S}$
used in computation, and can be bounded using the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.
However, it is known that much better, asymptotically tight bounds of the form
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{log}(\epsilon^{-1}))$, can be obtained for specific
$\mathcal{S}$. Those bounds are controlled by so called spectral gap, denoted
$\mathrm{gap}(\mathcal{S})$. Yet, the computation of
$\mathrm{gap}(\mathcal{S})$ is not possible for general $\mathcal{S}$ and in
practice one considers spectral gap at a certain scale $r(\epsilon)$, denoted
$\mathrm{gap}_r(\mathcal{S})$. This turns out to be sufficient to bound the
efficiency of $\mathcal{S}$ provided that one is interested in a physically
feasible case, in which an error $\epsilon$ is bounded from below. In this
paper we derive lower bounds on $\mathrm{gap}_r(\mathcal{S})$ and, as a
consequence, on the efficiency of universal sets of $d$-dimensional quantum

naturally met for generic quantum gates, such as e.g. Haar random gates. Our

computer simulations like Molecular Dynamics (MD) enable us to investigate
these thermally activated processes with an atomic level of resolution.
However, rare conformational transitions are intrinsically hard to investigate
with MD, because an exponentially large fraction of computational resources
must be invested to simulate thermal fluctuations in metastable states. Path
sampling methods like Transition Path Sampling hold the great promise of
focusing the available computational power on sampling the rare stochastic
transition between metastable states. In these approaches, one of the
outstanding limitations is to generate paths that visit significantly different
regions of the conformational space at a low computational cost. To overcome
these problems we introduce a rigorous approach that integrates a machine
learning algorithm and MD simulations implemented on a classical computer with
adiabatic quantum computing. First, using functional integral methods, we
derive a rigorous low-resolution representation of the system's dynamics, based
on a small set of molecular configurations generated with machine learning.
Then, a quantum annealing machine is employed to explore the transition path
ensemble of this low-resolution theory, without introducing un-physical biasing
forces to steer the system's dynamics. Using the D-Wave quantum computer, we
validate our scheme by simulating a benchmark conformational transition in a
state-of-the-art atomistic description. We show that the quantum computing step
generates uncorrelated trajectories, thus facilitating the sampling of the
transition region in configuration space. Our results provide a new paradigm
for MD simulations to integrate machine learning and quantum computing.

efficiently controlling quantum many-body systems based on reinforcement

applied to prepare ground states of the quantum Ising chain, including states
in the critical region. It allows us to control systems far larger than

deep learning algorithms, such as generalizability and trainable robustness to

universal controls, of learning how to optimally steer previously unseen
many-body states, and of adapting control protocols on-the-fly when the quantum
dynamics is subject to stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we map the QMPS

noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and test it under the presence of
experimentally relevant sources of noise.

synchrotron radiation of accelerated relativistic electrons in the shock

unpredictable errors. Transfer learning is the area of machine learning that
tries to prevent these errors. Especially, approaches that augment image data
using auxiliary knowledge encoded in language embeddings or knowledge graphs
(KGs) have achieved promising results in recent years. This survey focuses on
visual transfer learning approaches using KGs. KGs can represent auxiliary
knowledge either in an underlying graph-structured schema or in a vector-based
knowledge graph embedding. Intending to enable the reader to solve visual
transfer learning problems with the help of specific KG-DL configurations we
start with a description of relevant modeling structures of a KG of various
expressions, such as directed labeled graphs, hypergraphs, and hyper-relational
graphs. We explain the notion of feature extractor, while specifically
referring to visual and semantic features. We provide a broad overview of
knowledge graph embedding methods and describe several joint training
objectives suitable to combine them with high dimensional visual embeddings.

combined with a DL pipeline: 1) Knowledge Graph as a Reviewer; 2) Knowledge
Graph as a Trainee; 3) Knowledge Graph as a Trainer; and 4) Knowledge Graph as

world is more populous and connected than ever before, and therefore, the rate
of contagion for such diseases often becomes stupendous. The development and
distribution of testing kits cannot keep up with the demand, making it
impossible to test everyone. The next best option is to identify and isolate
the people who come in close contact with an infected person. However, this
apparently simple process, commonly known as - contact tracing, suffers from
two major pitfalls: the requirement of a large amount of manpower to track the
infected individuals manually and the breach in privacy and security while
automating the process. Here, we propose a Bluetooth based contact tracing
hardware with anonymous IDs to solve both the drawbacks of the existing
approaches. The hardware will be a wearable device that every user can carry
conveniently. This device will measure the distance between two users and
exchange the IDs anonymously in the case of a close encounter. The anonymous
IDs stored in the device of any newly infected individual will be used to trace
the risky contacts and the status of the IDs will be updated consequently by
authorized personnel. To demonstrate the concept, we simulate the working
procedure and highlight the effectiveness of our technique to curb the spread

heterogeneous plastic instabilities with localized cooperative rearrangement of
cluster of particles. The heterogeneous behavior plays an important role in
deciding the mechanical properties of amorphous solids. In this paper, we
employ computer simulation to study the characteristics and the spatial
correlations of these clusters characterized by the non-affine displacements in
amorphous solids under simple shear deformation in the athermal quasistatic
limit. The clusters with large displacements are found to be homogeneously
distributed in space in the elastic regime, followed by a localization within a
system-spanning shear band after yielding. The distributions of the
displacement field exhibit power-law nature with exponents strongly dependent
on the deformation. The non-affine displacements show strong spatial
correlations which become long-ranged with increasing strain. From our results,
it is evident that the decay of the correlation functions is exponential in
nature in the elastic regime. The yielding transition is marked by an abrupt
change in the decay after which it is well described by power-law. These
results demonstrate a scale-free character of non-affine correlations in the
stead flow regime. These results are found to be robust and independent of the
strain window over which the total non-affine displacement is calculated.

ionizing radiation. We first constrain the massive star content (ages and
metallicities) and UV attenuation, by fitting the stellar continuum with a
combination of simple stellar population models. The models, together with
accurate LyC flux measurements, allow to determine the absolute LyC photon
escape fraction for each galaxy ($f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$). We measure the
equivalent widths and residual fluxes of multiple HI and low-ionization state
(LIS) lines, and the geometrical covering fraction adopting the picket-fence
model. The $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$ spans a wide range, with a median (0.16,
0.84 quantiles) of 0.04 (0.02, 0.20), and 50 out of the 89 galaxies detected in
the LyC. The HI and LIS line equivalent widths scale with the UV luminosity and
attenuation, and inversely with the residual flux of the lines. The HI and LIS
residual fluxes are correlated, indicating that the neutral gas is spatially
traced by the LIS transitions. We find the observed trends of the absorption
lines and the UV attenuation are primarily driven by the covering fraction. The
non-uniform gas coverage demonstrates that LyC photons escape through
low-column density channels in the ISM. The equivalent widths and residual
fluxes of the UV lines strongly correlate with $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm abs}$: strong
LyC leakers show weak absorption lines, low UV attenuation, and large
Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths. We finally show that simultaneous UV absorption
line and dust attenuation measurements can predict, on average, the escape
fraction of galaxies and the method can be applied to galaxies across a wide

consists of two point masses moving inside a flat three-dimensional brane,
embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski space and interacting only through a
massless scalar field localized on the same brane, while gravitational
radiation is emitted into the bulk. This setup avoids the difficulties
associated with taking into account the gravitational stresses binding the
system, which require the cubic terms in the perturbative gravitational
Lagrangian, and permits to limit ourselves to linearized theory. We calculate
radiation in a linearized five-dimensional gravity generalizing the

point particles and a non-local contribution from scalar field stresses, which

dedicated to instrument beam and gain calibration, including stabilized signal
injection into the interferometric array and drone-based platforms for beam

broad-band incoherent sources that can only be detected as excess power and
with no direct sensitivity to phase information. In this paper, we describe a
digital radio source which uses Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) derived time
stamps to form a deterministic signal that can be broadcast from an aerial
platform. A copy of this source can be deployed locally at the instrument
correlator such that the received signal from the aerial platform can be
correlated with the local copy, and the resulting correlation can be measured
in both amplitude and phase for each interferometric element. We define the
requirements for such a source, describe an initial implementation and
verification of this source using commercial Software Defined Radio boards, and
present beam map slices from antenna range measurements using the commercial
boards. We found that the commercial board did not meet all requirements, so we
also suggest future directions using a more sophisticated chipset.

point out how to construct such a portfolio for specific domains. The
improvement in the optimization is possible due to more efficient transfer of

models. Assessing their accuracy is a complex task and there are multiple
observational pathways to provide constraints and tune model parameters. Here,
we combine several such independent constraints, defining a model-agnostic
framework for standardized comparison. We require models to predict the
distribution of coronal holes at the photosphere, and neutral line topology at
the model outer boundary. We compare these predictions to extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) observations of coronal hole locations, white-light Carrington maps of
the streamer belt and the magnetic sector structure measured \textit{in situ}
by Parker Solar Probe and 1AU spacecraft. We study these metrics for Potential
Field Source Surface (PFSS) models as a function of source surface height and
magnetogram choice, as well as comparing to the more physical Wang-Sheeley-Arge
(WSA) and the Magnetohydrodynamics Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) models. We
find that simultaneous optimization of PFSS models to all three metrics is not
currently possible, implying a trade-off between the quality of representation
of coronal holes and streamer belt topology. WSA and MAS results show the
additional physics they include addresses this by flattening the streamer belt
while maintaining coronal hole sizes, with MAS also improving coronal hole
representation relative to WSA. We conclude that this framework is highly
useful for inter- and intra-model comparisons. Integral to the framework is the
standardization of observables required of each model, evaluating different
model aspects.

  Processing correct inferences is especially challenging when (confounding)
factors are not controlled experimentally (observational evidence). For this
reason, robots that rely on inferences that are correlational risk a biased
interpretation of the evidence.
  We propose equipping robots with the necessary tools to conduct observational
studies on people. Specifically, we propose and explore the feasibility of
structural causal models with non-parametric estimators to derive empirical
estimates on hand behavior in the context of object manipulation in a virtual
kitchen scenario. In particular, we focus on inferences under (the weaker)
conditions of partial confounding (the model covering only some factors) and
confront estimators with hundreds of samples instead of the typical order of
thousands. Studying these conditions explores the boundaries of the approach
and its viability.
  Despite the challenging conditions, the estimates inferred from the
validation data are correct. Moreover, these estimates are stable against three
refutation strategies where four estimators are in agreement. Furthermore, the
causal quantity for two individuals reveals the sensibility of the approach to
detect positive and negative effects.

evaluate the accountability of the suppliers. Two case studies are used to
illustrate accountability measures for scenarios with single and multiple

the optoelectronic industry. In principle, there are two options. For many

even if the integration is complex and therefore costly. However, where low
costs and also high integration density are crucial, group-IV-based lasers -
made of Ge and GeSn, for example - could be an alternative, provided their
performance can be improved. Such progresses will come with better materials
but also with the development of a profounder understanding of their optical

to 6.6%, a powerful method for determining the population inversion gain and
the material and optical losses of group IV lasers. This is made by deriving
the values for the injection carrier densities and the cavity losses from the
measurement of the change of the refractive index and the mode linewidth,
respectively. We observe a laser threshold consistent with optical gain and
material loss values obtained from a tight binding calculation. Lasing in Ge -
at steady-state - is found to be limited to low temperatures in a narrow regime
of tensile strain at the crossover to the direct band gap bandstructure. We
explain this observation by parasitic intervalence band absorption that
increases rapidly with higher injection densities and temperature. N-doping
seems to reduce the material loss at low excitation but does not extend the
lasing regime. We also discuss the impact of the optically inactive carriers in
the L-valley on the linewidth of group IV lasers.

require human analysts to make decisions on how to treat the data. These
decisions can make the model building process subjective and difficult to

benefit by allowing the model to learn what features are important once the

human decisions for traditional ML modeling would help to improve the
reproducibility and remove subjective aspects of the model building process. To
that end, we propose to use shape metrics to describe 2D data to help make
analyses more explainable and interpretable. The proposed approach provides a
foundation to help automate various aspects of model building in an
interpretable and explainable fashion. This is particularly important in
applications in the medical community where the `right to explainability' is
crucial. We provide various simulated data sets ranging from probability

more versatile to handle uncertain traffic conditions than fully automated
platooning systems. This paper presents a novel distributed stochastic model
predictive control (DSMPC) design for a human-leading heavy-duty truck platoon.
The proposed DSMPC design integrates the stochastic driver behavior model of
the human-driven leader truck with a distributed formation control design for
the following automated trucks in the platoon. The driver behavior of the
human-driven leader truck is learned by a stochastic inverse reinforcement
learning (SIRL) approach. The proposed stochastic driver behavior model aims to
learn a distribution of cost function, which represents the richness and
uniqueness of human driver behaviors, with a given set of driver-specific
demonstrations. The distributed formation control includes a serial DSMPC with
guaranteed recursive feasibility, closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction,
and string stability. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the
efficacy of the proposed design under several realistic traffic scenarios.
Compared to the baseline platoon control strategy (deterministic distributed
model predictive control), the proposed DSMPC achieves superior controller
performance in constraint violations and spacing errors.

exploiting the network-level communication on their peer-to-peer network.
Adversaries who control a set of colluding node(s) within the peer-to-peer

involved. Thus, various network anonymity schemes have been proposed to
mitigate this problem, with some solutions providing theoretical anonymity
guarantees.
  In this work, we model such peer-to-peer network anonymity solutions and
evaluate their anonymity guarantees. To do so, we propose a novel framework
that uses Bayesian inference to obtain the probability distributions linking
transactions to their possible originators. We characterize transaction
anonymity with those distributions, using entropy as metric of adversarial
uncertainty on the originator's identity. In particular, we model Dandelion,
Dandelion++ and Lightning Network. We study different configurations and
demonstrate that none of them offers acceptable anonymity to their users. For
instance, our analysis reveals that in the widely deployed Lightning Network,
with 1% strategically chosen colluding nodes the adversary can uniquely
determine the originator for about 50% of the total transactions in the
network. In Dandelion, an adversary that controls 15% of the nodes has on
average uncertainty among only 8 possible originators. Moreover, we observe
that due to the way Dandelion and Dandelion++ are designed, increasing the
network size does not correspond to an increase in the anonymity set of
potential originators. Alarmingly, our longitudinal analysis of Lightning
Network reveals rather an inverse trend -- with the growth of the network the
overall anonymity decreases.

traditional image classification tasks because histopathology images naturally
exhibit a range of diagnostic features, resulting in a diverse range of
annotator agreement levels. However, examples with high annotator disagreement
are often either assigned the majority label or discarded entirely when
training histopathology image classifiers. This widespread practice often
yields classifiers that do not account for example difficulty and exhibit poor
model calibration. In this paper, we ask: can we improve model calibration by
endowing histopathology image classifiers with inductive biases about example
difficulty?
  We propose several label smoothing methods that utilize per-image annotator
agreement. Though our methods are simple, we find that they substantially
improve model calibration, while maintaining (or even improving) accuracy. For
colorectal polyp classification, a common yet challenging task in
gastrointestinal pathology, we find that our proposed agreement-aware label
smoothing methods reduce calibration error by almost 70%. Moreover, we find
that using model confidence as a proxy for annotator agreement also improves
calibration and accuracy, suggesting that datasets without multiple annotators
can still benefit from our proposed label smoothing methods via our proposed
confidence-aware label smoothing methods.
  Given the importance of calibration (especially in histopathology image
analysis), the improvements from our proposed techniques merit further
exploration and potential implementation in other histopathology image
classification tasks.

including a smooth, clumpy and two phase torus models, and a clumpy disk plus
wind model. Although, the smooth torus model describe the spectra of NGC1068 if
we allow to vary some model parameters among the two spectral bands. Motivated
by this result, we produced new SEDs using the radiative transfer code SKIRT.
We use two concentric tori that allow us to test a more complex geometry. We
test different values for the inner and outer radii, half opening angle, radial
and polar exponent of the power-law density profile, opacity, and viewing
angle. Furthermore, we also test the dust grains size and different optical and
calorimetric properties of silicate grains. The best fitting model consists of
two concentric components with outer radii of 1.8 and 28 pc, respectively. We
find that the size and the optical and calorimetric properties of graphite and
silicate grains in the dust structure are key to reproduce the spectra of

the highest contribution to the mid-infrared is given by a central and compact
component. A less dense and extended component is present, which can be either

(DAEs) has recently emerged as a promising new approach for optimizing
challenging black-box functions over structured, discrete, hard-to-enumerate
search spaces (e.g., molecules). Here the DAE dramatically simplifies the
search space by mapping inputs into a continuous latent space where familiar
Bayesian optimization tools can be more readily applied. Despite this
simplification, the latent space typically remains high-dimensional. Thus, even
with a well-suited latent space, these approaches do not necessarily provide a
complete solution, but may rather shift the structured optimization problem to
a high-dimensional one. In this paper, we propose LOL-BO, which adapts the
notion of trust regions explored in recent work on high-dimensional Bayesian
optimization to the structured setting. By reformulating the encoder to
function as both an encoder for the DAE globally and as a deep kernel for the
surrogate model within a trust region, we better align the notion of local
optimization in the latent space with local optimization in the input space.
LOL-BO achieves as much as 20 times improvement over state-of-the-art latent

  Eulerian fluid-structure interaction",,,"10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111903",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present an interface and geometry preserving (IGP) method for the modeling
of fully Eulerian fluid-structure interaction via phase-field formulation.
While the hyperbolic tangent interface profile is preserved by the
time-dependent mobility model, the proposed method maintains the geometry of
the solid-fluid interface by reducing the volume-conserved mean curvature flow.
To achieve the reduction in the curvature flow, we construct a
gradient-minimizing velocity field (GMV) for the convection of the order
parameter. The constructed velocity field enables the preservation of the solid
velocity in the solid domain while extending the velocity in the normal
direction throughout the diffuse interface region. With this treatment, the GMV
reduces the normal velocity difference of the level sets of the order parameter
which alleviates the undesired thickening or thinning of the diffuse interface
region due to the convection. During this process, the time-dependent mobility
coefficient is substantially reduced and there is a lesser curvature flow. The
GMV ensures that the diffuse interface region moves with the solid bulk such
that the fluid-solid interface conforms to the geometry of the solid. Using the
unified momentum equation and the phase-dependent interpolation, we integrate
the IGP method into a fully Eulerian variational FSI solver based on the
incompressible viscous fluid and the neo-Hookean solid. We first demonstrate
the ability of the phase-field-based IGP method for the convection of circular
and square interfaces with a prescribed velocity field. The variational FSI
framework with the IGP method is then examined for the flow passing a fixed
deformable block in a channel domain. Finally, the vibration of a plate
attached behind a stationary cylinder subjected to incoming flow is employed to
assess the fully Eulerian framework for a large aspect ratio and sharp corners.

we derive a tractable expression for the area spectral efficiency (ASE). A
lower bound on the ASE is also obtained, with which we then consider ASE
maximization, by optimizing the caching policy and IN coefficient. To solve the

up against narratives about the technical infeasibility of designing mechanisms
for accountability. While in recent AI ethics literature these concerns have
been deliberated predominantly in relation to ML, other instances in computing
history also presented circumstances in which computer scientists needed to
un-muddle what it means to design accountable systems. One such compelling
narrative can be found in canonical histories of the Internet that highlight
how its original designers' commitment to the ""End-to-End"" architectural
principle precluded other features from being implemented, resulting in the
fast-growing, generative, but ultimately unaccountable network we have today.
This paper offers a critique of such technologically essentialist notions of
accountability and the characterization of the ""unaccountable Internet"" as an
unintended consequence. It explores the changing meaning of accounting and its
relationship to accountability in a selected corpus of requests for comments
(RFCs) concerning the early Internet's design from the 1970s and 80s. We
characterize four ways of conceptualizing accounting: as billing, as
measurement, as management, and as policy, and demonstrate how an understanding
of accountability was constituted through these shifting meanings. We link
together the administrative and technical mechanisms of accounting for shared
resources in a distributed system and an emerging notion of accountability as a
social, political, and technical category, arguing that the former is
constitutive of the latter. Recovering this history is not only important for
understanding the processes that shaped the Internet, but also serves as a
starting point for unpacking the complicated political choices that are
involved in designing accountability mechanisms for other technological systems
today.

information. Two important tasks related to the automatic extraction and
analysis of information in Microblogs are Entity Mention Detection (EMD) and
Entity Detection (ED). The state-of-the-art EMD systems aim to model the
non-literary nature of microblog text by training upon offline static datasets.
They extract a combination of surface-level features -- orthographic, lexical,
and semantic -- from individual messages for noisy text modeling and entity
extraction. But given the constantly evolving nature of microblog streams,
detecting all entity mentions from such varying yet limited context of short
messages remains a difficult problem. To this end, we propose a framework named
EMD Globalizer, better suited for the execution of EMD learners on microblog
streams. It deviates from the processing of isolated microblog messages by
existing EMD systems, where learned knowledge from the immediate context of a
message is used to suggest entities. After an initial extraction of entity
candidates by an EMD system, the proposed framework leverages occurrence mining
to find additional candidate mentions that are missed during this first
detection. Aggregating the local contextual representations of these mentions,
a global embedding is drawn from the collective context of an entity candidate
within a stream. The global embeddings are then utilized to separate entities
within the candidates from false positives. All mentions of said entities from
the stream are produced in the framework's final outputs. Our experiments show
that EMD Globalizer can enhance the effectiveness of all existing EMD systems
that we tested (on average by 25.61%) with a small additional computational
overhead.

both frequency and space dimension are needed. Besides analysing them

effective ranking functions for posts on social media, it would be useful to
predict the affective response to a post (e.g., whether the user is likely to

recognition (which focuses on the affect of the publisher of the post), the
traditional approach to recognizing affective response would involve an

that is present in comments that are posted in response to a post, providing
high-precision evidence about the affective response of the readers to the post
without human annotation. Unlike human annotation, the annotation process we

particularly for new affective responses. We present experiments that
demonstrate that the CARE annotations compare favorably with crowd-sourced

dominantly measured by code contribution or community influence. Recent studies
on emergent leadership shed light on additional dimensions such as intellectual
stimulation in collaborative communications. To that end, this paper proposes
an automated approach, named iLead, to mine communication styles and identify
emergent leadership behaviors in OSS communities, using issue comments data. We
start with the construction of 6 categories of leadership behaviors based on
existing leadership studies. Then, we manually label leadership behaviors in
10,000 issue comments from 10 OSS projects, and extract 304 heuristic
linguistic patterns which represent different types of emergent leadership
behaviors in flexible and concise manners. Next, an automated algorithm is
developed to merge and consolidate different pattern sets extracted from
multiple projects into a final pattern ranking list, which can be applied for
the automatic leadership identification. The evaluation results show that iLead
can achieve a median precision of 0.82 and recall of 0.78, outperforming ten
machine/deep learning baselines. To demonstrate practical usefulness, we also
conduct empirical analysis and human evaluation of the identified leadership
behaviors from iLead. We argue that emergent leadership behaviors in issue
discussion should be taken into consideration to broaden existing OSS
leadership viewpoints. Practical insights on community building and leadership
skill development are offered for OSS community and individual developers,
respectively.

The unique property of alpha-MoO3 is that it contains three different types of
oxygen atoms occupying three Wyckoff sites that are absent in other
low-dimensional oxides and provides rich electronic hybridized states. The
presence of VO triggers intermediate state in the gap at ~0.59 eV below the
conduction band minimum and reduces the work function dramatically, together
with new excitations at near infrared. The realigned Fermi level associated
with the dangling state of VO reduces the neighboring Mo atoms and affects the
gas adsorption thereafter. The binding energy of H2O molecules above VO is 2.5
times up to -0.75 eV compared with that of perfect lattice site and trends of
transfer of electrons also reverse. The latter is related with the shallow
localized state in the band gap due to H2O adsorbed above perfect MoO3 which
becomes quenched upon adsorbing at the VO site. Those rich in-gap defective
states in oxygen deficient MoO3, broadening the light absorption and promoting
the uptake of water, are conductive to the application of alpha-MoO3 for

common residual species during the synthesis of lead-halide perovskites. There
currently exist some debates and uncertainties about the effect of excess PbI2
on the efficiency and stability of the solar cell with respect to its energy
alignment and energetics of defects. Herein, by applying the first-principles
calculations, we investigate the energetics, changes of work function and the
defective levels associated with the iodine vacancy (VI) and interstitial
iodine (II) defects of monolayer PbI2 (ML-PbI2). We find that the PbI2 has a
very low formation energy of VI of 0.77 and 0.19 eV for dilute and high
concentration, respectively, reflecting coalescence tendency of isolated VI,
much lower than that of vacancies in other 2D materials like phosphorene.
Similar to VI, a low formation energy of II of 0.65 eV is found, implying a
high population of such defects. Both defects generate in-gap defective levels
which are mainly due to the unsaturated chemical bonds of p-orbitals of exposed
Pb or inserted I. Such rich defective levels allow the VI and II as the
reservoir or sinks of electron/hole carriers in PbI2. Our results suggest that
the remnant PbI2 in perovskite MAPbI3 (or FAPbI3) would play dual opposite
roles in affecting the efficiency of the perovskite: (1) Forming Schottky-type
interface with MAPbI3 (or FAPbI3) in which the built-in potential would
facilitate the electron-hole separation and prolong the carrier lifetime; (2)
Acting as the recombination centers due to the deep defective levels. To
promote the efficiency by the Schottky effect, our work reveals that the II
defect is favored, and to reduce the recombination centers the VI defect should
be suppressed. Our results shall be beneficial in improving strategies for the
related optoelectronics applications.

investigate the interfacial electronic variation, thermal activation, and anode

different surface atomic groups in MXene can significantly alter the affinity,
redox reaction and kinetics of Li atoms in the interface of the Ti3C2T2 and

transport is well-developed, the treatment of high-field transport is much less
so, particularly for multi-phonon processes that are reported to be relevant in
GaAs. Here, we report a calculation of the high-field transport properties and
current power spectral density (PSD) of hot electrons in GaAs from first
principles including on-shell two-phonon (2ph) scattering. The on-shell 2ph
scattering rates are found to qualitatively alter the high-field distribution
function by increasing both the momentum and energy relaxation rates as well as
contributing markedly to intervalley scattering. This finding reconciles a
long-standing discrepancy regarding the strength of intervalley scattering in
GaAs as inferred from transport and optical studies. The characteristic
non-monotonic trend of PSD with electric field is not predicted at this level
of theory. Our work shows how \textit{ab initio} calculations of high-field
transport and noise may be used as a stringent test of the electron-phonon
interaction in semiconductors.

Zaccone and Baggioli have recently developed such a model based on overdamped
Langevin liquid dynamics. The model was proposed to be the universal law for
the vibrational density of states of liquids. Distinct from the Debye law,
g({\omega}) ~ {\omega}2, for solids, the universal law for liquids reveals a
linear relationship, g({\omega}) ~ {\omega}, in the low-energy region. The
universal law has been successfully verified with computer simulated VDOS for
Lennard-Jones liquids. We further confirm this universal law with experimental
VDOS measured by inelastic neutron scattering on real liquid systems including
water, liquid metal, and polymer liquids. We have applied this model and
extracted the effective relaxation rate for the short time dynamics for each
liquid. The model has been further evaluated in the predication of the specific
heat. The results have been compared with the existing experimental data as

its 2019 outburst, based on monitoring observations with Insight-HXMT and
Swift. Throughout the outburst, the spectra are well fitted with power-law plus
disk-blackbody components. In the soft-intermediate and soft states, we
observed the canonical relation L ~ T_in^4 between disk luminosity L and peak
colour temperature T_in, with a constant inner radius R_in (traditionally
identified with the innermost stable circular orbit). At other stages of the
outburst cycle, the behaviour is more unusual, inconsistent with the canonical
outburst evolution of black hole transients. In particular, during the hard
rise, the apparent inner radius is smaller than in the soft state (and
increasing), and the peak colour temperature is higher (and decreasing). This
anomalous behaviour is found even when we model the spectra with
self-consistent Comptonization models, which take into account the
up-scattering of photons from the disk component into the power-law component.
To explain both those anomalous trends at the same time, we suggest that the
hardening factor for the inner disk emission was larger than the canonical
value of ~1.7 at the beginning of the outburst. A more physical trend of radii
and temperature evolution requires a hardening factor evolving from ~3.5 at the
beginning of the hard state to ~1.7 in the hard intermediate state. This could
be evidence that the inner disk was in the process of condensing from the hot,
optically thin medium and had not yet reached a sufficiently high optical depth
for its emission spectrum to be described by the standard optically-thick disk
solution.

the perimeter of the root cluster and use it to establish that, at criticality,
the probability that the perimeter of the root cluster is equal to $n$ decays
like $n^{-4/3}$. Among these three exponents, only the last one was previously

triangulations sampled with a probability proportional to the energy of an
Ising configuration on their vertices, both in the finite and infinite volume
settings. This model is known to undergo a combinatorial phase transition at an
explicit critical temperature, for which its partition function has a different
asymptotic behavior than uniform maps. The purpose of this work is to give
geometric evidence of this phase transition.
  In the infinite volume setting, called the Infinite Ising Planar
Triangulation, we exhibit a phase transition for the existence of an infinite
spin cluster: for critical and supercritical temperatures, the root spin
cluster is finite almost surely, while it is infinite with positive probability
for subcritical temperatures. Remarkably, we are able to obtain an explicit
parametric expression for this probability, which allows to prove that the
percolation critical exponent is $\beta=1/4$.
  We also derive critical exponents for the tail distribution of the perimeter
and of the volume of the root spin cluster, both in the finite and infinite
volume settings. Finally, we establish the scaling limit of the interface of
the root spin cluster seen as a looptree. In particular in the whole
supercritical temperature regime, we prove that the critical exponents and the
looptree limit are the same as for critical Bernoulli site percolation.
  Our proofs mix combinatorial and probabilistic arguments. The starting point
is the gasket decomposition, which makes full use of the spatial Markov
property of our model. This decomposition enables us to characterize the root
spin cluster as a Boltzmann planar map in the finite volume setting. We then
combine precise combinatorial results obtained through analytic combinatorics
and universal features of Boltzmann maps to establish our results.

locomotion. Despite the rich literature on capturability analysis and push
recovery control for legged robots, existing tools are developed mainly for
bipeds or humanoids. Distinct quadrupedal features such as point contacts and
multiple swinging legs prevent direct application of these methods. To address
this gap, we propose a switched systems model for quadruped dynamics, and
instantiate the abstract viability concept for quadrupedal locomotion with a
time-based gait. Capturability is characterized through a novel specification
of dynamically balanced states that addresses the time-varying nature of
quadrupedal locomotion and balance. A linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model is
adopted to demonstrate the theory and show how the newly developed quadrupedal
capturability can be used in motion planning for quadrupedal push recovery. We
formulate and solve an explicit model predictive control (EMPC) problem whose
optimal solution fully characterizes quadrupedal capturability with the LIP.
Given this analysis, an optimization-based planning scheme is devised for
determining footsteps and center of mass references during push recovery. To
validate the effectiveness of the overall framework, we conduct numerous
simulation and hardware experiments. Simulation results illustrate the
necessity of considering dynamic balance for quadrupedal capturability, and the
significant improvement in disturbance rejection with the proposed strategy.
Experimental validations on a replica of the Mini Cheetah quadruped demonstrate
an up to 100% improvement as compared with state-of-the-art.

sender's message, even in the presence of noise. This generalizes the concept
of an error correcting code ($\mathsf{ECC}$), which is a non-interactive
$\mathsf{iECC}$ that is known to have erasure resilience capped at $\frac12$.
The work of \cite{GuptaTZ21} constructed the first $\mathsf{iECC}$ resilient to
$> \frac12$ adversarial erasures. However, their $\mathsf{iECC}$ has
communication complexity quadratic in the message size. In our work, we
construct the first positive rate $\mathsf{iECC}$ resilient to $> \frac12$
adversarial erasures. For any $\epsilon > 0$, our $\mathsf{iECC}$ is resilient
to $\frac6{11} - \epsilon$ adversarial erasures and has size $O_\epsilon(n)$.

inspired from a model introduced in the physics literature. The original model
consists of the customers of a single bank characterized by their capital, and
the discrete-time dynamics consists of monetary transactions in which a random
individual $x$ gives one coin to another random individual $y$, the transaction
being canceled when $x$ is in debt and there is no more coins to borrow from
the bank. Using a combination of numerical simulations and heuristic arguments,
physicists conjectured that the distribution of money (the distribution of the
number of coins owned by a given individual) at equilibrium converges to an
asymmetric Laplace distribution in the large population/temperature limit. In
this paper, we prove and extend this conjecture to a more general model
including multiple banks and interactions among customers across banks. More
importantly, our model assumes that customers are located on a general
undirected connected graph (as opposed to the complete graph in the original
model) where neighbors are interpreted as business partners, and transactions
occur along the edges, thus modeling the flow of money across a social network.
We show the convergence to the asymmetric Laplace distribution in the large
population/temperature limit for any graph, thus proving and extending the
conjecture from the physicists, and derive an exact expression of the
distribution of money for all population sizes and money temperatures.

often sacrifices interpretability, a critical consideration in many problems.
Here, we propose Fast Interpretable Greedy-Tree Sums (FIGS), an algorithm for
fitting concise rule-based models. Specifically, FIGS generalizes the CART
algorithm to simultaneously grow a flexible number of trees in a summation. The
total number of splits across all the trees can be restricted by a
pre-specified threshold, thereby keeping both the size and number of its trees
under control. When both are small, the fitted tree-sum can be easily
visualized and written out by hand, making it highly interpretable. A partially
oracle theoretical result hints at the potential for FIGS to overcome a key
weakness of single-tree models by disentangling additive components of
generative additive models, thereby reducing redundancy from repeated splits on
the same feature. Furthermore, given oracle access to optimal tree structures,
we obtain L2 generalization bounds for such generative models in the case of C1
component functions, matching known minimax rates in some cases. Extensive
experiments across a wide array of real-world datasets show that FIGS achieves
state-of-the-art prediction performance (among all popular rule-based methods)
when restricted to just a few splits (e.g. less than 20). We find empirically
that FIGS is able to avoid repeated splits, and often provides more concise
decision rules than fitted decision trees, without sacrificing predictive
performance. All code and models are released in a full-fledged package on

automatically generating general graphs. However, their advancement into
periodic graphs have not been well explored due to several key challenges in 1)
maintaining graph periodicity; 2) disentangling local and global patterns; and
3) efficiency in learning repetitive patterns. To address them, this paper
proposes Periodical-Graph Disentangled Variational Auto-encoder (PGD-VAE), a
new deep generative models for periodic graphs that can automatically learn,
disentangle, and generate local and global graph patterns. Specifically, we
develop a new periodic graph encoder consisting of global-pattern encoder and
local-pattern encoder that ensures to disentangle the representation into
global and local semantics. We then propose a new periodic graph decoder
consisting of local structure decoder, neighborhood decoder, and global

periodicity. Moreover, we design a new model learning objective that helps
ensure the invariance of local-semantic representations for the graphs with the

dense filaments in the Galactic plane, we find that the magnetic field is often
not perpendicular to the spine (i.e., the center-line of the bone). Fields tend
to be perpendicular in the densest areas of active star formation and more
parallel or random in other areas. The average field is neither parallel or

along the spine typically vary from $\sim$20 to $\sim$100\,$\mu$G. Magnetic
fields tend to be strong enough to suppress collapse along much of the bone,

less able to resist gravitational collapse.

supergravity models on Euclidean surfaces of arbitrary topology, Fredholm

holographic dual of the Lorentzian (super) gravity theory. These facts suggest
that the factorization puzzle is entirely resolved since the discrete spectrum
underlying the Schwarzian can have a sensible quantum mechanical origin in a

shown considerable improvements in time-series anomaly detection. However,

to their complex model designs or costly tuning procedures to find optimal

systems, specifically the subway ridership patterns in New York City.
Understanding the temporal pattern of subway ridership through statistical
models is crucial during such shocks. However, many existing statistical
frameworks may not be a good fit to analyze the ridership data sets during the
pandemic since some of the modeling assumption might be violated during this
time. In this paper, utilizing change point detection procedures, we propose a
piece-wise stationary time series model to capture the nonstationary structure
of subway ridership. Specifically, the model consists of several independent
station based autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models
concatenated together at certain time points. Further, data-driven algorithms
are utilized to detect the changes of ridership patterns as well as to estimate
the model parameters before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data sets of
focus are daily ridership of subway stations in New York City for randomly
selected stations. Fitting the proposed model to these data sets enhances our
understanding of ridership changes during external shocks, both in terms of
mean (average) changes as well as the temporal correlations.

aggregator has been advocated as an effective means to integrate such resources
into whole-sale energy markets. To ease market clearing, system operators allow
aggregators to submit bidding models of simple prespecified polytopic shapes.
Aggregators need to carefully design and commit to a polytope that best
captures their energy flexibility along a day-ahead scheduling horizon. This
work puts forth a model-informed data-based optimal flexibility design for
aggregators, which deals with the time-coupled, uncertain, and non-convex
models of individual loads. The proposed solution first generates efficiently a
labeled dataset of (non)-disaggregatable schedules. The feasible set of the
aggregator is then approximated by an ellipsoid upon training a convex
quadratic classifier using the labeled dataset. The ellipsoid is subsequently
inner approximated by a polytope. Using Farkas lemma, the obtained polytope is
finally inner approximated by the polytopic shape dictated by the market.
Numerical tests show the effectiveness of the proposed flexibility design
framework for designing the feasible sets of small- and large-sized aggregators
coordinating solar photovoltaics, thermostatically-controlled loads, batteries,
and electric vehicles. The tests further demonstrate that it is crucial for the
aggregator to consider time-coupling and uncertainties in optimal flexibility
design.

diagnostic potential of chromospheric emission from small-scale events. The Mg

liquidate a fixed quantity of an asset in the presence of market impact and

infinite horizon variation of the seminal model of Almgren and Chriss (2000),
but we define as the objective the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of the
implementation shortfall, and allow for dynamic (adaptive) trading strategies.
In this setting, we are able to derive closed-form expressions for the optimal
liquidation strategy and its value function.
  Our results yield a number of important practical insights. We are able to
quantify the benefit of adaptive policies over optimized static policies. The
relevant improvement depends only on the level of risk aversion: for moderate
levels of risk aversion, the optimal dynamic policy outperforms the optimal
static policy by 5-15%, and outperforms the optimal volume weighted average
price (VWAP) policy by 15-25%. This improvement is achieved through dynamic
policies that exhibit ""aggressiveness-in-the-money"": trading is accelerated
when price movements are favorable, and is slowed when price movements are
unfavorable.
  From a mathematical perspective, our analysis exploits the dual
representation of CVaR to convert the problem to a continuous-time, zero-sum
game. We leverage the idea of the state-space augmentation, and obtain a
partial differential equation describing the optimal value function, which is
separable and a special instance of the Emden-Fowler equation. This leads to a
closed-form solution. As our problem is a special case of a

the complete availability of data across all levels of the temporal hierarchy,
while this offers mathematical convenience but most of the time low frequency
data is partially completed and it is not available while forecasting. On the
other hand, high frequency data can significantly change in a scenario like the
COVID pandemic and this change can be used to improve forecasts that will

to hold for submatrices where neurons are stably-activated in all training

Our proof relies on a specific decomposition of the network into a multilinear

has led to improvements in generalization, data efficiency, and physical
consistency in dynamics modeling. Methods such as CNNs or equivariant neural
networks use weight tying to enforce symmetries such as shift invariance or
rotational equivariance. However, despite the fact that physical laws obey many
symmetries, real-world dynamical data rarely conforms to strict mathematical
symmetry either due to noisy or incomplete data or to symmetry breaking
features in the underlying dynamical system. We explore approximately
equivariant networks which are biased towards preserving symmetry but are not
strictly constrained to do so. By relaxing equivariance constraints, we find
that our models can outperform both baselines with no symmetry bias and
baselines with overly strict symmetry in both simulated turbulence domains and
real-world multi-stream jet flow.

that estimating a model comprising R- and Q-factors has to face loading
indeterminacy beyond rotational indeterminacy. Although R-factor analysis of

possible, this may lead to model error. Accordingly, even in the population,
the resulting R-factor loadings are not necessarily close estimates of the

large Q-factor variance induces an increase of the variation of R-factor
loading estimates beyond chance level. The results indicate that performing
R-factor analysis with data based on a population model comprising R- and

from four GAN algorithms, the pseudo labels from image quality assessment (IQA)
measures, as well as the human opinion scores via subjective testing.
Subsequently, we develop a quality assessment model that is able to deliver
accurate quality predictions for GFIs from both available and unseen GAN
algorithms based on meta-learning. In particular, to learn shared knowledge
from GFIs pairs that are born of limited GAN algorithms, we develop the
convolutional block attention (CBA) and facial attributes-based analysis (ABA)

visual perception. Extensive experiments exhibit that the proposed model
achieves better performance compared with the state-of-the-art IQA models, and

recent work in the Out-of-Distribution literature, we propose a gradient masked

averaging of client updates. This client update aggregation technique can be
adapted as a drop-in replacement in most existing federated algorithms. We
perform extensive experiments with gradient masked approach on multiple FL

field of soft tissue repair and tissue engineering. These scaffolds made of
porous bioelastomers support tissue ingrowth along with their own degradation.
It is necessary to develop a computer-aided analyzing method based on
ultrasound images to identify the degradation performance of the scaffold, not
only to obviate the need to do destructive testing, but also to monitor the
scaffold's degradation and tissue ingrowth over time. It is difficult using a
single traditional image processing algorithm to extract continuous and
accurate contour of a porous bioelastomer. This paper proposes a joint
algorithm for the bioelastomer's contour detection and a texture feature
extraction method for monitoring the degradation behavior of the bioelastomer.
Mean-shift clustering method is used to obtain the bioelastomer's and native
tissue's clustering feature information. Then the OTSU image binarization
method automatically selects the optimal threshold value to convert the
grayscale ultrasound image into a binary image. The Canny edge detector is used
to extract the complete bioelastomer's contour. The first-order and
second-order statistical features of texture are extracted. The proposed joint
algorithm not only achieves the ideal extraction of the bioelastomer's contours
in ultrasound images, but also gives valuable feedback of the degradation
behavior of the bioelastomer at the implant site based on the changes of
texture characteristics and contour area. The preliminary results of this study
suggest that the proposed computer-aided image processing techniques have

batch size is important for training GANs with TTURs and they both affect the
number of steps needed for training. This paper studies the relationship
between batch size and the number of steps needed for training GANs with TTURs
based on constant learning rates. We theoretically show that, for a TTUR with
constant learning rates, the number of steps needed to find stationary points
of the loss functions of both the discriminator and generator decreases as the
batch size increases and that there exists a critical batch size minimizing the
stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Then, we use the Fr'echet
inception distance (FID) as the performance measure for training and provide
numerical results indicating that the number of steps needed to achieve a low
FID score decreases as the batch size increases and that the SFO complexity
increases once the batch size exceeds the measured critical batch size.
Moreover, we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes

accuracies in various natural language processing domains by adapting to
downstream tasks via zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuning techniques. Because of
their success, the size of these models has increased rapidly, requiring
high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic techniques to enable
training such large models. As the result of a joint effort between Microsoft
and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest monolithic
transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG), with 530
billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure as well
as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed and
Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training
corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient
to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results, as
well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG.
We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning
accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art
results. We believe that our contributions will help further the development of
large-scale training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural
language generations.

ability to receive information sequentially encoded by every other agent at
each time step, leading to improved global cooperation. We demonstrate FCMNet
on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks with shared rewards,

Here, we show that decoherence can significantly modify this conclusion: by
resorting to the adiabatic master equation approach, we simulate the dynamics
of the ferromagnetic $p$-spin model with $p=3$ under independent and collective
dephasing. For both models of decoherence, we show that the performance of open

efficient combination of such connections can reduce the number of parameters
drastically while maintaining the restoration quality. In this paper, we

multiple residual connections in intermediate layers (referred to as
Multi-Residual Dense Blocks), which improves gradient propagation in existing

a network to produce results which have high PSNRs but are perceptually

bombarding a low-energy proton beam onto a beryllium or lithium target. In such
an accelerator-based neutron source, a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) is
usually utilized to accelerate a high-intensity proton beam to a few MeV. This
study mainly covers the high-frequency structure design optimizations of a
4-vane RFQ with pi-mode stabilizer loops (PISLs) and its RF stability analysis.
A 176 MHz RFQ accelerator is designed to operate at a 10% duty factor and could
accelerate an 80 mA proton beam from 65 keV to 2.5 MeV within a length of 5.3
m. The adoption of PISLs ensures high RF stability, eases the operation of the
accelerator, and implies less stringent alignment and machining tolerances.

mechanical pressure. In designing built-in strategies however, manufacturers
usually build the sensor around the biofouling system. The current
state-of-the-art is a fully integrated central wiper in the sensor that enables
cleaning of all probes mounted on the sonde. Improvements in antifouling
strategies lag rapid advancements in sensor technologies such as in
miniaturization, specialization, and costs. Hence, improving built-in designs
by decreasing size and complexity will decrease maintenance and overall costs.
  This design is targeted for the EU project Robocoenosis since bio-hybrid
systems in this project incorporate living organisms. This technology targets
selective proliferation of the organisms which only prevents biofilms on
components where they are unwanted. Beyond this, the use of autonomous

the need for human inspection and maintenance. In addition to Robocoenosis, we

already been studied. However, this model cannot handle the heterogeneity of

non-Gaussian data. A classical imputation method, the Expectation Maximization
(EM) algorithm for Gaussian mixture models, has shown interesting properties
when compared to other popular approaches such as those based on k-nearest
neighbors or on multiple imputations by chained equations. However, Gaussian
mixture models are known to be non-robust to heterogeneous data, which can lead
to poor estimation performance when the data is contaminated by outliers or
follows non-Gaussian distributions. To overcome this issue, a new EM algorithm
is investigated for mixtures of elliptical distributions with the property of
handling potential missing data. This paper shows that this problem reduces to
the estimation of a mixture of Angular Gaussian distributions under generic
assumptions (i.e., each sample is drawn from a mixture of elliptical
distributions, which is possibly different for one sample to another). In that
case, the complete-data likelihood associated with mixtures of elliptical
distributions is well adapted to the EM framework with missing data thanks to
its conditional distribution, which is shown to be a multivariate
$t$-distribution. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm is robust to outliers and can be used with non-Gaussian
data. Furthermore, experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that this
algorithm is very competitive when compared to other classical imputation
methods.

presented as an application of nonholonomic partitioned Runge-Kutta Munthe-Kaas
(RKMK) methods on Lie groups.
  A homogeneous space $M$ is a manifold where a group $G$ acts transitively.
Such a space can be understood as a quotient $M \cong G/H$, where $H$ a closed
Lie subgroup, is the isotropy group of each point of $M$. The Lie algebra of
$G$ may be decomposed into $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{m} \oplus \mathfrak{h}$,
where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the subalgebra that generates $H$ and $\mathfrak{m}$ is
a subspace. Thus, variational problems on $M$ can be treated as
nonholonomically constrained problems on $G$, by requiring variations to remain
on $\mathfrak{m}$.
  Nonholonomic partitioned RKMK integrators are derived as a modification of
those obtained by a discrete variational principle on Lie groups, and can be
interpreted as obeying a discrete Chetaev principle. These integrators tend to
preserve several properties of their purely variational counterparts.

complex DL models on distributed compute devices. Alpa distributes the training
of large DL models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels:
inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on it, Alpa constructs a

a number of compilation passes to automatically derive efficient parallel
execution plans at each parallelism level. Alpa implements an efficient runtime

memory throughput has not increased at the same rate, which has led to the
memory wall problem in turn increasing the gap between effective and
theoretical peak processor performance. To cope with this, there has been an
abundance of work in the area of data/instruction prefetcher designs. Broadly,
prefetchers predict future data/instruction address accesses and proactively
fetch data/instructions in the memory hierarchy with the goal of lowering
data/instruction access latency. To this end, one or more prefetchers are
deployed at each level of the memory hierarchy, but typically, each prefetcher
gets designed in isolation without comprehensively accounting for other
prefetchers in the system. As a result, individual prefetchers do not always
complement each other, and that leads to lower average performance gains and/or
many negative outliers. In this work, we propose Puppeteer, which is a hardware
prefetcher manager that uses a suite of random forest regressors to determine
at runtime which prefetcher should be ON at each level in the memory hierarchy,
such that the prefetchers complement each other and we reduce the
data/instruction access latency. Compared to a design with no prefetchers,
using Puppeteer we improve IPC by 46.0% in 1 Core (1C), 25.8% in 4 Core (4C),
and 11.9% in 8 Core (8C) processors on average across traces generated from
SPEC2017, SPEC2006, and Cloud suites with ~10KB overhead. Moreover, we also
reduce the number of negative outliers by over 89%, and the performance loss of
the worst-case negative outlier from 25% to only 5% compared to the

Inspired by recent success in neural algorithmic reasoning, we propose a novel
graph neural network to estimate extended persistence diagrams (EPDs) on graphs
efficiently. Our model is built on algorithmic insights, and benefits from
better supervision and closer alignment with the EPD computation algorithm. We
validate our method with convincing empirical results on approximating EPDs and

systems, in particular topological superconductors and topological insulators,
has remained a major challenge for the physics of quantum matter in the last
two decades. Here we show that the end-to-end, long-distance, bipartite
squashed entanglement between the edges of a many-body system, defined in terms
of the edge-to-edge quantum conditional mutual information, is the natural
nonlocal order parameter for topological superconductors in one dimension as
well as in quasi one-dimensional geometries. For the Kitaev chain in the entire
topological phase, the edge squashed entanglement is quantized to log(2)/2,
half the maximal Bell-state entanglement, and vanishes in the trivial phase.
Such topological squashed entanglement exhibits the correct scaling at the
quantum phase transition, is stable in the presence of interactions, and is
robust against disorder and local perturbations. Edge quantum conditional
mutual information and edge squashed entanglement defined with respect to
different multipartitions discriminate topological superconductors from
symmetry breaking magnets, as shown by comparing the fermionic Kitaev chain and
the spin-1/2 Ising model in transverse field. For systems featuring multiple
topological phases with different numbers of edge modes, like the quasi 1D
Kitaev ladder, topological squashed entanglement counts the number of Majorana
excitations and distinguishes the different topological phases of the system.
In fact, we show that the edge quantum conditional mutual information and the
edge squashed entanglement remain valid detectors of topological
superconductivity even for systems, like the Kitaev tie with long-range
hopping, featuring geometrical frustration and a suppressed bulk-edge
correspondence.

Cosine Transform (MDCT), is the most widespread approach to audio coding.
However, at low bitrates, audio quality, especially for speech, degrades
drastically due to the lack of available bits to directly code the transform
coefficients. Traditionally, post-filtering has been used to mitigate artefacts
in the coded speech by exploiting a-priori information of the source and extra
transmitted parameters. Recently, data-driven post-filters have shown better
results, but at the cost of significant additional complexity and delay. In
this work, we propose a mask-based post-filter operating directly in MDCT
domain of the codec, inducing no extra delay. The real-valued mask is applied
to the quantized MDCT coefficients and is estimated from a relatively
lightweight convolutional encoder-decoder network. Our solution is tested on
the recently standardized low-delay, low-complexity codec (LC3) at lowest
possible bitrate of 16 kbps. Objective and subjective assessments clearly show
the advantage of this approach over the conventional post-filter, with an
average improvement of 10 MUSHRA points over the LC3 coded speech.

Finite periodic structures consist of a bounded number of unit cell

designed to efficiently control and manipulate sound waves and are referred to

into boxes which correspond to the unit cell. A boundary element discretization
is applied and interactions between well separated boxes are approximated by a

certain operators of the expansion become block Toeplitz matrices. This allows

videos growing exponentially every year and the organization known as Deeptrace
had estimated an increase of deepfakes by 84% from the year 2018 to 2019. They
are used to generate and modify human faces, where most of the existing fake

this paper, available video datasets are identified and a pretrained model
BlazeFace is used to detect faces, and a ResNet and Xception ensembled
architectured neural network trained on the dataset to achieve the goal of
detection of fake faces in videos. The model is optimized over a loss value and
log loss values and evaluated over its F1 score. Over a sample of data, it is
observed that focal loss provides better accuracy, F1 score and loss as the
gamma of the focal loss becomes a hyper parameter. This provides a k-folded
accuracy of around 91% at its peak in a training cycle with the real world
accuracy subjected to change over time as the model decays.

variables (SoV) program for high-rank integrable spin chains and the boost
mechanism for solving the Yang-Baxter equation. We begin with a general
overview of quantum integrable systems with special emphasis on their
description in terms of quantum algebras. We then provide a detailed account of
the Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ in particular the Bethe algebra, fusion, and
T- and Q-systems. We then introduce the notion of separation of variables in
integrable systems and build on Sklyanin's work in rank 1 models and extend to
higher rank. By exploiting a novel link between SoV and quantum algebra
representation theory we construct the separated variables for
$\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ spin chains for arbitrary compact representations of the
symmetry algebra and develop various new tools along the way. Next, we build on
the previous part and develop a new technique for the computation of scalar
products in the SoV framework which we call Functional SoV or FSoV. Unlike the
work in the previous, operatorial, part this approach is based on the Baxter TQ
equations. After developing this technique we supplement it with a new operator
construction providing a unified view of functional and operatorial SoV. Then,
we generalise the results of the previous part from compact spin chains to
non-compact spin chains. The final part of this work is based on the
development of tools for solving the Yang- Baxter equation. We develop a
bottom-up approach for this based on the so-called Boost automorphism and uses
the spin chain Hamiltonian as a starting point. Our approach allows us to
classify numerous families of solutions in particular a complete classification
of 4 x 4 solutions which preserve fermion number which have applications in the
AdS/CFT correspondence.

fuel cell, a sophisticated water management is crucial. Therefore, it is
necessary to understand the transport mechanisms of water throughout the cell
constituents especially on the cathode side, where the excess water has to be
removed. Pore-scale modeling of diffusion layers and gas distributor has been
established as a favorable technique to investigate the ongoing processes.
  Investigating the interface between the cathode layers, a particular
challenge is the combination and interaction of the multi-phase flow in the
porous material of the gas diffusion layer (GDL) with the free flow in the gas
distributor channels. The formation, growth and detachment of water droplets on
the hydrophobic, porous surface of the GDL have a major influence on the mass,
momentum and energy exchange between the layers.
  A dynamic pore-network model is used to describe the flow through the porous
GDL on the pore-scale. To capture the droplet occurrence and its influence on
the flow, this dynamic two-phase pore-network model is extended to capture
droplet formation and growth at the surface of the GDL as well as droplet
detachment due to the gas flow in the gas distributor channels. In this
article, the developed model is applied to single- and multi-tube systems to
investigate the general drop behavior. These rather simple test-cases are
compared to experimental and numerical data available in the literature.
Finally, the model is applied to a GDL unit cell to analyse the interaction
between two-phase flow through the GDL and drop formation at the interface
between GDL and gas distributor channel.

widely used in spectral clustering and manifold learning. The use of Laplacian
eigenvectors as embeddings for the purpose of multiscale graph comparison has
however been limited. Here we propose the Embedded Laplacian Discrepancy (ELD)
as a simple and fast approach to compare graphs (of potentially different
sizes) based on the similarity of the graphs' community structures. The ELD
operates by representing graphs as point clouds in a common, low-dimensional
space, on which a natural Wasserstein-based distance can be efficiently
computed. A main challenge in comparing graphs through any eigenvector-based
approaches is the potential ambiguity that could arise due to sign-flips and
basis symmetries. The ELD leverages a simple symmetrization trick to bypass any
sign ambiguities. For comparing graphs that do not have any ambiguities due to
basis symmetries (i.e. the spectrums are simple), we show that the ELD becomes
a natural pseudo-metric that enjoys nice properties such as invariance under
graph isomorphism. For comparing graphs with non-simple spectrums, we propose a
procedure to approximate the ELD via a simple perturbation technique to resolve
any ambiguity from basis symmetries. We show that such perturbations are stable
using matrix perturbation theory under mild assumptions that are
straightforward to verify in practice. We demonstrate the excellent
applicability of the ELD approach on both simulated and real datasets.

of a mass-complete sample of $>10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$ main-sequence (MS) galaxies
at $0.4<z<3.6$. We apply an innovative $uv$-based stacking analysis to a large
set of archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
observations. This stacking analysis provides measurements of the mean mass and
extent of the molecular gas of galaxy populations. The molecular gas mass of MS
galaxies evolves with redshift and stellar mass. At all stellar masses, the
molecular gas fraction decreases by a factor of 24 from $z\sim3.2$ to $z\sim0$.
At a given redshift, the molecular gas fraction of MS galaxies decreases with
stellar mass, at roughly the same rate as their specific star formation rate
decreases. The molecular gas depletion time of MS galaxies remains roughly
constant at $z>0.5$ with a value of 300--500 Myr, but increases by a factor of
3 from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0$. This evolution of the molecular gas depletion
time of MS galaxies can be predicted from the evolution of their molecular gas
surface density and a seemingly universal MS-only $\Sigma_{M_{\rm
mol}}-\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation with an inferred slope of 1.13, i.e., the
so-called KS relation. The far-infrared size of MS galaxies shows no
significant evolution with redshift or stellar mass, with a mean circularized
half-light radius of 2.2 kpc. Finally, our mean molecular gas masses are lower
than previous estimates, likely caused by the fact that literature studies were
biased towards individually-detected MS galaxies with massive gas reservoirs.
To first order, the molecular gas content of MS galaxies regulates their star
formation across cosmic time, while variation of their star formation
efficiency plays a secondary role. Despite a large evolution of their gas
content and SFRs, MS galaxies evolved along a seemingly universal MS-only KS
relation.

providing recommendations to decision makers facing problems, based on
available theoretical knowledge and empirical data. Although this activity is
often seen as being concerned with solving mathematical problems and conceiving
algorithms, it is essentially an empirical and socially framed activity, where
interactions between clients and analysts, and between them and concerned third
parties, play a crucial role. Since the 80s, two concepts have structured the
literature devoted to analysing this aspect of decision support: validity and
legitimacy. Whereas validity is focused on the interactions between the client
and the analyst, legitimacy refers to the broader picture: the organisational
context, the overall problem situation, the environment, culture, history.
Despite its importance, this concept has not received the attention it deserves
in the literature in decision support. The present paper aims at filling this
gap. For that purpose, we review the literature in other disciplines relevant
to elaborate a concept of legitimacy useful in decision support contexts. Based
on this review, we propose a general theory of legitimacy, adapted to decision
support contexts, encompassing the relevant contributions we found in the
literature. According to this general theory, a legitimate decision support
intervention is one for which the decision support provider produces a
justification that satisfies two conditions: (i) it effectively convinces the
decision support provider's interlocutors (effectiveness condition) and (ii) it
is organised around the active elicitation of as many and as diverse
counterarguments as possible (truthfulness condition). Despite its conceptual
simplicity, legitimacy, understood in this sense, is a very exacting
requirement, opening ambitious research avenues that we delineate.

the identified inverse dynamics. However, the flexible nature of neural

may result in parameters of the physical model not corresponding to their

which controllers are active at each stage of the Challenge. In the first stage
our UGV uses visual servoing and local controllers to approach the target
object without considering its orientation. The second stage consists of
detecting the object's global pose using OpenCV-based processing of RGB-D image

The map is built with Google Cartographer and is based on onboard LIDAR, IMU,

Base package with Time-Elastic Band trajectory optimization. Visual servo
algorithms guide the vehicle in local object-approach movement and the arm in
manipulating bricks. To ensure a stable grasp of the brick's magnetic patch, we
developed a passively-compliant, electromagnetic gripper with tactile feedback.

of agents is organized in a fixed network structure. There is a binary state of
the world and each agent receives a private signal on the state. We model
beliefs as urns where red balls represent one possible value of the state and
blue balls the other value. The model revolves purely around communication and
beliefs dynamics. Communication happens in discrete time and, at each period,
agents draw and display one ball from their urn with replacement. Then, they
reinforce their urns by adding balls of the colors drawn by their neighbors. We
show that for any network structure, this process converges almost-surely to a
stable state. Futher, we show that if the communication network is connected,
this stable state is such that all urns have the same proportion of balls. This
result strengthens the main convergence properties of non-Bayesian learning
models. Yet, contrary to those models, we show that this limit proportion is a
full-support random variable. This implies that an arbitrarily small proportion
of misinformed agents can substantially change the value of the limit
consensus. We propose a set of conjectures on the distribution of this limit
proportion based on simulations. In particular, we show evidence that the limit
belief follows a beta distribution and that its average value is independent

paradigm for NLP, which only depends on the representation of the words by
freezing the parameters of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to obtain
remarkable performance on downstream tasks. It maintains the consistency of
Masked Language Model (MLM) \cite{devlin2018bert} task in the process of
pre-training, and avoids some issues that may happened during fine-tuning.
Naturally, we consider that the ""[MASK]"" tokens carry more useful information
than other tokens because the model combines with context to predict the masked
tokens. Among the current prompt tuning methods, there will be a serious
problem of random composition of the answer tokens in prediction when they
predict multiple words so that they have to map tokens to labels with the help
verbalizer. In response to the above issue, we propose a new \textbf{Pro}mpt
\textbf{Tu}ning based on ""[\textbf{M}ASK]"" (\textbf{Protum}) method in this
paper, which constructs a classification task through the information carried
by the hidden layer of ""[MASK]"" tokens and then predicts the labels directly
rather than the answer tokens. At the same time, we explore how different
hidden layers under ""[MASK]"" impact on our classification model on many
different data sets. Finally, we find that our \textbf{Protum} can achieve much
better performance than fine-tuning after continuous pre-training with less
time consumption. Our model facilitates the practical application of large

prove thermodynamic upper and lower bounds on the one-shot classical capacity

by the extractable work from classical correlation maintained by the
transmission channel, subject to additional thermodynamic constraints depending
on the chosen class of superchannels. It provides the physical message that, in
the one-shot regime, transmitting $n$ bits of classical information through a
channel is equivalent to $n\times k_BT\ln2$ extractable work from the
maintained classical correlation, consequently revealing the thermodynamic
criterion that is necessary to transmit classical information. This result can
be further extended to the asymptotic regime, providing thermodynamic meanings
for Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem. Finally, our study suggests that
work extraction is closely related to resource theories of channels. To

small samples, including those lacking in-plane symmetry, extending the current
limit of the measurable k_in to as low as 1 W/(m K). This SSTR method
establishes a new scheme of measurements using the optimized laser spot size

measurements of in-plane thermal conductivity tensors of a broad range of k_in

the effects of different system parameters on the achievable rate. Our analysis

  Explanations through Local Invariant Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Locally interpretable model agnostic explanations (LIME) method is one of the
most popular methods used to explain black-box models at a per example level.
Although many variants have been proposed, few provide a simple way to produce
high fidelity explanations that are also stable and intuitive. In this work, we
provide a novel perspective by proposing a model agnostic local explanation
method inspired by the invariant risk minimization (IRM) principle --
originally proposed for (global) out-of-distribution generalization -- to
provide such high fidelity explanations that are also stable and unidirectional
across nearby examples. Our method is based on a game theoretic formulation
where we theoretically show that our approach has a strong tendency to
eliminate features where the gradient of the black-box function abruptly
changes sign in the locality of the example we want to explain, while in other
cases it is more careful and will choose a more conservative (feature)
attribution, a behavior which can be highly desirable for recourse.
Empirically, we show on tabular, image and text data that the quality of our
explanations with neighborhoods formed using random perturbations are much
better than LIME and in some cases even comparable to other methods that use
realistic neighbors sampled from the data manifold. This is desirable given
that learning a manifold to either create realistic neighbors or to project
explanations is typically expensive or may even be impossible. Moreover, our
algorithm is simple and efficient to train, and can ascertain stable input
features for local decisions of a black-box without access to side information
such as a (partial) causal graph as has been seen in some recent works.

that the mean temperature increases to 0.9 keV. Apart from the flares, there is
no significant change in the flux and hardness of the coronal emission on a
timescale of several months to years. Thus, we conclude that there is no
detectable activity cycle on such timescales. We identified the flares and
built their energy distribution. The number of flares observed around the
phases of the planetary eclipses is not statistically different from the number
of flares during transit phases. However, we do find a hint of a difference in
the flare-energy distributions, as the flares observed around the planetary
eclipses tend to be more energetic than the flares observed around the primary
transits of the planet. We modeled the distribution of the number of flares per
day with a power law, showing that it is steeper than the one observed in the
Sun and in other Main Sequence stars. The steepness hints at a significant
fraction of undetected micro-flares. Altogether, the plasma temperatures below
1 keV observed during the flares, along with the slightly larger fraction of
energetic flares seen at the secondary transits highlight the peculiarity of
the corona of HD 189733 A and points to star-planet interaction as the
plausible origin of part of its X-ray emission. However, more observational and

individual differences, the best subband differs among subjects and is

STRCA method by a feature selection on multiple subbands and avoid the
selection of best subbands. This study first compares three frequency range
settings ($M_1$: subbands with equally spaced bandwidths; $M_2$: subbands whose
high cut-off frequencies are twice the low cut-off frequencies; $M_3$: subbands
that start at some specific fixed frequencies and end at the frequencies in an

show that $M_3$ is a better setting than the other two settings. With the

an important role in the detection of movement before limbs actually move.
Movement-related cortical potential is a kind of brain activity associated with
pre-movement decoding. In current studies, patterns decoded from movement are
mainly applied to the binary classification between movement state and resting
state, such as elbow flexion and rest. The classifications between two movement
states and among multiple movement states are still challenging. This study
proposes a new method, the star-arrangement spectral filtering (SASF), to solve
the multi-class pre-movement classification problem. We first design a
referenced task-related component analysis (RTRCA) framework that consists of
two modules. This first module is the classification between movement state and
resting state; the second module is the classification of multiple movement
states. SASF is developed by optimizing the features in RTRCA. In SASF, feature
selection on filter banks is used on the first module of RTRCA, and feature
selection on time windows is used on the second module of RTRCA. A linear
discriminant analysis classifier is used to classify the optimized features. In
the binary classification between two motions, the classification accuracy of
SASF achieves 0.9670$\pm$0.0522, which is significantly higher than the result
provided by the deep convolutional neural network (0.6247$\pm$0.0680) and the
discriminative spatial pattern method (0.4400$\pm$0.0700). In the multi-class
classification of 7 states, the classification accuracy of SASF is
0.9491$\pm$0.0372. The proposed SASF greatly improves the classification
between two motions and enables the classification among multiple motions. The
result shows that the movement can be decoded from EEG signals before the
actual limb movement.

gapless modes at the edge. These edge modes may propagate downstream or
upstream, and may support either charge or charge-neutral excitations. From
topological considerations, particle-like QH states are expected to support
only downstream charge modes. However the interplay between the electronic
repulsion and the boundary confining potential may drive certain quantum phase
transitions (called reconstructions) at the edge, which are associated to the
nucleation of additional pairs of counter-propagating modes. Employing
variational methods, here we study edge reconstruction in the prototypical
particle-like phases at $\nu = 1, 1/3$ and $2/5$ as a function of the slope of
the confining potential. Our analysis shows that subsequent renormalization of
the edge modes, driven by disorder-induced tunnelling and intermode
interactions, may lead to the emergence of upstream neutral modes. These
predictions may be tested in suitably designed transport experiments. Our
results are also consistent with previous observations of upstream neutral
modes in these QH phases, and could explain the absence of anyonic interference
in electronic Mach-Zehnder setups.

arrive sequentially and their valuations for the item being sold depend on a
random, unknown state of nature. The seller has complete knowledge of the
actual state and can send signals to the buyers so as to disclose information
about it. For instance, the state of nature may reflect the condition and/or
some particular features of the item, which are known to the seller only. The
problem faced by the seller is about how to partially disclose information
about the state so as to maximize revenue. Unlike classical signaling problems,
in this setting, the seller must also correlate the signals being sent to the
buyers with some price proposals for them. This introduces additional
challenges compared to standard settings. We consider two cases: the one where
the seller can only send signals publicly visible to all buyers, and the case
in which the seller can privately send a different signal to each buyer. As a
first step, we prove that, in both settings, the problem of maximizing the
seller's revenue does not admit an FPTAS unless P=NP, even for basic instances
with a single buyer. As a result, in the rest of the paper, we focus on
designing PTASs. In order to do so, we first introduce a unifying framework
encompassing both public and private signaling, whose core result is a
decomposition lemma that allows focusing on a finite set of possible buyers'
posteriors. This forms the basis on which our PTASs are developed. In
particular, in the public signaling setting, our PTAS employs some ad hoc
techniques based on linear programming, while our PTAS for the private setting
relies on the ellipsoid method to solve an exponentially-sized LP in polynomial
time. In the latter case, we need a custom approximate separation oracle, which
we implement with a dynamic programming approach.

X-ray imaging is a fast, non-invasive and widely applicable method for foreign
object detection. Deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful approach for
recognizing patterns in radiographs (i.e., X-ray images), enabling automated
X-ray based foreign object detection. However, these methods require a large
number of training examples and manual annotation of these examples is a
subjective and laborious task. In this work, we propose a Computed Tomography
(CT) based method for producing training data for supervised learning of
foreign object detection, with minimal labour requirements. In our approach, a
few representative objects are CT scanned and reconstructed in 3D. The
radiographs that have been acquired as part of the CT-scan data serve as input
for the machine learning method. High-quality ground truth locations of the
foreign objects are obtained through accurate 3D reconstructions and
segmentations. Using these segmented volumes, corresponding 2D segmentations
are obtained by creating virtual projections. We outline the benefits of
objectively and reproducibly generating training data in this way compared to
conventional radiograph annotation. In addition, we show how the accuracy
depends on the number of objects used for the CT reconstructions. The results
show that in this workflow generally only a relatively small number of
representative objects (i.e., fewer than 10) are needed to achieve adequate
detection performance in an industrial setting. Moreover, for real experimental
data we show that the workflow leads to higher foreign object detection
accuracies than with standard radiograph annotation.

with fine-grained tasking to achieve high performance and scalability. However,
reducing the total energy consumption in the context of work stealing runtimes
is still challenging, particularly when using asymmetric architectures with
different types of CPU cores. A common approach for energy savings involves
dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) wherein throttling is carried out
based on factors like task parallelism, stealing relations and task
criticality. This paper makes the following observations: (i) leveraging DVFS
on a per-task basis is impractical when using fine-grained tasking and in
environments with cluster/chip-level DVFS; (ii) task moldability, wherein a
single task can execute on multiple threads/cores via work-sharing, can help to
reduce energy consumption; and (iii) mismatch between tasks and assigned
resources (i.e.~core type and number of cores) can detrimentally impact energy
consumption. In this paper, we propose ERASE (EneRgy Aware SchedulEr), an
intra-application task scheduler on top of work stealing runtimes that aims to
reduce the total energy consumption of parallel applications. It achieves
energy savings by guiding scheduling decisions based on per-task energy
consumption predictions of different resource configurations. In addition,
ERASE is capable of adapting to both given static frequency settings and
externally controlled DVFS. Overall, ERASE achieves up to 31% energy savings

to produce a long-lived, dim, red transient known as a failed supernova.
Despite the detection of a number of candidates for disappearing massive stars

galaxies from the PTF/ZTF surveys. This analysis recovers known supernovae, and
yields a number of interesting transients. However, none of these are
consistent with a failed supernova. Through Monte Carlo tests the recovery
efficiency of our pipeline is quantified. By assuming failed supernovae occur
as a Poissonian process with zero detections in the data set, 95 per cent upper

chaining: 1) the metric space is not necessarily bounded, 2) facilitation of
subsequent analysis to yield more explicit bound, and 3) further opportunity to
optimize the bound by removing the geometric rigidity of the partitions. The
proposed approach includes the traditional chaining as a special case, and can
therefore also utilize any deterministic chaining construction. We illustrate
these benefits using the problem of estimating Gaussian mean and that of phase

the function and its first order derivative are used to reconstruct both the
function and its first order derivative values at the boundaries. However, in
this paper, only the function values at the Gauss-Lobatto points in the one or
two dimensional case need to be reconstructed by using the information of the
zeroth and first order moments. In addition, an extra modification procedure is
used to modify those first order moments in the troubled-cells, which leads to
an improvement of stability and an enhancement of resolution near
discontinuities. To obtain the same order of accuracy, the size of the stencil
required by this moment-based multi-resolution HWENO scheme is still the same
as the general HWENO scheme and is more compact than the general WENO scheme.
Moreover, the linear weights can also be any positive numbers as long as their

distributed computing. An MPC protocol allows a set of $n$ mutually distrusting
parties to carry out any joint computation of their private inputs, without
disclosing any additional information about their inputs. MPC with
information-theoretic security provides the strongest security guarantees and
remains secure even against computationally unbounded adversaries.
Perfectly-secure MPC protocols is a class of information-theoretically secure
MPC protocols, which provides all the security guarantees in an error-free
fashion. The focus of this work is perfectly-secure MPC. Known protocols are
designed assuming either a synchronous or asynchronous communication network.
It is well known that perfectly-secure synchronous MPC protocol is possible as
long as adversary can corrupt any $t_s < n/3$ parties. On the other hand,
perfectly-secure asynchronous MPC protocol can tolerate up to $t_a < n/4$
corrupt parties. A natural question is does there exist a single MPC protocol
for the setting where the parties are not aware of the exact network type and
which can tolerate up to $t_s < n/3$ corruptions in a synchronous network and
up to $t_a < n/4$ corruptions in an asynchronous network. We design such a
best-of-both-worlds perfectly-secure MPC protocol, provided $3t_s + t_a < n$
holds.
  For designing our protocol, we design two important building blocks, which
are of independent interest. The first building block is a best-of-both-worlds
Byzantine agreement (BA) protocol tolerating $t < n/3$ corruptions and which
remains secure, both in a synchronous as well as asynchronous network. The
second building block is a polynomial-based best-of-both-worlds verifiable
secret-sharing (VSS) protocol, which can tolerate up to $t_s$ and $t_a$
corruptions in a synchronous and in an asynchronous network respectively.

coding model (BCM), in which an unknown measure is assumed to belong to the set
of Wasserstein-2 barycenters of a finite set of known measures. Estimating a
measure under this model is equivalent to estimating the unknown barycentric
coordinates. We provide novel geometrical, statistical, and computational
insights for measure estimation under the BCM, consisting of three main
results. Our first main result leverages the Riemannian geometry of
Wasserstein-2 space to provide a procedure for recovering the barycentric
coordinates as the solution to a quadratic optimization problem assuming access
to the true reference measures. The essential geometric insight is that the
parameters of this quadratic problem are determined by inner products between
the optimal displacement maps from the given measure to the reference measures
defining the BCM. Our second main result then establishes an algorithm for
solving for the coordinates in the BCM when all the measures are observed
empirically via i.i.d. samples. We prove precise rates of convergence for this
algorithm -- determined by the smoothness of the underlying measures and their
dimensionality -- thereby guaranteeing its statistical consistency. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of the BCM and associated estimation procedures in
three application areas: (i) covariance estimation for Gaussian measures; (ii)
image processing; and (iii) natural language processing.

stellar radio astronomy as it explicitly ties the radio emission to the coronal
heating mechanisms. The relationship extends from microflares on the Sun to the
coronae of the most active stars suggesting that active coronae are heated by a
flare-like process (Benz & G\""udel 1994). The relationship is thought to
originate from a consistent partition of the available flare energy into
relativistic charges, that emit in the radio-band via the incoherent
gyrosynchrotron mechanism, and heating of the bulk coronal plasma, that emits
in the X-ray band via the Bremsstrahlung mechanism. Consequently, coherent
emission from stellar and sub-stellar objects is not expected to adhere to this
empirical relationship, as is observed in ultracool dwarf stars and brown
dwarfs. Here we report a population of radio-detected chromospherically active
stars that surprisingly follows the G\""udel-Benz relationship despite their
radio emission being classified as coherent emission by virtue of its high
circularly polarised fraction and high brightness temperature. Our results

classification tasks. In order to apply linear regression to classification
tasks, a technique for relaxing regression targets was proposed. However,
methods based on this technique ignore the pressure on a single transformation
matrix due to the complex information contained in the data. A single
transformation matrix in this case is too strict to provide a flexible
projection, thus it is necessary to adopt relaxation on transformation matrix.
This paper proposes a double transformation matrices learning method based on
latent low-rank feature extraction. The core idea is to use double
transformation matrices for relaxation, and jointly projecting the learned
principal and salient features from two directions into the label space, which
can share the pressure of a single transformation matrix. Firstly, the low-rank
features are learned by the latent low rank representation (LatLRR) method
which processes the original data from two directions. In this process, sparse
noise is also separated, which alleviates its interference on projection
learning to some extent. Then, two transformation matrices are introduced to
process the two features separately, and the information useful for the
classification is extracted. Finally, the two transformation matrices can be
easily obtained by alternate optimization methods. Through such processing,
even when a large amount of redundant information is contained in samples, our
method can also obtain projection results that are easy to classify.
Experiments on multiple data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
for classification, especially for complex scenarios.

$D$ denotes the planar domain which is bounded by some closed connected curve
$S$. The quantization scheme of this dynamical system is based on the approach
proposed by the author earlier. As result, we find the discrete values
$\Gamma_n$ for circulation $\Gamma$.
  In contrast to the traditional approach, where such quantities are usually
postulated, the values $\Gamma_n$ are deduced rigorously as the consequence of
the conventional scheme of quantum theory. The model demonstrates the splitting
of levels also. In particular, the levels correction values depend on the
domain $V$: both the cylinder height $L$ and the form of the curve $S$ affect
the final formula for the quantities $\Gamma_n$. Moreover, we prove that the
basic circulation levels demonstrate a ""fine structure"". These anomalous terms,
which are proportional to the value $\hbar^2$, are calculated in the article as
well.
  The conclusions are compared with some results of numerical simulations by
other authors.

Here we formulate anomaly detection as hypothesis testing where the anomaly is
defined through the alternative hypothesis. Consequently, hypothesis testing
algorithms can detect faults in real-world systems such as robots, weather,
energy systems, and stock markets. Although recent works achieved
state-of-the-art performances in these tasks with deep learning models, we show
that a careful analysis using hypothesis testing and graphical models can not
only justify the effectiveness of autoencoder models, but also lead to a novel
neural network design, termed DyAD (DYnamical system Anomaly Detection), with
improved performances. We then show that DyAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several existing datasets and a new dataset on battery anomaly
detection in electric vehicles.

We find that the VNCA learns to reconstruct samples well and that despite its

learn to generate a large variety of output from information encoded in a

  Case Study",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Driving safety analysis has recently experienced unprecedented improvements
thanks to technological advances in precise positioning sensors, artificial
intelligence (AI)-based safety features, autonomous driving systems, connected
vehicles, high-throughput computing, and edge computing servers. Particularly,
deep learning (DL) methods empowered volume video processing to extract
safety-related features from massive videos captured by roadside units (RSU).
Safety metrics are commonly used measures to investigate crashes and
near-conflict events. However, these metrics provide limited insight into the
overall network-level traffic management. On the other hand, some safety
assessment efforts are devoted to processing crash reports and identifying
spatial and temporal patterns of crashes that correlate with road geometry,
traffic volume, and weather conditions. This approach relies merely on crash
reports and ignores the rich information of traffic videos that can help
identify the role of safety violations in crashes. To bridge these two
perspectives, we define a new set of network-level safety metrics (NSM) to
assess the overall safety profile of traffic flow by processing imagery taken
by RSU cameras. Our analysis suggests that NSMs show significant statistical
associations with crash rates. This approach is different than simply
generalizing the results of individual crash analyses, since all vehicles
contribute to calculating NSMs, not only the ones involved in crash incidents.
This perspective considers the traffic flow as a complex dynamic system where
actions of some nodes can propagate through the network and influence the crash
risk for other nodes. We also provide a comprehensive review of surrogate
safety metrics (SSM) in the Appendix A.

simulation and transferring those policies to the real world is one of the most
promising approaches towards data-efficient learning in robotics. However, due
to the inevitable reality gap between the simulation and the real world, a
policy learned in the simulation may not always generate a safe behaviour on
the real robot. As a result, during adaptation of the policy in the real world,
the robot may damage itself or cause harm to its surroundings. In this work, we
introduce a novel learning algorithm called SafeAPT that leverages a diverse
repertoire of policies evolved in the simulation and transfers the most
promising safe policy to the real robot through episodic interaction. To
achieve this, SafeAPT iteratively learns a probabilistic reward model as well
as a safety model using real-world observations combined with simulated
experiences as priors. Then, it performs Bayesian optimization on the
repertoire with the reward model while maintaining the specified safety
constraint using the safety model. SafeAPT allows a robot to adapt to a wide
range of goals safely with the same repertoire of policies evolved in the
simulation. We compare SafeAPT with several baselines, both in simulated and
real robotic experiments and show that SafeAPT finds high-performance policies
within a few minutes in the real world while minimizing safety violations
during the interactions.

the multiscale and nonequilibrium nature inherent in these flows. To
effectively deal with such flows, a novel particle particle hybrid scheme
combining the stochastic particle Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) method with
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) was developed recently, but only for
monatomic gases [Fei et. al., J. Comput. Phys. 2021]. Here this work is
extended to the particle-particle hybrid method for polyatomic gases. In the
near continuum regime, employing the Ellipsoidal Statistical BGK model proposed
by Y. Dauvois, et. al. [Eur. J. Mech. B Fluids, 2021] with discrete levels of
vibrational energy, the stochastic particle BGK method is first established
following the idea of the unified stochastic particle BGK (USPBGK) scheme. In
the fluid limit, it has been proven to be of second order temporal and spatial
accuracy. Then, the USPBGK scheme with rotational and vibrational energies is
combined with DSMC to construct a hybrid method for polyatomic gases. The
present hybrid scheme is validated with numerical tests of homogenous
relaxation, 1D shock structure and 2D hypersonic flows past a wedge and a
cylinder. Compared to traditional stochastic particle methods, the proposed
hybrid method can achieve higher accuracy at a much lower computational cost.
Therefore, it is a more efficient tool to study multiscale hypersonic flows.

furthermore assume an independence of the yield function to hydrostatic
pressure of the yield function. Leveraging the advancement in statistical
modeling we describe and apply a machine learning framework for predicting
macroscopic yield as a function of crystallographic texture. The convexity of
the data-driven yield function is guaranteed by using partially input convex

Euler-Poisson equations, when the doping profile is supersonic, the existence
of steady transonic shock solutions and C-smooth steady transonic solutions for
Euler-Poisson Equations were established in [27] and [41], respectively. In
this paper we further study the nonlinear structural stability and the linear
dynamic instability of these steady transonic solutions. When the C^1-smooth
transonic steady-states pass through the sonic line, they produce singularities
for the system, and cause some essential difficulty in the proof of structural
stability. For any relaxation time, by means of elaborate singularity analysis,
we first investigate the structural stability of the C^1-smooth transonic
steady-states, once the perturbations of the initial data and the doping
profiles are small enough. Moreover, when the relaxation time is large enough,
under the condition that the electric field is positive at the shock location,
we prove that the transonic shock steady-states are structurally stable with
respect to small perturbations of the supersonic doping profile. Furthermore,
we show the linearly dynamic instability for these transonic shock
steady-states provided that the electric field is suitable negative. The proofs
for the structural stability results are based on singularity analysis, a
monotonicity argument on the shock position and the downstream density, and the
stability analysis of supersonic and subsonic solutions. The linear dynamic
instability of the steady transonic shock for Euler-Poisson equations can be
transformed to the ill-posedness of a free boundary problem for the
Klein-Gordon equation. By using a nontrivial transformation and the shooting
method, we prove that the linearized problem has a transonic shock solution
