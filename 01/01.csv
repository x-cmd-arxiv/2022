percolation analysis in a 2D lattice system. In our approach, we develop an
algorithm based on the linked-list data structure and the members of a cluster
are nodes of a path. This path is mapped to a linked-list. This approach
facilitates unique cluster labeling in a lattice with a single scan. We use the
algorithm to determine the critical exponent in the quench dynamics from Mott
Insulator to superfluid phase of bosons in 2D square optical lattices. The
result obtained are consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We also employ
the algorithm to compute correlation lengths using definitions based on
percolation theory. And, use it to identify the quantum critical point of the
Bose Glass to superfluid transition in the disordered 2D square optical
lattices. In addition, we also compute the critical exponent of the transition.

  Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (2021)",,,,"hep-lat cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A trivializing map is a field transformation whose Jacobian determinant
exactly cancels the interaction terms in the action, providing a representation
of the theory in terms of a deterministic transformation of a distribution from
which sampling is trivial. Recently, a proof-of-principle study by Albergo,
Kanwar and Shanahan [arXiv:1904.12072] demonstrated that approximations of
trivializing maps can be `machine-learned' by a class of invertible,
differentiable neural models called \textit{normalizing flows}. By ensuring
that the Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently, asymptotically exact
sampling from the theory of interest can be performed by drawing samples from a
simple distribution and passing them through the network. From a theoretical
perspective, this approach has the potential to become more efficient than
traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, where
autocorrelations severely diminish the sampling efficiency as one approaches
the continuum limit. A major caveat is that it is not yet understood how the
size of models and the cost of training them is expected to scale. As a first
step, we have conducted an exploratory scaling study using two-dimensional
$\phi^4$ with up to $20^2$ lattice sites. Although the scope of our study is
limited to a particular model architecture and training algorithm, initial
results paint an interesting picture in which training costs grow very quickly
indeed. We describe a candidate explanation for the poor scaling, and outline
our intentions to clarify the situation in future work.

epidemics. It was used effectively during the Ebola epidemic and successfully
implemented in several parts of the world during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
An important consideration in contact tracing is the budget on the number of
individuals asked to quarantine -- the budget is limited for socioeconomic
reasons. In this paper, we present a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to
formulate the problem of using contact tracing to reduce the size of an
outbreak while asking a limited number of people to quarantine. We formulate
each step of the MDP as a combinatorial problem, MinExposed, which we
demonstrate is NP-Hard; as a result, we develop an LP-based approximation
algorithm. Though this algorithm directly solves MinExposed, it is often
impractical in the real world due to information constraints. To this end, we
develop a greedy approach based on insights from the analysis of the previous
algorithm, which we show is more interpretable. A key feature of the greedy
algorithm is that it does not need complete information of the underlying
social contact network. This makes the heuristic implementable in practice and
is an important consideration. Finally, we carry out experiments on simulations
of the MDP run on real-world networks, and show how the algorithms can help in
bending the epidemic curve while limiting the number of isolated individuals.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the greedy algorithm and its variants
are especially effective, robust, and practical in a variety of realistic
scenarios, such as when the contact graph and specific transmission
probabilities are not known. All code can be found in our GitHub repository:

which could host strain-induced three-dimensional flat bands at the Fermi level
without requiring doping, when fabricated, for instance, as core-shell
nanowires. In contrast, HgTe/HgSe short-period superlattices are found to
harbor a rich phase diagram with a plethora of topological phases. Notably, the
unstrained superlattice realizes an ideal Weyl semimetal with Weyl points
situated at the Fermi level. A small-gap topological insulator with multiple
band inversions can be obtained by tuning the volume: under compressive
uniaxial strain, the material transitions sequentially into a Dirac semimetal
to a nodal-line semimetal, and finally into a topological insulator with a
single band inversion.

with a quantum resource. In this article we study the problem of revocation of
quantum secret shared by the dealer with two shareholders in a three party
scenario. In the existing secret sharing protocols there are no means by which
the dealer can retrieve back the secret once he/she finds all the share holders
to be semi-honest. In this work, we are not dealing with shareholders who are
dishonest. We state clearly that in our quantum secret sharing protocol, we
explicitly deal with shareholders who are semi-honest and not dishonest. Our
protocol makes a significant advancement in solving this problem by designing
strategy in bringing back the secret in the worst possible situation when all
the shareholders/receivers are semi-honest. In our proposed strategy the dealer
also possesses a quantum share of the secret which empowers the dealer to bring
back the secret even after sharing is done. However the protocol along with the
revocation process also ensures the normal reconstruction at the share holder's
location when they are honest. This advantage comes with the expense of extra
one qubit on dealer's side and consequently we require a four qubit resource to
start with for 1-dealer and 2-share holder's scenario. Here in this article we
not only give the description of our protocol but also give an example where
our protocol is working with the help of a four qubit entangled state. We also
explicitly found out the range of parameter for the input state for which the
protocol will be successful.

Here we show that our Solar System may have formed from rings of planetesimals

gaseous disk phase assuming the existence of pressure bumps near the silicate
sublimation line (at $T \sim$1400~K), water snowline (at $T \sim$170~K), and
CO-snowline (at $T \sim$30~K). Our simulations show that dust piles up at the
bumps and forms up to three rings of planetesimals: a narrow ring near 1~au, a
wide ring between $\sim$3-4~au and $\sim$10-20~au, and a distant ring between
$\sim$20~au and $\sim$45~au. We use a series of simulations to follow the
evolution of the innermost ring and show how it can explain the orbital
structure of the inner Solar System and provides a framework to explain the
origins of isotopic signatures of Earth, Mars and different classes of
meteorites. The central ring contains enough mass to explain the rapid growth
of the giant planets' cores. The outermost ring is consistent with dynamical
models of Solar System evolution proposing that the early Solar System had a

the Gramian constraint is implemented in the original space, and the nonlinear

operations with the matrices can be implemented efficiently using two
dimensional fast Fourier transforms. This makes it feasible to solve for large

to solve the nonlinear problem by applying iterative methods that rely only on
matrix vector multiplications. As such, the use of the regularized reweighted

also extend the proposed method to learn mixture of MNL. We demonstrate that

Consequently, in such settings, these NNs lose their ability to benefit from

optimizing wide ReLU neural networks with at least one hidden layer using
L2-regularization on the parameters promotes multi-task learning due to
representation-learning - also in the limiting regime where the network width

real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are
traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their
increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration,
substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle
this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters.
State-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform
demonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However,
they have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close
the gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general
pruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural
networks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the
network sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization
techniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the
network weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in
the majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work
utilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity.
  Moreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into
any existing Offline-RL algorithms without changing the learning objective.

invisible (or faded) appearance properties in complex natural materials. Our
algorithm addresses the technical challenge of transferring appearance
properties from one object to another of the same material when both objects
have intricate, noncorresponding color patterns. Eggshells, exoskeletons, and
minerals, for example, have patterns composed of highly randomized layers of
organic and inorganic compounds. These materials pose a challenge as the
distribution of compounds that determine surface color changes from object to
object and within local pattern regions. Our solution adapts appearance
observations from a material property distribution in an exemplar to the
material property distribution of a target object to reconstruct its unknown
appearance. We use measured reflectance in 3-D bispectral textures to record
changing material property distributions. Our novel implementation of spherical
harmonics uses principles from chemistry and biology to learn relationships
between color (hue and saturation) and material composition and concentration
in an exemplar. The encoded relationships are transformed to the property
distribution of a target for color recovery and material assignment.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods show that we replicate color
patterns more accurately than methods that only rely on shape correspondences
and coarse-level perceptual differences. We demonstrate applications of our
work for reconstructing color in extinct fossils, restoring faded artifacts and
generating synthetic textures.

leading to a susy vacua of the resolved conifold. It possesses the non-Abelian
global symmetry SU(2)xSU(2). A non-Abelian T-duality can be constructed which
can be described by gauging the global non-Abelian symmetry. This leads to a
dual action, in terms of the dual model Kaehler and superpotential terms, which
include twisted chiral superfields dependence. Comparing the effective
potentials for the U(1) fields on the original and the dual models we determine
the instanton corrections to the dual action. We obtain the supersymmetry vacua
solution of the dual model, in three cases: first in an Abelian direction
inside SU(2)xSU(2), then for an Abelian direction considering instanton
corrections and finally for a semi-chiral non Abelian vector superfield. The
dual geometry for all of these cases (SUSY vacua space) is given by T5xR.
However the instanton corrections restrict the Fayet-Iliopoulos term to be zero
and fix the theta-term, which implies that the duality is established for the
case of the singular conifold. We also discuss the U(1)A R-symmetry in the dual
model and its possible role.

$\bep_j$ are noises as random elements in $\scrH$ from a general distribution.
We study the estimation of $f(\btheta)$ for a given functional
$f:\scrH\rightarrow \RR$ based on $\bx_j$'s. The key element of our approach is
a new method which we call High-Order Degenerate Statistical Expansion. It
leverages the use of classical multivariate Taylor expansion and degenerate
$U$-statistic and yields an elegant explicit formula. In the univariate case of
$\scrH=\R$, the formula expresses the error of the proposed estimator as a sum
of order $k$ degenerate $U$-products of the noises with coefficient
$f^{(k)}(\btheta)/k!$ and an explicit remainder term in the form of the
Riemann-Liouville integral as in the Taylor expansion around the true
$\btheta$. For general $\scrH$, the formula expresses the estimation error in
terms of the inner product of $f^{(k)}(\btheta)/k!$ and the average of the
tensor products of $k$ noises with distinct indices and a parallel extension of
the remainder term from the univariate case. This makes the proposed method a
natural statistical version of the classical Taylor expansion. The proposed
estimator can be viewed as a jackknife estimator of an ideal degenerate
expansion of $f(\cdot)$ around the true $\btheta$ with the degenerate
$U$-product of the noises, and can be approximated by bootstrap. Thus, the
jackknife, bootstrap and Taylor expansion approaches all converge to the
proposed estimator. We develop risk bounds for the proposed estimator and a
central limit theorem under a second moment condition (even in expansions of
higher than the second order). We apply this new method to generalize several
existing results with smooth and nonsmooth $f$ to universal $\bep_j$'s with

boundary conditions for topological defects of the 7d bulk TQFT. A
codimension-two defect carrying a non-trivial defect group acts as an irregular

determine the defect groups associated to large classes of both conformal and
non-conformal irregular punctures. Along the way, we discover many new classes
of irregular punctures. A key role in the analysis of defect groups is played
by two different geometric descriptions of the punctures in Type IIB string
theory: one provided by isolated hypersurface singularities in Calabi-Yau
threefolds, and the other provided by ALE fibrations with monodromies.

G34.26$+$0.15, which increases the number of high-mass star-forming regions

months) at Effelsberg shows that the intensity of the (9,6) maser in
G34.26$+$0.15 is decreasing, while the Cep A maser remains stable. Compared to
the Effelsberg data and assuming linear variations between the epochs of
observation, the JVLA data indicate no missing flux. This suggests that the
NH$_3$ (9,6) emission arises from single compact emission regions that are not
resolved by the interferometric measurements. As JVLA imaging shows, the
NH$_{3}$ (9,6) emission in Cep A originates from a sub-arcsecond sized region,
slightly to the west of the peak position of the 1.36\,cm continuum object,
HW2. In G34.26$+$0.15, three NH$_{3}$ (9,6) maser spots are observed: one is
close to the head of the cometary ultracompact \h2 region C and the other two
are emitted from a compact region to the west of the hypercompact \h2 region A.
The newly found (9,6) masers appear to be related to outflows. Higher angular
resolution of JVLA and VLBI observations are needed to provide more accurate

above approximately $50-70$ M$_\odot$, the lower limit of the pair-instability
mass gap. However, recent LIGO/Virgo detections indicate the existence of BHs
with masses at and above this threshold. We suggest that massive BHs, including
intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), can form in galactic nuclei through
collisions between stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding main-sequence
stars. Considering dynamical processes such as collisions, mass segregation,
and relaxation, we find that this channel can be quite efficient, forming IMBHs
as massive as $10^4$ M$_\odot$. This upper limit assumes that (1) the BHs
accrete a substantial fraction of the stellar mass captured during each
collision and (2) that the rate at which new stars are introduced into the
region near the SMBH is high enough to offset depletion by stellar disruptions
and star-star collisions. We discuss deviations from these key assumptions in
the text. Our results suggest that BHs in the pair-instability mass gap and
IMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic centers. This formation channel has
implications for observations. Collisions between stars and BHs can produce
electromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal
disruption events. Additionally, formed through this channel, both black holes
in the mass gap and IMBHs can merge with the supermassive black hole at the
center of a galactic nucleus through gravitational waves. These gravitational
wave events are extreme and intermediate mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs,
respectively).

various massive binary BH population models, featuring competing prescriptions
for the Delays between galaxy and BH mergers, for the impact of supernova
feedback on massive BH growth, and for the initial population of high redshift
BH seeds (light versus heavy seeds). For each of these scenarios, we compute
the average number of expected events for precision BH spectroscopy using a
Fisher-matrix analysis. We find that, for any heavy seed scenario, LISA will
measure the dominant mode frequency within ${\cal O}(0.1) \%$ relative
uncertainty and will estimate at least 3 independent QNM parameters within $1
\%$ error. The most optimistic heavy seed scenarios produce $\mathcal{O}(100)$
events with $1 \%$ measurability for 3 or more QNM quantities during LISA's
operational time. On the other hand, light seed scenarios produce lighter
merger remnants, which ring at frequencies higher than LISA's sensitivity.
Interestingly, the light seed models give rise to a fraction of mergers in the

become more important to understand in detail the physics of strongly
gravitating horizonless objects. If the objects identified in the observations
are indeed horizonless and ultracompact, high curvature effects may come into
play, and their explorations may be intimately related to new physics beyond
General Relativity (GR). In this paper, we revisit the concept of statistical
thermodynamics in curved spacetime, focusing on self-gravitating compact
systems without event horizons. Differently from the previous studies in this
context, we develop a generic framework with no explicit dependence on the
gravitational field equations, which is then applicable to a general theory of
gravity. Defining the global variables directly from the local counterparts,
the conventional thermodynamics follows for a generic curved spacetime. The key
step is the appropriate identification of thermodynamic volume to ensure the
first law of thermodynamics, which is in general different from the geometric

gas in GR, where the connection to previous studies becomes clear. We also
discuss 2-2-holes in quadratic gravity, a novel example of black hole mimickers
that features super-Planckian curvatures in the interior. When the physical
mass is treated as the total internal energy, interesting connections to black
hole thermodynamics emerge. We find universal high curvature effects in

observationally, and indeed it may not be possible to do so. However,
alternatives may be established by the observation of gravitational wave echoes
that probe possible near-horizon structure. These echoes are proposed to be
generated in exotic compact objects that are horizonless and feature a
partially reflecting ""wall"" inside their light rings, creating a cavity in
which gravitational perturbations may echo, while leaking out through the
angular momentum barrier with each pass. The characteristic signature of echoes
is a comb of nearly evenly spaced spectral resonances. While approximately
true, deviations from this simple picture can lead to severe observational
signal losses. In this paper, we explore such subtleties with the latest
results for echo sourcing and geometry. A physically motivated echo model is
then developed as a sum over Lorentzian spectral lines, parametrized by
functions of the horizon frame frequency and the size of the cavity. Our final
spectrum is a function of only the mass and spin of the black hole, as well as
the UV scale of the near-horizon physics. We then apply this model in a search
for echoes in the gravitational wave event with the loudest ringdown signal in
LIGO/Virgo, i.e. GW190521. We interpret our findings as a measurement of the
fractional energy in post-merger echoes equal to $E_{echoes} / E_{GR} = 8.9 \pm
4.5\%$, where the uncertainty range represents the 90% credible region. The
robustness of this result is tested against noise backgrounds and simulated
injections, and we find that a signal persists through modifications to the
model and changes in the data search.

threshold autoregressive (TAR) models. It is well-known that classic tests
based on asymptotic theory tend to be oversized in the case of small, or even
moderate sample sizes, or when the estimated parameters indicate
non-stationarity, as often witnessed in the analysis of financial or climate
data. To address the issue we propose a supremum Lagrange Multiplier test
statistic (sLMb), where the null hypothesis specifies a linear autoregressive
(AR) model against the alternative of a TAR model. We consider a recursive
bootstrap applied to the sLMb statistic and establish its validity. This result
is new, and requires the proof of non-standard results for bootstrap analysis
in time series models; this includes a uniform bootstrap law of large numbers
and a bootstrap functional central limit theorem. These new results can also be
used as a general theoretical framework that can be adapted to other
situations, such as regime-switching processes with exogenous threshold
variables, or testing for structural breaks. The Monte Carlo evidence shows
that the bootstrap test has correct empirical size even for small samples, and
also no loss of empirical power when compared to the asymptotic test. Moreover,
its performance is not affected if the order of the autoregression is estimated
based on information criteria. Finally, we analyse a panel of short time series

number and separation distance. Three distinct vortex patterns are identified
in the Strohual number-separation distance phase maps, which include separated
wake, merged wake, and transitional-merged wake. Furthermore, a novel model is
introduced based on fundamental flow variables including velocity, location,
and circulation of dipole structures to quantitatively distinguish vortex
patterns in the wake. The physical mechanism of wake merging process is also
elucidated. When an oscillating foil experiences the jet deflection phenomenon,
secondary structures shed from the primary street traverse in the other
direction by making an angle with its parent vortex street. For parallel foils,
secondary structures from the vortex street of the lower foil interact with the
primary vortex street of the upper foil under certain kinematic conditions.
This interaction triggers the wake merging process by influencing circulation
of coherent structures in the upper part of the wake. It is unveiled that
merging of the wakes leads to enhancements in propulsive efficiency by
increasing thrust generation without a significant alteration in power
requirements. These are attributed to the formation of a high-momentum jet by
the merged vortex street, which possesses significantly larger circulation due
to the amalgamation of the vortices, and major alterations in the evolution of
leading edge vortices. Thus, flow physics that are thoroughly explored here are
crucial in providing novel insights for future development of flow control
techniques for efficient designs of bio-inspired underwater propulsors.

torques between interior regions, and viscous and electromagnetic (EM) coupling
at the boundaries of the fluid core. We show that the coupling between
Mercury's interior regions is sufficiently strong that the obliquity of the
mantle spin axis deviates from that of a rigid planet by no more than 0.01
arcmin. The mantle obliquity decreases with increasing inner core size, but the
change between a large and no inner core is limited to 0.015 arcmin. EM
coupling is stronger than viscous coupling at the inner core boundary and, if
the core magnetic field strength is above 0.3 mT, locks the fluid and solid
cores into a common precession motion. Because of the strong gravitational
coupling between the mantle and inner core, the larger the inner core is, the
more this co-precessing core is brought into an alignment with the mantle, and
the more the obliquity of the polar moment of inertia approaches that expected
for a rigid planet. The misalignment between the polar moment of inertia and
mantle spin axis increases with inner core size, but is limited to 0.007
arcmin. Our results imply that the measured obliquities of the mantle spin axis

contexts and learn continuously. Although standard deep learning systems
achieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in
dynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can
interfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired
architectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the
biophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable
networks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific
manner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel

task-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning
environment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation
tasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's
prediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks
demonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks,
allowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.
Our neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has
achieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning

  We prove that cutting $M$ along a disk resulting in a $3$-manifold $M'$
yields a homomorphism $S_n(M)\to S_n(M')$. That result allows to analyze the
skein modules of $3$-manifolds through the skein modules of their pieces.
  The theory of stated skein modules is particularly rich for thickened
surfaces $M=\Sigma \times (-1,1),$ in whose case, $S_n(M)$ is an algebra,
denoted by $S_n(\Sigma).$ We prove that the skein algebra of the ideal bigon is
$O_q(SL(n))$ and that it provides simple geometric interpretations of the
product, coproduct, counit, the antipode, and the cobraided structure on
$O_q(SL(n)).$
  Additionally, we show that a splitting of a thickened bigon near a marking
defines a $O_q(SL(n))$-comodule structure on $S_n(M),$ or dually, an
$U_q(sl_n)$-module structure. Furthermore, we show that the skein algebra of
surfaces $\Sigma_1, \Sigma_2$ glued along two sides of a triangle is isomorphic
with the braided tensor product $S_n(\Sigma_1)\underline{\otimes}
S_n(\Sigma_2)$ of Majid. These results allow for a geometric interpretation of
further concepts in the theory of quantum groups, for example, of the braided
products and of Majid's transmutation operation.
  We prove that the factorization homology of surfaces with coefficients in
$Rep\, U_q(sl_n)$ is equivalent to the category of left modules over
$S_n(\Sigma)$. We also discuss the relation with the quantum moduli spaces of
Alekseev-Schomerus.
  Finally, we show that for surfaces $\Sigma$ with boundary, $S_n(\Sigma)$ is a
free module with a basis induced from the Kashiwara-Lusztig canonical bases.

pose fundamental limits to accessible spatiotemporal information despite
impressive tools such as SIM, PALM/STORM, and STED microscopy. How to combat
this challenge ideally has been an open question for decades. Inspired by a
""virtual gain"" technique to compensate losses in metamaterials, ""active
convolved illumination"" has been recently proposed to significantly improve the
signal-to-noise ratio, hence data acquisition. In this technique, the light
pattern of the object is superimposed with a correlated auxiliary pattern, the
function of which is to reverse the adverse effect of noise and random
distortion based on their spectral characteristics. Despite enormous
implications in statistics, an experimental realization of this novel technique
has been lacking to date. Here, we present the first experimental
demonstration. We find that the active convolved illumination does not only
boost the resolution limit and image contrast, but also the resistance to pixel
saturation. The results confirm the previous theories and opens up new horizons
in a wide range of disciplines from atmospheric sciences, seismology, biology,
statistical learning, and information processing to quantum noise beyond the
fundamental boundaries.

date, GW190521 deserves special attention. The exceptionally loud ringdown of
this merger makes it an ideal candidate to search for gravitational wave
echoes, a proposed smoking gun for the quantum structure of black hole
horizons. We perform an unprecedented multi-pronged search for echoes via two
well-established and independent pipelines: a template-based search for
stimulated emission of Hawking radiation, or Boltzmann echoes, and the
model-agnostic coherent WaveBurst (cWB) search. Stimulated Hawking radiation
from the merger is expected to lead to post-merger echoes at horizon mode
frequency of $\sim50$ Hz (for quadrupolar gravitational radiation), repeating
at intervals of $\sim1$ second, due to partial reflection off Planckian quantum
structure of the horizon. A careful analysis using dynamic nested sampling
yields a Bayesian evidence of $8^{+4}_{-2}$ (90\% confidence level) for this
signal following GW190521, carrying an excess of $6^{+10}_{-5}\%$ in
gravitational wave energy, relative to the main event (consistent with the
predicted amplitude of Boltzmann echoes). The ""look-elsewhere"" effect is
estimated by using General Relativity (plus Boltzmann echoes) injections in
real data, around the event, giving a false (true) positive detection
probability for higher Bayes factors of $1.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\%$ ($35\pm7\%$).
Similarly, the reconstructed waveform of the first echo in cWB carries an
energy excess of $13^{+16}_{-7}\%$. While the current evidence for stimulated
Hawking radiation does not reach the gold standard of $5\sigma$ (or p-value
$<3\times10^{-7}$), our findings are in line with expectations for stimulated
Hawking radiation at current detector sensitivities. The next generation of
gravitational wave observatories can thus draw a definitive conclusion on the
quantum nature of black hole horizons.

fundamental interactions. A Neutron Star can capture Dark Matter via
scattering. As a result of the scattering, Dark Matter kinetic energy is
transferred to the star. An observational consequence of this can be the
warming of old neutron stars to near-infrared temperatures. Different
approximations or simplifications have been applied to previous analyses of the
capture process. In this article, we summarise a significantly improved
treatment of Dark Matter capture, which properly accounts for all relevant
physical effects over a wide range of Dark Matter masses. Among them are
gravitational focusing, a fully relativistic scattering treatment, Pauli
blocking, neutron star opacity and multiple scattering effects. This paper
cites general expressions that allow the capture rate to be computed
numerically, and simplified expressions for particular types of interactions or
mass regimes, which greatly increase the efficiency of computation. As a result
of our method, we are able to model the scattering of Dark Matter from any
neutron star constituent as well as the capture of Dark Matter in other compact
objects. Our results are applied to scattering of Dark Matter from neutrons,
protons, leptons and exotic baryons.

approach this problem by addressing the complexity of the models -- via model
compression, pruning and quantization -- or compressing the input. In this
paper, we propose a different perspective when addressing the performance
challenges. Croesus is a multi-stage approach to edge-cloud systems that
provides the ability to find the balance between accuracy and performance.
Croesus consists of two stages (that can be generalized to multiple stages): an
initial and a final stage. The initial stage performs the computation in
real-time using approximate/best-effort computation at the edge. The final
stage performs the full computation at the cloud, and uses the results to
correct any errors made at the initial stage. In this paper, we demonstrate the
implications of such an approach on a video analytics use-case and show how
multi-stage processing yields a better balance between accuracy and

which results in better attack performance at the expense of coordination
between different locations. We numerically evaluate the performance of the
proposed attack constructions on IEEE test systems and show that it is feasible
to construct stealth attacks that generate significant disruption with a low
number of compromised sensors.

Einstein-aether formalism to study photon-like particles. To do so, we consider
the system within the canonical ensemble formalism in order to derive the
following thermodynamic state quantities: spectral radiance, Helmholtz free

correction to the \textit{Stefan--Boltzmann} law and the equation of states are

i.e., $s=0,p=0$; $s=1,p=1$; $s=2,p=1$. In the first one, the results are
derived \textit{numerically}. Nevertheless, for the rest of the cases, all the
calculations are accomplished \textit{analytically} showing explicitly the
dependence of the scale factor $C(\eta)$ and the Riemann zeta function

inflationary era ($T=10^{13}$ GeV), the electroweak epoch ($T=10^{3}$ GeV) and
the cosmic microwave background ($T=10^{-13}$ GeV).

thus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve
worst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable for the training

of group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose
BARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information
to improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group
labels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a
robust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds
for our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, which scale with
respect to both the total number of training points and the number of training
points with group labels. Empirically, our method outperforms the baselines
that do not use group information, even when only 1-33% of points have group
labels. We provide ablation studies to support the robustness and extensibility
of our framework.

unreliable news, they could potentially contribute to societal issues like
rising political polarization. This concern is central to the echo chamber and
filter bubble debates, which critique the roles that user choice and
algorithmic curation play in guiding users to different online information
sources. These roles can be measured in terms of exposure, the URLs seen while
using an online platform, and engagement, the URLs selected while on that
platform or browsing the web more generally. However, due to the challenges of
obtaining ecologically valid exposure data--what real users saw during their
regular platform use--studies in this vein often only examine engagement data,
or estimate exposure via simulated behavior or inference. Despite their
centrality to the contemporary information ecosystem, few such studies have
focused on web search, and even fewer have examined both exposure and
engagement on any platform. To address these gaps, we conducted a two-wave
study pairing surveys with ecologically valid measures of exposure and
engagement on Google Search during the 2018 and 2020 US elections. We found
that participants' partisan identification had a small and inconsistent
relationship with the amount of partisan and unreliable news they were exposed
to on Google Search, a more consistent relationship with the search results
they chose to follow, and the most consistent relationship with their overall
engagement. That is, compared to the news sources our participants were exposed
to on Google Search, we found more identity-congruent and unreliable news
sources in their engagement choices, both within Google Search and overall.
These results suggest that exposure and engagement with partisan or unreliable
news on Google Search are not primarily driven by algorithmic curation, but by
users' own choices.

find that the more similar the target language is to English, the greater the
translation performance. In addition, we study the impact of providing NMT

that, for Transformer-based models, the more dissimilar the target language is

Crank--Nicolson scheme in velocity space and a finite-difference Euler scheme
in configuration space. We initialize our model with isotropic electron
distribution functions and calculate the kinetic expansion at heliocentric
distances from 5 to 20 solar radii. In our kinetic model, the electrons evolve
mainly through the combination of the ballistic particle streaming, the
magnetic mirror force, and the electric field. By applying fits to our
numerical results, we quantify the parameters of the electron strahl and core
part of the electron velocity distributions. The strahl fit parameters show
that the density of the electron strahl is around 7% of the total electron
density at a distance of 20 solar radii, the strahl bulk velocity and strahl
temperature parallel to the background magnetic field stay approximately
constant beyond a distance of 15 solar radii, and $\beta_{\parallel s}$ (i.e.,
the ratio between strahl parallel thermal pressure to the magnetic pressure) is
approximately constant with heliocentric distance at a value of about 0.02. We
compare our results with data measured by Parker Solar Probe. Furthermore, we
provide theoretical evidence that the electron strahl is not scattered by the
oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability in the near-Sun environment.

problem that has impacted different aspects of our lives, including politics

that automates the detection of fake news. Natural human behavior is to
cross-check new information with reliable sources. We use Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and build a machine learning (ML) model that automates the
process of cross-checking new information with a set of predefined reliable
sources. We implement this for Twitter and build a model that flags fake
tweets. Specifically, for a given tweet, we use its text to find relevant news
from reliable news agencies. We then train a Random Forest model that checks if
the textual content of the tweet is aligned with the trusted news. If it is
not, the tweet is classified as fake. This approach can be generally applied to
any kind of information and is not limited to a specific news story or a
category of information. Our implementation of this approach gives a $70\%$
accuracy which outperforms other generic fake-news classification models. These
results pave the way towards a more sensible and natural approach to fake news
detection.

the crystalline (\textit{c}-Bi) had not been found to do so: we computer
calculated their electronic properties and found that \textit{a}-Bi has a
larger electron density of states, eDoS, at the Fermi surface than

investigate what happens to crystalline (Wyckoff structure) and amorphous Bi
when pressures below the atmospheric are applied (expansion). Here we show that
when expanded, \textit{c}-Bi becomes more metallic, since the eDoS increases
when the volume increases for the Wyckoff structure, while the amorphous eDoS
decreases. If the crystalline structure is maintained its $T_c$ would rise
under expansion, whereas it would diminish for the \textit{a}-Bi. Expansion can
be obtained in the laboratory by chemically etching Bi-based alloys, a process

PT-symmetries also play a key role in the reality of conserved charges here. We
then extend our investigations to explore degenerate multi-soliton solutions

time-delays from degenerate soliton solution scattering are time-dependent,
unlike the non-degenerate multi-soliton solutions, and provide a universal

exploit gauge equivalence between the Hirota system with continuous Heisenberg

place trend filtering, which was originally a nonparametric regression problem,
in a parametric setting to provide a posterior median fit along with credible

the application of the gradient-based MCMC sampler Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The

this issue, we present a Dual-Semi RGB-D Salient Object Detection Network

detection. We first devise a depth decoupling convolutional neural network
(DDCNN), which contains a depth estimation branch and a saliency detection
branch. The depth estimation branch is trained with RGB-D images and then used
to estimate the pseudo depth maps for all unlabeled RGB images to form the
paired data. The saliency detection branch is used to fuse the RGB feature and
depth feature to predict the RGB-D saliency. Then, the whole DDCNN is assigned
as the backbone in a teacher-student framework for semi-supervised learning.
Moreover, we also introduce a consistency loss on the intermediate attention

saliency loss for labeled data. Experimental results on seven widely-used

consumption speeds were measured for three jet-like fuels using a premixed
turbulent Bunsen burner. The burner was used to independently control
turbulence intensity, unburned temperature, and equivalence ratio. Each fuel
had similar heat releases (within 2%), laminar flame speeds (within 5-15 %),
and adiabatic flame temperatures. Despite this similarity, for constant Re_D
and turbulence intensity, A2 (i.e., jet-A) has the highest turbulent flame
speeds and remains stable (i.e., without tip quenching) at lower {\phi} than
the other fuels evaluated. In contrast the C1 fuel, which contains no
aromatics, has the slowest turbulent flame speeds and exhibits tip quenching at
higher {\phi} then the other fuels. C1 was the most sensitive to the influence
of turbulence, as evidenced by this fuel having the largest ratio of turbulent
to laminar flame speeds. The C1 fuel had the highest stretch sensitivity, in
general, as indicated by calculated Markstein numbers. This work shows that
turbulent flame speeds and tip stability of multi-component large hydrocarbon
fuels can be sensitive to the chemical class of its components. The results
from the current work indicate that caution may be needed when using
alternative or surrogate fuels to replicate conventional fuels, especially if
the alternative fuels are missing chemical classes of fuels that influence
stretch sensitivities.

realize the detection of (both seen and) unseen classes given an unconstrained
test image. In this study, we reveal the core challenges in this research area:
how to synthesize robust region features (for unseen objects) that are as
intra-class diverse and inter-class separable as the real samples, so that
strong unseen object detectors can be trained upon them. To address these
challenges, we build a novel zero-shot object detection framework that contains
an Intra-class Semantic Diverging component and an Inter-class Structure
Preserving component. The former is used to realize the one-to-more mapping to
obtain diverse visual features from each class semantic vector, preventing
miss-classifying the real unseen objects as image backgrounds. While the latter
is used to avoid the synthesized features too scattered to mix up the
inter-class and foreground-background relationship. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive experiments on PASCAL
VOC, COCO, and DIOR datasets are conducted. Notably, our approach achieves the
new state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO and it is the first

Existing approaches typically rely on outside tools to infer visible body
parts, which may be suboptimal in terms of both computational efficiency and
ReID accuracy. In particular, they may fail when facing complex occlusions,
such as those between pedestrians. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a
novel method named Quality-aware Part Models (QPM) for occlusion-robust ReID.
First, we propose to jointly learn part features and predict part quality
scores. As no quality annotation is available, we introduce a strategy that
automatically assigns low scores to occluded body parts, thereby weakening the
impact of occluded body parts on ReID results. Second, based on the predicted
part quality scores, we propose a novel identity-aware spatial attention (ISA)
module. In this module, a coarse identity-aware feature is utilized to
highlight pixels of the target pedestrian, so as to handle the occlusion
between pedestrians. Third, we design an adaptive and efficient approach for
generating global features from common non-occluded regions with respect to
each image pair. This design is crucial, but is often ignored by existing
methods. QPM has three key advantages: 1) it does not rely on any outside tools
in either the training or inference stages; 2) it handles occlusions caused by
both objects and other pedestrians;3) it is highly computationally efficient.
Experimental results on four popular databases for occluded ReID demonstrate
that QPM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant
margins. The code of QPM will be released.

this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a
pre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for
edge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and
challenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful
application of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during
training. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for
choosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the
results of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices

its optical activity in the Deep-UV region. The optical properties such as the
dielectric function, the reflectivity, the absorption, and the optical

localization, so that the Lagrangian multiplier terms are no longer needed,
leading to a relaxed energy function with better convexity. Based on the
relaxed energy function, a RNFNN is implemented with much simpler structure and
faster convergence speed. Furthermore, the RNFNN method is extended to
localization in the presence of transmitter and receiver location errors. It is
shown that the performance of the proposed localization approach achieves the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) within a wider range of signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs). Extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches are
provided, which demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of
performance improvement and computational complexity (or convergence speed).

  Distributed Neural Network with Two Stage Windowing of Short-Term Features",,,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identification of bird species from audio records is one of the challenging
tasks due to the existence of multiple species in the same recording, noise in
the background, and long-term recording. Besides, choosing a proper acoustic
feature from audio recording for bird species classification is another
problem. In this paper, a hybrid method is represented comprising both
traditional signal processing and a deep learning-based approach to classify
bird species from audio recordings of diverse sources and types. Besides, a
detailed study with 34 different features helps to select the proper feature
set for classification and analysis in real-time applications. Moreover, the
proposed deep neural network uses both acoustic and temporal feature learning.
The proposed method starts with detecting voice activity from the raw signal,
followed by extracting short-term features from the processed recording using
50 ms (with 25ms overlapping) time windows. Later, the short-term features are
reshaped using second stage (non-overlapping) windowing to be trained through a
distributed 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that forwards the output
features to a Long and Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network. Then a final dense
layer classifies the bird species. For the 10 class classifier, the highest
accuracy achieved was 90.45\% for a feature set consisting of 13 Mel Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and 12 Chroma Vectors. The corresponding
specificity and AUC scores are 98.94\% and 94.09\%, respectively.

efficient means, compared to qubits, for implementing various information
theoretic tasks. One of the ubiquitous resources in such explorations is
entanglement. Entanglement Monotones (EMs) are of key importance, particularly
for assessing the efficacy of a given entangled state as a resource for
information theoretic tasks. Till date, investigations towards determination of
EMs have focused on providing their tighter lower bounds. There is yet no
general scheme available for direct determination of the EMs. Consequently, an
empirical determination of any EM has not yet been achieved for entangled qudit
states. The present paper fills this gap, both theoretically as well as
experimentally. First, we derive analytical relations between statistical
correlation measures i.e. Mutual Predictability (MP), Mutual Information (MI)
and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and standard EMs i.e. Negativity (N)
and Entanglement of Formation (EOF) in arbitrary dimensions. As a proof of
concept, we then experimentally measure MP, MI and PCC of two-qutrit pure
states and determine their N and EOF using these derived relations. This is a
useful addition to the experimenter's toolkit wherein by using a limited number
of measurements (in this case 1 set of measurements), one can directly measure
the EMs in a bipartite arbitrary dimensional system. We obtain the value of N
for our bipartite qutrit to be 0.907 $\pm$ 0.013 and the EOF to be 1.323 $\pm$
0.022. Since the present scheme enables determination of more than one
entanglement monotone by the same limited number of measurements, we argue that
it can serve as a unique experimental platform for quantitatively comparing and
contrasting the operational implications of entanglement monotones as well as
showing their non-monotonicity for a given bipartire pure qudit state.

less-dissipative energy conversion endowed with instantaneous responsivity

Nevertheless, the small-band-gap material for the low-energy BPVE inevitably

Here, we demonstrate the shift current induced by soft-phonon excitations

smaller than the electronic band gap. At and above room temperature, we observe

Recommender Systems touch and influence more and more people in their daily
lives. In fairness-aware recommendation, most of the existing algorithmic
approaches mainly aim at solving a constrained optimization problem by imposing
a constraint on the level of fairness while optimizing the main recommendation
objective, e.g., CTR. While this alleviates the impact of unfair
recommendations, the expected return of an approach may significantly
compromise the recommendation accuracy due to the inherent trade-off between
fairness and utility. This motivates us to deal with these conflicting
objectives and explore the optimal trade-off between them in recommendation.
One conspicuous approach is to seek a Pareto efficient solution to guarantee
optimal compromises between utility and fairness. Moreover, considering the
needs of real-world e-commerce platforms, it would be more desirable if we can
generalize the whole Pareto Frontier, so that the decision-makers can specify
any preference of one objective over another based on their current business
needs. Therefore, in this work, we propose a fairness-aware recommendation
framework using multi-objective reinforcement learning, called MoFIR, which is
able to learn a single parametric representation for optimal recommendation
policies over the space of all possible preferences. Specially, we modify
traditional DDPG by introducing conditioned network into it, which conditions
the networks directly on these preferences and outputs Q-value-vectors.
Experiments on several real-world recommendation datasets verify the
superiority of our framework on both fairness metrics and recommendation

field equations via a minimal geometric deformation in the context of
self-interacting Brans-Dicke gravity. We introduce an extra source in the
anisotropic fluid distribution to generate new analogs of existing solutions.
The radial metric function is transformed to decouple the field equations into
two sets such that each array corresponds to one source only. The system
corresponding to the original matter distribution is specified by metric
functions of well-behaved solutions. On the other hand, the second set is
closed by imposing constraints on the additional matter source. For this
purpose, we have applied the isotropization condition as well as vanishing
complexity condition on the new source. Smooth matching of interior and
exterior spacetimes at the junction provides values of the unknown constants.
Interesting physical features of corresponding models are checked by employing
the mass and radius of the star PSR J1614-2230. It is concluded that both
extensions yield viable and stable models for certain values of the decoupling
parameter.

the COVID-19 pandemic more recently (2020) has resulted in a change in the
Internet traffic composition. Consequently, an updated microscopic view of
traffic shares is needed to understand how the Internet is evolving to capture
both such shorter- and longer-term events. Toward this end, we observe traffic
composition at a research network in Japan and a Tier-1 ISP in the USA. We
analyze the traffic traces passively captured at two inter-domain links: MAWI
(Japan) and CAIDA (New York-Sao Paulo), which cover 100GB of data for MAWI
traces and 4TB of data for CAIDA traces in total. We begin by studying the
impact of COVID-19 on the MAWI link: We find a substantial increase in the
traffic volume of OpenVPN and rsync, as well as increases in traffic volume
from cloud storage and video conferencing services, which shows that clients
shift to remote work during the pandemic. For traffic traces between March 2018
to December 2018, we find that the use of IPv6 is increasing quickly on the
CAIDA monitor: The IPv6 traffic volume increases from 1.1% in March 2018 to
6.1% in December 2018, while the IPv6 traffic share remains stable in the MAWI
dataset at around 9% of the traffic volume. Among other protocols at the
application layer, 60%-70% of IPv4 traffic on the CAIDA link is HTTP(S)
traffic, out of which two-thirds are encrypted; for the MAWI link, more than
90% of the traffic is Web, of which nearly 75% is encrypted. Compared to
previous studies, this depicts a larger increase in encrypted Web traffic of up
to a 3-to-1 ratio of HTTPS to HTTP. As such, our observations in this study
further reconfirm that traffic shares change with time and can vary greatly
depending on the vantage point studied despite the use of the same generalized
methodology and analyses, which can also be applied to other traffic monitoring
datasets.

proposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining
Recurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution

spread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are
carried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal

significant improvement over existing methods, which indicates that it is a
simple but effective method to improve model robustness.

directly fine-tuned in the target language, CDCS adapts a few-shot

parameters, which can be best reused in a domain-specific language. We evaluate
the proposed approach on two domain-specific languages, namely, SQL and
Solidity, with model transferred from two widely used languages (Python and

conventional pre-trained code models that are directly fine-tuned in

multiple stellar populations that offer new possibilities for modeling. A
promising tool for the dynamical modeling of these objects is the Schwarzschild
orbit superposition method. In this work we extend our previous implementation
of the scheme to include more than one population of stars and a more general
form of the mass-to-light ratio function. We tested the improved approach on a
nearly spherical, gas-free galaxy formed in the cosmological context from the
Illustris simulation. We modeled the binned velocity moments for stars split
into two populations by metallicity and demonstrate that in spite of larger
sampling errors the increased number of constraints leads to significantly
tighter confidence regions on the recovered density and velocity anisotropy
profiles. We then applied the method to the Fornax dSph galaxy with stars
similarly divided into two populations. In comparison with our earlier work, we
find the anisotropy parameter to be slightly increasing, rather than
decreasing, with radius and more strongly constrained. We are also able to
infer anisotropy for each stellar population separately and find them to be
significantly different.

viewed as one of the biggest challenges facing academic scholars as well as
policy makers. Unfortunately, research on this issue is currently lacking. This
study is the first to introduce the theoretical concept of targeted level of
income inequality for a given size of population. By employing the World Bank's
data on population size and Gini coefficient from sixty-nine countries in 2012,
this study finds that the relationship between Gini coefficient and natural
logarithm of population size is nonlinear in the form of a second-degree
polynomial function. The estimated results using regression analysis show that
the majority of countries in the sample have Gini coefficients either too high
or too low compared to their appropriate values. These findings could be used
as a guideline for policy makers before designing and implementing public
policies in order to achieve the targeted level of income inequality.

constants and moduli shows that BaGa2 possesses fairly isotropic mechanical
properties, reasonably good machinability, low Debye temperature and melting
point. The chemical bonding in BaG2 is interpreted via the electronic energy
density of states, electron density distribution, elastic properties and
Mulliken bond population analysis. The compound possesses both ionic and
covalent bondings. The reflectivity spectra show strong anisotropy with respect
to polarization of the incident electric field in the visible to
mid-ultraviolet regions. High reflectivity over wide spectral range makes BaGa2
suitable as a reflecting material. BaGa2 is also an efficient absorber of
ultraviolet radiation. Furthermore, the refractive index is quite high in the

abstract programming model for embedded and cyber-physical systems, including
the locally synchronous components of IoT systems. Security in such systems is
severely compromised due to low-level programming, ill-defined interfaces and
inattention to security classification of data. By incorporating a
Denning-style lattice-based secure information flow framework into a
synchronous reactive data flow language, we provide a framework in which
correct-and-secure-by-construction implementations for such systems may be
specified and derived. In particular, we propose an extension of the Lustre
programming framework with a security type system. The novelty of our type
system lies in a symbolic formulation of constraints over security type
variables, in particular the treatment of node calls, which allows us to reason
about secure flow with respect to any security class lattice. The main theorem
is the soundness of our type system with respect to the co-inductive
operational semantics of Lustre, which we prove by showing that well-typed
programs exhibit non-interference. Rather than tackle the full language, we
first prove the non-interference result for a well-behaved sub-language called
""Normalised Lustre"" (NLustre), for which our type system is far simpler. We
then show that Bourke et al.'s semantics-preserving ""normalisation""
transformations from Lustre to NLustre are security-preserving as well. This
preservation of security types by the normalisation transformations is a
property akin to ""subject reduction"" but at the level of compiler
transformations. The main result that well-security-typed Lustre programs are
non-interfering follows from a reduction to our earlier result of
non-interference for NLustre via the semantics-preservation (of Bourke et al.)
and type preservation results.

forward-shifts of a given flat output can be chosen in principle as a new
input, and subsequently how to actually introduce the new input by a suitable
feedback. With respect to the choice of a feasible input, easily verifiable
conditions are derived. Introducing such a new input requires a feedback which
may in general depend not only on this new input itself but also on its
forward-shifts. This is similar to the continuous-time case, where feedbacks
which depend on time derivatives of the closed-loop input - and in particular
quasi-static ones - have already been used successfully for the exact
linearization of flat systems since the nineties of the last century. For
systems with a flat output that does not depend on forward-shifts of the input,
it is shown how to systematically construct a new input such that the total
number of the corresponding forward-shifts of the flat output is minimal.
Furthermore, it is shown that in this case the calculation of a linearizing
feedback is particularly simple, and the subsequent design of a discrete-time
flatness-based tracking control is discussed. The presented theory is
illustrated by the discretized models of a wheeled mobile robot and a 3DOF

Conventional Hamiltonian learning methods either require costly process

neuron coverage metrics and coverage-driven methods to generate DNN test cases.

  In this paper, we conduct a replication study of the work by Yan et al. and
extend the experiments for deeper analysis. A larger model and a dataset of
higher resolution images are included to examine the generalizability of the

retrain cannot repair defects uncovered by coverage-driven methods. They
attribute this to the fact that the two types of methods use different

non-differentiable transformations. We test several hypotheses and further show
that even coverage-driven methods are constrained only to perform

drives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing

DL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage
the auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However,
existing auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and
overlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor
codes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning
framework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with
limited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences
among subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of
one subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost
model of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the
family and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real
hardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model.
Our experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same
code performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks.

the results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations. We combined isochrone
models with theoretical periods to simulate the distribution of fundamental
mode LPV pulsators, which include Miras, in the period-age plane, and we
compared it with observations of LPVs in Galactic and Magellanic Clouds'
clusters. In agreement with observations, models predict that the fundamental
mode period decreases with increasing age because of the dominant role of mass
in shaping stellar structure and evolution. At a given age, the period
distribution shows a non-negligible width and is skewed toward short periods,
except for young C-rich stars. As a result, the period-age relations of O-rich
and C-rich models are predicted to have different slopes. We derived best-fit
relations describing age and initial mass as a function of the fundamental mode
period for both O- and C-rich models. The study confirms the power of the
period-age relations to study populations of LPVs of specific types, either
O-rich or C-rich, on statistical grounds. In doing so, it is recommended not to
limit a study to Miras, which would make it prone to selection biases, but
rather to include semi-regular variables that pulsate predominantly in the
fundamental mode. The use of the relations to study individual LPVs, on the
other hand, requires more care given the scatter in the period distribution
predicted at any given age.

dense singular point, in a process known as the Big Bang. The hot and dense
matter which dominated the system within a few microseconds of its birth was in
the form of a soup of elementary quarks and gluons, known as the quark-gluon
plasma (QGP). Signatures compatible with the formation of the QGP matter have
experimentally been observed in heavy-ion (such as Au or Pb) collisions at
ultra-relativistic energies. Recently, experimental data of proton-proton (pp)
collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have also shown signals
resembling those of the QGP formation, which made these studies quite
stimulating as to how the collision of small systems features in producing the
early universe signals. In this article, we report on some of the compelling
experimental results and give an account of the present understanding. We
review the pp physics program at the LHC and discuss future prospects in the
context of exploring the nature of the primordial matter in the early universe.

characterizes the movement of four feet. Guided by the phases, the quadruped
robot is able to locomote according to the generated gaits, such as walk, trot,
pacing and bounding, and to make transitions among those gaits. More general
phases can be used to generate complex gaits, such as mixed rhythmic dancing.

e.g., $mm2$ point group, $\mathrm{HfO_2}$ and $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ are special in
that they are close to the border of 7 and 8 cation coordination, such that the

barrier. Other 7-coordination candidates, including $\mathrm{SrI_2}$, TaON,

$\mathrm{HfO_2}$/$\mathrm{ZrO_2}$, and six switching paths are analyzed in

  Semiconductors",,,"10.1103/PhysRevB.105.115201",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Defects are crucial in determining the overall physical properties of
semiconductors. Generally, the charge-state transition level (TEL), one of the
key physical quantities that determines the dopability of defects in
semiconductors, is temperature dependent. However, little is known about the
temperature dependence of TEL, and, as a result, almost all existing defect
theories in semiconductors are built on a temperature-independent
approximation. In this article, by deriving the basic formulas for
temperature-dependent TEL, we have established two fundamental rules for the
temperature dependence of TEL in semiconductors. Based on these rules,
surprisingly, it is found that the temperature dependences of TEL for different
defects are rather diverse: it can become shallower, deeper, or stay unchanged.
This defect-specific behavior is mainly determined by the synergistic or
opposing effects between free energy corrections (determined by the local
volume change around the defect during a charge-state transition) and band edge
changes (which differ for different semiconductors). These basic formulas and
rules, confirmed by a large number of state-of-the-art temperature-dependent
defect calculations in GaN, may potentially be widely adopted as guidelines for
understanding or optimizing doping behaviors in semiconductors at finite
temperatures.

a disaster is often difficult. In this study, specific indicators were
developed to analyze resilience, and the trajectories of resilience were
compared. Energy production is relevant for describing variations in social and
economic activities. This indicator was applied to a case study of a natural
disaster, that is Hurricane Irma in 2017. The hurricane caused fatalities and
destruction in the Caribbean islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy,
which are two French overseas territories. Energy production after Hurricane
Irma exhibited a significant decrease due to the destruction of the electricity
network as well as perturbations in economic and social activities. The energy
production restoration rate was higher in Saint Barthelemy than in Saint
Martin. The electricity restoration rate after a disaster was almost constant.
However, the energy production 18 months after Hurricane Irma was identical to
that before Hurricane Irma in Saint Barthelemy; this was not the case in Saint
Martin. During resilience, an increase in the gap between energy production in
Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin was observed. This study indicated that this
gap represents an inequality growth between Saint Barthelemy (gross domestic
product (GDP) of 40 000 euros/inhabitant) and Saint Martin (GDP of 16 600
euros/inhabitant). The indicators emphasized that inequality growth after
natural disasters favors less vulnerable and more resilient territories. The
number of inhabitants must be considered during indicator construction to avoid
any bias.

The behavior of this system will be investigated at short distances. At such
scales, we will have to incorporate quantum gravitational corrections to the
supergravity solutions. We will study the non-equilibrium quantum
thermodynamics of this black M2-M5 bound state. The quantum work for this
solution will be obtained using the Jarzynski equality. We will also study the
corrections to the thermodynamic stability of this system from quantum
gravitational corrections. We will use the concept of a novel quantum mass to
analyze the quantum gravitational corrections to the information geometry of
this system. This will be done using effective quantum metrics for this system.

Galilean conformal field theory ($GCFT_2$) which is dual to the asymptotically
flat spacetime described by the generalized minimal massive gravity (GMMG). To
this end we consider the Renyi entanglement entropy formula that can be related
to the reflected entropy by some manipulations of the replica technique. In a
limited case, we find the reflected entropy is twice the minimal entanglement
wedge cross section (EWCS) and this is an evidence on the relation between the
reflected entropy and the EWCS in the flat holography scenario.

of the fact that the set of primes $p$ such that $p \mid P(n)$, for some $n \in

domains.

  feedback control technique",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stability and control of a non-linear system represent an important system
configuration that frequently arises in practical engineering. Stability covers
a vast range of systems that do not obey the superposition principle and
applies to more real-world systems because all real control systems are
non-linear. For efficient stabilization of these systems, a great number of
researches have been proposed. This paper surveys some well-known facts as well
as some recent developments and different strategies for the topic of
stabilization of non-linear systems by output feedback control techniques.
