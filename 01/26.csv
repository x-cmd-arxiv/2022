paper is to compute the biharmonic index and nullity of the proper biharmonic
immersion $\Phi$. After, we shall study in the detail the kernel of the
generalised Jacobi operator $I_2^\Phi$. We shall prove that it contains a
direction which admits a natural variation with vanishing first, second and
third derivatives, and such that the fourth derivative is negative. In the
second part of the paper we shall analyse the specific contribution of
$\varphi$ to the biharmonic index and nullity of $\Phi$. In this context, we
shall study a more general composition $\tilde{\Phi}=\tilde{\varphi} \circ i$,
where $\tilde{\varphi}: M^m \to {\mathbb S}^{n-1}(\frac{1}{\sqrt 2})$, $ m \geq

hypersphere. First, we shall determine a general sufficient condition which
ensures that the second variation of $\tilde{\Phi}$ is nonnegatively defined on
$\mathcal{C}\big (\tilde{\varphi}^{-1}T{\mathbb S}^{n-1}\big )$. Then we
complete this type of analysis on our Clifford torus and, as a complementary
result, we obtain the $p$-harmonic index and nullity of $\varphi$. In the final

Condorcet-consistency and ex post efficiency by introducing a lower bound on
the probability of Condorcet winners and an upper bound on the probability of
Pareto-dominated alternatives, respectively. We then show that the SDS that
assigns probabilities proportional to Copeland scores is the only anonymous,
neutral, and strategyproof SDS that can guarantee the Condorcet winner a

traversal directions are chosen by maximizing differential changes to one
feature set such that changes to another set are negligible. We show that this
problem is nearly equivalent to one of Rayleigh quotient maximization, and
provide a closed-form solution to it based on solving a generalized eigenvalue
equation. We use repeated computations of the corresponding optimal directions,

patients' life. In particular, non-calcified plaques pose a great challenge, as
they are harder to detect and more likely to rupture than calcified plaques.
While current deep learning techniques allow precise segmentation of real-life
images, the performance in medical images is still low. This is caused mostly
by blurriness and ambiguous voxel intensities of unrelated parts that fall on
the same value range. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for
segmenting calcified and non-calcified plaques in CCTA-CPR scans of coronary
arteries. The input slices are masked so only the voxels within the wall vessel
are considered for segmentation, thus, reducing ambiguity. This mask can be
automatically generated via a deep learning-based vessel detector, that
provides not only the contour of the outer artery wall, but also the inner
contour. For evaluation, we utilized a dataset in which each voxel is carefully
annotated as one of five classes: background, lumen, artery wall, calcified
plaque, or non-calcified plaque. We also provide an exhaustive evaluation by
applying different types of masks, in order to validate the potential of vessel
masking for plaque segmentation. Our methodology results in a prominent boost
in segmentation performance, in both quantitative and qualitative evaluation,
achieving accurate plaque shapes even for the challenging non-calcified
plaques. Furthermore, when using highly accurate masks, difficult cases such as
stenosis become segmentable. We believe our findings can lead the future
research for high-performance plaque segmentation.

  Object Retrieval","8 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, and 3 algorithm blocks, accepted to
  RA-L, preprint",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Retrieving an object from cluttered spaces suchas cupboards, refrigerators,
or bins requires tracking objects with limited or no visual sensing. In these
scenarios, contact feedback is necessary to estimate the pose of the objects,
yet the objects are movable while their shapes and number may be unknown,
making the association of contacts with objects extremely difficult. While
previous work has focused on multi-target tracking, the assumptions therein
prohibit using prior methods given only the contact-sensing modality. Instead,
this paper proposes the method Soft Tracking Using Contacts for Cluttered
Objects (STUCCO) that tracks the belief over contact point locations and
implicit object associations using a particle filter. This method allows
ambiguous object associations of past contacts to be revised as new information
becomes available. We apply STUCCO to the Blind Object Retrieval problem, where
a target object of known shape but unknown pose must be retrieved from clutter.
Our results suggest that our method outperforms baselines in four simulation
environments, and on a real robot, where contact sensing is noisy. In
simulation, we achieve grasp success of at least 65% on all environments while
no baselines achieve over 5%.

fundamental to investigate how matter accretes onto young massive stars, how it
is ejected, and how all this differs from the low-mass case. The massive
protocluster G31.41+0.31 is the ideal target to study all these processes
because observations at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths have resolved the
emission of the Main core into at least four massive dust continuum sources,
named A, B, C, and D, within 1"" or 0.018 pc, and have identified signatures of
infall and several outflows associated with the core. Aims. We study the
interplay between infall and outflow in G31.41+0.31 by investigating at a
spatial resolution of a few 100 au their properties and their possible impact
on the core. Methods. We carried out molecular line observations of typical
high-density tracers, such as CH3CN or H2CO, and shock and outflow tracers,
such as SiO, with ALMA at 1.4 mm that achieved an angular resolution of 0.09""
(340 au). Results. The observations have revealed inverse P-Cygni profiles in
CH3CN and H2CO toward the four sources embedded in the Main core, suggesting
that all of them are undergoing collapse. The infall rates, estimated from the
red-shifted absorption are on the order of 1E-2 Msun/yr. The individual infall
rates imply that the accretion timescale of the Main core is an order of
magnitude smaller than its rotation timescale. This confirms that rotating
toroids such as the G31 Main core are non-equilibrium, transient collapsing
structures that need to be constantly replenished with fresh material from a
large-scale reservoir. For sources B, C, and D, the infall could be
accelerating inside the sources, while for source A, the presence of a second
emission component complicates the interpretation. The SiO observations have

schemes, such as the Multigrid Reduction in Time (MGRIT) method, remedy this by
parallelizing across time-steps, and have shown promising results for parabolic
problems. However, chaotic problems have proved more difficult, since chaotic
initial value problems are inherently ill-conditioned. MGRIT relies on a
hierarchy of successively coarser time-grids to iteratively correct the
solution on the finest time-grid, but due to the nature of chaotic systems,
subtle inaccuracies on the coarser levels can lead to poor coarse-grid
corrections. Here we propose a modification to nonlinear FAS multigrid, as well
as a novel time-coarsening scheme, which together better capture long term
behavior on coarse grids and greatly improve convergence of MGRIT for chaotic
initial value problems. We provide supporting numerical results for the Lorenz

system management overhead can be significantly reduced. Second, in a
relational database, data management along the storage hierarchy is fully
integrated with query processing, and thus it can continue model serving even
if the working set size exceeds the available memory. Applying model
deduplication can greatly reduce the storage space, memory footprint, cache

are not applicable to the deep learning model serving applications in
relational databases. They do not consider the impacts on model inference
accuracy as well as the inconsistency between tensor blocks and database pages.
This work proposed synergistic storage optimization techniques for duplication
detection, page packing, and caching, to enhance database systems for model
serving. We implemented the proposed approach in netsDB, an object-oriented
relational database. Evaluation results show that our proposed techniques
significantly improved the storage efficiency and the model inference latency,

paradigm for leveraging a huge amount of unlabeled data while mitigating the

struggled to handle inaccurate or noisy pseudo labels, which degenerate
performance.
  In this paper, we address this limitation with a novel SSL framework for
aggregating pseudo labels, called AggMatch, which refines initial pseudo labels
by using different confident instances. Specifically, we introduce an
aggregation module for consistency regularization framework that aggregates the
initial pseudo labels based on the similarity between the instances. To enlarge
the aggregation candidates beyond the mini-batch, we present a class-balanced
confidence-aware queue built with the momentum model, encouraging to provide
more stable and consistent aggregation. We also propose a novel
uncertainty-based confidence measure for the pseudo label by considering the
consensus among multiple hypotheses with different subsets of the queue. We
conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of AggMatch over the
latest methods on standard benchmarks and provide extensive analyses.

eigenmodes of the system are thus nonlinearly coupled, and one of them may
induce a parametric amplification of the other, called an autoparametric
resonance of the system. The parametric amplification implies two time scales,
a fast one for the forcing and a slow one for the forced mode, thus a
multiscale expansion is suitable to get amplitude equations describing the slow
dynamics of the oscillators. We recall the parametric resonance in a
dissipationless system, the parametrically forced Duffing oscillator, with
emphasis on the energy transfer between the oscillator and the source that
ensures the parametric forcing. Energy conservation is observed when averaging
is done on the slow time scale relevant to parametric amplification,evidenced
by a constant of the motion in the amplitude equation. Then we study a dimer in
a periodic potential well, which is a conservative but non integrable system.
When the dimer energy is such that it is trapped in neighboring potential
wells, we derive coupled nonlinear differential equations for the eigenmodes
amplitudes (center of mass motion and relative motion). We exhibit two
constants of the motion, which demonstrates that the amplitude equations are
integrable. We establish the conditions for autoparametric amplification of the
relative motion by the center of mass motion, and describe the phase portraits
of the system. In the opposite limit, when the dimer slides along the external
potential so that the center of mass motion is basically a translation, we
calculate the amplitude equation for the relative motion. In this latter case,
we also exhibit autoparametric amplification of the relative motions of the
dimer particles. In both cases, the comparison between numerical integration of
the actual system and the asymptotic analysis evidences an excellent agreement.

usually studied in the formulation of stochastic nonconvex-strongly-concave

preserving the privacy on primal and dual sides. To this end, we employ a
momentum-based stochastic gradient descent ascent to achieve a single-timescale

guarantees of both the primal and dual sides by perturbing the gradients on
both sides using well-calibrated Gaussian noises. As a result, our DPTD
algorithm could provide $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy (DP) guarantee

goal is to reveal as little pixel labels to the network as possible. We find
that, on average, the Oracle needs to reveal (i.e., annotate) less than 0.1% of
the pixels in order to train a network. The network can then label all pixels
in the image at an accuracy of more than 98%.
  Based on this single-image-annotation experiment, we design an experiment to
quickly annotate an entire data set. In the data set level experiment the
Oracle trains a new network for each image from scratch. The network can then
be used to create pseudo-labels, which are the network predicted labels of the

October 2017 from Europe, North Africa, and the USA. We derived 90 light curves
from this event, 42 of which yielded a central flash detection.
  We aimed at constraining Triton's atmospheric structure and the seasonal
variations of its atmospheric pressure since the Voyager 2 epoch (1989). We
also derived the shape of the lower atmosphere from central flash analysis. We
used Abel inversions and direct ray-tracing code to provide the density,
pressure, and temperature profiles in the altitude range $\sim$8 km to
$\sim$190 km, corresponding to pressure levels from 9 {\mu}bar down to a few
nanobars.
  Results. (i) A pressure of 1.18$\pm$0.03 {\mu}bar is found at a reference
radius of 1400 km (47 km altitude). (ii) A new analysis of the Voyager 2 radio
science occultation shows that this is consistent with an extrapolation of
pressure down to the surface pressure obtained in 1989. (iii) A survey of
occultations obtained between 1989 and 2017 suggests that an enhancement in
surface pressure as reported during the 1990s might be real, but debatable, due
to very few high S/N light curves and data accessible for reanalysis. The
volatile transport model analysed supports a moderate increase in surface
pressure, with a maximum value around 2005-2015 no higher than 23 {\mu}bar. The
pressures observed in 1995-1997 and 2017 appear mutually inconsistent with the
volatile transport model presented here. (iv) The central flash structure does
not show evidence of an atmospheric distortion. We find an upper limit of
0.0011 for the apparent oblateness of the atmosphere near the 8 km altitude.

a classification of semiclassical models defined by the way in which the wave

  Motivated by the consistent underestimation of risk by plug-in procedures, we
propose a new algorithm for bias correction and show how to apply it for

simpler ones on the basis of their interfaces, without inspecting their
internals. Digital circuits, despite having been studied for nearly a century
and used at scale for about half that time, have until recently evaded a fully
compositional theoretical understanding. The sticking point has been the need
to avoid feedback loops that bypass memory elements, the so called
`combinational feedback' problem. This requires examining the internal
structure of a circuit, defeating compositionality. Recent work remedied this
theoretical shortcoming by showing how digital circuits can be presented
compositionally as morphisms in a freely generated Cartesian traced (dataflow)
category. The focus was to support a better syntactical understanding of
digital circuits, culminating in the formulation of novel operational semantics
for digital circuits using an equational theory. The goals of this paper are
twofold. First we formalise the semantics of digital circuits by interpreting
them as functions on streams with certain properties. Second we refine the
previous equational theory so that it is in perfect agreement with the semantic
model. To support this result we introduce two key equations: the first can
eliminate non-delay-guarded feedback via finite unfoldings, and the second can
translate between circuits with the same behaviour syntactically by reducing
the problem to checking a finite number of closed circuits. While these are
enough to establish a correspondence between the denotational and the
equational frameworks, we also show how simpler equations can be derived for
more intuitive reasoning. The most important consequence of this is that we can
now give a recipe that ensures a circuit always produces observable output,
thus using the denotational model to inform and improve the operational
semantics.

converges to an equilibrium state described by the Hawking-Unruh temperature
$T_a=(a/2\pi)(\hbar/c)$. To relate this prediction to experimental observables,
a point-like charged particle, such as an electron, is considered in place of
the model detector. Instead of the detector's internal degree of freedom, the
electron's low-momentum fluctuations in the plane transverse to the
acceleration provide a degree of freedom and observables which are compatible
with the symmetry and thermalize by interaction with the radiation field.
General arguments in the accelerated frame suggest thermalization and a
fluctuation-dissipation relation but leave underdetermined the magnitude of
either the fluctuation or the dissipation. Lab frame analysis reproduces the
radiation losses, described by the classical Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation,
and reveals a classical stochastic force. We derive the fluctuation-dissipation
relation between the radiation losses and stochastic force as well as
equipartitation $\langle p_\perp^2\rangle = 2mT_a$ from classical
electrodynamics alone. The derivation uses only straightforward statistical
definitions to obtain the dissipation and fluctuation dynamics. Since high
accelerations are necessary for these dynamics to become important, we compare
classical results for the relaxation and diffusion times to strong-field
quantum electrodynamics results. We find that experimental realization will
require development of more precise observables. Even wakefield accelerators,
which offer the largest linear accelerations available in the lab, will require
improvement over current technology as well as high statistics to distinguish
an effect.

However, such a modeling approach is known not to be able to reproduce some of
the financial stylized facts, including the dynamics of volatility. In the
mathematical finance community, it has therefore emerged a new paradigm, named
rough volatility modeling, that represents the volatility dynamics of financial
assets as a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst exponent very small, which
indeed produces rough paths. At the same time, prices' time series have been
shown to be multiscaling, characterized by different Hurst scaling exponents.
This paper assesses the interplay, if present, between price multiscaling and
volatility roughness, defined as the (low) Hurst exponent of the volatility
process. In particular, we perform extensive simulation experiments by using
one of the leading rough volatility models present in the literature, the rough
Bergomi model. A real data analysis is also carried out in order to test if the
rough volatility model reproduces the same relationship. We find that the model
is able to reproduce multiscaling features of the prices' time series when a
low value of the Hurst exponent is used but it fails to reproduce what the real
data say. Indeed, we find that the dependency between prices' multiscaling and
the Hurst exponent of the volatility process is diametrically opposite to what
we find in real data, namely a negative interplay between the two.

measurements on the polycrystalline sample. No structural distortion was
detected from the temperature-dependant x-ray diffraction down to 12.5 K,
except a systematic lattice contraction. The magnetic susceptibility at high
temperatures agrees well with the high-temperature series expansion for a
spin-$5/2$ isotropic triangular lattice antiferromagnet with an average
exchange coupling of $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 1.8$ K rather than a one-dimensional
spin-$5/2$ chain model. This value of the exchange coupling is consistently
reproduced by the saturation field of the pulse field magnetization data. It
undergoes a magnetic long-range-order at $T_{\rm N} \simeq 10.4$ K. Neutron
diffraction experiments elucidate a collinear antiferromagnetic ordering below
$T_{\rm N}$ with the propagation vector $k = (1,0,0)$. An intermediate value of
frustration ratio ($f \simeq 3.6$) reflects moderate frustration in the
compound which is corroborated by a reduced ordered magnetic moment of $\sim
1.52$ $\mu_{\rm B}$ at 1.6 K, compared to its classical value ($5 \mu_{\rm
B}$). Magnetic isotherms exhibit a change of slope envisaging a field induced
spin-flop transition at $H_{\rm SF}\simeq3.2$ T. The magnetic field vs

reminiscent of a frustrated magnet with in-plane (XY-type) anisotropy.

generation based on deep learning has dramatically advanced. Image generation
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a promising study. However,
since convolutions are limited by spatial-agnostic and channel-specific,
features extracted by traditional GANs based on convolution are constrained.
Therefore, GANs are unable to capture any more details per image. On the other
hand, straightforwardly stacking of convolutions causes too many parameters and
layers in GANs, which will lead to a high risk of overfitting. To overcome the
aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a new GANs called
Involution Generative Adversarial Networks (GIU-GANs). GIU-GANs leverages a
brand new module called the Global Information Utilization (GIU) module, which
integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet) and involution to focus on
global information by channel attention mechanism, leading to a higher quality
of generated images. Meanwhile, Batch Normalization(BN) inevitably ignores the
representation differences among noise sampled by the generator, and thus
degrade the generated image quality. Thus we introduce Representative Batch
Normalization(RBN) to the GANs architecture for this issue. The CIFAR-10 and
CelebA datasets are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. A large number of experiments prove that our model achieves
state-of-the-art competitive performance.

polynomials over binary rings, and due to the polynomial size (from 10,000 to
60,000 bits), this operation is one of the costliest during key generation,
encapsulation, or decapsulation mechanisms. In this work, we revisit the
different existing constant-time algorithms for arbitrary polynomial
multiplication. We explore the different Karatsuba and Toom-Cook constructions
in order to determine the best combinations for each polynomial degree range,
in the context of AVX2 and AVX512 instruction sets. This leads to different
kernels and constructions in each case. In particular, in the context of
AVX512, we use the VPCLMULQDQ instruction, which is a vectorized binary
polynomial multiplication instruction. This instruction deals with up to four
polynomial (of degree up to 63) multiplications, the four results being stored
in one single 512-bit word. This allows to divide by roughly 3 the retired

these properties in one, two and three spatial dimension, for quadrilateral

has been shown to be very challenging. Angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) is well suited for the investigation of Floquet physics,
as it allows to directly probe the dressed electronic states of driven solids.
Depending on the system, scattering and decoherence can play an important role,
hampering the emergence of Floquet states. Another challenge is to disentangle
Floquet side bands from laser-assisted photoemission (LAPE), since both lead to
similar signatures in ARPES spectra. Here, we investigate the emergence of
Floquet state in the transition metal dichalcogenide $2H$-WSe$_2$, one of the
most promising systems for observing Floquet physics. We discuss how the
Floquet topological state manifests in characteristic features in the circular
dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions (CDAD) that is determined by
the transient band structure modifications and the associated texture of the
orbital angular momentum. Combining highly accurate modeling of the
photoemission matrix elements with an \emph{ab initio} description of the
light-matter interaction, we investigate regimes which can be realized in
current state-of-the-art experimental setups. The predicted features are robust
against scattering effects and are expected to be observed in forthcoming

ML-based agents that manage CPU cores, node power, and memory placement. Our

magnitude ($M_\text{W1}$) selected samples from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly

Survey Explorer (WISE) in the redshift range $0.07 \leq z < 0.43$. We compute
the galaxy two-point correlation function (2pCF) and compare the clustering
lengths between subsamples binned in $M_\text{W1}$ and in redshift. We also
measure the marked correlation functions (MCFs) using the luminosities in the
WISE W1 to W4 (3.4 to 22 $\mu$m) bands as marks. Additionally, we compare the
measurements of MCFs with different estimates of stellar mass and star
formation rate used as marks. Finally, we check how different selections
applied to the sample affect the clustering measurements. We show strong
clustering dependence on the W1 absolute magnitude: galaxies brighter in the W1
band are more strongly clustered than their fainter counterparts. We also
observe a lack of significant redshift dependence of clustering in the redshift
range $0.07 \leq z < 0.43$. We show that although W1 and W2 bands are direct
indicators of stellar mass, a galaxy sample selected based on W1 or W2 bands
does not perfectly show the clustering behaviour of a stellar mass selected

the capability of autonomous flying to carry out their mission successfully. In
order to allow these autonomous flights, drones need to know their location
constantly. Then, based on the current position and the final destination,
navigation commands will be generated and drones will be guided to their
destination. Localization can be easily carried out in outdoor environments
using GPS signals and drone inertial measurement units (IMUs). However, such an
approach is not feasible in indoor environments or GPS-denied areas. In this
paper, we propose a localization scheme for drones called PILOT (High-Precision
Indoor Localization for Autonomous Drones) that is specifically designed for
indoor environments. PILOT relies on ultrasonic acoustic signals to estimate
the target drone's location. In order to have a precise final estimation of the
drone's location, PILOT deploys a three-stage localization scheme. The first
two stages provide robustness against the multi-path fading effect of indoor
environments and mitigate the ranging error. Then, in the third stage, PILOT
deploys a simple yet effective technique to reduce the localization error
induced by the relative geometry between transmitters and receivers and
significantly reduces the height estimation error. The performance of PILOT was
assessed under different scenarios and the results indicate that PILOT achieves
centimeter-level accuracy for three-dimensional localization of drones.

fundamental and long-standing problem in machine learning. Recently,
multi-scale encoding schemes (such as Space2Vec) were proposed to directly
encode any point in 2D space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been
successfully applied to various (geo)spatial prediction tasks. However, a map
projection distortion problem rises when applying location encoding models to
large-scale real-world GPS coordinate datasets (e.g., species images taken all

encoding points in a 2D (Euclidean) space but not on a spherical surface, e.g.,
earth surface. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-scale location
encoding model called Sphere2V ec which directly encodes point coordinates on a
spherical surface while avoiding the mapprojection distortion problem. We
provide theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec encoding preserves the spherical
surface distance between any two points. We also developed a unified view of
distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the Double Fourier Sphere

analysis shows that Sphere2V ec outperforms other 2D space location encoder
models especially on the polar regions and data-sparse areas for image

preservation.

impose an exponential penalty on the integral of a quadratic function of the

behaviour more conservative in terms of tail distributions. We use a
frequency-domain representation of the QEF growth rate for the invariant
Gaussian quantum state of the system with vacuum input fields in order to
compute it in state space. The QEF rate is related to a similar functional for
a classical stationary Gaussian random process generated by an infinite cascade
of linear systems. A truncation of this shaping filter allows the QEF rate to
be computed with any accuracy by solving a recurrent sequence of algebraic
Lyapunov equations together with an algebraic Riccati equation. The state-space

Especially since the rise of graph neural networks (GNNs), the deep learning

results of these publications proves to be difficult. We make three
contributions. First, we present an open-source benchmark suite for the NP-hard
Maximum Independent Set problem, in both its weighted and unweighted variants.
The suite offers a unified interface to various state-of-the-art traditional
and machine learning-based solvers. Second, using our benchmark suite, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of the popular guided tree search algorithm by Li
et al. [NeurIPS 2018], testing various configurations on small and large
synthetic and real-world graphs. By re-implementing their algorithm with a
focus on code quality and extensibility, we show that the graph convolution
network used in the tree search does not learn a meaningful representation of
the solution structure, and can in fact be replaced by random values. Instead,
the tree search relies on algorithmic techniques like graph kernelization to
find good solutions. Thus, the results from the original publication are not
reproducible. Third, we extend the analysis to compare the tree search
implementations to other solvers, showing that the classical algorithmic
solvers often are faster, while providing solutions of similar quality.
Additionally, we analyze a recent solver based on reinforcement learning and
observe that for this solver, the GNN is responsible for the competitive
solution quality.

deployment (RTD) of a multi-quadcopter system between moving initial and final
configurations arbitrarily distributed in a 3-D motion space. The proposed RTD
problem is decomposed into spatial planning, temporal planning and acquisition
sub-problems. For the spatial planning, the RTD desired coordination is defined
by integrating (i) rigid-body rotation, (ii) one-dimensional homogeneous
deformation, and (ii) one-dimensional heterogeneous coordination such that
necessary conditions for inter-agent collision avoidance between every two
quadcopter UAVs are satisfied. By the RTD temporal planning, this paper
suffices the inter-agent collision avoidance between every two individual
quadcopters, and assures the boundedness of the rotor angular speeds for every
individual quadcopter. For the RTD acquisition, each quadcopter modeled by a
nonlinear dynamics applies a nonlinear control to stably and safely track the
desired RTD trajectory such that the angular speeds of each quadcopter remain
bounded and do not exceed a certain upper limit.

have become a major burden for healthcare systems worldwide. Demographic
changes suggest that wound care will play an even bigger role in the coming
decades. Predicting and monitoring response to therapy in wound care is
currently largely based on visual inspection with little information on the

approaches that facilitate personalized diagnostics and treatments at the
point-of-care. It has been recently shown that ultrasound imaging can monitor
response to therapy in wound care, but this work required onerous manual image
annotations. In this study, we present initial results of a deep learning-based
automatic segmentation of cross-sectional wound size in ultrasound images and
identify requirements and challenges for future research on this application.
Evaluation of the segmentation results underscores the potential of the
proposed deep learning approach to complement non-invasive imaging with Dice

time and could overcome the baseline limitations of existing amplitude
interferometers. Intensity interferometers do not rely on phase coherence of
the optical elements and thus function without high grade optics and light
combining delay lines. However, the coherence time of starlight observed with
realistic optical filter bandwidths (> 0.1 nm) is usually much smaller than the
time resolution of the detection system (> 10 ps), resulting in a greatly
reduced correlation signal. Reaching high signal to noise in a reasonably short
measurement time can be achieved in different ways: either by increasing the
time resolution, which increases the correlation signal height, or by
increasing the photon rate, which decreases statistical uncertainties of the
measurement. We present laboratory measurements employing both approaches and
directly compare them in terms of signal to noise ratio. A high time-resolution
interferometry setup designed for small to intermediate size optical telescopes
and thus lower photon rates (diameters < some meters) is compared to a setup
capable of measuring high photon rates, which is planned to be installed at
Cherenkov telescopes with dish diameters of > 10 m. We use a Xenon lamp as a
common light source simulating starlight. Both setups measure the expected
correlation signal and work at the expected shot-noise limit of statistical
uncertainties for measurement times between 10 min and 23 h. We discuss the
quantitative differences in the measurement results and give an overview of
suitable operation regimes for each of the interferometer concepts.

they provide kinetics of the excited state and ground state population of the
selected transition. The emission and absorption signatures showed multiple
peaks in their temporal profiles, although they appeared at different spatial
locations and times after the plasma onset. The absorption temporal profiles
showed an early time signature representing shock wave propagation into the
ambient gas. We also used emission and absorption spectral features for
measuring various physical properties of the plasma. The absorption spectral
profiles are utilized for measuring linewidths, column density, and kinetic
temperature while emission spectra were used to measure excitation temperature.
A comparison between excitation and the kinetic temperature was made at various
spatial points in the plasma. Our results highlight that the TOF measurements
provide a resourceful tool for showing the spatiotemporal LPP dynamics with
higher spatial and temporal resolution than is possible with spectral
measurements but are difficult to interpret without additional information on
excitation temperatures and linewidths. The combination of absorption and
emission TOF and spectral measurements thus provides a more complete picture of
LPP spatiotemporal dynamics than is possible using any one technique alone.

robust with respect to the uncertainties in loads and material parameters.
However, there are several alternatives to consider such uncertainties in
structural optimization problems. This paper presents a comprehensive
comparison between the results of three different approaches to topology
optimization under uncertain loading, considering stress constraints: 1) the
robust formulation, which requires only the mean and standard deviation of
stresses at each element; 2) the reliability-based formulation, which imposes a
reliability constraint on computed stresses; 3) the non-probabilistic
formulation, which considers a worst-case scenario for the stresses caused by
uncertain loads. The information required by each method, regarding the
uncertain loads, and the uncertainty propagation approach used in each case is
quite different. The robust formulation requires only mean and standard
deviation of uncertain loads; stresses are computed via a first-order
perturbation approach. The reliability-based formulation requires full
probability distributions of random loads, reliability constraints are computed
via a first-order performance measure approach. The non-probabilistic
formulation is applicable for bounded uncertain loads; only lower and upper
bounds are used, and worst-case stresses are computed via a nested optimization
with anti-optimization. The three approaches are quite different in the
handling of uncertainties; however, the basic topology optimization framework
is the same: the traditional density approach is employed for material
parameterization, while the augmented Lagrangian method is employed to solve
the resulting problem, in order to handle the large number of stress
constraints.

often quite complex and optimized for recommendation accuracy. They combine
several building blocks based on collaborative filtering and content-based

recommendations to end users, which is particularly important for
recommendations perceived as unexpected or inappropriate. While pure

explainability has a positive impact on other factors such as trust and

common dimensions and goals of recommenders' explainability and in general of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), and elaborate on the extent to which
these apply -- or need to be adapted -- to the specific characteristics of
music consumption and recommendation. Then, we show how explainability

accuracy-based evaluation criteria, we also discuss requirements and strategies
for evaluating explanations of music recommendations. Finally, we describe the
current challenges for introducing explainability within a large-scale

  We lift logic locking to Higher Order Logic Locking (HOLL) by hiding a
higher-order relation, instead of a key of independent values, challenging the
attacker to discover this key relation to recreate the circuit functionality.
Our technique uses program synthesis to construct the locked design and
synthesize a corresponding key relation. HOLL has low overhead and existing
attacks for logic locking do not apply as the entity to be recovered is no more
a value. To evaluate our proposal, we propose a new attack (SynthAttack) that
uses an inductive synthesis algorithm guided by an operational circuit as an
input-output oracle to recover the hidden functionality. SynthAttack is
inspired by the SAT attack, and similar to the SAT attack, it is verifiably
correct, i.e., if the correct functionality is revealed, a verification check
guarantees the same. Our empirical analysis shows that SynthAttack can break
HOLL for small circuits and small key relations, but it is ineffective for

particular the relative importance of interband and intraband transitions,
remains incomplete. Here we report theoretical predictions of hot-carrier
generation rates in spherical nanoparticles of the noble metals silver, gold
and copper with diameters up to 30 nanometers obtained from a novel atomistic
linear-scaling approach. As the nanoparticle size increases the relative
importance of interband transitions from d-bands to sp-bands relative to
surface-enabled sp-band to sp-band transitions increases. We find that the
hot-hole generation rate is characterized by a peak at the onset of the
d-bands, while the position of the corresponding peak in the hot-electron
distribution can be controlled through the illumination frequency. In contrast,
intraband transitions give rise to hot electrons, but relatively cold holes.
Importantly, increasing the dielectric constant of the environment removes hot
carriers generated from interband transitions, while increasing the number of
hot carriers from intraband transitions. The insights resulting from our work
enable the design of nanoparticles for specific hot-carrier applications

cooperative AmBC network under HIs, and study the impacts of HIs on the
achievable rates of the primary link and the AmBC link. In particular, we
theoretically prove that although HIs degrades the rate of each link, the
mutualism relationship between the AmBC and primary links is maintained, i.e.,
the rate of the primary link in the mutualistic cooperative AmBC network is
still higher than that without the AmBC link. The closed-form rate expressions
of both the AmBC and primary links are derived. Computer simulations are
provided to validate our theoretical analysis.

of surfaces are deduced from combinatorial constructions with graphs. This
provides a direct route from combinatorics of graphs to string topology
operations via topology, geometry and algebra.
  In particular, the inclusion of trees into graphs and the dissection of
graphs into aggregates yield a concise formalism for cyclic and modular operads
as well as their polycyclic and surface type generalizations. The latter occur
prominently in two-dimensional topological field theory and in string topology.
The categorical viewpoint allows us to use left Kan extensions of Feynman
operations as an efficient computational tool. The computations involve the
study of certain categories of structured graphs which are expected to be of

significantly modify the total xenon NR spectrum at large recoil energies
compared to that expected from the CE$\nu$NS process alone. Moreover, for
recoil energies $\gtrsim20$ keV, dominant contribution is obtained from the

compute the set $$ \{ \text{local Arthur parameter }\psi \ | \ \text{the local

four applications as follows. (1). We give a classification of all the local
Arthur packets which contain tempered representations, and give the precise
number of the tempered representations in any local Arthur packet and describe
their $L$-data. We also give a classification of all the local Arthur packets
which have non-trivial intersection with a given tempered local Arthur packet.

Arthur type, we specify a unique construction data satisfying the property that
if this representation lies in the $L$-packet of a local Arthur packet then
this construction data provides exactly the corresponding local Arthur

opportunity for data quality issues to emerge, particularly given that many of
these sensors do not have the benefit of official maintenance teams. To realise
the value of crowd sourced 'Internet of Things' type observations for
environmental modelling, we require approaches that can automate the detection
of outliers during the data modelling process so that they do not contaminate
the true distribution of the phenomena of interest. To this end, here we
present a Bayesian deep learning approach for spatio-temporal modelling of
environmental variables with automatic outlier detection. Our approach
implements a Gaussian-uniform mixture density network whose dual purposes -
modelling the phenomenon of interest, and learning to classify and ignore
outliers - are achieved simultaneously, each by specifically designed branches
of our neural network. For our example application, we use the Met Office's
Weather Observation Website data, an archive of observations from around 1900
privately run and unofficial weather stations across the British Isles. Using
data on surface air temperature, we demonstrate how our deep mixture model
approach enables the modelling of a highly skilled spatio-temporal temperature
distribution without contamination from spurious observations. We hope that
adoption of our approach will help unlock the potential of incorporating a
wider range of observation sources, including from crowd sourcing, into future

loss. However, the mechanism for this mass loss is unknown. Mass loss may
affect the evolutionary path, collapse and future supernova light curve of a
red supergiant, and its ultimate fate as either a neutron star or a black hole.
From November 2019 to March 2020, Betelgeuse - the second-closest red
supergiant to Earth (roughly 220 parsecs, or 724 light years, away) -
experienced a historic dimming of its visible brightness. Usually having an
apparent magnitude between 0.1 and 1.0, its visual brightness decreased to
1.614 +/- 0.008 magnitudes around 7-13 February 2020 - an event referred to as
Betelgeuse's Great Dimming. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations
showing that the southern hemisphere of Betelgeuse was ten times darker than
usual in the visible spectrum during its Great Dimming. Observations and
modelling support a scenario in which a dust clump formed recently in the
vicinity of the star, owing to a local temperature decrease in a cool patch
that appeared on the photosphere. The directly imaged brightness variations of
Betelgeuse evolved on a timescale of weeks. Our findings suggest that a

number of narrow filaments, roughly an order of magnitude increase in their
numbers compared to past measurements. For the first time, we carry out
population studies of the spectral index and magnetic field of the entire
region. The mean spectral indices of the filaments are steeper than supernova
remnants (SNRs) (-0.62) with a value of $\alpha\sim-0.83$. The variation in
$\alpha$ is much larger than for the SNRs, suggesting that these
characteristics have a different origin. A large-scale cosmic-ray driven wind
has recently been proposed to explain the origin of filaments and the
large-scale 430 pc bipolar radio and X-ray structure. This favors the
possibility that the large-scale bipolar radio/X-ray structure is produced by
past activity of Sgr A* rather than coordinated burst of supernovae. A trend of
steeper indices is also noted with increasing distance from the Galactic plane.
This could be explained either by synchrotron cooling or weak shocks
accelerating cosmic-ray particles in the context of the cosmic-ray driven wind.
The mean magnetic field strengths along the filaments ranges from $\sim100$ to
400 $\mu$G depending on the assumed ratio of cosmic-ray protons to electrons.
Given that there is a high cosmic ray pressure in the Galactic center, the
large equipartition magnetic field implies that the magnetic field is weak in
most of the interstellar volume of the Galactic center.

used to monitor at-risk communities to identify concerns and causes of
psychological stress. We created and monitored r/COVID19_support, an online
forum for people seeking support during the COVID-19 pandemic, on the platform
Reddit. We identify posts made by users self-identifying as students or posting
about college/university life, then coded these posts to identify emerging
themes that related to triggers of psychological anxiety and distress. 147
posts were made to the forum by 111 unique users during the study period. A
number of themes were identified by manual coding, included: feelings of grief
associated with the loss of college-related life experiences, such as
graduation ceremonies or proms; difficulties with focussing on online and
self-guided learning; and fears for the future, in particular of graduating
into a constrained job market. The identification of specific issues enabled
users to be signposted to information to help them cope with address those
particular concerns. Monitoring peer-to-peer forums can help to identify
specific issues with which vulnerable groups may require additional support,
enabling users to be signposted on to high-quality information to address
specific issues.

4.29-7.42 and their $\theta_{BN}$ angles are 15$^\circ$, 30$^\circ$, 45$^\circ$
and 50$^\circ$. The ULF wave foreshocks develop upstream of all of them. The
wavelength and the amplitude of the upstream waves exhibit a complex dependence
on the shock's M$_A$ and $\theta_{BN}$. The wavelength positively correlates
with both parameters, with the dependence on $\theta_{BN}$ being much stronger.
The amplitude of the ULF waves is proportional to the product of the reflected
beam velocity and density, which also depend on M$_A$ and $\theta_{BN}$. The
interaction of the ULF waves with the shock causes large-scale (several tens of
upstream ion inertial lengths) shock rippling. The properties of the shock
ripples are related to the ULF wave properties, namely thier wavelength and
amplitude. In turn, the ripples have a large impact on the ULF wave
transmission across the shock because they change local shock properties
($\theta_{BN}$, strength), so that different sections of the same ULF wave
front encounter shock with different characteristics. Downstream fluctuations
do not resemble the upstream waves in terms the wavefront extension,
orientation or their wavelength. However some features are conserved in the
Fourier spectra of downstream compressive waves that present a bump or
flattening at wavelengths approximately corresponding to those of the upstream
ULF waves. In the transverse downstream spectra these features are weaker.

make use of architecture patterns, such as Watchdog and Firewall, to address
identified failures and threats. Often, however, the deployment of safety
patterns has consequences on security, e.g., the deployment of a safety pattern
may lead to new threats. The other way around may also be possible, i.e., the
deployment of a security pattern may lead to new failures. Safety and security
co-design is, therefore, required to understand such consequences and
trade-offs, in order to reach appropriate system designs. Currently, pattern
descriptions, including their consequences, are described using natural
language. Therefore, their deployment in system design is carried out manually,
thus time-consuming and prone to human-error, especially given the high system
complexity. We propose the use of semantically-rich architecture patterns to
enable automated support for safety and security co-design by using Knowledge

architecture patterns can address failures or threats and consequences of
deploying such patterns. We demonstrate our approach on an example taken from

start from a Shakura--Sunyaev thin accretion disc with a steady-state radial
temperature profile $T(R)$ and assume that the variable flux is due to
axisymmetric temperature perturbations $\delta T(R,t)$. After linearizing the
equations, we fit UV-optical AGN lightcurves to determine $\delta T(R,t)$ for a
sample of seven AGNs. We see a diversity of $|\delta T/T| \sim 0.1$ fluctuation
patterns which are not dominated by outgoing waves traveling at the speed of
light as expected for the ""lamppost"" model used to interpret disc reverberation
mapping studies. Rather, the most common pattern resembles slow ($v \ll c$)
ingoing waves. An explanation for our findings is that these ingoing waves
trigger central temperature fluctuations that act as a lamppost, producing
lower amplitude temperature fluctuations moving outwards at the speed of light.
The lightcurves are dominated by the lamppost signal -- even though the
temperature fluctuations are dominated by other structures with similar
variability time-scales -- because the discs exponentially smooth the
contributions from the slower moving ($v \ll c$) fluctuations to the observed
lightcurves. This leads to lightcurves that closely resemble the expectations
for a lamppost model but with the slow variability time-scales of the ingoing
waves. This also implies that longer time-scale variability signals will
increasingly diverge from lamppost models because the smoothing of
slower-moving waves steadily decreases as their period or spatial wavelength
increases.

quantum computation. Recently, new stabilizer codes for scalable circuit-based
quantum computation have been introduced that have very high thresholds under
biased noise where the qubit predominantly suffers from one type of error, e.g.
dephasing. However, extending these advances in stabilizer codes to generate
high-threshold cluster states for biased noise has been a challenge, as the
standard method for foliating stabilizer codes to generate fault-tolerant
cluster states does not preserve the noise bias. In this work, we overcome this
barrier by introducing a generalization of the cluster state that allows us to
foliate stabilizer codes in a bias-preserving way. As an example of our
approach, we construct a foliated version of the XZZX code which we call the
XZZX cluster state. We demonstrate that under a circuit-level noise model, our
XZZX cluster state has a threshold more than double the usual cluster state
when dephasing errors are more likely than errors which cause bit flips by a
factor of $O(100)$ or more.

particular, there are regions which 1D stellar evolution models report to be

onset of convection. For sub-solar metallicity this opens up a \emph{stability

this surface stability region extends roughly between $8M_\odot$ and

<z < 0.8$. We find that galaxies at $z \sim 0.7$ have higher optical depth
$\tau_{B}^{f}$ and clumpiness $F$ than galaxies at $z \sim 0$. The increase in
$F$ hints that the stars of $z \sim 0.7$ galaxies are less likely to escape
their birth cloud, which might indicate that the birth clouds are larger. We
also found that $\tau_{B}^{f}$ increases with $M_{*}$ and $\mu_{*}$independent
of sample and therefore redshift. We found no clear trends in $\tau_{B}^{f}$ or
$F$ with $SFR$, which could imply that the dust mass distribution is
independent of $SFR$. In turn, this would imply that the balance of dust
formation and destruction is independent of the $SFR$. Based on an analysis of
the inclination-dependence of the Balmer decrement, we find that reproducing
the Balmer line emission requires not only a completely optically thick dust
component associated with star forming regions, as in the standard Tuffs et al.
model, but an extra component of optically thin dust within the birth clouds.
This new component implies the existence of dust inside HII regions that
attenuates the Balmer emission before it escapes through gaps in the birth
cloud and we find it is more important in high-mass galaxies.

(IGM) have implications for galaxy formation models and the baryon (re)cycling
process. The relative abundance of metals in high versus low-ionization states
has also been argued to be sensitive to the Universe's reionization history.
However, measurements of the background metallicity of the IGM at z~4 are
sparse and in poor agreement with one another, and reduced sensitivity in the
near-IR renders detecting individual metal absorbers nearly impossible. We
present a new clustering-based technique that enables the detection of these
weak IGM absorbers by statistically averaging over all spectral pixels, here
applied to the C IV forest. We simulate the z=4.5 IGM with different models of
inhomogeneous metal distributions and investigate its two-point correlation
function (2PCF) using mock skewers of the C IV forest. The 2PCF demonstrates a
clear peak at the doublet separation of the C IV line. The peak amplitude
scales quadratically with metallicity, while enrichment morphology affects both
the shape and amplitude of the 2PCF. The effect of enrichment topology can also
be framed in terms of the metal mass- and volume-filling factors, and we show
their trends as a function of the enrichment topology. For models consistent
with the distribution of metals at z~3, we find that we can constrain [C/H] to
within 0.2 dex, log$\,M_{\rm{min}}$ to within 0.4 dex, and $R$ to within 15%.
We show that strong absorbers arising from the circumgalactic medium of
galaxies can be easily identified and masked, allowing one to recover the
underlying IGM signal. The auto-correlation of the metal-line forest presents a
new and compelling avenue to simultaneously constrain IGM metallicity and
enrichment topology with high precision at z>4, thereby pushing such
measurements into the Epoch of Reionization.

and fragments of its environment play in characterising the ensuing dynamics.
We employ a class of dephasing models where the state of the initial
environment represents a tunable degree of freedom that qualitatively and
quantitatively affects the correlation profiles, but nevertheless results in
the same reduced dynamics for the system. We apply recently developed tools for
the characterisation of non-Markovianity to carefully assess the role that
correlations, as quantified by the (quantum) Jensen-Shannon divergence and
relative entropy, as well as changes in the environmental state, play in
whether the conditions for classical objectivity within the quantum Darwinism
paradigm are met. We demonstrate that for precisely the same non-Markovian
reduced dynamics of the system arising from different microscopic models, some
will exhibit quantum Darwinistic features, while others show no meaningful
notion of classical objectivity is present. Furthermore, our results highlight
that the non-Markovian nature of an environment does not a priori prevent a
system from redundantly proliferating relevant information, but rather it is
the system's ability to establish the requisite correlations that is the
crucial factor in the manifestation of classical objectivity.

rewrite, and update the foundations of the theory. Basic Quantum Algorithms
revisits the earliest quantum algorithms. The journey began in 1985 with
Deutsch attempting to evaluate a function at two domain points simultaneously.
Then, in 1992, Deutsch and Jozsa created a quantum algorithm that determines
whether a Boolean function is constant or balanced. The following year,
Bernstein and Vazirani realized that the same algorithm could be used to
identify a specific Boolean function within a set of linear Boolean functions.
In 1994, Simon introduced a novel quantum algorithm that determined whether a
function was one-to-one or two-to-one exponentially faster than any classical
algorithm for the same problem. That same year, Shor developed two
groundbreaking quantum algorithms for integer factoring and calculating
discrete logarithms, posing a threat to the widely used cryptography methods.
In 1995, Kitaev proposed an alternative version of Shor's algorithms that
proved valuable in numerous other applications. The following year, Grover
devised a quantum search algorithm that was quadratically faster than its
classical equivalent. With an emphasis on the circuit model, this work provides
a detailed description of all these remarkable algorithms.

$z\simeq1.1$, with D$_{n}$4000 increasing by $\simeq0.1$ across a $\simeq$ 1
dex mass interval for both VANDELS and LEGA-C. We then proceed to investigate
the evolution of the quiescent galaxy stellar mass-size relation from

$1.9\pm{0.1}$ at $\mathrm{log_{10}}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})=10.5$, and

fitted mass-size relations, to investigate how size and D$_{n}$4000 correlate.
For LEGA-C, we see a clear difference, with larger galaxies found to have
smaller D$_{n}$4000 at fixed stellar mass. Due to the faintness and smaller
numbers of the VANDELS sample, we cannot confirm whether a similar relation
exists at $z\simeq1.1$. We consider whether differences in stellar age or
metallicity are most likely to drive this size-D$_{n}$4000 relation, finding
that any metallicity differences are unlikely to fully explain the observed
offset, meaning smaller galaxies must be older than their larger counterparts.
We find the observed evolution in size, mass and D$_{n}$4000 across the
$\simeq2$ Gyr from $z\sim1.1$ to $z\sim0.7$ can be explained by a simple toy
model in which VANDELS galaxies evolve passively, whilst experiencing a series

to fractons. In order to resolve various subtleties in the precise meaning of
these global or gauge symmetries, we place these 1+1d theories on a lattice and

bifurcations (such as saddle-node ones) that delimit their existence, as well
as transcritical ones that lead to their potential exchange of stability. We
find that out of the four relevant branches, only one, the upper symmetric
branch, corresponds to a spectrally and dynamically robust solution. We
subsequently leverage detailed direct numerical computations in order to
explore the dynamics of the different states, corroborating our spectral
analysis results.

  Identification using Semi-Supervised Learning","Accepted at EMSE",,,,"cs.SE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Keeping track of and managing Self-Admitted Technical Debts (SATDs) is
important for maintaining a healthy software project. Current active-learning
SATD recognition tool involves manual inspection of 24% of the test comments on
average to reach 90% of the recall. Among all the test comments, about 5% are
SATDs. The human experts are then required to read almost a quintuple of the
SATD comments which indicates the inefficiency of the tool. Plus, human experts
are still prone to error: 95% of the false-positive labels from previous work
were actually true positives.
  To solve the above problems, we propose DebtFree, a two-mode framework based
on unsupervised learning for identifying SATDs. In mode1, when the existing
training data is unlabeled, DebtFree starts with an unsupervised learner to
automatically pseudo-label the programming comments in the training data. In
contrast, in mode2 where labels are available with the corresponding training
data, DebtFree starts with a pre-processor that identifies the highly prone
SATDs from the test dataset. Then, our machine learning model is employed to
assist human experts in manually identifying the remaining SATDs. Our
experiments on 10 software projects show that both models yield a statistically
significant improvement in effectiveness over the state-of-the-art automated
and semi-automated models. Specifically, DebtFree can reduce the labeling
effort by 99% in mode1 (unlabeled training data), and up to 63% in mode2
(labeled training data) while improving the current active learner's F1
relatively to almost 100%.

patients undergoing diagnostic FCH-PET studies and to compare such doses with
the MIRD method calculations. Methods: A patient cohort of 17 males were imaged
after intravenous administration of a mean FCH activity of 244.3 MBq. The
resulting PET/CT images were processed in order to generate individualized
input source and geometry files for dose computation with the MC tool GATE. The
resulting dose estimates were studied and compared to the MIRD method with two
different computational phantoms. Mass correction of the S-factors was applied
when possible. Potential sources of uncertainty were closely examined: the
effect of partial body images, urinary bladder emptying, and biokinetic
modeling.
  Results: Large differences in doses between our methodology and the MIRD
method were found, generally in the range of $\pm$25%, and up to $\pm$120% for
some cases. The mass scaling showed improvements, especially for non-walled and
high-uptake tissues. Simulations of the urinary bladder emptying showed
negligible effects on doses to other organs, with the exception of the
prostate. Dosimetry based on partial PET/CT images (excluding the legs)
resulted in an over-estimation of mean doses to bone, skin, and remaining
tissues, and minor differences in other organs/tissues. Estimated uncertainties
associated with the biokinetics of FCH introduce variations of cumulated
activities in the range of $\pm$10% in the high-uptake organs.
  Conclusions: The MC methodology allows for a higher degree of dosimetry
individualization than the MIRD methodology, which in some cases leads to
important differences in dose values. Dosimetry of FCH-PET based on a single
partial PET study seems viable due to the particular biokinetics of FCH, even
though some correction factors may need to be applied to estimate mean
skin/bone doses.

on four distinct classifiers - SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network, and kNN.
Furthermore, we explore additional considerations for fair evaluation when

antiferromagnetic spin chains with long-range (LR) interactions decaying as a
power law with distance with exponent $\alpha$. To this end, we extend the
real-space renormalization group technique for excited states (RSRG-X) to solve
this problem with LR interaction. For comparison, we perform numerical exact
diagonalization (ED) calculations. From the distribution of energy level
spacings, as obtained by ED for up to $N\sim 18$ spins, we find indications of
a delocalization transition at $\alpha_c \approx 1$ in the middle of the energy
spectrum. With RSRG-X and ED, we show that for $\alpha>\alpha^*$ the
entanglement entropy (EE) of excited eigenstates retains a logarithmic
divergence similar to the one observed for the ground state of the same model,
while for $\alpha<\alpha^*$ EE displays an algebraic growth with the subsystem
size $l$, $S_l\sim l^{\beta}$, with $0<\beta<1$. We find that $\alpha^* \approx
1$ coincides with the delocalization transition $\alpha_c$ in the middle of the
many-body spectrum. An interpretation of these results based on the structure
of the RG rules is proposed, which is due to {\it rainbow} proliferation for
very long-range interactions $\alpha\ll 1$. We also investigate the effective
temperature dependence of the EE allowing us to study the half-chain
entanglement entropy of eigenstates at different energy densities, where we
find that the crossover in EE occurs at $\alpha^* < 1$.

simulation method which shows better performance than other classic turbulence
models. It is composed of a small-eddy-dissipation mixing length (SED-ML) model
for calculating the reference solution and a parameter extension method for
correcting the solution. The mechanism of this method is more deeply analyzed
in this study to find out how to develop a turbulence model with a high
accuracy and a low computational cost. The turbulent channel flows with
Re_tau=821 and 2003 and decaying homogenous and isotropic turbulence are
simulated to demonstrate how the new turbulence simulation method works. The
small-eddy-dissipation (SED) mechanism for developing turbulence models has
been proposed through our analysis. According to this mechanism, the model
solution is an asymptotic approximation of the exact solution of the
Navier-Stokes equations. The modeling term introduces an artificial dissipation
which dissipates small eddies. The purpose of turbulence modeling is to
dissipate more small eddies without changing the statistical solution
qualitatively. We expect more small eddies can be dissipated where the
turbulence is stronger. This mechanism is different from RANS which
approximates the Reynolds stresses and LES which approximates the
sub-grid-scale (SGS) motions, while it interprets the physics of turbulence
modeling more precisely. A modified mixing length with two damping functions is
developed to identify the characteristic length of turbulence, leading to the
SED-ML model. The simulation accuracy can be further improved using a linear
extension. Our numerical results show that the SED-ML model is in accordance

manage the inter-system interference between radar and communication systems.
However, the studies in literature often assume that the DFRC possesses perfect
Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT), which is an unrealistic
assumption due to the inevitable CSIT errors in practical deployments. In this
work, we aim to design a DFRC system under the practical assumption of partial
CSIT. To achieve this, the proposed DFRC marries the capabilities of a
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access
(RSMA). RSMA is a powerful downlink communication scheme based on linearly
precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) that partially decodes multi-user interference
(MUI) and partially treats it as noise and is inherently robust to partial
CSIT. Using RSMA, the DFRC precoders are optimized in the presence of partial
CSIT to simultaneously maximize the Average Weighted Sum-Rate (AWSR) under
Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints and minimize the DFRC beampattern Mean
Squared Error (MSE) against an ideal MIMO radar beampattern. Simulation results
demonstrate that the RSMA-based DFRC largely outperforms DFRCs based on other
commonly used strategies such as Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA). Specifically, the common stream unique
in the RSMA-based DFRC allows for flexible rate partitioning to guarantee user
rate fairness with partial CSIT while also being the main contributor to
generating a directional beampattern for effective radar sensing. The practical
performance of the DFRC is then further assessed through Link-Level simulations
(LLS) to take into account the effects of coding and modulation in the finite
length regime as well as the channel aging due to mobility and latency, where
the superiority of RSMA is again corroborated.

relatively low-dimensional space (e.g., 100 variables). It is known that for
deterministic convex optimization problems of small dimensions, the fastest
convergence is achieved by the center of gravity type methods (e.g., Vaidya's
cutting plane method). For stochastic optimization problems, the question of
whether Vaidya's method can be used comes down to the question of how it
accumulates inaccuracy in the subgradient. The recent result of the authors
states that the errors do not accumulate on iterations of Vaidya's method,
which allows proposing its analog for stochastic optimization problems. The
primary technique is to replace the subgradient in Vaidya's method with its
probabilistic counterpart (the arithmetic mean of the stochastic subgradients).
The present paper implements the described plan, which ultimately leads to an
effective (if parallel computations for batching are possible) method for
solving convex stochastic optimization problems in relatively low-dimensional
spaces.

  Surfaces",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  State estimation for legged locomotion over a dynamic rigid surface (DRS),
which is a rigid surface moving in the world frame (e.g., ships, aircraft, and
trains), remains an under-explored problem. This paper introduces an invariant
extended Kalman filter that estimates the robot's pose and velocity during DRS
locomotion by using common sensors of legged robots (e.g., inertial measurement
units (IMU), joint encoders, and RDB-D camera). A key feature of the filter
lies in that it explicitly addresses the nonstationary surface-foot contact
point and the hybrid robot behaviors. Another key feature is that, in the
absence of IMU biases, the filter satisfies the attractive group affine and
invariant observation conditions, and is thus provably convergent for the
deterministic continuous phases. The observability analysis is performed to
reveal the effects of DRS movement on the state observability, and the
convergence property of the hybrid, deterministic filter system is examined for
the observable state variables. Experiments of a Digit humanoid robot walking
on a pitching treadmill validate the effectiveness of the proposed filter under
large estimation errors and moderate DRS movement. The video of the experiments
can be found at: https://youtu.be/ScQIBFUSKzo.

variables with orbital periods below the 0.22-day cutoff. Gaia parallaxes were
combined with Gaia and 2MASS photometry to obtain G and J-band absolute
magnitudes of 674 red variable stars catalogued as contact binaries in the VSX
database. The absolute magnitude of main sequence cool dwarfs varies strongly
with spectral type, which was used to create a selection of 218 systems with
primaries potentially of spectral types M0-M3. Lightcurves of the 46 systems
with lowest near-infrared luminosities were inspected individually to confirm
or reject the W UMa classification where possible. The extinction limits and
amplitudes were combined with the calculated absolute magnitudes in order to
set upper limits for the masses of the primary components. This is achieved via
the consideration that the luminosity of the primary is no less than that of a
main sequence star of the same mass. For 26 possible contact binaries the mass
of the primary was limited to less than 0.5 solar masses with some systems
having upper limits for the primary as low as 0.35 solar masses. These rare
systems are intriguing targets for more detailed observations since they are on
the low-mass end of the contact binary distribution and their formation and
evolution are still unclear.

source of error for extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) exoplanet
detection. Several methods are designed to disentangle stellar signals from
true center-of-mass shifts due to planets. The EXPRES Stellar Signals Project
(ESSP) presents a self-consistent comparison of 22 different methods tested on
the same extreme-precision spectroscopic data from EXPRES. Methods derived new
activity indicators, constructed models for mapping an indicator to the needed
RV correction, or separated out shape- and shift-driven RV components. Since no
ground truth is known when using real data, relative method performance is
assessed using the total and nightly scatter of returned RVs and agreement
between the results of different methods. Nearly all submitted methods return a
lower RV RMS than classic linear decorrelation, but no method is yet
consistently reducing the RV RMS to sub-meter-per-second levels. There is a
concerning lack of agreement between the RVs returned by different methods.
These results suggest that continued progress in this field necessitates
increased interpretability of methods, high-cadence data to capture stellar
signals at all timescales, and continued tests like the ESSP using consistent
data sets with more advanced metrics for method performance. Future comparisons
should make use of various well-characterized data sets -- such as solar data
or data with known injected planetary and/or stellar signals -- to better
understand method performance and whether planetary signals are preserved.

ignores the intersection between them and the third decouples the delivery of

only visual and textual understanding, but also the ability to align
cross-modality representations. Previous approaches extensively employ
entity-level alignments, such as the correlations between the visual regions
and their semantic labels, or the interactions across question words and object
features. These attempts aim to improve the cross-modality representations,
while ignoring their internal relations. Instead, we propose to apply
structured alignments, which work with graph representation of visual and
textual content, aiming to capture the deep connections between the visual and
textual modalities. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to represent and integrate
graphs for structured alignments. In this work, we attempt to solve this issue
by first converting different modality entities into sequential nodes and the
adjacency graph, then incorporating them for structured alignments. As
demonstrated in our experimental results, such a structured alignment improves
reasoning performance. In addition, our model also exhibits better
interpretability for each generated answer. The proposed model, without any
pretraining, outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on GQA dataset, and beats
the non-pretrained state-of-the-art methods on VQA-v2 dataset.

we collected over 2.8M tweets wishing happy birthday to 724K Twitter accounts.
For 50K accounts, their age was likely mentioned revealing their DOB, and 10%
were protected accounts. Our findings show that the majority of both public and
protected accounts seem to be accepting of their birthdays and DOB being
revealed online by their friends even when they do not have it listed on their
profiles. We further complemented our findings through a survey to measure
awareness of DOB disclosure issues and how people think about sharing different
types of birthday-related information. Our analysis shows that giving birthday
wishes to others online is considered a celebration and many users are quite
comfortable with it. This view matches the trend also seen in security where
the use of DOB in authentication process is no longer considered best practice.

multi-modal inputs are within two feature spaces. Moreover, reasoning in visual
question answering requires the model to understand both image and question,
and align them in the same space, rather than simply memorize statistics about
the question-answer pairs. Thus, it is essential to find component connections
between different modalities and within each modality to achieve better
attention. Previous works learned attention weights directly on the features.
However, the improvement is limited since these two modality features are in
two domains: image features are highly diverse, lacking structure and
grammatical rules as language, and natural language features have a higher
probability of missing detailed information. To better learn the attention
between visual and text, we focus on how to construct input stratification and
embed structural information to improve the alignment between different level
components. We propose Multi-Granularity Alignment architecture for Visual
Question Answering task (MGA-VQA), which learns intra- and inter-modality
correlations by multi-granularity alignment, and outputs the final result by
the decision fusion module. In contrast to previous works, our model splits
alignment into different levels to achieve learning better correlations without
needing additional data and annotations. The experiments on the VQA-v2 and GQA
datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms non-pretrained
state-of-the-art methods on both datasets without extra pretraining data and
annotations. Moreover, it even achieves better results over the pre-trained

reported strong evidence for a common stochastic process in their data sets.
The reported amplitudes are in tension with previously computed upper limits.
In this paper, we investigate how using a subset of a set of pulsars biases
Bayesian upper limit recovery. We generate 500 simulated PTA data sets based on
the NANOGrav 11-year data set with an injected stochastic gravitational wave
background (GWB). We then compute upper limits by sampling individual pulsar
likelihoods, and combine them through a factorized version of the PTA
likelihood to obtain upper limits on the GWB amplitude using different numbers
of pulsars. We find that it is possible to recover an upper limit (95\%
credible interval) \textit{below} the injected value, and that it is
significantly more likely for this to occur when using a subset of pulsars to
compute the upper limit. When picking pulsars to induce the maximum possible
bias, we find that the 95\% Bayesian upper limit recovered is below the
injected value in 10.6\% (53 of 500) of realizations. Further, we find that if
we choose a subset of pulsars in order to obtain a lower upper limit than when
using the full set of pulsars, the distribution of upper limits obtained from
these 500 realizations is shifted to lower amplitude values.

Only recurrent networks trained with small images learn solutions that

(0,1]$ (a parameter of the model) whenever the process visits a site for the
first time, with probability $p$ it gains a drift in a given direction (could
be any direction of the unit sphere). Otherwise, with probability $1-p$, it
behaves as a $d$-martingale with zero-mean vector. Whenever the process visits
an already-visited site, the process acts again as a $d$-martingale with
zero-mean vector. We refer to the model as a GERW in Bernoulli environment, in
short $p$-GERW. Under the same hypothesis of [7] (bounded jumps, uniform
ellipticity), we show that the $p$-GERW is ballistic for all $p\in (0,1]$.

are both interesting and hard to find and characterize, especially when they
have non-trivial shapes. We present in this paper a statistic that can be used
to estimate the (local) ""gappiness"" of a point in the data space. It uses the
gradient and Hessian of the density estimate (and thus requires a
twice-differentiable density estimator). This statistic can be computed at
(almost) any point in the space and does not rely on optimization; it allows to
highlight under-dense regions of any dimensionality and shape in a general and
efficient way. We illustrate our method on the velocity distribution of nearby
stars in the Milky Way disk plane, which exhibits gaps that could originate
from different processes. Identifying and characterizing those gaps could help
determine their origins. We provide in an Appendix implementation notes and
additional considerations for finding under-densities in data, using critical
points and the properties of the Hessian of the density.

mammographic breast mass classification using semi-supervised learning.
Although supervised deep learning has achieved huge success across various
medical image analysis tasks, its success relies on large amounts of
high-quality annotations, which can be challenging to acquire in practice. To
overcome this limitation, we propose employing a semi-supervised method, i.e.,
virtual adversarial training (VAT), to leverage and learn useful information
underlying in unlabeled data for better classification of breast masses.
Accordingly, our VAT-based models have two types of losses, namely supervised
and virtual adversarial losses. The former loss acts as in supervised
classification, while the latter loss aims at enhancing model robustness
against virtual adversarial perturbation, thus improving model
generalizability. To evaluate the performance of our VAT-based CAD scheme, we
retrospectively assembled a total of 1024 breast mass images, with equal number
of benign and malignant masses. A large CNN and a small CNN were used in this
investigation, and both were trained with and without the adversarial loss.
When the labeled ratios were 40% and 80%, VAT-based CNNs delivered the highest
classification accuracy of 0.740 and 0.760, respectively. The experimental
results suggest that the VAT-based CAD scheme can effectively utilize
meaningful knowledge from unlabeled data to better classify mammographic breast
mass images.

purification provides a method to alleviate these non-idealities, by distilling

dephasing time by a factor of 4, from $3~\rm \mu s$ to $12~\rm\mu s$. These

This results in a total of 640 rules, with a flux attenuation factor ranging

The average value of m$_{cross}$-m$_{src}\approx$-10.25 corresponds to an

chain mobility due to increased monomeric relaxation times. In this study, we
show that translational and segmental dynamics of polymers confined in
disordered packings of nanoparticles can exhibit completely opposite behavior.
We monitor the capillary rise dynamics of entangled polystyrene (PS) in
disordered packings of silica nanoparticles (NPs) of 7 and 27 nm diameter. The
effective viscosity of PS in 27 nm $SiO_2$ NP packings, inferred based on the
Lucas-Washburn equation, is significantly smaller than the bulk viscosity, and
the extent of reduction in the translational motion due to confinement
increases with the molecular weight of PS, reaching 4 orders of magnitude
reduction for PS with a molecular weight of 4M g/mol. The glass transition
temperature of entangled PS in the packings of 27 nm $SiO_2$ NPs, however,
increases by 45 K, indicating significant slowdown of segmental motion.
Interestingly, confinement of the polymers into packings made of 7 nm $SiO_2$
NPs results in molecular weight-independent effective viscosity. The segmental
dynamics of PS in 7 nm $SiO_2$ NP packings are slowed down even further as
evidenced by 65 K increase in glass transition temperature. These seemingly

designing fair decision-making systems due to its compatibility with legal
frameworks, interpretability for human stakeholders, and robustness to spurious
correlations inherent in observational data, among other factors. The recent
attention to causal fairness, however, has been accompanied with great
skepticism due to practical and epistemological challenges with applying
current causal fairness approaches in the literature. Motivated by the
long-standing empirical work on causality in econometrics, social sciences, and
biomedical sciences, in this paper we lay out the conditions for appropriate
application of causal fairness under the ""potential outcomes framework."" We
highlight key aspects of causal inference that are often ignored in the causal
fairness literature. In particular, we discuss the importance of specifying the
nature and timing of interventions on social categories such as race or gender.
Precisely, instead of postulating an intervention on immutable attributes, we
propose a shift in focus to their perceptions and discuss the implications for
fairness evaluation. We argue that such conceptualization of the intervention
is key in evaluating the validity of causal assumptions and conducting sound
causal analysis including avoiding post-treatment bias. Subsequently, we
illustrate how causality can address the limitations of existing fairness
metrics, including those that depend upon statistical correlations.
Specifically, we introduce causal variants of common statistical notions of
fairness, and we make a novel observation that under the causal framework there
is no fundamental disagreement between different notions of fairness. Finally,
we conduct extensive experiments where we demonstrate our approach for

extend this analysis to the 2-norm of the difference between the estimate and
the diagonal of $A$. We prove, discuss and experiment with bounds on the number

attributed to the lower initial quasi-momentum $\bf{k}$ of the excited

converted spectrum. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed

the source speech and target speech can be corrupted by seen or unseen noise
types during the training process. Additionally, both speech quality and

to the controller unit of the drone. In this paper, we propose a localization
scheme for drones called iDROP (Robust Localization for Indoor Navigation of
Drones with Optimized Beacon Placement) that is specifically devised for
GPS-denied environments (e.g., indoor spaces). Instead of GPS signals, iDROP
relies on speaker-generated ultrasonic acoustic signals to enable a drone to
estimate its location. In general, localization error is due to two factors:
the ranging error and the error induced by relative geometry between the
transmitters and the receiver. iDROP mitigates these two types of errors and
provides a high-precision three-dimensional localization scheme for drones.
iDROP employs a waveform that is robust against multi-path fading. Moreover, by
placing beacons in optimal locations, it reduces the localization error induced
by the relative geometry between the transmitters and the receiver.

most metallic systems is the BCS-like electron pairing, strongly correlated
electrons with poor Fermi liquidity can condense into the unconventional
BEC-like pairs. Quantum spin liquids harbor extraordinary spin correlation free
from order and the superconductivity that possibly emerges by carrier doping of
the spin liquids is expected to have a peculiar pairing nature. The present
study experimentally explores the nature of the pairing condensate in a doped

electron-electron Coulombic interactions across the Mott critical value in the

a BCS-like condensate from a Fermi liquid at high pressures. The Nernst-effect

minimum computational latency while preserving practical tracking accuracy to
enable seamless TUI integration in the commercial mxdR-HMD, which has limited
computational resources. We implemented the mxdR-HS on a commercial Microsoft

mxdR-HS had a superior computational latency but marginally lower tracking

computational latency and tracking accuracy than 10 marker-less tracking
methods. Our mxdR-HS, in a medical environment, can be suggested as a visual
guide to display complex volumetric medical imaging data.

can disturb the orbit of a satellite, in particular the eviction-like ones.
Although the inclination is always disturbed while crossing one eviction-like
resonance, capture can only occur when the semi-major axis is decreasing. This
is, for instance, the case of Phobos, the largest satellite of Mars, that will
cross some of these resonances in the future because its orbit is shrinking
owing to tidal effects. We estimate the impact of resonance crossing in the
orbit of the satellite, including the capture probabilities, as a function of
several parameters, such as the eccentricity and the inclination of the
satellite, and the obliquity of the planet. Finally, we use the method of the

realizing continual learning thanks to its ability to handle the
plasticity-stability dilemma. In general, however, the clustering performance
of ART-based algorithms strongly depends on the specification of a similarity
threshold, i.e., a vigilance parameter, which is data-dependent and specified
by hand. This paper proposes an ART-based topological clustering algorithm with
a mechanism that automatically estimates a similarity threshold from the
distribution of data points. In addition, for improving information extraction
performance, a divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm capable of continual
learning is proposed by introducing a hierarchical structure to the proposed
algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has
high clustering performance comparable with recently-proposed state-of-the-art
hierarchical clustering algorithms.

in which spins are strongly correlated and entangled but do not order1, 2;
further intriguing is its doped version, which possibly hosts strange metal and
unconventional superconductivity3. Promising and currently the only candidate
of the doped spin liquid is a triangular-lattice organic conductor,
kappa-(BEDT-TTF)4Hg2.89Br8, recently found to hold metallicity,
spin-liquid-like magnetism and BEC-like superconductivity4-6. The nature of the
metallic state with the spin-liquid behaviour is awaiting to be further
clarified. Here, we report the thermoelectric signature that mobile holes in
the spin liquid background is in a quantum critical state and it pertains to
the BEC-like superconductivity. The Seebeck coefficient divided by temperature,
S/T, is enhanced on cooling with logarithmic divergence indicative of quantum
criticality. Furthermore, the logarithmic enhancement is correlated with the
superconducting transition temperature under pressure variation, and the
temperature and magnetic field profile of S/T upon the superconducting
transition change with pressure in a consistent way with the previously
suggested BEC-BCS crossover. The present results reveal that the quantum
criticality in a doped spin liquid emerges in a phase, not at a point, and is
involved in the unconventional BEC-like nature.

spacetime itself really suffer from such conformal instability? If so, does the
conformal instability cause the collapse of local spacetime region or even
collapse the whole spacetime? The problems are studied in the framework of the
Quantum Spacetime Reference Frame (QSRF) and induced spacetime Ricci flow. We
find that if the lowest eigenvalue of an operator, associated with the
F-functional in a local compact (closed and bounded) region, is positive, the
local region is conformally unstable and will tend to volume-shrinking and
curvature-pinching along the Ricci flow-time t; if the eigenvalue is negative
or zero, the local region is conformally stable up to a trivial rescaling.
However, the local non-collapsing theorem in the Ricci flow proved by Perelman
ensures that the instability will not cause the local compact spacetime region
collapse into nothing. The total effective action is also proved positive
defined and bounded from below keeping the whole spacetime conformally stable,
which can be considered as a generalization of the classical positive mass
theorem of gravitation to the quantum level.

As a mainstream solution, the self-labeling-based methods train the detector on
both labeled data and unlabeled data with pseudo labels predicted by the
detector itself, but their performances are always limited. Through
experimental analysis, we reveal the underlying reason is that the detector is
misguided by the incorrect pseudo labels predicted by itself (dubbed
self-errors). These self-errors can hurt performance even worse than
random-errors, and can be neither discerned nor rectified during the
self-labeling process. In this paper, we propose an effective detection
framework named CrossRectify, to obtain accurate pseudo labels by
simultaneously training two detectors with different initial parameters.
Specifically, the proposed approach leverages the disagreements between
detectors to discern the self-errors and refines the pseudo label quality by
the proposed cross-rectifying mechanism. Extensive experiments show that
CrossRectify achieves outperforming performances over various detector

fractionally spaced prefilter (FSP) per subcarrier for flattening/equalizing
the channel across the subcarrier band, followed by a conventional precoder
whose goal is to concentrate the signals of different users at their spatial
locations. This way, each user receives only the intended information. In this
paper, we take note that channel reciprocity may not hold perfectly in
practical scenarios due to the mismatch of radio chains in uplink and downlink.
Additionally, channel state information (CSI) at the base station may not be
perfectly known. This, together with imperfect channel reciprocity can lead to
detrimental effects on the downlink precoder performance. We theoretically
analyze the performance of the proposed precoder in the presence of imperfect
CSI and channel reciprocity calibration errors. This leads to an effective
method for compensating these effects. Finally, we numerically evaluate the
performance of the proposed precoder. Our results show that the proposed
precoder leads to an excellent performance when benchmarked against OFDM.

only consider single-scale feature representations; and (3) the segmentation
label maps generated by the models are not accurate enough without considering
rich semantic contexts and anatomical textures. In this work, we present
CASTformer, a novel type of adversarial transformers, for 2D medical image
segmentation. First, we take advantage of the pyramid structure to construct
multi-scale representations and handle multi-scale variations. We then design a
novel class-aware transformer module to better learn the discriminative regions
of objects with semantic structures. Lastly, we utilize an adversarial training
strategy that boosts segmentation accuracy and correspondingly allows a
transformer-based discriminator to capture high-level semantically correlated

CASTformer dramatically outperforms previous state-of-the-art transformer-based
approaches on three benchmarks, obtaining 2.54%-5.88% absolute improvements in
Dice over previous models. Further qualitative experiments provide a more
detailed picture of the model's inner workings, shed light on the challenges in
improved transparency, and demonstrate that transfer learning can greatly
improve performance and reduce the size of medical image datasets in training,

The WSM is assumed to be in the equilibrium state and at the neutrality point,
such that the interaction between the atomic charges and the material is fully
described (in the non retarded regime) by axion electrodynamics, which is an
experimentally observable signature of the anomalous Hall effect in the bulk of
the WSM. The atom-WSM interaction provides additional contributions to the
Casimir-Polder potential thus modifying the energy spectra and wave function,
which now became distance dependent. Using variational methods, we solve the
corresponding Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the atomic electron. The ground
state and the polarization are analyzed as a function of the atom-surface

We also study the impact of the medium's permittivity by assuming a hydrogen
atom in vacuum, and a donor impurity in the semiconductors gallium arsenide
(GaAs) and gallium phosphide (GaP). We found that the topological interaction
behaves as an effective-attractive charge so that the electronic cloud tends to

magnetic systems, the displacement of chiral domain walls (DW) and skyrmions
(SK) by Spin Orbit Torques (SOT), is also prone to friction. Chiral damping,
the dissipative counterpart of the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya Interaction (DMI),
plays a central role in these dynamics. Despite experimental observation, and
numerous theoretical studies confirming its existence, the influence of chiral
damping on DW and SK dynamics has remained elusive due to the difficulty of
discriminating from DMI. Here we unveil the effect that chiral damping has on
the flow motion of DWs and SKs driven by current and magnetic field. We use a
static in-plane field to lift the chiral degeneracy. As the in-plane field is
increased, the chiral asymmetry changes sign. When considered separately,
neither DMI nor chiral damping can explain the sign reversal of the asymmetry,
which we prove to be the result of their competing effects. Finally, numerical
modelling unveils the non-linear nature of chiral dissipation and its critical

treatment variable on a long-term outcome variable using data from an
observational domain and an experimental domain. The observational domain is
subject to unobserved confounding. Furthermore, subjects in the experiment are
only followed for a short period of time; hence, long-term effects of treatment
are unobserved but short-term effects will be observed. Therefore, data from
neither domain alone suffices for causal inference about the effect of the
treatment on the long-term outcome, and must be pooled in a principled way,
instead. Athey et al. (2020) proposed a method for systematically combining
such data for identifying the downstream causal effect in view. Their approach
is based on the assumptions of internal and external validity of the
experimental data, and an extra novel assumption called latent
unconfoundedness. In this paper, we first review their proposed approach, and
then we propose three alternative approaches for data fusion for the purpose of
identifying and estimating average treatment effect as well as the effect of
treatment on the treated. Our first approach is based on assuming
equi-confounding bias for the short-term and long-term outcomes. Our second
approach is based on a relaxed version of the equi-confounding bias assumption,
where we assume the existence of an observed confounder such that the
short-term and long-term potential outcome variables have the same partial
additive association with that confounder. Our third approach is based on the
proximal causal inference framework, in which we assume the existence of an
extra variable in the system which is a proxy of the latent confounder of the
treatment-outcome relation. We propose influence function-based estimation
strategies for each of our data fusion frameworks and study the robustness

a novel design element by utilizing the notion of exceptional point

is to build upon ideas from multifidelity uncertainty quantification to
leverage the benefits of both sampling and surrogate modeling, while mitigating
their downsides. In particular, the surrogate model is selected to exploit
problem structure, such as smoothness, and offers a highly correlated
information source to the original nonlinear dynamical system. We utilize an
intrusive generalized Polynomial Chaos surrogate because it avoids any
statistical errors in its construction and provides analytic estimates of
output statistics. We then leverage a Monte Carlo-based Control Variate
technique to correct the bias caused by the surrogate approximation error. The
primary theoretical contribution of this work is the analysis and solution of
an estimator design strategy that optimally balances the computational effort
needed to adapt a surrogate compared with sampling the original expensive
nonlinear system. While previous works have similarly combined surrogates and
sampling, to our best knowledge this work is the first to provide rigorous
analysis of estimator design. We deploy our approach on multiple examples
stemming from the simulation of mechanical automotive propulsion system models.

results show that compared with the methods without an interactive prediction,

to approximate the distribution of LR images given a HR image, previous works
have heavily relied on the unrealistic assumption that the conditional

HR image to a LR image. In this paper, we show that we can improve the
performance of USR models by relaxing the assumption and propose to train the
probabilistic degradation generator. Our probabilistic degradation generator
can be viewed as a deep hierarchical latent variable model and is more suitable
for modeling the complex conditional distribution. We also reveal the notable

triggered by the orbital motion of the small object, which give rise to a
system of inhomogeneous differential equations under the adiabatic
approximation. Such a system of equations is then solved numerically using
Green's function furnished by the solutions of the corresponding homogeneous
equations. To explore the present scenario from an observational perspective,
we investigate how the pertinent observables are dependent on specific
spacetime configurations. In this regard, the energy fluxes and the
gravitational wave dephasing accumulated during the process are evaluated, as
functions of the scalar charge, mass ratio, and spin of the central
supermassive black hole. In particular, the presence of additional scalar
emission leads to a more significant rate of overall energy loss, which, in
turn, decreases the total number of orbital cycles before the small object
plunges into the central black hole. Moreover, for a central black hole with a
higher spin, the imprints of the scalar charge on the resultant gravitational

with dynamic and static representations for social recommendation (GNN-DSR),
which considers both dynamic and static representations of users and items and
incorporates their relational influence. GNN-DSR models the short-term dynamic
and long-term static interactional representations of the user's interest and
the item's attraction, respectively. Furthermore, the attention mechanism is
used to aggregate the social influence of users on the target user and the
correlative items' influence on a given item. The final latent factors of user

inpainting approach that enables users to customize the inpainting result by
their own preference or memory. Specifically, our approach is composed of two
stages that utilize the prior of neural network and user's guidance to jointly
inpaint corrupted images. In the first stage, an autoencoder based on a novel
external spatial attention mechanism is deployed to produce reconstructed
features of the corrupted image and a coarse inpainting result that provides
semantic mask as the medium for user interaction. In the second stage, a
semantic decoder that takes the reconstructed features as prior is adopted to
synthesize a fine inpainting result guided by user's customized semantic mask,
so that the final inpainting result will share the same content with user's
guidance while the textures and colors reconstructed in the first stage are
preserved. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in

infinite-dimensional hard-sphere glass, with two nontrivial exponents
$\theta_f=0.42311...$ and $\gamma=0.41269...$, respectively. While the marginal

capable of supporting ultra-high data rates, albeit at the cost of high
pathloss. Hence they tend to harness high-gain beamforming. Therefore a novel
hybrid 3D beamformer relying on sophisticated sensor-based beam training and
channel estimation is proposed for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)
aided THz MIMO systems. A so-called array-of-subarray based THz BS architecture
is adopted and the corresponding sub-RIS structure is proposed. The BS, RIS and
receiver antenna arrays of the users are all uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The
Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors are integrated into the RIS and the user location
information obtained by the UWB sensors is exploited for channel estimation and
beamforming. Furthermore, the novel concept of a Precise Beamforming Algorithm
(PBA) is proposed, which further improves the beam-forming accuracy by
circumventing the performance limitations imposed by positioning errors.
Moreover, the conditions of maintaining the orthogonality of the RIS-aided THz
channel are derived in support of spatial multiplexing. The closed-form
expressions of the near-field and far-field path-loss are also derived. Our
simulation results show that the proposed scheme accurately estimates the
RIS-aided THz channel and the spectral efficiency is much improved, despite its
low complexity. This makes our solution eminently suitable for delay-sensitive
applications.

computer science and economics, with applications ranging from politics to
machine learning. Much of the work in this area revolves around a simple
algorithm termed \emph{randomized weighted majority} (RWM), also known as
""Hedge"" or ""Multiplicative Weights Update,"" which is well known to achieve
statistically optimal rates in adversarial settings (Littlestone and Warmuth
'94, Freund and Schapire '99). Unfortunately, RWM comes with an inherent
computational barrier: it requires maintaining and sampling from a distribution
over all possible actions. In typical settings of interest the action space is
exponentially large, seemingly rendering RWM useless in practice.
  In this work, we refute this notion for a broad variety of \emph{structured}
games, showing it is possible to efficiently (approximately) sample the action
space in RWM in \emph{polylogarithmic} time. This gives the first efficient
no-regret algorithms for problems such as the \emph{(discrete) Colonel Blotto
game}, \emph{matroid congestion}, \emph{matroid security}, and basic
\emph{dueling games}. As an immediate corollary, we give a polylogarithmic time
meta-algorithm to compute approximate Nash Equilibria for these games that is
exponentially faster than prior methods in several important settings. Further,
our algorithm is the first to efficiently compute equilibria for more involved
variants of these games with general sums, more than two players, and, for
Colonel Blotto, multiple resource types.

both decays the most severe constraints on the $\mu\to e$ LFV processes. It is

functors is formulated as a colax functor $X$ from a small category $I$ to the
2-category $\kdgCat$ of small dg categories, dg functors and dg natural
transformations for a fixed commutative ring $\k$. If $I$ is a group regarded
as a category with only one object $*$, then $X$ is nothing but a colax action
of the group $I$ on the dg category $X(*)$. In this sense, this $X$ can be
regarded as a generalization of a dg category with a colax action of a group.
We define a notion of standard derived equivalence between such colax functors
by generalizing the corresponding notion between dg categories with a group
action. Our first main result gives some characterizations of this notion
without an assumption of $\k$-flatness (or $\k$-projectivity) on $X$, one of
which is given in terms of generalized versions of a tilting object and a
quasi-equivalence. On the other hand, for such a colax functor $X$, the dg
categories $X(i)$ with $i$ objects of $I$ can be glued together to have a
single dg category $\Gr(X)$, called the Grothendieck construction of $X$. % Our
second main result insists that for such colax functors $X$ and $X'$, the
Grothendieck construction $\Gr(X')$ is derived equivalent to $\Gr(X)$ if there
exists a standard derived equivalence from $X'$ to $X$. These results
generalize the main results of \cite{Asa-a} and \cite{Asa-13} to the dg case,
respectively. These are new even for dg categories with a group action. In
particular, the second result gives a new tool to show the derived equivalence
between the orbit categories of dg categories with a group action, which will
be illustrated in some examples.

consider diverse state-of-the-art architectures (ResNets, Transformers) and
training procedures (CLIP, SimCLR, DeiT, Adversarial Training). We find that,
somewhat surprisingly, in ResNets, adversarial training makes models more
sensitive to the background compared to foreground than standard training.
Similarly, contrastively-trained models also have lower relative foreground
sensitivity in both transformers and ResNets. Lastly, we observe intriguing
adaptive abilities of transformers to increase relative foreground sensitivity
as corruption level increases. Using saliency methods, we automatically
discover spurious features that drive the background sensitivity of models and
assess alignment of saliency maps with foregrounds. Finally, we quantitatively

statistical learning for estimating the test error of a model, but its behavior
is not yet fully understood. It has been shown that standard confidence
intervals for test error using estimates from CV may have coverage below
nominal levels. This phenomenon occurs because each sample is used in both the
training and testing procedures during CV and as a result, the CV estimates of
the errors become correlated. Without accounting for this correlation, the
estimate of the variance is smaller than it should be. One way to mitigate this
issue is by estimating the mean squared error of the prediction error instead
using nested CV. This approach has been shown to achieve superior coverage
compared to intervals derived from standard CV. In this work, we generalize the
nested CV idea to the Cox proportional hazards model and explore various
choices of test error for this setting.

been mitigated by containment measures that in different occasions have
resulted in a power-law growth of the number of cases. The first observation of
such behaviour has been obtained from 2020 late spring data coming from China
by Ziff and Ziff in Ref. [1]. After this important observation the power-law
scaling (albeit with different exponents) has also been observed in other
countries during periods of containment of the spread. Early interpretations of
these results suggest that this phenomenon might be due to spatial effects of
the spread. Here we show that temporal modulations of infectivity of
individuals due to containment measures can also cause power-law growth of the
number of cases over time. To this end we propose a stochastic well-mixed
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model of epidemic spreading in presence of
containment measures resulting in time-dependent infectivity and we explore the
statistical properties of the resulting branching process at criticality. We
show that at criticality it is possible to observe power-law growth of the

analytical results are confirmed by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Although
these results do not exclude that spatial effects might be important in
modulating the power-law growth of the number of cases at criticality, this
work shows that even well-mixed populations may already feature non-trivial

introduce a new environment that allows ML predictors to use active learning

quality that users experience -- i.e. the accuracy of the predictor selected by
each user -- can decrease even as the individual predictors get better. We show
that this phenomenon naturally arises due to a trade-off whereby competition
pushes each predictor to specialize in a subset of the population while data
purchase has the effect of making predictors more uniform. We support our

top with $p$-orbital character, while the conduction band bottom exhibits

energy-gap along the [0001] direction is associated with the $\Delta_1$
symmetry, and connects across the band gap at the $\Gamma$ point in 2D
Brillouin zones. This feature enables spin filtering and may result in a large
tunnelling magnetoresistance. In general, we find that Co-based junctions
present limited spin filtering and little magnetoresistance at low bias, since
both spin sub-bands cross the Fermi level with $\Delta_1$ symmetry. This
contrasts the situation of Fe, where only the minority $\Delta_1$ band is

magnetoresistance at low bias remains relatively small, mostly due to
conduction away from the $\Gamma$ point and through complex bands with symmetry

to the relativistic domain. In the spirit of spin separation, relativistic
effects are treated in two steps: scalar relativity is treated by the
infinite-order, spin-free part of the exact two-component (X2C) relativistic
Hamiltonian, whereas spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is treated by the first-order,
Douglas-Kroll-Hess-like SOC operator derived from the same X2C Hamiltonian. Two
possible combinations of iCIPT2 with SOC are considered, i.e., SOiCI and iCISO.
The former treats SOC and electron correlation on an equal footing, whereas the
latter treats SOC in the spirit of state interaction, by constructing and
diagonalizing an effective spin-orbit Hamiltonian matrix in a small number of
correlated scalar states. Both double group and time reversal symmetries are
incorporated to simplify the computation. Pilot applications reveal that SOiCI
is very accurate for the spin-orbit splitting (SOS) of heavy atoms, whereas the
computationally very cheap iCISO can safely be applied to the SOS of light
atoms and even of systems containing heavy atoms when SOC is largely quenched

at magic angles, which can be well described by the effective continuum model
derived by Bistritzer and MacDonald (BM). We propose in this paper a similar
twisted bilayer system but defined on the square lattice with $\pi$-flux per
plaquette, and study its spectrum using the BM Hamiltonian with a mass term
which is originated from the staggered potential. The basic difference between
the TBG and the present model is simply rotational symmetry, $C_3$ vs $C_4$, as
well as a mass term. Nevertheless, the feature of the flat bands is quite
different: Those of the TBG appear at magic angles only, while the present
model shows many flat bands, which are reminiscent of Landau levels, quite
stably at any angles even in the absence of a magnetic field other than
$\pi$-flux which keeps time reversal (TR) symmetry. Moreover, flat bands emerge
in the mass gap of the Dirac spectrum, and each state composing these flat
bands is well-localized at the position forming the moir\'e lattice. It turns
out that the moir\'e potential serves as a periodic magnetic field, which can
give energies smaller that the gap around moir\'e lattice positions. We derive
a local Hamiltonian valid around the moir\'e lattice sites and show that it
indeed reproduces the energies of the flat bands within the mass gap. Since
these mid-gap states are localized at the moir\'e lattice, they form degenerate
levels, which may be referred to as moir\'e Landau levels, although the
mechanism of degeneracies are different from the conventional Landau levels.
Interestingly, doubled fermions of the BH Hamiltonian associated with two
layers have opposite charges when they couple with the effective moir\'e
magnetic filed, which concern TR symmetry.

defined as $\gamma(D)= \max_{H \subseteq D, |V(H)| >1} \frac {|A(H)|}
{|V(H)|-1}$. Frank in [Covering branching, Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum
(Szeged) 41 (1979), 77-81] proved that a digraph $D$ decomposes into $k$
branchings, if and only if $\Delta^{-}(D) \leq k$ and $\gamma(D) \leq k$.
  In this paper, we study digraph analogues for the Nine Dragon Tree
Conjecture. We conjecture that, for positive integers $k$ and $d$, if $D$ is a
digraph with $\gamma(D) \leq k + \frac{d-k}{d+1}$ and $\Delta^{-}(D) \leq k+1$,
then $D$ decomposes into $k + 1$ branchings $B_{1}, \ldots, B_{k}, B_{k+1}$
with $\Delta^{+}(B_{k+1}) \leq d$. This conjecture, if true, is a refinement of
Frank's characterization. A series of acyclic bipartite digraphs is also
presented to show the bound of $\gamma(D)$ given in the conjecture is best
possible.
  We prove our conjecture for the cases $d \leq k$. As more evidence to support
our conjecture, we prove that if $D$ is a digraph with the maximum average
degree $mad(D)$ $\leq$ $2k + \frac{2(d-k)}{d+1}$ and $\Delta^{-}(D) \leq k+1$,
then $D$ decomposes into $k + 1$ pseudo-branchings $C_{1}, \ldots, C_{k},
C_{k+1}$ with $\Delta^{+}(C_{k+1}) \leq d$.

However, most existing end-to-end ASR methods neglect the use of specific

promotion relationship between Pinyin and Character where Chinese characters
can be romanized by Pinyin. Based on the above intuition, we first investigate
types of end-to-end encoder-decoder based models in the single-input
dual-output (SIDO) multi-task framework, after which a novel asynchronous
decoding with fuzzy Pinyin sampling method is proposed according to the
one-to-one correspondence characteristics between Pinyin and Character.
Furthermore, we proposed a two-stage training strategy to make training more
stable and converge faster. The results on the test sets of AISHELL-1 dataset
show that the proposed enhanced dual-decoder model without a language model is
improved by a big margin compared to strong baseline models.

emitted, the analytical expression of the laser output power is deduced, and
the law of the laser output power changing with the laser parameters is
obtained. By fitting and comparing with the experimental results, the new model

communication efficiency while guaranteeing intelligent task performance.
Different from conventional communications systems, the resource allocation in
semantic communications no longer just pursues the bit transmission rate, but
focuses on how to better compress and transmit semantic to complete subsequent
intelligent tasks. This paper aims to appropriately allocate the bandwidth and
power for artificial intelligence (AI) task-oriented semantic communication and
proposes a joint compressiom ratio and resource allocation (CRRA) algorithm. We
first analyze the relationship between the AI task's performance and the
semantic information. Then, to optimize the AI task's perfomance under resource
constraints, a bandwidth and power allocation problem is formulated. The
problem is first separated into two subproblems due to the non-convexity. The
first subproblem is a compression ratio optimization problem with a given
resource allocation scheme, which is solved by a enumeration algorithm. The
second subproblem is to find the optimal resource allocation scheme, which is
transformed into a convex problem by successive convex approximation method,
and solved by a convex optimization method. The optimal semantic compression
ratio and resource allocation scheme are obtained by iteratively solving these
two subproblems. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can
efficiently improve the AI task's performance by up to 30\% comprared with
baselines.

models for multiple datasets. Recent works show that the best model structure
is related to the dataset used, and one single model cannot adapt to all tasks.
In this paper, we propose an automated Question-Answering framework, which
could automatically adjust network architecture for multiple datasets. Our
framework is based on an innovative evolution algorithm, which is stable and
suitable for multiple dataset scenario. The evolution algorithm for search
combine prior knowledge into initial population and use a performance estimator
to avoid inefficient mutation by predicting the performance of candidate model
architecture. The prior knowledge used in initial population could improve the
final result of the evolution algorithm. The performance estimator could
quickly filter out models with bad performance in population as the number of
trials increases, to speed up the convergence. Our framework achieves 78.9 EM
and 86.1 F1 on SQuAD 1.1, 69.9 EM and 72.5 F1 on SQuAD 2.0. On NewsQA dataset,

chromaticity due to the coupling between the sky and the instrument. This
coupling is sourced by the instrument primary beam; therefore it is important
to know the beam to extremely high precision. Here we demonstrate how known
beam uncertainties can be characterized using databases of beam models. In this
introductory work, we focus on beam errors arising from physically offset
and/or broken antennas within a station. We use the public code OSKAR to
generate an ""ideal"" SKA beam formed from 256 antennas regularly-spaced in a
35-m circle, as well as a large database of ""perturbed"" beams sampling
distributions of broken/offset antennas. We decompose the beam errors (""ideal""
minus ""perturbed"") using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel PCA
(KPCA). Using 20 components, we find that PCA/KPCA can reduce the residual of
the beam in our datasets by 60-90% compared with the assumption of an ideal
beam. Using a simulated observation of the cosmic signal plus foregrounds, we
find that assuming the ideal beam can result in 1% error in the EoR window and
10% in the wedge of the 2D power spectrum. When PCA/KPCA is used to
characterize the beam uncertainties, the error in the power spectrum shrinks to
below 0.01% in the EoR window and <1% in the wedge. Our framework can be used

low-latency time-domain encoder with a small stride leads to an extremely long

SkiM achieves on par or even better separation performance than DPRNN.
Meanwhile, the computational cost of SkiM is reduced by 75% compared to DPRNN.
The strong long sequence modeling capability and low computational cost make
SkiM a suitable model for online CSS applications. Our fastest real-time model
gets 17.1 dB signal-to-distortion (SDR) improvement with less than

transformers (ViTs), since it provides a flexible and powerful way to model
spatial relationships. However, is the attention mechanism truly an
indispensable part of ViT? Can it be replaced by some other alternatives? To
demystify the role of attention mechanism, we simplify it into an extremely
simple case: ZERO FLOP and ZERO parameter. Concretely, we revisit the shift
operation. It does not contain any parameter or arithmetic calculation. The
only operation is to exchange a small portion of the channels between
neighboring features. Based on this simple operation, we construct a new
backbone network, namely ShiftViT, where the attention layers in ViT are
substituted by shift operations. Surprisingly, ShiftViT works quite well in
several mainstream tasks, e.g., classification, detection, and segmentation.
The performance is on par with or even better than the strong baseline Swin
Transformer. These results suggest that the attention mechanism might not be
the vital factor that makes ViT successful. It can be even replaced by a
zero-parameter operation. We should pay more attentions to the remaining parts
of ViT in the future work. Code is available at github.com/microsoft/SPACH.

exploration strategy, yet it is experimentally shown to greatly improve the

similar effects and then use the groups in a bi-level epsilon greedy
exploration hierarchy for action selection. We argue that SEG facilitates
semantic exploration by exploring in the space of groups of actions, which have
richer semantic meanings than atomic actions. Experiments show that QMIX(SEG)
largely outperforms QMIX and leads to strong performance competitive with

concepts during lectures. Besides physics, PI has also been adopted in other
STEM fields. In this approach, students answer a related question individually
after a concept has been presented. Before they revote on the same question
individually, they are asked to convince others their answer is correct during
peer discussion. The percentage of correct answer typically increased after
peer discussion. However, Smith et al. highlighted that the improvement may be
due to copying, not because students actually learned how to reason correctly.
To exclude copying, Smith et al. modified Mazur's PI protocol by adding a
second question Q2 after the students revote on the first question Q1. Q2 is
'isomorphic' to Q1, meaning that it requires the application of the same
concept but the 'cover story' is different. The answer to Q1 is not revealed
until after the individual vote on Q2. Here, we simplify Smith et al.'s PI

Using the coherent quantum noise cancellation (CQNC) process, one can eliminate
the back action noise at all frequencies. Also by tuning the OPA parameters,
one can suppress the quantum shot-noise at lower frequencies than the resonant
frequency. In the CQNC scheme, the damping rate of the mechanical oscillator
matches the damping rate of the atomic ensemble, which is experimentally
achievable even for a low-frequency mechanical oscillator with a high-quality
factor. Elimination of the back action noise and suppression of the shot noise
significantly enhance force sensing and thus overcome the standard quantum

of the observer, some neutrino events might be detected not only from the class
of Novae recently detected in the GeV $\gamma$-rays by the {\it Fermi}-LAT

energy dissipation rate from spacecraft observations in order to address
diverse problems related, e.g., to heating of the solar wind (SW) and
magnetospheric plasmas. Here we use various $1024^3$ direct numerical
simulation (DNS) data of free-decay isothermal CHMHD turbulence obtained with
the GHOST code (Geophysical High-Order Suite for Turbulence) to analyze two of
the recently derived exact laws. The simulations reflect different intensities
of the initial Mach number and the background magnetic field. The analysis
demonstrates the equivalence of the two laws in the inertial range and relates
the strength of the Hall effect to the amplitude of the cascade rate at sub-ion
scales. When taken in their general form (i.e., not limited to the inertial
range) some subtleties regarding the validity of the stationarity assumption or
the absence of the forcing in the simulations are discussed. We show that the
free-decay nature of the turbulence induces a shift from a large scale forcing
towards the presence of a scale-dependent reservoir of energy fueling the
cascade or dissipation. The reduced form of the exact laws (valid in the
inertial range) ultimately holds even if the stationarity assumption is not

K^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$. Its key component, the $B_s\to K$ transition form factor
$f^{B_s\to K}_+(q^2)$, is studied within the QCD light-cone sum rules approach
by using a chiral correlator. The derived $f^{B_s\to K}_+(q^2)$ is dominated by
the leading-twist part, and to improve its precision, we construct a new model
for the kaon leading-twist distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;K}(x,\mu)$, whose
parameters are fixed by using the least squares method with the help of the
moments calculated by using the QCD sum rules within the background field
theory. The first four moments at the initial scale $\mu_0 = 1~{\rm GeV}$ are,
$\langle \xi^1\rangle _{2;K} = -0.0438^{+0.0053}_{-0.0075}$, $\langle
\xi^2\rangle _{2;K} = 0.262 \pm 0.010$, $\langle \xi^3\rangle _{2;K} =
-0.0210^{+0.0024}_{-0.0035}$ and $\langle \xi^4\rangle _{2;K} = 0.132 \pm

$a^{2;K}_1 = -0.0731^{+0.0089}_{-0.0124}$, $a^{2;K}_2 =
0.182^{+0.029}_{-0.030}$, $a^{2;K}_3 = -0.0114^{+0.0008}_{-0.0016}$ and
$a^{2;K}_4 = 0.041^{-0.003}_{+0.005}$, respectively. At the large recoil
region, we obtain $f^{B_s\to K} _+ (0) = 0.270^{+0.022}_{-0.030}$. By
extrapolating $f^{B_s\to K}_+(q^2)$ to all the physical allowable region, we
obtain a $|V_{ub}|$-independent decay width for the semileptonic decay
$B_s^0\to K^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$, $5.626^{+1.271}_{-0.864} \times 10^{-12}\ {\rm

inverse problems. A great advantage of the EKI's ensemble approach is that
derivatives are not required in its implementation. But theoretically speaking,
EKI's ensemble size needs to surpass the dimension of the problem. This is
because of EKI's ""subspace property"", i.e., that the EKI solution is a linear
combination of the initial ensemble it starts off with. We show that the
ensemble can break out of this initial subspace when ""localization"" is applied.
In essence, localization enforces an assumed correlation structure onto the
problem, and is heavily used in ensemble Kalman filtering and data
assimilation. We describe and analyze how to apply localization to the EKI, and
how localization helps the EKI ensemble break out of the initial subspace.
Specifically, we show that the localized EKI (LEKI) ensemble will collapse to a
single point (as intended) and that the LEKI ensemble mean will converge to the
global optimum at a sublinear rate. Under strict assumptions on the
localization procedure and observation process, we further show that the data
misfit decays uniformly. We illustrate our ideas and theoretical developments
with numerical examples with simplified toy problems, a Lorenz model, and an
inversion of electromagnetic data, where some of our mathematical assumptions
may only be approximately valid.

  (ICC 2022), Copyright 2022 IEEE",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  One of the core envisions of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks is
to accumulate artificial intelligence (AI) for autonomous controlling of the
Internet of Everything (IoE). Particularly, the quality of IoE services
delivery must be maintained by analyzing contextual metrics of IoE such as
people, data, process, and things. However, the challenges incorporate when the
AI model conceives a lake of interpretation and intuition to the network
service provider. Therefore, this paper provides an explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) framework for quality-aware IoE service delivery that
enables both intelligence and interpretation. First, a problem of quality-aware
IoE service delivery is formulated by taking into account network dynamics and
contextual metrics of IoE, where the objective is to maximize the channel
quality index (CQI) of each IoE service user. Second, a regression problem is
devised to solve the formulated problem, where explainable coefficients of the
contextual matrices are estimated by Shapley value interpretation. Third, the
XAI-enabled quality-aware IoE service delivery algorithm is implemented by
employing ensemble-based regression models for ensuring the interpretation of
contextual relationships among the matrices to reconfigure network parameters.
Finally, the experiment results show that the uplink improvement rate becomes
42.43% and 16.32% for the AdaBoost and Extra Trees, respectively, while the
downlink improvement rate reaches up to 28.57% and 14.29%. However, the
AdaBoost-based approach cannot maintain the CQI of IoE service users.
Therefore, the proposed Extra Trees-based regression model shows significant
performance gain for mitigating the trade-off between accuracy and
interpretability than other baselines.

within a domain $\Omega$, we look for a piecewise adaptive approximation to
$f$. We are interested in an explicit and global (smooth) approach. Bivariate
approximation techniques, as trigonometric or splines approximations, achieve
reduced approximation orders near the boundary of the domain and near curves of
jump singularities of the function or its derivatives. Whereas the boundary of
$\Omega$ is assumed to be known, the subdivision of $\Omega$ to subdomains on
which $f$ is smooth is unknown. The first challenge of the proposed
approximation algorithm would be to find a good approximation to the curves
separating the smooth subdomains of $f$. In the second stage, we simultaneously
look for approximations to the different smooth segments of $f$, where on each
segment we approximate the function by a linear combination of basis functions
$\{p_i\}_{i=1}^M$, considering the corresponding cell-averages. A discrete
Laplacian operator applied to the given cell-average data intensifies the
structure of the singularity of the data across the curves separating the
smooth subdomains of $f$. We refer to these derived values as the signature of
the data, and we use it for both approximating the singularity curves
separating the different smooth regions of $f$. The main contributions here are
improved convergence rates to both the approximation of the singularity curves
and the approximation of $f$, an explicit and global formula, and, in
particular, the derivation of a piecewise smooth high order approximation to
the function.

prevalent model in theoretical computer science, notably as a framework for
reactive synthesis.
  Optimal strategies may require randomisation when dealing with inherently
probabilistic goals, balancing multiple objectives, or in contexts of partial
information. There is no unique way to define randomised strategies. For
instance, one can use so-called mixed strategies or behavioural ones. In the
most general settings, these two classes do not share the same expressiveness.
A seminal result in game theory - Kuhn's theorem - asserts their equivalence in
games of perfect recall.
  This result crucially relies on the possibility for strategies to use
infinite memory, i.e., unlimited knowledge of all past observations. However,
computer systems are finite in practice. Hence it is pertinent to restrict our
attention to finite-memory strategies, defined as automata with outputs.
Randomisation can be implemented in these in different ways: the
initialisation, outputs or transitions can be randomised or deterministic
respectively. Depending on which aspects are randomised, the expressiveness of
the corresponding class of finite-memory strategies differs.
  In this work, we study two-player turn-based stochastic games and provide a
complete taxonomy of the classes of finite-memory strategies obtained by
varying which of the three aforementioned components are randomised. Our
taxonomy holds both in settings of perfect and imperfect information, and in
games with more than two players.

is used to explicitly incorporate data-based statistical information of
renewable forecasts into the supply/demand decisions in the DA market. We
evaluate the conservativeness of bidding strategies distinguished by different
risk aversion settings. In the RT market, a bi-level time-varying optimization
problem is proposed to design the online incentive signals to tradeoff the RT
imbalance penalty for distribution system operators (DSOs) and the costs of
individual DER-owners. This enables tracking their optimal dispatch to provide
fast balancing services, in the presence of time-varying network states while
satisfying the voltage regulation requirement. Simulation results on both DA

two-stage design, and its robustness to uncertainties, the performance of
convergence, the tracking ability, and the feasibility of the resulting network
operations.

Duplex (FDD) massive MIMO has been a formidable challenge. In this paper, we
address this problem with a novel CSI feedback framework enabled by the partial
reciprocity of uplink and downlink channels in the wideband regime. We first
derive the closed-form expression of the rank of the wideband massive MIMO
channel covariance matrix for a given angle-delay distribution. A low-rankness
property is identified, which generalizes the well-known result of the
narrow-band uniform linear array setting. Then we propose a partial channel
reciprocity (PCR) codebook, inspired by the low-rankness behavior and the fact
that the uplink and downlink channels have similar angle-delay distributions.
Compared to the latest codebook in 5G, the proposed PCR codebook scheme
achieves higher performance, lower complexity at the user side, and requires a
smaller amount of feedback. We derive the feedback overhead necessary to
achieve asymptotically error-free CSI feedback. Two low-complexity alternatives
are also proposed to further reduce the complexity at the base station side.
Simulations with the practical 3GPP channel model show the significant gains
over the latest 5G codebook, which prove that our proposed methods are
practical solutions for 5G and beyond.

understanding, and the monocular-based methods can serve as an economical
alternative to the stereo-based or LiDAR-based methods. However, accurately
detecting objects in the 3D space from a single image is extremely difficult
due to the lack of spatial cues. To mitigate this issue, we propose a simple
and effective scheme to introduce the spatial information from LiDAR signals to
the monocular 3D detectors, without introducing any extra cost in the inference
phase. In particular, we first project the LiDAR signals into the image plane
and align them with the RGB images. After that, we use the resulting data to
train a 3D detector (LiDAR Net) with the same architecture as the baseline
model. Finally, this LiDAR Net can serve as the teacher to transfer the learned
knowledge to the baseline model. Experimental results show that the proposed
method can significantly boost the performance of the baseline model and ranks
the $1^{st}$ place among all monocular-based methods on the KITTI benchmark.
Besides, extensive ablation studies are conducted, which further prove the
effectiveness of each part of our designs and illustrate what the baseline
model has learned from the LiDAR Net. Our code will be released at

while partially relying on a common, untrusted third-party, e.g., a Cloud
Storage Provider (CSP). Although users can rely on a secure peer-to-peer (P2P)
channel for file sharing, this introduces potential delay on the data transfer
and requires the sender to remain active and connected while the transfer
process occurs. Instead of using the P2P channel for the entire file, users can
upload information about the file on a common CSP and share only the essential
information that enables the receiver to download and recover the original
file. This paper introduces Bifrost, an innovative file sharing system inspired
by recent results on dual deduplication. Bifrost achieves the desired
functionality and simultaneously guarantees that (1) the CSP can efficiently
compress outsourced data; (2) the secure P2P channel is used only to transmit
short, but crucial information; (3) users can check for data integrity, i.e.,
detect if the CSP alters the outsourced data; and (4) only the sender (data
owner) and the intended receiver can access the file after sharing, i.e., the
cloud or no malicious adversary can infer useful information about the shared
file. We analyze compression and bandwidth performance using a proof-of-concept
implementation. Our experiments show that secure file sharing can be achieved
by sending only 650 bits on the P2P channel, irrespective of file size, while
the CSP that aids the sharing can enjoy a compression rate of 86.9 %.

of geometric phases, which rely on interference, we show that the anisotropy of
the magnetoconductance, measured at different directions of an external

weak links in which the Rashba interaction is caused by an external electric
field, but our method is expected to apply also for other forms of the
spin-orbit coupling. Measuring this magnetoconductance anisotropy thus allows
calibrating Rashba spintronic devices by an external electric field that tunes
the spin-orbit interaction.

learning models can result in biased outcomes. The biased learned models
usually replicate historical discrimination in society and typically negatively
affect the less represented identities. Robots are equipped with these models
that allow them to operate, performing tasks more complex every day. The
learning process consists of different stages depending on human judgments.
Moreover, the resulting learned models for robot decisions rely on recorded
labeled data or demonstrations. Therefore, the robot learning process is
susceptible to bias linked to human behavior in society. This imposes a
potential danger, especially when robots operate around humans and the learning
process can reflect the social unfairness present today. Different feminist
proposals study social inequality and provide essential perspectives towards
removing bias in various fields. What is more, feminism allowed and still
allows to reconfigure numerous social dynamics and stereotypes advocating for
equality across people through their diversity. Consequently, we provide a
feminist perspective on the robot learning process in this work. We base our
discussion on intersectional feminism, community feminism, decolonial feminism,
and pedagogy perspectives, and we frame our work in a feminist robotics
approach. In this paper, we present an initial discussion to emphasize the

extensions can be obtained from the non-relativistic expansion of Lorentz
transformation of Maxwell's equations. The explicit expression for the
parameter $\alpha$ in the extended Hertz-form equations can be derived from
such a non-relativistic expansion. The extended Hertz-form equations, which do
not preserve Galilean invariance, origin from Lorentz transformation of
Maxwell's equations and differ from the Galilean-transformed Maxwell equations
(the original Hertz equations) by the relative sign differences between the two
$\alpha$ terms etc. Especially, the $\alpha$ parameter is of relativistic
origin. The superluminal behavior illustrated by the D'Alembert equation from
the extended Hertz-form equations should be removed by including all subleading
contributions in the $v/c$ expansion, although such a superluminal behavior
will not occur in the vacuum because $\alpha=0$. We should note that in the
Hertz form and extended Hertz form equations, the electromagnetic fields should
take the forms $ \vec{\mathcal{E}}(x)=\vec{E}(\Lambda^{-1}x)$ and $
\vec{\mathcal{B}}(x)=\vec{B}(\Lambda^{-1}x)$. Such a choice of description for
the fields is different from the ordinary one with $\vec{E}(x)$ and
$\vec{B}(x)$, which are well known to satisfy the ordinary Maxwell's equations.
The descriptions of electromagnetic phenomena using the function set
$\{\vec{\mathcal{E}}(x),\vec{\mathcal{B}}(x)\}$ and the function set

control of engineering systems. The reconstruction of the temperature field
from limited observation plays a crucial role in thermal management for
electronic equipment. Deep learning has been employed in physical field
reconstruction, whereas the accurate estimation for the regions with large
gradients is still diffcult. To solve the problem, this work proposes a novel
deep learning method based on patchwise training to reconstruct the temperature
field of electronic equipment accurately from limited observation. Firstly, the
temperature field reconstruction (TFR) problem of the electronic equipment is
modeled mathematically and transformed as an image-to-image regression task.
Then a patchwise training and inference framework consisting of an adaptive
UNet and a shallow multilayer perceptron (MLP) is developed to establish the
mapping from the observation to the temperature field. The adaptive UNet is
utilized to reconstruct the whole temperature field while the MLP is designed
to predict the patches with large temperature gradients. Experiments employing
finite element simulation data are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the
proposed method. Furthermore, the generalization is evaluated by investigating
cases under different heat source layouts, different power intensities, and
different observation point locations. The maximum absolute errors of the
reconstructed temperature field are less than 1K under the patchwise training
approach.

form of $ \log {\it f}= 0.75 \log T_{90} +0.92 \log F -7.14$. Based on this

  We investigate iCOMs formation on the icy surfaces by means of computational
quantum mechanical methods. In particular, we study the coupling and direct
hydrogen abstraction reactions involving the CH$_3$ + X systems (X = NH$_2$,
CH$_3$, HCO, CH$_3$O, CH$_2$OH) and HCO + Y (Y = HCO, CH$_3$O, CH$_2$OH), plus
the CH$_2$OH + CH$_2$OH and CH$_3$O + CH$_3$O systems.
  We computed the activation energy barriers of these reactions as well as the
binding energies of all the studied radicals, by means of density functional

with radical--radical couplings, while in others they may contain large
activation energies. Specifically, we found that (i) ethane, methylamine and
ethylene glycol are the only possible products of the relevant radical--radical

the situation where the bosons reside on a semi-infinite line and interact with

position-dependent coupling strength that makes the system scale invariant. We
show that, for sufficiently attractive interaction, the bosons are bound
together and a new energy scale emerges. This energy scale breaks continuous
scale invariance to discrete scale invariance and leads to the onset of a
geometric sequence of two-body bound states. We also study the two-body
scattering off the boundary and derive the exact reflection amplitude that
exhibits a log-periodicity. This article is intended for students and

the theory of Dommaschk potentials, and describes a configuration with a
central region of nested flux surfaces, surrounded by a chain of magnetic

Therefore, improving the performance of rPPG in complex environment has become

embeds each facial video sequence into a feature map referred to as Multi-scale
Adaptive Spatial and Temporal Map with Overlap (MAST_Mop), which contains not

region such that the difference of the two channels leads to adaptive noise
cancellation. Our approach significantly outperforms all current

various software engineering tasks such as test generation, bug finding and
automated debugging, but developers rarely write them. Techniques that infer
specifications from code exist to fill this gap, but they are designed to
support specific kinds of assertions and are difficult to adapt to support
different assertion languages, e.g., to add support for quantification, or
additional comparison operators, such as membership or containment.
  To address the above issue, we present SpecFuzzer, a novel technique that
combines grammar-based fuzzing, dynamic invariant detection, and mutation
analysis, to automatically produce class specifications. SpecFuzzer uses: (i) a
fuzzer as a generator of candidate assertions derived from a grammar that is
automatically obtained from the class definition; (ii) a dynamic invariant
detector -- Daikon -- to filter out assertions invalidated by a test suite; and
(iii) a mutation-based mechanism to cluster and rank assertions, so that
similar constraints are grouped and then the stronger prioritized.
Grammar-based fuzzing enables SpecFuzzer to be straightforwardly adapted to
support different specification languages, by manipulating the fuzzing grammar,
e.g., to include additional operators.
  We evaluate our technique on a benchmark of 43 Java methods employed in the
evaluation of the state-of-the-art techniques GAssert and EvoSpex. Our results
show that SpecFuzzer can easily support a more expressive assertion language,
over which is more effective than GAssert and EvoSpex in inferring

the enumerative geometry of curves on holomorphic symplectic 4-folds. The
invariants are analogous to the BPS counts of Gopakumar and Vafa for Calabi-Yau
3-folds, Klemm and Pandharipande for Calabi-Yau 4-folds, Pandharipande and
Zinger for Calabi-Yau 5-folds.
  We conjecture that our invariants are integers and give a sheaf-theoretic
interpretation in terms of reduced $4$-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants
of one-dimensional stable sheaves. We check our conjectures for the product of
two $K3$ surfaces and for the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{P}^2$. Modulo the
conjectural holomorphic anomaly equation, we compute our invariants also for
the Hilbert scheme of two points on a $K3$ surface. This yields a conjectural
formula for the number of isolated genus $2$ curves of minimal degree on a very
general hyperk\""ahler $4$-fold of $K3^{[2]}$-type. The formula may be viewed as
a $4$-dimensional analogue of the classical Yau-Zaslow formula concerning
counts of rational curves on $K3$ surfaces.
  In the course of our computations, we also derive a new closed formula for
the Fujiki constants of the Chern classes of tangent bundles of both Hilbert
schemes of points on $K3$ surfaces and generalized Kummer varieties.

with low computational cost and energy efficiency are required. From such
demands, various efficient neural network paradigms, such as spiking neural
networks (SNNs) or binary neural networks (BNNs), have been proposed. However,
they have sticky drawbacks, such as degraded inference accuracy and latency. To
solve these problems, we propose a single-step spiking neural network
(S$^3$NN), an energy-efficient neural network with low computational cost and
high precision. The proposed S$^3$NN processes the information between hidden
layers by spikes as SNNs. Nevertheless, it has no temporal dimension so that
there is no latency within training and inference phases as BNNs. Thus, the
proposed S$^3$NN has a lower computational cost than SNNs that require
time-series processing. However, S$^3$NN cannot adopt na\""{i}ve backpropagation
algorithms due to the non-differentiability nature of spikes. We deduce a
suitable neuron model by reducing the surrogate gradient for multi-time step
SNNs to a single-time step. We experimentally demonstrated that the obtained
surrogate gradient allows S$^3$NN to be trained appropriately. We also showed
that the proposed S$^3$NN could achieve comparable accuracy to full-precision
networks while being highly energy-efficient.

buffers. In a second step, we interpret these off-screen buffers as regular
heightfields that can be rendered efficiently with ray casting using a simple

organization inside biological cells. However, despite the clear relevance to
virtually all physiological functions, we understand surprisingly little about
what phases form in a system of many interacting components, like in cells.
Here, we introduce a new numerical method based on physical relaxation dynamics
to study the coexisting phases in such systems. We use our approach to optimize
interactions between components, similar to how evolution might have optimized
the interactions of proteins. These evolved interactions robustly lead to a
defined number of phases, despite substantial uncertainties in the initial
composition, while random or designed interactions perform much worse.
Moreover, the optimized interactions are robust to perturbations and they allow
fast adaption to new target phase counts. We thus show that genetically encoded
interactions of proteins provide versatile control of phase behavior. The
phases forming in our system are also a concrete example of a robust emergent
property that does not rely on fine-tuning the parameters of individual
constituents.

holes (SMBHs) in galaxy clusters. While the presence of central SMBHs in
galaxies is firmly established, recent work from high-resolution simulations
predict the existence of an additional population of wandering SMBHs. Though
the masses of these SMBHs are a minor perturbation on the larger scale and
individual galaxy scale dark matter components in the cluster, they can impact
statistical lensing properties and individual lensed image configurations.
Probing for these potentially observable signatures, we find that SMBHs imprint
detectable signatures in rare, higher-order strong lensing image configurations
although they do not manifest any statistically significant detectable evidence
in either the magnification distribution or the integrated shear profile.
Investigating specific lensed image geometries, we report that a massive, near
point-like, potential of an SMBH causes the following detectable effects: (i)
image splitting leading to the generation of extra images; (ii) positional and
magnification asymmetries in multiply imaged systems; and (iii) the apparent
disappearance of a lensed counter-image. Of these, image splitting inside the
cluster tangential critical curve, is the most prevalent notable observational
signature. We demonstrate these possibilities in two cases of observed giant
arcs in $SGAS\,J003341.5+024217$ and $RX\,J1347.5-1145$, wherein specific image
configurations seen can be reproduced with SMBHs. Future observations with
high-resolution instrumentation (e.g. MAVIS-Very Large Telescope,
MICADO-Extremely Large Telescope, and the upgraded ngVLA, along with data from
the \textit{Euclid} \& \textit{Nancy Grace Roman} Space Telescopes and the

characterization by combining the first-generation TDI channels from Michelson

suitable band gap for electronic, optoelectronic, and even spintronic devices.
To tailor its properties for such applications, strain engineering may be
adopted. However, such 2D crystals may prefer to exist in the rippled form due
to the instability of long-range orders, and rippling has been shown to have a
contrasting, significant impact on the electronic properties of various 2D
materials, which complicates the tuning process. Hence, the effects of rippling
on the electronic properties of antimonene under strain are herein investigated
by comparing antimonene in its rippled and flat forms. DFT calculations are
performed to compute the structural and electronic parameters, where uniaxial
compression of up to 7.5% is applied along the armchair and zigzag directions
to study the anisotropic behavior of the material. Highly stable properties
such as the work function and band gap are obtained for the rippled structures,
where they are fully relaxed, regardless of the compression level, and these
properties do not deviate much from those of the pristine structure under no
strain. In contrast, various changes are observed in their flat counterparts.
The mechanisms behind the different results are thoroughly explained by
analyses of the density of states and structure geometry. The out-of-plane
dipole moments of the rippled structures are also presented to give further
insights into potential applications of rippled antimonene in sensors,
actuators, triboelectric nanogenerators, etc. This work presents extensive data
and thorough analysis on the effect of rippling on antimonene. The
identification of optimal ripple amplitudes for which the electronic properties
of the pristine condition can be recovered will be highly significant in
guiding the rational design and architecture of antimonene-based devices.

decay experiment located at the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de Canfranc (LSC,
Spain). Its aim is to demonstrate that the neutrino is a Majorana particle by
detecting the neutrinoless double beta decay process in xenon gas enriched in
the $^{136}$Xe isotope. The detector technology used in NEXT is that of
radiopure high pressure time projection chambers with electroluminescence
amplification, which provide excellent energy resolution better than 1$\%$ FWHM
in the energy region of interest, topological reconstruction that allows
rejecting single-electron background events and a strong potential for ""in
situ"" tagging of the barium daughter ion. The experiment has been developing in
phases.
  The NEXT-White detector has recently finished operation at the LSC and
contained approximately an active Xe mass of 5 kg. Its purpose was to
demonstrate the excellent energy resolution, to validate the reconstruction
algorithms and the background model, and to make a measurement of the
two-neutrino double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe.
  The 100 kg NEXT-100 detector is under construction and is scheduled to be
installed and assembled by the first half of 2022. The predicted 90$\%$ CL
sensitivity to the neutrinoless double beta decay half-life will reach
$10^{26}$ years for an exposure of about 400 kg $\cdot$ year.
  A vigorous program towards the development of ton-scale detectors is also
under way, including extensive R$\&$D towards the realization of in-situ
Ba$^{2+}$ tagging as means to achieve virtually zero-background detection. A
first module with a mass of at least 500 kg may be operating as early as 2026

differential-algebraic equations (DAE). These states can represent local
perturbations of nodes in power systems with loads, which introduces
constraints into the system. These states must be valid initial conditions to
the DAE, meaning that they fulfill the algebraic equations. Additionally, these
states should represent perturbations of individual variables in the power
grid, such as a perturbation of the voltage at a load. These initial states
enable the calculation of probabilistic stability measures of power systems
with loads, which was not yet possible, but is important as these measures have
become a crucial tool in studying power systems. To verify that these
perturbations are network local, i.e. that the initial perturbation only
targets a single node in the power grid, a new measure, the spreadability,
related to the closeness centrality, is presented. The spreadability is
evaluated for an ensemble of typical power grids. The ensemble depicts a set of
future power grids where consumers, as well as producers, are connected to the
grid via inverters. For this power grid ensemble, we additionally calculate the
basin stability as well as the survivability, two probabilistic measures which
provide statements about asymptotic and transient stability. We also revisit
topological classes, that have been shown to predict the basin stability of
grids and explore if they still hold for grids with constraints and voltage
dynamics. We find that the degree of the nodes is a better predictor than the
topological classes for our ensemble. Finally, ambient forcing is applied to
calculate probabilistic stability measures of the IEEE 96 test case.

as emergent dipole sources, leading to qualitative changes in the mechanical

examine the effect of screening in classical glass formers. These are made of
point particles that interact via binary forces. Both inverse power law forces

planning unit is implemented with the proposed task types. The task planning
unit assigns tasks to each robot simultaneously through a single coalesced BT.
If any robot falls into a fault while performing its assigned task, another BT
embedded in the robot is executed; the robot enters the recovery mode in order
to overcome the fault. To perform this function, the action in the BT
corresponding to the task is defined as a variable, which is shared with the
DDS so that any action can be exchanged between the task planning unit and
robots. To show the feasibility of our framework in a real-world application,
three mobile robots were experimentally coordinated for them to travel
alternately to four goal positions by the proposed single task planning unit

CNAO Foundation, INFN and University of Torino have developed and commissioned
a Dose Delivery System (DDS) to monitor and guide ion beams accelerated by a
synchrotron and to distribute the dose with a 3D scanning technique. The target
volume, segmented in several layers orthogonally to the beam direction, is
irradiated by thousands of pencil beams which must be steered and held to the
prescribed positions until the prescribed number of particles has been
delivered. At CNAO, these operations are performed by the DDS. The main
components of this system are 2 independent beam monitoring detectors (BOX1 and
BOX2), interfaced with 2 control systems performing real-time control, and
connected to the scanning magnets and the beam chopper. As a reaction to any
potential hazard, a DDS interlock signal is sent to the Patient Interlock
System which immediately stops the irradiation. The tasks and operations
performed by the DDS are described following the data flow from the Treatment
Planning System through the end of the treatment delivery. The ability of the
DDS to guarantee a safe and accurate treatment was validated during the
commissioning phase by means of checks of the charge collection efficiency,
gain uniformity of the chambers and 2D dose distribution homogeneity and
stability. A high level of reliability and robustness has been proven by 3
years of system activity. The DDS described in this paper is one among the few
worldwide existing systems to operate ion beam for modulated scanning
radiotherapy. It has proven to guide and control the therapeutic pencil beams
with accuracy and stability showing dose deviations lower than the acceptance
threshold of 5% and 2.5% respectively during daily Quality Assurance

Bioinformatics (e.g. RNA assembly). However, because this problem and its
variants are NP-hard, practical multiassembly tools either use heuristics or
solve simpler, polynomial-time solvable versions of the problem, which may
yield solutions that are not mini-mal or do not perfectly decompose the flow.
Many RNA assemblers also use integer linear programming(ILP) formulations of
such practical variants, having the major limitation they need to encode all
the potentially exponentially many solution paths. Moreover, the only exact
solver for MFD does not scale to large instances and cannot be efficiently
generalized to practical MFD variants. In this work, we provide the first
practical ILP formulation for MFD (and thus the first fast and exact solver for
MFD), based on encoding all of the exponentially many solution paths using only
a quadratic number of variables. On both simulated and real flow graphs, our
approach solves any instance in under 13 seconds. We also show that our ILP

basic variant of the classical Young-Laplace-Dupr\'e (YLD) problem: The
capillary interaction between a liquid drop and a thin solid sheet of low
bending stiffness. Here, we consider a two-dimensional model where the sheet is
subjected to an external tensile load and the drop is characterized by a
well-defined Young's contact angle $\theta_Y$. Using a combination of
numerical, variational, and asymptotic techniques, we discuss wetting as a
function of the applied tension. We find that, for wettable surfaces with
$0<\theta_Y<\pi/2$, complete wetting is possible below a critical applied
tension thanks to the deformation of the sheet in contrast with rigid
substrates requiring $\theta_Y=0$. Conversely, for very large applied tensions,
the sheet becomes flat and the classical YLD situation of partial wetting is
recovered. At intermediate tensions, a vesicle forms in the sheet, which
encloses most of the fluid and we provide an accurate asymptotic description of
this wetting state in the limit of small bending stiffness. We show that
bending stiffness, however small, affects the entire shape of the vesicle. Rich
bifurcation diagrams involving partial wetting and ``vesicle'' solution are
found. For moderately small bending stiffnesses, partial wetting can coexist
both with the vesicle solution and complete wetting. Finally, we identify a
tension-dependent bendo-capillary length, $\lambda_\text{BC}$, and find that
the shape of the drop is determined by the ratio $A/\lambda_\text{BC}^2$, where
$A$ is the area of the drop.

tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a task-oriented semantic

to simultaneously minimize pixel-level and task-relevant semantic-level
distortion during communications under a certain rate, which formulates a new
rate-distortion optimization problem. To successfully measure the loss at the
semantic level, a new form of semantic distortion measured by the mutual
information between the semantic-reconstructed images and the task labels is
proposed. Then, we derive an analytical solution for the formulated problem,
where the self-consistent equations of the problem are obtained to determine
the optimal mapping of the source and the semantic-reconstructed images. To
implement TOSC-SR, we further obtain an extended form of rate-distortion form
based on the variational approximation of mutual information, which is
applicable to multiple AI tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed

between two networks based on the network structure and node attributes. Our
study is motivated by the fact that, since most of existing NA methods have
attempted to discover all node pairs at once, they do not harness information
enriched through interim discovery of node correspondences to more accurately
find the next correspondences during the node matching. To tackle this
challenge, we propose Grad-Align, a new NA method that gradually discovers node
pairs by making full use of node pairs exhibiting strong consistency, which are
easy to be discovered in the early stage of gradual matching. Specifically,
Grad-Align first generates node embeddings of the two networks based on graph
neural networks along with our layer-wise reconstruction loss, a loss built
upon capturing the first-order and higher-order neighborhood structures. Then,
nodes are gradually aligned by computing dual-perception similarity measures
including the multi-layer embedding similarity as well as the Tversky
similarity, an asymmetric set similarity using the Tversky index applicable to
networks with different scales. Additionally, we incorporate an edge
augmentation module into Grad-Align to reinforce the structural consistency.
Through comprehensive experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets, we
empirically demonstrate that Grad-Align consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art NA methods.

that when an optical system contains nanoscale polar elements these excitations
can acquire a longitudinal field component as a result of the material
dispersion of the lattice, leading to the formation of secondary quasiparticles
termed longitudinal-transverse polaritons. In this work we build on previous
macroscopic electromagnetic theories developing a full second-quantised theory
of longitudinal-transverse polaritons. Beginning from the Hamiltonian of the
light-matter system we treat distortion to the lattice introducing an elastic
free energy. We then diagonalise the Hamiltonian, demonstrating the equations

electromagnetism and quantise the nonlocal operators. Finally we demonstrate
how to reconstruct the electromagnetic fields in terms of the polariton states

demonstrate how nonlocality can narrow, enhance and spectrally tune near field

in reality, is of particular importance so that redundant information can be
identified and eliminated to provide an improved understanding of city
structure. To address this, we investigate in this work the relationship
between the spatial scale of the modelled network entities against the amount
of useful information contained within it. We employ an entropy measure from
complexity science and information theory to quantify the amount of information
residing in each presentation of the network subject to the spatial scale and
show that it peaks at some intermediate scale. The resulting network
presentation would allow us to have direct intuition over the hierarchical
structure of the urban organisation, which is otherwise not immediately
available from the traditional simple road network presentation. We demonstrate
our methodology on the Singapore road network and find the critical spatial
scale to be 85 m, at which the network obtained corresponds very well to the
planning boundaries used by the local urban planners, revealing the essential
urban connectivity structure of the city. Furthermore, the complexity measure
is also capable of informing the secondary transitions that correspond well to
higher-level hierarchical structures associated with larger-scale urban
planning boundaries in Singapore.

systems interacting with a time-varying field. They are ubiquitous in physics
with applications in different areas such as photonics, nano-electronics,

Rabi was intended for fermions in gyrating magnetic fields, Autler and Townes
realized that it could also be used to describe coherent light-matter
interaction within the rotating wave approximation\cite. Although intense
nanometer-wavelength light-sources have been available for more than a decade,
Rabi dynamics at such short wavelengths have not been observed directly. Here
we show that femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses from a seeded free-electron
laser can drive Rabi oscillations between the ground state and an excited state
in helium atoms. The measured photoemission signal revealed an Autler-Townes
doublet as well as an avoided crossing, phenomena that are both trademarks of
quantum optics. Using theoretical analyses that go beyond the strong-field

follows from a quantum interference effect between resonant and non-resonant
photoionization pathways. Given the recent availability of intense attosecond

to carry out ultrafast manipulation of coherent processes at short wavelengths

similar to spectral nudging but does not require any spectral decomposition for
scales separation. This is expected to be particularly relevant for ISM, which
involves various interactions between large-scale circulations and regional
physical processes. Along with a control simulation, several downscaling
simulations were conducted with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
model using CDA, spectral (retaining different wavenumbers) and grid nudging
for three ISM seasons: normal (2016), excess (2013), and drought (2009). The
simulations are nested within the NCEP Final Analysis and the model outputs are
evaluated against the observations. Compared to grid and spectral nudging, the
simulations using CDA produce enhanced ISM features over the Indian
subcontinent including the low-level jet, tropical easterly jet, easterly wind
shear, and rainfall distributions for all investigated ISM seasons. The major
ISM processes, in particular the monsoon inversion over the Arabian Sea,
tropospheric temperature gradients and moist static energy over central India,
and zonal wind shear over the monsoon region, are all better simulated with
CDA. Spectral nudging outputs are found to be sensitive to the choice of the
wavenumber, requiring careful tuning to provide robust simulations of the ISM

plant sciences with little justification. Here, five protocols are
distinguished which deal differently with systematic/random errors and vary
considerably in result veracity. Aim: to compare prevalence of protocols
(defined in text). Medical/plant science articles from 2017/2019 were surveyed:
713 random articles assessed for eligibility for counts: first (with p-values):
1) non-replicated; 2) global; 3) triple-result protocols; second: 4)
replication-error protocol; 5) meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria:
human/plant/fungal studies with categorical groups. Exclusion criteria: phased
clinical trials, pilot studies, cases, reviews, technology, rare subjects,
-omic studies. Abbreviated PICOS question: which protocol was evident for a
main result with categorically distinct group difference(s) ? Electronic
sources: Journal Citation Reports 2017/2019, Google. Triplication prevalence
differed dramatically between sciences (both years p<10-16; cluster-adjusted
chi-squared tests): From 320 studies (80/science/year): in 2017, 53 (66%, 95%
confidence interval (C.I.) 56%:77%) and in 2019, 48 (60%, C.I. 49%:71%) plant
studies had triple-result or triplicated global protocols, compared with, in
both years, 4 (5%, C.I. 0.19%:9.8%) medical studies. Plant sciences had a
higher prevalence of protocols more likely to counter generalised systematic
errors (the most likely cause of false positives) and random error than
non-replicated protocols, without suffering from serious flaws found with
random-Institutes protocols. It is suggested that a triple-result
(organised-reproduction) protocol, with Institute consortia, is likely to solve
most problems connected with the replicability crisis.

propose a general framework that shows how CLIP can be effectively applied to

objective of CLIP and thus can leverage the rich image and text semantics
entailed in CLIP. Then we automatically compose instance-specific prompts by
conditioning them on the categories and image contents of instances,
diversifying prompts and avoiding suboptimal problems. Evaluations on six
widely-used affective datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods to a large margin (i.e., up to 9.29% accuracy gain
on EmotionROI dataset) on IEC tasks, with only a few parameters trained. Our

Different from ""deep"" fully-connected neural networks embedded with physical

the physical field is generated by a deconvolution layer and a single

constructed using the pre-trained shallow convolution layer. An efficient
linear interpolation network calculates the loss function involving boundary

dressing bare cavities with helium vessels, the welded vessel prevents access

there is no straightforward way to tune dressed cavities other than cutting the

significantly impact cost and schedule. In this paper, we present a novel

theories - in phases where the beta function, $\beta(g)$, with $g=g(\mu)$ the
renormalized gauge coupling, admits an isolated zero, $g_*$, in the infrared
(IR) or ultraviolet (UV). We point out that the LET sets constraints on 3-point
correlators involving the insertion of $Tr\, F^2$, its anomalous dimension
$\gamma_{F^2}$, and the anomalous dimensions of multiplicatively renormalizable
operators at $g_*$. These constraints intertwine with the exact conformal
scaling for $g(\mu)\rightarrow g_*$ with $\mu\neq 0,+\infty$ fixed and the
IR/UV asymptotics - which may or may not coincide with the IR/UV limit of the
aforementioned conformal scaling - for $\Lambda_{\scriptscriptstyle{IR/UV}}$
fixed. In the conformal case we also discuss how the LET for bare correlators
is the rationale for the existence in massless QCD of the mysterious divergent
contact term in the OPE of $Tr\,F^2$ with itself discovered in perturbation
theory in arXiv:1209.1516, arXiv:1407.6921 and computed to all orders in
arXiv:1601.08094. Specifically, if $\gamma_{F^2}$ does not vanish, the
divergent contact term in the rhs of the LET for the 2-point correlator of
$Tr\,F^2$ has to match - and we verify by direct computation that it actually
does - the divergence in the lhs due to the nontrivial anomalous dimension of
$Tr\,F^2$. Hence, remarkably, the additive renormalization due to the divergent
contact term in the rhs is related by the LET to the multiplicative
renormalization in the lhs, in such a way that a suitably renormalized version
of the LET has no ambiguity for additive renormalization.

results show that discriminative ZSL suffers from corruptions and this trend is
further exacerbated by the severe class imbalance and model weakness inherent

adversarial examples, such as the pseudo-robustness effect present under

steadily gains relevance in clinical practice due to the increasing incidence

promising results in the field of medical image segmentation have been
successfully developed over the last years, almost all of them struggle with
the challenge of accurately segmenting hepatic lesions in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). This led to the idea of combining elements of convolutional and
transformer-based architectures to overcome the existing limitations. This work
presents a hybrid network called SWTR-Unet, consisting of a pretrained ResNet,
transformer blocks as well as a common Unet-style decoder path. This network
was primarily applied to single-modality non-contrast-enhanced liver MRI and
additionally to the publicly available computed tomography (CT) data of the
liver tumor segmentation (LiTS) challenge to verify the applicability on other
modalities. For a broader evaluation, multiple state-of-the-art networks were
implemented and applied, ensuring a direct comparability. Furthermore,
correlation analysis and an ablation study were carried out, to investigate
various influencing factors on the segmentation accuracy of the presented
method. With Dice scores of averaged 98+-2% for liver and 81+-28% lesion
segmentation on the MRI dataset and 97+-2% and 79+-25%, respectively on the CT

spanning up to several minutes. Accurately categorizing these activities
requires not only recognizing the individual steps that compose the task but
also capturing their temporal dependencies. This problem is dramatically
different from traditional action classification, where models are typically
optimized on videos that span only a few seconds and that are manually trimmed
to contain simple atomic actions. While step annotations could enable the
training of models to recognize the individual steps of procedural activities,
existing large-scale datasets in this area do not include such segment labels

instructional videos by leveraging the distant supervision of a textual

uses a language model to match noisy, automatically-transcribed speech from the
video to step descriptions in the knowledge base. We demonstrate that video
models trained to recognize these automatically-labeled steps (without manual

performance on four downstream tasks: recognition of procedural activities,
step classification, step forecasting and egocentric video classification.

continuum of agents behaves according to a version of Experience-Weighted
Attraction (EWA) algorithm. The dynamics is characterized by two parameters:
the (population) intensity of choice $a>0$ capturing the economic rationality
of the total population of agents and a discount factor $\sigma\in [0,1]$
capturing a type of memory loss where past outcomes matter exponentially less
than the recent ones. Finally, our system adds a third parameter $b \in (0,1)$,
which captures the asymmetry of the cost functions of the two resources. It is
the proportion of the agents using the first resource at Nash equilibrium, with
$b=1/2$ capturing a symmetric network.
  Within this simple framework, we show a plethora of bifurcation phenomena
where behavioral dynamics destabilize from global convergence to equilibrium,
to limit cycles or even (formally proven) chaos as a function of the parameters
$a$, $b$ and $\sigma$. Specifically, we show that for any discount factor
$\sigma$ the system will be destabilized for a sufficiently large intensity of

regime will give place to the attracting periodic orbit of period 2. Therefore,
memory loss can simplify game dynamics and make the system predictable. We
complement our theoretical analysis with simulations and several bifurcation

this work, we derive a new class of default priors that approximate reference
priors for the parameters of some Gaussian random fields. It is based on an
approximation to the integrated likelihood of the covariance parameters derived
from the spectral approximation of stationary random fields. This prior depends
on the structure of the mean function and the spectral density of the model
evaluated at a set of spectral points associated with an auxiliary regular
grid. In addition to preserving the desirable Bayesian and frequentist
properties, these approximate reference priors are more stable, and their
computations are much less onerous than those of exact reference priors. Unlike
exact reference priors, the marginal approximate reference prior of correlation
parameter is always proper, regardless of the mean function or the smoothness
of the correlation function. This property has important consequences for
covariance model selection. An illustration comparing default Bayesian analyses

  - Average-case complexity. We define a pseudo-random class of functions which

the extremum seeking control (ESC) jointly with learning algorithms is proposed
to seek a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) for a class of noncooperative
games with coupled equality constraint. The strategy of each agent is
restricted by both the coupled inter-agent constraint and local inequality
constraints. Thanks to the ESC, it is unnecessary to know the specific
expressions of agents' cost functions and local constraints and to know the
strategies of other agents for the implementation of the proposed GNE seeking
algorithm. To deal with the coupled constraints, only the Lagrange multiplier
is transmitted among agents with some prior information about the coupled
constraints. Moreover, a diminishing dither signal is designed in the seeking
algorithm to remove undesirable steady-state oscillations. The non-local
convergence of the designed seeking algorithm is analyzed via the singular
perturbation theory, averaging analysis and Lyapunov stability theory.
Numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

upper transition of the cascaded photons in a fiber-based quantum network.
Meanwhile, the infrared photon from the lower transition of this highly
directional and frequency-correlated biphoton can be created under the
four-wave mixing process and can be stored locally as a collective spin wave.
Here we theoretically investigate the frequency entanglement of this biphoton
and propose two approaches to remove their mutual correlations in frequency
spaces. The first approach applies an optical cavity which modulates the
biphoton spectrum into a more symmetric and narrow spectral function by
multiplexing multiple atomic ensembles with phase compensation. The purity of
single photon reaches up to $0.999$ and the entanglement entropy $S$ of the
biphoton reduces to $0.006$, which is $200$ times smaller than the one without
multiplexing. The other approach employs a symmetric pumping of the laser
fields in two atomic ensembles, which leads to a moderate reduction of $S\sim
0.3$ when non-discrimination detection devices are used for both photons. An
extremely low frequency entanglement implies an almost indistinguishable single
photon source, which offers a potential resource for photonic quantum
simulation and computation.

using a 3D Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Network trained on low-level

semantic categories and reflects that human language processing highly
interacts with visual processing. Similar to humans, recent artificial models
jointly trained on texts and images, e.g., OpenAI CLIP, show language-biased
image classification. Exploring whether the bias leads to interference similar
to those observed in humans can contribute to understanding how much the model
acquires hierarchical semantic representations from joint learning of language
and vision. The present study introduces methodological tools from the
cognitive science literature to assess the biases of artificial models.
Specifically, we introduce a benchmark task to test whether words superimposed
on images can distort the image classification across different category levels
and, if it can, whether the perturbation is due to the shared semantic
representation between language and vision. Our dataset is a set of
word-embedded images and consists of a mixture of natural image datasets and
hierarchical word labels with superordinate/basic category levels. Using this
benchmark test, we evaluate the CLIP model. We show that presenting words
distorts the image classification by the model across different category
levels, but the effect does not depend on the semantic relationship between
images and embedded words. This suggests that the semantic word representation
in the CLIP visual processing is not shared with the image representation,
although the word representation strongly dominates for word-embedded images.

those in close contact with patients (Heymann and Shindo, 2020; Klompas et al.,
2021). The demand for those products increases exponentially as the number of
infected grows, outpacing any growth that local production facilities can
achieve (Ranney et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020). Disruptions in the global
supply chain by closing factories or scaled-down transport routes can further
increase resource scarcity (McMahon et al., 2020). During the first phase of
the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a reflex of `our people first' in many
regions, countries, and continents (Baldwin and Evenett, 2020). In this paper,
however, we show that a cooperative sharing mechanism can substantially improve
the ability to face epidemics. We present a stylized model in which communities
share their resources such that each can receive resources whenever a local
epidemic flares up. This can potentially prevent local resource exhaustion and
reduce the total number of infected cases. We also show that the success of
sharing resources heavily depends on having a sufficiently long delay between
the onset of epidemics in different communities. This means that a global
sharing mechanism should be paired with measures to slow down the spread of
infections from one community to the other. Our work is a first step towards
designing a resilient global supply chain mechanism that can deal with future
pandemics by design, rather than being subjected to the coincidental and
unequal distribution of opportunities per community at present.

consumers by charging their electricity usage based on intraday time-slots. To
design the prices associated with the proposed scheme, we formulate a bilevel
optimization problem that aims to minimize the Peak-to-Average Ratio (PAR) and
simultaneously benefit the consumers and the utility company. The bilevel
problem is converted into a single-level Mathematical Program with Equilibrium
Constraints (MPEC). The resulting MPEC is non-convex and includes nonlinear
constraints. Hence, to obtain a solution, it is relaxed into a Mixed Integer
Linear Program by dealing with all nonlinearities. To evaluate the
conservativeness of the proposed approach, a lower bound to the cost of the
original bilevel problem is obtained. The applicability of the proposed scheme
is demonstrated with simulations on various case studies, which exhibit a
significant reduction in PAR and economic gains for the utility company and
consumers. Moreover, simulation results show that the solutions of the original

proposed solution approach. Further simulation results demonstrate significant
advantages in the performance of the IBP scheme when compared to existing

operations and potential hazards while operating near a comet nucleus. Starting
from simple calculations comparing the cometary coma environment to benign
conditions on Earth, we progress to sophisticated engineering models of
spacecraft behavior, and then confront these models with recent spacecraft
proximity operations experience. Finally, we make recommendations from lessons
learned for future spacecraft missions that enter into orbit around a comet for
long-term operations. All of these considerations indicate that, with a proper
spacecraft design and operations planning, the near-nucleus environment can be
a relatively safe region in which to operate, even for an active short period
comet near perihelion with gas production rates as high as 1e29 molecules/s.
With gas densities similar to those found in good laboratory vacuums, dust
densities similar to Class 100 cleanrooms, dust particle velocities of 10s of
m/s, and microgravity forces that permit slow and deliberate operations, the
conditions around a comet are generally more benign than a typical day on Mars.
Even in strong dust jets near the nucleus surface, dust densities tend to be
only a few grains/cm3, about the same as in a typical interior room on Earth.
Stochastic forces on a modern spacecraft with tens of square meters of
projected surface area can be accounted for using modern Attitude Control
Systems to within tens of meters navigation error; surface contamination issues
are only important for spacecraft spending months to years within a few
kilometers of the nucleus surface; and the issues the Rosetta spacecraft faced,
confusion of celestial star trackers by sunlit dust particles flying past the
spacecraft, will be addressed using the next generation of star trackers
implementing improved transient rejection algorithms.

Using these parameters the component masses can be predicted, which has

energy resources, e.g., photovoltaic arrays, fuel cells, and energy-storage
devices, interfaced to an AC distribution network and operated independently
from the bulk power system. Energy conversion is typically managed by power
electronics in voltage source inverters. Drawing from the control of
synchronous machines in bulk power systems, different control schemes have been
recently adopted in order to achieve a stable network operation. The vast
majority of academic and industrial efforts opt for these strategies during
real-time operation.
  Starting with a dynamical averaged DC/AC converter model, we review different
controllers by presenting their main scope analytically and through
simulations. Next, we explore a new alternative of controlling DC/AC converters
in bulk power systems by matching traditional synchronous machines with
emphasis on the role that DC-circuit can play in control architecture, usually
neglected in conventional strategies. Compared to standard emulation methods,
our controller relies solely on readily available DC-side measurements and
takes into account the natural DC and AC storage elements. As a result, our
controller is generally faster and less vulnerable to delays and measurement
inaccuracies. We additionally provide insightful interpretations of the
suggested control, various plug-and-play properties of the closed-loop, such as
steady-state power flow analysis, passivity with respect to the DC and AC
ports, stability proof as well as high-level control architectures contributing
to enhancing the controller performance and attaining further control goals,
which we illustrate in both analysis and simulation.

trained model is a good surrogate for the current labeled data, from which data
acquisition is requested based on uncertainty/diversity. Our contribution is
debunking this myth and proposing a new objective for distillation. First, we
found example forgetting, which indicates the loss of knowledge learned across

consistency improves both uncertainty/diversity of labeled data. Lastly,

cross-modal retrieval. The core of cross-modal retrieval is how to measure the
similarity between different types of data. Many approaches have been developed
to solve the problem. As one of the mainstream, approaches based on subspace
learning pay attention to learning a common subspace where the similarity among
multi-modal data can be measured directly. However, many of the existing
approaches only focus on learning a latent subspace. They ignore the full use
of discriminative information so that the semantically structural information
is not well preserved. Therefore satisfactory results can not be achieved as
expected. We in this paper propose a discriminative supervised subspace
learning for cross-modal retrieval(DS2L), to make full use of discriminative
information and better preserve the semantically structural information.
Specifically, we first construct a shared semantic graph to preserve the
semantic structure within each modality. Subsequently, the Hilbert-Schmidt
Independence Criterion(HSIC) is introduced to preserve the consistence between
feature-similarity and semantic-similarity of samples. Thirdly, we introduce a
similarity preservation term, thus our model can compensate for the
shortcomings of insufficient use of discriminative data and better preserve the
semantically structural information within each modality. The experimental
results obtained on three well-known benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method against the compared
classic subspace learning approaches.

insufficient digital secret key length or computing power. Hardware-based
optical cryptosystems can generate enormously longer secret keys and enable

exploited to generate physical secret keys of gigabit length and encrypt face

present a method to suppress the angular drift and pointing noise only with the
thermal management of the AOM crystal. We analyze the dependence of the angular
drift on the refractive index variation, and find that the angular drift is
very sensitivity to the temperature gradient which could induce the refractive
index gradient inside the AOM crystal. It reminds us such angular drift could
be significantly suppressed by carefully overlapping the zero temperature
gradient area with the position of the acousto-optic interaction zone. We
implement a water-cooling setup, and find that the angular drift of an AOM is
reduced over 100 times during the thermal transient, and the angular noise is
also suppressed to 1/3 of the non-cooled case. It should be emphasized that
this thermal control method is a general to suppress the beam drift in both the

affected by the vector potential in regions without any electric or magnetic
fields [1]. The Aharonov-Bohm effect was experimentally confirmed [2-3] and has
been found in many situations [4-6]. A common explanation is based on quantum
mechanics, which states that the wavefunctions associated with the charges will
accumulate a phase shift due to the vector potential. However, consensus about
its nature and interpretation has not been achieved [7-14]. We here propose a
simple but reasonable interpretation based on the theory for electromagnetic
radiation and couplings [15]. The energy associated with a pulse radiator is
divided into a Coulomb-velocity energy and a radiative energy, together with a
macroscopic Schott energy accounting for the energy exchange between them. All
these energies are expressed with terms including the potentials, so are the
mutual coupling energies. There exists a force acting on the moving charges
even though the fields completely vanish. This force makes the charges pass
through the magnetic solenoid in different velocity with different path length,
causing a phase shift the same as that obtained with quantum mechanics. The
theory is originally aimed for providing an interpretation for electromagnetic
radiation and mutual coupling. It is derived directly from the Maxwell theory
with no modification but only substitution and reorganization.

equation in a Hilbert space. This equation represents the abstract
generalization of the Ball integro-differential equation. The general nonlinear
case with respect to terms of the equation which include a square of a norm of
a gradient is considered. A three-layer semi-discrete scheme is proposed in
order to find an approximate solution. In this scheme, the approximation of
nonlinear terms that are dependent on the gradient is carried out by using an
integral mean. We show that the solution of the nonlinear discrete problem and
its corresponding difference analogue of a first-order derivative is uniformly
bounded. For the solution of the corresponding linear discrete problem, it is
obtained high-order a priori estimates by using two-variable Chebyshev
polynomials. Based on these estimates we prove the stability of the nonlinear
discrete problem. For smooth solutions, we provide error estimates for the
approximate solution. An iteration method is applied in order to find an
approximate solution for each temporal step. The convergence of the iteration
process is proved.

diversity, especially with respect to fostering the academic growth of
underserved students. While the research process itself is important, there is
not sufficient emphasis on the submission, presentation, and publication
process, which is a cause for concern given the meteoric rise of predatory
scientific conferences, which are based on profit only and have little to no
peer review. These conferences are a direct threat to integrity in science by
promoting work with little to no scientific merit. However, they also threaten
diversity in the AI community by marginalizing underrepresented groups away
from legitimate conferences due to convenience and targeting mechanisms like
e-mail invitations. Due to the importance of conference presentation in AI
research, this very specific problem must be addressed through direct
mentorship. In this work, we propose PreDefense, a mentorship program that
seeks to guide underrepresented students through the scientific conference and
workshop process, with an emphasis on choosing legitimate venues that align
with the specific work that the students are focused in and preparing students
of all backgrounds for future successful, integrous AI research careers.

and background of the producers and consumers of the posts play a crucial role
in determining if the content can be flagged as toxic. Adoption of automated
toxicity detection models in production can thus lead to a sidelining of the
various groups they aim to help in the first place. It has piqued researchers'
interest in examining unintended biases and their mitigation. Due to the
nascent and multi-faceted nature of the work, complete literature is chaotic in
its terminologies, techniques, and findings. In this paper, we put together a
systematic study of the limitations and challenges of existing methods for
mitigating bias in toxicity detection.
  We look closely at proposed methods for evaluating and mitigating bias in
toxic speech detection. To examine the limitations of existing methods, we also
conduct a case study to introduce the concept of bias shift due to
knowledge-based bias mitigation. The survey concludes with an overview of the
critical challenges, research gaps, and future directions. While reducing
toxicity on online platforms continues to be an active area of research, a
systematic study of various biases and their mitigation strategies will help
the research community produce robust and fair models.

  Extensible Policy Generalization",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, incorporating natural language instructions into reinforcement
learning (RL) to learn semantically meaningful representations and foster
generalization has caught many concerns. However, the semantical information in
language instructions is usually entangled with task-specific state
information, which hampers the learning of semantically invariant and reusable
representations. In this paper, we propose a method to learn such
representations called element randomization, which extracts task-relevant but
environment-agnostic semantics from instructions using a set of environments
with randomized elements, e.g., topological structures or textures, yet the
same language instruction. We theoretically prove the feasibility of learning
semantically invariant representations through randomization. In practice, we
accordingly develop a hierarchy of policies, where a high-level policy is
designed to modulate the behavior of a goal-conditioned low-level policy by
proposing subgoals as semantically invariant representations. Experiments on
challenging long-horizon tasks show that (1) our low-level policy reliably
generalizes to tasks against environment changes; (2) our hierarchical policy
exhibits extensible generalization in unseen new tasks that can be decomposed
into several solvable sub-tasks; and (3) by storing and replaying language
trajectories as succinct policy representations, the agent can complete tasks
in a one-shot fashion, i.e., once one successful trajectory has been attained.

  Regarded as a Random Variable and Bayes Optimal Processing",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study deals with two-dimensional (2D) signal processing using the
wavelet packet transform. When the basis is unknown the candidate of basis
increases in exponential order with respect to the signal size. Previous
studies do not consider the basis as a random vaiables. Therefore, the cost
function needs to be used to select a basis. However, this method is often a
heuristic and a greedy search because it is impossible to search all the
candidates for a huge number of bases. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate
the entire signal processing under a criterion and also it does not always
gurantee the optimality of the entire signal processing. In this study, we
propose a stochastic generative model in which the basis is regarded as a
random variable. This makes it possible to evaluate entire signal processing
under a unified criterion i.e. Bayes criterion. Moreover we can derive an
optimal signal processing scheme that achieves the theoretical limit. This
derived scheme shows that all the bases should be combined according to the
posterior in stead of selecting a single basis. Although exponential order
calculations is required for this scheme, we have derived a recursive algorithm
for this scheme, which successfully reduces the computational complexity from
the exponential order to the polynomial order.

spectroscopy corresponding to the CE at an interface, which might impact our
understanding of the interaction between solids, liquids, and gases. The
physics presented here could be expanded to Auger electron excitation, x-ray
emission, and electron emission in CE for general cases, which remain to be
explored. This could lead to a general field that may be termed as contact

contemporary scholars utilize the quaternions and octonions to research the
electromagnetic fields and gravitational fields and so forth. In the paper, the
octonions are capable of surveying the electromagnetic and gravitational fields
within material media, including the octonion field strength, field source,
angular momentum, torque, and force. Further, the octonion field strength and
angular momentum can be combined together to become the octonion composite
field strength, deducing the octonion composite torque and force and others.
When the octonion composite force is equal to zero under certain circumstances,
it is able to achieve eight equations independent of each other, including the
force equilibrium equation, fluid continuity equation, and current continuity
equation and so on. The above reveals that the material media and octonion

COVID-19. As the world strives to get an effective medication to control the
disease, appropriate intervention measures, for now, remains one of the
effective methods to reduce the spread of the disease. Optimal control
strategies have proven to be an effective method in curtailing the spread of
infectious diseases. In this paper, a model has been formulated to study
transmission dynamics of the disease. Basic properties of the model such as the
basic reproduction number, equilibrium points and stability of the equilibrium
points have been determined. Sensitivity analysis was carried on to determine
the impact of the model parameters on the basic reproduction number. We also
introduced a compartment for the deceased and examined the behaviour of
COVID-19 related deaths. The numerical simulation prediction is consistent with
real data from Ghana for the period March 2020 to March 2021. The simulation
revealed the disease had less impact on the population during the first seven
months of the outbreak. To help contain the spread of the disease, time
dependent optimal controls were incorporated into the model and Pontryagin
maximum principle was used to characterize vital conditions of the optimal
control model. Numerical simulations of the optimal control model showed that,
combination of optimal preventive strategies such as nose mask and vaccination
are effective to significantly decrease the number of COVID-19 cases in
different compartments of the model. Vaccination decreases the susceptibility
to the disease whereas mask usage preserved the susceptible population from
extinction.
