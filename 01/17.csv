disease that first appeared on January 13, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Some of the
symptoms of this disease are fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty
in breathing. In more serious cases, death may occur as a result of infection.
COVID19 emerged as a pandemic that affected the whole world in a little while.
The most important issue in the fight against the epidemic is the early
diagnosis and follow-up of COVID19 (+) patients. Therefore, in addition to the
RT-PCR test, medical imaging methods are also used when identifying COVID 19
(+) patients. In this study, an alternative approach was proposed using cough
data, one of the most prominent symptoms of COVID19 (+) patients. The
performances of z-normalization and min-max normalization methods were
investigated on these data. All features were obtained using discrete wavelet
transform method. Support vector machines (SVM) was used as classifier
algorithm. The highest performances of accuracy and F1-score were obtained as
100% and 100% using the min-max normalization, respectively. On the other hand,
the highest accuracy and highest F1-score performances were obtained as 99.2 %
and 99.0 % using the z-normalization, respectively. In light of the results, it
is clear that cough acoustic data will contribute significantly to controlling
COVID19 cases.

use her private observation to support the incentive compatibility of the
delegation via informational burning, a process we refer to as the
looking-forward persuasion. The delegation mechanism is formulated in which the
agents form belief hierarchies due to the persuasion and play a dynamic
Bayesian game. We propose a novel randomized mechanism, known as Bayesian
promised delegation (BPD), in which the periodic incentive compatibility is
guaranteed by persuasions and promises of future delegations. We show that the
BPD can achieve the same optimal social welfare as the original mechanism in

previous cellular technologies. This has raised expectations on the possibility
to support advanced V2X services using the cellular network via
Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) and V2N2V connections. Replacing direct V2V
connections by V2N/V2N2V communications to support critical V2X services
requires low V2N/V2N2V latencies. It is then necessary to quantify the latency
values that V2N and V2N2V connections can achieve over 5G end-to-end (E2E)
connections, but these depend on the particular 5G network deployments and
configurations and to date the number of related studies is limited. This paper
progresses the state-of-the-art by introducing a novel E2E latency model to
quantify the latency of 5G V2N/V2N2V communications. The model includes the
latency introduced at the radio, transport, core, Internet, peering points and
application server (AS) for single MNO and multi-MNO scenarios. This paper
estimates the E2E latency for a large variety of possible 5G network
deployments that are being discussed or envisioned to support V2X services.
This includes the possibility to deploy the V2X AS from the edge of the network
to the cloud. The model is utilized to analyze the impact of different 5G
network deployments and configurations on the E2E latency. The analysis helps
identify which 5G network deployments and configurations are more suitable to
meet V2X latency requirements. The conducted analysis highlights the challenge
for centralized network deployments that locate the V2X AS at the cloud to meet
the latency requirements of advanced V2X services. Locating the V2X AS closer
to the cell edge reduces the latency. However, it requires a higher number of
ASs and also a careful dimensioning of the network and its configuration to
ensure sufficient network and AS resources are dedicated to serve the V2X
traffic.

latency of 5G at the radio network level. The model accounts for the use of
different numerologies (SCS, slot durations and Cyclic Prefixes), modulation

reflect different importance of vertices within a hyperedge, thus leading to
better characterized cut properties. More precisely, we introduce a new class
of hyperedge splitting functions that we call EDVWs-based, where the penalty of
splitting a hyperedge depends only on the sum of EDVWs associated with the
vertices on each side of the split. Moreover, we provide a way to construct
submodular EDVWs-based splitting functions and prove that a hypergraph equipped
with such splitting functions can be reduced to a graph sharing the same cut
properties. In this case, the hypergraph minimum s-t cut problem can be solved
using well-developed solutions to the graph minimum s-t cut problem. In
addition, we show that an existing sparsification technique can be easily
extended to our case and makes the reduced graph smaller and sparser, thus
further accelerating the algorithms applied to the reduced graph. Numerical
experiments using real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
EDVWs-based splitting functions in comparison with the all-or-nothing splitting
function and cardinality-based splitting functions commonly adopted in existing

realistic models of measurements, in which branches are defined by decoherence
theory, fails this test. The new rule hinges on the use of decoherence theory
in defining branching structure, and specifically decoherent histories theory.
On this basis ratios of branch numbers are defined, free of any convention.
They agree with the Born rule, and deliver a notion of objective probability
similar to na\""ive frequentism, save that the frequencies of outcomes are not
confined to a single world at different times, but spread over worlds at a
single time. Nor is it ad hoc: it is recognizably akin to the combinatorial
approach to thermodynamic probability, as introduced by Boltzmann in 1879. It
is identical to the procedure followed by Planck, Bose, Einstein and Dirac in
defining the equilibrium distribution of the Bose-Einstein gas. It also
connects in a simple way with the decision-theory approach to quantum

shear and time-dependent rheology of an aging suspension can be exploited to
generate a wide variety of interfacial patterns during its displacement by a
Newtonian fluid. Using video imaging, we report a rich array of interfacial
pattern morphologies: dense viscous, dendritic, viscoelastic fracture,
flower-shaped, jagged and stable, during the miscible and immiscible
displacements of an aging colloidal clay suspension by Newtonian fluids
injected into a radial quasi-two-dimensional geometry at different flow rates.
We propose a new parameter, the areal ratio, which we define as the
fully-developed pattern area normalized by the area of the smallest circle
enclosing it. We show that the natural logarithms of the areal ratios uniquely
identify the distinct pattern morphologies, such that each pattern can be
segregated in a three-dimensional phase diagram spanned by the suspension aging

machine learning with computationally-efficient, low-fidelity (partial) physics
models, leading to improved generalizability, extrapolability, and robustness
to noise, compared to pure data-driven approximation models. Recently a new
PIML architecture was reported by the same authors, known as Opportunistic
Physics-mining Transfer Mapping Architecture or OPTMA, which transfers the
original inputs into latent features using a transfer neural network; the
partial physics model then uses the latent features to generate the final
output that is as close as possible to the high-fidelity output. While
gradient-free solvers and back-propagation with supervised learning was earlier
used to train OPTMA, that approach is computationally inefficient and
challenging to generalize across different problems or popular ML
implementations. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by infusing the
partial physics model inside the neural network, as described via tensors in
the popular ML framework, PyTorch. Such a description also naturally allows
auto-differentiation (AD) of the partial physics model, thereby enabling the
use of efficient back-propagation methods to train the transfer network. The
benefits of the upgraded OPTMA architecture with AD (OPTMA-Net) is demonstrated
by applying it to the problem of modeling the sound pressure field created by a
hovering unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Ground truth data for this problem was
obtained from an indoor UAV noise measurement setup. Here, the partial physics
model is based on the interference of acoustic pressure waves generated by an
arbitrary number of acoustic monopole sources. Case studies show that OPTMA-Net
provides generalization performance close to, and extrapolation performance
that is 4 times better than, those given by a pure data-driven model.

Magnetization Transfer (MT) contrast in the presence of transmit field

being purely longitudinal, with the applied $B_1^+$ field saturating but not
rotating its magnetization, thus standard pTx pulse design methods do not
apply. Theory and Methods: Pulse design for Saturation Homogeneity (PUSH)
optimizes pTx RF pulses by considering uniformity of root-mean squared $B_1^+$,
$B_1^{rms}$, which relates to the rate of semisolid saturation. Here we
considered designs consisting of a small number of spatially non-selective
sub-pulses optimized over either a single 2D plane or 3D. Simulations and in
vivo experiments on a 7T Terra system with an 8-TX Nova head coil in 5 subjects
were carried out to study the homogenization of $B_1^{rms}$ and of the MT
contrast by acquiring MT ratio maps. Results: Simulations and in vivo
experiments showed up to 6 and 2 times more uniform $B_1^{rms}$ compared to
circular polarized (CP) mode for 2D and 3D optimizations, respectively. This
translated into 4 and 1.25 times more uniform MT contrast, consistently for all
subjects, where 2 sub-pulses were enough for the implementation and coil used.
Conclusion: The proposed PUSH method obtains more uniform and higher MT
contrast than CP mode within the same SAR budget.

samples, (ii) non-destructively pull-testing the final truss, and (iii)
measuring the thermal conductivity of the carbon fiber tubes. We found that the
strut strength is limited by the mounting fasteners and the strut end caps, not
the epoxy adhesive or the carbon fiber tube. This result is consistent with our
numerical predictions. Our thermal measurements suggest that the conductive
heat load through the struts (from 4 K to 1 K) will be less than 1 mW. This
strut design may be a promising candidate for use in other cryogenic support
structures.

challenge for effective location recommender systems. In this paper, we present
Axolotl (Automated cross Location-network Transfer Learning), a novel method
aimed at transferring location preference models learned in a data-rich region
to significantly boost the quality of recommendations in a data-scarce region.
Axolotl predominantly deploys two channels for information transfer, (1) a
meta-learning based procedure learned using location recommendation as well as
social predictions, and (2) a lightweight unsupervised cluster-based transfer
across users and locations with similar preferences. Both of these work
together synergistically to achieve improved accuracy of recommendations in
data-scarce regions without any prerequisite of overlapping users and with
minimal fine-tuning. We build Axolotl on top of a twin graph-attention neural
network model used for capturing the user- and location-conditioned influences
in a user-mobility graph for each region. We conduct extensive experiments on
12 user mobility datasets across the U.S., Japan, and Germany, using 3 as
source regions and 9 of them (that have much sparsely recorded mobility data)
as target regions. Empirically, we show that Axolotl achieves up to 18% better
recommendation performance than the existing state-of-the-art methods across
all metrics.

identify the water line, second approach uses a split sliding window to compute
the sum of squared difference in pixel intensities to find the water surface.

efficient and based on a rigorous theory, suitable for applying to general

be dubbed as prebiotic. Organic molecules have been discovered not just in
interstellar clouds from the Solar neighbourhood, but also throughout the
Milky-Way, as well as in nearby galaxies, or some of the most distant quasars.
These discoveries were made possible by the completion of large sub-millimetre
and radio facilities. Equipped with new generation receivers, those instruments
have provided the orders of magnitude leap in sensitivity required to detect
the weak rotational lines that allowed the molecule identifications. Last two
years, 30 prebiotic molecules have been detected in TMC-1, a dust-enshrouded
gaseous cloud located at 400 light-years from the Sun in the Taurus
constellation. Ten new molecular species, have been identified in the arm of a
spiral galaxy 6 billion light-yr distant, and 12 molecular species observed in

approaches on spin density matrix elements and polarization parameters, but
also investigates the effects of leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order

Moreover, as a continuation of the work, the prospects for possible NP
scenarios through top-quark spin-spin correlation and polarization measurements
for Supersymmetry (R parity conserved and violated models) and Dark Matter (top
quarks associated mediator) models during upcoming LHC runs are briefly
outlined. We find that all SM MC predictions for the defined set of variables

$|\Delta\phi_{ll}|$) and the observables generated by parity (P) and

According to conventional quark model, both $D^+ D^{0\ast}$ and $(D^0
D^{+\ast})$ multiquark states are expected to have the same mass and flavor in
the exact $SU(3)$ symmetry. However, since the quark masses are different,
$SU(3) (SU(2))$ symmetry is violated, hence, the mass and flavor eigenstates do
not coincide. The mass eigenstates can be represented as a linear combination
of the flavor eigenstates, which is characterized by the mixing angle $\theta$.
In the present work, the possible mixing angles between the $T_{cc}$ states are
calculated. Moreover, the analysis are extended for all the possible
tetraquarks scenarios with two heavy and two light quarks within the molecular
picture although those states have not been observed yet. Our prediction on

model which, after accounting for pervasive co-movements of the variables by
{\it common} factors, models the remaining {\it idiosyncratic} dynamic
dependence between the variables as a sparse VAR process. Network estimation of
FNETS consists of three steps: (i) factor-adjustment via dynamic principal
component analysis, (ii) estimation of the latent VAR process via
$\ell_1$-regularised Yule-Walker estimator, and (iii) estimation of partial
correlation and long-run partial correlation matrices. In doing so, we learn
three networks underpinning the VAR process, namely a directed network
representing the Granger causal linkages between the variables, an undirected
one embedding their contemporaneous relationships and finally, an undirected
network that summarises both lead-lag and contemporaneous linkages. In
addition, FNETS provides a suite of methods for forecasting the factor-driven
and the idiosyncratic VAR processes. Under general conditions permitting tails
heavier than the Gaussian one, we derive uniform consistency rates for the
estimators in both network estimation and forecasting, which hold as the
dimension of the panel and the sample size diverge. Simulation studies and real

black holes with large mass ratios. Similar to the previously-studied
equal-mass case, our numerical evolutions of the merger produce either a
nonspinning boson star or a spinning black hole, depending on the initial
masses and on the binary angular momentum. We do not find any evidence of
synchronized scalar clouds forming around either the remnant spinning black
hole or around the remnant boson stars. Interestingly, in contrast to the
equal-mass case, one of the mechanisms to dissipate angular momentum is now
asymmetric, and leads to large kick velocities (up to a few $10^4\,{\rm km/s}$)
which could produce wandering remnant boson stars. We also compare the
gravitational wave signals predicted from boson star binaries with those from
black hole binaries, and comment on the detectability of the differences with
ground interferometers.

different amount of Mn by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique and
temperature dependent photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopic study has helped us
in understanding how such deposition affects the dynamics of excitonic
recombination in this system. The study further reveals two distinctly
different Mn-incorporation regimes. Below a certain critical deposition amount
of Mn, thin Mn-coating with large area coverage is found on MoS$_2$ layers and
in this regime, substitution of Mo ions by Mn is detected through XPS.
Dewetting takes place when Mn-deposition crosses the critical mark, which
results in the formation of Mn-droplets on MoS$_2$ layers. In this regime,
substitutional incorporation of Mn is suppressed, while the Raman study
suggests an enhancement of disorder in the lattice with the Mn-deposition time.
From PL investigation, it has been found that the increase of the amount of
Mn-deposition not only enhances the density of non-radiative recombination
channels for the excitons but also raises the barrier height for such
recombination to take place. The study attributes these non-radiative
transitions to certain Mo related defects (either Mo-vacancies or distorted
Mo-S bonds), which are believed to be generated in large numbers during
Mn-droplet formation stage as a result of the withdrawal of Mn ions from the
Mo-substitutional sites.

as an important characteristic of a society can be introduced in a mathematical
language in terms of a country gross productivity factor, safety and social
factors, environmental and economic factors, political and healthy factors,
educational and cultural factors and so on using some weights, where these
weights can be determined using regression or machine learning techniques. By
inspiring from the natural phenomena such as heat conduction models; heat
conduction and heat convection models, a constitutive model for migration flow
rate in terms of the equivalent weighted wealth gradient descent has been given
where accompanying with other balance laws it can make possible to determine
wealth distribution and migration flow rate across the world. Some critical
conditions such as earthquakes, war, famine, insecurity, and more prevent the
natural transmission of wealth and lead to the intensification of
non-uniformity in wealth distribution. The increase in the equivalent weighted
wealth difference between countries leads to an enhanced legal migration rate
as well as a boosted illegal migration flow rate where it exceeds a threshold

can identify sound sources as repeating patterns embedded in the acoustic
input. Source repetition produces temporal regularities that can be detected
and used for segregation. Specifically, listeners can identify sounds occurring
more than once across different mixtures, but not sounds heard only in a single
mixture. However, whether such a behaviour can be computationally modelled has
not yet been explored. Here, we propose a biologically inspired computational
model to perform blind source separation on sequences of mixtures of acoustic

Hebbian-like learning rule which can detect spatio-temporal patterns recurring

reminiscent of the features of human performance in a variety of experimental
settings involving synthesized sounds with naturalistic properties.
Furthermore, we extend the study to investigate the properties of segregation
on task settings not yet explored with human subjects, namely natural sounds
and images. Overall, our work suggests that somatodendritic neuron models offer
a promising neuro-inspired learning strategy to account for the characteristics

optimally replenish inventory from multiple suppliers. To solve such
optimization problems, inventory managers need to decide what quantities to
order from each supplier, given the net inventory and outstanding orders, so
that the expected backlogging, holding, and sourcing costs are jointly
minimized. Inventory management problems have been studied extensively for over
60 years, and yet even basic dual-sourcing problems, in which orders from an
expensive supplier arrive faster than orders from a regular supplier, remain
intractable in their general form. In addition, there is an emerging need to
develop proactive, scalable optimization algorithms that can adjust their
recommendations to dynamic demand shifts in a timely fashion. In this work, we
approach dual sourcing from a neural network--based optimization lens and
incorporate information on inventory dynamics and its replenishment (i.e.,
control) policies into the design of recurrent neural networks. We show that
the proposed neural network controllers (NNCs) are able to learn near-optimal
policies of commonly used instances within a few minutes of CPU time on a

that they can control inventory dynamics with empirical, non-stationary demand

complex inventory management problems with non-stationary demand can be
obtained with deep neural-network optimization approaches that directly account

characterized by the abrupt change of a physical observable in response to the

restricted to equilibrium situations but can also be found in nonequilibrium
settings, both for classical and quantum mechanical systems. Here, we
investigate a nonequilibrium phase transition in a single-electron micromaser
consisting of a microwave cavity that is driven by the electron transport in a
double quantum dot. For weak electron-photon couplings, only a tiny fraction of
the transferred electrons lead to the emission of photons into the cavity,
which essentially remains empty. However, as the coupling is increased, many
photons are suddenly emitted into the cavity. Employing ideas and concepts from
full counting statistics and Lee-Yang theory, we analyze this nonequilibrium
phase transition based on the dynamical zeros of the factorial moment
generating function of the electronic charge transport, and we find that the

analysis of PnP Bayesian models and algorithms is difficult and works on the
topic often rely on unrealistic assumptions on the properties of the image
denoiser. This papers studies maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation for
Bayesian models with PnP priors. We first consider questions related to
existence, stability and well-posedness, and then present a convergence proof
for MAP computation by PnP stochastic gradient descent (PnP-SGD) under
realistic assumptions on the denoiser used. We report a range of imaging
experiments demonstrating PnP-SGD as well as comparisons with other PnP

with few samples. To this end, overparameterization has been the subject of
immense interest to explain the generalization ability of deep nets even when
the size of the dataset is smaller than that of the model. While the prior
literature focuses on the classical supervised setting, this paper aims to
demystify overparameterization for meta-learning. Here we have a sequence of
linear-regression tasks and we ask: (1) Given earlier tasks, what is the
optimal linear representation of features for a new downstream task? and (2)
How many samples do we need to build this representation? This work shows that
surprisingly, overparameterization arises as a natural answer to these
fundamental meta-learning questions. Specifically, for (1), we first show that
learning the optimal representation coincides with the problem of designing a
task-aware regularization to promote inductive bias. We leverage this inductive
bias to explain how the downstream task actually benefits from
overparameterization, in contrast to prior works on few-shot learning. For (2),
we develop a theory to explain how feature covariance can implicitly help
reduce the sample complexity well below the degrees of freedom and lead to
small estimation error. We then integrate these findings to obtain an overall
performance guarantee for our meta-learning algorithm. Numerical experiments on

microstructure using backscattered echo signals from clinical scanners. Among
different QUS parameters, scatterer number density is an important property
that can affect estimation of other QUS parameters. Scatterer number density
can be classified into high or low scatterer densities. If there are more than
10 scatterers inside the resolution cell, the envelope data is considered as
Fully Developed Speckle (FDS) and otherwise, as Under Developed Speckle (UDS).
In conventional methods, the envelope data is divided into small overlapping
windows (a strategy here we refer to as patching), and statistical parameters
such as SNR and skewness are employed to classify each patch of envelope data.
However, these parameters are system dependent meaning that their distribution
can change by the imaging settings and patch size. Therefore, reference
phantoms which have known scatterer number density are imaged with the same
imaging settings to mitigate system dependency. In this paper, we aim to
segment regions of ultrasound data without any patching. A large dataset is
generated which has different shapes of scatterer number density and mean
scatterer amplitude using a fast simulation method. We employ a convolutional
neural network (CNN) for the segmentation task and investigate the effect of
domain shift when the network is tested on different datasets with different
imaging settings. Nakagami parametric image is employed for the multi-task
learning to improve the performance. Furthermore, inspired by the reference
phantom methods in QUS, A domain adaptation stage is proposed which requires
only two frames of data from FDS and UDS classes. We evaluate our method for
different experimental phantoms and in vivo data.

CMOS compatible reconstruction-based on-chip spectrometer pixels capable of
spectrally resolving the visible spectrum with 1 nm spectral resolution
maintaining high accuracy (>95 %) and low footprint (8 um x 8 um), all without
the use of any additional filters. A single spectrometer pixel is formed by an

their integrated nanostructures, this allows us to computationally reconstruct
the hyperspectral image. To achieve distinct responsivity, we utilize random
photon-trapping nanostructures per photodiode with different dimensions and
shapes that modify the coupling of light at different wavelengths. This also
reduces the spectrometer pixel footprint (comparable to conventional camera
pixels), thus improving spatial resolution. Moreover, deep trench isolation
(DTI) reduces the crosstalk between adjacent photodiodes. This miniaturized

constructing multi-agent potential games in autonomous driving. Moreover, two
solution algorithms, including self-play dynamics (e.g., best response
dynamics) and potential function optimization, are developed for each game. The
developed frameworks are then applied to two different traffic scenarios,
including intersection-crossing and lane-changing in highways. Statistical
comparative studies, including 1) finite potential game vs. continuous
potential game, and 2) best response dynamics vs. potential function
optimization, are conducted to compare the performances of different solution
algorithms. It is shown that both developed frameworks are practical (i.e.,
computationally efficient), reliable (i.e., resulting in satisfying driving
performances in diverse scenarios and situations), and robust (i.e., resulting
in satisfying driving performances against uncertain behaviors of the
surrounding vehicles) for real-time decision-making in autonomous driving.

dynamics of two coupled metronomes on a moving platform. Our experiments show
that the platform's motion is damped by a dry friction force of Coulomb type,
not the viscous linear friction force that has often been assumed in the past.
Prompted by this result, we develop a new mathematical model that builds on
previously introduced models, but departs from them in its treatment of the
friction on the platform. We analyze the model by a two-timescale analysis and
derive the slow-flow equations that determine its long-term dynamics. The
derivation of the slow flow is challenging, due to the stick-slip motion of the
platform in some parameter regimes. Simulations of the slow flow reveal various
kinds of long-term behavior including in-phase and antiphase synchronization of
identical metronomes, phase locking and phase drift of non-identical
metronomes, and metronome suppression and death. In these latter two states,
one or both of the metronomes come to swing at such low amplitude that they no
longer engage their escapement mechanisms. We find good agreement between our
theory, simulations, and experiments, but stress that our exploration is far
from exhaustive. Indeed, much still remains to be learned about the dynamics of
coupled metronomes, despite their simplicity and familiarity.

perception and human visual system modeling. Specifically, a saliency detection
algorithm based on a novel attention model is proposed for identifying
subsurface structures within seismic data volumes. The algorithm employs 3D-FFT
and a multi-dimensional spectral projection, which decomposes local spectra
into three distinct components, each depicting variations along different
dimensions of the data. Subsequently, a novel directional center-surround
attention model is proposed to incorporate directional comparisons around each
voxel for saliency detection within each projected dimension. Next, the
resulting saliency maps along each dimension are combined adaptively to yield a
consolidated saliency map, which highlights various structures characterized by
subtle variations and relative motion with respect to their neighboring
sections. A priori information about the seismic data can be either embedded
into the proposed attention model in the directional comparisons, or
incorporated into the algorithm by specifying a template when combining
saliency maps adaptively. Experimental results on two real seismic datasets
from the North Sea, Netherlands and Great South Basin, New Zealand demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for detecting salient seismic
structures of different natures and appearances in one shot, which differs
significantly from traditional seismic interpretation algorithms. The results
further demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms comparable
state-of-the-art saliency detection algorithms for natural images and videos,
which are inadequate for seismic imaging data.

properties of a thin anisotropic and dissipative inhomogeneity in ${\mathbb
R}^m$, $m=2,3$ from scattering data. In the asymptotic limit as the thickness
goes to zero, the thin inhomogeneity is modeled by an open $m-1$ dimensional
manifold (here referred to as screen), and the field inside is replaced by jump
conditions on the total field involving a second order surface differential
operator. We show that all the surface coefficients (possibly matrix valued and
complex) are uniquely determined from far field patterns of the scattered
fields due to infinitely many incident plane waves at a fixed frequency. Then
we introduce a target signature characterized by a novel eigenvalue problem
such that the eigenvalues can be determined from measured scattering data,
adapting the approach in \cite{Screens}. Changes in the measured eigenvalues
are used to identified changes in the coefficients without making use of the
governing equations that model the healthy screen. In our investigation the
shape of the screen is known, since it represents the object being evaluated.
We present some preliminary numerical results indicating the validity of our
inversion approach.

another known as the `linear' process. We prove the banker process
disadvantages the nominated banker portfolio in volatile markets, while the
linear process may advantage or disadvantage portfolios.
  We describe an alternative process that uses the concept of

general show that the $n$-portfolio solution and its corresponding
`market-invariant' algorithm solve a system of nonlinear polynomial equations.
It turns out this algorithm is a rediscovery of the RAS algorithm (also called

using various statistical correlators for two-qudit mixed states. The salient
results obtained are as follows: (a) A scheme for determining the entanglement
measure given by Negativity is explored by analytically relating it to the
widely used statistical correlators viz. mutual predictability, mutual
information and Pearson Correlation coefficient for different types of
bipartite arbitrary dimensional mixed states. Importantly, this is demonstrated
using only a pair of complementary observables pertaining to the mutually
unbiased bases. (b) The relations thus derived provide the separability bounds
for detecting entanglement obtained for a fixed choice of the complementary
observables, while the bounds per se are state-dependent. Such bounds are
compared with the earlier suggested separability bounds. (c) We also show how
these statistical correlators can enable distinguishing between the separable,
distillable and bound entanglement domains of the one-parameter Horodecki
two-qutrit states. Further, the relations linking Negativity with the
statistical correlators have been derived for such Horodecki states in the
domain of distillable entanglement. Thus, this entanglement characterisation
scheme based on statistical correlators and harnessing complementarity of the
obsevables opens up a potentially rich direction of study which is applicable
for both distillable and bound entangled states.

resolved kinematics of molecular CO(1-0) emission reveals that there is a
blueshifted (redshifted) velocity component on the receding (approaching) side
of the galaxy along the stellar bar. This might provide a plausible evidence of
non-circular motion, such as the bar-induced molecular gas inflow. The velocity
of molecular gas inflow decreases with approaching towards the peak of the
off-center star formation in the north, which might be associated with the
inner Lindblad resonance (ILR). In addition to CO(1-0), we also detect the

different from many real-world DNN applications such as Traffic Sign

detectors use DNNs to process streaming video in real time. From the view of
object detectors, the traffic sign`s position and quality of the video are
continuously changing, rendering the digital AEs ineffective in the physical
world.
  In this paper, we propose a systematic pipeline to generate robust physical
AEs against real-world object detectors. Robustness is achieved in three ways.
First, we simulate the in-vehicle cameras by extending the distribution of
image transformations with the blur transformation and the resolution
transformation. Second, we design the single and multiple bounding boxes
filters to improve the efficiency of the perturbation training. Third, we
consider four representative attack vectors, namely Hiding Attack, Appearance

  We perform a comprehensive set of experiments under a variety of
environmental conditions, and considering illuminations in sunny and cloudy
weather as well as at night. The experimental results show that the physical
AEs generated from our pipeline are effective and robust when attacking the
YOLO v5 based TSR system. The attacks have good transferability and can deceive
other state-of-the-art object detectors. We launched HA and NTA on a brand-new

of BBHs can be used to constrain the merger rate as function of redshift and

methods are used to obtain the constraints on the source population properties
from the catalogues: 1. parametric differential merger rate model and applies a
Bayesian inference on the parameters; and 2. non-parametric and uses weighted
Kernel density estimators. The results show the overwhelming advantages of the

properties, especially at a redshifts higher than ~2, where the merger rate is
believed to peak. With the simulated aLIGO catalogue, the parametric Bayesian
method can still give some constraints on the merger rate density and mass
function beyond its detecting horizon, while the non-parametric method lose the
constraining ability completely there. We also find that, despite the numbers
of detection of the half-ET can be easily compatible with full ET after a
longer observation duration, the catalogue from the full ET can still give much
better constraints on the population properties, due to its smaller
uncertainties on the physical parameters of the GW events.

local intermediate inputs, most multinationals may leave the host country.
However, they are likely to stay if they are tightly linked with local
suppliers and face low trade costs of importing foreign intermediates. We
further provide a number of extensions of the basic model to incorporate, for
example, multinationals with heterogeneous productivity and disaster
reconstruction.

in the normal models, which are only activated when the model is aware of the
specific inputs (i.e., the trigger). However, despite their success in the
conventional Euclidean space, there are few studies of backdoor attacks on
graph structured data. In this paper, we propose a new type of backdoor which
is specific to graph data, called neighboring backdoor. Considering the
discreteness of graph data, how to effectively design the triggers while
retaining the model accuracy on the original task is the major challenge. To
address such a challenge, we set the trigger as a single node, and the backdoor
is activated when the trigger node is connected to the target node. To preserve
the model accuracy, the model parameters are not allowed to be modified. Thus,
when the trigger node is not connected, the model performs normally. Under
these settings, in this work, we focus on generating the features of the
trigger node. Two types of backdoors are proposed: (1) Linear Graph Convolution
Backdoor which finds an approximation solution for the feature generation (can
be viewed as an integer programming problem) by looking at the linear part of
GCNs. (2) Variants of existing graph attacks. We extend current gradient-based
attack methods to our backdoor attack scenario. Extensive experiments on two
social networks and two citation networks datasets demonstrate that all
proposed backdoors can achieve an almost 100\% attack success rate while having

energy or computing resources (e.g., in friendly jamming and cryptography-based
solutions), this work proposes a novel anti-eavesdropping solution that comes
with mostly no extra power nor computing resource requirement. This is achieved
by leveraging the ambient backscatter communications in which secret
information can be transmitted by backscattering it over ambient radio signals.
Specifically, the original message at the transmitter is first encoded into two
parts: (i) active transmit message and (ii) backscatter message. The active
transmit message is then transmitted by using the conventional wireless
transmission method while the backscatter message is transmitted by
backscattering it on the active transmit signals via an ambient backscatter
tag. As the backscatter tag does not generate any active RF signals, it is
intractable for the eavesdropper to detect the backscatter message. Therefore,
secret information, e.g., secret key for decryption, can be carried by the
backscattered message, making the adversary unable to decode the original
message. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed solution can
significantly enhance security protection for communication systems.

supporting low latency, mobility, and location awareness to delay-sensitive

vast amounts of data that come as data streams while balancing energy
consumption, latency, and the predictive performance of the algorithms.
Ensemble methods achieve remarkable predictive performance when applied to
evolving data streams due to the combination of several models and the
possibility of selective resets. This work investigates strategies for
optimizing the performance (i.e., delay, throughput) and energy consumption of
bagging ensembles to classify data streams. The experimental evaluation

photon detectors was sufficiently high relative to the time width of the
quantum state, so that the conventional theory of non-Gaussian state
preparation treated the detector's temporal resolution as negligible. However,
when using various photon detectors including photon-number-resolving
detectors, the temporal resolution is non-negligible. In this paper, we extend
the conventional theory of quantum state preparation using photon detectors to
the finite temporal resolution regime, analyze the cases of single-photon and
two-photon preparation as examples, and find that the generated states are
characterized by the dimensionless parameter $B$, defined as the product of the
temporal resolution of the detectors $\Delta t$ and the bandwidth of the light

In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based B\&B algorithm.
Similar to offline reinforcement learning, we initially train on the

stable perturbations are not the axisymmetric Taylor vortices but rather a
fully three-dimensional flow. The main result of the paper is an analytical
expression of the optimal bound as a function of the radius ratio. To obtain
this bound, we begin by deriving a suboptimal analytical bound using analysis
techniques. We use a definition of the background flow with two boundary
layers, whose relative thicknesses are optimized to obtain the bound. In the
limit of high Reynolds number, the dependence of this suboptimal bound on the
radius ratio (the geometrical scaling) turns out to be the same as that of
numerically computed optimal bounds in three different cases: (1) where the
perturbed flow only satisfies the homogeneous boundary conditions but need not
be incompressible, (2) the perturbed flow is three dimensional and
incompressible, (3) the perturbed flow is two dimensional and incompressible.
We compare the geometrical scaling with the observations from the turbulent
Taylor--Couette flow, and find that the analytical result indeed agrees well
with the available DNS data. In this paper, we also dismiss the applicability
of the background method to certain flow problems and therefore establish the
limitation of this method.

control system. We show that, under certain conditions, the set of random
occupational measures generated by the state-control trajectories of the system
as well as the set of their mathematical expectations converge (as the time
horizon tends to infinity) to a convex and compact (non-random) set, which is
shown to coincide with the set of stationary probabilities of the system. In
the second part, we apply the results obtained in the first part to deal with a
hybrid system that evolves in continuous time and is subjected to abrupt
changes of certain parameters. We show that the solutions of such a hybrid

Miura-ori-variant (SMOV) structure that has exceptional multistability and

transition sequences, including reversible and irreversible ones, are
uncovered, where they constitute a transition map that is editable upon
adjusting the design parameters. Via applying dynamic excitations and tailoring
the excitation conditions, reversible transitions between all stable

Benefiting from the nonlinearity of the quasi-static and dynamic transitions,
basic and compound mechanical logic gates are achieved. The versatility of the

different complex logic operations without increasing structural complexity,

However, pretrained LMs are well-known to be prone to intrinsic biases in their

language data(e.g., user reviews) used to fine-tune LMs for CRSs. We study a
recently introduced LM-driven recommendation backbone (termed LMRec) of a CRS
to investigate how unintended bias i.e., language variations such as name
references or indirect indicators of sexual orientation or location that should
not affect recommendations manifests in significantly shifted price and
category distributions of restaurant recommendations. The alarming results we
observe strongly indicate that LMRec has learned to reinforce harmful
stereotypes through its recommendations. For example, offhand mention of names
associated with the black community significantly lowers the price distribution
of recommended restaurants, while offhand mentions of common male-associated
names lead to an increase in recommended alcohol-serving establishments. These
and many related results presented in this work raise a red flag that advances
in the language handling capability of LM-drivenCRSs do not come without
significant challenges related to mitigating unintended bias in future deployed

contrastive learning by building pseudo-aligned entity pairs. Experimental

While most existing
solutions try to overlap/schedule computation and communication for efficient
training, this paper goes one step further by skipping computing and
communication through DNN layer freezing. Our key insight is that the training
progress of internal DNN layers differs significantly, and front layers often
become well-trained much earlier than deep layers. To explore this, we first
introduce the notion of training plasticity to quantify the training progress
of internal DNN layers. Then we design Egeria, a knowledge-guided DNN training
system that employs semantic knowledge from a reference model to accurately
evaluate individual layers' training plasticity and safely freeze the converged
ones, saving their corresponding backward computation and communication. Our
reference model is generated on the fly using quantization techniques and runs
forward operations asynchronously on available CPUs to minimize the overhead.
In addition, Egeria caches the intermediate outputs of the frozen layers with
prefetching to further skip the forward computation. Our implementation and
testbed experiments with popular vision and language models show that Egeria
achieves 19%-43% training speedup w.r.t. the state-of-the-art without
sacrificing accuracy.

based on individual characteristics, has recently attracted increasing
attention in many fields, such as medicine, social services, and economics.
Current literature mainly focuses on estimating treatment regimes from a single
source population. In real-world applications, the distribution of a target
population can be different from that of the source population. Therefore,
treatment regimes learned by existing methods may not generalize well to the
target population. Due to privacy concerns and other practical issues,
individual-level data from the target population is often not available, which
makes treatment regime learning more challenging. We consider the problem of
treatment regime estimation when the source and target populations may be
heterogeneous, individual-level data is available from the source population,
and only the summary information of covariates, such as moments, is accessible
from the target population. We develop a weighting framework that tailors a
treatment regime for a given target population by leveraging the available
summary statistics. Specifically, we propose a calibrated augmented inverse
probability weighted estimator of the value function for the target population
and estimate an optimal treatment regime by maximizing this estimator within a
class of pre-specified regimes. We show that the proposed calibrated estimator
is consistent and asymptotically normal even with flexible semi/nonparametric
models for nuisance function approximation, and the variance of the value
estimator can be consistently estimated. We demonstrate the empirical
performance of the proposed method using simulation studies and a real
application to an eICU dataset as the source sample and a MIMIC-III dataset as
the target sample.

interesting phenomenon is that there is a reversal of the phase of the dipole
anisotropies, which challenges a theoretical modeling. In this work, for the
first time, we identify that there might be an additional phase reversal at
$\sim 100$ GeV energies of the dipole anisotropies as indicated by a few
underground muon detectors and the first direct measurement by the Fermi
satellite, coincident with the hundreds of GV hardenings of the spectra. We
propose that these two phase reversals, together with the energy-evolution of
the amplitudes and spectra, can be naturally explained with a nearby source
overlapping onto the diffuse background. As a consequence, the spectra and
anisotropies can be understood as the scalar and vector components of this
model, and the two reversals of the phases characterize just the competition of
the cosmic ray streamings between the nearby source and the background. The
alignment of the cosmic ray streamings along the local large-scale magnetic
field may play an important but sub-dominant role in regulating the cosmic ray
propagation. More precise measurements of the anisotropy evolution at both low

setting, location, activity, and heart rate. Due to low recognition accuracy,
sometimes users cannot accurately infer others' status through activity
awareness. Recently, activity recognition technology has advanced. However, the
user behaviors of activity awareness with improved technology have not been
studied. In this study, we design ActAware, a mobile instant messaging
application that integrates activity awareness based on improved activity
recognition technology, i.e., improved recognition accuracy and the addition of
activity transition notification. We conduct a field study to explore user
behaviors and found that activity awareness allows users to speculate on the
reasons for chat interruption, plan communication, speculate on whether the
chat partner is departing/arriving, and deepen the understanding of living
patterns. Compared with disclosing other types of context information, users
have fewer privacy concerns about disclosing activity information in ActAware.
Based on these findings, we provide design recommendations for mobile messaging
to better support activity awareness.

  Trees",,,,"14","cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite the success of deep learning in computer vision and natural language
processing, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) is yet one of the most
powerful tools for applications with tabular data such as e-commerce and
FinTech. However, applying GBDT to multi-task learning is still a challenge.
Unlike deep models that can jointly learn a shared latent representation across
multiple tasks, GBDT can hardly learn a shared tree structure. In this paper,
we propose Multi-task Gradient Boosting Machine (MT-GBM), a GBDT-based method
for multi-task learning. The MT-GBM can find the shared tree structures and
split branches according to multi-task losses. First, it assigns multiple
outputs to each leaf node. Next, it computes the gradient corresponding to each
output (task). Then, we also propose an algorithm to combine the gradients of
all tasks and update the tree. Finally, we apply MT-GBM to LightGBM.
Experiments show that our MT-GBM improves the performance of the main task
significantly, which means the proposed MT-GBM is efficient and effective.

without disclosing their local data. Vertical federated learning (VFL) handles
the situation where participants share the same ID space and different feature

participants' local data, a third party is needed to generate homomorphic
encryption key pairs and perform decryption operations. In this way, the third
party is granted the right to decrypt information related to model parameters.
However, it isn't easy to find such a credible entity in the real world.
Existing methods for solving this problem are either communication-intensive or
unsuitable for multi-party scenarios. By combining secret sharing and
homomorphic encryption, we propose a novel VFL framework without a third party
called EFMVFL, which supports flexible expansion to multiple participants with
low communication overhead and is applicable to generalized linear models. We
give instantiations of our framework under logistic regression and Poisson

result, the information of confident pseudo-labels can be effectively
propagated into more unlabeled samples during training by the well-clustered

minimizing use of computationally expensive exact/adaptive precision
arithmetic. Although our approach allows for nearly no limit on the degree of
self-intersection in the input surface, our focus is on efficiency in the most

their policies to achieve a shared goal. Previous studies mainly focus on
decentralized control to maximize a common reward and barely consider the
coordination among control policies, which is critical in dynamic and
complicated environments. In this work, we propose factorizing the joint team
policy into a graph generator and graph-based coordinated policy to enable
coordinated behaviours among agents. The graph generator adopts an
encoder-decoder framework that outputs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to
capture the underlying dynamic decision structure. We also apply the
DAGness-constrained and DAG depth-constrained optimization in the graph
generator to balance efficiency and performance. The graph-based coordinated
policy exploits the generated decision structure. The graph generator and
coordinated policy are trained simultaneously to maximize the discounted
return. Empirical evaluations on Collaborative Gaussian Squeeze, Cooperative
Navigation, and Google Research Football demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method.

movements with arbitrary speech input for any talking head video. Albeit
moderate improvements in current approaches, they commonly require high-quality
homologous data sources of videos and audios, thus causing the failure to
leverage heterogeneous data sufficiently. In practice, it may be intractable to
collect the perfect homologous data in some cases, for example, audio-corrupted
or picture-blurry videos. To explore this kind of data and support
high-fidelity few-shot visual dubbing, in this paper, we novelly propose a
simple yet efficient two-stage framework with a higher flexibility of mining
heterogeneous data. Specifically, our two-stage paradigm employs facial
landmarks as intermediate prior of latent representations and disentangles the
lip movements prediction from the core task of realistic talking head
generation. By this means, our method makes it possible to independently
utilize the training corpus for two-stage sub-networks using more available
heterogeneous data easily acquired. Besides, thanks to the disentanglement, our
framework allows a further fine-tuning for a given talking head, thereby
leading to better speaker-identity preserving in the final synthesized results.
Moreover, the proposed method can also transfer appearance features from others
to the target speaker. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method in generating highly realistic videos
synchronized with the speech over the state-of-the-art.

combining the stability, robustness, and physical interpretability of an

representational flexibility and optimised resulting performance provided by

disables OAM demultiplexing in fiber-optic communications. Here, a
deep-learning-based approach is developed to recover the data from scattered

exotic phenomena. Remarkably, there are mainly three features. Firstly, the
atomic spin-orbit coupling locks the electron spins to be out-of-plane, which
could give birth to the Type II Ising superconductivity with a large in-plane
upper critical field compared to the Pauli limit. Secondly, topological chiral
or helical Majorana edge state could be realized even in the absence of
external magnetic fields or Zeeman fields. In addition, a spin-polarized
superconducting state could even be generated by spin-singlet non-unitary
pairings with spontaneous time-reversal breaking, which severs as a smoking gun
to detect this exotic state by measuring the spin-resolved density of states.

facilities around the world, and new physics searches related to the muons are
expected. The facilities can observe the transverse positron polarization of
the polarized $\mu^+$ decay to test the standard model. The transition of
muonium into antimuonium (Mu-to-$\bar{\text{Mu}}$ transition), which is one of
the interesting possibilities in the models beyond the standard model, can be
also tested. The near-future observation of the transition gives us a great
impact since it indicates that there is an approximate discrete symmetry in the
lepton sector. If the Mu-to-$\bar{\text{Mu}}$ transition operator is generated,
a new muon decay operator can exist and it may interfere with the standard
model muon decay operator to induce the corrections to the transverse positron
polarization in the $\mu^+$ decay. In this paper, we examine the possibility
that the Mu-to-$\bar{\text{Mu}}$ transition and the correction to the
transverse positron polarization are related, and we show that those two are
related in the model of a neutral flavor gauge boson. We also investigate the
models to generate the Mu-to-$\bar{\text{Mu}}$ transition, such as an inert
$SU(2)_L$ doublet, a $SU(2)_L$ triplet for the type-II seesaw model, a dilepton
gauge boson, and a left-right model. The non-zero value of the transverse
polarization for one of the two directions, $P_{\rm T_2}$, violates the
time-reversal invariance, and the experimental constraint of the electron

developed for the downlink operation in LEO massive MIMO satellite
communications, by exploiting the slow-varying statistical channel state
information (CSI) at the transmitter. First, we formulate the hybrid precoder
design as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by considering both
the continuous and discrete phase shift networks for implementing the analog
precoder. The cases of both the fully and the partially connected architectures
are considered. Since the EE optimization problem is nonconvex, it is in
general difficult to solve. To make the EE maximization problem tractable, we
apply a closed-form tight upper bound to approximate the ergodic rate. Then, we
develop an efficient algorithm to obtain the fully digital precoders. Based on
which, we further develop two different efficient algorithmic solutions to
compute the hybrid precoders for the fully and the partially connected
architectures, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed
approaches achieve significant EE performance gains over the existing
baselines, especially when the discrete phase shift network is employed for
analog precoding.

definition of the notion of strong Frobenius structure for $q$-difference

The first one deals with \emph{confluence}. We show that if the $q$-difference
operator $L_q$ has a strong Frobenius structure for a prime $p$ with period $h$
and if $L$ is the $p$-adic differential operator obtained from $L_q$ by letting
$q$ tend to 1, then $L$ has a strong Frobenius structure for $p$ with period
$h$. The second one deals with congruence modulo cyclotomic polynomials. We
show that if $f(q,z)\in\mathbb{Z}[q][[z]]$ is a solution of a $q$-difference
operator having strong Frobenius structure for $p$ then $f(q,z)$ satisfies some
congruences modulo the $p$-th cyclotomic polynomial. Another definition of
strong Frobenius structures associated with $q$-difference operators has been
introduced by Andr\'e and Di Vizio and we also point out why their definition
is not suitable for our applications: confluence and congruence modulo
cyclotomic polynomials. Finally, we show that some $q$-hypergeometric operators

transmission dynamics with mutation and imperfect vaccination. It is also
assumed that the recuperated individuals from the native strain can be infected
with mutant strain through the direct contact with individual or contaminated
surfaces or aerosols. We compute the basic reproduction number for each strain
independently and take the maximum for $R_0$. We prove the nonexistence of
backward bifurcation using the center manifold theory, and global stability of
disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number $R_0<1. An
intermediate mutation rate $\nu_1$ leads to oscillations. When $\nu_1$
increases over a threshold, the system regains its stability and exhibits an
interesting dynamics called endemic bubble. An analytical expression for
vaccine-induced herd immunity is derived. The model is parameterized using the
Indian data of the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19
from March 1 to September 27 in 2021, using MCMC method. The cumulative cases
and deaths can be reduced by increasing the vaccine efficacies to both native

native strain as 90\%, the cumulative cases and deaths would be reduced by
3.27\% and 5.2\%, respectively; and by considering the vaccine efficacy to
mutant strain as 90\%, the cumulative cases and deaths would be reduced by

geopotential difference determination based on frequency comparisons between
two remote hydrogen atomic clocks, with the help of common-view satellite time
transfer (CVSTT) technique. For the first time we apply the ensemble empirical
mode decomposition (EEMD) technique to the CVSTT observations for effectively
determining the geopotential-related signals. Based on the net frequency shift
between the two clocks in two different periods, the geopotential difference
between stations of the Beijing 203 Institute Laboratory (BIL) and Luojiashan

orthometric height (OH) of LTS determined by the clock comparison is deviated

The results are consistent with the frequency stabilities of the hydrogen

have sufficient spare resources to allow deployment of machine learning methods
for improving identification of muon candidates and searching for new exotic
particles. Our neural network regression model promises to improve rejection of
the dominant source of background trigger events in the central detector
region, which are due to muon candidates with low transverse momenta. This
model was implemented in FPGA using 157 digital signal processors and about
5,000 lookup tables. The simulated network latency and deadtime are 122 and 25

impact of design choices on resource utilisation and latency. The performance
parameters of our FPGA implementation are well within the requirements of the

classification benchmark dataset with a natural temporal evolution of visual
concepts in the real world that spans a decade (2004-2014). We build CLEAR from
existing large-scale image collections (YFCC100M) through a novel and scalable
low-cost approach to visio-linguistic dataset curation. Our pipeline makes use
of pretrained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) to interactively build labeled
datasets, which are further validated with crowd-sourcing to remove errors and
even inappropriate images (hidden in original YFCC100M). The major strength of
CLEAR over prior CL benchmarks is the smooth temporal evolution of visual
concepts with real-world imagery, including both high-quality labeled data
along with abundant unlabeled samples per time period for continual
semi-supervised learning. We find that a simple unsupervised pre-training step
can already boost state-of-the-art CL algorithms that only utilize
fully-supervised data. Our analysis also reveals that mainstream CL evaluation
protocols that train and test on iid data artificially inflate performance of
CL system. To address this, we propose novel ""streaming"" protocols for CL that
always test on the (near) future. Interestingly, streaming protocols (a) can
simplify dataset curation since today's testset can be repurposed for
tomorrow's trainset and (b) can produce more generalizable models with more
accurate estimates of performance since all labeled data from each time-period
is used for both training and testing (unlike classic iid train-test splits).

locations at the Macao Food Festival. The optimal layout diagram may be defined
in such a way that, while requiring the distance between every pair of stands
should not be too far away from each other, the crowd control is well managed
so that people may patronize stands more effectively. More popular stands may
have larger patronage, resulting in higher pedestrian flow nearby. Therefore,
to avoid customers from packing shoulder to shoulder around more popular
stands, we may treat every stand as a charged particle carrying an effective
charge: the more popular a stand is, the higher the effective charge it
carries. Under this assumption, the problem is then converted to the
minimization problem of Coulomb electrostatic potential energy on a specific
configuration of charge locations, with which the global minimum may be found
by the Simulated Annealing and Metropolis Algorithm. Electrostatic energy
density is interpreted as density of customers, while electric field the
reversed crowd flow. Therefore, at a certain location we are able to predict
the customer density by calculating the energy density and the net crowd flow
with electric field lines. We also concluded that even though the required
computation time to obtain a configuration of stand locations with the energy
value close to the global minimum with a tolerable difference may be irrelevant
to the randomly generated initial configuration of stand locations, setting up
an appropriate initial configuration could be one of the key issues to find out
the actual global minimum.

have the properties of strong diffraction and low attenuation and contribute
the most to the incident wave fields impinging on nearby buildings. By
formulating the interaction problem between the tunnel-ground and

evaluated considering the effects of soil compliance and superstructure. The
performance depends on the dynamic properties of the ground, foundation, and

separated into time-independent tensorial coefficients and four kind of
time-dependent scalar functions. Accordingly, the first and second integration
of geodesic equation can be reduced in each case to only four kind of scalar
master integrals. These integrals can be solved in closed form by recurrence
relations. The 2PN terms of monopole and quadrupole contribute less than $1$
nano-arcsecond to the total light deflection. There are, however, enhanced
terms in the 2PN light deflection, both in case of monopole and quadrupole.
These enhanced 2PN terms are caused by the use of an impact vector which is

gap is derived in terms of the proposed task (dis)similarity measure, two
R$\'e$nyi mutual information terms between classical input and quantum
embedding under source and target tasks, as well as a measure of complexity of
the combined space of quantum embeddings and classifiers under the source task.
The theoretical results are validated on a simple binary classification

distributed computing systems by introducing redundant computation and creating
multicasting opportunities. The optimal computation-communication tradeoff has
been well studied for homogeneous systems, and some results have been obtained
under heterogeneous conditions. However, the existing schemes require delicate
data placement and output function assignment, which is not feasible in some
practical scenarios when distributed nodes fetch data without the orchestration
of a central server. In this paper, we consider the general heterogeneous
distributed computing systems where the data placement and output function
assignment are arbitrary but pre-set (i.e., cannot be designed by schemes). For
this general heterogeneous setup, we propose two coded computing schemes,
One-Shot Coded Transmission (OSCT) and Few-Shot Coded Transmission (FSCT), to
reduce the communication load. These two schemes first group the nodes into
clusters and divide the transmission of each cluster into multiple rounds, and
then design coded transmission in each round to maximize the multicast gain.
The key difference between OSCT and FSCT is that the former uses a one-shot
transmission where each encoded message can be decoded independently by the
intended nodes, while the latter allows each node to jointly decode multiple
received symbols to achieve potentially larger multicast gains. Furthermore,
with theoretical converse proofs, we derive sufficient conditions for the
optimality of OSCT and FSCT, respectively. This not only recovers the existing
optimality results known for homogeneous systems and 3-node systems, but also
includes some cases where our schemes are optimal while other existing methods
are not.

recognition models. An effective approach is to select informative content from
the holistic video, yielding a popular family of dynamic video recognition
methods. However, existing dynamic methods focus on either temporal or spatial
selection independently while neglecting a reality that the redundancies are
usually spatial and temporal, simultaneously. Moreover, their selected content
is usually cropped with fixed shapes, while the realistic distribution of
informative content can be much more diverse. With these two insights, this
paper proposes to integrate temporal and spatial selection into an Action
Keypoint Network (AK-Net). From different frames and positions, AK-Net selects
some informative points scattered in arbitrary-shaped regions as a set of
action keypoints and then transforms the video recognition into point cloud
classification. AK-Net has two steps, i.e., the keypoint selection and the
point cloud classification. First, it inputs the video into a baseline network
and outputs a feature map from an intermediate layer. We view each pixel on
this feature map as a spatial-temporal point and select some informative
keypoints using self-attention. Second, AK-Net devises a ranking criterion to
arrange the keypoints into an ordered 1D sequence. Consequentially, AK-Net
brings two-fold benefits for efficiency: The keypoint selection step collects
informative content within arbitrary shapes and increases the efficiency for
modeling spatial-temporal dependencies, while the point cloud classification
step further reduces the computational cost by compacting the convolutional
kernels. Experimental results show that AK-Net can consistently improve the
efficiency and performance of baseline methods on several video recognition

with a slice selection method suitable for the shortest-lived tissues in the
body.
  Methods: We introduce two new sequences that integrate spin-locking pulses
into standard ZTE imaging to achieve slice selection: one for moderately short
$T_2$ (DiSLoP), the other for ultra-short $T_2$ samples (PreSLoP). These
methods exploit the slower signal decay (at $T_{1\rho}\gg T_2$) to retain the
magnetization in the slices during the selection process, which is otherwise
comparable to or even much longer than $T_2$.
  Results: We demonstrate control over the slice profiles and positions for 2D
imaging. We measure magnetization decay times during spin-locking ($T_{1\rho}$)
as a function of pulse amplitude, showing significant lifetime enhancement for
amplitudes as low as 10 uT. We show imaging of slice-selected samples with
$T_2$ characteristic times in the range of single milliseconds with DiSLoP and
PreSLoP, and with the latter for sub-millisecond $T_2$ tissues. As compared to
standard 3D ZTE sequences, PreSLoP achieves the same signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) in 2-5 times shorter scan times, and we argue that this is due to the
filling scheme of the finite gap at the center of $k$-space unavoidable with
ZTE sequences. Finally, we discuss a combination of DiSLoP with a dynamical
decoupling sequence to avoid this central gap, leading to further scan time
accelerations.
  Conclusions: The proposed sequences are capable of slice-selected 2D imaging
of tissues with $T_2$ as low as 275 us with good SNR within clinically
acceptable scan times.

typically stated as a bipartite graph matching problem and often solved by
applying minimum-cost flow techniques, which may be computationally inefficient

local solutions, rather than finding a global solution at once. Other key issue
is that of the affinity measurement: the widespread usage of non-learnable

proposes an efficient approach for cross-cameras data-association focused on a
global solution, instead of processing cameras by pairs. To avoid the usage of
fixed distances, we leverage the connectivity of Graph Neural Networks,
previously unused in this scope, using a Message Passing Network to jointly
learn features and similarity. We validate the proposal for pedestrian

Similar to human infants, artificial agents can learn language while

model that bidirectionally binds robot actions and their language descriptions
in a simple object manipulation scenario. Building on our previous Paired
Variational Autoencoders (PVAE) model, we demonstrate the superiority of the
variational autoencoder over standard autoencoders by experimenting with cubes
of different colours, and by enabling the production of alternative
vocabularies. Additional experiments show that the model's channel-separated
visual feature extraction module can cope with objects of different shapes.
Next, we introduce PVAE-BERT, which equips the model with a pretrained
large-scale language model, i.e., Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (BERT), enabling the model to go beyond comprehending only the
predefined descriptions that the network has been trained on; the recognition
of action descriptions generalises to unconstrained natural language as the
model becomes capable of understanding unlimited variations of the same
descriptions. Our experiments suggest that using a pretrained language model as

interfere with the information signals and cause their nonlinear distortion.
The sources and basic mechanisms of PIM were studied in literature but PIM
remains a serious problem of signal integrity. In this paper, the main sources
and mechanisms of PIM generation by joints of good conductors are discussed. It
is shown that the passive electrical, thermal and mechanical nonlinearities are
intrinsically linked despite their distinctively different time scales. The
roughness of the contact surfaces plays an important role in PIM generation by
conductor joints. A review of the PIM phenomenology at contacts of the good

correlation length that depends on the binormal wavenumber $k_\perp$ selected
by the Doppler backscattering (DBS) signal. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations
show that the turbulence naturally exhibits a non-separable power law spectrum
in wavenumber space, leading to a power law dependence of the radial
correlation length with binormal wavenumber $l_r \sim C k_\perp^{-\alpha}
(\alpha \approx 1)$ which agrees with the inverse proportionality relationship
between the measured $l_r$ and $k_\perp $ in experiments (Fernandez-Marina et

characterizing the eddy aspect ratio in the perpendicular plane to the magnetic
field and motivates future use of a non-separable turbulent spectrum to
quantitatively interpret RCDR and potentially other turbulence diagnostics. The
radial correlation length is only measurable when the radial resolution at the
cutoff location $W_n$ satisfies $W_n \ll l_r$, while the measurement becomes
dominated by $W_n$ for $W_n \gg l_r$. This suggests that $l_r$ is likely
inaccessible for electron-scale DBS measurements ($k_\perp\rho_s > 1$). The
effect of $W_n$ on ion-scale radial correlation lengths could be
non-negligible.

programs. Instead of analyzing all behaviors of a program, these techniques
detect errors by focusing on a single program execution. Often a crucial step
in these techniques is to define a causal ordering between events in the
execution, which is then computed using vector clocks, a simple data structure
that stores logical times of threads. The two basic operations of vector
clocks, namely join and copy, require $\Theta(k)$ time, where $k$ is the number
of threads. Thus they are a computational bottleneck when $k$ is large.
  In this work, we introduce tree clocks, a new data structure that replaces
vector clocks for computing causal orderings in program executions. Joining and
copying tree clocks takes time that is roughly proportional to the number of
entries being modified, and hence the two operations do not suffer the a-priori
$\Theta(k)$ cost per application. We show that when used to compute the classic
happens-before (HB) partial order, tree clocks are optimal, in the sense that
no other data structure can lead to smaller asymptotic running time. Moreover,
we demonstrate that tree clocks can be used to compute other partial orders,
such as schedulable-happens-before (SHB) and the standard Mazurkiewicz (MAZ)
partial order, and thus are a versatile data structure. Our experiments show
that just by replacing vector clocks with tree clocks, the computation becomes
from $2.02 \times$ faster (MAZ) to $2.66 \times$ (SHB) and $2.97 \times$ (HB)
on average per benchmark. These results illustrate that tree clocks have the
potential to become a standard data structure with wide applications in
concurrent analyses.

  Communications, May 2022",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Today's radio access networks (RANs) are monolithic entities which often
operate statically on a given set of parameters for the entirety of their
operations. To implement realistic and effective spectrum sharing policies,
RANs will need to seamlessly and intelligently change their operational
parameters. In stark contrast with existing paradigms, the new O-RAN
architectures for 5G-and-beyond networks (NextG) separate the logic that
controls the RAN from its hardware substrate, allowing unprecedented real-time
fine-grained control of RAN components. In this context, we propose the
Channel-Aware Reactive Mechanism (ChARM), a data-driven O-RAN-compliant
framework that allows (i) sensing the spectrum to infer the presence of
interference and (ii) reacting in real time by switching the distributed unit
(DU) and radio unit (RU) operational parameters according to a specified
spectrum access policy. ChARM is based on neural networks operating directly on
unprocessed I/Q waveforms to determine the current spectrum context. ChARM does
not require any modification to the existing 3GPP standards. It is designed to
operate within the O-RAN specifications, and can be used in conjunction with
other spectrum sharing mechanisms (e.g., LTE-U, LTE-LAA or MulteFire). We
demonstrate the performance of ChARM in the context of spectrum sharing among
LTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed bands, where a controller operating over a RAN
Intelligent Controller (RIC) senses the spectrum and switches cell frequency to
avoid Wi-Fi. We develop a prototype of ChARM using srsRAN, and leverage the
Colosseum channel emulator to collect a large-scale waveform dataset to train
our neural networks with. Experimental results show that ChARM achieves
accuracy of up to 96% on Colosseum and 85% on an over-the-air testbed,
demonstrating the capacity of ChARM to exploit the considered spectrum
channels.

properties of the penalized maximum likelihood estimators (pMLE) and of the
posterior distribution for parametric models in a non-asymptotic setup and for
possibly large or even infinite parameter dimension. We consider a special
class of stochastically linear smooth (SLS) models satisfying two major
conditions: the stochastic component of the log-likelihood is linear in the
model parameter, while the expected log-likelihood is a smooth function. The
main results simplify a lot if the expected log-likelihood is concave. For the
pMLE, we establish a number of finite sample bounds about its concentration and
large deviations as well as the Fisher and Wilks expansion. The later results
extend the classical asymptotic Fisher and Wilks Theorems about the MLE to the
non-asymptotic setup with large parameter dimension which can depend on the
sample size. For the posterior distribution, our main result states a Gaussian
approximation of the posterior which can be viewed as a finite sample analog of
the prominent Bernstein--von Mises Theorem. In all bounds, the remainder is
given explicitly and can be evaluated in terms of the effective sample size and
effective parameter dimension. The results are dimension and coordinate free.
In spite of generality, all the presented bounds are nearly sharp and the
classical asymptotic results can be obtained as simple corollaries. Interesting
cases of logit regression and of estimation of a log-density with smooth or
truncation priors are used to specify the results and to explain the main
notions.

data often displays biases against specific groups of people which have been
underprivileged in the recent past, or still are. In this context, one of the
possible approaches is to employ fair representation learning algorithms which
are able to remove biases from data, making groups statistically
indistinguishable. In this paper, we instead develop a fair representation
learning algorithm which is able to map individuals belonging to different
groups in a single group. This is made possible by training a pair of
Normalizing Flow models and constraining them to not remove information about
the ground truth by training a ranking or classification model on top of them.
The overall, ``chained'' model is invertible and has a tractable Jacobian,
which allows to relate together the probability densities for different groups
and ``translate'' individuals from one group to another. We show experimentally
that our methodology is competitive with other fair representation learning
algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves stronger invariance w.r.t. the
sensitive attribute.

supporting spatial manipulation of objects on a slide, creating animations, and

results in significantly faster target slide identification times compared to a

polyanions from monoanions in a molecular beam. As a characteristic feature of
this modular setup, the further charging process via sequential electron
attachment within a 3-state digital trap takes place after mass-selection. In
contrast to other approaches, the rf based concept permits to access heavy
particles. The procedure is highly flexible with respect to the preparation
process and potentially suitable for a wide variety of anionic species. By
adjusting the storage conditions, i.e., the radio frequency, to the change in
the mass-to-charge ratio, we succeeded to produce clusters in highly negative

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Monocular height estimation (MHE) from remote sensing imagery has high
potential in generating 3D city models efficiently for a quick response to
natural disasters. Most existing works pursue higher performance. However,
there is little research exploring the interpretability of MHE networks. In
this paper, we target at exploring how deep neural networks predict height from
a single monocular image. Towards a comprehensive understanding of MHE
networks, we propose to interpret them from multiple levels: 1) Neurons:
unit-level dissection. Exploring the semantic and height selectivity of the
learned internal deep representations; 2) Instances: object-level
interpretation. Studying the effects of different semantic classes, scales, and
spatial contexts on height estimation; 3) Attribution: pixel-level analysis.
Understanding which input pixels are important for the height estimation. Based
on the multi-level interpretation, a disentangled latent Transformer network is
proposed towards a more compact, reliable, and explainable deep model for
monocular height estimation. Furthermore, a novel unsupervised semantic
segmentation task based on height estimation is first introduced in this work.
Additionally, we also construct a new dataset for joint semantic segmentation
and height estimation. Our work provides novel insights for both understanding
and designing MHE models.

This work presents the first 3D few-shot interclass segmentation network for
medical images, using a labelled multi-institution dataset from prostate cancer
patients with eight regions of interest. We propose an image alignment module
registering the predicted segmentation of both query and support data, in a
standard prototypical learning algorithm, to a reference atlas space. The
built-in registration mechanism can effectively utilise the prior knowledge of
consistent anatomy between subjects, regardless whether they are from the same
institution or not. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed
registration-assisted prototypical learning significantly improved segmentation
accuracy (p-values<0.01) on query data from a holdout institution, with varying
availability of support data from multiple institutions. We also report the
additional benefits of the proposed 3D networks with 75% fewer parameters and
an arguably simpler implementation, compared with existing 2D few-shot

polaron in these materials is still a challenge task. Herein, we theoretically
present the infrared optical absorption of Frohlich polaron based on Huang-Rhys
model. We find that multiphonon overtones are appeared as the energy of
incident photon matches the multiple LO phonons, wherein the average phonon
numbers of a polaron can be directly evaluated by the order of the strongest
overtone. These multiphonon structures sensitively depend on the scale of
electronic distribution in the ground state and the dimensionality of the
perovskite materials, which gives the enlightenment for the effective
modulation of competing processes between the polaron formation and carrier
cooling. Moreover, the order of the strongest overtone shifts to the higher
ones with temperature, providing a potential proof of the carriers mobility
affected by LO phonons scattering. The present model not only suggests a direct
way to verify Frohlich polaron, but also enriches the understanding of the
polaron properties in metal halide perovskites.

infrastructure. Electronic Control Units (ECUs) exchange data across a shared
bus, dropping messages whenever errors occur. If an ECU generates enough
errors, their transmitter is put in a bus-off state, turning it off. Previous
work abuses this process to disable ECUs, but is trivial to detect through the
multiple errors transmitted over the bus. We propose a novel attack,
undetectable by prior intrusion detection systems, which disables ECUs within a
single message without generating any errors on the bus. Performing this attack
requires the ability to flip bits on the bus, but not with any level of
sophistication. We show that an attacker who can only flip bits 40% of the time
can execute our stealthy attack 100% of the time. But this attack, and all
prior CAN attacks, rely on the ability to read the bus. We propose a new
technique which synchronizes the bus, such that even a blind attacker,
incapable of reading the bus, can know when to transmit. Taking a limited
attacker's chance of success from the percentage of dead bus time, to 100%.
Finally, we propose a small modification to the CAN error process to ensure an
ECU cannot fail without being detected, no matter how advanced the attacker is.
Taken together we advance the state of the art for CAN attacks and blind
attackers, while proposing a detection system against stealthy attacks, and the
larger problem of CAN's abusable error frames.

tool in a variety of graph-related applications. However, the performance of
GNNs can be deteriorated when noisy connections occur in the original graph
structures; besides, the dependence on explicit structures prevents GNNs from
being applied to general unstructured scenarios. To address these issues,
recently emerged deep graph structure learning (GSL) methods propose to jointly
optimize the graph structure along with GNN under the supervision of a node
classification task. Nonetheless, these methods focus on a supervised learning
scenario, which leads to several problems, i.e., the reliance on labels, the
bias of edge distribution, and the limitation on application tasks. In this
paper, we propose a more practical GSL paradigm, unsupervised graph structure
learning, where the learned graph topology is optimized by data itself without
any external guidance (i.e., labels). To solve the unsupervised GSL problem, we
propose a novel StrUcture Bootstrapping contrastive LearnIng fraMEwork (SUBLIME
for abbreviation) with the aid of self-supervised contrastive learning.
Specifically, we generate a learning target from the original data as an
""anchor graph"", and use a contrastive loss to maximize the agreement between
the anchor graph and the learned graph. To provide persistent guidance, we
design a novel bootstrapping mechanism that upgrades the anchor graph with
learned structures during model learning. We also design a series of graph
learners and post-processing schemes to model the structures to learn.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant
effectiveness of our proposed SUBLIME and high quality of the optimized graphs.

highly efficient Convolutional Neural Network~ (CNN) quantization with high
performance. Previous PTQ methods usually reduce compression error via
performing layer-by-layer parameters calibration. However, with lower
representational ability of extremely compressed parameters (e.g., the
bit-width goes less than 4), it is hard to eliminate all the layer-wise errors.
This work addresses this issue via proposing a unit-wise feature reconstruction
algorithm based on an observation of second order Taylor series expansion of
the unit-wise error. It indicates that leveraging the interaction between
adjacent layers' parameters could compensate layer-wise errors better. In this
paper, we define several adjacent layers as a Basic-Unit, and present a
unit-wise post-training algorithm which can minimize quantization error. This
method achieves near-original accuracy on ImageNet and COCO when quantizing
FP32 models to INT4 and INT3.

self-supervised techniques under the generic assumption that the most abstract
features are those which are statistically most over-represented in comparison
to other distributions from the same domain. In this work, we show that
self-distillation of the in-distribution training set together with contrasting

how the negative samples are generated. In particular, we observe that by
leveraging negative samples, which keep the statistics of low-level features
while changing the high-level semantics, higher average detection performance
is obtained. Furthermore, good negative sampling strategies can be identified
from the sensitivity of the OOD detection score. The efficiency of our approach
is demonstrated across a diverse range of OOD detection problems, setting new

directly applied to Multidimensional Projections (MDP), as they hardly escape
from False and Missing Neighbors distortions that make the relative positions

Distortion-aware brushing, a novel brushing technique for MDP. While users
perform brushing, Distortion-aware brushing resolves distortions around
currently brushed points by dynamically relocating points in the projection;
the points whose data are close to the brushed data in the multidimensional

outperforms previous brushing techniques in precisely separating clusters in

measuring fairness for modern models and datasets is becoming increasingly
difficult as they grow at an unprecedented pace. One key challenge in scaling
common fairness metrics to such models and datasets is the requirement of
exhaustive ground truth labeling, which cannot always be done. Indeed, this
often rules out the application of traditional analysis metrics and systems. At
the same time, ML-fairness assessments cannot be made algorithmically, as
fairness is a highly subjective matter. Thus, domain experts need to be able to
extract and reason about bias throughout models and datasets to make informed
decisions. While visual analysis tools are of great help when investigating
potential bias in DL models, none of the existing approaches have been designed
for the specific tasks and challenges that arise in large label spaces.
Addressing the lack of visualization work in this area, we propose guidelines
for designing visualizations for such large label spaces, considering both
technical and ethical issues. Our proposed visualization approach can be
integrated into classical model and data pipelines, and we provide an
implementation of our techniques open-sourced as a TensorBoard plug-in. With
our approach, different models and datasets for large label spaces can be

released the measurements of the $e^+ e^- \to \omega\pi^0$ and $e^+ e^- \to

behaviors of the $\rho$ meson family around 2.0 GeV, we identify the
enhancement structure near 2034 MeV observed in $e^+e^-\to\omega\pi^0$ to be
the interference contribution from two resonances $\rho(1900)$ and

ciphers. In this paper, we propose an improved degree evaluation method and a
superpoly recovery technique, both of which are important in the cube attack.
The algebraic degree of the cryptosystem could be not only used to judge
whether the superpoly is zero, but also used to search for good cube indices
set, and the estimation of which has always been a topic of concern in
algebraic attacks. To improve accuracy of degree evaluation, we introduce the
concept of vector degree for a Boolean function and propose the vector numeric
mapping technique which aims to describe the propagation of the vector degree.
Recovering superpoly of the cube is the key step in the preprocessing phase of
cube attack. Three-subset division property without unknown subset has been an
efficient tool in recovering the exact superpoly by studying the division
trails. It is convenient to use off-the-shelf MILP solver to search all
division trails by transforming the division property into a MILP model. But
when there are too many division trails, it is difficult to find all solutions
by a MILP solver. We propose a method to simplify this problem through
combining the algebraic representations of the middle-round states in the
iterative process of a cipher. Thanks to the introduction of some new variables
instead of complex expressions of key bits and elimination of some trails in
the middle round, the number of solutions for a MILP model will be greatly
reduced. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we apply them to the
Trivium stream cipher. We find three cubes both of which have \texttt{zero-sum}
distinguisher till $840$ rounds. We also put forward $843$ and $844$-round
key-recovery attacks against Trivium with time complexity at most 2^{79.2} and

believed to originate from massive star core-collapse events, whereas
short-duration GRBs that are related to compact star mergers are expected to be
accompanied by kilonovae. GRB 211227A, which lasted about 84 s, had an initial
short/hard spike followed by a series of soft gamma-ray extended emission at
redshift $z=$0.228. We performed follow-up observations of the optical emission
using BOOTES, LCOGT, and the Lijiang 2.4m telescope, but we detected no
associated supernova signature, even down to very stringent limits at such a
low redshift. We observed the host galaxy within a large error-circle and
roughly estimate the physical offset of GRB 211227A as $20.47\pm14.47$ kpc from
the galaxy center. These properties are similar to those of GRB 060614, and
suggest that the progenitor of GRB 211227A is not favored to be associated with
the death of massive stars. Hence, we propose that GRB 211227A originates from
a compact star merger. Calculating pseudo-kilonova emission for this case by
adopting the typical parameters, we find that any associated pseudo-kilonova is
too faint to be detected. If this is the case, it explains naturally the
characteristics of the prompt emission, the lack of SN and kilonova emission,
and the large physical offset from the galaxy center.

ALMA observations reveal extremely compact emission (diameter ~1 kpc) that is
consistent with a simple, almost face-on, rotation-supported disk with a
significant velocity dispersion of ~160 km/s. The gas mass in just the central
200 pc is ~4x10^9 M_sun, about a factor two higher than that of the central
supermassive black hole. Consequently we do not resolve the black hole's sphere
of influence, and find no kinematic signature of the central supermassive black
hole. Kinematic modeling of the [CII] line shows that the dynamical mass at
large radii is consistent with the gas mass, leaving little room for a
significant mass contribution by stars and/or dark matter. The Toomre-Q
parameter is less than unity throughout the disk, and thus is conducive to star
formation, consistent with the high infrared luminosity of the system. The dust
in the central region is optically thick, at a temperature >132 K. Using
standard scaling relations of dust heating by star formation, this implies an
unprecedented high star formation rate density of >10^4 M_sun / yr / kpc^2.
Such a high number can still be explained with the Eddington limit for star
formation under certain assumptions, but could also imply that the central
supermassive black hole contributes to the heating of the dust in the central
110 pc.

bottleneck. To accelerate the communication, recent works introduce In-Network
Aggregation (INA), which moves the gradients summation into network

However, switch memory is scarce compared to the volume of gradients
transmitted in distributed training. Although literature applies methods like
pool-based streaming or dynamic sharing to tackle the mismatch, switch memory
is still a potential performance bottleneck. Furthermore, we observe the
under-utilization of switch memory due to the synchronization requirement for
aggregator deallocation in recent works. To improve the switch memory
utilization, we propose ESA, an $\underline{E}$fficient Switch Memory
$\underline{S}$cheduler for In-Network $\underline{A}$ggregation. At its cores,
ESA enforces the preemptive aggregator allocation primitive and introduces

develop a general framework involving differential-algebraic equations and
viability theory to determine coordination feasibility for a coordinated motion
control under heterogeneous vehicle dynamics and different types of
coordination task constraints. If a coordinated motion solution exists for the
derived differential-algebraic equations and/or inequalities, a constructive
algorithm is proposed to derive an equivalent dynamical system that generates a
set of feasible coordinated motions for each individual vehicle. In case
studies on coordinating two vehicles, we derive analytical solutions to motion
generation for two-vehicle groups consisting of car-like vehicles, unicycle
vehicles, or vehicles with constant speeds, which serve as benchmark
coordination tasks for more complex vehicle groups. The motion generation
algorithm is well-backed by simulation data for a wide variety of coordination
situations involving heterogeneous vehicles. We then extend the vehicle control
framework to deal with the cooperative coordination problem with time-varying
coordination tasks and leader-follower structure. We show several simulation
experiments on multi-vehicle coordination under various constraints to validate
the theory and the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

features that can guide automated game-playing agents. Such patterns or
features often represent particular configurations of pieces, empty positions,
etc., which may be relevant for a game's strategies. Their use has been
particularly prevalent in the game of Go, but also many other games used as
benchmarks for AI research. In this paper, we formulate a design and efficient
implementation of spatial state-action features for general games. These are
patterns that can be trained to incentivise or disincentivise actions based on
whether or not they match variables of the state in a local area around action
variables. We provide extensive details on several design and implementation
choices, with a primary focus on achieving a high degree of generality to
support a wide variety of different games using different board geometries or
other graphs. Secondly, we propose an efficient approach for evaluating active
features for any given set of features. In this approach, we take inspiration
from heuristics used in problems such as SAT to optimise the order in which
parts of patterns are matched and prune unnecessary evaluations. This approach
is defined for a highly general and abstract description of the problem --
phrased as optimising the order in which propositions of formulas in
disjunctive normal form are evaluated -- and may therefore also be of interest
to other types of problems than board games. An empirical evaluation on 33
distinct games in the Ludii general game system demonstrates the efficiency of
this approach in comparison to a naive baseline, as well as a baseline based on
prefix trees, and demonstrates that the additional efficiency significantly
improves the playing strength of agents using the features to guide search.

the discs as they evolve. We show how the initial properties of the cloud cores
affect the thermal history of the protoplanetary discs using a simple viscous

occurs within 0.5 AU. It increases with the initial cloud temperature and
decreases with its angular velocity and the viscosity of the disc. From the
observed properties of the molecular cloud cores we find the median value of
the maximum temperature is around 1250 K, with roughly 90% of them being less
than 1500 K - a value that is lower than the 50% condensation temperatures of
most refractory elements. Therefore, only cloud cores with high initial
temperatures or low angular velocities and/or low viscosities within the

the volatile depletion pattern of CM, CO, and CV chondrites and the terrestrial
planets in Solar system, one must either have rare properties of the initial

heat the disc to sufficiently high temperatures. Alternatively, the volatile
depletion observed in these chondrites may be inherited from the progenitor

generic energy storage (GES) resources provide low-cost, but uncertain,

different types of uncertainty, the literature mostly focuses on
decision-independent uncertainties (DIUs), such as exogenous stochastic
disturbances caused by weather conditions. Instead, this manuscript focuses on
newly-introduced decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) and considers an
optimal GES dispatch that accounts for uncertain available state-of-charge
(SoC) bounds that are affected by incentive signals and discomfort levels. To
incorporate DDUs, we present a novel chance-constrained optimization (CCO)
approach for the day-ahead economic dispatch of GES units. Two tractable
methods are presented to solve the proposed CCO problem with DDUs: (i) a robust
reformulation for general but incomplete distributions of DDUs, and (ii) an
iterative algorithm for specific and known distributions of DDUs. Furthermore,
reliability indices are introduced to verify the applicability of the proposed
approach with respect to the reliability of the response of GES units.
Simulation-based analysis shows that the proposed methods yield conservative,
but credible, GES dispatch strategies and reduced penalty cost by incorporating
DDUs in the constraints and leveraging data-driven parameter identification.
This results in improved availability and performance of coordinated GES units.

(the pointfree analogue of a topological semiring), we define a spectrum of R
which generalises the Stone spectrum of a distributive lattice, the Zariski
spectrum of a commutative ring, the Gelfand spectrum of a commutative unital
C*-algebra and the Hofmann-Lawson spectrum of a continuous frame. We then
provide an explicit construction of this spectrum under conditions on R which
are satisfied by our main examples.
  Our results are constructively valid and hence admit interpretation in any
elementary topos with natural number object. For this reason the spectrum we
construct should actually be a locale instead of a topological space.
  A simple modification to our construction gives rise to a quantic spectrum in
the form of a commutative quantale. Such a quantale contains `differential'
information in addition to the purely topological information of the localic
spectrum. In the case of a discrete ring, our construction produces the
quantale of ideals.

here we discuss in clear, straightforward terms why this trait implies a cosmos
with zero kinetic plus gravitational energy, though apparently not zero total
energy. Such an outcome has far reaching consequences because of the
possibility that the Universe may have begun its existence as a quantum
fluctuation. Was this from `nothing,' or perhaps a pre-existing vacuum? A
non-zero total energy would seemingly preclude the former scenario, but not
necessarily the latter, though this would then raise the question of how a
fluctuation with non-zero energy could have lived long enough, or
classicalized, for us to see it 13.5 billion years later. The high-precision
measurement of the Universe's spatial curvature may thus constitute the first
tangible piece of evidence impacting a possible quantum beginning.

Lyman-{\alpha} absorbers (ESDLAs, log N(Hi)>=21.7) observed with VLT-XShooter.
ESDLAs probe gas from within the star-forming disk of the associated galaxies
and thus ESDLAs provide a unique opportunity to study the interstellar medium
of galaxies at high-redshift. We report column densities (N), equivalent widths
(w), and the kinematic spread ({\Delta} v90) of species from neutral, singly
ionised, and higher ionisation species. We find that, using the dust correction
prescription, the measured metallicities are consistent for singly ionised gas
species such as Pii, S ii, Si ii, Mnii and Crii, and Znii in all ESDLAs within
3-sigma uncertainty. We find that the distributions of N(Ari)/N(Hi) ratio in
DLAs and ESDLAs are similar. We further report that ESDLAs do not show a strong
deficiency of Ari relative to other {\alpha}-capture elements as is seen in
DLAs. This supports the idea that the mentioned under-abundance of Ari in DLAs
is possibly caused by the presence of background UV photons that penetrate the
low N(Hi) clouds to ionise Ari, but they cannot penetrate deep enough in the
high N(Hi) ESDLA environment. The w(Mgii lambda2796) distribution in ESDLAs is
found to be similar to that of metal-rich Ci-selected absorbers, but the
velocity spread of their Mgii profile is different. For higher ionisation
species (such as C iv and Si iv), {\Delta} v90 is similar in the two
populations, while the {\Delta} v90 of singly ionised species is smaller for
ESDLAs. This suggests that the ESDLAs sample a different Hi region of their
associated galaxy compared to the general DLA population. We further study the
N(Cl i) distribution in high-redshift DLA and ESDLA sightlines, as Cl i is a
good tracer of H2 gas. The N(Cl i)-N(H2) correlation is followed by all the
clouds (ESDLAs and otherwise) having log N(H2)<22.

in computer vision. Inspired by the very versatile CycleGAN architecture, we
combine semantic segmentation with the concept of cycle consistency to enable a
multitask training protocol. However, learning is largely prevented by the
so-called steganography effect, which expresses itself as watermarks in the
latent segmentation domain, making image reconstruction a too easy task. To
combat this, we propose a noise injection, based either on quantization noise
or on Gaussian noise addition to avoid this disadvantageous information flow in
the cycle architecture. We find that noise injection significantly reduces the
generation of watermarks and thus allows the recognition of highly relevant
classes such as ""traffic signs"", which are hardly detected by the ERFNet
baseline. We report mIoU and PSNR results on the Cityscapes dataset for
semantic segmentation and image reconstruction, respectively. The proposed
methodology allows to achieve an mIoU improvement on the Cityscapes validation
set of 5.7% absolute over the same CycleGAN without noise injection, and still
an absolute 4.9% over the ERFNet non-cyclic baseline.

the proper functioning of cellular activities. Inspired by the diffusion of
active agents in crowded cellular channels, we computationally investigate the
transport of an active tracer through a polymer grafted cylindrical channel by
varying the activity of the tracer and stickiness of the tracer to the
polymers. Our results reveal that the passive tracer exhibits profound
subdiffusion with increasing stickiness by exploring deep into the grafted
polymeric zone, while purely repulsive one prefers to diffuse through the
pore-like space created along the cylindrical axis of the channel. In contrast,
the active tracer shows faster dynamics and intermediate superdiffusion even
though the tracer preferentially stays close to the dense polymeric region.
This observation is further supported by the sharp peaks in the density profile
of the probability of radial displacement of the tracer. We discover that the
activity plays an important role in deciding the pathway that the tracer takes
through the narrow channel. Interestingly, increasing the activity washes out
the effect of stickiness. Adding to this, van-Hove functions manifest that the
active tracer dynamics deviates from Gaussianity, and the degree of deviation
grows with the activity. Our work has direct implications on how effective
transportation and delivery of cargo can be achieved through a confined medium
where activity, interactions, and crowding are interplaying. Looking ahead,
these factors will be crucial for understanding the mechanism of artificial
self-powered machines navigating through the cellular channels and performing
in vivo challenging tasks.

fields participate in the inflation process in a unitary theory that predicts
values of the cosmological observables in agreement with the results from the
Planck/BICEP/Keck collaborations. In addition, by means of a $\mathcal{CP}$-odd
effective operator that couples $\phi$ to the Chern-Simons term of the
hypercharge gauge group as $f_\phi^{-1}\phi \,Y_{\mu\nu}\tilde Y^{\mu\nu}$,
maximally helical magnetic fields are produced during the last $e$-folds of
inflation. We found a window in the coupling $ f_\phi$ where these fields
survive all constraints until the electroweak phase transition, and source the
baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the Standard Model chiral anomaly.
From a phenomenological perspective, the model can solve the Standard Model
instability problem at the scale $\mathcal Q_I\simeq 10^{11}$ GeV, provided
that $\mu\lesssim m \lesssim \mathcal Q_I$, and for $m\lesssim

quartic couplings that could be explored at the HE-LHC, as well as at future

networks (DNN) for extracting bottleneck features, key considerations include
training targets, activation functions, and loss functions. In this paper, we
systematically study the impact of these choices on the performance of TD-SV.
For training targets, we consider speaker identity, time-contrastive learning
(TCL) and auto-regressive prediction coding with the first being supervised and
the last two being self-supervised. Furthermore, we study a range of loss
functions when speaker identity is used as the training target. With regard to
activation functions, we study the widely used sigmoid function, rectified
linear unit (ReLU), and Gaussian error linear unit (GELU). We experimentally
show that GELU is able to reduce the error rates of TD-SV significantly
compared to sigmoid, irrespective of training target. Among the three training
targets, TCL performs the best. Among the various loss functions, cross
entropy, joint-softmax and focal loss functions outperform the others. Finally,
score-level fusion of different systems is also able to reduce the error rates.

using short utterances. For the speaker classifications, the well-known
Gaussian mixture model-universal background model (GMM-UBM) and i-vector
techniques are used.

wearing facial masks, a common theme in the age of respiratory pandemics. An
intuitive partial remedy is to add a mask detector to flag any masked faces so
that the FRS can act accordingly for those low-confidence masked faces. In this
work, we set out to investigate the potential vulnerability of such FRS
equipped with a mask detector, on large-scale masked faces, which might trigger
a serious risk, e.g., letting a suspect evade the FRS where both facial
identity and mask are undetected. As existing face recognizers and mask
detectors have high performance in their respective tasks, it is significantly
challenging to simultaneously fool them and preserve the transferability of the
attack. We formulate the new task as the generation of realistic &
adversarial-faced mask and make three main contributions: First, we study the
naive Delanunay-based masking method (DM) to simulate the process of wearing a
faced mask that is cropped from a template image, which reveals the main
challenges of this new task. Second, we further equip the DM with the
adversarial noise attack and propose the adversarial noise Delaunay-based
masking method (AdvNoise-DM) that can fool the face recognition and mask
detection effectively but make the face less natural. Third, we propose the
adversarial filtering Delaunay-based masking method denoted as MF2M by
employing the adversarial filtering for AdvNoise-DM and obtain more natural
faces. With the above efforts, the final version not only leads to significant
performance deterioration of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based
FRS, but also remains undetected by the SOTA facial mask detector, thus
successfully fooling both systems at the same time.

calculations already published in the literature for the AA' bilayer, and
predict the excitonic conductivity of the AB bilayer, which remains largely
unstudied. The main difference in the conductivity of these two types of
bilayers is the appearance of a small, yet well resolved, resonance between two
larger ones in the AB configuration. This resonance is due to a mainly
interlayer exciton, and is absent in the AA' bilayer. Also, the conductivity of
the AB bilayer is due to both intralayer and interlayer excitons and is
dominated by p-states, while intralayer states are the relevant ones for the
AA' configuration, like in a monolayer. The effect of introducing a bias in the

deficient HII regions located in blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). In this
paper, we discuss in detail various methods of the determination of HII region
metallicity in the context of Y$_p$ analyses. We show that some procedures used
in the methods lead to biases in the metallicity estimates and underestimation
of their uncertainties. We propose a modified method for the metallicity
determination, as well as an additional criterion for selecting objects. We
have selected 69 objects (26 objects with high quality spectra from the
HeBCD+NIR database and 43 objects from the SDSS catalog), for which we estimate
Y and O/H using the proposed method. We have estimated Y$_p=0.2470\pm0.0020$
which is one of the most accurate estimates obtained up to date. Its comparison
with the value Y$_p=0.2470\pm0.0002$ obtained as a result of numerical
modelling of Primordial Nucleosynthesis with the value of $\Omega_b$ taken from
the analysis of the CMB anisotropy (Planck mission), is an important tool for
studying the self-consistency of the Standard cosmological model (a possible
discrepancy between these estimates could be an indicator of a new physics).
The application of the proposed method allows one to more correctly estimate
Y$_p$ and the slope $d$Y/$d$(O/H). Further analysis of the data from the SDSS
catalog can significantly increase the statistics of objects for the regression
analysis, which in turn can refine the Y$_p$ estimate.

as products of univariate polynomials that have matrices as coefficients. In an
attempt to understand the landscape of algebraic complexity classes surrounding
ROABPs, we study classes of ROABPs based on the algebraic structure of these
coefficient matrices. We study connections between polynomials computed by
these structured variants of ROABPs and other well-known classes of polynomials
(such as depth-three powering circuits, tensor-rank and Waring rank of
polynomials).
  Our main result concerns commutative ROABPs, where all coefficient matrices
commute with each other, and diagonal ROABPs, where all the coefficient
matrices are just diagonal matrices. In particular, we show a somewhat
surprising connection between these models and the model of depth-three
powering circuits that is related to the Waring rank of polynomials. We show
that if the dimension of partial derivatives captures Waring rank up to
polynomial factors, then the model of diagonal ROABPs efficiently simulates the
seemingly more expressive model of commutative ROABPs. Further, a commutative
ROABP that cannot be efficiently simulated by a diagonal ROABP will give an
explicit polynomial that gives a super-polynomial separation between dimension
of partial derivatives and Waring rank.
  Our proof of the above result builds on the results of Marinari, M\""oller and
Mora (1993), and M\""oller and Stetter (1995), that characterise rings of
commuting matrices in terms of polynomials that have small dimension of partial
derivatives. The algebraic structure of the coefficient matrices of these
ROABPs plays a crucial role in our proofs.

is a systematic process that helps in finding the right values for them. The
conventional methods for this purpose are grid search and random search and
both methods create issues in industrial-scale applications. Hence a set of
strategies have been recently proposed based on Bayesian optimization and
evolutionary algorithm principles that help in runtime issues in a production
environment and robust performance. In this paper, we compare the performance
of four python libraries, namely Optuna, Hyper-opt, Optunity, and sequential
model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC) that has been proposed for
hyper-parameter optimization. The performance of these tools is tested using
two benchmarks. The first one is to solve a combined algorithm selection and
hyper-parameter optimization (CASH) problem The second one is the NeurIPS
black-box optimization challenge in which a multilayer perception (MLP)
architecture has to be chosen from a set of related architecture constraints

From the experiments, we found that Optuna has better performance for CASH

it is difficult to perceive HFL contours on standard optical coherence
tomography (OCT) imaging. Due to its variable reflectivity under an imaging
beam, delineating the HFL contours necessitates directional OCT, which requires
additional imaging. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a
shape-preserving network, FourierNet, that achieves HFL segmentation in
standard OCT scans with the target performance obtained when directional OCT
scans are used. FourierNet is a new cascaded network design that puts forward
the idea of benefiting the shape prior of HFL in the network training. This
design proposes to represent the shape prior by extracting Fourier descriptors
on the HFL contours and defining an additional regression task of learning
these descriptors. It then formulates HFL segmentation as concurrent learning
of regression and classification tasks, in which Fourier descriptors are
estimated from an input image to encode the shape prior and used together with
the input image to construct the HFL segmentation map. Our experiments on 1470
images of 30 OCT scans reveal that quantifying the HFL shape with Fourier
descriptors and concurrently learning them with the main task of HFL
segmentation lead to better results. This indicates the effectiveness of
designing a shape-preserving network to improve HFL segmentation by reducing
the need to perform directional OCT imaging.

that no dynamical mass generation occurs. The same cannot be said for the

emerged as a powerful microscopy for studying weak stray field patterns with
nanometer resolution. Due to the internal crystal anisotropy of the spin
defect, however, external bias fields -- critical for the study of magnetic
materials -- must be applied along specific spatial directions. In particular,
the most common diamond probes made from {100}-cut diamond only support fields
at an angle of $\theta = 55^\circ$ from the surface normal. In this paper, we
report fabrication of scanning diamond probes from {110}-cut diamond where the
spin anisotropy axis lies in the scan plane ($\theta=90^\circ$). We show that
these probes retain their sensitivity in large in-plane fields and demonstrate
scanning magnetometry of the domain pattern of Co-NiO films in applied fields
up to 40 mT. Our work extends scanning NV magnetometry to the important class
of materials that require large in-plane fields.

continuous analogues of the standard Markov state models constructed using
master equations. A p-adic transition network (or an ultrametric network) is a
model of a complex system consisting of a hierarchical energy landscape, a
Markov process on the energy landscape, and a master equation. We focus on
networks where the transition rates between two different basins are constant
functions, and the jumping process inside of each basin is controlled by a
p-adic radial function. We solve explicitly the Cauchy problem for the master
equation attached to this type of networks. The solution of this problem is the
network response to a given initial concentration. If the Markov process
attached to the network is conservative, the long term response of the network
is controlled by a Markov chain. If the process is not conservative the network
has absorbing states. We define an absorbing time, which depends on the initial
concentration, if this time is finite the network reaches an absorbing state in
a finite time. We identify in the response of the network the terms responsible
for bringing the network to an absorbing state, we call them the fast
transition modes. The existence of the fast transition modes is a consequence
of the assumption that the energy landscape is ultrametric (hierarchical), and
to the best of our understanding this result cannot be obtained using standard
methods of Markov state models. Nowadays, it is widely accepted that protein
native states are kinetic hubs that can be reached quickly from any other
state. The existence of fast transition modes implies that certain states on an
ultrametric network work as kinetic hubs.

EUHFORIA. The CME generating the ESP event is simulated by using the spheromak
model of EUHFORIA, which approximates the CME's flux rope as a linear
force-free spheroidal magnetic field. In addition, a tool was developed to
trace CME-driven shock waves in the EUHFORIA simulation domain. This tool is
used in PARADISE to (i) inject 50 keV protons continuously at the CME-driven
shock and (ii) include a foreshock and a sheath region, in which the energetic
particle parallel mean free path, $\lambda_\parallel$, decreases towards the
shock wave. The value of $\lambda_\parallel$ at the shock wave is estimated
from in situ observations of the ESP event. For energies below 1 MeV, the
simulation results agree well with both the upstream and downstream components
of the ESP event observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE). This
suggests that these low-energy protons are mainly the result of interplanetary

attracted much attention in recent years. Previous methods performed the
expressive speech synthesis either with explicit labels or with a fixed-length
style embedding extracted from reference audio, both of which can only learn an
average style and thus ignores the multi-scale nature of speech prosody. In
this paper, we propose MsEmoTTS, a multi-scale emotional speech synthesis
framework, to model the emotion from different levels. Specifically, the
proposed method is a typical attention-based sequence-to-sequence model and
with proposed three modules, including global-level emotion presenting module
(GM), utterance-level emotion presenting module (UM), and local-level emotion
presenting module (LM), to model the global emotion category, utterance-level
emotion variation, and syllable-level emotion strength, respectively. In
addition to modeling the emotion from different levels, the proposed method
also allows us to synthesize emotional speech in different ways, i.e.,
transferring the emotion from reference audio, predicting the emotion from
input text, and controlling the emotion strength manually. Extensive
experiments conducted on a Chinese emotional speech corpus demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms the compared reference audio-based and text-based
emotional speech synthesis methods on the emotion transfer speech synthesis and
text-based emotion prediction speech synthesis respectively. Besides, the
experiments also show that the proposed method can control the emotion
expressions flexibly. Detailed analysis shows the effectiveness of each module
and the good design of the proposed method.

would complement any electromagnetic signal. However, the construction of
binary neutron star postmerger waveforms is much more complicated than for
binary black holes: (i) there are theoretical uncertainties in the neutron-star
equation of state and other aspects of the high-density physics, (ii) numerical
simulations are expensive and available ones only cover a small fraction of the
parameter space with limited numerical accuracy, and (iii) it is unclear how to
parametrize the theoretical uncertainties and interpolate across parameter
space. In this work, we describe the use of a machine-learning method called a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to construct postmerger models for
hyper/massive neutron star remnant signals based on numerical-relativity
simulations. The CVAE provides a probabilistic model, which encodes
uncertainties in the training data within a set of latent parameters. We
estimate that training such a model will ultimately require $\sim 10^4$

we show that the CVAE can be used as an accurate generative model and that it
encodes the equation of state in a useful latent representation.

used. Further, approximations for big data are developed that reduce the

counterfactuals, or because the experience was generated out of its own
control. However, off-policy learning is non-trivial, and standard
reinforcement-learning algorithms can be unstable and divergent.
  In this paper we discuss a novel family of off-policy prediction algorithms
which are convergent by construction. The idea is to first learn on-policy
about the data-generating behaviour, and then bootstrap an off-policy value
estimate on this on-policy estimate, thereby constructing a value estimate that
is partially off-policy. This process can be repeated to build a chain of value
functions, each time bootstrapping a new estimate on the previous estimate in
the chain. Each step in the chain is stable and hence the complete algorithm is
guaranteed to be stable. Under mild conditions this comes arbitrarily close to
the off-policy TD solution when we increase the length of the chain. Hence it
can compute the solution even in cases where off-policy TD diverges.
  We prove that the proposed scheme is convergent and corresponds to an
iterative decomposition of the inverse key matrix. Furthermore it can be
interpreted as estimating a novel objective -- that we call a `k-step
expedition' -- of following the target policy for finitely many steps before
continuing indefinitely with the behaviour policy. Empirically we evaluate the
idea on challenging MDPs such as Baird's counter example and observe favourable
results.

users in morphologically rich languages. Smartphone keyboards typically support
features such as input decoding, corrections and predictions that all rely on
language models. For latency reasons, these operations happen on device, so the
models are of limited size and cannot easily cover all the words needed by
users for their daily tasks, especially in morphologically rich languages. In
particular, the compounding nature of Germanic languages makes their vocabulary
virtually infinite. Similarly, heavily inflecting and agglutinative languages
(e.g. Slavic, Turkic or Finno-Ugric languages) tend to have much larger
vocabularies than morphologically simpler languages, such as English or
Mandarin. We propose to model such languages with automatically selected
subword units annotated with what we call binding types, allowing the decoder
to know when to bind subword units into words. We show that this method brings
around 20% word error rate reduction in a variety of compounding languages.
This is more than twice the improvement we previously obtained with a more
basic approach, also described in the paper.

three flat regions are the inflation, early and late dark energy epochs. The
potential is obtained by a spontaneous breaking of scale invariance generated
by Non Riemannian Measures of integration (or Two Measures Theories (TMT)).We
define the scale invariant couplings of the scalar fields to the different
measures through exponential potentials. Spontaneous breaking of scale
invariance takes place when integrating the fields that define the measures.
When going to the Einstein frame we obtain: (i) An effective potential for the
scalar fields with three flat regions which allows for a unified description of
both early universe inflation (in the higher energy density flat region) as
well as of present dark energy epoch which can be realized with a double phase,
i.e., in two flat regions. (ii) In the slow roll inflation, only one field
combination the ``dilaton"", which transforms under scale transformations, has
non trivial dynamics, the orthogonal one, which is scale invariant remains
constant. (iv) In the late universe we define scale invariant couplings of Dark
Matter to the dilaton. These couplings define a matter induced potential for
the dilaton and extremizing this potential determines the scale invariant
scalar field, while all exotic non canonical behavior of the Dark Matter as
well as any possible $5^{th}$ force disappear. (v) We calculate the evolution
of the late universe under these conditions with the realization of two
different possible realizations of $\Lambda$CDM type scenarios depending of the
flat region in the late universe. These two phases could appear at different
times in the history of the universe.(vi) From the Planck data, we find the
constraints on the parameters during the inflationary epoch and these values
are used to obtain constraints relevant to the present epoch.

infrared (NIR) scattering surface, and the properties of the dust in the disc
surface and sublimation rim. The disc appears inclined at $67-71^{\circ}$, with
position angle, PA\,$=-1.0-0.6^{\circ}$, consistent with previous estimates.
The NIR scattering surface extends out to $\sim75\,$au and we infer an aspect
ratio, $h_{\rm{scat}}(r)/r\sim0.24$ in $J$-band; $\sim0.22$ in $H$-band. Our
GPI images and VLTI+CHARA NIR interferometry suggest that the disc surface
layers are populated by grains $\gtrsim \lambda/2\pi$ in size, indicating these
grains are aerodynamically supported against settling and/or the density of
smaller grains is relatively low. We demonstrate that our geometric analysis
provides a reasonable assessment of the height of the NIR scattering surface at
the outer edge of the disc and, if the inclination can be independently
constrained, has the potential to probe the flaring exponent of the scattering
surface in similarly inclined ($i\gtrsim70^{\circ}$) discs. In re-evaluating

In RTS, an offspring competes against the closest individual, with respect to
some distance measure, amongst $w$ (window size) population members (chosen
uniformly at random with replacement), to encourage competition within the same
niche. We prove that RTS finds both optima on ${\rm T{\small WO}M{\small AX}}$
efficiently if the window size $w$ is large enough. However, if $w$ is too
small, RTS fails to find both optima even in exponential time, with high

is more effective at preventing one niche from taking over the other. However,
this comes at the expense of a slower progress towards optima when a niche

  functionals with state constraints","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2201.06155",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Let $F(y):=\displaystyle\int_t^TL(s, y(s), y'(s))\,ds$ be a positive
functional (the ""energy""), unnecessarily autonomous, defined on the space of
Sobolev functions $W^{1,p}([t,T]; \mathbb R^n)$ ($p\ge 1$). We consider the
problem of minimizing $F$ among the functions $y$ that possibly satisfy one, or
both, end point conditions. In many applications, where the lack of regularity
or convexity or growth conditions does not ensure the existence of a minimizer
of $F$, it is important to be able to approximate the value of the infimum of
$F$ via a sequence of Lipschitz functions satisfying the given boundary
conditions. Sometimes, even with some polynomial, coercive and convex
Lagrangians in the velocity variable, thus ensuring the existence of a
minimizer in the given Sobolev space, this is not achievable: this fact is know
as the Lavrentiev phenomenon. The paper deals on the avoidance of the
Lavrentiev phenomenon under the validity of a further given state constraint of
the form $y(s)\in\mathcal S\subset\mathbb R^n$ for all $s\in [t,T]$.
  Given $y\in W^{1,p}([t,T];\mathbb R^n)$ with $F(y)<+\infty$ we give a
constructive recipe for building a sequence $(y_h)_h$ of Lipschitz
reparametrizations of $y$, sharing with $y$ the same boundary condition(s),
that converge in energy to $F(y)$. With respect to previous literature on the
subject, we distinguish the case of (just) one end point condition from that of
both, enlarge the class of Lagrangians that satisfy the sufficient conditions
and show that $(y_h)_h$ converge also in $W^{1,p}$ to $y$. Moreover, the
results apply also to extended valued Lagrangians whose effective domain is
bounded. The results gives new clues even when the Lagrangian is autonomous,
i.e., of the form $L(s,y,y')=\Lambda (y,y')$. The paper follows two recent
papers \[23, 24] of the author on the subject.

Furthermore, due to centralized control, they cannot scale to scenarios with a

NSGZero, to learn a non-exploitable policy in NSGs. NSGZero improves data
efficiency by performing planning with neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
Our main contributions are threefold. First, we design deep neural networks
(DNNs) to perform neural MCTS in NSGs. Second, we enable neural MCTS with
decentralized control, making NSGZero applicable to NSGs with many resources.
Third, we provide an efficient learning paradigm, to achieve joint training of
the DNNs in NSGZero. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, our method
achieves significantly better data efficiency and scalability.

hierarchical classifiers over a single convolutional backbone, and train it
end-to-end on a combination of pixel-labeled datasets, improving
generalizability and the number of recognizable semantic concepts. Chapter 3
focuses on enriching semantic segmentation with weak supervision and proposes a
weakly-supervised algorithm for training with bounding box-level and
image-level supervision instead of only with per-pixel supervision. The memory
and computational load challenges that arise from simultaneous training on
multiple datasets are addressed in Chapter 4. We propose two methodologies for
selecting informative and diverse samples from datasets with weak supervision
to reduce our networks' ecological footprint without sacrificing performance.
Motivated by memory and computation efficiency requirements, in Chapter 5, we
rethink simultaneous training on heterogeneous datasets and propose a universal
semantic segmentation framework. This framework achieves consistent increases
in performance metrics and semantic knowledgeability by exploiting various
scene understanding datasets. Chapter 6 introduces the novel task of part-aware
panoptic segmentation, which extends our reasoning towards holistic scene

communication technologies have the potential to transform mobile health for
remote monitoring of health parameters. However, the small form factor of the
wearable devices limits the battery size and operating lifetime. As a result,
the devices require frequent recharging, which has limited their widespread
adoption. Energy harvesting has emerged as an effective method towards
sustainable operation of wearable devices. Unfortunately, energy harvesting
alone is not sufficient to fulfill the energy requirements of wearable devices.
This paper studies the novel problem of adaptive energy management towards the
goal of self-sustainable wearables by using harvested energy to supplement the
battery energy and to reduce manual recharging by users. To solve this problem,
we propose a principled algorithm referred as AdaEM. There are two key ideas
behind AdaEM. First, it uses machine learning (ML) methods to learn predictive
models of user activity and energy usage patterns. These models allow us to
estimate the potential of energy harvesting in a day as a function of the user
activities. Second, it reasons about the uncertainty in predictions and
estimations from the ML models to optimize the energy management decisions
using a dynamic robust optimization (DyRO) formulation. We propose a
light-weight solution for DyRO to meet the practical needs of deployment. We
validate the AdaEM approach on a wearable device prototype consisting of solar
and motion energy harvesting using real-world data of user activities.
Experiments show that AdaEM achieves solutions that are within 5% of the
optimal with less than 0.005% execution time and energy overhead.

an input of an arbitrary size. Noise reduction allows to extract the parameters
that characterize the sample dynamics with temporal resolution limited only by

the player to learn numerous skills at once. An important factor of success is
buying the correct items which forms a complex task depending on various

(strain) in engineering materials and components. However, the gauge volume and
hence spatial resolution is limited by the beam defining apertures and can be
anisotropic for very low and high diffraction (scattering) angles.
Alternatively, wavelength resolved neutron transmission imaging has a potential
to retrieve information tomographically about residual strain induced within
materials through measurement in transmission of Bragg edges - crystallographic
fingerprints whose locations and shapes depend on microstructure and strain
distribution. In such a case the spatial resolution is determined by the
geometrical blurring of the measurement setup and the detector point spread
function. Mathematically, reconstruction of strain tensor field is described by
the longitudinal ray transform; this transform has a non-trivial null-space,
making direct inversion impossible. A combination of the longitudinal ray
transform with physical constraints was used to reconstruct strain tensor
fields in convex objects. To relax physical constraints and generalise
reconstruction, a recently introduced concept of histogram tomography can be
employed. Histogram tomography relies on our ability to resolve the
distribution of strain in the beam direction, as we discuss in the paper. More
specifically, Bragg edge strain tomography requires extraction of the second
moment (variance about zero) of the strain distribution which has not yet been
demonstrated in practice. In this paper we verify experimentally that the
second moment can be reliably measured for a previously well characterised
aluminium ring and plug sample. We compare experimental measurements against
numerical calculation and further support our conclusions by rigorous
uncertainty quantification of the estimated mean and variance of the strain
distribution.

ways: learning probabilistic embedding, and incorporating trainable and
regularized priors which utilize the rich side information of cold start users
and advertisements (Ads). The two techniques are naturally integrated into a
variational inference framework, forming an end-to-end training process.
Abundant empirical tests on benchmark datasets well demonstrate the advantages
of our proposed VELF. Besides, extended experiments confirmed that our
parameterized and regularized priors provide more generalization capability
than traditional fixed priors.

extracting salient phrases that best describe the document. This paper proposes
a novel unsupervised graph-based ranking method to extract high-quality phrases
from a given document. We obtain the contextualized embeddings from pre-trained
language models enriched with topic vectors from Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) to represent the candidate phrases and the document. We introduce a
scoring mechanism for the phrases using the information obtained from
contextualized embeddings and the topic vectors. The salient phrases are
extracted using a ranking algorithm on an undirected graph constructed for the
given document. In the undirected graph, the nodes represent the phrases, and
the edges between the phrases represent the semantic relatedness between them,
weighted by a score obtained from the scoring mechanism. To demonstrate the
efficacy of our proposed method, we perform several experiments on open source
datasets in the science domain and observe that our novel method outperforms
existing unsupervised embedding based keyphrase extraction methods. For
instance, on the SemEval2017 dataset, our method advances the F1 score from
0.2195 (EmbedRank) to 0.2819 at the top 10 extracted keyphrases. Several
variants of the proposed algorithm are investigated to determine their effect
on the quality of keyphrases. We further demonstrate the ability of our
proposed method to collect additional high-quality keyphrases that are not
present in the document from external knowledge bases like Wikipedia for
enriching the document with newly discovered keyphrases. We evaluate this step
on a collection of annotated documents. The F1-score at the top 10 expanded
keyphrases is 0.60, indicating that our algorithm can also be used for
'concept' expansion using external knowledge.

unpredictability owing to shared resources such as caches interfering. Cache
partitioning is used to alleviate the Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET)
estimation by isolating the shared cache across each thread to reduce
interference. It does, however, prohibit data from being transferred between
parallel threads running on different cores. In this paper we present (SRCP) a
cache replacement mechanism for partitioned caches that is aware of data being
shared across threads, prevents shared data from being replicated across
partitions and frequently used data from being evicted from caches. Our
technique outperforms TA-DRRIP and EHC, which are existing state-of-the-art
cache replacement algorithms, by 13.34% in cache hit-rate and 10.4% in
performance over LRU (least recently used) cache replacement policy.

Planck constant was fixed, similarly to the values of the unperturbed ground
state hyperfine transition frequency of the $^{133}$Cs atom, speed of light in
vacuum. Theoretically and differently from the past, the kilogram is now
explicitly defined as the unit of inertial mass. Experimentally, the kilogram
is realized by atom count or the Kibble balance. We show that only the former
method measures the inertial mass without assuming the universality of free
fall. Therefore, the agreement between the two measures can be interpreted as a
test of the equivalence principle.

models are based on standard Poincare invariant quantum theory (SQT). Here
irreducible representations (IRs) of the Poincare algebra are such that in each
IR, the energies are either >=0 or <=0. In the first case, IRs are associated
with particles and in the second case - with antiparticles, while particles for
which all additive quantum numbers (electric charge, baryon and lepton quantum
numbers) equal zero are called neutral. However, SQT is a special degenerate
case of finite quantum theory (FQT) in the formal limit $p\to\infty$ where p is
a characteristic of a ring in FQT. In FQT, one IR of the symmetry algebra
describes a particle and its antiparticle simultaneously, and there are no
conservation laws of additive quantum numbers. One IR in FQT splits into two
standard IRs with positive and negative energies as a result of symmetry
breaking in the formal limit $p\to\infty$ . The construction of FQT is one of
the most fundamental (if not the most fundamental) problems of particle theory.

successes, they can be difficult to augment or maintain as needs shift.
Rule-based methods, on the other hand, can be more easily modified. However,
crafting rules requires expertise in linguistics and the domain of interest,
making it infeasible for most users. Here we attempt to combine the advantages
of these two directions while mitigating their drawbacks. We adapt recent
advances from the adjacent field of program synthesis to information
extraction, synthesizing rules from provided examples. We use a
transformer-based architecture to guide an enumerative search, and show that
this reduces the number of steps that need to be explored before a rule is
found. Further, we show that without training the synthesis algorithm on the
specific domain, our synthesized rules achieve state-of-the-art performance on
the 1-shot scenario of a task that focuses on few-shot learning for relation
classification, and competitive performance in the 5-shot scenario.
