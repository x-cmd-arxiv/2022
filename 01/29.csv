($\sim$31000 km above surface), in the closest approach of this asteroid in
recorded history. This event provides unique scientific opportunities to study
the asteroid, its orbit, and surface characteristics at an exceptionally close
distance. In this paper we perform a synthetic geometrical, geographical and
temporal analysis of the conditions under which the asteroid can be observed
from Earth, with a particular emphasis on the conditions and scientific
opportunities for bistatic radar observations, the most feasible radar
technique applicable during such a close approach. For this purpose, we compile
a list of present and future radio observatories around the globe which could
participate in bistatic radar observation campaigns during the closest approach
of Apophis. We estimate signal-to-noise ratios, apparent sky rotation, surface
coverage and other observing conditions. We find that a global collaboration of
observatories across Australia, Africa, Europe and America will produce
high-resolution delay-Doppler radar images with signal-to-noise ratios above
$10^8$, while covering $\sim$85\% of the asteroid surface. Moreover, if
properly coordinated, the extreme approach of the asteroid might allow for
radio amateur detection of the signals sent by large radio observatories and
citizen science projects could then be organized. We also find that for visual
observations, the Canary Islands will offer the best observing conditions
during the closest approach, both for professionals as well as for amateurs.
The apparent size of Apophis will be 2-3 times larger than typical seeing,
allowing for resolved images of the surface.

show this we develop new robust methods, which include methods with
quantization, coordinate methods, distributed randomized local methods, and
others. Most of these approaches have never been considered in the generality
of variational inequalities and have previously been used only for minimization
problems. The robustness of the new methods is also confirmed by numerical
experiments with GANs.

source historically classified as a radio halo. Its radio power at 1.4 GHz
makes it one of the most significant outliers in the scaling relations between
observables derived from multi-wavelength observations of galaxy clusters: it
has a morphology that is different and offset from the thermal gas, and it has
polarized emission at 1.4 GHz typically difficult to observe for this class of
sources. A magnetic field fluctuating on large spatial scales (~ 1 Mpc) can
explain these peculiarities but the formation mechanism for this source is not
yet completely clear. To investigate its formation mechanism, we present new
observations obtained with the LOw Frequency ARray at 120-168 MHz and the
Jansky Very Large Array at 1-2 GHz, which allow us to study the spectral index
distribution of this source. According to our data the source is observed to be
more extended at 144 MHz than previously inferred at 1.4 GHz, with a total size
of about 1.8 Mpc and a flux density S_144MHz = (1.52 +- 0.31) Jy. The spectral
index distribution of the source is patchy with an average spectral index alpha
~ 1.2 between 144 MHz and 1.410 GHz, while an integrated spectral index alpha ~
2.1 has been obtained between 1.410 GHz and 1.782 GHz. A previously unseen
patch of steep spectrum emission is clearly detected at 144 MHz in the south of
the cluster. Overall, our findings suggest that we are observing an overlapping
of different structures, powered by the turbulence associated with the primary
and a possible secondary merger.

microlensing event search are Classical Be-type stars, Young Stellar Objects
and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars such as Miras. We build a training set using
thousands of examples for the main classes of alerting stars combining optical
to mid-infrared magnitudes from Gaia, 2MASS and AllWISE catalogues. We used
supervised machine learning techniques to build models for classification of

Science Alerts which were studied spectroscopically and photometrically. With
the use of only archival information at 90% probability threshold we correctly
identified one-third of the microlensing events. We also run our classifier on
positions of 368 Gaia alerts which were flagged as potential candidates for
microlensing events. At the 90% probability threshold we classified 38
microlensing events and 29 other types of variables. The machine learning

scientific community. Although researchers have proposed different models to
explain these peculiar objects, modified theories of Einstein's gravity,
particularly $f(R)$ gravity with $R$ being the scalar curvature, seems to be
one of the finest choices to explain both the regimes of these peculiar WDs. It
was already shown that considering higher-order corrections to the Starobinsky
model with two parameters, the structure of sub- and super-Chandrasekhar
progenitor WDs can be explained self consistently. It is also well-known that
WDs can be considered Newtonian objects because of their large size. In this
paper, we derive the weak-field limit of $f(R)$ gravity, which turns out to be
the higher-order correction to the Poisson equation. Later, we use this
equation to obtain the structures of sub- and super-Chandrasekhar limiting mass
WDs at various central densities incorporating just one model parameter.

both flexible and descriptive, and we demonstrate its utility by achieving
promising results in both shape classification and image segmentation tasks.

The cosmic time evolution of this cosmon field realizes a crossover from the
region of an ultraviolet fixed point in the infinite past to an infrared fixed
point in the infinite future. This amounts to a transition from early inflation
to late dynamical dark energy, with intermediate radiation and matter
domination. The scaling solution of the renormalization flow in quantum gravity
connects the two fixed points. It provides for the essential characteristics of
the scalar potential needed for the crossover cosmology and solves the
cosmological constant problem dynamically. The quantum scale symmetry at the
infrared fixed point protects the tiny mass of the cosmon and suppresses the
cosmon coupling to atoms without the need of a non-linear screening mechanism,
thereby explaining apparent issues of fine tuning. For a given content of
particles the scaling solution of quantum gravity is a predictive framework for
the properties of inflation and dynamical dark energy.

regimes in the dynamics of electrically-deforming liquid crystal networks [Van
der Kooij et al., Nat. Commun. 10, 1 (2019)]. Based on a Landau-theoretical
framework, which encompasses spatially resolved information, we interpret these
regimes: initially, the response is dominated by thermal noise, then the top of
the film expands, followed by a permeation of this response into the bulk. An
important signature of this interpretation is a significant dependence of the
regime time scales on film thickness, where we observe a clear
thin-film-to-bulk transition. The point of transition coincides with the
emergence of spatial inhomogeneities in the bulk, i.e., domain formation, and
should be avoided due to the less predictable steady-state expansion it gives
rise to. Finally, we show that this domain formation can be suppressed by
decreasing the initial thickness of the film, and increasing the linear
dimensions of the mesogens, or their orientational order when crosslinked into
the network, though this comes at the cost of the deformation magnitude. Our
results contribute to achieving finer control over how smart liquid crystal
network coatings are activated.

  Games with Independent Chains",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a subclass of $n$-player stochastic games, in which players have
their own internal state/action spaces while they are coupled through their
payoff functions. It is assumed that players' internal chains are driven by
independent transition probabilities. Moreover, players can receive only
realizations of their payoffs, not the actual functions, and cannot observe
each other's states/actions. For this class of games, we first show that
finding a stationary Nash equilibrium (NE) policy without any assumption on the
reward functions is interactable. However, for general reward functions, we
develop polynomial-time learning algorithms based on dual averaging and dual
mirror descent, which converge in terms of the averaged Nikaido-Isoda distance
to the set of $\epsilon$-NE policies almost surely or in expectation. In
particular, under extra assumptions on the reward functions such as social
concavity, we derive polynomial upper bounds on the number of iterates to
achieve an $\epsilon$-NE policy with high probability. Finally, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in learning $\epsilon$-NE policies
using numerical experiments for energy management in smart grids.

consistency, quantifying the speed at which the posterior distribution
concentrates on arbitrarily small neighborhoods of the true model, with
probability tending to 1 or almost surely, as the sample size goes to infinity.
Under the Bayesian nonparametric framework, a common assumption in the study of
PCRs is that the model is dominated for the observations; that is, it is
assumed that the posterior can be written through the Bayes formula. In this
paper, we consider the problem of establishing PCRs in Bayesian nonparametric
models where the posterior distribution is not available through the Bayes
formula, and hence models that are non-dominated for the observations. By means
of the Wasserstein distance and a suitable sieve construction, our main result
establishes PCRs in Bayesian nonparametric models where the posterior is
available through a more general disintegration than the Bayes formula. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first general approach to provide PCRs in
non-dominated Bayesian nonparametric models, and it relies on minimal modeling
assumptions and on a suitable continuity assumption for the posterior
distribution. Some refinements of our result are presented under additional
assumptions on the prior distribution, and applications are given with respect
to the Dirichlet process prior and the normalized extended Gamma process prior.

Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that relies on noisy policies for exploration is

in cluttered environments, containing many obstacles and narrow passageways.
Designing dense effective rewards is challenging, resulting in exploration
issues during training. Such a problem becomes even more serious when tasks are
described using temporal logic specifications. This work presents a deep policy
gradient algorithm for controlling a robot with unknown dynamics operating in a
cluttered environment when the task is specified as a Linear Temporal Logic

types automatically to get static guarantees without writing types. Existing
inference techniques rely mostly on static typing tools such as PyType for
direct type inference; more recently, neural type inference has been proposed.
However, neural type inference is data hungry, and depends on collecting
labeled data based on static typing. Such tools, however, are poor at inferring

continuous measures via a generative model. Previous approaches rely on
regularization (entropic/quadratic) which introduces bias or on input convex
neural networks which are not expressive enough for large-scale tasks. In
contrast, our algorithm does not introduce bias and allows using arbitrary

construct Ave, celeba! dataset which can be used for quantitative evaluation of
barycenter algorithms by using standard metrics of generative models such as

for the fifth generation (5G) networks and beyond. It enables direct
communication between mobile users and thereby extends coverage for devices
lacking direct access to the cellular infrastructure and hence enhances network
capacity. D2D networks are complex, highly dynamic and will be strongly
augmented by intelligence for decision making at both the edge and core of the
network, which makes them particularly difficult to predict and analyze.
Conventionally, D2D systems are evaluated, investigated and analyzed using
analytical and probabilistic models (e.g., from stochastic geometry). However,
applying classical simulation and analytical tools to such a complex system is
often hard to track and inaccurate. In this paper, we present a modeling and
simulation framework from the perspective of complex-systems science and
exhibit an agent-based model for the simulation of D2D coverage extensions. We
also present a theoretical study to benchmark our proposed approach for a basic
scenario that is less complicated to model mathematically. Our simulation
results show that we are indeed able to predict coverage extensions for
multi-hop scenarios and quantify the effects of street-system characteristics
and pedestrian mobility on the connection time of devices to the base station
(BS). To our knowledge, this is the first study that applies agent-based
simulations for coverage extensions in D2D.

typically require approximations to be computationally tractable. The most
successful family of approximations are Kronecker-Factored, block-diagonal
curvature estimates (KFAC). Here, we combine tools from prior work to evaluate
exact second-order updates with careful ablations to establish a surprising
result: Due to its approximations, KFAC is not closely related to second-order
updates, and in particular, it significantly outperforms true second-order
updates. This challenges widely held believes and immediately raises the
question why KFAC performs so well. Towards answering this question we present
evidence strongly suggesting that KFAC approximates a first-order algorithm,
which performs gradient descent on neurons rather than weights. Finally, we
show that this optimizer often improves over KFAC in terms of computational
cost and data-efficiency.

search for merger situations based on its mass accretion history, defining
mergers as very rapid increases in the halo mass. Based upon the evolution of
the dynamical state of the cluster we define a pre- and post-merger phase. We
create a list of all these events and statistically study their mass ratio and
timescales, with the former verifying that all instances are in fact major
mergers. By comparing to a control sample of clusters without mergers, we study
the effect mergers have on the stellar component of the BCG. Analysing the
mass, age and metallicity of the BCG stellar particles, we find that the
stellar content of BCGs grows significantly during mergers and, even though the
main growth mechanism is the accretion of older stars, there is even a burst in
star formation induced by the merger. In our simulations, BCGs in mergers form
in median around 70 per cent more stars than those normally growing, although
this depends on the radius considered for defining the BCG. Regarding
observable properties, we see an increase in SDSS-u luminosity of 20 per cent
during mergers, accompanied by a slightly slower increase of the galaxy g-r
colour as compared to the control sample.

to measure the stiffness of biological tissues. While OCE has been applied to
relatively homogeneous samples, tissues with significantly varying elasticity
through depth pose a challenge, requiring depth-resolved measurement with
sufficient resolution and accuracy. Here, we develop a broadband Rayleigh-wave
OCE technique capable of measuring the elastic moduli of the 3 major skin
layers (epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis) reliably by analyzing the dispersion
of leaky Rayleigh surface waves over a wide frequency range of 0.1-10 kHz. We
show that a previously unexplored, high frequency range of 4-10 kHz is critical
to resolve the thin epidermis, while a low frequency range of 0.2-1 kHz is
adequate to probe the dermis and deeper hypodermis. We develop a dual
bilayer-based inverse model to determine the elastic moduli in all 3 layers and
verify its high accuracy with finite element analysis and skin-mimicking
phantoms. Finally, the technique is applied to measure the forearm skin of
healthy volunteers. The Young's modulus of the epidermis (including the stratum
corneum) is measured to be ~ 4 MPa at 4-10 kHz, whereas Young's moduli of the
dermis and hypodermis are about 40 and 15 kPa, respectively, at 0.2-1 kHz.
Besides dermatologic applications, this method may be useful for the mechanical
analysis of various other layered tissues with sub-mm depth resolution.

ingredients, allow one to study the impact of a given physics on a broad range
of initial conditions and are a key ingredient for modeling the evolution of
galaxies. Aims: We present a grid of single star models for masses between 0.8
and 120 $M_\odot$, with and without rotation for a mass fraction of heavy
element Z=0.006, representative of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Methods:
We used the Geneva stellar evolution code. The evolution was computed until the
end of the central carbon-burning phase, the early asymptotic giant branch
phase, or the core helium-flash for massive, intermediate, and low mass stars,
respectively. Results: The outputs of the present stellar models are well
framed by the outputs of the two grids obtained by our group for metallicities
above and below the one considered here. The models of the present work provide
a good fit to the nitrogen surface enrichments observed during the main
sequence for stars in the LMC with initial masses around 15 $M_\odot$. They
also reproduce the slope of the luminosity function of red supergiants of the
LMC well, which is a feature that is sensitive to the time-averaged mass loss
rate over the red supergiant phase. The most massive black hole that can be
formed from the present models at Z=0.006 is around 55 $M_\odot$. No model in
the range of mass considered will enter into the pair-instability supernova
regime, while the minimal mass to enter the region of pair pulsation
instability is around 60 $M_\odot$ for the rotating models and 85 $M_\odot$ for
the nonrotating ones. Conclusions: The present models are of particular
interest for comparisons with observations in the LMC and also in the outer
regions of the Milky Way. We provide public access to numerical tables that can
be used for computing interpolated tracks and for population synthesis studies.

the Hamming distance between any two states separated by $k$ steps in a perfect

  Poincare, Probabilites et Statistiques",,,,"math.CO math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We introduce a class of random graph processes, which we call \emph{flip
processes}. Each such process is given by a \emph{rule} which is a function
$\mathcal{R}:\mathcal{H}_k\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_k$ from all labelled
$k$-vertex graphs into itself ($k$ is fixed). The process starts with a given
$n$-vertex graph $G_0$. In each step, the graph $G_i$ is obtained by sampling
$k$ random vertices $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ of $G_{i-1}$ and replacing the induced
graph $F:=G_{i-1}[v_1,\ldots,v_k]$ by $\mathcal{R}(F)$. This class contains
several previously studied processes including the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random
graph process and the triangle removal process. Actually, our definition of
flip processes is more general, in that $\mathcal{R}(F)$ is a probability
distribution on $\mathcal{H}_k$, thus allowing randomised replacements.
  Given a flip process with a rule $\mathcal{R}$, we construct time-indexed
trajectories $\Phi:\mathcal{W}_0\times [0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathcal{W}_0$ in
the space of graphons. We prove that for any $T > 0$ starting with a large
finite graph $G_0$ which is close to a graphon $W_0$ in the cut norm, with high
probability the flip process will stay in a thin sausage around the trajectory
$(\Phi(W_0,t))_{t=0}^T$ (after rescaling the time by the square of the order of
the graph).
  These graphon trajectories are then studied from the perspective of dynamical
systems. Among others topics, we study continuity properties of these
trajectories with respect to time and initial graphon, existence and stability
of fixed points and speed of convergence (whenever the infinite time limit
exists). We give an example of a flip process with a periodic trajectory.

market value unlocked by AI over the next decade (up to 6 trillion USD per
year) will be in marketing&sales. In particular, AI will enable the
optimization of more and more intricate economic settings, in which multiple
different activities need to be jointly automated. This is the case of, e.g.,
Google Hotel Ads and Tripadvisor, where auctions are used to display ads of
similar products or services together with their prices. As in classical ad
auctions, the ads are ranked depending on the advertisers' bids, whereas,
differently from classical settings, ads are displayed together with their
prices, so as to provide a direct comparison among them. This dramatically
affects users' behavior, as well as the properties of ad auctions. We show
that, in such settings, social welfare maximization can be achieved by means of
a direct-revelation mechanism that jointly optimizes, in polynomial time, the
ads allocation and the advertisers' prices to be displayed with them. However,
in practice it is unlikely that advertisers allow the mechanism to choose
prices on their behalf. Indeed, in commonly-adopted mechanisms, ads allocation
and price optimization are decoupled, so that the advertisers optimize prices
and bids, while the mechanism does so for the allocation, once prices and bids
are given. We investigate how this decoupling affects the efficiency of
mechanisms. In particular, we study the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of
Stability (PoS) of indirect-revelation mechanisms with both VCG and GSP
payments, showing that the PoS for the revenue may be unbounded even with two
slots, and the PoA for the social welfare may be as large as the number of
slots. Nevertheless, we show that, under some assumptions, simple modifications
to the indirect-revelation mechanism with VCG payments achieve a PoS of 1 for

frames from low-quality frames. Different from single image restoration, video
restoration generally requires to utilize temporal information from multiple
adjacent but usually misaligned video frames. Existing deep methods generally
tackle with this by exploiting a sliding window strategy or a recurrent
architecture, which either is restricted by frame-by-frame restoration or lacks
long-range modelling ability. In this paper, we propose a Video Restoration
Transformer (VRT) with parallel frame prediction and long-range temporal
dependency modelling abilities. More specifically, VRT is composed of multiple
scales, each of which consists of two kinds of modules: temporal mutual self
attention (TMSA) and parallel warping. TMSA divides the video into small clips,
on which mutual attention is applied for joint motion estimation, feature
alignment and feature fusion, while self attention is used for feature
extraction. To enable cross-clip interactions, the video sequence is shifted
for every other layer. Besides, parallel warping is used to further fuse
information from neighboring frames by parallel feature warping. Experimental
results on five tasks, including video super-resolution, video deblurring,
video denoising, video frame interpolation and space-time video
super-resolution, demonstrate that VRT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
by large margins ($\textbf{up to 2.16dB}$) on fourteen benchmark datasets.

leads to optimal oracle complexity, but also allows to obtain iteration

decades. Our work summarizes the different approaches found in the literature,
connecting them and filling the gaps in the sometimes non-rigorous derivations.
In particular we focus on the use of local orbital basis sets where the
velocity operator cannot be approximated by the $k$-derivative of the Bloch
Hamiltonian matrix. Among other things, we show how the correct expression can
be found without unequivocal mathematical steps, how the Berry connection makes
its way in this expression, and how to properly deal with the two popular gauge
choices that coexist in the literature. Finally, we explore its use in density
functional theory calculations by comparing with its real-space evaluation
through the identification with the canonical momentum operator. This
comparison offers us, in addition, a glimpse of the importance of non-local

distributional shift where the training and the test distributions are
different. A suite of approaches, such as importance weighting, and variants of
distributionally robust optimization (DRO), have been proposed to solve this
problem. But a line of recent work has empirically shown that these approaches
do not significantly improve over ERM in real applications with distribution
shift. The goal of this work is to obtain a comprehensive theoretical
understanding of this intriguing phenomenon. We first posit the class of
Generalized Reweighting (GRW) algorithms, as a broad category of approaches
that iteratively update model parameters based on iterative reweighting of the
training samples. We show that when overparameterized models are trained under
GRW, the resulting models are close to that obtained by ERM. We also show that
adding small regularization which does not greatly affect the empirical
training accuracy does not help. Together, our results show that a broad
category of what we term GRW approaches are not able to achieve
distributionally robust generalization. Our work thus has the following
sobering takeaway: to make progress towards distributionally robust
generalization, we either have to develop non-GRW approaches, or perhaps devise
novel classification/regression loss functions that are adapted to the class of
GRW approaches.

agree with the outcome on at least as many topics as they disagree on. Our
results can also be seen as quantifying Anscombes paradox which states that
topic-wise majority outcome may not be supported by a majority. To measure the
representativeness of an outcome, we consider two metrics. First, we look for
an outcome that agrees with a majority on as many topics as possible. We prove
that the maximum number such that there is guaranteed to exist an outcome that
agrees with a majority on this number of topics and has majority support,
equals $\ceil{(t+1)/2}$ where $t$ is the total number of topics. Second, we
count the number of times a voter opinion on a topic matches the outcome on

largest number of matches. We consider the ratio between this number and the
number of matches of the overall best outcome which may not have majority
support. We try to find the maximum ratio such that an outcome with majority
support and this ratio of matches compared to the overall best is guaranteed to

we consider certain topological notions of cycles in pure simplicial complexes
(uniform hypergraphs). We show that if $G$ is a $2$-dimensional pure simplicial
complex ($3$-graph) with $n$ $1$-dimensional and at least $n^{1+\alpha}$
2-dimensional faces, then $G$ contains a triangulation of the cylinder and the
M\""obius strip with $O(\frac{1}{\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\alpha})$ vertices. We
present generalizations of this for higher dimensional pure simplicial
complexes as well.
  In order to prove these results, we consider certain (properly edge colored)
graphs and hypergraphs $G$ with strong expansion. We argue that if one randomly
samples the vertices (and colors) of $G$ with not too small probability, then
many pairs of vertices are connected by a short path whose vertices (and
colors) are from the sampled set, with high probability.

  Implementation and Availability: In this work, we propose the first
domain-specific Robustness Evaluation and Enhancement Toolbox (REET) for
computational pathology applications. It provides a suite of algorithmic
strategies for enabling robustness assessment of predictive models with respect
to specialized image transformations such as staining, compression, focusing,
blurring, changes in spatial resolution, brightness variations, geometric
changes as well as pixel-level adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, REET
also enables efficient and robust training of deep learning pipelines in

the orbital history of Saturn's moons usually assume that their past dynamics
was also dominated solely by two-body resonances. Using direct numerical
integrations, we find that three-body resonances among Saturnian satellites
were quite common in the past, and could result in a relatively long-term, but
finite capture time (10 Myr or longer). We find that these three-body
resonances are invariably of the eccentricity type, and do not appear to affect
the moons' inclinations. While some three-body resonances are located close to
two-body resonances (but involve the orbital precession of the third body),
others are isolated, with no two-body arguments being near resonance. We
conclude that future studies of the system's past must take full account of
three-body resonances, which have been overlooked in the past work.

from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA),
essentially all (at least 20 of 21) of the jets are made by minifilament
eruptions, consistent with other recent studies. Here, we examine the detailed
nature of the erupting minifilaments (EMFs) in the jet bases. Wide-spire
(""blowout"") jets often have ejective EMFs, but sometimes they instead have an
EMF that is mostly confined to the jet's base rather than ejected. We also
demonstrate that narrow-spire (""standard"") jets can have either a confined EMF,
or a partially confined EMF where some of the cool minifilament leaks into the
jet's spire. Regarding EMF visibility: we find that in some cases the
minifilament is apparent in as few as one of the four EUV channels we examined,
being essentially invisible in the other channels; thus it is necessary to
examine images from multiple EUV channels before concluding that a jet does not
have an EMF at its base. The size of the EMFs, measured projected against the
sky and early in their eruption, is 14'' +- 7'', which is within a factor of
two of other measured sizes of coronal-jet EMFs.

promising means of incorporating entropy-generating effects (viscosity, heat
conduction) into relativistic fluid models, appearing as a possible alternative
to the so-called M\""uller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory successfully used to
model quark-gluon plasma. The major difference between the two lies in the
structure of the system of PDEs: BDNK theory only has a set of conservation
laws, whereas MIS also includes a set of evolution equations for its
dissipative degrees of freedom. The simpler structure of the BDNK PDEs in this
respect allows for rigorous proofs of stability, causality, and hyperbolicity
in full generality which have as yet been impossible for MIS. To capitalize on
these advantages, we present the first fully conservative multi-dimensional

reconstruction, and a central-upwind numerical flux, and is designed to
smoothly transition to a high-resolution shock-capturing perfect fluid solver

operations by classical measurements can result in disturbances and high
resource demands. To overcome these limitations, we propose protocols that
harness dissipation to realize the nonunitary evolution required for
irreversible gate operations. Using additional excited states subject to decay,
we engineer effective decay processes that perform the desired gate operations
on the smallest stable Hilbert space. These operate deterministically and in an
autonomous fashion, without the need for measurements. We exemplify our
approach considering several classical logic operations, such as the OR, NOR,
and XOR gates. Towards experimental realization, we discuss a possible
implementation in quantum dots. Our study shows that irreversible logic
operations can be efficiently performed on realistic quantum systems and that
dissipation engineering is an essential tool for obtaining nonunitary
evolutions. The proposed operations expand the quantum engineers' toolbox and
have promising applications in NISQ algorithms and quantum machine learning.

logarithmic Regge trajectories and an accumulation point in the spectrum, which
interpolates between string theory and field theory. With string theory, it is
the only other solution to duality constraints explicitly known and it
constitutes an important data point in the modern S-matrix bootstrap. Yet, its
basics properties are essentially unknown. In this paper we fill this gap and
derive the conditions of positivity and the low energy expansion of the
amplitude. On the positivity side, we discover that the amplitude switches from
a regime where it is positive in all dimensions to a regime with critical
dimensions, that connects to the known $d = 26, 10$ when the deformation is
removed. En passant, we find that the Veneziano amplitudes can be extended to
massive scalars of masses up to $m^2 = 1/3$, where it has critical dimension
6.3. On the low-energy side, we compute the first few coupligs of the theory in
terms of $q$-deformed analogues of the standard Riemann zeta values of the
string expansion. We locate their location in the EFT-hedron, and find
agreement with a recent conjecture that theories with accumulation points
populate this space. We also discuss their relation to low spin dominance.

continuous action spaces. Typically, one assumes the score function associated
with a policy is bounded, which fails to hold even for Gaussian policies. To
properly address this issue, one must introduce an exploration tolerance
parameter to quantify the region in which it is bounded. Doing so incurs a
persistent bias that appears in the attenuation rate of the expected policy
gradient norm, which is inversely proportional to the radius of the action
space. To mitigate this hidden bias, heavy-tailed policy parameterizations may
be used, which exhibit a bounded score function, but doing so can cause
instability in algorithmic updates. To address these issues, in this work, we
study the convergence of policy gradient algorithms under heavy-tailed
parameterizations, which we propose to stabilize with a combination of mirror
ascent-type updates and gradient tracking. Our main theoretical contribution is
the establishment that this scheme converges with constant step and batch
sizes, whereas prior works require these parameters to respectively shrink to
null or grow to infinity. Experimentally, this scheme under a heavy-tailed
policy parameterization yields improved reward accumulation across a variety of
settings as compared with standard benchmarks.

accretion model with a complex intrinsic absorber. Lack of strong modulation in
folded lightcurve above 3 keV reveals that emission from corresponding zone of
post-shock region (PSR) remains in view throughout the spin phase. The
broadband spectrum is modelled with a three-component absorbed plasma emission
model and absorbed isobaric cooling flow model, both of which fit the data well
with similar statistical significance. Presence of partial covering absorber is
evident in the spectra with equivalent column density
$\sim7\times10^{22}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$ and a covering fraction of $\sim 25\%$.
Strong ionised oxygen K$_{\alpha}$ line emission is detected in the spectra. We
notice spectral variability during spin phase 0.75-1.05, when there is a
considerable increase in column density of overall absorber (from $\sim 1

dwarf mass of $\sim 0.87^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\;M_{\odot}$. The iron K$_{\alpha}$
line complex shows a strong He-like and a weak neutral fluorescence line. We

cluster winds. By combining individual star clusters, we estimate the soft
X-ray emission expected from the typically unresolved diffuse hot gas in
starburst galaxies, devoid of competing emission from e.g., AGN or other
unresolved point sources. We use stellar models of sub-solar metallicities
(0.02 $Z_{\odot}$ and 0.4 $Z_{\odot}$), and take into account supernova
explosions for massive stars. For lower metallicities, we find that stellar
winds do not contribute significantly ($\lesssim 3$ % of the mechanical energy)
to the observed soft X-ray emission of normal star forming galaxies. For higher
metallicities and possibly also for larger proportions of massive star clusters
in the simulated starburst galaxies, we reproduce well the observed correlation
between star formation rate and X-ray luminosity previously reported in the
literature. However, we find that no combination of model assumptions is
capable of reproducing the substantial soft X-ray emission observed from Green
Pea galaxies, indicating that other emission mechanisms (i.e. unusually large
quantities of High-/Low-Mass X-ray Binaries, Ultra-Luminous X-ray sources, a

electro-mechanical function of the heart, yet they are difficult to determine
in-vivo, and hence rarely truly patient-specific in existing cardiac models.
FiberNet learns the fiber arrangement by solving an inverse problem with
physics-informed neural networks. The inverse problem amounts to identifying
the conduction velocity tensor of a cardiac propagation model from a set of
sparse activation maps. The use of multiple maps enables the simultaneous
identification of all the components of the conduction velocity tensor,
including the local fiber angle. We extensively test FiberNet on synthetic 2-D

that 3 maps are sufficient to accurately capture the fibers, also in the
presence of noise. With fewer maps, the role of regularization becomes
prominent. Moreover, we show that the fitted model can robustly reproduce
unseen activation maps. We envision that FiberNet will help the creation of

afterglows using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). Our search yielded seven
optical transients that resemble on-axis LGRB afterglows in terms of their red
colors ($g-r>0$ mag), faint host galaxy ($r>23$ mag), and rapid fading
($dr/dt>1$ mag/day). Spectroscopy of the transient emission within a few days
of discovery established cosmological distances ($z=0.876$ to $z=2.9$) for six
events, tripling the number of afterglows with redshift measurements discovered
by optical surveys without a $\gamma$-ray trigger. Upon a retrospective search,

ZTF21aakruew/AT2021cwd, ZTF21abfmpwn/AT2021qbd) turned out to have a likely

the simplest explanation for the apparently ""orphan"" events is that they were
regular LGRBs missed by high-energy satellites due to detector sensitivity and
duty cycle, although it is possible that they were intrinsically faint in
$\gamma$-rays or viewed slightly off-axis. We rule out a scenario in which
dirty fireballs have a similar energy per solid angle to LGRBs and are an order
of magnitude more common. In addition, we set the first direct constraint on
the ratio of the opening angles of the material producing $\gamma$-rays and the

collisions, all of which may be accompanied by bright electromagnetic
transients. In this study, we perform a wide range of hydrodynamic simulations
of close encounters between black holes and main-sequence stars that
collectively cover the parameter space of interest, and we identify and
classify the various possible outcomes. In the case of nearly head-on
collisions, the star is completely disrupted with roughly half of the stellar
material becoming bound to the black hole. For more distant encounters near the
classical tidal-disruption radius, the star is only partially disrupted on the
first pericenter passage. Depending upon the interaction details, the partially
disrupted stellar remnant may be tidally captured by the black hole or become
unbound (in some cases, receiving a sufficiently large impulsive kick from
asymmetric mass loss to be ejected from its host cluster). In the former case,
the star will undergo additional pericenter passages before ultimately being
disrupted fully. Based on the properties of the material bound to the black
hole at the end of our simulations (in particular, the total bound mass and
angular momentum), we comment upon the expected accretion process and
associated electromagnetic signatures that are likely to result.

(labelled 'Elemental' and 'Species'), based on recent approaches, incorporated
into the GIZMO code and coupled with FIRE-2 stellar feedback and ISM physics.
Both models account for turbulent dust diffusion, stellar production of dust,
dust growth via gas-dust accretion, and dust destruction from time-resolved
supernovae, thermal sputtering in hot gas, and astration. The ""Elemental"" model
tracks the evolution of generalized dust species and utilizes a simple,
'tunable' dust growth routine, while the ""Species"" model tracks the evolution
of specific dust species with set chemical compositions and incorporates a
physically motivated, two-phase dust growth routine. We test and compare these
models in an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and find that while both produce
reasonable galaxy-integrated dust-to-metals (D/Z) ratios and predict gas-dust
accretion as the main dust growth mechanism, a chemically motivated model is
needed to reproduce the observed scaling relation between individual element
depletions and D/Z with column density and local gas density. We also find the
inclusion of theoretical metallic iron and O-bearing dust species are needed in
the case of specific dust species in order to match observations of O and Fe
depletions, and the integration of a sub-resolution dense molecular gas/CO
scheme is needed to both match observed C depletions and ensure carbonaceous
dust is not overproduced in dense environments.

Hitomi in observations of the Perseus cluster, measurements of gas velocities
in clusters from high-resolution X-ray spectra will be achievable with upcoming
X-ray calorimeters like those on board XRISM, Athena, or a Lynx like mission.
We investigate this possibility for interesting locations across a major
cluster merger from a hydrodynamical simulation, via X-ray synthetic spectra
with a few eV energy resolution. We observe the system from directions
perpendicular to the plane of the merger and along the merger axis. In these
extreme geometrical configurations, we find clear non-Gaussian shapes of the
iron He-like K_alpha line at 6.7keV. The velocity dispersion predicted from the
simulations can be retrieved for the brightest 100ks pointings with XRISM
Resolve, despite some discrepancy related to the complex non-Gaussian line
shapes. Measurements in faint regions require however high S/N and the larger
collecting area of the Athena X-IFU calorimeter is thus needed. With the
latter, we also investigate the gas temperature and velocity gradient across
the merger bow shock edge, from 20""-wide annuli extracted from a single 1Ms
X-IFU pointing. We find best-fit temperature and velocity dispersion values
that are consistent with predictions from the simulations within 1-sigma, but
the uncertainties on the inferred velocity dispersion are too large to place
any stringent constraints on the shallow gradient downstream of the shock. We
also present simulated images of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich

scheme creates a DFS in the presence of collective decoherence. We therefore
have the ability to engineer states that have high multi-particle entanglements

demonstrate a more optimized driving scheme that utilizes the knowledge of
possible diabatic evolution gained from the so-called adiabatic criteria. This
allows us to evolve to a desired state with exceptionally high fidelity on a

structure-aware value from the cooperative game theory proposed by Hamiache and
Navarro (HN). When used to score node importance, the HN value utilizes graph
structures to attribute cooperation surplus between neighbor nodes, resembling
message passing in GNNs, so that node importance scores reflect not only the
node feature importance, but also the node structural roles. We demonstrate
that GStarX produces qualitatively more intuitive explanations, and
quantitatively improves explanation fidelity over strong baselines on chemical

employed as an important tool to evaluate the optimality of human eye

spatial 1/f noise. The corresponding template responses follow Gaussian
distributions and the optimal search strategy can be analytically determined.
However, the computation of the IS can be intractable when considering more
realistic and complex backgrounds such as medical images. Modern reinforcement
learning methods, successfully applied to obtain optimal policy for a variety
of tasks, do not require complete knowledge of the background generating
functions and can be potentially applied to anatomical backgrounds. An
important first step is to validate the optimality of the reinforcement

that the search strategy corresponding to the Q-network is consistent with the

energy curves for the external degree of freedom of quantum particles. We
investigate nonadiabatic decay of metastable states on such avoided crossings
(MSACs) using diabatic and adiabatic representations. The system is described
by a single scaled adiabaticity parameter, $V$. The time-independent
two-component Schr\""odinger equation is solved in both representations, and the
nonadiabatic lifetimes of MSACs are determined from a wave-function flux
calculation and from the Breit-Wigner formula, leading to four lifetime values
for each MSAC. We also solve the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation in both
pictures and derive the MSAC lifetimes from wave-function decay. The sets of
six non-perturbative values for the MSAC lifetimes agree well, validating the
approaches. As the adiabaticity parameter $V$ is increased by about a factor of
ten, the MSAC character transitions from marginally to highly stable, with the
lifetimes increasing by about ten orders of magnitude. The $\nu$-dependence of
the lifetimes in several regimes is discussed. Time-dependent perturbation
theory is found to yield approximate lifetimes that deviate by $\lesssim 30\%$
from the non-perturbative results, while predictions based on the
semi-classical Landau-Zener tunneling equation are found to be up to a factor
of twenty off, over the ranges of $V$ and $\nu$ studied. The results are
relevant to numerous atomic and molecular systems with quantum states on
intersecting, coupled potential energy curves.

finite element (FE) method facilitates the use of nonlocal vector calculus to
prove well-posedeness, convergence, and stability of such schemes. Employing an
FE method also facilitates meshing of complicated domain geometries and
coupling with FE methods for local problems. However, nonlocal weak problems
involve the computation of a double-integral, which is computationally
expensive and presents several challenges. In particular, the inner integral of
the variational form associated with the stiffness matrix is defined over the
intersections of FE mesh elements with a ball of radius $\delta$, where
$\delta$ is the range of nonlocal interaction. Identifying and parameterizing
these intersections is a nontrivial computational geometry problem. In this
work, we propose a quadrature technique where the inner integration is
performed using quadrature points distributed over the full ball, without
regard for how it intersects elements, and weights are computed based on the
generalized moving least squares method. Thus, as opposed to all previously
employed methods, our technique does not require element-by-element integration
and fully circumvents the computation of element-ball intersections. This paper
considers one- and two-dimensional implementations of piecewise linear
continuous FE approximations, focusing on the case where the element size h and
the nonlocal radius $\delta$ are proportional, as is typical of practical
computations. When boundary conditions are treated carefully and the outer
integral of the variational form is computed accurately, the proposed method is
asymptotically compatible in the limit of $h \sim \delta \to 0$, featuring at
least first-order convergence in L^2 for all dimensions, using both uniform and
nonuniform grids.

of all possible molecules in a given biological or environmental sample can be
vast and largely unexplored, mainly due to current limitations in processing of
'big data' by brute force methods (e.g., enumeration of all possible compounds

multiple new cheminformatics tools that incorporate AI techniques to
characterize and learn the structure and properties of molecules in order to
generate plausible compounds, thereby contributing to more accessible and
explorable regions of chemical space without the need for brute force methods.
We have used one such tool, a deep-learning software called DarkChem, which
learns a representation of the molecular structure of compounds by compressing
them into a latent space. With DarkChem's design, distance in this latent space
is often associated with compound similarity, making sparse regions interesting
targets for compound generation due to the possibility of generating novel

the state-of-the art approaches, but fully training a deep learning model is
not always feasible in materials informatics due to limitations on data

critical need in the application of deep learning to materials informatics
problems to develop efficient transfer learning algorithms. The Bayesian
framework is natural for transfer learning because the model trained from the
source data can be encoded in the prior distribution for the target task of

unaccounted for in the literature, and is complicated for deep learning because
the parameter space is large and the interpretations of individual parameters

from labor-intensive production to capital/technology-intensive production
along with offshoring may improve the US company's ESG performance. Moreover,
US companies have incentives to actively pursue more ESG engagement to
differentiate from Chinese imports. Exploiting a trade policy in which US
congress granted China the Permanent Normal Trade Relations and the resulting
change in expected tariff rates on Chinese imports, we find that greater import
competition from China leads to an increase in the US company's ESG
performance. The improvement primarily stems from ""doing more positives"" and
from more involvement on environmental initiatives. Indirect and direct

states that can generate correlated electron behavior when the Fermi level lies
within them. In the kagome metal CoSn, this alignment is not realized, and the
compound is a Pauli paramagnet. Here we show that replacing part of the tin
with indium (CoSn1-xInx) moves the Fermi energy into the flat band region, with
support from band structure calculations, heat capacity measurements, and angle
resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The associated instability results in the
emergence of itinerant antiferromagnetism with a Neel temperature up to 30K.
Long range magnetic order is confirmed by neutron diffraction measurements,
which indicate an ordered magnetic moment of 0.1-0.2 Bohr magnetons per Co (for
x = 0.4). Thus, CoSn1-xInx provides a rare example of an itinerant
antiferromagnet with a small ordered moment. This work provides clear evidence
that flat bands arising from frustrated lattices in bulk crystals represent a
viable route to new physics, evidenced here by the emergence of magnetic order
upon introducing a non-magnetic dopant into a non-magnetic kagome metal.

In general, a small initial population size is harmful to the survival of a
species since when the initial data is below the Allee threshold the population
tends to extinction, rather than persistence. Another interesting feature of
population evolution is that a species whose movement strategy follows a
conditional dispersal strategy is more likely to persist. In other words, the
biased movement can be a benefit for the persistence of the population. The
coexistence of the above two conflicting mechanisms makes the dynamics rather
intricate. However, some numerical results obtained by Cosner et. al. (SIAM J.
Appl. Math., Vol. 81, No. 2, 2021) show that the directed movement can
invalidate the strong Allee effect and help the population survive. To study
this intriguing phenomenon, we consider the pattern formation and local

recently gained prominence for a wide variety of tasks such as novel view
synthesis and 3D object representation and rendering. However, a significant
challenge with these representations is that both training and inference with
an MLP over a large number of input coordinates to learn and represent an
image, video, or 3D object, require large amounts of computation and incur long
processing times. In this work, we aim to accelerate inference and training of
coordinate-based MLPs for implicit neural representations by proposing a new
split MLP architecture, CoordX. With CoordX, the initial layers are split to
learn each dimension of the input coordinates separately. The intermediate
features are then fused by the last layers to generate the learned signal at
the corresponding coordinate point. This significantly reduces the amount of
computation required and leads to large speedups in training and inference,
while achieving similar accuracy as the baseline MLP. This approach thus aims
at first learning functions that are a decomposition of the original signal and
then fusing them to generate the learned signal. Our proposed architecture can
be generally used for many implicit neural representation tasks with no
additional memory overheads. We demonstrate a speedup of up to 2.92x compared
to the baseline model for image, video, and 3D shape representation and

agent has to learn, via exploration, which states and actions are safe. A
popular approach in this line of research is to combine a model-free RL
algorithm with the Lagrangian method to adjust the weight of the constraint
reward relative to the utility reward dynamically. It relies on a single policy
to handle the conflict between utility and constraint rewards, which is often
challenging. We present SEditor, a two-policy approach that learns a safety
editor policy transforming potentially unsafe actions proposed by a utility
maximizer policy into safe ones. The safety editor is trained to maximize the
constraint reward while minimizing a hinge loss of the utility state-action
values before and after an action is edited. SEditor extends existing safety
layer designs that assume simplified safety models, to general safe RL
scenarios where the safety model can in theory be arbitrarily complex. As a
first-order method, it is easy to implement and efficient for both inference
and training. On 12 Safety Gym tasks and 2 safe racing tasks, SEditor obtains
much a higher overall safety-weighted-utility (SWU) score than the baselines,

some tasks, this low violation rate is up to 200 times lower than that of an

models to new domains. Thus, the results posit combinatorial coverage as a
holistic approach to training and testing for machine learning. In contrast to
prior work which has focused on the use of coverage in regard to the internal
of neural networks, this paper considers coverage over simple features derived
from inputs and outputs. Thus, this paper addresses the case where the supplier
of test and training sets for machine learning models does not have
intellectual property rights to the models themselves. Finally, the paper
addresses prior criticism of combinatorial coverage and provides a rebuttal
which advocates the use of coverage metrics in machine learning applications.

when data is in the form of continuous and repeated measurements of subjects
from a population of interest, while temporal profiles of subjects commonly
follow a nonlinear tendency. While frequentist analysis of nonlinear mixed
effects models has a long history, Bayesian analysis of the models has received
comparatively little attention until the late 1980s due primarily to the
time-consuming nature of Bayesian computation. Since the early 1990s Bayesian
approaches for the models began to emerge to leverage rapid developments in
computing power, and recently, have received significant attention due to (1)
superiority to quantify the uncertainty of parameter estimation; (2) utility to
incorporate prior knowledge into the models; and (3) flexibility to match
exactly the increasing complexity of scientific research arising from diverse
industrial and academic fields. This review article presents an overview of
modeling strategies to implement Bayesian approaches for the nonlinear mixed
effects models, ranging from designing a scientific question out of real-life
problems to practical computations.

have recently grown in popularity, due to the size of these graphs as well as
regulations on keeping data where it is generated. However, a single connected
graph cannot be disjointly partitioned onto multiple clients due to the
cross-client edges connecting graph nodes. Thus, distributed methods for
training a model on a single graph incur either significant communication
overhead between clients or a loss of available information to the training. We
introduce the Federated Graph Convolutional Network (FedGCN) algorithm, which
uses federated learning to train GCN models for semi-supervised node
classification with fast convergence and little communication. Compared to
prior methods that require communication among clients at each training round,
FedGCN clients only communicate with the central server in one pre-training
step, greatly reducing communication costs and allowing the use of homomorphic
encryption to further enhance privacy. We theoretically analyze the tradeoff
between FedGCN's convergence rate and communication cost under different data
distributions. Experimental results show that our FedGCN algorithm achieves
better model accuracy with 51.7% faster convergence on average and at least
100X less communication compared to prior work.

reward and an entropy reward. It is believed that the regularization imposed by
entropy, on both policy improvement and policy evaluation, together contributes
to good exploration, training convergence, and robustness of learned policies.
This paper takes a closer look at entropy as an intrinsic reward, by conducting
various ablation studies on soft actor-critic (SAC), a popular representative
of MaxEnt RL. Our findings reveal that in general, entropy rewards should be
applied with caution to policy evaluation. On one hand, the entropy reward,
like any other intrinsic reward, could obscure the main task reward if it is
not properly managed. We identify some failure cases of the entropy reward
especially in episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs), where it could cause
the policy to be overly optimistic or pessimistic. On the other hand, our
large-scale empirical study shows that using entropy regularization alone in
policy improvement, leads to comparable or even better performance and
robustness than using it in both policy improvement and policy evaluation.
Based on these observations, we recommend either normalizing the entropy reward
to a zero mean (SACZero), or simply removing it from policy evaluation
(SACLite) for better practical results.

Consequently, we can write down the Ehrhart polynomial of $P_M$, starting with
Katzman's formula for the Ehrhart polynomial of a hypersimplex. The method

Combinatorially, our construction corresponds to constructing a uniform matroid

evidence that panhandle matroids are Ehrhart positive and describe a

application of the main result, we calculate the Ehrhart polynomials of

of a twin variant remains a daunting task. We hypothesized that this
site-specific nucleation is sensitive to the prior atomic structure of the
lattice so twin embryos form in regions where the lattice transformation energy
is minimum. Thus, quantifying the local strain energy required to trigger a
stable twin underscores the non-pseudo-slip behavior of twin nucleation and
growth. We performed atomistic calculations based on the nudged elastic band

of its key properties. While the physics of particle filtration results in the
PFE being size-dependent, measurement standards are specified using a single,
integrated PFE, for simplicity. This integrated PFE is commonly defined with
respect to either the number (NBFE) or mass (MBFE) distribution of particles as
a function of size. This relationship is non-trivial; it is influenced by both
the shape of the particle distribution and the fact that multiple practical
definitions of particle size are used. This manuscript discusses the
relationship between NBFE and MBFE in detail, providing a guide to
practitioners. Our discussion begins with a theoretical discussion of the
underlying principles. We then present experimental results for a database of
size-resolved PFE (SPFE) measurements for over 900 candidate respirators and
filter media, including filter media with systematically varied properties and
commercial samples that span the 20%-99.8% MBFE. The observed relationships
between NBFE and MBFE are discussed in terms of the most-penetrating particle
size (MPPS) and charge state of the media. For the NaCl particles used here, we
observed that MBFEs were greater than NBFEs for charged materials and vice
versa for uncharged materials. This relationship is observed because a shift
from NBFE to MBFE weights the distribution towards larger sizes, while charged
materials shift the MPPS to smaller sizes. Results are validated by comparing
the output of a pair of TSI 8130As, a common instrument used in gauging
standards compliance, to that of MBFEs computed from a system capable of
measuring SPFE.

propose a new method for extracting finite automata from RNNs inspired by the
state merging paradigm from grammatical inference. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on the Tomita languages benchmark, where we find
that it is able to extract faithful automata from RNNs trained on all languages
in the benchmark. We find that extraction performance is aided by the number of
data provided during the extraction process, as well as, curiously, whether the
RNN model is trained for additional epochs after perfectly learning its target
language. We use our method to analyze this phenomenon, finding that training
beyond convergence is useful because it leads to compression of the internal
state space of the RNN. This finding demonstrates how our method can be used
for interpretability and analysis of trained RNN models.

importance to Computational Biology. For finding a walk in an arbitrary graph
with $|E|$ edges that exactly matches a pattern of length $m$, a lower bound
based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) implies an algorithm
significantly faster than $O(|E|m)$ time is unlikely [Equi et al., ICALP 2019].
However, for many special graphs, such as de Bruijn graphs, the problem can be
solved in linear time [Bowe et al., WABI 2012]. For approximate matching, the
picture is more complex. When edits (substitutions, insertions, and deletions)
are only allowed to the pattern, or when the graph is acyclic, the problem is
again solvable in $O(|E|m)$ time. When edits are allowed to arbitrary cyclic
graphs, the problem becomes NP-complete, even on binary alphabets [Jain et al.,
RECOMB 2019]. These results hold even when edits are restricted to only
substitutions. The complexity of approximate pattern matching on de Bruijn
graphs remained open. We investigate this problem and show that the properties
that make de Bruijn graphs amenable to efficient exact pattern matching do not
extend to approximate matching, even when restricted to the substitutions only
case with alphabet size four. We prove that determining the existence of a
matching walk in a de Bruijn graph is NP-complete when substitutions are
allowed to the graph. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm
significantly faster than $O(|E|m)$ is unlikely for de Bruijn graphs in the
case where only substitutions are allowed to the pattern. This stands in
contrast to pattern-to-text matching where exact matching is solvable in linear
time, like on de Bruijn graphs, but approximate matching under substitutions is
solvable in subquadratic $O(n\sqrt{m})$ time, where $n$ is the text's length

sequence are permutated to find the low energy states satisfying the

generally impossible to achieve on conventional computers due to the
exponential growth of possibilities with the number of designable sites. Thus,
sampling methods are currently used as a conventional approach to address the
protein design problems. Recently, quantum computation methods have shown the
potential to solve similar types of problems. In the present work, we use the
general idea of Grover's algorithm, a pure quantum computation method, to
design circuits at the gate-based level and address the protein design problem.
In our quantum algorithms, we use custom pair-wise energy tables consisting of
eight different amino acids. Also, the distance reciprocals between designable
sites are included in calculating energies in the circuits. Due to the noisy
state of current quantum computers, we mainly use quantum computer simulators
for this study. However, a very simple version of our circuits is implemented
on real quantum devices to examine their capabilities to run these algorithms.
Our results show that using $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt N)$ iterations, the circuits
find the correct results among all $N$ possibilities, providing the expected
quadratic speed up of Grover's algorithm over classical methods.

nonconvex and nonsmooth objective function in two steps. First, we prove
consensus formation of an associated mean-field dynamics by analyzing the
time-evolution of the variance of the particle distribution. We then show that
this consensus is close to a global minimizer by employing the asymptotic
Laplace principle and a tractability condition on the energy landscape of the
objective function. These results allow for the usage of memory mechanisms, and
hold for a rich class of objectives provided certain conditions of
well-preparation of the hyperparameters and the initial datum. In a second
step, at least for the case without memory effects, we provide a quantitative
result about the mean-field approximation of particle swarm optimization, which
specifies the convergence of the interacting particle system to the associated
mean-field limit. Combining these two results allows for global convergence
guarantees of the numerical particle swarm optimization method with provable
polynomial complexity. To demonstrate the applicability of the method we

broadcasting class centers among clients is crucial for recognition
performances but leads to privacy leakage. To resolve the privacy-utility

components: First, a practical Differentially Private Local Clustering (DPLC)
mechanism is proposed to distill sanitized clusters from local class centers.
Second, a consensus-aware recognition loss subsequently encourages global
consensuses among clients, which ergo results in more discriminative features.
The proposed framework is mathematically proved to be differentially private,
introducing a lightweight overhead as well as yielding prominent performance
boosts (\textit{e.g.}, +9.63\% and +10.26\% for TAR@FAR=1e-4 on IJB-B and IJB-C

  Models via Efficient Large-Batch Adversarial Noise",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, large pre-trained Transformer-based language models have led
to dramatic improvements in many natural language understanding tasks. To train
these models with increasing sizes, many neural network practitioners attempt
to increase the batch sizes in order to leverage multiple GPUs to improve
training speed. However, increasing the batch size often makes the optimization
more difficult, leading to slow convergence or poor generalization that can
require orders of magnitude more training time to achieve the same model
quality. In this paper, we explore the steepness of the loss landscape of
large-batch optimization for adapting pre-trained Transformer-based language
models to domain-specific tasks and find that it tends to be highly complex and
irregular, posing challenges to generalization on downstream tasks.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose ScaLA, a novel and efficient method to
accelerate the adaptation speed of pre-trained transformer networks. Different
from prior methods, we take a sequential game-theoretic approach by adding
lightweight adversarial noise into large-batch optimization, which
significantly improves adaptation speed while preserving model generalization.
Experiment results show that ScaLA attains 2.7--9.8$\times$ adaptation speedups
over the baseline for GLUE on BERT-base and RoBERTa-large, while achieving
comparable and sometimes higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art large-batch
optimization methods. Finally, we also address the theoretical aspect of
large-batch optimization with adversarial noise and provide a theoretical
convergence rate analysis for ScaLA using techniques for analyzing non-convex
saddle-point problems.

benefits to distributed MIMO C-RAN, but the corresponding high fronthaul data
loads can be problematic in practical systems with limited fronthaul capacity.
In this work we propose the use of lossy dimension reduction, applied locally
at each remote radio head (RRH), to reduce this fronthaul traffic. We first
consider the uplink, and the case where each RRH applies a linear dimension
reduction filter to its multi-antenna received signal vector. It is shown that
under a joint mutual information criteria, the optimal dimension reduction
filters are given by a variant of the conditional Karhunen-Loeve transform,
with a stationary point found using block co-ordinate ascent. These filters are
then modified such that each RRH can calculate its own dimension reduction
filter in a decentralised manner, using knowledge only of its own instantaneous
channel and network slow fading coefficients. We then show that in TDD systems
these dimension reduction filters can be re-used as part of a two-stage reduced
dimension downlink precoding scheme. Analysis and numerical results demonstrate
that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both uplink and downlink
fronthaul traffic whilst incurring very little loss in MIMO performance.

a more complex Hidden Markov Model with continuous output densities. In this

soliton dynamics in dependence on the main bifurcation parameter of the

These models capture the non-trivial decay of correlations in jump widths and

anti-persistent walk episodes, and the multimodal density of the jump widths.
We demonstrate that there exists a physically meaningful reduction of the

Such a source model is motivated by the recent surge of interest in the
semantic aspect of information: the intrinsic state corresponds to the semantic
feature of the source, which in general is not observable but can only be
inferred from the extrinsic observation. There are two distortion measures, one
between the intrinsic state and its reproduction, and the other between the
extrinsic observation and its reproduction. Under a given code rate, the
tradeoff between these two distortion measures is characterized by the
rate-distortion function, which is solved via the indirect rate-distortion
theory and is termed as the semantic rate-distortion function of the source. As
an application of the general model and its analysis, the case of Gaussian
extrinsic observation is studied, assuming a linear relationship between the
intrinsic state and the extrinsic observation, under a quadratic distortion
structure. The semantic rate-distortion function is shown to be the solution of
a convex programming programming problem with respect to an error covariance

maintaining the computation in the analog domain for the entire deep neural

Thus, in this paper, we investigate the effect of wire parasitic resistance and
capacitance on the accuracy of DNN models deployed on fully-analog IMC

impact of the parasitic while keeping the computation in the analog domain
through dividing large arrays into multiple partitions. The SPICE circuit
simulation results for a 400 X 120 X 84 X 10 DNN model deployed on a

MNIST classification application with 16, 8, and 8 horizontal partitions, as
well as 8, 8, and 1 vertical partitions for first, second, and third layers of
the DNN, respectively, which is comparable to the ~97% accuracy realized by
digital implementation on CPU. It is shown that accuracy benefits are achieved
at the cost of higher power consumption due to the extra circuitry required for
handling partitioning.

arbitrarily connected and each of them has limited memorizing capabilities and
communication bandwidth. The goal is to let each of the agents eventually learn
the best arm. It is assumed in these studies that the communication graph
should be complete or well-structured, whereas such an assumption is not always
valid in practice. Furthermore, limited memorization and communication
bandwidth also restrict the collaborations of the agents, since the agents
memorize and communicate very few experiences. Additionally, an agent may be
corrupted to share falsified experiences to its peers, while the resource limit
in terms of memorization and communication may considerably restrict the
reliability of the learning process. To address the above issues, we propose a
three-staged collaborative learning algorithm. In each step, the agents share
their latest experiences with each other through light-weight random walks in a
general communication graph, and then make decisions on which arms to pull
according to the recommendations received from their peers. The agents finally
update their adoptions (i.e., preferences to the arms) based on the reward
obtained by pulling the arms. Our theoretical analysis shows that, when there
are a sufficient number of agents participating in the collaborative learning
process, all the agents eventually learn the best arm with high probability,
even with limited memorizing capabilities and light-weight communications. We
also reveal in our theoretical analysis the upper bound on the number of

applications ranging from school choice and medical residency to ridesharing

disjoint sets of agents wherein no pair of agents prefer each other to their
matched partners. The Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm is an elegant
procedure that guarantees a stable matching for any input; however, its outcome
may be unfair as it always favors one side by returning a matching that is
optimal for one side (say men) and pessimal for the other side (say women). A
desirable fairness notion is minimizing the sex-equality cost, i.e. the
difference between the total rankings of both sides. Computing such stable
matchings is a strongly NP-hard problem, which raises the question of what
tractable algorithms to adopt in practice. We conduct a series of empirical
evaluations on the properties of sex-equal stable matchings when preferences of
agents on both sides are correlated. Our empirical results suggest that under
correlated preferences, the DA algorithm returns stable matchings with low
sex-equality cost, which further confirms its broad use in many practical

address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel non-linear class of model
aggregation functions to achieve efficient DML over time-varying networks.
Instead of taking a linear aggregation of neighboring models as most existing
studies do, our mechanism uses a nonlinear aggregation, a weighted power-p mean
(WPM), as the aggregation function of local models from neighbors. The
subsequent optimizing steps are taken using mirror descent defined by a Bregman
divergence that maintains convergence to optimality. In this paper, we analyze
properties of the WPM and rigorously prove convergence properties of our
aggregation mechanism. Additionally, through extensive experiments, we show
that when p > 1, our design significantly improves the convergence speed of the
model and the scalability of DML under time-varying networks compared with
arithmetic mean aggregation functions, with little additional computation
overhead.

incentive-compatible mechanism that maximizes the auctioneer's expected
revenue. While theoretical approaches have encountered bottlenecks in
multi-item auctions, recently, there has been much progress on finding the
optimal mechanism through deep learning. However, these works either focus on a
fixed set of bidders and items, or restrict the auction to be symmetric. In
this work, we overcome such limitations by factoring \emph{public} contextual
information of bidders and items into the auction learning framework. We
propose $\mathtt{CITransNet}$, a context-integrated transformer-based neural
network for optimal auction design, which maintains permutation-equivariance
over bids and contexts while being able to find asymmetric solutions. We show
by extensive experiments that $\mathtt{CITransNet}$ can recover the known
optimal solutions in single-item settings, outperform strong baselines in
multi-item auctions, and generalize well to cases other than those in training.

orthogonalization, for federated learning (FL) in a massive multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) wireless system. The key novelty of random
orthogonalization comes from the tight coupling of FL model aggregation and two
unique characteristics of massive MIMO - channel hardening and favorable
propagation. As a result, random orthogonalization can achieve natural
over-the-air model aggregation without requiring transmitter side channel state
information, while significantly reducing the channel estimation overhead at
the receiver. Theoretical analyses with respect to both communication and
machine learning performances are carried out. In particular, an explicit
relationship among the convergence rate, the number of clients and the number
of antennas is established. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
efficiency of random orthogonalization for FL in massive MIMO.

$\sim1,000\ \mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$, and are clearly detected in hydrogen Balmer

ionization parameter $U\approx10^{-1.2}$, thereupon located it at
$r_{\mathrm{abs}}\approx1.5$ pc from the central supermassive black hole. The
inferred distance is remarkably similar to the evaporation radius for dust
grains $r_{\mathrm{evap}}\approx1$ pc in the quasar. Thus the absorber may be a
probe of an inflow starting from the dusty torus and feeding the accretion
disk. Both the featureless continuum and the broad emission lines are heavily
reddened with $E(B-V)\approx0.66$, in contrast to the narrow emission lines
whose reddening is negligible. The dusty medium could be located in between the
broad and narrow emission line regions, and possibly be associated with a
'cold' narrow absorption line system detected in \ion{Ca}{2} and \ion{Na}{1}

defined on the 2-dimensional square lattice. Each height function corresponds
to a configuration of the six vertex model on the infinite square lattice. We
focus on the stochastic six vertex model corresponding to a particular
two-parameter family of weights within the ferroelectric regime. It is believed
(and partially proven, see Aggarwal, arXiv:2004.13272) that the stochastic six
vertex model displays nontrivial pure (i.e., translation invariant and ergodic)
Gibbs states of two types, KPZ and liquid. These phases have very different
long-range correlation structure. The Markov processes we construct preserve
the KPZ pure states in the full plane. We also show that the same processes put
on the torus preserve arbitrary Gibbs measures for generic six vertex weights
(not necessarily in the ferroelectric regime).
  Our dynamics arise naturally from the Yang-Baxter equation for the six vertex
model via its bijectivisation, a technique first used in Bufetov-Petrov
(arXiv:1712.04584). The dynamics we construct are irreversible; in particular,
the height function has a nonzero average drift. In each KPZ pure state, we
explicitly compute the average drift (also known as the current) as a function
of the slope. We use this to analyze the hydrodynamics of a non-stationary
version of our process acting on quarter plane stochastic six vertex
configurations. The fixed-time limit shapes in the quarter plane model were
obtained in Borodin-Corwin-Gorin (arXiv:1407.6729).

effective in preventing deep networks from overfitting noisy labels. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the effect of
contrastive learning on boosting robustness is very limited. In this work, we
rigorously prove that the representation matrix learned by contrastive learning
boosts robustness, by having: (i) one prominent singular value corresponding to
each sub-class in the data, and significantly smaller remaining singular
values; and (ii) {a large alignment between the prominent singular vectors and
the clean labels of each sub-class. The above properties enable a linear layer
trained on such representations to effectively learn the clean labels without
overfitting the noise.} We further show that the low-rank structure of the
Jacobian of deep networks pre-trained with contrastive learning allows them to
achieve a superior performance initially, when fine-tuned on noisy labels.
Finally, we demonstrate that the initial robustness provided by contrastive
learning enables robust training methods to achieve state-of-the-art
performance under extreme noise levels, e.g., an average of 27.18\% and 15.58\%
increase in accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with 80\% symmetric noisy

MLLMs by reducing lexical overlap among closely related languages. Therefore,
transliterating closely related languages that use different writing scripts to
a common script may improve the downstream task performance of MLLMs. In this
paper, we pretrain two ALBERT models to empirically measure the effect of

evaluate our models on the IndicGLUE benchmark. We perform Mann-Whitney U test

negatively affecting the comparatively high-resource languages. We also measure
the cross-lingual representation similarity (CLRS) of the models using centered

matrix ensembles with $k$-body interactions are re-examined and it is shown
that the density of states, transition strength densities and strength
functions (partial densities) in fact follow more closely the $q$-normal
distribution (the parameter $q$ is related to the fourth moment of these
distributions with $q=1$ giving Gaussian and $q=0$ giving semi-circle form).
The $q$-normal has the important property that it is bounded for $0 \le q < 1$.
The $q$-normal (also its bivariate and general multi-variate extensions) and
the associated $q$-Hermite polynomials are studied for their properties by
Bryc, Szabowski and others [P.J. Szabowski, Electronic Journal of Probability
{\bf 15}, 1296 (2010)]. Following these, in the present article developed is
statistical nuclear spectroscopy based on $q$-normal (univariate and bivariate)
distributions and the associated $q$-Hermite polynomials. In particular,
formulation is presented for nuclear level densities, shell model orbit
occupancies, transition strengths (for electromagnetic and $\beta$ and double
$\beta$-decay type operators) and strength sums.

Although there exist various solutions that try to address the bottleneck of FL

proposes a novel data-based device grouping approach that can effectively
reduce the disadvantages of weight divergence during the training of non-IID

binary black holes (sBBHs) with (total) masses up to $\sim 150M_\odot$, which
are potential sources for space-based GW detectors, such as LISA and Taiji. In
this paper, we investigate in details on the possibility of detecting sBBHs by
the LISA-Taiji network in future. We adopt the sBBH merger rate density
constrained by LIGO/VIRGO observations to randomly generate mock sBBHs samples.
Assuming an observation period of $4$ years, we find that the LISA-Taiji
network may detect several tens (or at least several) sBBHs with
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $>8$ (or $>15$), a factor $2-3$ times larger than
that by only using LISA or Taiji observations. Among these sBBHs, no more than
a few that can merge during the $4$-year observation period. If extending the
observation period to $10$ years, then the LISA-Taiji network may detect about
one hundred (or twenty) sBBHs with SNR $>8$ (or $>15$), among them about twenty
(or at least several) can merge within the observation period. Our results
suggest that the LISA-Taiji network may be able to detect at least a handful to
twenty or more sBBHs even if assuming a conservative SNR threshold ($15$) for
``detection'', which enables multi-band GW observations by space and
ground-based GW detectors. We also further estimate the uncertainties in the
parameter estimations of the sBBH systems ``detected'' by the LISA-Taiji

measurements and sky localization are mostly in the range of $0.05-0.2$ and
$1-100\deg^2$, respectively, for these sBBHs.

$T_H$, which correspond to energy scales of the local flux and the itinerant
Majorana fermion, respectively. At low temperatures $(T\ll T_L)$, an almost
flux-free state is realized and the spin excitation propagates in a similar way

one of the edges, the itinerant Majorana fermions propagate the spin
excitations even through the quantum spin liquid state region, and oscillations
in the spin moment appear in the other edge with a tiny magnetic field. When
$T\sim T_L$, larger oscillations in the spin moments are induced in the other

excited $Z_2$ fluxes disturb the coherent motion of the itinerant Majorana

as standard sirens to constrain cosmological parameters if their redshift can

(BBHs) may not have electromagnetic counterparts and thus have no direct
redshift measurements. These dark sirens may be still used to statistically
constrain cosmological parameters by combining their GW measured luminosity
distances and localization with deep redshift surveys of galaxies around it. We
investigate this dark siren method in detail by using mock BBH and galaxy
samples. We find that the Hubble constant can be constrained well with an
accuracy $\lesssim1\%$ with a few tens or more of BBH mergers at redshift up to
$1$ if GW observations can provide accurate estimates of their luminosity
distance (with relative error of $\lesssim0.01$) and localization
($\lesssim0.1~\rm{deg}^2$), though the constraint may be significantly biased
if the luminosity distance and localization errors are larger. We also
introduce a simple method to correct this bias and find it is valid when the
luminosity distance and localization errors are modestly large. We further
generate mock BBH samples, according to current constraints on BBH merger rate
and the distributions of BBH properties, and find that the Deci-hertz
Observatory (DO) in a half year observation period may detect about one hundred
BBHs with signal-to-noise ratio $\varrho\gtrsim30$, relative luminosity
distance error $\lesssim0.02$, and localization error $\lesssim0.01\rm{deg}^2$.
By applying the dark standard siren method, we find that the Hubble constant
can be constrained to the $\sim0.1-1\%$ level using these DO BBHs, an accuracy
comparable to the constraints obtained by using electromagnetic observations in
the near future, thus it may provide insight into the Hubble tension.

Most parcellation methods focus on the deep white matter (DWM), while fewer
methods address the superficial white matter (SWM) due to its complexity. We
propose a deep-learning-based framework, Superficial White Matter Analysis
(SupWMA), that performs an efficient and consistent parcellation of 198 SWM
clusters from whole-brain tractography. A point-cloud-based network is modified
for our SWM parcellation task, and supervised contrastive learning enables more
discriminative representations between plausible streamlines and outliers. We
perform evaluation on a large tractography dataset with ground truth labels and
on three independently acquired testing datasets from individuals across ages
and health conditions. Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, SupWMA
obtains a highly consistent and accurate SWM parcellation result. In addition,
the computational speed of SupWMA is much faster than other methods.

prove that the interior polynomial of a connected bipartite graph is
interpolating. We strengthen the known result on the degree of the interior

sessions to recommend the next item. In recent years, Graph neural networks
(GNN) based SBRs have become the mainstream of SBRs benefited from the
superiority of GNN in modeling complex dependencies. Based on a strong
assumption of adjacent dependency, any two adjacent items in a session are
necessarily dependent in most GNN-based SBRs. However, we argue that due to the
uncertainty and complexity of user behaviors, adjacency does not necessarily
indicate dependency. However, the above assumptions do not always hold in
actual recommendation scenarios, so it can easily lead to two drawbacks: (1)
false dependencies occur in the session because there are adjacent but not
really dependent items, and (2) the missing of true dependencies occur in the
session because there are non-adjacent but actually dependent items. These
drawbacks significantly affect item representation learning, degrading the
downstream recommendation performance. To address these deficiencies, we
propose a novel review-refined inter-item graph neural network (RI-GNN), which
utilizes topic information extracted from the reviews of items to improve
dependencies between items. Experiments on two public real-world datasets

learning methods for reconstruction are becoming increasingly used. However
potential issues in the validation of such methods, as well as their
generalizability, remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate important
aspects of the validation of self-supervised algorithms for reconstruction of
undersampled MR images: quantitative evaluation of prospective reconstructions,
potential differences between prospective and retrospective reconstructions,
suitability of commonly used quantitative metrics, and generalizability. Two
self-supervised algorithms based on self-supervised denoising and the deep
image prior were investigated. These methods are compared to a least squares
fitting and a compressed sensing reconstruction using in-vivo and phantom data.
Their generalizability was tested with prospectively under-sampled data from
experimental conditions different to the training. We show that prospective
reconstructions can exhibit significant distortion relative to retrospective
reconstructions/ground truth. Furthermore, pixel-wise quantitative metrics may
not capture differences in perceptual quality accurately, in contrast to a
perceptual metric. In addition, all methods showed potential for
generalization; however, generalizability is more affected by changes in
anatomy/contrast than other changes. We further showed that no-reference image
metrics correspond well with human rating of image quality for studying
generalizability. Finally, we showed that a well-tuned compressed sensing
reconstruction and learned denoising perform similarly on all data.

weighted residual empirical processes can detect local alternatives distinct
from the null at the fastest possible rate of order $n^{-1/2}$ but are not

transformed weighted residual empirical processes can be asymptotically
distribution-free, yet, unexpectedly, can only detect the local alternatives
converging to the null at a much slower rate of order $n^{-1/4}$, which is
somewhat different from existing asymptotically distribution-free tests based

The new model greatly improves data privacy and user experience, but brings new
challenges for app developers. First, it allows users to freely revoke granted
permissions. Hence, developers cannot assume that the permissions granted to an
app would keep being granted. Instead, they should make their apps carefully
check the permission status before invoking dangerous APIs. Second, the
permission specification keeps evolving, bringing new types of compatibility
issues into the ecosystem. To understand the impact of the challenges, we
conducted an empirical study on 13,352 popular Google Play apps. We found that
86.0% apps used dangerous APIs asynchronously after permission management and
61.2% apps used evolving dangerous APIs. If an app does not properly handle
permission revocations or platform differences, unexpected runtime issues may
happen and even cause app crashes. We call such Android Runtime Permission
issues as ARP bugs. Unfortunately, existing runtime permission issue detection
tools cannot effectively deal with the ARP bugs induced by asynchronous
permission management and permission specification evolution. To fill the gap,
we designed a static analyzer, Aper, that performs reaching definition and
dominator analysis on Android apps to detect the two types of ARP bugs. To
compare Aper with existing tools, we built a benchmark, ARPfix, from 60 real

allocates the subwindow and transmit power in multi-device terahertz (THz) band
Internet of Things (Tera-IoT) networks. Unlike the prior studies focusing
mostly on maximizing the sum distance, we incorporate both rate and
transmission distance into the objective function of our problem formulation
with key features of THz bands, including the spreading and molecular
absorption losses. More specifically, as a performance metric of Tera-IoT
networks, we adopt the transport capacity (TC), which is defined as the sum of
the rate-distance products over all users. This metric has been widely adopted
in large-scale ad hoc networks, and would also be appropriate for evaluating
the performance of various Tera-IoT applications. We then formulate an
optimization problem that aims at maximizing the TC. Moreover, motivated by the
importance of the transmission distance that is very limited due to the high
path loss in THz bands, our optimization problem is extended to the case of
allocating the subwindow, transmit power, and transmission distance. We show
how to solve our problems via an effective two-stage resource allocation
strategy. We demonstrate the superiority of our adaptive solution over
benchmark methods via intensive numerical evaluations for various environmental
setups of large-scale Tera-IoT networks.

  Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis","11 pages, 3 figures, 10 tables",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis
task which aims to extract the aspects from sentences and identify their

ABSA. Due to the expensive annotation for aspect terms, we often lack labeled
target domain data for fine-tuning. To address this problem, many approaches
have been proposed recently to transfer common knowledge in an unsupervised
way, but such methods have too many modules and require expensive multi-stage
preprocessing. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective technique based
on mutual information maximization, which can serve as an additional component
to enhance any kind of model for cross-domain ABSA and ATE. Furthermore, we
provide some analysis of this approach. Experiment results show that our
proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for cross-domain ABSA
by 4.32% Micro-F1 on average over 10 different domain pairs. Apart from that,
our method can be extended to other sequence labeling tasks, such as named

cosmological model using observations of cosmic microwave background
anisotropies, it is still of great importance to independently measure this key
parameter using only late-universe observations in a cosmological
model-independent way. The distance sum rule in strong gravitational lensing
(SGL) provides such a way, provided that the three distances in the sum rule
can be calibrated by other observations. In this paper, we propose that
gravitational waves (GWs) can be used to provide the distance calibration in
the SGL method, which can avoid the dependence on distance ladder and cover a
wider redshift range. Using the simulated GW standard siren observation by the
Einstein Telescope as an example, we show that this scheme is feasible and
advantageous. We find that $\Delta\Omega_k\simeq 0.17$ with the current SGL
data, which is slightly more precise than the case of using SN to calibrate.
Furthermore, we consider the forthcoming LSST survey that is expected to
observe many SGL systems, and we find that about $10^4$ SGL data could provide
the precise measurement of $\Delta\Omega_k\simeq 10^{-2}$ with the help of GWs.
In addition, our results confirm that this method of constraining $\Omega_k$ is
strongly dependent on lens models. However, obtaining a more accurate
phenomenological model for lens galaxies is highly predictable as future
massive surveys observe more and more SGL samples, which will significantly
improve the constraint of cosmic curvature.

systems. In deep-learning context, the most common approach to deal with event
overlaps is to treat the AED task as a multi-label classification problem. By
doing this, we inherently consider multiple one-vs.-rest classification
problems, which are jointly solved by a single (i.e. shared) network. In this
work, to better handle polyphonic mixtures, we propose to frame the task as a
multi-class classification problem by considering each possible label
combination as one class. To circumvent the large number of arising classes due
to combinatorial explosion, we divide the event categories into multiple groups
and construct a multi-task problem in a divide-and-conquer fashion, where each
of the tasks is a multi-class classification problem. A network architecture is
then devised for multi-class multi-task modelling. The network is composed of a
backbone subnet and multiple task-specific subnets. The task-specific subnets
are designed to learn time-frequency and channel attention masks to extract
features for the task at hand from the common feature maps learned by the

complicated loss based on SkewIoU which is unfriendly to gradient-based

on Gaussian modeling and Gaussian product, which mainly consists of two items.
The first term is a scale-insensitive center point loss, which is used to
quickly narrow the distance between the center points of the two bounding
boxes. In the distance-independent second term, the product of the Gaussian
distributions is adopted to inherently mimic the mechanism of SkewIoU by its
definition, and show its alignment with the SkewIoU loss at trend-level within
a certain distance (i.e. within 9 pixels). This is in contrast to recent
Gaussian modeling based rotation detectors e.g. GWD loss and KLD loss that
involve a human-specified distribution distance metric which require additional
hyperparameter tuning that vary across datasets and detectors. The resulting
new loss called KFIoU loss is easier to implement and works better compared
with exact SkewIoU loss, thanks to its full differentiability and ability to
handle the non-overlapping cases. We further extend our technique to the 3-D
case which also suffers from the same issues as 2-D. Extensive results on
various public datasets (2-D/3-D, aerial/text/face images) with different base

we develop a new update patch for BN, particularly tailored for the
exemplar-based class-incremental learning (CIL). The main issue of BN in CIL is
the imbalance of training data between current and past tasks in a mini-batch,
which makes the empirical mean and variance as well as the learnable affine
transformation parameters of BN heavily biased toward the current task --
contributing to the forgetting of past tasks. While one of the recent BN
variants has been developed for ""online"" CIL, in which the training is done
with a single epoch, we show that their method does not necessarily bring gains
for ""offline"" CIL, in which a model is trained with multiple epochs on the
imbalanced training data. The main reason for the ineffectiveness of their
method lies in not fully addressing the data imbalance issue, especially in
computing the gradients for learning the affine transformation parameters of
BN. Accordingly, our new hyperparameter-free variant, dubbed as Task-Balanced
BN (TBBN), is proposed to more correctly resolve the imbalance issue by making
a horizontally-concatenated task-balanced batch using both reshape and repeat
operations during training. Based on our experiments on class incremental
learning of CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and five dissimilar task datasets, we
demonstrate that our TBBN, which works exactly the same as the vanilla BN in
the inference time, is easily applicable to most existing exemplar-based
offline CIL algorithms and consistently outperforms other BN variants.

establishing an unambiguous two-way mapping between spatially inhomogeneous

Remarkably, such arbitrariness cancels out in all physically measurable
properties (relaxed atomic structure and energetics) derived from the model,
pointing to a generalized translational covariance in the continuum description
of inhomogeneous ferroelectric structures. We demonstrate our claims with

for minimally invasive and non-invasive permittivity sensing for applications
such as detecting glucose levels in the interstitial dermal fluid. The
miniaturized, fully passive sensor is based on two symmetric parallel 0.8
mm$^3$ LC (inductor-capacitor) resonators. Each inductor is integrated with a
conductive plate at one of its terminals. The passive sensor's main field is
dominant outside the resonators, creating an effective capacitance outside the
sensor, unlike reported in previous studies where the effective capacitance was
limited to between the resonator lines. The proposed sensor was further
analyzed under two different scenarios to change the region of effective
capacitance and test its suitability for pressure monitoring, such as wound
monitoring; first, by repositioning one of the two resonators, and second, by
replacing one of the resonators with a conductive plate. The experimental
results confirmed the proposed passive sensor's performance in detecting the
glucose concentration in an aqueous solution with a sensitivity of 500 and 46
kHz/(mg/dL) for minimal invasive and non-invasive monitoring, respectively,
within the glucose range of 0-500 mg/dL with volume sample requirements as low
as 60 $\mu$L. Further, by repositioning one of the resonators, the effective
capacitance lies inside the passive sensor, making it suitable for wound
monitoring. The results indicated that the resonance shift can be made fairly
linear with respect to the variation in the separation between the resonators
with a sensitivity of 2.5$\times 10^3$ MHz/mm within the separation range of
0.2-0.5 mm, considering separation as the main factor to sense the pressure or
healing of the wound.

priority to design optimal antigen-specific CDRH3 regions to develop
therapeutic antibodies. However, the combinatorial nature of CDRH3 sequence

exhaustively and efficiently using computational approaches. Here, we present
\texttt{AntBO}: a combinatorial Bayesian optimisation framework enabling
efficient \textit{in silico} design of the CDRH3 region. Ideally, antibodies
are expected to have high target specificity and developability. We introduce a
CDRH3 trust region that restricts the search to sequences with favourable
developability scores to achieve this goal. For benchmarking, \texttt{AntBO}
uses the \texttt{Absolut!} software suite as a black-box oracle to score the
target specificity and affinity of designed antibodies \textit{in silico} in an
unconstrained fashion~\citep{robert2021one}. The experiments performed for
$159$ discretised antigens used in \texttt{Absolut!} demonstrate the benefit of
\texttt{AntBO} in designing CDRH3 regions with diverse biophysical properties.
In under $200$ calls to black-box oracle, \texttt{AntBO} can suggest antibody
sequences that outperform the best binding sequence drawn from 6.9 million
experimentally obtained CDRH3s and a commonly used genetic algorithm baseline.
Additionally, \texttt{AntBO} finds very-high affinity CDRH3 sequences in only
38 protein designs whilst requiring no domain knowledge. We conclude
\texttt{AntBO} brings automated antibody design methods closer to what is
practically viable for in vitro experimentation.

Meanwhile, the HR information is embedded in the downscaled low-resolution (LR)

the original HR images solely from the LR images. The key to supporting
arbitrary scale factors is our proposed Conditional Resampling Module (CRM)

data need to be collected by sensors and uploaded to the servers for further
process. As a promising solution, mobile crowd sensing enables controllable
sensing and transmission processes for multiple types of data in a single
device. In this paper, a typical user is considered that is required to sense
and transmit data to a server, while it is assumed to remain busy and incapable
of sensing data during an interval. An optimization problem is formulated to
minimize the energy consumption of data sensing and transmission by controlling
the sensing and transmission rates over time, subject to the constraints on the
sensing data sizes, transmission data sizes, data casualty, and sensing busy
time. This problem is highly challenging, due to the coupling between the rates
as well as the existence of the busy time. To deal with this problem, we first
show that it can be equivalently decomposed into two subproblems, corresponding
to a search for the amount of data size that needs to be sensed before the busy
time (referred to as the height), as well as the sensing and transmission rate
control given the height. Next, we show that the latter problem can be
efficiently solved by using the classical string-pulling method, while an
efficient algorithm is proposed to progressively find the optimal height
without the exhaustive search. Moreover, the solution approach is extended to a
more complex scenario where there is a finite-size buffer at the server for
receiving data. Last, simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of
the proposed design.

some users never buy certain products without coupons, while others do anyway.
Thus, how to select the right amount of incentives (i.e. treatment) to each

  The challenge is how to efficiently solve BTS problem on a Large-Scale

has proved its effectiveness in the diagnosis of brain diseases. However,
collecting the full set of well-aligned and paired data is impractical, since
the practical difficulties may include high cost, long time acquisition, image
corruption, and privacy issues. Previously, the misaligned unpaired
neuroimaging data (termed as MUD) are generally treated as noisy label.
However, such a noisy label-based method fail to accomplish well when
misaligned data occurs distortions severely. For example, the angle of rotation
is different. In this paper, we propose a novel federated self-supervised
learning (FedMed) for brain image synthesis. An affine transform loss (ATL) was
formulated to make use of severely distorted images without violating privacy
legislation for the hospital. We then introduce a new data augmentation
procedure for self-supervised training and fed it into three auxiliary heads,
namely auxiliary rotation, auxiliary translation and auxiliary scaling heads.
The proposed method demonstrates the advanced performance in both the quality
of our synthesized results under a severely misaligned and unpaired data

based on network flows from a mesoscopic perspective, we analytically derive a
community-aware information-theoretic centrality score based on network flow
and the coding principles behind the map equation: map equation centrality. Map
equation centrality measures how much further we can compress the network's
modular description by not coding for random walker transitions to the
respective node, using an adapted coding scheme and determining node importance
from a network flow-based point of view. The information-theoretic centrality
measure can be determined from a node's local network context alone because
changes to the coding scheme only affect other nodes in the same module. Map
equation centrality is agnostic to the chosen network flow model and allows
researchers to select the model that best reflects the dynamics of the process
under study. Applied to synthetic networks, we highlight how our approach
enables a more fine-grained differentiation between nodes than node-local or
network-global measures. Predicting influential nodes for two different
dynamical processes on real-world networks with traditional and other
community-aware centrality measures, we find that activating nodes based on map
equation centrality scores tends to create the largest cascades in a linear

Meanwhile, multi-level alignments are inherently consistent and able to

from multi-modal multi-level inputs, our framework is split into two stages,
the first stage focuses on intra-modality multi-level representation learning,
the second enforces interactions across modalities via both coarse-grained and
fine-grained semantic alignment tasks. In addition to the commonly used
image-text matching and masked language model tasks, we introduce a masked
concept recovering task in the first stage to enhance the concept
representation learning, and two more tasks in the second stage to explicitly

divide-and-conquer (DC), especially for asymmetric nonparametric models with
massive data. It is known that quantile-based methods can achieve the
robustness, but the quantile estimation for nonparametric regression has
non-ignorable bias when the error distribution is asymmetric. This paper
explores a global bias-corrected DC by quantile-matched composite for
nonparametric regressions with general error distributions. The proposed
strategies can achieve the bias-correction and robustness, simultaneously.
Unlike common DC quantile estimations that use an identical quantile level to
construct a local estimator by each local machine, in the new methodologies,
the local estimators are obtained at various quantile levels for different data
batches, and then the global estimator is elaborately constructed as a weighted
sum of the local estimators. In the weighted sum, the weights and quantile
levels are well-matched such that the bias of the global estimator is corrected
significantly, especially for the case where the error distribution is
asymmetric. Based on the asymptotic properties of the global estimator, the
optimal weights are attained, and the corresponding algorithms are then
suggested. The behaviors of the new methods are further illustrated by various
numerical examples from simulation experiments and real data analyses. Compared
with the competitors, the new methods have the favorable features of estimation
accuracy, robustness, applicability and computational efficiency.

observed in a semi-magnetic topological insulator heterostructure. However,the
heterostructure is metallic with a nonzero longitudinal conductance, which
contradicts the common belief that quantized Hall conductance is usually
observed in insulators.In this work,we systematically study the surface
transport of the semi-magnetic topological insulator with both gapped and
gapless Dirac surfaces in the presence of dephasing process.In particular, we
reveal that the HQHC is directly related to the half-quantized chiral current
along the edge of a strongly dephasing metal. The Hall conductance keeps a
half-quantized value for large dephasing strengths, while the longitudinal
conductance varies with Fermi energies and dephasing strengths. Furthermore, we
evaluate both the conductance and resistance as a function of the temperature,
which is consistent with the experimental results.Our results not only provide
the microscopic transport mechanism of the HQHC,but also are instructive for
the probe of the HQHC in future experiments.

to detect structured and unstructured road boundaries. The lateral offset and
head angle offset were fed to a fuzzy controller. The control input was
designed by Q-learning of the differential speed between the left and right

its own lane. 2D LiDAR was also used to measure the relative distance from the
front obstacle. The robot would immediately stop to avoid a collision when the
distance between the robot and obstacle was less than a specific safety

stable over almost 3 years at 6 GHz. To explain the constraints obtained both
from the detections and non-detections we considered multiple scenarios
including thermal and non-thermal emission, and different contributions from
each component of the binary. Our results can be well explained by non-thermal
gyrosynchrotron emission originating at radiation belts with a low plasma
density (n$_e$ = 300$-$700 cm$^{-3}$), a moderate magnetic field strength (B
$\approx$ 140 G), and an energy distribution of electrons following a power-law
($d N / d E \propto E^{- \delta}$) with $\delta$ fixed at 1.36. These radiation
belts would need to be present in both components and also be viewed
equatorially.

  Cardano's Formula and Khayyam's Geometric Solution","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.GM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Omar Khayyam's studies on cubic equations inspired the 12th century Persian
mathematician Sharaf al-Din Tusi to investigate the number of positive roots.
According to the noted mathematical historian Rashed, Tusi analyzed the problem
for five different types of equations. In fact all cubic equations are
reducible to a form {\it Tusi form} $x^2-x^3=c$. Tusi determined that the
maximum of $x^2-x^3$ on $(0,1)$ occurs at $\frac{2}{3}$ and concluded when
$c=\frac{4}{27} \delta$, $\delta \in (0,1)$, there are roots in $(0,
\frac{2}{3})$ and $(\frac{2}{3},1)$, ignoring the root in $(-\frac{1}{3},0)$.
Given a {\it reduced form} $x^3+px+q=0$, when $p <0$, we show it is reducible
to a Tusi form with $\delta = \frac{1}{2} + {3\sqrt{3} q}/{4\sqrt{-p^3}}$. It
follows there are three real roots if and only if $\Delta
=-(\frac{q^2}{4}+\frac{p^3}{27})$ is positive. This gives an explicit
connection between $\delta$ in Tusi form and $\Delta$ in Cardano's formula.
Thus when $\delta \in (0,1)$, rather than using Cardano's formula in complex
numbers one can approximate the roots iteratively. On the other hand, for a
reduced form with $p >0$ we give a novel proof of Cardono's formula. While
Rashed attributes Tusi's computation of the maximum to the use of derivatives,
according to Hogendijk, Tusi was probably influenced by Euclid. Here we show
the maximizer in Tusi form is computable via elementary algebraic
manipulations. Indeed for a {\it quadratic Tusi form}, $x-x^2=\delta/4$, Tusi's
approach results in a simple derivation of the quadratic formula, comparable
with the pedagogical approach of Po-Shen Loh. Moreover, we derive analogous
results for the {\it general Tusi form}. Finally, we present a novel derivation
of Khayyam's geometric solution. The results complement previous findings on
Tusi's work and reveal further facts on history, mathematics and pedagogy in
solving cubic equations.

Realizing the difficulty of obtaining data directly from RH companies, a stated

commuters. Sociodemographic attributes, current travel behavior and
transportation mode preference in an 8 km trip scenario using RH service and
its similar modes (auto and transit), were collected. A multinomial logit model
was used to estimate the time and cost coefficients for using RH services
across income groups, which was then used to estimate the value of time (VOT)

are also willing to pay more for using RH services. To examine the impact of RH
services on modal split in the city of Munich, we incorporated RH as a new mode
into an existing nested logit mode choice model using an incremental logit.
Travel time, travel cost and VOT were used as measures for the choice commuters
make when choosing between RH and its closest mode, metro. A total of 20
scenarios were evaluated at four different congestion levels and four price
levels to reflect the demand in response to acceptable costs and time
tradeoffs.

in experiment design that lead to over optimistic estimates of model
performance. Results: In this paper, we analyze the impact of several important
factors affecting generalization perfor-mance of CPI predictors that are
overlooked in existing work: 1. Similarity between training and test examples
in cross-validation 2. The strategy for generating negative examples, in the
absence of experimentally verified negative examples. 3. Choice of evaluation
protocols and performance metrics and their alignment with real-world use of
CPI predictors in screening large compound libraries. Using both an existing
state-of-the-art method (CPI-NN) and a proposed kernel based approach, we have
found that assessment of predictive performance of CPI predictors requires
careful con-trol over similarity between training and test examples. We also
show that random pairing for gen-erating synthetic negative examples for
training and performance evaluation results in models with better
generalization performance in comparison to more sophisticated strategies used
in existing studies. Furthermore, we have found that our kernel based approach,
despite its simple design, exceeds the prediction performance of CPI-NN. We
have used the proposed model for compound screening of several proteins

pulmonary disease analysis. In recent years, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have been widely used to delineate the bronchial tree. However, the
segmentation results of the CNN-based methods usually include many
discontinuous branches, which need manual repair in clinical use. A major
reason for the breakages is that the appearance of the airway wall can be
affected by the lung disease as well as the adjacency of the vessels, while the
network tends to overfit to these special patterns in the training set. To
learn robust features for these areas, we design a multi-branch framework that
adopts the geodesic distance transform to capture the intensity changes between
airway lumen and wall. Another reason for the breakages is the intra-class
imbalance. Since the volume of the peripheral bronchi may be much smaller than
the large branches in an input patch, the common segmentation loss is not
sensitive to the breakages among the distal branches. Therefore, in this paper,
a breakage-sensitive regularization term is designed and can be easily combined
with other loss functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on publicly
available datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our framework can
detect more branches while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

theoretically and numerically demonstrate for the first time that a pump beam

Langmuir waves arising from both backward and forward stimulated Raman

challenging. On top of that, in applications such as hate speech detection,
labeling a sufficiently large dataset containing offensive content can be
mentally and emotionally taxing for human annotators. Thus, NLP methods that
can make the best use of significantly less labeled data points are of great
interest. In this paper, we present a novel pool-based active learning method
that can be used for the training of large unlabeled corpus with minimum
annotation cost. For that, we propose to find the dominant sets of local

structures in the data. Then, the samples that do not belong to any of the
dominant sets are selected to be used to train the model, as they represent the
boundaries of the local clusters and are more challenging to classify. Our
proposed method does not have any parameters to be tuned, making it

accuracy as full training data, with significantly fewer data points.
Additionally, our method achieves a higher performance in comparison to the

In this paper, we focus on heart rate signals acquired using non-contact radar

signal noise removal method capable of adaptive determining filters. Currently,
the most common method of removing noise from such a waveform is through the
use of filters; the most popular filtering method amongst which is the wavelet
filter. There are, however, circumstances in which using a different filtering

this work, we propose Efficient PSRO (EPSRO) that largely improves the
efficiency of the above two steps. Central to our development is the
newly-introduced subroutine of no-regret optimization on the
unrestricted-restricted (URR) game. By solving URR at each epoch, one can
evaluate the current game and compute the best response in one forward pass
without the need for meta-game simulations. Theoretically, we prove that the
solution procedures of EPSRO offer a monotonic improvement on the
exploitability, which none of existing PSRO methods possess. Furthermore, we
prove that the no-regret optimization has a regret bound of

parallelizable, this allows for highly efficient exploration in the policy

multiplexing a set of orthogonal modes on the same frequency channel to achieve
high spectrum efficiencies. Since OAM requires precise alignment of the
transmit and the receive antennas, the electronic beam steering approach has
been proposed for the uniform circular array (UCA)-based OAM communication
system to circumvent large performance degradation induced by small antenna
misalignment in practical environment. However, in the case of large-angle
misalignment, the OAM channel capacity can not be effectively compensated only
by the electronic beam steering. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid
mechanical and electronic beam steering scheme, in which mechanical rotating
devices controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) signals as the execution
unit are utilized to eliminate the large misalignment angle, while electronic
beam steering is in charge of the remaining small misalignment angle caused by
perturbations. Furthermore, due to the interferometry, the receive
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are not uniform at the elements of the receive
UCA. Therefore, a rotatable UCA structure is proposed for the OAM receiver to
maximize the channel capacity, in which the simulated annealing algorithm is
adopted to obtain the optimal rotation angle at first, then the servo system
performs mechanical rotation, at last the electronic beam steering is adjusted
accordingly. Both mathematical analysis and simulation results validate that
the proposed hybrid mechanical and electronic beam steering scheme can
effectively eliminate the effect of diverse misalignment errors of any
practical OAM channel and maximize the OAM channel capacity.

singers during singing, speaking, laughing, and recitation of poetry. We also
conducted measurements with a flute, a clarinet, a tuba, and only the tuba's
mouthpiece. To be able to image and track droplets, we have developed and built
a portable measurement set-up. We have detected droplets with diameters of
approximately 50 micrometre and above. We found that for a single subject, the
largest amount of droplets are produced during singing, but that laughing can
produce a comparable number of droplets. Speaking and recitation of poetry do
not produce as many droplets. We repeated exercises at varying distances and
found that the number of detected droplets decreased rapidly with increasing
distance. Most droplets we detected follow a ballistic trajectory, and hit the
ground after a distance of approximately 1 m. In case of the musical
instruments, we did not detect droplets exiting a tuba and only few single
droplets from a flute and a clarinet. A clarinet usually points downwards, such
that droplets follow a downward trajectory and hit the ground after a short
distance. The situation was different when the tubist used only the mouthpiece
(that is, detached from the tuba) during warm-up while partially blocking the
opening with a finger: in this case, many droplets were ejected from the
mouthpiece. These followed ballistic trajectories at different speeds, with
some droplets exiting the measurement volume. Two important limitations of this
study are that (i) the sample size is very small, such that a statistical
analysis is beyond our scope; and (ii) that we cannot draw conclusions about a
possible risk of infection with COVID-19 when performing any of the said
activities.

the multiple modes of conveying information through text, image, video and/or

misinformation/disinformation detection in multi-modal news sources (including
text and images) through our simple, yet effective, approach in the FACTIFY
shared task at De-Factify@AAAI2022. Our model produced an F1-weighted score of
74.807%, which was the fourth best out of all the submissions. In this paper we
will explain our approach to undertake the shared task.

of the space that respects Lorentz symmetry as well as gauge symmetry through
setting an equivalency between linear GUP correction term and electromagnetic
interaction term in Dirac equation. We derived a wavefunction solution that
satisfies this equivalency. This discreteness may explain the crystal and
quasicrystal structures observed in nature at different energy scales.
