these deviations in terms of the non-additive entropy of the photon system
interacting with the heterogeneous combustion products, which makes it possible
to use the non-extensive Tsallis thermodynamics for their description. It is
assumed that the non-additive character of the radiation entropy in
heterogeneous plasma can be explained by the influence of long-range
interactions and non-equilibrium physicochemical processes. An expression is
obtained for the energy-dependent distribution of the photon density, based on
the phenomenological parameter of non-extensiveness $q$ which, in the first
approximation, does not depend on the energy. In this case, the ""non-extensive""
Planck's law can be reduced to the ""usual"" Planck distribution by introducing
the ""effective temperature"" that exceeds the real temperature. Numerical
modelling has shown that the spectral density of photons, the position and
magnitude of its maximum depend on the value of the parameter $q$, which can be
used for its experimental determination and revelation of its physical nature

determined by the trade-off between the competing parameters of the capability
to convert the incident light into electricity while allowing some parts to
transmit providing transparency through the device. Depending on the target
application, the selection of ST-SCs is a tricky affair as some devices might
offer high efficiency but compromises transparency and vice-versa. On the other
way around, this is again not helped by the fact that due to advancements in
materials engineering, processing, and characterization, a vastly different

the power conversion efficiency of the device, bifaciality factor,

both pressure and shear stress at the solid-liquid interface, leading to
deformation of the cross-section, which affects the flow rate-pressure drop
relation. Conventionally, calculating this flow rate-pressure drop relation
requires solving the complete elastohydrodynamic problem, which couples the
fluid flow and elastic deformation. In this work, we use the reciprocal
theorems for Stokes flow and linear elasticity to derive a closed-form
expression for the flow rate-pressure drop relation in deformable channels,
bypassing the detailed calculation of the solution to the
fluid-structure-interaction problem. For small deformations (under a domain
perturbation scheme), our theory provides the leading-order effect, of the
interplay between the fluid stresses and the compliance of the channel, on the
flow rate-pressure drop relation. Our approach uses solely the fluid flow
solution and the elastic deformation due to the fluid stress distribution in an
undeformed channel, eliminating the need to solve the coupled
elastohydrodynamic problem. Unlike previous theoretical studies that neglected
the presence of lateral sidewalls and considered shallow geometries of
effectively infinite width, our approach allows to determine the influence of
confining sidewalls on the flow rate-pressure drop relation. For the
flow-rate-controlled situation and the plate-bending theory for the elastic
deformation, we show a trade-off between the effect of compliance of the
deforming top wall and the drag due to sidewalls on the pressure drop. While
increased compliance decreases the pressure drop, the effect of the sidewalls
increases it. Our theoretical framework may provide insight into existing
experimental data and pave the way for the design of novel optimized soft
microfluidic configurations of different cross-sectional shapes.

behavior of no-regret learning in min-max games with dependent strategy sets,
where the strategy of the first player constrains the behavior of the second.
Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e., min-max Stackelberg, games.
We consider two settings, one in which only the first player chooses their
actions using a no-regret algorithm while the second player best responds, and
one in which both players use no-regret algorithms. For the former case, we
show that no-regret dynamics converge to a Stackelberg equilibrium. For the
latter case, we introduce a new type of regret, which we call Lagrangian
regret, and show that if both players minimize their Lagrangian regrets, then
play converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We then observe that online mirror
descent (OMD) dynamics in these two settings correspond respectively to a known
nested (i.e., sequential) gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm and a new
simultaneous GDA-like algorithm, thereby establishing convergence of these
algorithms to Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the robustness of
OMD dynamics to perturbations by investigating online min-max Stackelberg
games. We prove that OMD dynamics are robust for a large class of online
min-max games with independent strategy sets. In the dependent case, we
demonstrate the robustness of OMD dynamics experimentally by simulating them in
online Fisher markets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game with
dependent strategy sets.

Despite the vaccination programmes for a year, hospitalization rates and deaths

COVID-19 screening measures such as temperature check and mask check at all
public places are helping reduce the spread of COVID-19. Visual inspections to
ensure these screening measures can be taxing and erroneous. Automated
inspection ensures an effective and accurate screening. Traditional approaches
involve identification of faces and masks from visual camera images followed by
extraction of temperature values from thermal imaging cameras. Use of visual
imaging as a primary modality limits these applications only for good-lighting
conditions. The use of thermal imaging alone for these screening measures makes
the system invariant to illumination. However, lack of open source datasets is
an issue to develop such systems. In this paper, we discuss our work on using
machine learning over thermal video streams for face and mask detection and
subsequent temperature screening in a passive non-invasive way that enables an
effective automated COVID-19 screening method in public places. We open source
our NTIC dataset that was used for training our models and was collected at 8
different locations. Our results show that the use of thermal imaging is as
effective as visual imaging in the presence of high illumination. This
performance stays the same for thermal images even under low-lighting
conditions, whereas the performance with visual trained classifiers show more
than 50% degradation.

starting points that do not end up at a Nash equilibrium. We also prove a
stronger result for $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria: there are games
such that no game dynamics can converge (in an appropriate sense) to
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria, and in fact the set of such games has positive

coincide very well with the fixed point of the initial ODEs. For the bistable

application using natural language requires both immense amounts of training
data and NLP expertise. This motivates CAT, which can be used to easily create
conversational agents for transactional databases. The main idea is that, for a
given OLTP database, CAT uses weak supervision to synthesize the required
training data to train a state-of-the-art conversational agent, allowing users
to interact with the OLTP database. Furthermore, CAT provides an out-of-the-box
integration of the resulting agent with the database. As a major difference to
existing conversational agents, agents synthesized by CAT are data-aware. This
means that the agent decides which information should be requested from the

results in markedly more efficient dialogues compared with non-data-aware
agents. We publish the code for CAT as open source.

easily fooled by images with tiny perturbations crafted by an adversary. There
has been a vast volume of research to generate and defend such adversarial
attacks. However, the following problem is left unexplored: How to
reverse-engineer adversarial perturbations from an adversarial image? This
leads to a new adversarial learning paradigm--Reverse Engineering of Deceptions
(RED). If successful, RED allows us to estimate adversarial perturbations and
recover the original images. However, carefully crafted, tiny adversarial
perturbations are difficult to recover by optimizing a unilateral RED
objective. For example, the pure image denoising method may overfit to
minimizing the reconstruction error but hardly preserve the classification
properties of the true adversarial perturbations. To tackle this challenge, we
formalize the RED problem and identify a set of principles crucial to the RED
approach design. Particularly, we find that prediction alignment and proper
data augmentation (in terms of spatial transformations) are two criteria to
achieve a generalizable RED approach. By integrating these RED principles with
image denoising, we propose a new Class-Discriminative Denoising based RED
framework, termed CDD-RED. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of CDD-RED under different evaluation metrics (ranging from the pixel-level,

database with geotagged satellite images. Our prior arts treat the above task
as pure image retrieval by selecting the most similar satellite reference image
matching the ground-level query image. However, such an approach often produces
coarse location estimates because the geotag of the retrieved satellite image
only corresponds to the image center while the ground camera can be located at
any point within the image. To further consolidate our prior research findings,
we present a novel geometry-aware geo-localization method. Our new method is
able to achieve the fine-grained location of a query image, up to pixel size
precision of the satellite image, once its coarse location and orientation have
been determined. Moreover, we propose a new geometry-aware image retrieval
pipeline to improve the coarse localization accuracy. Apart from a polar
transform in our conference work, this new pipeline also maps satellite image
pixels to the ground-level plane in the ground-view via a geometry-constrained
projective transform to emphasize informative regions, such as road structures,

passive colloids. Micro-robot rotation expands the ability to sculpt
interactions; the energy landscape around a rotating micro-robot is dynamically
reconfigured by complex far-from-equilibrium dynamics of the micro-robot's
companion topological defect. These defect dynamics allow transient information
to be programmed into the domain and exploited for top-down cargo manipulation.
We demonstrate robust micro-robotic manipulation strategies that exploit these

layer is for optimizing phase shift resolutions, and the lower one is for phase
shift beamforming and power allocation. Since the phase shift optimization is
an integer programming problem with a large-scale action space, we improve MAQ
by incorporating the Wolpertinger method, namely, MAQ-WP algorithm to achieve a
sub-optimality with reduced dimensions of action space. In addition, as MAQ-WP

reconstruction of high-resolution turbulent flows (aka super-resolution).
However, current DL approaches perform spatially uniform super-resolution - a
key performance limiter for scalability of DL-based surrogates for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
  To address the above challenge, we introduce NUNet, a deep learning-based
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for non-uniform super-resolution of
turbulent flows. NUNet divides the input low-resolution flow field into
patches, scores each patch, and predicts their target resolution. As a result,
it outputs a spatially non-uniform flow field, adaptively refining regions of
the fluid domain to achieve the target accuracy. We train NUNet with
Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions from three different canonical
flows, namely turbulent channel flow, flat plate, and flow around ellipses.
NUNet shows remarkable discerning properties, refining areas with complex flow
features, such as near-wall domains and the wake region in flow around solid
bodies, while leaving areas with smooth variations (such as the freestream) in
the low-precision range. Hence, NUNet demonstrates an excellent qualitative and
quantitative alignment with the traditional OpenFOAM AMR solver. Moreover, it
reaches the same convergence guarantees as the AMR solver while accelerating it
by 3.2-5.5x, including unseen-during-training geometries and boundary
conditions, demonstrating its generalization capacities. Due to NUNet's ability
to super-resolve only regions of interest, it predicts the same target
1024x1024 spatial resolution 7-28.5x faster than state-of-the-art DL methods

signals were analytically computed via stochastic geometry tools. Then the
distribution of the received signal over the MAC are approximated by Gaussian
and log-normal distributions via moment matching. This enabled the derivation
of moment matching optimal fusion rules (MOR)for both distributions. Moreover,
suboptimal simpler fusion rules were also proposed, in which all the CHs data
are equally weighed, which is termed moment matching equal gain fusion rule
(MER). It is shown by simulations that increasing the number of clusters
improve the performance. Moreover, MOR-Gaussian based algorithms are better
under free-space propagation whereas their lognormal counterparts are more
suited in the ground-reflection case. Also, the latter algorithms show better
results in low SNR and SN numbers conditions. We have proved that the received
power at the CH in MAC is proportional O(2R2) and to O(2ln2R) in the free-space
propagation and the ground-reflection cases respectively, whereis SN deployment
intensity and R is the cluster radius. This implies that having more clusters
decreases the required transmission power for a given SNR at the receiver.

been proposed as a combined explanation of the anomalous $b \to s\mu^+\mu^-$
and $b \to c \tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$ data (the so-called $B$ meson anomalies). In
this work, we carry out an updated view of the TVB model by incorporating the
most recent 2022 and 2023 LHCb measurements on the lepton flavor universality
ratios $R(D^{(\ast)}) = {\rm BR}(B \to D^{(\ast)}\tau \bar{\nu}_\tau)/{\rm

fit to explore the allowed parameter space by the new data and all relevant
low-energy flavor observables. Our results are confronted with the recent
high-mass dilepton searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We find that
for a heavy TVB mass of 1 TeV a common explanation of the $B$ meson anomalies
is possible for all data with the recent LHCb measurements on $R(D^{(\ast)})$,
in consistency with LHC constraints. However, this framework is in strong
tension with LHC bounds when one considers all data along with the world
average values (BABAR, Belle, and LHCb) on $R(D^{(\ast)})$. Future measurements

valid mountain-valley (MV) assignments $\mu:E\to\{-1,1\}$, indicating which
creases can be mountains (convex) or valleys (concave) to allow $R$ to
physically fold flat without self-intersecting. In this paper, we initiate the
first study of how valid MV assignments of single-vertex crease patterns are
related to one another via face-flips, a concept that emerged from applications
of origami in engineering and physics, where flipping a face $F$ means
switching the MV parity of all creases of $C$ that border $F$. Specifically, we
study the origami flip graph ${\rm{OFG}}(C)$, whose vertices are all valid MV
assignments of $C$ and edges connect assignments that differ by only one face
flip. We prove that, for the single-vertex crease pattern $A_{2n}$ whose $2n$
sector angles around the vertex are all equal, ${\rm{OFG}}(A_{2n})$ contains as
subgraphs all other origami flip graphs of degree-$2n$ flat origami vertex
crease patterns. We also prove that ${\rm{OFG}}(A_{2n})$ is connected and has
diameter $n$ by providing two $O(n^2)$ algorithms to traverse between vertices
in the graph, and we enumerate the vertices, edges, and degree sequence of
${\rm{OFG}}(A_{2n})$. We conclude with open questions on the surprising

different algorithmic choices for deep AUROC optimization problem. We study the
loss functions in two categories: pairwise loss and composite loss, which
includes a total of 10 loss functions. Interestingly, we find composite loss,
as an innovative loss function class, shows more competitive performance than
pairwise loss from both training convergence and testing generalization
perspectives. Nevertheless, data with more corrupted labels favors a pairwise
symmetric loss. (ii) Moreover, we benchmark and highlight the essential
algorithmic choices such as positive sampling rate, regularization,
normalization/activation, and optimizers. Key findings include: higher positive
sampling rate is likely to be beneficial for deep AUROC maximization; different
datasets favors different weights of regularizations; appropriate normalization
techniques, such as sigmoid and $\ell_2$ score normalization, could improve
model performance. (iii) For optimization aspect, we benchmark SGD-type,
Momentum-type, and Adam-type optimizers for both pairwise and composite loss.
Our findings show that although Adam-type method is more competitive from
training perspective, but it does not outperform others from testing
perspective.

multi-antenna systems such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).
For massive MIMO operating at millimeter-wave bands, hybrid analog-digital
structure has been adopted to reduce the cost of radio frequency (RF) chains.
In this situation, signals received at the antennas are unavailable to the
digital receiver, and as a consequence, traditional sample average approach
cannot be used for SCM reconstruction in hybrid massive MIMO. To address this
issue, beam sweeping algorithm (BSA), which can reconstruct SCM effectively in
hybrid massive MIMO, has been proposed in our previous work. In this paper, a
truncated BSA is further proposed for SCM reconstruction by taking into account
the patterns of antenna elements in the array. Due to the directive antenna
pattern, sweeping results corresponding to predetermined direction-of-angles
(DOA) far from the normal direction are small and thus can be replaced by
predetermined constants. At the cost of negligible performance reduction, SCM
can be reconstructed efficiently by sweeping only the predetermined DOAs that
are close to the normal direction. In this way, BSA can be conducted much
faster than its traditional counterpart. Insightful analysis will be also
included to show the impact of truncation on the performance.

  Perspective","Accepted as ICLR'22 Spotlight Paper",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The lack of adversarial robustness has been recognized as an important issue
for state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural networks
(DNNs). Thereby, robustifying ML models against adversarial attacks is now a
major focus of research. However, nearly all existing defense methods,
particularly for robust training, made the white-box assumption that the
defender has the access to the details of an ML model (or its surrogate
alternatives if available), e.g., its architectures and parameters. Beyond
existing works, in this paper we aim to address the problem of black-box
defense: How to robustify a black-box model using just input queries and output
feedback? Such a problem arises in practical scenarios, where the owner of the
predictive model is reluctant to share model information in order to preserve
privacy. To this end, we propose a general notion of defensive operation that
can be applied to black-box models, and design it through the lens of denoised
smoothing (DS), a first-order (FO) certified defense technique. To allow the
design of merely using model queries, we further integrate DS with the
zeroth-order (gradient-free) optimization. However, a direct implementation of
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization suffers a high variance of gradient estimates,
and thus leads to ineffective defense. To tackle this problem, we next propose
to prepend an autoencoder (AE) to a given (black-box) model so that DS can be
trained using variance-reduced ZO optimization. We term the eventual defense as
ZO-AE-DS. In practice, we empirically show that ZO-AE- DS can achieve improved
accuracy, certified robustness, and query complexity over existing baselines.
And the effectiveness of our approach is justified under both image
classification and image reconstruction tasks. Codes are available at

motivating the well-studied long-tailed recognition (LTR) problem. Naive
training produces models that are biased toward common classes in terms of
higher accuracy. The key to addressing LTR is to balance various aspects
including data distribution, training losses, and gradients in learning. We
explore an orthogonal direction, weight balancing, motivated by the empirical
observation that the naively trained classifier has ""artificially"" larger
weights in norm for common classes (because there exists abundant data to train
them, unlike the rare classes). We investigate three techniques to balance
weights, L2-normalization, weight decay, and MaxNorm. We first point out that
L2-normalization ""perfectly"" balances per-class weights to be unit norm, but
such a hard constraint might prevent classes from learning better classifiers.
In contrast, weight decay penalizes larger weights more heavily and so learns
small balanced weights; the MaxNorm constraint encourages growing small weights
within a norm ball but caps all the weights by the radius. Our extensive study
shows that both help learn balanced weights and greatly improve the LTR
accuracy. Surprisingly, weight decay, although underexplored in LTR,
significantly improves over prior work. Therefore, we adopt a two-stage
training paradigm and propose a simple approach to LTR: (1) learning features
using the cross-entropy loss by tuning weight decay, and (2) learning
classifiers using class-balanced loss by tuning weight decay and MaxNorm. Our
approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy on five standard benchmarks,
serving as a future baseline for long-tailed recognition.

laser-induced electron displacement [Geng L et al. 2021 Phys. Rev. A 104(2)

also present in the tunneling and over-barrier regime of ionization by short
pulses. However, the electron displacement is now induced by the electric field
component of the laser pulse, instead of by the magnetic field component in the
case of the superintense XUV pulse. After corresponding modifications to our
quantum and semiclassical models, we find the same physical mechanism of the

relative strength of X-ray and optical emission, and we see a trend in galaxy
properties between these subsets: X-ray overluminous groups contain a lower
fraction of both blue and star forming galaxies compared with X-ray
underluminous systems. X-ray overluminous groups also have a more dominant
central galaxy, with a magnitude gap between first and second ranked galaxies
on average 0.22 mag larger than in underluminous groups. The central galaxy in
overluminous groups also lies closer to the centre of the group. We examine a
number of other structural properties of our groups, such as axis ratio,
velocity dispersion, and group crossing time and find trends with X-ray
emission in some of these properties despite the high stochastic noise from the
limited number of group galaxies. We attribute the trends we see to the
evolutionary state of groups, with X-ray overluminous systems being more
dynamically evolved than underluminous groups. The X-ray overluminous groups
have had more time to develop a luminous intragroup medium, quench member
galaxies, and build the mass of the central galaxy through mergers compared to
underluminous groups. However, a minority of X-ray underluminous groups have
properties that suggest them to be dynamically mature. The lack of hot gas in
these systems cannot be accounted for by high star formation efficiency,
suggesting that high gas entropy resulting from feedback is the likely cause of
their weak X-ray emission.

its ornamental value but also its extractions for chemical and medical uses. It
is necessary to store its seeds as backup resources. Cryopreservation is the
reliable, cost-effective method for long-term preservation of botanical genetic
banks, especially for recalcitrant plants. In this study, we demonstrated that
due to unable to tolerate desiccation and low-temperature, N. caerulea is
recalcitrant. Since viability was lost before 6 months storage, N. caerulea
seeds were not appropriate to long-term store by traditional storage method.
The only way to long-term store N. caerulea seeds is cryopreservation. However,
Plant Vitrification Solution 3 (PVS3; 50% w/v sucrose, 50% w/v glycerol), a
commonly used plant vitrification solution, was ineffective on N. caerulea
seeds cryopreservation. The maximum survival rate of cryopreserved seeds
treated by PVS3 was only 23%. Oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation within seeds was the reason to cause inefficiency of
PVS3 treated seeds cryopreservation. We developed a new plant vitrification
solution (PVS+), by adding glutathione (GSH) into PVS3. PVS+ rescued the
inefficiency by decreasing ROS accumulation and elevated survival rate of
cryopreserved seeds to 97%. Our results showed some inefficiencies of plant
tissue cryopreservation may be caused by ROS-induced oxidative stress.
Antioxidants can reduce ROS-induced oxidative stress and improve seeds survival
after cryopreservation. In conclusion, N. caerulea seeds were identified as
recalcitrant and successfully cryopreserved. Suppressing ROS accumulation
during cryopreservation may be a potential strategy to improve survival rate of
recalcitrant seeds after cryopreservation.

image-based biometrics. While many generic super-resolution methods have been
proposed to restore low-resolution images, they usually aim to enhance their
visual appearance. However, a visual enhancement of biometric images does not
necessarily correlate with a better recognition performance. Reconstruction
approaches need thus to incorporate specific information from the target
biometric modality to effectively improve recognition. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of iris super-resolution approaches proposed in the
literature. We have also adapted an Eigen-patches reconstruction method based
on PCA Eigen-transformation of local image patches. The structure of the iris
is exploited by building a patch-position dependent dictionary. In addition,
image patches are restored separately, having their own reconstruction weights.
This allows the solution to be locally optimized, helping to preserve local
information. To evaluate the algorithm, we degraded high-resolution images from
the CASIA Interval V3 database. Different restorations were considered, with
15x15 pixels being the smallest resolution. To the best of our knowledge, this
is among the smallest resolutions employed in the literature. The framework is
complemented with six public iris comparators, which were used to carry out
biometric verification and identification experiments. Experimental results
show that the proposed method significantly outperforms both bilinear and
bicubic interpolation at very low-resolution. The performance of a number of
comparators attains an impressive Equal Error Rate as low as 5%, and a Top-1
accuracy of 77-84% when considering iris images of only 15x15 pixels. These
results clearly demonstrate the benefit of using trained super-resolution
techniques to improve the quality of iris images prior to matching.

  Comparison","35 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The generic object detection (GOD) task has been successfully tackled by
recent deep neural networks, trained by an avalanche of annotated training
samples from some common classes. However, it is still non-trivial to
generalize these object detectors to the novel long-tailed object classes,
which have only few labeled training samples. To this end, the Few-Shot Object
Detection (FSOD) has been topical recently, as it mimics the humans' ability of
learning to learn, and intelligently transfers the learned generic object
knowledge from the common heavy-tailed, to the novel long-tailed object
classes. Especially, the research in this emerging field has been flourishing
in recent years with various benchmarks, backbones, and methodologies proposed.
To review these FSOD works, there are several insightful FSOD survey articles
[58, 59, 74, 78] that systematically study and compare them as the groups of
fine-tuning/transfer learning, and meta-learning methods. In contrast, we
review the existing FSOD algorithms from a new perspective under a new taxonomy
based on their contributions, i.e., data-oriented, model-oriented, and
algorithm-oriented. Thus, a comprehensive survey with performance comparison is
conducted on recent achievements of FSOD. Furthermore, we also analyze the
technical challenges, the merits and demerits of these methods, and envision
the future directions of FSOD. Specifically, we give an overview of FSOD,
including the problem definition, common datasets, and evaluation protocols.
The taxonomy is then proposed that groups FSOD methods into three types.
Following this taxonomy, we provide a systematic review of the advances in
FSOD. Finally, further discussions on performance, challenges, and future
directions are presented.

theorem to decompose the gradients of a log posterior density into a mixture of

models, as a mixture of scores can be separately estimated using a score model
and a classifier. However, our analysis indicates that the training objectives
for the classifier in these methods may lead to a serious score mismatch issue,
which corresponds to the situation that the estimated scores deviate from the
true ones. Such an issue causes the samples to be misled by the deviated scores
during the diffusion process, resulting in a degraded sampling quality. To
resolve it, we formulate a novel training objective, called Denoising
Likelihood Score Matching (DLSM) loss, for the classifier to match the
gradients of the true log likelihood density. Our experimental evidence shows
that the proposed method outperforms the previous methods on both Cifar-10 and
Cifar-100 benchmarks noticeably in terms of several key evaluation metrics. We
thus conclude that, by adopting DLSM, the conditional scores can be accurately
modeled, and the effect of the score mismatch issue is alleviated.

  Learning for Online Multi-object Tracking","Accepted by CVPR2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discriminative representation is crucial for the association step in
multi-object tracking. Recent work mainly utilizes features in single or
neighboring frames for constructing metric loss and empowering networks to
extract representation of targets. Although this strategy is effective, it
fails to fully exploit the information contained in a whole trajectory. To this
end, we propose a strategy, namely multi-view trajectory contrastive learning,
in which each trajectory is represented as a center vector. By maintaining all
the vectors in a dynamically updated memory bank, a trajectory-level
contrastive loss is devised to explore the inter-frame information in the whole
trajectories. Besides, in this strategy, each target is represented as multiple
adaptively selected keypoints rather than a pre-defined anchor or center. This
design allows the network to generate richer representation from multiple views
of the same target, which can better characterize occluded objects.
Additionally, in the inference stage, a similarity-guided feature fusion
strategy is developed for further boosting the quality of the trajectory
representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on MOTChallenge to
verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The experimental results
indicate that our method has surpassed preceding trackers and established new
state-of-the-art performance.

significant modulation at intermediate densities, originating in part from the
nontrivial topology of the lowest Landau level, and (2) a region of increasing

Specifically, a tiny regression network is employed to predict the degradation

that has received great attention in the past decade. In this paper, we give
improved streaming algorithms for approximately counting the number of
occurrences of an arbitrary subgraph $H$, denoted $\# H$, when the input graph
$G$ is represented as a stream of $m$ edges. To obtain our algorithms, we
provide a generic transformation that converts constant-round sublinear-time
graph algorithms in the query access model to constant-pass sublinear-space
graph streaming algorithms. Using this transformation, we obtain the following
results. 1. We give a $3$-pass turnstile streaming algorithm for $(1\pm
\epsilon)$-approximating $\# H$ in
$\tilde{O}(\frac{m^{\rho(H)}}{\epsilon^2\cdot \# H})$ space, where $\rho(H)$ is
the fractional edge-cover of $H$. This improves upon and generalizes a result
of McGregor et al. [PODS 2016], who gave a $3$-pass insertion-only streaming
algorithm for $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximating the number $\# T$ of triangles in
$\tilde{O}(\frac{m^{3/2}}{\epsilon^2\cdot \# T})$ space if the algorithm is
given additional oracle access to the degrees. 2. We provide a constant-pass
streaming algorithm for $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximating $\# K_r$ in
$\tilde{O}(\frac{m\lambda^{r-2}}{\epsilon^2\cdot \# K_r})$ space for any $r\geq
3$, in a graph $G$ with degeneracy $\lambda$, where $K_r$ is a clique on $r$
vertices. This resolves a conjecture by Bera and Seshadhri [PODS 2020]. More
generally, our reduction relates the adaptivity of a query algorithm to the
pass complexity of a corresponding streaming algorithm, and it is applicable to
all algorithms in standard sublinear-time graph query models, e.g., the
(augmented) general model.

aiming to generalize the knowledge learned from multiple source domains to an
unseen target domain. The mainstream is to leverage statistical models to model
the dependence between data and labels, intending to learn representations
independent of domain. Nevertheless, the statistical models are superficial
descriptions of reality since they are only required to model dependence
instead of the intrinsic causal mechanism. When the dependence changes with the
target distribution, the statistic models may fail to generalize. In this
regard, we introduce a general structural causal model to formalize the DG
problem. Specifically, we assume that each input is constructed from a mix of
causal factors (whose relationship with the label is invariant across domains)
and non-causal factors (category-independent), and only the former cause the
classification judgments. Our goal is to extract the causal factors from inputs
and then reconstruct the invariant causal mechanisms. However, the theoretical
idea is far from practical of DG since the required causal/non-causal factors
are unobserved. We highlight that ideal causal factors should meet three basic
properties: separated from the non-causal ones, jointly independent, and
causally sufficient for the classification. Based on that, we propose a
Causality Inspired Representation Learning (CIRL) algorithm that enforces the
representations to satisfy the above properties and then uses them to simulate
the causal factors, which yields improved generalization ability. Extensive

propagate at angles depending on the initial condition. The wave amplitudes
increase with time for the hyperbolic system but are stabilized to finite

which aims to assign spatial tasks to mobile workers, has drawn increasing
attention in both academia and industry. One of the major issues is how to best
assign tasks to workers. Given a worker and a task, the worker will choose to
accept the task based on her affinity towards the task, and the worker can
propagate the information of the task to attract more workers to perform it.
These factors can be measured as worker-task influence. Since workers'
affinities towards tasks are different and task issuers may ask workers who
performed tasks to propagate the information of tasks to attract more workers
to perform them, it is important to analyze worker-task influence when making
assignments. We propose and solve a novel influence-aware task assignment
problem in SC, where tasks are assigned to workers in a manner that achieves
high worker-task influence. In particular, we aim to maximize the number of
assigned tasks and worker-task influence. To solve the problem, we first
determine workers' affinities towards tasks by identifying workers' historical
task-performing patterns. Next, a Historical Acceptance approach is developed
to measure workers' willingness of performing a task, i.e., the probability of
workers visiting the location of the task when they are informed. Next, we
propose a Random reverse reachable-based Propagation Optimization algorithm
that exploits reverse reachable sets to calculate the probability of workers
being informed about tasks in a social network. Based on worker-task influence
derived from the above three factors, we propose three influence-aware task
assignment algorithms that aim to maximize the number of assigned tasks and
worker-task influence. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets offer
detailed insight into the effectiveness of our solutions.

fake tweets, annotate a subset of them, and build a classification model for

spontaneous debunking exhibits partisanship in political topics. These results
provide actionable insights into utilizing spontaneous debunking to scale

challenging task with current quantum devices. The implementation of high
fidelity and multi-qubit quantum operations consumes massive resources and
requires complicated hardware design to fight against noise. An approach to
alleviating this problem is to replace quantum operations with classical
processing. Despite the common practice of this approach, rigorous criteria to
determine whether a given quantum operation is replaceable classically are
still missing. In this work, we define the classically replaceable operations
in four general scenarios. In each scenario, we provide their necessary and
sufficient criteria and point out the corresponding classical processing. For a
practically favorable case of unitary classically replaceable operations, we
show that the replaced classical processing is deterministic. Beyond that, we
regard the irreplaceability of quantum operations by classical processing as a
quantum resource and relate it to the performance of a channel in a non-local
game, as manifested in a robustness measure.

exhibit a spatiotemporal self-similar scaling behavior, analogous to the
spatial scaling near phase transitions. The latter arises from the emergent
continuous scaling symmetry due to the divergent correlation length. Motivated
by this, we investigate the relation between the scaling dynamics and
continuous scaling symmetry. We derive a theorem that the scaling invariance of
the quenched Hamiltonian and the initial density matrix can lead to the
universal dynamic scaling in quench dynamics. It is demonstrated both in the
two-body problem analytically and in the many-body problem numerically. For the
latter one, we calculate the dynamics of quantum gases quenched from
noninteracting to finite interaction in the framework of non-equilibrium
high-temperature virial expansion. A dynamic scaling of the momentum
distribution appears in certain momentum-time windows at unitarity as well as
in the weak interacting limit. Remarkably, this universal scaling dynamics
persists approximately with smaller scaling exponents even if the scaling
symmetry is fairly broken. Our findings may offer a new perspective to
interpret the related experiments. We also calculate the Contact dynamics in
the BEC-BCS crossover. Surprisingly, the half-way time displays a maximum near
unitarity while some damping oscillations occur on the BEC side due to the
dimer state, which can be used to detect possible two-body bound states in
experiments.

is known from numerical simulations and satellite observations that the rate is

why Sweet-Parker reconnection is considerably slower. The key consideration of
this analysis is the pressure at the reconnection site (i.e., the x-line). We
show that the Hall electromagnetic fields in antiparallel reconnection cause an
energy void, equivalently a pressure depletion, at the x-line, so the
reconnection exhaust opens out, enabling the fast rate of 0.1. If the energy
can reach the x-line to replenish the pressure, the exhaust does not open out.

separated. However, increasing performance demands and operating in highly
dynamic environments requires an frequent re-evaluation of the planning and
tight integration of control and planning to guarantee safety. We propose an
integrated hierarchical predictive control and planning approach to tackle this
challenge. Planner and controller are based on the repeated solution of moving
horizon optimal control problems. The planner can choose different low-layer
controller modes for increased flexibility and performance instead of using a
single controller with a large safety margin for collision avoidance under
uncertainty. Planning is based on simplified system dynamics and safety, yet
flexible operation is ensured by constraint tightening based on a mixed-integer
linear programming formulation. A cyclic horizon tube-based model predictive
controller guarantees constraint satisfaction for different control modes and
disturbances. Examples of such modes are a slow-speed movement with high
precision and fast-speed movements with large uncertainty bounds. Allowing for
different control modes reduces the conservatism, while the hierarchical
decomposition of the problem reduces the computational cost and enables
real-time implementation. We derive conditions for recursive feasibility to
ensure constraint satisfaction and obstacle avoidance to guarantee safety and
ensure compatibility between the layers and modes. Simulation results
illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed hierarchical
strategy.

promising approach in near-term quantum simulation to achieve practical quantum
advantage over classical computers. Here, we explore variational quantum
algorithms, with different levels of qubit connectivity, for digital simulation

spin squeezed states. We find that as the interaction becomes more long-ranged,
the variational algorithms become less efficient, achieving lower fidelity and
demanding more optimization iterations. In particular, when the system is near
its criticality the efficiency is even lower. Increasing the connectivity
between distant qubits improves the results, even with less quantum and
classical resources. Our results show that by mixing circuit layers with
different levels of connectivity one can sensibly improve the performance.
Interestingly, the order of layers becomes very important and grouping the
layers with long-distance connectivity at the beginning of the circuit
outperforms other permutations. The same design of circuits can also be used to
variationally produce spin squeezed states, as a resource for quantum

We also compared various global (size-mass relation, bulge-to-total luminosity

representation. However, due to the large number of nodes in an AST and the
typically deep AST hierarchy, it is challenging to learn the hierarchical
structure of an AST effectively. In this paper, we propose HELoC, a
hierarchical contrastive learning model for source code representation. To
effectively learn the AST hierarchy, we use contrastive learning to allow the
network to predict the AST node level and learn the hierarchical relationships
between nodes in a self-supervised manner, which makes the representation
vectors of nodes with greater differences in AST levels farther apart in the
embedding space. By using such vectors, the structural similarities between
code snippets can be measured more precisely. In the learning process, a novel
GNN (called Residual Self-attention Graph Neural Network, RSGNN) is designed,
which enables HELoC to focus on embedding the local structure of an AST while
capturing its overall structure. HELoC is self-supervised and can be applied to
many source code related downstream tasks such as code classification, code
clone detection, and code clustering after pre-training. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that HELoC outperforms the state-of-the-art source code

on femtosecond time scales valley coupling is a much more general effect. We
find that two time separated linearly polarized pulses allow almost complete

service in Lombardy. AREU must deal with daily and seasonal variations of call
volume. The number and type of emergency calls changed dramatically during the
COVID-19 pandemic. A model to predict incoming calls and how many of these turn
into events, i.e., dispatch of transport and equipment until the rescue is
completed, was developed to address the emergency period. We used the
generalized additive model with a negative binomial family to predict the
number of events one, two, five, and seven days ahead. The over-dispersion of
the data was tackled by using the negative binomial family and the nonlinear
relationship between the number of events and covariates (e.g., seasonal
effects) by smoothing splines. The model coefficients show the effect of

reasonable mean absolute errors for most of the 2020-2021 period.

pentagonal carbon rings or a hybrid of pentagonal and hexagonal carbon rings.
The resultant nanoribbons are narrow-gap semiconductors and the band edge
states are either spin-degenerate edge states or nonmagnetic bulk states. The
spin is located on the outermost carbon of the pentagonal ring, and the
inter-spin exchange is the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction. For
finite chain lengthes or nonzero magnetization, there are nonzero spin Drude

real-world applications. Since in dynamic scheduling not all information is
available at the start, such problems are usually solved by dispatching rules
(DRs), which create the schedule as the system executes. Recently, DRs have
been successfully developed using genetic programming. However, a single DR may
not efficiently solve different problem instances. Therefore, much research has
focused on using DRs collaboratively by forming ensembles. In this paper, a
novel ensemble collaboration method for dynamic scheduling is proposed. In this
method, DRs are applied independently at each decision point to create a
simulation of the schedule for all currently released jobs. Based on these
simulations, it is determined which DR makes the best decision and that
decision is applied. The results show that the ensembles easily outperform
individual DRs for different ensemble sizes. Moreover, the results suggest that

quantum systems has not been given much attention with a reason being their
non-unitary dynamics not natural to simulate on a set of unitary gate
operations in quantum computing. Here we study prototypical models in open
quantum systems with Trotterisations for the modified stochastic
Schr{\""o}dinger equation (MSSE). Minimising the leading error in MSSE enables
to optimise the quantum circuits, and we run the optimised circuits with the
noiseless \textit{quantum assembly language (QASM) simulator} and the noisy IBM
Quantum devices. The \textit{QASM simulator} enables to study the reachable
system size that is comparable to the limits of classical computers. The
results show that the nonequilibrium critical phenomena in open quantum systems
are successfully obtained with high precision. Furthermore, we run the
algorithm on the IBM Quantum devices, showing that the current machine is
challenging, to give quantitatively accurate time dynamics due to the noise.
Despite errors, the results by IBM devices qualitatively follow the trend of
critical behaviour and include a possibility to demonstrate quantum advantage
when the noise is reduced. We discuss how much noise should be reduced for a
certain fidelity using the noise model, which will be crucial to demonstrate
quantum advantage from future quantum devices.

million people suffer from strokes annually, of which almost 70% die or are
permanently disabled. Effective treatment must be administered within one hour
to prevent irreversible brain damage. Unfortunately, the current gold standards
for diagnosis, CT and MRI, are time-consuming, expensive, and immobile.
Electroencephalograms reveal biomarkers of strokes while being inexpensive and
available for remote use, but no system exists that utilizes them for this
purpose. To address this issue, we created StrokeSight, a novel, open-source
web application that automatically provides a full diagnosis and visualization
of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in under 50 seconds using 60-second
electroencephalograms. We first calculated the averaged power spectral
densities for 132, 60-second electroencephalogram readings, which we then used
to train three deep neural networks that respectively predict a stroke type
(control/ischemic/hemorrhagic), location (left/right hemisphere), and severity
(small/large) with accuracies of 97.5%, 94.4%, and 100%. StrokeSight also
implements a novel process to visualize spectral abnormalities caused by
strokes. Azimuthal equidistant projection and multivariate spline interpolation
are used to reshape 3D electrodes onto a head-shaped 2D plane and then a
contour map of each frequency band power is created, allowing neurologists to
quickly and accurately interpret electroencephalogram data. StrokeSight could
act as a revolutionary solution for stroke care that drastically improves the

the low-resolution source. With the decision to employ the source as a
constraint rather than only as an input to the prediction, our method differs

  inference of Latent Gaussian Models using R-INLA","22 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Various computational challenges arise when applying Bayesian inference
approaches to complex hierarchical models. Sampling-based inference methods,
such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo strategies, are renowned for providing
accurate results but with high computational costs and slow or questionable
convergence. On the contrary, approximate methods like the Integrated Nested
Laplace Approximation (INLA) construct a deterministic approximation to the
univariate posteriors through nested Laplace Approximations. This method
enables fast inference performance in Latent Gaussian Models, which encode a
large class of hierarchical models. R-INLA software mainly consists of three
strategies to compute all the required posterior approximations depending on
the accuracy requirements. The Simplified Laplace approximation (SLA) is the
most attractive because of its speed performance since it is based on a Taylor
expansion up to order three of a full Laplace Approximation. Here we enhance
the methodology by simplifying the computations necessary for the skewness and
modal configuration. Then we propose an expansion up to order four and use the
Extended Skew Normal distribution as a new parametric fit. The resulting
approximations to the marginal posterior densities are more accurate than those
calculated with the SLA, with essentially no additional cost.

human-annotated identities and train the model with only bounding box

detection and unsupervised re-identification (Re-ID) steps. However, in this
way, two important clues in unconstrained scene images are ignored. On the one
hand, existing unsupervised Re-ID models only leverage cropped images from
scene images but ignore its rich context information. On the other hand, there
are numerous unpaired persons in real-world scene images. Directly dealing with
them as independent identities leads to the long-tail effect, while completely

using a few labelled examples of classes not seen during initial training. In
this paper, we present a simple but effective temporal transductive inference
(TTI) approach that leverages temporal consistency in the unlabelled video
frames during few-shot inference. Key to our approach is the use of both global
and local temporal constraints. The objective of the global constraint is to
learn consistent linear classifiers for novel classes across the image
sequence, whereas the local constraint enforces the proportion of
foreground/background regions in each frame to be coherent across a local
temporal window. These constraints act as spatiotemporal regularizers during
the transductive inference to increase temporal coherence and reduce
overfitting on the few-shot support set. Empirically, our model outperforms
state-of-the-art meta-learning approaches in terms of mean intersection over

that are exhaustively labelled (i.e. all object occurrences are labelled,
unlike the currently available), and present a more realistic evaluation
paradigm that targets data distribution shift between training and testing
sets. Our empirical results and in-depth analysis confirm the added benefits of
the proposed spatiotemporal regularizers to improve temporal coherence and
overcome certain overfitting scenarios.

Rindler spacetime, and then specialize to the black hole case. The physics
depends strongly on the distance of the box from the horizon, which we treat as

lowered towards the black hole, and that the pressure is highly anisotropic.
The pressure difference between the upper and lower wall leads to an effective

  Recognition","CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) plays a critical role in securing face recognition
systems from different presentation attacks. Previous works leverage auxiliary
pixel-level supervision and domain generalization approaches to address unseen
spoof types. However, the local characteristics of image captures, i.e.,
capturing devices and presenting materials, are ignored in existing works and
we argue that such information is required for networks to discriminate between
live and spoof images. In this work, we propose PatchNet which reformulates
face anti-spoofing as a fine-grained patch-type recognition problem. To be
specific, our framework recognizes the combination of capturing devices and
presenting materials based on the patches cropped from non-distorted face
images. This reformulation can largely improve the data variation and enforce
the network to learn discriminative feature from local capture patterns. In
addition, to further improve the generalization ability of the spoof feature,
we propose the novel Asymmetric Margin-based Classification Loss and
Self-supervised Similarity Loss to regularize the patch embedding space. Our
experimental results verify our assumption and show that the model is capable
of recognizing unseen spoof types robustly by only looking at local regions.
Moreover, the fine-grained and patch-level reformulation of FAS outperforms the
existing approaches on intra-dataset, cross-dataset, and domain generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, our PatchNet framework can enable practical
applications like Few-Shot Reference-based FAS and facilitate future
exploration of spoof-related intrinsic cues.

getting optimal performance by training local-adapted models automatically and
un-supervisely, as opposed to fixing their initial global model. We achieve
this by a newly proposed embedding cluster model based on Graph Convolution

previous works, our meta-clustering model can generalize well in unseen local
environments. With the pseudo identity labels from the clustering results, we
further introduce novel regularization techniques to improve the model

weights affects a neural network's neural tangent kernel (NTK). In particular,
this work establishes an equivalence of the NTKs between a fully-connected
neural network and its randomly pruned version. The equivalence is established
under two cases. The first main result studies the infinite-width asymptotic.
It is shown that given a pruning probability, for fully-connected neural
networks with the weights randomly pruned at the initialization, as the width
of each layer grows to infinity sequentially, the NTK of the pruned neural
network converges to the limiting NTK of the original network with some extra
scaling. If the network weights are rescaled appropriately after pruning, this
extra scaling can be removed. The second main result considers the finite-width
case. It is shown that to ensure the NTK's closeness to the limit, the
dependence of width on the sparsity parameter is asymptotically linear, as the
NTK's gap to its limit goes down to zero. Moreover, if the pruning probability
is set to zero (i.e., no pruning), the bound on the required width matches the
bound for fully-connected neural networks in previous works up to logarithmic
factors. The proof of this result requires developing a novel analysis of a
network structure which we called \textit{mask-induced pseudo-networks}.

are manifestations of the memory effect. There is nothing singular about states
with memory, but they do not lie in the standard Fock space. IR divergences are
artifacts of trying to represent states with memory in the standard Fock space.
For collider physics, one can impose an IR cutoff and calculate inclusive
quantities. But, this approach cannot treat memory as a quantum observable and
is highly unsatisfactory if one views the S-matrix as fundamental in QFT and
quantum gravity, since the S-matrix is undefined. For a well-defined S-matrix,
it is necessary to define in/out Hilbert spaces with memory. Such a
construction was given by Faddeev and Kulish (FK) for QED. Their construction
""dresses"" momentum states of the charged particles by pairing them with memory
states of the electromagnetic field to produce states of vanishing large gauge
charges at spatial infinity. However, in massless QED, due to collinear
divergences, the ""dressing"" has an infinite energy flux so these states are
unphysical. In Yang-Mills theory the ""soft particles"" used for dressing also
contribute to the current flux, invalidating the FK procedure. In quantum
gravity, the analogous FK construction would attempt to produce a Hilbert space
of eigenstates of supertranslation charges at spatial infinity. However, we
prove that there are no eigenstates of supertranslation charges except the
vacuum. Thus, the FK construction fails in quantum gravity. We investigate some
alternatives to FK constructions but find that these also do not work. We
believe that to treat scattering at a fundamental level in quantum gravity - as
well as in massless QED and YM theory - it is necessary to take an algebraic
viewpoint rather than shoehorn the in/out states into some fixed Hilbert space.
We outline the framework of such an IR finite scattering theory.

hierarchical semantic segmentation (HSS), which aims at structured, pixel-wise

HSSN, a general HSS framework that tackles two critical issues in this task: i)
how to efficiently adapt existing hierarchy-agnostic segmentation networks to
the HSS setting, and ii) how to leverage the hierarchy information to
regularize HSS network learning. To address i), HSSN directly casts HSS as a
pixel-wise multi-label classification task, only bringing minimal architecture
change to current segmentation models. To solve ii), HSSN first explores
inherent properties of the hierarchy as a training objective, which enforces
segmentation predictions to obey the hierarchy structure. Further, with
hierarchy-induced margin constraints, HSSN reshapes the pixel embedding space,
so as to generate well-structured pixel representations and improve
segmentation eventually. We conduct experiments on four semantic segmentation

information for the same task, considering not only the mmW face, but also mmW
torso and mmW wholebody. We report experimental results using the mmW TNO
database consisting of 50 individuals based on both hand-crafted and learned
features from Alexnet and VGG-face pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) models. First, we analyze the individual performance of three mmW body
parts, concluding that: i) mmW torso region is more discriminative than mmW
face and the whole body, ii) CNN features produce better results compared to
hand-crafted features on mmW faces and the entire body, and iii) hand-crafted
features slightly outperform CNN features on mmW torso. In the second part of
this work, we analyze different multi-algorithmic and multi-modal techniques,
including a novel CNN-based fusion technique, improving verification results to
2% EER and identification rank-1 results up to 99%. Comparative analyses with
mmW body shape information and face recognition in the visible and NIR spectral
bands are also reported.

coherent-elastic-neutrino-nucleus-scattering (CENNS) searches confront similar
challenges in choosing ultra-low threshold and large-mass detectors. We report
experimental results from the first-of-its-kind 100 g single-crystal sapphire
detector design with a diameter of 76 mm and thickness of 4 mm. The detector is
designed to be sensitive for low-energy rare interactions with an intention to
investigate the low mass region of dark matter phase-space and search for CENNS
at the reactor site. Sapphire is a crystal of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and has
been found to be a good candidate for light mass spin-dependent dark matter
search experiments due to its lower atomic mass compared to other detector
materials such as germanium and silicon. Using the data collected from the test
facility at Texas A&M University, we were able to resolve low energy lines from
calibration sources and estimated that our newly developed sapphire detector
has a baseline recoil energy resolution of 18 eV. These detectors are operated
at 0 V with the phonon-assisted detection providing a quenching-free
low-threshold operation.

Oblate Spheroidal coordinates, and vice versa, is derived. It can help to
transform vector fields between these two types of orthogonal coordinates which
can advantageously simplify solutions of problems exhibiting oblate spheroidal
geometry. Several examples demonstrate the use of the derived relations.
Generalized sine and cosine applicable in Similar Oblate Spheroidal coordinate
system are introduced.

Computational resolution of this challenge is possible through Natural Language
Processing techniques. Statistical techniques like machine learning and deep
learning require a lot of data to train and despite that they fail to tap into
the nuances of language. Such systems usually perform best on close-domain
datasets. We have proposed development of a rule-based open-domain
question-answering system which is capable of answering questions of any domain
from a corresponding context passage. We have used 1000 questions from SQuAD
2.0 dataset for testing the developed system and it gives satisfactory results.
In this paper, we have described the structure of the developed system and have
analyzed the performance.
