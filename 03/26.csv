reconstruction and segmentation of real-time phase contrast MR (PCMR), which
has previously been difficult to perform. Here we propose a deep learning
framework for 'Flow Reconstruction and Segmentation for low latency Cardiac
Output monitoring' (FReSCO).
  Methods: Deep artifact suppression and segmentation U-Nets were independently
trained. Breath hold spiral PCMR data (n=516) was synthetically undersampled
using a variable density spiral sampling pattern and gridded to create aliased
data for training of the artifact suppression U-net. A subset of the data
(n=96) was segmented and used to train the segmentation U-net. Real-time spiral
PCMR was prospectively acquired and then reconstructed and segmented using the
trained models (FReSCO) at low latency at the scanner in 10 healthy subjects
during rest, exercise and recovery periods. CO obtained via FReSCO was compared
to a reference rest CO and rest and exercise Compressed Sensing (CS) CO.
  Results: FReSCO was demonstrated prospectively at the scanner. Beat-to-beat
heartrate, stroke volume and CO could be visualized with a mean latency of
622ms. No significant differences were noted when compared to reference at rest
(Bias = -0.21+-0.50 L/min, p=0.246) or CS at peak exercise (Bias=0.12+-0.48
L/min, p=0.458).
  Conclusion: FReSCO was successfully demonstrated for real-time monitoring of
CO during exercise and could provide a convenient tool for assessment of the
hemodynamic response to a range of stressors.

minimizes the energy functional separately with respect to displacement and the
phase-field, in an additive and multiplicative manner. In contrast to the
standard alternate minimization, the result of this decoupled minimization
process is used to construct a preconditioner for a coupled linear system,
arising at each Newton's iteration. The overall performance and the convergence

These techniques work by evaluating many smaller circuits on the smaller

particular, when focusing on the minimum-variance portfolio, the covariance
matrix or better its inverse, the so-called precision matrix, is the only input
required. So far, most scholars worked on improving the estimation of the
input, however little attention has been given to the limitations of the
inverse covariance matrix when capturing the dependence structure in a
non-Gaussian setting. While the precision matrix allows to correctly understand
the conditional dependence structure of random vectors in a Gaussian setting,
the inverse of the covariance matrix might not necessarily result in a reliable
source of information when Gaussianity fails. In this paper, exploiting the
local dependence function, different definitions of the generalized precision
matrix (GPM), which holds for a general class of distributions, are provided.
In particular, we focus on the multivariate t-Student distribution and point
out that the interaction in random vectors does not depend only on the inverse
of the covariance matrix, but also on additional elements. We test the
performance of the proposed GPM using a minimum-variance portfolio set-up by
considering S\&P 100 and Fama and French industry data. We show that portfolios
relying on the GPM often generate statistically significant lower out-of-sample

proposed and well developed. Firstly, a freely floating flexible structure is
discretized into several macro-submodules in two horizontal directions to
perform a multi-rigid-body hydrodynamic analysis. Each macro-submodule is then
abstracted to a lumped mass at the center of gravity that bears the external
forces including inertia force, hydrodynamic force and hydrostatic force. Apart
from external forces, all lumped masses are also subjected to structural forces
that reflect the structural deformation features of the original flexible
structure. The key to calculating the structural forces is derivation of the
equivalent overall structural stiffness matrix with respect to the
displacements of all lumped masses, which is tackled following the finite
element procedure. More specifically, each macro-submodule is discretized into
a number of microelements to derive the corresponding structural stiffness
matrix, which is manipulated to a new one including only the nodes at the
position of the lumped masses and surrounding boundaries by using the
substructure approach, and subsequently the target overall stiffness matrix is
obtained by combining together all macro-submodules. Finally, based on
equivalence between external and structural forces, the DMFE method establishes
the hydroelastic equation on all lumped masses with their displacements as
unknown variables. Solving the equation gives the displacement response of all
lumped masses. Displacement and structural force responses are first calculated
on the interfaces of every two adjacent macro-submodules, after which at any
given position of the flexible structure, the recovery of displacement is based
on the structural stiffness matrix of the corresponding macro-submodule and the
recovery of structural force uses the spline interpolation scheme.

cosmological observations. We review here some aspects of this fundamental
theoretical conundrum (`the cosmological constant problem') and strongly argue
in favor of the possibility that the cosmic vacuum density $\rho_{\rm vac}$ may
be mildly evolving with the expansion rate $H$. Such a `running vacuum model'
(RVM) proposal predicts an effective dynamical dark energy without postulating
new ad hoc fields (quintessence and the like). Using the method of adiabatic
renormalization within QFT in curved spacetime we find that $\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$
acquires a dynamical component ${\cal O}(H^2)$ caused by the quantum matter
effects. There are also ${\cal O}(H^n)$ ($n=4,6,..$) contributions, some of
which may trigger inflation in the early universe. Remarkably, the evolution of
the adiabatically renormalized $\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ is not affected by dangerous
terms proportional to the quartic power of the masses ($\sim m^4$) of the
fields. Traditionally, these terms have been the main source of trouble as they
are responsible for the extreme fine tuning feature of the cosmological
constant problem. In the context under study, however, the late time $\rho_{\rm
vac}(H)$ around $H_0$ is given by a dominant term ($\rho_{\rm vac}^0$) plus the
aforementioned mild dynamical component $\propto \nu (H^2-H_0^2)$ (with
$|\nu|\ll1$), which makes the RVM to mimic quintessence. Finally, on the
phenomenological side we show that the RVM may be instrumental in alleviating
some of the most challenging problems (so-called `tensions') afflicting
nowadays the observational consistency of the `concordance' $\Lambda$CDM model,
such as the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions.

probing up to ~150 kpc in projection. Our results significantly improve

multiple images and measurements of the spatially-resolved stellar kinematics
of the BGG, we conduct a detailed analysis of the multi-scale mass distribution
using various modeling approaches, both in the single and multiple lens-plane
scenarios. Our best-fit mass models reproduce the positions of multiple images
and provide robust reconstructions for two background galaxies at z = 1.4869

remarkably consistent in our three reference models, demonstrating the
self-consistency between strong lensing analyses based on image position and

projected total mass profiles within 20 kpc, while the group-scale halo
dominates at larger radii. The total projected mass enclosed within $R_{eff}$ =
27.2 kpc is $1.10_{-0.04}^{+0.02} \times 10^{13}$ M$_\odot$. We find that CSWA
31 is a peculiar fossil group, strongly dark-matter dominated towards the

cluster-scale halos. The total mass-density slope within the effective radius
is shallower than isothermal, consistent with previous analyses of early-type

optimization of preexisting and novel CFD models. In this work, we propose
JAX-FLUIDS: a comprehensive fully-differentiable CFD Python solver for

enables end-to-end optimization. I.e., ML models can be optimized with
gradients that are backpropagated through the entire CFD algorithm, and
therefore contain not only information of the underlying PDE but also of the

portfolio management is unable to provide additional risk-adjusted returns
relative to their benchmarks. For this reason, passive wealth management has
emerged in recent decades to offer returns close to benchmarks at a lower cost.
In this article, we first refine the existing results on the theoretical
properties of oblique Brownian motion. Then, assuming that the returns follow
skew geometric Brownian motions and that they are correlated, we describe some
statistical properties for the \emph{ex-post}, the \emph{ex-ante} tracking
errors, and the forecasted tracking portfolio. To this end, we develop an
innovative statistical methodology, based on a benchmark-asset principal
component factorization, to determine a tracking portfolio that replicates the
performance of a benchmark by investing in a subset of the investable universe.
This strategy, named hybrid Principal Component Analysis (hPCA), is applied
both on normal and skew distributions. In the case of skew-normal returns, we
propose a framework for calibrating the model parameters, based on the maximum
likelihood estimation method. For testing and validation, we compare four
alternative models for index tracking. The first two are based on the hPCA when
returns are assumed to be normal or skew-normal. The third model adopts a
standard optimization-based approach and the last one is used in the financial
sector by some practitioners. For validation and testing, we present a thorough
comparison of these strategies on real-world data, both in terms of performance

suggested lean PCA-based portfolio selection approach compares well versus
cumbersome algorithms for optimization-based portfolios, but, also, it could

is possible, albeit it manifests differently from topic to topic. Moreover, we
observe that filter bubbles do not truly appear in some situations. We also
draw a direct comparison with a previous study. Sadly, we did not find much
improvements in misinformation occurrences, despite recent pledges by YouTube.

experimental realisations of t-designs are subject to noise. Here we
investigate the effect of noise channels on the quality of single-qubit
t-designs. The noise channels we study are bit flips, phase flips, bit and
phase flips, phase damping, amplitude damping and depolarising noise. We
consider two noise models: the first has noise applied before the t-design
unitary operations, while the second has noise applied after the unitary
operations. We show that for single qubits the 1-design is completely
unaffected by an arbitrary noise channel, for both noise models, while numeric
results obtained for the 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-design suggest that a 2t-design is
significantly more sensitive to noise than a (2t-1)-design and that, with the
exception of amplitude damping, a (2t+1)-design is as sensitive to noise as a
2t-design. Numeric results also reveal substantial variations in sensitivity to
noise throughout the Bloch sphere. In particular, t-designs appear to be most
sensitive to noise when acting on pure states and least sensitive to noise for
the maximally mixed state. For depolarising noise, we show that our two noise
models are equivalent, and for the other noise channels, numeric results
suggest that applying a noise channel after the unitary operations effectively
transforms the channel into a depolarising channel, an effect exploited in
randomised benchmarking with 2-designs.

to provide charged-particle identification in the 2-20 GeV$/c$ momentum range.
Prompt Cherenkov photons emitted by charged hadrons as they traverse a 10mm
quartz radiator are propagated to the periphery of the detector, where they are
focused onto an array of micro-channel plate photomultiplier tubes (MCP-PMTs).
The position and arrival times of the photons are used to infer the particles'
time of entry in the radiator, to identify hadrons based on their ToF. The
MCP-PMTs were developed with an industrial partner to satisfy the stringent
requirements of the TORCH detector. The requirements include a finely segmented
anode, excellent time resolution, and a long lifetime. Over an approximately
10m flight distance, the difference in ToF between a kaon and a pion with
10GeV$/c$ momentum is 35ps, leading to a 10-15ps per track timing resolution
requirement. On average 30 photons per hadron are detected, which translates to
a single-photon time resolution of 70ps. The TORCH research and development
program aims to demonstrate the validity of the detector concept through
laboratory and beam tests, results from which are presented. A timing
resolution of 70-100ps was reached in beam tests, approaching the TORCH design
goal. Laboratory timing tests consist of operating the MCP-PMTs coupled to the
TORCH readout electronics. A time resolution of about 50ps was measured,
meeting the TORCH target timing resolution.

paper, we present a new framework to formulate the trajectory prediction task
as a reverse process of motion indeterminacy diffusion (MID), in which we
progressively discard indeterminacy from all the walkable areas until reaching
the desired trajectory. This process is learned with a parameterized Markov
chain conditioned by the observed trajectories. We can adjust the length of the
chain to control the degree of indeterminacy and balance the diversity and
determinacy of the predictions. Specifically, we encode the history behavior
information and the social interactions as a state embedding and devise a
Transformer-based diffusion model to capture the temporal dependencies of
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the human trajectory prediction
benchmarks including the Stanford Drone and ETH/UCY datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method. Code is available at

low-dimensional adversarial perturbations (LDAPs) in classification. Unlike the
classical setting, these perturbations are limited to a subspace of dimension
$k$ which is much smaller than the dimension $d$ of the feature space. The case
$k=1$ corresponds to so-called universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs;
Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2017). First, we consider binary classifiers under
generic regularity conditions (including ReLU networks) and compute analytical
lower-bounds for the fooling rate of any subspace. These bounds explicitly
highlight the dependence of the fooling rate on the pointwise margin of the
model (i.e., the ratio of the output to its $L_2$ norm of its gradient at a
test point), and on the alignment of the given subspace with the gradients of
the model w.r.t. inputs. Our results provide a rigorous explanation for the
recent success of heuristic methods for efficiently generating low-dimensional
adversarial perturbations. Finally, we show that if a decision-region is
compact, then it admits a universal adversarial perturbation with $L_2$ norm
which is $\sqrt{d}$ times smaller than the typical $L_2$ norm of a data point.

approaches have emerged to address the annotation problem: mapping candidate
molecules to spectra, and mapping query spectra to molecular candidates. In
essence, the candidate molecule with the spectrum that best explains the query
spectrum is recommended as the target molecule. Despite candidate ranking being
fundamental in both approaches, no prior works utilized rank learning tasks in
determining the target molecule. We propose a novel machine learning model,
Ensemble Spectral Prediction (ESP), for metabolite annotation. ESP takes
advantage of prior neural network-based annotation models that utilize
multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Based on
the ranking results of the MLP and GNN-based models, ESP learns a weighting for
the outputs of MLP and GNN spectral predictors to generate a spectral
prediction for a query molecule. Importantly, training data is stratified by
molecular formula to provide candidate sets during model training. Further,
baseline MLP and GNN models are enhanced by considering peak dependencies
through multi-head attention mechanism and multi-tasking on spectral topic
distributions. ESP improves average rank by 41% and 30% over the MLP and GNN
baselines, respectively, demonstrating remarkable performance gain over
state-of-the-art neural network approaches. We show that annotation
performance, for ESP and other models, is a strong function of the number of
molecules in the candidate set and their similarity to the target molecule.

that inequalities also appear proportional to growth processes in these cities.
Then, assessing spatial inequalities among the socioeconomically clustered

populations who have a larger share of minorities, earn less, and have a

in the production mechanism provide a source of isospin violation because they
do not cancel by the different mass of the charged and neutral kaons. We obtain
a branching ratio for $a_0(980)$ production of the order of $5 \times 10^{-6}$.
Future experiments can address this problem and the production rate and shape
of the $\pi^0 \eta$ mass distribution will definitely help to better understand
the nature of scalar resonances.

In this work, we propose a framework for real-time safe and thorough evaluation

photo-realistic virtual environments. We propose to use the Unreal graphics
engine coupled with the AirSim plugin for drone's simulation, and evaluate
autonomous landing strategies based on visual detection of Safe Landing Zones

selecting the ""best"" SLZ, and evaluate them during autonomous landing of a
virtual drone in different scenarios and conditions, under different

different metrics to quantify the performance of the landing strategies,
establishing a baseline for comparison with future works in this challenging

The study suggests that the use of the autonomous landing algorithms
considerably helps to prevent accidents involving humans, which may allow to
unleash the full potential of drones in urban environments near to people.

the near infrared region. Moreover, metallic TMDs show potential for combined
plasmonic-dielectric behavior and hyperbolicity, as their plasma frequency
occurs at around $\sim$1000--1300 nm depending on the material. The knowledge

Despite CAR advances, stratified randomization remains the most common CAR

optimally identified matched pairs based on covariates and a distance matrix.
When participants enroll sequentially, Sequentially Matched Randomization (SMR)
randomizes within matches found ""on-the-fly"" to meet a pre-specified matching
threshold. However, pre-specifying the ideal threshold can be challenging and
SMR yields less-optimal matches than MR. We extend SMR to allow multiple
participants to be randomized simultaneously, to allow matches to break and
rematch if a better match later enrolls (Sequential Rematched Randomization;
SRR), and to use a dynamic threshold. In simplified settings and a real-world
application, we assess whether these extensions improve covariate balance,
estimator/study efficiency, and optimality of matches. We investigate whether
adjusting for more covariates can be detrimental upon covariate balance and
efficiency as is the case of traditional stratified randomization. As secondary
objectives, we use the case study to assess how SMR schemes compare
side-by-side with common and related CAR schemes and whether adjusting for
covariates in the design can be as powerful as adjusting for covariates in a
parametric model. We find each SMR extension, individually and collectively, to
improve covariate balance, estimator efficiency, study power, and quality of

short sequences. As sequence length grows, though, it becomes more difficult to
regularize, and it becomes less feasible to learn only through regularization.
We propose a new architecture for function reconstruction based on classical
Bezier splines, which ensures $C^0$ and $C^1$-continuity, where $C^0$
continuity is that $\forall c:\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x)

attention from both academic and industrial communities due to its flexible
application scenarios. However, the dependence on a pretty large VGG-based
autoencoder leads to existing style transfer models having high parameter
complexities, which limits their applications on resource-constrained devices.
Compared with many other tasks, the compression of style transfer models has
been less explored. Recently, the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) has shown
great potential in finding extremely sparse matching subnetworks which can
achieve on par or even better performance than the original full networks when
trained in isolation. In this work, we for the first time perform an empirical
study to verify whether such trainable matching subnetworks also exist in style
transfer models. Specifically, we take two most popular style transfer models,
i.e., AdaIN and SANet, as the main testbeds, which represent global and local
transformation based style transfer methods respectively. We carry out
extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis, and draw the following
conclusions. (1) Compared with fixing the VGG encoder, style transfer models
can benefit more from training the whole network together. (2) Using iterative
magnitude pruning, we find the matching subnetworks at 89.2% sparsity in AdaIN
and 73.7% sparsity in SANet, which demonstrates that style transfer models can
play lottery tickets too. (3) The feature transformation module should also be
pruned to obtain a much sparser model without affecting the existence and
quality of the matching subnetworks. (4) Besides AdaIN and SANet, other models
such as LST, MANet, AdaAttN and MCCNet can also play lottery tickets, which
shows that LTH can be generalized to various style transfer models.

Our main result says that that the boundary of the effective front is

associated with a continuous $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic Riemannian metric is
differentiable at irrational points. This conclusion was obtained decades ago
for smooth metrics ([3,5]). To the best of our knowledge, our result provides
the first nontrivial property of the effective fronts in the continuous

inversion of the image understanding process. Since generic image understanding
involves solving multiple tasks, it is natural to aim at generating images via
multi-conditioning. However, multi-conditional image generation is a very
challenging problem due to the heterogeneity and the sparsity of the (in
practice) available conditioning labels. In this work, we propose a novel
neural architecture to address the problem of heterogeneity and sparsity of the
spatially multi-conditional labels. Our choice of spatial conditioning, such as
by semantics and depth, is driven by the promise it holds for better control of
the image generation process. The proposed method uses a transformer-like
architecture operating pixel-wise, which receives the available labels as input
tokens to merge them in a learned homogeneous space of labels. The merged
labels are then used for image generation via conditional generative
adversarial training. In this process, the sparsity of the labels is handled by
simply dropping the input tokens corresponding to the missing labels at the
desired locations, thanks to the proposed pixel-wise operating architecture.

hierarchically learning a modal-invariant latent space featured with continuous

HCMoCo provides pre-train for different modalities by combining heterogeneous

Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks of different modalities
demonstrate the effectiveness of HCMoCo, especially under data-efficient
settings (7.16% and 12% improvement on DensePose Estimation and Human Parsing).
Moreover, we demonstrate the versatility of HCMoCo by exploring cross-modality

(BEC) have been demonstrated at room-temperature in several perovskite
formulations. Thermodynamically, low-threshold BEC requires efficient
scattering to $k_{||}$ = 0, and many applications demand precise control of
polariton interactions. Thus far, the primary mechanisms by which polaritons
relax in perovskites remains unclear. In this work, we perform
temperature-dependent measurements of polaritons in low-dimensional hybrid
perovskites with high light-matter coupling strengths ($\hbar \Omega_{Rabi}$ =
260$\pm$5 meV). By embedding the perovskite active layer in a wedged cavity, we
are able to tune the Hopfield coefficients and decouple the primary polariton
relaxation mechanisms in this material for the first time. We observe the
thermal activation of a bottleneck regime, and reveal that this effect can be
overcome by harnessing intrinsic scattering mechanisms arising from the
interplay between the different excitonic species, such as biexciton-assisted
polariton relaxation pathways, and isoenergetic intracavity pumping. We
demonstrate the dependence of the bottleneck suppression on cavity detuning,
and are able to achieve efficient relaxation to $k_{||}$ = 0 even at cryogenic

ultra-low-threshold BEC and condensate control by engineering polariton
dispersions resonant with efficient relaxation pathways, leveraging intrinsic
material scattering mechanisms for next-generation polariton optoelectronics.

articulated observer points, which relate implicit states to the explicit

assessment. Here we show, using a traditional Koppen-Geiger bioclimate
classification system, that the latest CMIP6 Earth System Models actually agree
very well on the fraction of the global land-surface that will undergo a
significant change per degree of global warming. Data from historical and
ssp585 model runs are used to create bioclimate maps at various degrees of
global warming, and to investigate the performance of the ensemble mean when
classifying climate data into discrete categories. Using a streamlined scheme
with 13 classifications, global bioclimate classification maps at 2K and 4K of
global warming above a 1901-1931 reference period are presented. These
projections show large shifts in bioclimate distribution, with an almost
exclusive change from colder, wetter bioclimates to hotter, dryer ones.
Historical model run performance is assessed and examined by comparison with
the bioclimatic classifications derived from the observed climate over the same
time period. The fraction of the land experiencing a change in its bioclimatic
class as a function of global warming is estimated by combining the results
from the individual models. Despite the discrete nature of the bioclimatic
classification scheme, we find only a weakly-saturating dependence of this
fraction on global warming which implies about 12 pct of land experiencing a
significant change in climate, per 1K increase in global mean temperature
between the global warming levels of 1 and 3K. Therefore, we estimate that
stabilising the climate at 1.5K rather than 2K of global warming, would save
over 7 million square kilometres of land from a major bioclimatic change.

makes their use problematic in safety-critical applications. State-of-the-art (
SOTA ) calibration techniques improve on the confidence of predicted labels
alone and leave the confidence of non-max classes (e.g. top-2, top-5)
uncalibrated. Such calibration is not suitable for label refinement using
post-processing. Further, most SOTA techniques learn a few hyper-parameters
post-hoc, leaving out the scope for image, or pixel specific calibration. This
makes them unsuitable for calibration under domain shift, or for dense
prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, we argue for
intervening at the train time itself, so as to directly produce calibrated DNN
models. We propose a novel auxiliary loss function: Multi-class Difference in
Confidence and Accuracy ( MDCA ), to achieve the same MDCA can be used in
conjunction with other application/task-specific loss functions. We show that
training with MDCA leads to better-calibrated models in terms of Expected
Calibration Error ( ECE ), and Static Calibration Error ( SCE ) on image
classification, and segmentation tasks. We report ECE ( SCE ) score of 0.72
(1.60) on the CIFAR 100 dataset, in comparison to 1.90 (1.71) by the SOTA.
Under domain shift, a ResNet-18 model trained on PACS dataset using MDCA gives
an average ECE ( SCE ) score of 19.7 (9.7) across all domains, compared to 24.2
(11.8) by the SOTA. For the segmentation task, we report a 2X reduction in
calibration error on PASCAL - VOC dataset in comparison to Focal Loss. Finally,
MDCA training improves calibration even on imbalanced data, and for natural

when kinks of the topological sector of the scalar field are interacting with

substantial work put into such a discovery, doing so in the case of large noise

Identification and Denoising of a Dynamical System (SIDDS). We infer the noise
in the state measurements by requiring that the denoised data satisfies the
dynamical system with an equality constraint. This is unlike existing work
where the mismatch in the dynamical system is treated as a penalty in the

develop a sequential quadratic programming approach to solve the SIDDS problem
featuring a direct solution of KKT system with a specialized preconditioner. In
addition, we show how we can include sparsity promoting regularization using an
iteratively reweighted least squares approach. The resulting algorithm leads to
estimates of the dynamical system that approximately achieve the Cram\'er-Rao
lower bound and, with sparsity promotion, can correctly identify the sparsity
structure for higher levels of noise than existing techniques. Moreover,
because SIDDS decouples the data from the evolution of the dynamical system, we
show how to modify the problem to accurately identify systems from low sample

SIDDS has the potential to be expanded to related problems identifying
governing equations from noisy data.

how well they perform in the learned task. We hypothesize that task performance
can give an indication of the generalization performance on similar tasks. The
proposed approach is validated in a user study (N = 27). Users with different

(pressing a button) under different task constraints. They taught the robot in
two sessions on two different days to capture their teaching behaviour across

in emergent intersubband polaritonic responses in optical conductivity. In our
proposed system, hBN-encapsulated graphene is placed on top of a 1D periodic
metagate. In addition, a backgate placed beneath the metagate is used as the
second gate, further modulating carrier density on regions in graphene that are
not directly screened by the metagate. With a strong carrier density
modulation, graphene electrons experience an array of deep potential wells, and
at large enough momenta perpendicular to the modulation direction, Dirac
electrons are waveguided via total internal reflections. These waveguided modes
appear as flat subbands with nearly equispaced energy levels. As a result,
there arise hybrid intersubband-polaritons with ultra-strong coupling in

explain the existence of ferromagnetism on the basis of his publication in
1920. The result, published in 1925 was disappointing, because only the one
dimensional case could be solved with a negative result about the absence of
ferromagnetism. Wolfgang Pauli who was an assistant of Lenz in Hamburg
published in the same year his 'nonclassical ambiguity', later identified as
the spin of the electron, and the exclusion principle. He was the first - at
the Solvay Conference in 1930 - to present the Hamiltonian of the Ising model
as we know it today.
  Meanwhile Ising had left university research and due to the political
situation in 1938 had to leave Germany and fled to Luxemburg. This went in hand
with damaging the network of researchers dealing with the problem of
ferromagnetism and more generally with phase transitions and statistical
physics. In 1944, the year when Luxemburg was liberated by the American troops
and Ising and his family was rescued, Lars Onsager presented a solution of the
two-dimensional case. In 1952 Chen-Ning Yang solved the problem of Ising's
thesis in two dimensions; one year later Ising became the US citizenship. The
following development showed, that the model turned out to be a highway to
modern physics concepts applicable also in other fields, although the final
exact solution in three dimensions has not yet been reached.

enhanced emission at the position of the possible collision.
  The aim of this work is to use the proper motions of the H_2 knots to confirm
the collision scenario.
  A second epoch H_2 image was obtained, and the proper motions of the knots
were determined with a time baseline of ~11 years. We also performed
differential photometry on the images to check the flux variability of the
knots.
  For each outflow (N and S) we classified the knots as pre-collision or
post-collision. The axes of the pre-collision knots, the position of the
possible collision point, and the axes of the post-collision knots were
estimated. The difference between the proper motion direction of the
post-collision knots and the position angle from the collision point was also
calculated. For some of the knots we obtained the 3D velocity by using the
radial velocity derived from H_2 spectra.
  The velocity pattern of the H_2 knots in the area of interaction
(post-collision knots) shows a deviation from that of the pre-collision knots,
consistent with being a consequence of the interaction between the two
outflows. This favours the interpretation of the IC 1396N outflows as a true
collision between two protostellar jets instead of a projection effect.

high-speed cameras. As an alternative, interpolating low-FPS videos from

are available, motion assumptions (linear or quadratic) are necessary to infer
intermediate frames, which fail to model complex motions. Event camera, a new
camera with pixels producing events of brightness change at the temporal
resolution of $\mu s$ $(10^{-6}$ second $)$, is a game-changing device to
enable video interpolation at the presence of arbitrarily complex motion. Since
event camera is a novel sensor, its potential has not been fulfilled due to the
lack of processing algorithms. The pioneering work Time Lens introduced event
cameras to video interpolation by designing optical devices to collect a large
amount of paired training data of high-speed frames and events, which is too
costly to scale. To fully unlock the potential of event cameras, this paper
proposes a novel TimeReplayer algorithm to interpolate videos captured by
commodity cameras with events. It is trained in an unsupervised
cycle-consistent style, canceling the necessity of high-speed training data and
bringing the additional ability of video extrapolation. Its state-of-the-art

recent studies to utilize self-supervised learning to pre-train deep neural

in image-based self-supervision is context prediction. In this approach, a
model is trained to reconstruct the contents of an arbitrary missing region of
an image based on its surroundings. However, the existing methods adopt a
random and blind masking approach by focusing uniformly on all regions of the

cause the model to forget the rich extracted features. In this work, we develop
a novel self-supervised approach that occludes targeted regions to improve the

agent which learns to intelligently mask input images through deep Q-learning.
We show that training the agent against the prediction model can significantly
improve the semantic features extracted for downstream classification tasks. We

TEM images of protein nanowires enables automated classification of nanowire
morphologies (e.g., single nanowires, nanowire bundles, phase separated) as
well as segmentation tasks that can serve as groundwork for quantification of
nanowire domain sizes and shape analysis. We also extend the application of the
machine learning workflow to classification of nanoparticle morphologies and
identification of different type of viruses from TEM images.

controlled by a steady out-of-plane electric field. In other EDRs the energy
conversion rate $\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}'$ is ""patchy"", with electron-scale
large-amplitude positive and negative peaks. We investigate 22 EDRs observed by
NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission in a wide range of conditions to
determine the cause of patchy $\vec{J}\cdot\vec{E}'$. The patchiness of the
energy conversion is quantified and correlated with seven parameters describing
various aspects of the asymptotic inflow regions that affect the structure,
stability, and efficiency of reconnection. We find that (1) neither the guide
field strength nor the asymmetries in the inflow ion pressure, electron
pressure, reconnecting magnetic field strength, and number density are well
correlated with the patchiness of the EDR energy conversion, (2) the
out-of-plane axes of the 22 EDRs are typically fairly well aligned with the
""preferred"" axes, which bisect the time-averaged inflow magnetic fields and
maximize the reconnection rate, and (3) the time-variability in the upstream
magnetic field direction is best correlated with the patchiness of the EDR

non-uniform inflow magnetic field is analyzed; the variation in the magnetic
field generates secondary X-lines, which develop to maximize the reconnection

Sepsis treatment is also very challenging because there is no consensus on what

optimal policies for treatment strategies mirroring physician actions. In the
healthcare scenario, the available data is mostly collected offline with no

techniques. The Offline RL paradigm suffers from action distribution shifts

clear we also need to remove CO$_2$ from the atmosphere in order to avoid some

CO$_2$ is among the most attractive approaches because of the large global
capacity and long-time scales for storage. One mechanism of geologic storage is
through carbon mineralization. Some mafic and ultramafic rocks contain minerals
that will react with CO$_2$ in a carbonation reaction and convert it to
carbonated minerals. This is effectively a permanent CO$_2$ storage mechanism.
The geologic question we are faced with is then to locate, delineate and
estimate the volume of potentially reactive rocks. Using a synthetic model that
emulates a prospective site for carbon mineralization in British Columbia, we
simulate and invert gravity and magnetic data to delineate reactive rocks. We
begin by inverting each data set independently and introduce a proxy experiment
to contend with the challenging problem of choosing an appropriate
physical-property threshold to estimate volumes from the recovered model. We
use this proxy experiment to estimate thresholds for standard, $\ell_2$
inversion of the gravity and magnetics, as well as for inversions which use
sparse and compact norms. A Petrophysically and Geologically Guided Inversion
(PGI) framework is used to construct quasi-geologic models from which volumes
can be estimated directly. We apply the PGI framework to the magnetics and
gravity data independently. The framework is also used to jointly invert these
data and produce a model that is consistent with both data sets. Cumulative
volume estimates with depth are informative and can help decide whether in situ
or ex situ sequestration might be appropriate. Using each of the inverted
models, we estimate cumulative volume of reactive rock as a function of depth.

Learning (MIL) paradigm. While standard supervised learning models expect a
label for every instance, MIL relaxes this and only considers bags of instances
to be labeled. This is ideally suited for flare prediction with IRIS data that
consists of time series of bags of UV spectra measured along the instrument
slit. In particular, we consider the readout window around the Mg II h&k lines
that encodes information on the dynamics of the solar chromosphere. Our MIL
models are not only able to predict whether flares occur within the next
$\sim$25 minutes with accuracies of around 90%, but are also able to explain
which spectral profiles were particularly important for their bag-level
prediction. This information can be used to highlight regions of interest in
ongoing IRIS observations in real-time and to identify candidates for typical
flare precursor spectral profiles. We use k-means clustering to extract groups
of spectral profiles that appear relevant for flare prediction. The recovered
groups show high intensity, triplet red wing emission and single-peaked h and k
lines, as found by previous works. They seem to be related to small-scale
explosive events that have been reported to occur tens of minutes before a
flare.

  Robots and Systems (IROS) 2022",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability in
autonomous navigation, but in order to scale SLAM to the setting of ""lifelong""
SLAM, particularly under memory or computation constraints, a robot must be
able to determine what information should be retained and what can safely be
forgotten. In graph-based SLAM, the number of edges (measurements) in a pose
graph determines both the memory requirements of storing a robot's observations
and the computational expense of algorithms deployed for performing state
estimation using those observations; both of which can grow unbounded during
long-term navigation. To address this, we propose a spectral approach for pose
graph sparsification which maximizes the algebraic connectivity of the
sparsified measurement graphs, a key quantity which has been shown to control
the estimation error of pose graph SLAM solutions. Our algorithm, MAC (for
""maximizing algebraic connectivity""), which is based on convex relaxation, is
simple and computationally inexpensive, and admits formal post hoc performance
guarantees on the quality of the solutions it provides. In experiments on
benchmark pose-graph SLAM datasets, we show that our approach quickly produces
high-quality sparsification results which retain the connectivity of the graph
and, in turn, the quality of corresponding SLAM solutions, as compared to a
baseline approach which does not consider graph connectivity.

problem where given an edge colored graph, with colors red and blue, and an
integer $k$, the goal is to decide whether or not the graph contains a perfect
matching with exactly $k$ red edges. Although they conjectured it to be
$\textbf{NP}$-complete, soon after it was shown to be solvable in randomized
polynomial time in the seminal work of Mulmuley et al., placing it in the
complexity class $\textbf{RP}$. Since then, all attempts at finding a
deterministic algorithm for EM have failed, thus leaving it as one of the few
natural combinatorial problems in $\textbf{RP}$ but not known to be contained
in $\textbf{P}$, and making it an interesting instance for testing the
hypothesis $\textbf{RP}=\textbf{P}$. Progress has been lacking even on very
restrictive classes of graphs despite the problem being quite well known as
evidenced by the number of works citing it.
  In this paper we aim to gain more insight into EM by studying a new
optimization problem we call Top-k Perfect Matching (TkPM) which we show to be
polynomially equivalent to EM. By virtue of being an optimization problem, it
is more natural to approximate TkPM so we provide approximation algorithms for
it. Some of the approximation algorithms rely on a relaxation of EM on
bipartite graphs where the output is required to be a perfect matching with a
number of red edges differing from $k$ by at most $k/2$, which is of
independent interest and generalizes to the Exact Weight Perfect Matching
(EWPM) problem. We also consider parameterized algorithms and show that TkPM
can be solved in FPT time parameterized by $k$ and the independence number of
the graph. This result again relies on new tools developed for EM which are
also of independent interest.

the Two-Choice process, for each of $m$ sequentially arriving balls, two
randomly chosen bins are sampled and the ball is placed in the least loaded
bin. It is well-known that the maximum load is $m/n+\log_2 \log n + O(1)$
w.h.p.
  Berenbrink, Czumaj, Englert, Friedetzky and Nagel (2012) introduced a
parallel version of this process, where $m$ balls arrive in consecutive batches
of size $b=n$ each. Balls within the same batch are allocated in parallel,
using the load information of the bins at the beginning of the batch. They
proved that the gap of this process is $O(\log n)$ with high probability.
  In this work, we present a new analysis of this setting, which is based on
exponential potential functions. This allows us to both simplify and generalize
the analysis of [BCE12] in different ways:
  $\quad 1.$ Our analysis covers a broad class of processes. This includes not
only Two-Choice, but also processes with fewer bin samples like $(1+\beta)$,
processes which can only receive one bit of information from each bin sample
and graphical allocation, where bins correspond to vertices in a graph.
  $\quad 2.$ Balls may be of different weights, as long as their weights are
independent samples from a distribution satisfying a technical condition on its
moment generating function.
  $\quad 3.$ For arbitrary batch sizes $b \geq n$, we prove a gap of $O(b/n
\cdot \log n)$. For any $b \in [n , n^3]$, we improve this to $O(b/n + \log n)$
and show that it is tight for a family of processes. This implies the
unexpected result that for e.g. $(1+\beta)$ with constant $\beta \in (0, 1]$,
the gap is $\Theta(\log n)$ for all $b \in [n,n \log n]$.
  We also conduct experiments which support our theoretical results, and even
hint at a superiority of less powerful processes like $(1+\beta)$ for large
batch sizes.

object classification from localization by leveraging a base detector that is

test-time-training. This result is even more significant considering its many
practical advantages: (1) incrementally learning new classes in sequence
without additional training, (2) detecting both novel and seen classes in a
single pass, and (3) no forgetting of previously seen classes. We benchmark our

smooth, high- or infinite-dimensional functions from limited samples. This is a
key task in computational science and engineering, e.g., surrogate modelling in
UQ where the function is the solution map of a parametric or stochastic PDE.
Yet, sparse polynomial approximation lacks a complete theory. On the one hand,
there is a well-developed theory of best $s$-term polynomial approximation,
which asserts exponential or algebraic rates of convergence for holomorphic
functions. On the other hand, there are increasingly mature methods such as
(weighted) $\ell^1$-minimization for computing such approximations. While the
sample complexity of these methods has been analyzed in detail, the matter of
whether or not these methods achieve such rates is not well understood.
Furthermore, these methods are not algorithms per se, since they involve exact
minimizers of nonlinear optimization problems.
  This paper closes these gaps. Specifically, we pose and answer the following
question: are there robust, efficient algorithms for computing approximations
to finite- or infinite-dimensional, holomorphic and Hilbert-valued functions
from limited samples that achieve best $s$-term rates? We answer this in the
affirmative by introducing algorithms and theoretical guarantees that assert
exponential or algebraic rates of convergence, along with robustness to
sampling, algorithmic, and physical discretization errors. We tackle both
scalar- and Hilbert-valued functions, this being particularly relevant to
parametric and stochastic PDEs. Our work involves several significant
developments of existing techniques, including a novel restarted primal-dual
iteration for solving weighted $\ell^1$-minimization problems in Hilbert

formulation of gravity. In the standard formulation of General Relativity \'a
la Einstein, the gravitational interaction is geometrized in terms of the
spacetime curvature. However, if we embrace the geometrical character of
gravity, two alternative, though equivalent, formulations of General Relativity
emerge in flat spacetimes, in which gravity is fully ascribed either to torsion
or to non-metricity. The latter allows a much simpler formulation of General
Relativity oblivious to the affine spacetime structure, the Coincident General
Relativity. The entropy of a black hole can be computed using the Euclidean
path integral approach, which strongly relies on the addition of boundary or
regulating terms in the standard formulation of General Relativity. A more
fundamental derivation can be performed using Wald's formula, in which the
entropy is directly related to Noether charges and is applicable to general
theories with diffeomorphism invariance. In this work we extend Wald's Noether
charge method for calculating black hole entropy to spacetimes endowed with
non-metricity. Using this method, we show that Coincident General Relativity
with an improved action principle gives the same entropy as the well-known
entropy in standard General Relativity. Furthermore the first law of black hole
thermodynamics holds and an explicit expression for the energy appearing in the
first law is obtained.

media. Many studies have used simulations of such interactions to investigate
the effect of particular physical processes, but the impact of the choice of
hydrodynamics solver has largely been overlooked. Here we study the cloud-wind
interaction, also known as the ""blob test"", using seven different hydrodynamics
solvers: Three flavours of SPH, a moving mesh, adaptive mesh refinement and two
meshless schemes. The evolution of masses in dense gas and
intermediate-temperature gas, as well as the covering fraction of
intermediate-temperature gas, are systematically compared for initial density
contrasts of 10 and 100, and five numerical resolutions. To isolate the
differences due to the hydrodynamics solvers, we use idealised non-radiative
simulations without physical conduction. We find large differences between
these methods. SPH methods show slower dispersal of the cloud, particularly for
the higher density contrast, but faster convergence, especially for the lower
density contrast. Predictions for the intermediate-temperature gas differ
particularly strongly, also between non-SPH codes, and converge most slowly. We
conclude that the hydrodynamical interaction between a dense cloud and a
supersonic wind remains an unsolved problem. Studies aiming to understand the
physics or observational signatures of cloud-wind interactions should test the
robustness of their results by comparing different hydrodynamics solvers.

architectures and accelerators, hardware-software co-design has been emerging
to fully reap the benefits of flexible design spaces and optimize neural
network performance. Nonetheless, such co-design also enlarges the total search
space to practically infinity and presents substantial challenges. While the
prior studies have been focusing on improving the search efficiency (e.g., via
reinforcement learning), they commonly rely on co-searches over the entire
architecture-accelerator design space. In this paper, we propose a
\emph{semi}-decoupled approach to reduce the size of the total design space by
orders of magnitude, yet without losing optimality. We first perform neural
architecture search to obtain a small set of optimal architectures for one
accelerator candidate. Importantly, this is also the set of (close-to-)optimal
architectures for other accelerator designs based on the property that neural
architectures' ranking orders in terms of inference latency and energy
consumption on different accelerator designs are highly similar. Then, instead
of considering all the possible architectures, we optimize the accelerator
design only in combination with this small set of architectures, thus
significantly reducing the total search cost. We validate our approach by
conducting experiments on various architecture spaces for accelerator designs
with different dataflows. Our results highlight that we can obtain the optimal
design by only navigating over the reduced search space. The source code of

control of systematic factors both in experimental measurements and theoretical
computations. Various synergies between experimental and theoretical studies of
the hadron structure are explored, including opportunities for studying PDFs

dependence on the transverse momentum, for incisive comparisons between
phenomenological models for the PDFs and computations on discrete lattice, and

obvious how to compare the quality of different methods. This lack of consensus
creates a critical shortage of rigour in the field, although little is written

conducted a semi-systematic meta-survey over fifteen literature surveys
covering the evaluation of explainability to identify existing criteria usable

the paper is the suggestion to use appropriate trust as a criterion to measure
the outcome of the subjective evaluation criteria and consequently make
comparative evaluations possible. We also present a model of explanation
quality aspects. In the model, criteria with similar definitions are grouped

quantum algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Meanwhile,
these problems have been studied extensively in classical computing for
decades. In this paper, we explore a natural approach to leveraging existing
classical techniques to enhance quantum optimization. Specifically, we run a
classical algorithm to find an approximate solution and then use a quantum
circuit to search its ""neighborhood"" for higher-quality solutions. We propose
the Classically-Boosted Quantum Optimization Algorithm (CBQOA) that is based on
this idea and can solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems,
including all unconstrained problems and many important constrained problems
such as Max Bisection, Maximum Independent Set, Minimum Vertex Cover, Portfolio
Optimization, Traveling Salesperson and so on. A crucial component of this
algorithm is an efficiently-implementable continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW)
on a properly-constructed graph that connects the feasible solutions. CBQOA
utilizes this CTQW and the output of an efficient classical procedure to create
a suitable superposition of the feasible solutions which is then processed in
certain way. This algorithm has the merits that it solves constrained problems
without modifying their cost functions, confines the evolution of the quantum
state to the feasible subspace, and does not rely on efficient indexing of the
feasible solutions. We demonstrate the applications of CBQOA to Max 3SAT and
Max Bisection, and provide empirical evidence that it outperforms previous
approaches on these problems.

simulated binary signals similar to GW190412 and GW190814. We show that the
inclusion of higher modes improves both the precision and the accuracy of the
measurement of the deviation parameters. Our testing framework also allows us
to vary the underlying baseline GR waveform model and the frequency at which
the non-GR inspiral corrections are tapered off. We find that to optimize the
GR test of high-mass binaries, comprehensive studies would need to be done to
determine the best choice of the tapering frequency as a function of the
binary's properties. We also carry out an analysis on the binary neutron-star

suggests macrodissection areas. To predict DNA yield per slide, the extracted
features are correlated with known DNA yields. Then, a pathologist-defined
target yield divided by the predicted DNA yield/slide gives the number of
slides to scrape. Following model development, an internal validation trial was
conducted within the Tempus Labs molecular sequencing laboratory. We evaluated
our system on 501 clinical colorectal cancer slides, where half received
SmartPath-augmented review and half traditional pathologist review. The
SmartPath cohort had 25% more DNA yields within a desired target range of
100-2000ng. The SmartPath system recommended fewer slides to scrape for large
tissue sections, saving tissue in these cases. Conversely, SmartPath
recommended more slides to scrape for samples with scant tissue sections,
helping prevent costly re-extraction due to insufficient extraction yield. A
statistical analysis was performed to measure the impact of covariates on the
results, offering insights on how to improve future applications of SmartPath.
Overall, the study demonstrated that AI-augmented histopathologic review using

turbulent. Cosmic rays (CRs) propagate through it, and those with energies from
$\sim\,\rm{GeV} - \rm{TeV}$ are likely subject to the streaming instability,
whereby the wave damping processes balances excitation of resonant ionic
Alfv\'en waves by the CRs, reaching an equilibrium in which the propagation
speed of the CRs is very close to the local ion Alfv\'en velocity. The
transport of streaming CRs is therefore sensitive to ionic Alfv\'en velocity
fluctuations. In this paper we systematically study these fluctuations using a
large ensemble of compressible MHD turbulence simulations. We show that for
sub-Alfv\'enic turbulence, as applies for a strongly magnetized ISM, the ionic
Alfv\'en velocity probability density function (PDF) is determined solely by
the density fluctuations from shocked gas forming parallel to the magnetic
field, and we develop analytical models for the ionic Alfv\'en velocity PDF up
to second moments. For super-Alfv\'enic turbulence, magnetic and density
fluctuations are correlated in complex ways, and these correlations as well as
contributions from the magnetic fluctuations sets the ionic Alfv\'en velocity
PDF. We discuss the implications of these findings for underlying ""macroscopic""
diffusion mechanisms in CRs undergoing the streaming instability, including
modeling the macroscopic diffusion coefficient for the parallel transport in
sub-Alfv\'enic plasmas. We also describe how, for highly-magnetized turbulent

information about ionic Alfv\'en velocity structure from observations of the

measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. However, this requires
the \textit{a priori} choice of type and cut-off frequencies for the bandpass
filter needed to perform the analysis. Here we explore alternative approaches
based on the use of various mode decomposition (MD) techniques that circumvent
this issue. These techniques allow for the data driven decomposition of signals
jointly into narrow-band components at different frequencies, thus fulfilling
the requirements needed to measure PS. We explore several variants of MD,
including empirical mode decomposition (EMD), bivariate EMD (BEMD),
noise-assisted multivariate EMD (na-MEMD), and introduce the use of
multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) in the context of estimating
time-varying PS. We contrast the approaches using a series of simulations and

a tool to reliably investigate time-varying PS in rs-fMRI data.

attention in recent years. It particularly motivates researchers to formulate
learning and evaluating recommendation as causal inference and data

violating the critical assumption of overlapping, which we prove can

a critical piece missing in the current understanding of information retrieval

that best transports the patterns it learns from the observed domain to its
intervention domain. Towards this end, we use domain transportation to
characterize the learning-intervention mechanism of recommendation. We design a

learning and Strictly Negative Imaginary (SNI) property. The first stage of our
control approach is to transform a nonlinear quadrotor system into an
equivalent Negative-Imaginary (NI) linear model by means of the feedback
linearization (FL) technique. The second phase is to design a control scheme
that adapts online the Strictly Negative Imaginary (SNI) controller gains via
fuzzy Q-learning, inspired by biological learning. The proposed controller does
not require any prior training. The performance of the designed controller is
compared with that of a fixed-gain SNI controller, a fuzzy-SNI controller, and
a conventional PID controller in a series of numerical simulations.
Furthermore, the stability of the proposed controller and the adaptive laws are

quality by leveraging diverse yet complementary information embedded in
different imaging modalities. However, existing methods still have two
shortcomings: (1) they neglect that the multi-contrast features at different
scales contain different anatomical details and hence lack effective mechanisms
to match and fuse these features for better reconstruction; and (2) they are
still deficient in capturing long-range dependencies, which are essential for
the regions with complicated anatomical structures. We propose a novel network
to comprehensively address these problems by developing a set of innovative
Transformer-empowered multi-scale contextual matching and aggregation
techniques; we call it McMRSR. Firstly, we tame transformers to model
long-range dependencies in both reference and target images. Then, a new

contexts from reference features at different scales. Furthermore, we introduce
a multi-scale aggregation mechanism to gradually and interactively aggregate
multi-scale matched features for reconstructing the target SR MR image.

attacks (CCPA), the design of defenses has gained significant attention. A
popular approach is to eliminate the existence of attacks by either securing
existing sensors or deploying secured PMUs. In this work, we improve this
approach by lowering the defense target from eliminating attacks to preventing
outages and reducing the required number of PMUs. To this end, we formulate the
problem of PMU Placement for Outage Prevention (PPOP) under DC power flow model
as a tri-level non-linear optimization problem and transform it into a bi-level
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Then, we propose an
alternating optimization framework to solve PPOP by iteratively adding
constraints, for which we develop two constraint generation algorithms. In
addition, for large-scale grids, we propose a polynomial-time heuristic
algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions. Next, we extend our solution to
achieve the defense goal under AC power flow model. Finally, we evaluate our
algorithm on IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus systems, which
demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach in greatly reducing the

in dependence logic, through a rather surprising connection to the so-called

the setting of inquisitive logic with tensor disjunction discussed by Ciardelli
and Barbero (2019}, but from an epistemic perspective. More specifically, we
translate the propositional formulae of inquisitive logic with tensor into
modal formulae in a powerful epistemic language of ""knowing how"" following the
proposal by Wang (2021). We give a complete axiomatization of the logic of our
full language based on Fine's axiomatization of S5 modal logic with
propositional quantifiers. Finally, we generalize the tensor operator with
parameters $k$ and $n$, which intuitively captures the epistemic situation that
one knows $n$ potential answers to $n$ questions and is sure $k$ answers of
them must be correct. The original tensor disjunction is the special case when
$k=1$ and $n=2$. We show that the generalized tensor operators do not increase
the expressive power of our logic, the inquisitive logic, and propositional
dependence logic, though most of these generalized tensors are not uniformly
definable in these logics, except in our dynamic epistemic logic of knowing
how.

extended surface Fermi loops with a non-contractible winding topology on the

comprises two distinctive modules: (a) a first-person vision (FPV) module,
which uses a short egocentric view sequence as the intersection is passed, and
(b) a third-person vision (TPV) module, which uses a single view immediately
before entering the intersection. The self-attention mechanism is effective in
the TPV module because most parts of the local pattern (e.g., road edges,
buildings, and sky) are similar to each other, and thus the use of a non-local
context (e.g., the angle between two diagonal corners around an intersection)
would be effective. This study makes three major contributions. First, we
proposed a self-attention-based approach for intersection classification using
TPVs. Second, we presented a practical system in which a self-attention-based
TPV module is combined with an FPV module to improve the overall recognition
performance. Finally, experiments using the public KITTI dataset show that the

(e.g., a few days, several months, and years) by exposure from when they would
occur without the exposure, which is common in environmental time-series
studies. Using concepts of a frail population and loss of life expectancy, it
is understood that mortality displacement may decrease rate ratio (RR). Such
decreases are thought to be minimal or substantial depending on study
populations. Environmental epidemiologists have interpreted RR considering
mortality displacement. This theoretical paper reveals that mortality
displacement can be formulated as a built-in selection bias of RR in Cox models
due to unmeasured risk factors independent from exposure of interest, and
mortality displacement can also be viewed as an effect modifier by integrating
the concepts of rate and loss of life expectancy. Thus, depending on the
framework through which we view bias, mortality displacement can be categorized
as selection bias in the bias taxonomy of epidemiology, and simultaneously
mortality displacement can be seen as an effect modifier. This dichotomy
provides useful implications regarding policy, effect modification, exposure
time-windows selection, and generalizability, specifically why research in
epidemiology may produce unexpected and heterogeneous RR over different studies
and sub-populations.

sensitivity. This analysis prompted the development of a multi-pixel
beamforming functionality that can generate dozens of tied-array beams
simultaneously, which runs a factor of ten times faster compared to the
original single-pixel version. This enhancement makes it feasible to observe
multiple pulsars within the vast field of view of the MWA and supports the
ongoing large-scale pulsar survey efforts with the MWA. We explore the extent

  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training a deep neural network for semantic segmentation is labor intensive,
so it is common to pre-train on a different task for which data is abundant,
typically image-level classification, and then fine-tune with a small annotated
dataset. There is empirical evidence showing that incorporating depth
information during training may improve semantic segmentation, but the extent
of this effect has yet to be fully characterized. In this paper, we study
whether monocular depth estimation can serve as pre-training for semantic
segmentation, ideally eliminating the need for manually supervised
pre-training. Using common benchmarks such as KITTI, Cityscapes, and NYU-V2, we
evaluate pre-training using depth estimation vs. classification, measuring
their effects on downstream semantic segmentation. The former edges out the
latter by 5.8\% mIoU and 5.2\% pixel accuracy. We analyze the impact of
different forms of supervision for depth estimation, training pipelines, and
data resolution on semantic fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that other forms
of self-supervision are less effective than depth pre-training, including
optical flow, despite sharing the same loss, namely the photometric
reprojection error.

several sub-consensus models by random sub-sampling over clients and then

the Morse oscillator. The relationship between the commutator of operators and
other parameters of Morse oscillator is investigated. We show that the
mathematical structure of operators which depends on the parameters of Morse
oscillator may change our conventional expectation. The parameter space of
Morse oscillator is visualized to scrutinize the mathematical relations that
are related to the Morse oscillator. This parameter space is the space of
possible parameter values that depend on the depth of the Morse potential well
and other parameters. The algorithm that we present is also applicable to other

and casting all the existing combinations in each group into a generic
framework. We systematically cover all easily available papers irrespective of
their publication status, focusing on the combination mechanisms rather than on

2017. We hope this effort will favor the growth of the domain by facilitating
the understanding of the relationships between the methods, leading to deeper
analyses, outlining missing useful comparisons and suggesting new combinations
of mechanisms.

formulae, and their improved versions by considering the isospin dependence are
adopted as examples. The parameters in these six formulae are refitted using
the Levenberg-Marquardt method, which give better results than the previous
ones. The radius for each nucleus is predicted with the KRR network, which is
trained with the deviations between experimental and calculated nuclear charge
radii. For each formula, the resultant root-mean-square deviations of 884
nuclei with proton number $Z \geq 8$ and neutron number $N \geq 8$ can be
reduced to about 0.017~fm after considering the modification of the KRR method.

examined carefully and compared with the radial basis function method. It is
found that the improved nuclear charge radius formulae by KRR method can avoid
the risk of overfitting and have a good extrapolation ability. The influence of

To avoid this phenomenon termed catastrophic forgetting, continual learning,
also known as lifelong learning, has been proposed and become one of the most
up-to-date research areas of machine learning. As quantum machine learning
blossoms in recent years, it is interesting to develop quantum continual
learning. This paper focuses on the case of quantum models for quantum data
where the computation model and the data to be processed are both quantum. The
gradient episodic memory method is incorporated to design a quantum continual
learning scheme that overcomes catastrophic forgetting and realizes knowledge
backward transfer. Specifically, a sequence of quantum state classification
tasks is continually learned by a variational quantum classifier whose
parameters are optimized by a classical gradient-based optimizer. The gradient
of the current task is projected to the closest gradient, avoiding the increase
of the loss at previous tasks, but allowing the decrease. Numerical simulation
results show that our scheme not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting, but
also realize knowledge backward transfer, which means the classifier's
performance on previous tasks is enhanced rather than compromised while

however, not predetermined, but dynamic and guided by the (reduced, spin-only)
wave function of the system, which is conditional on the realized location
values of the particles. In this way, the unavoidable contextuality of spin is
provided by the wave function and its realized particle configuration, whereas
spin is still expressed as a local property of the individual particles. This
formulation, which furthermore features a rigorous discrete-time stochastic
dynamics, allows for numerical simulations of particle systems with entangled
spin, such as Bohm's version of the EPR experiment.

to a single data source. The key difference between the proposed method and
existing approaches is that raw source-wise factor score subspaces are utilized
in the identification of the partially-joint block-wise association structure.
To identify common score subspaces, which may be partially joint to some of
data sources, from noisy observations, the proposed algorithm sequentially
computes one-dimensional flag means among source-wise score subspaces, then
collects the subspaces that are close to the mean. The proposed decomposition
boasts fast computational speed, and is superior in identifying the true
partially-joint association structure and recovering the joint loading and
score subspaces than competing approaches. The proposed decomposition is
applied to a blood cancer multi-omics data set, containing measurements from

significance of facial crucial regions for FER, many existing researches
utilize the prior information from some annotated crucial points to improve the
performance of FER. However, it is complicated and time-consuming to manually
annotate facial crucial points, especially for vast wild expression images.
Based on this, a local non-local joint network is proposed to adaptively light
up the facial crucial regions in feature learning of FER in this paper. In the
proposed method, two parts are constructed based on facial local and non-local
information respectively, where an ensemble of multiple local networks are
proposed to extract local features corresponding to multiple facial local
regions and a non-local attention network is addressed to explore the
significance of each local region. Especially, the attention weights obtained
by the non-local network is fed into the local part to achieve the interactive
feedback between the facial global and local information. Interestingly, the
non-local weights corresponding to local regions are gradually updated and
higher weights are given to more crucial regions. Moreover, U-Net is employed
to extract the integrated features of deep semantic information and low
hierarchical detail information of expression images. Finally, experimental
results illustrate that the proposed method achieves more competitive
performance compared with several state-of-the art methods on five benchmark

  thermal modulator with common reservoirs","30 pages,8 figures",,"10.1088/1751-8121/ac8bb4",,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper systematically studied heat transfer through two transversely
coupled qubits in contact with two types of heat reservoirs. One is the
independent heat reservoir which essentially interacts with only a single
qubit, the other is the common heat reservoir which is allowed to
simultaneously interact with two qubits. Compared to independent heat
reservoirs, common reservoirs always suppress heat current in most cases.
However, the common environment could enhance heat current, if the dissipation
rate corresponding to the higher eigenfrequency is significantly higher than
that corresponding to the lower eigenfrequency. In particular, in the case of
resonant coupling of two qubits and the proper dissipations, the steady state
can be decomposed into a stationary dark state which doesn't evolve and
contributes zero heat current, and a residual steady state which corresponds to
the maximal heat current. This dark state enables us to control steady-state
heat current with an external control field and design a thermal modulator. In
addition, we find that inverse heat currents could be present in the
dissipative subchannels between the system and reservoirs, which interprets the
suppression roles of common heat reservoirs. We also calculate the concurrence
of assistance (COA) of the system and find that heat current and COA have the
same trend with temperature, which further indicates that entanglement can be
regarded as a resource to regulate heat transport.

between their flexible membrane wings and the air with great ease. Yet,
replicating and scaling the balance between the structural and fluid-dynamical
parameters of unsteady membrane wings for engineering applications remains
challenging. In this study, we introduce a novel bio-inspired membrane wing
design and systematically investigate the fluid-structure interactions of
flapping membrane wings. The membrane wing can passively camber and its leading
and trailing edges rotate with respect to the stroke plane. We find optimal
combinations of the membrane properties and flapping kinematics that
out-perform their rigid counterparts both in terms of increased stroke-average
lift and efficiency but the improvements are not persistent over the entire
input parameter space. The lift and efficiency optima occur at different angles
of attack and effective membrane stiffnesses which we characterise with the
aeroelastic number. At optimal aeroelastic numbers, the membrane has a moderate
camber between 15% and 20% and its leading and trailing edges align favourably
with the flow. Higher camber at lower aeroelastic numbers leads to reduced
aerodynamic performance due to negative angles of attack at the leading edge
and an over-rotation of the trailing edge. Most of the performance gain of the
membrane wings with respect to rigid wings is achieved in the second half of
the stroke when the wing is decelerating. The stroke-maximum camber is reached
around mid-stroke but is sustained during most of the remainder of the stroke
which leads to an increase in lift and a reduction in power. Our results show
that combining the effect of variable stiffness and angle of attack variation
can significantly enhance the aerodynamic performance of membrane wings and has
the potential to improve the control capabilities of micro air vehicles.

the magnetosphere generates strong ionospheric signatures and a sharp variation
in the ground magnetic field, termed sudden commencement (SC). Whilst such
compressions have also been associated with a contraction of the ionospheric
polar cap due to the triggering of reconnection in the magnetotail, the effect
of any changes in dayside reconnection is less clear and is a key component in
fully understanding the system response. In this study we explore the
time-dependent nature of dayside coupling during SC by performing global
simulations using the Gorgon MHD code, and impact the magnetosphere with a
series of interplanetary shocks with different parameters. We identify the
location and evolution of the reconnection region in each case as the shock
propagates through the magnetosphere, finding strong enhancement in the dayside
reconnection rate and prompt expansion of the dayside polar cap prior to the
eventual triggering of tail reconnection. This effect pervades for a variety of
IMF orientations, and the reconnection rate is most enhanced for events with
higher dynamic pressure. We explain this by repeating the simulations with a
large explicit resistivity, showing that compression of the magnetosheath
plasma near the propagating shock front allows for reconnection of much greater
intensity and at different locations on the dayside magnetopause than during
typical solar wind conditions. The results indicate that the dynamic behaviour
of dayside coupling may render steady models of reconnection inaccurate during
the onset of a severe space weather event.

artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the full sky CMB angular power
spectrum between intermediate to large angular scales from the partial sky
spectrum obtained from masked CMB temperature anisotropy map. We use a simple
ANN architecture with one hidden layer containing $895$ neurons. Using $1.2
\times 10^{5}$ training samples of full sky and corresponding partial sky CMB
angular power spectra at Healpix pixel resolution parameter $N_{side} = 256$,
we show that predicted spectrum by our ANN agrees well with the target spectrum
at each realization for the multipole range $2 \leq l \leq 512$. The predicted
spectra are statistically unbiased and they preserve the cosmic variance
accurately. Statistically, the differences between the mean predicted and
underlying theoretical spectra are within approximately $3\sigma$. Moreover,
the probability densities obtained from predicted angular power spectra agree
very well with those obtained from `actual' full sky CMB angular power spectra
for each multipole. Interestingly, our work shows that the significant
correlations in input cut-sky spectra, due to mode-mode coupling introduced on
the partial sky, are effectively removed since the ANN learns the hidden
pattern between the partial sky and full sky spectra preserving the entire
statistical properties. The excellent agreement of statistical properties
between the predicted and the ground-truth demonstrates the importance of using
artificial intelligence systems in cosmological analysis more widely.

by incorporating bargaining game and matching game, which is called
BARGAIN-MATCH. First, for resource allocation, a bargaining game-based

triggers spin currents and related spin-transfer torques which further tilt the
magnetizations and govern the relaxation processes of the spin dynamics.
Analyzing different scenarios of the applied bias voltage, we show that
symmetric and asymmetric voltage drops can lead to relaxation times of the spin
dynamics that differ by several orders of magnitude at comparable charge
currents. In both cases we observe resonant features, where the relaxation is

global scale is entailing a rethinking of the production models in sustainable
terms. As a consequence, energy suppliers are starting to adopt strategies that
flatten demand peaks in power plants by means of pricing policies that
stimulate a change in the consumption practices of customers. A representative
example is the Time-of-Use (TOU)-based tariffs policy, which encourages
electricity usage at off-peak hours by means of low prices, while penalizing
peak hours with higher prices. The TOU-based tariffs policy induces a
partitioning of the time horizon into a set of time slots, each associated with
a cost that becomes a part of the optimization objective. This thesis focuses
on a representative bi-objective energy-efficient job scheduling problem on
parallel identical machines under TOU-based tariffs by delving into the
description of its inherent properties, mathematical formulations, and solution
approaches. Specifically, the thesis starts by reviewing the flourishing
literature on the subject, and providing a useful framework for theoreticians
and practitioners. Subsequently, it describes the considered problem and
investigates its theoretical properties. In the same chapter, it presents a
first mathematical model for the problem, as well as a possible reformulation
that exploits the structure of the solution space so as to achieve a
considerable increase in compactness. Afterwards, the thesis introduces a
sophisticated heuristic scheme to tackle the inherent hardness of the problem,
and an exact algorithm that exploits the mathematical models. Then, it shows
the computational efficiency of the presented solution approaches on a wide

sparse distribution of dust in the intracluster space that makes extinction
measurements difficult or because of a low surface brightness of infrared
emission from dust. Complex indirect approaches are currently available that
can overcome uncertainties and provide a reasonable understanding of the basic
regulations of the physical state of dust in the ICM. Contrary to the common
opinion that the hot ICM does not allow dust to survive and manifest, many
sparse observational data either directly point out that dust exists in the
intracluster space or its presence is consistent with the data. Highly
divergent data in direct evidence and highly uncertain indirect indicators are
often connected either with dust fragility in a hot environment, the possible
compactness of spatial (clumpy) dust distribution in the ICM, or dynamical
features of dust transport. The source of dust is obviously connected with
galaxies, and it turns out that in most cases, dust is carried from galaxies
into the ICM while being thermally and dynamically shielded against the hostile
influence of high-energy ions. In this review, we briefly discuss related
issues from observational and theoretical points of view, including the
transport of dust into the ICM, and the associated destructive and protective

avoid excessive peaks or achieve better balancing. Whereas the majority of
existing research works either focus on control strategies for a single EV
charger, or use a multi-step approach (e.g., a first high level aggregate
control decision step, followed by individual EV control decisions), we rather
propose a single-step solution that jointly coordinates multiple charging
points at once. In this paper, we further refine an initial proposal using
reinforcement learning (RL), specifically addressing computational challenges
that would limit its deployment in practice. More precisely, we design a new
Markov decision process (MDP) formulation of the EV charging coordination
process, exhibiting only linear space and time complexity (as opposed to the
earlier quadratic space complexity). We thus improve upon earlier
state-of-the-art, demonstrating 30% reduction of training time in our case
study using real-world EV charging session data. Yet, we do not sacrifice the
resulting performance in meeting the DR objectives: our new RL solutions still
improve the performance of charging demand coordination by 40-50% compared to a

the key quality aspects, generalization, is concerned with measuring the degree
of overfitting of a process model w.r.t. an event log, since the recorded
behavior is just an example of the true behavior of the underlying business
process. Existing generalization measures exhibit several shortcomings that
severely hinder their applicability in practice. For example, they assume the
event log fully fits the discovered process model, and cannot deal with large
real-life event logs and complex process models. More significantly, current
measures neglect generalizations for clear patterns that demand a certain
construct in the model. For example, a repeating sequence in an event log
should be generalized with a loop structure in the model. We address these
shortcomings by proposing a framework of measures that generalize a set of
patterns discovered from an event log with representative traces and check the
corresponding control-flow structures in the process model via their trace
alignment. We instantiate the framework with a generalization measure that uses
tandem repeats to identify repetitive patterns that are compared to the loop
structures and a concurrency oracle to identify concurrent patterns that are
compared to the parallel structures of the process model. In an extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluation using 74 log-model pairs using against
two baseline generalization measures, we show that the proposed generalization
measure consistently ranks process models that fulfil the observed patterns
with generalizing control-flow structures higher than those which do not, while
the baseline measures disregard those patterns. Further, we show that our
measure can be efficiently computed for datasets two orders of magnitude larger

distribution-to-distribution mapping make the learning unstable and limit their
performance. This study introduces the remix-cycle-consistency loss as a more
appropriate objective function and uses it to fine-tune adversarially learned
source separation models. The remix-cycle-consistency loss is defined as the
difference between the mixed speech observed at microphones and the
pseudo-mixed speech obtained by alternating the process of separating the mixed
sound and remixing its outputs with another combination. The minimization of
this loss leads to an explicit reduction in the distortions in the output of
the separation network. Experimental comparisons with multichannel speech

Is there a continuum limit with simple properties? We attack this problem by
mapping certain classes of automata to quantum field theories for which
powerful methods exist for this type of problem. Indeed, many cellular automata
admit an interpretation in terms of fermionic particles. Reversible automata on
space-lattices with a local updating rule can be described by a partition
function or Grassmann functional integral for interacting fermions moving in
this space. We discuss large classes of automata that are equivalent to
discretized fermionic quantum field theories with various types of
interactions. Two-dimensional models include relativistic Thirring or
Gross-Neveu type models with abelian or non-abelian continuous global
symmetries, models with local gauge symmetries, and spinor gravity with local
Lorentz symmetry as well as diffeomorphism invariance in the (naive) continuum
limit.
  The limit of a very large number of cells needs a probabilistic description.
Probabilistic cellular automata are characterized by a probability distribution
over initial bit-configurations. They can be described by the quantum formalism
with wave functions, density matrix and non-commuting operators associated to
observables, which are the same for the automata and associated fermionic
quantum theories. This formalism is crucial for a discussion of concepts as
vacuum states, spontaneous symmetry breaking, coarse graining and the continuum
limit for probabilistic cellular automata. In particular, we perform explicitly
the continuum limit for an automaton that describes a quantum particle in a

MH-Aug produces a sequence of augmented graphs from the target distribution
enables flexible control of the strength and diversity of augmentation. Since
the direct sampling from the complex target distribution is challenging, we
adopt the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain the augmented samples. We

promising approach to address this issue. Existing works usually take the
common aid from auto-encoders to establish the self-supervision by the
self-reconstruction schema. However, the previous auto-encoders merely focus on
the global shapes and do not distinguish the local and global geometric
features apart. To address this problem, we present a novel and efficient
self-supervised point cloud representation learning framework, named 3D
Occlusion Auto-Encoder (3D-OAE), to facilitate the detailed supervision
inherited in local regions and global shapes. We propose to randomly occlude
some local patches of point clouds and establish the supervision via inpainting
the occluded patches using the remaining ones. Specifically, we design an
asymmetrical encoder-decoder architecture based on standard Transformer, where
the encoder operates only on the visible subset of patches to learn local
patterns, and a lightweight decoder is designed to leverage these visible
patterns to infer the missing geometries via self-attention. We find that
occluding a very high proportion of the input point cloud (e.g. 75%) will still
yield a nontrivial self-supervisory performance, which enables us to achieve
3-4 times faster during training but also improve accuracy. Experimental
results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on a diverse

  Things: Building accountability and security""",,,,"cs.DC cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Machine Learning (ML) techniques have begun to dominate data analytics
applications and services. Recommendation systems are a key component of online
service providers. The financial industry has adopted ML to harness large
volumes of data in areas such as fraud detection, risk-management, and
compliance. Deep Learning is the technology behind voice-based personal
assistants, etc. Deployment of ML technologies onto cloud computing
infrastructures has benefited numerous aspects of our daily life. The
advertising and associated online industries in particular have fuelled a rapid
rise the in deployment of personal data collection and analytics tools.
Traditionally, behavioural analytics relies on collecting vast amounts of data
in centralised cloud infrastructure before using it to train machine learning
models that allow user behaviour and preferences to be inferred. A contrasting
approach, distributed data analytics, where code and models for training and
inference are distributed to the places where data is collected, has been
boosted by two recent, ongoing developments: increased processing power and
memory capacity available in user devices at the edge of the network, such as
smartphones and home assistants; and increased sensitivity to the highly
intrusive nature of many of these devices and services and the attendant
demands for improved privacy. Indeed, the potential for increased privacy is
not the only benefit of distributing data analytics to the edges of the
network: reducing the movement of large volumes of data can also improve energy
efficiency, helping to ameliorate the ever increasing carbon footprint of our
digital infrastructure, enabling much lower latency for service interactions
than is possible when services are cloud-hosted. These approaches often
introduce challenges in privacy, utility, and efficiency trade-offs, while
having to ensure fruitful user engagement.

develop systematically designed, open databases of material properties.
However, there are few open databases for polymeric materials compared to other
material systems such as inorganic crystals. To this end, we developed RadonPy,
the world-first open-source Python library for fully automated all-atom
classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For a given polymer repeating
unit, the entire process of molecular modeling, equilibrium and nonequilibrium
MD calculations, and property calculations can be conducted fully
automatically. In this study, 15 different properties, including the thermal
conductivity, density, specific heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficients,
and refractive index, were calculated for more than 1,000 unique amorphous
polymers. The calculated properties were compared and validated systematically
with experimental values from PoLyInfo. During the high-throughput data
production, eight amorphous polymers with extremely high thermal
conductivities, exceeding 0.4 W/mK, were identified, including six polymers
with unreported thermal conductivities. These polymers were found to have a
high density of hydrogen bonding units or rigid backbones. A decomposition
analysis of the heat conduction, which is implemented in RadonPy, revealed the
underlying mechanisms that yield a high thermal conductivity of the amorphous
polymers: heat transfer via hydrogen bonds and dipole-dipole interactions
between the polymer chains with their hydrogen bonding units or via the
covalent bonds of the polymer backbone with high rigidity. The creation of
massive amounts of computational property data using RadonPy will facilitate
the development of polymer informatics, similar to how the emergence of the
first-principles computational database for inorganic crystals had
significantly advanced materials informatics.

the ability to infer beyond the traditional physical/textural attributes, and
understand/learn visual cues, called visual affordances, for affordance

we introduce a large scale multi-view RGBD visual affordance learning dataset,
a benchmark of 47210 RGBD images from 37 object categories, annotated with 15
visual affordance categories and 35 cluttered/complex scenes with different
objects and multiple affordances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first ever and the largest multi-view RGBD visual affordance learning dataset.
We benchmark the proposed dataset for affordance recognition and segmentation.
To achieve this we propose an Affordance Recognition Network a.k.a ARNet. In
addition, four state-of-the-art deep learning networks are evaluated for

computing, leveraging devices' distributed computing capabilities. However,
applying FL in practice is challenging due to the local devices' heterogeneous
energy, wireless channel conditions, and non-independently and identically
distributed (non-IID) data distributions. To cope with these issues, this paper
proposes a novel learning framework by integrating FL and width-adjustable
slimmable neural networks (SNN). Integrating FL with SNNs is challenging due to
time-varying channel conditions and data distributions. In addition, existing
multi-width SNN training algorithms are sensitive to the data distributions
across devices, which makes SNN ill-suited for FL. Motivated by this, we
propose a communication and energy-efficient SNN-based FL (named SlimFL) that
jointly utilizes superposition coding (SC) for global model aggregation and
superposition training (ST) for updating local models. By applying SC, SlimFL
exchanges the superposition of multiple-width configurations decoded as many
times as possible for a given communication throughput. Leveraging ST, SlimFL
aligns the forward propagation of different width configurations while avoiding
inter-width interference during backpropagation. We formally prove the
convergence of SlimFL. The result reveals that SlimFL is not only
communication-efficient but also deals with non-IID data distributions and poor
channel conditions, which is also corroborated by data-intensive simulations.

relativistic hydrodynamic simulations spanning a wide range of engine
luminosities and opening angles. We explore AGN jet propagation with different
ambient density profiles, including $r^{-2}$ (self-similar solution) and
$r^{-1}$, which is more relevant for AGN host environments. The Fanaroff-Riley
(FR) morphological dichotomy arises naturally in our models. Jets with low
energy density compared to the ambient medium produce a center-brightened
emissivity distribution, while emissivity from relatively higher energy density
jets is dominated by a terminal bright spot. We observe recollimation shocks in
our simulations that can generate bright spots along the spine of the jet,
providing a possible explanation for ""knots"" observed in AGN jets. We
additionally find a scaling relation between the number of knots and the
jet-head-to-surroundings energy density ratio. This scaling relation is
generally consistent with the observations of the jets in M87 and Cygnus A. Our
model also correctly predicts M87 as FR I and Cygnus A as FR II. Our model can
be used to relate jet dynamical parameters such as jet head velocity, jet
opening angle, and external pressure to jet power and ambient density

forgetting, i.e. the tendency of neural networks to fail to preserve the
knowledge acquired from old tasks when learning new tasks. This problem has
been widely investigated in the research community and several Incremental
Learning (IL) approaches have been proposed in the past years. While earlier
works in computer vision have mostly focused on image classification and object
detection, more recently some IL approaches for semantic segmentation have been
introduced. These previous works showed that, despite its simplicity, knowledge
distillation can be effectively employed to alleviate catastrophic forgetting.
In this paper, we follow this research direction and, inspired by recent
literature on contrastive learning, we propose a novel distillation framework,
Uncertainty-aware Contrastive Distillation (\method). In a nutshell, \method~is
operated by introducing a novel distillation loss that takes into account all
the images in a mini-batch, enforcing similarity between features associated to
all the pixels from the same classes, and pulling apart those corresponding to
pixels from different classes. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we
contrast features of the new model with features extracted by a frozen model
learned at the previous incremental step. Our experimental results demonstrate
the advantage of the proposed distillation technique, which can be used in
synergy with previous IL approaches, and leads to state-of-art performance on
three commonly adopted benchmarks for incremental semantic segmentation. The

presented in a phase diagram spanned by two tuning parameters. We demonstrate
that in 1-d disordered driven GEM, three qualitatively different behavior
regimes are possible with a proper specification of the order parameter (mean

steady-state order parameter approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit. A
system with a non-zero mean velocity can be in either the continuous regime,

Additive Regression Trees) are popular Bayesian regression models widely
applicable in modern regression problems. Their popularity is intimately tied
to the ability to flexibly model complex responses depending on
high-dimensional inputs while simultaneously being able to quantify
uncertainties. This ability to quantify uncertainties is key, as it allows
researchers to perform appropriate inferential analyses in settings that have
generally been too difficult to handle using the Bayesian approach. However,
surprisingly little work has been done to evaluate the sensitivity of these
modern regression models to violations of modeling assumptions. In particular,
we will consider influential observations, which one reasonably would imagine
to be common -- or at least a concern -- in the big-data setting. In this
paper, we consider both the problem of detecting influential observations and
adjusting predictions to not be unduly affected by such potentially problematic
data. We consider three detection diagnostics for Bayesian tree models, one an
analogue of Cook's distance and the others taking the form of a divergence
measure and a conditional predictive density metric, and then propose an
importance sampling algorithm to re-weight previously sampled posterior draws
so as to remove the effects of influential data in a computationally efficient
manner. Finally, our methods are demonstrated on real-world data where blind
application of the models can lead to poor predictions and inference.

single actions. However, they fail to fully reason about the contextual
relations between adjacent actions, which provide potential temporal logic for
understanding long videos. In this paper, we propose a prompt-based framework,
Bridge-Prompt (Br-Prompt), to model the semantics across adjacent actions, so
that it simultaneously exploits both out-of-context and contextual information
from a series of ordinal actions in instructional videos. More specifically, we
reformulate the individual action labels as integrated text prompts for
supervision, which bridge the gap between individual action semantics. The
generated text prompts are paired with corresponding video clips, and together
co-train the text encoder and the video encoder via a contrastive approach. The
learned vision encoder has a stronger capability for ordinal-action-related
downstream tasks, e.g. action segmentation and human activity recognition. We
evaluate the performances of our approach on several video datasets: Georgia

The common
assumption in studying the properties of the neutron star crust is the fully
accreted crust approximation. However, observations of some X-ray transient
sources indicate that the original crust has not been completely replaced by
accreted material, but is partly composed of the compressed original crust. A
two-part (or hybrid) crust made of the original crust that is compressed and of
the accreted material crashing onto it was reconstructed as a function of the
accretion stage. The differences in the composition and energy sources for the
fully accreted and hybrid crusts influence the cooling and transport
properties. A simple semi-empirical formula of a compressible liquid drop was
used. We compared the nuclear reactions triggered by compression in the
original crust and in the accreted matter part of the hybrid crust. We discuss
another crust compression astrophysical phenomenon related to spinning neutron
stars. The compression of the originally catalyzed outer crust triggers
exothermic reactions (electron captures and pycnonuclear fusions) that deposit
heat in the crust. The heat sources are cataloged as a function of the
compression until the fully accreted crust approximation is reached. The
pressure at which neutron drip occurs is a nonmonotonic function of the depth,
leading to a temporary neutron drip anomaly. The additional potential source of
energy for partially accreted crusts is the occurrence of a density inversion
phenomenon between some compressed layers. The original crust of a neutron star
cannot be neglected when the original crust is not fully replaced by the
accreted matter. The amount of heat associated with the compression of the
original crust is on the same order of magnitude as that from the sources
acting in the accreted part of the hybrid crust.

of a deep learning model to perform this task requires a large number of
training images to represent the rapid development of the transient fetal brain
structures. On the other hand, manual multi-label segmentation of a large
number of 3D images is prohibitive. To address this challenge, we segmented 272
training images, covering 19-39 gestational weeks, using an automatic
multi-atlas segmentation strategy based on deformable registration and
probabilistic atlas fusion, and manually corrected large errors in those
segmentations. Since this process generated a large training dataset with noisy
segmentations, we developed a novel label smoothing procedure and a loss
function to train a deep learning model with smoothed noisy segmentations. Our
proposed methods properly account for the uncertainty in tissue boundaries. We
evaluated our method on 23 manually-segmented test images of a separate set of
fetuses. Results show that our method achieves an average Dice similarity

older fetuses, respectively. Our method generated results that were
significantly more accurate than several state-of-the-art methods including
nnU-Net that achieved the closest results to our method. Our trained model can
serve as a valuable tool to enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of fetal

joint inferential problem on multiple populations, each corresponding to a
different hypertensive disorder diagnosis, that combines multivariate
information provided by a collection of cardiac function indexes. A Bayesian
nonparametric approach seems particularly suited for this setup and we
demonstrate it on a dataset consisting of transthoracic echocardiography

to single out modified cardiac functions in hypertensive patients compared to
healthy subjects and progressively increased alterations with the severity of
the disorder. The analysis is based on a Bayesian nonparametric model that
relies on a novel hierarchical structure, called symmetric hierarchical
Dirichlet process. This is suitably designed so that the mean parameters are
identified and used for model selection across populations, a penalization for
multiplicity is enforced, and the presence of unobserved relevant factors is
investigated through a latent clustering of subjects. Posterior inference
relies on a suitable Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and the model behaviour
is also showcased on simulated data.

which points to cultural foundations. Furthermore, even if its foundation was
biological, kinship is often too imprecise to track genetic relatedness
efficiently, while inclusive fitness theory would suggest focusing only on the
closest relatives, which is not the case in most human cultures. It was the
parallel validity of these contradicting arguments that led to decades of
fierce debate about the definition and measurement of the phenomenon. This
paper offers a new approach to kinship. First, the model demonstrates that it
is possible to generate kinship networks (a) derived from the kind of basic kin
connections that our species shares with other apes, but (b) driven by network
rather than biological logic beyond the immediate family. Second the model
demonstrates that kinship as a network heuristic works efficiently only in high
fertility societies, and gives way to similarity-based friendship with
demographic transition. The results explain (i) why kinship labelling is unique
to our species, (ii) why kinship is universal among human cultures, (iii) why
kinship terminology systems are varied across cultures, (iv) why linguistic kin
assignment is imprecise, and (v) why kinship is replaced by homophily when

from over 50 fragment-screening campaigns to introduce two important elements
that we believe are absent in most -- if not all -- ML studies of this type
reported to date: First, alongside the observed hits we use to train our
models, we incorporate true misses and show that these experimentally validated
negative data are of significant importance to the quality of the derived

representation of what the ML model considers important for successful binding.
This representation is derived from a straightforward attribution procedure
that explains the prediction in terms of the (inter-)action of chemical
environments. Critically, we validate the attribution outcome on a large scale
against prior annotations made independently by expert molecular modellers. We
find good agreement between the key molecular substructures proposed by the ML
model and those assigned manually, even when the model's performance in
discriminating hits from misses is far from perfect. By projecting the
attribution onto predefined interaction prototypes (pharmacophores), we show

  Clinical Text Data","38 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, arxiv pre-print",,,,"cs.CL stat.AP stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objective: To comparatively evaluate several transformer model architectures
at identifying protected health information (PHI) in the i2b2/UTHealth 2014
clinical text de-identification challenge corpus.
  Methods: The i2b2/UTHealth 2014 corpus contains N=1304 clinical notes
obtained from N=296 patients. Using a transfer learning framework, we fine-tune
several transformer model architectures on the corpus, including: BERT-base,
BERT-large, ROBERTA-base, ROBERTA-large, ALBERT-base and ALBERT-xxlarge. During
fine-tuning we vary the following model hyper-parameters: batch size, number
training epochs, learning rate and weight decay. We fine tune models on a
training data set, we evaluate and select optimally performing models on an
independent validation dataset, and lastly assess generalization performance on
a held-out test dataset. We assess model performance in terms of accuracy,
precision (positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity) and F1 score
(harmonic mean of precision and recall). We are interested in overall model
performance (PHI identified vs. PHI not identified), as well as PHI-specific
model performance.
  Results: We observe that the ROBERTA-large models perform best at identifying
PHI in the i2b2/UTHealth 2014 corpus, achieving >99% overall accuracy and 96.7%
recall/precision on the heldout test corpus. Performance was good across many
PHI classes; however, accuracy/precision/recall decreased for identification of
the following entity classes: professions, organizations, ages, and certain
locations.
  Conclusions: Transformers are a promising model class/architecture for
clinical text de-identification. With minimal hyper-parameter tuning
transformers afford researchers/clinicians the opportunity to obtain (near)
state-of-the-art performance.

and data processing requirement. Large power consumption and hardware overhead
have become the main challenges for building next-generation AI hardware. To
mitigate this, Neuromorphic computing has drawn immense attention due to its
excellent capability for data processing with very low power consumption. While
relentless research has been underway for years to minimize the power
consumption in neuromorphic hardware, we are still a long way off from reaching
the energy efficiency of the human brain. Furthermore, design complexity and
process variation hinder the large-scale implementation of current neuromorphic
platforms. Recently, the concept of implementing neuromorphic computing systems
in cryogenic temperature has garnered intense interest thanks to their
excellent speed and power metric. Several cryogenic devices can be engineered
to work as neuromorphic primitives with ultra-low demand for power. Here we
comprehensively review the cryogenic neuromorphic hardware. We classify the
existing cryogenic neuromorphic hardware into several hierarchical categories
and sketch a comparative analysis based on key performance metrics. Our
analysis concisely describes the operation of the associated circuit topology
and outlines the advantages and challenges encountered by the state-of-the-art
technology platforms. Finally, we provide insights to circumvent these
challenges for the future progression of research.

trolling or malicious content targeting users or communities. One way of
trolling users is by creating memes, which in most cases unites an image with a
short piece of text embedded on top of it. The situation is more complex for
multilingual(e.g., Tamil) memes due to the lack of benchmark datasets and
models. We explore several models to detect Troll memes in Tamil based on the
shared task, ""Troll Meme Classification in DravidianLangTech2022"" at ACL-2022.
We observe while the text-based model MURIL performs better for Non-troll meme
classification, the image-based model VGG16 performs better for Troll-meme
classification. Further fusing these two modalities help us achieve stable
outcomes in both classes. Our fusion model achieved a 0.561 weighted average F1
score and ranked second in this task.

  Human Activity Recognition",,,,,"eess.SP cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There is an increasing demand for intelligent processing on emerging
ultra-low-power internet of things (IoT) devices, and recent works have shown
substantial efficiency boosts by executing inference tasks directly on the IoT
device (node) rather than merely transmitting sensor data. However, the
computation and power demands of Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based inference pose
significant challenges for nodes in an energy-harvesting wireless sensor
network (EH-WSN). Moreover, these tasks often require responses from multiple
physically distributed EH sensor nodes, which imposes crucial system
optimization challenges in addition to per-node constraints.
  To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Seeker}, a novel approach to
efficiently execute DNN inferences for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks,
using both an EH-WSN and a host mobile device. Seeker minimizes communication
overheads and maximizes computation at each sensor without violating the
quality of service. \emph{Seeker} uses a \emph{store-and-execute} approach to
complete a subset of inferences on the EH sensor node, reducing communication
with the mobile host. Further, for those inferences unfinished because of
harvested energy constraints, it leverages an \emph{activity aware coreset}
(AAC) construction to efficiently communicate compact features to the host
device where ensemble techniques are used to efficiently finish the inferences.
\emph{Seeker} performs HAR with $86.8\%$ accuracy, surpassing the $81.2\%$
accuracy of a state of the art approach. Moreover, by using AAC, it lowers the
communication data volume by $8.9\times$.

in many complex correlated systems, the heterogeneity of spatial ordering and

the structure and function relation in quantum complex materials. We focus here
on the spatial heterogeneity of the motion of charge density wave (CDW) at
nanoscale in the archetypal case of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_{4+y}$ perovskite at
low temperature. We report compelling evidence that the unconventional
increasing motion of CDW at T < 50K is related with the decreasing of its
correlation length using resonant soft X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy
(XPCS). The key result of this work is the direct visualization of nanoscale
spatial inhomogeneity of CDW relaxation dynamics by scanning micro X-ray
diffraction (SmXRD) showing a nanoscale landscape of percolating short range
dynamic CDW puddles competing with large quasi-static CDW puddles giving rise
to a novel form of nanoscale phase separation of the incommensurate stripes
