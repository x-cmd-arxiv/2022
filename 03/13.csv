can have stronger problem-specific performance? In this paper, we draw
inspiration from the field of ""learning to optimize"" to use a learnable

Then, in order to reduce variance of the amalgamation process, we also explore
methods to stabilize the amalgamation process by perturbing the amalgamation

being measured up to the unprecedented per cent precision level. The
logarithmic slope of these fluxes is a crucial quantity that promises us
information on the diffusion properties and the primary or secondary nature of
the different species. However, these measured slopes are sometimes interpreted
in the pure diffusive regime, guiding to misleading conclusions. In this paper,
we have studied the propagation of galactic cosmic rays by computing the fluxes
of species between H and Fe using the USINE code and considering all the
relevant physical processes and an updated set of cross-section data. We show
that the slope of the well-studied secondary-to-primary B/C ratio is distinctly
different from the diffusion coefficient slope, by an offset of about 0.2 in
the rigidity range in which the AMS-02 data reach their best precision (several
tens of GV).
  Furthermore, we have demonstrated that none of the species from H to Fe
follows the expectations of the pure-diffusive regime. We argue that these
differences arise from propagation processes such as fragmentation, convection,
and reacceleration, which cannot be neglected. On this basis, we also provide
predictions for the spectral slope of elemental fluxes not yet analysed by the

that GATSBI can return well-calibrated posterior estimates even in high

given an implicit prior, and performs better than a state-of-the-art SBI

posterior estimation to focus on individual observations. Overall, GATSBI opens
up opportunities for leveraging advances in GANs to perform Bayesian inference

approaches to explore an unknown asteroid with onboard calculations, and to
land on its surface area selected in an optimal fashion. The main motivation is
to avoid the extended period of mapping or preliminary ground observations that
are commonly required in spacecraft missions around asteroids. First, range
measurements from the spacecraft to the surface are used to incrementally
correct an initial shape estimate according to the Bayesian framework. Then, an
optimal guidance scheme is proposed to control the vantage point of the range
sensor to construct a complete 3D model of the asteroid shape. This shape model
is then used in a nonlinear controller to track a desired trajectory about the
asteroid. Finally, a multi resolution approach is presented to construct a
higher fidelity shape representation in a specified location while avoiding the
inherent burdens of a uniformly high resolution mesh. This approach enables for
an accurate shape determination around a potential landing site. We demonstrate
this approach using several radar shape models of asteroids and provide a full

instabilities in an incompressible annular hyperelastic plate. The governing
differential equations for a two-dimensional plate system are derived using a
variational principle with no apriori kinematic assumptions in the thickness
direction. A linear bifurcation analysis is performed to investigate the
stability behaviour of the growing hyperelastic annular plate by considering
both axisymmetric and asymmetric perturbations. The resulting differential
equations are then solved numerically using the compound matrix method to

for image transmission is proposed so as to minimize the distortion and the
transmission rate. A mathematically tractable lower bound on the proposed
objective is derived, and then, adopted as the loss function of AIB-JSCC. To
trade off compression and reconstruction quality, an adaptive algorithm is
proposed to adjust the hyperparameter of the proposed loss function dynamically
according to the distortion during the training. Experimental results show that
AIB-JSCC can significantly reduce the required amount of transmitted data and
improve the reconstruction quality and downstream task accuracy.

testing procedure for the conditional independence hypothesis: X is independent
of Y conditioning on Z. Though having many attractive properties, the model-X
CRT relies on the model-X assumption that we have perfect knowledge of the
distribution of X | Z. If there is an error in modeling the distribution of X |
Z, this approach may lose its validity. This problem is even more severe when
the adjustment covariates Z are of high dimensionality, in which situation
precise modeling of X against Z can be hard. In response to this, we propose
the Maxway (Model and Adjust X With the Assistance of Y) CRT, which learns the
distribution of Y | Z, and uses it to calibrate the resampling distribution of
X to gain robustness to the error in modeling X. We prove that the type-I error
inflation of the Maxway CRT can be controlled by the learning error for the
low-dimensional adjusting model plus the product of learning errors for X | Z
and Y | Z, which could be interpreted as an ""almost doubly robust"" property.
Based on this, we develop implementing algorithms of the Maxway CRT in
practical scenarios including (surrogate-assisted) semi-supervised learning and
transfer learning where valid information about Y | Z can be potentially
provided by some auxiliary or external data. Through extensive simulation
studies under different scenarios, we demonstrate that the Maxway CRT achieves
significantly better type-I error control than existing model-X inference
approaches while preserving similar powers. Finally, we apply our methodology
to two real examples, including (1) studying obesity paradox with electronic
health record (EHR) data assisted by surrogate variables; (2) inferring the
side effect of statins among the ethnic minority group via transferring

contribute a comparative analysis of concerns about inductive learning that
arise in causal attribution as exemplified in psychology versus predictive

cracks in long-held beliefs that optimizing predictive accuracy using huge

risks that arise when sources of errors are misdiagnosed and the need to

secured the fact that neutron stars (NSs) with super-strong magnetic fields are

leading mechanisms to explain the origin of such coherent radio emission is the
curvature radiation process within the dipolar magnetic field structure. It
has, however, already been demonstrated that magnetars likely have a more
complex magnetic field topology. Here we critically investigate curvature radio
emission in the presence of inclined dipolar and quadrupolar (""quadrudipolar"")
magnetic fields and show that such field structures differ in their angular
characteristics from a purely dipolar case. We analytically show that the shape
of open field lines can be modified significantly depending on both the ratio
of quadrupole to dipole field strength and their inclination angle at the NS
surface. This creates multiple points along each magnetic field line that
coincides with the observer's line of sight and may explain the complex
spectral and temporal structure of the observed FRBs. We also find that in
quadrudipole, the radio beam can take a wider angular range and the beam width
can be wider than in pure dipole. This may explain why the pulse width of the
transient radio pulsation from magnetars is as large as that of ordinary radio
pulsars.

computational cost as well as the heterogeneous community structure. Stochastic
block model (SBM) is a popular model to analyze community structure where nodes
belonging to the same communities are connected with equal probability.
Modularity optimization methods provide a fast and effective way for community
detection under SBM with assortative community structure, where nodes within
communities are densely connected and nodes across communities are relatively
loosely connected. However, the non-assortative community structure, where
nodes across communities are densely connected, widely exists in real-world
networks, thus leading to the inconsistency of modularity optimization methods
in applications. In this paper, we consider networks with ""grouped communities""
(or ""the group structure""), where nodes within grouped communities are densely
connected and nodes across grouped communities are relatively loosely
connected, while nodes belonging to the same group but different communities
can be either densely or loosely connected. We incorporate the group structure
in the SBM and propose a novel divide-and-conquer algorithm to detect the
community structure. We show that the proposed method can recover both the
group structure and the community structure asymptotically. Numerical studies
demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the computational cost
significantly while still achieving competitive performance. Further, we extend
the proposed framework from the SBM to the degree-corrected SBM for more
general applications.

twisted bilayer graphene, the torsional PLD begins to form at angles below
3.89{\deg} and the amplitude reaches 8 pm around the magic angle of 1.1{\deg}.
At extremely low twist angles (e.g. below 0.25{\deg}) the amplitude increases

cornerstone of intelligence. Despite their phenomenal performance in a wide
variety of applications, deep neural networks are prone to forgetting their
previously learned information upon learning new ones. This phenomenon is
called ""catastrophic forgetting"" and is deeply rooted in the
stability-plasticity dilemma. Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in deep neural
networks has become an active field of research in recent years. In particular,
gradient projection-based methods have recently shown exceptional performance
at overcoming catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes two
biologically-inspired mechanisms based on sparsity and heterogeneous dropout
that significantly increase a continual learner's performance over a long
sequence of tasks. Our proposed approach builds on the Gradient Projection
Memory (GPM) framework. We leverage k-winner activations in each layer of a
neural network to enforce layer-wise sparse activations for each task, together
with a between-task heterogeneous dropout that encourages the network to use
non-overlapping activation patterns between different tasks. In addition, we
introduce two new benchmarks for continual learning under distributional shift,
namely Continual Swiss Roll and ImageNet SuperDog-40. Lastly, we provide an
in-depth analysis of our proposed method and demonstrate a significant

constraint. When a boundary is present, one of the topological terms in the

at the edge. Our work finds that the anomaly inflow mechanism is not compatible
with the no-slip condition, in which the fluid adheres to the wall, but is
consistent with the no-stress condition, in which the fluid can move along the
wall without friction. This results in gauge anomaly giving rise to tangential
forces on the boundary that can be balanced by fluid stresses. Additionally,
our work explains how to derive this modified no-stress boundary condition
within a variational principle by including a chiral boson action at the

that this hydrodynamic theory with boundary is dual to the

viscoelastic regimes during the pinch-off of droplets of dilute polymer

of a drop from a nozzle is associated with the formation of a liquid neck that
causes the divergence of the local stress in a vanishingly small region. If the
liquid is a polymer solution, this increasing stress progressively unwinds the
polymer chains, up to a point where the resulting increase in the viscosity
slows down drastically the thinning. This threshold to a viscoelastic behavior
corresponds to a macroscopic strain rate $\dot{\varepsilon}_{\rm c}$. In the
present study, we characterize the variations of $\dot{\varepsilon}_{\rm c}$
with respect to the polymer concentration and molar weight, to the solvent
viscosity, and to the nozzle size, i.e., the weight of the drop. We provide
empirical scaling laws for these variations. We also analyze the thinning
dynamics at the transition and show that it follows a self-similar dynamics
controlled by the time scale ${\dot{\varepsilon}_{\rm c}}^{-1}$. This
characteristic time is different and always shorter than the relaxation time of

including Higgs couplings determinations at the sub percent level, precision
tests of the weak and strong forces, and searches for new particles, including
dark matter, both directly and via virtual corrections or mixing. Among other
possibilities, the FCC-ee will be able to (i) indirectly discover new particles

resolution. These features make MPGD one of the primary choices as precise muon
tracking and trigger system in general-purpose detectors at future HEP
colliders. In addition, the low material budget and the flexibility of the base
material make MPGDs suitable for the development of very light, full
cylindrical fine tracking inner trackers at lepton colliders. On-going R&Ds aim
at pushing the detector performance at the limits of each technology. We are
working in continuing to consolidate the construction and stable operation of
large-size detectors, able to cope with large particle fluxes. In this white
paper, we describe some of the most prominent MPGD technologies, their

prohibitive, since it involves a complex cardiovascular fluid-structure
interaction (FSI) problem with a characteristic time scale of milliseconds to

equations, which takes place over several months. In this work we combine a
temporal homogenization approach, which separates the problem in
computationally expensive FSI problems on a micro scale and a
reaction-diffusion problem on the macro scale, with parallel time-stepping
algorithms. It has been found in the literature that parallel time-stepping
algorithms do not perform well when applied directly to the FSI problem. To
circumvent this problem, a parareal algorithm is applied on the macro-scale
reaction-diffusion problem instead of the micro-scale FSI problem. We
investigate modifications in the coarse propagator of the parareal algorithm,
in order to further reduce the number of costly micro problems to be solved.
The approaches are tested in detailed numerical investigations based on serial

models for sequential data analysis, and it has been successfully applied in a
large variety of domains. One of the key reasons for this versatility is the
ability of HMMs to deal with missing data. However, standard HMM learning
algorithms rely crucially on the assumption that the positions of the missing
observations within the observation sequence are known. In some situations
where such assumptions are not feasible, a number of special algorithms have
been developed. Currently, these algorithms rely strongly on specific
structural assumptions of the underlying chain, such as acyclicity, and are not
applicable in the general case. In particular, there are numerous domains
within medicine and computational biology, where the missing observation
locations are unknown and acyclicity assumptions do not hold, thus presenting a
barrier for the application of HMMs in those fields. In this paper we consider
a general problem of learning HMMs from data with unknown missing observation
locations (i.e., only the order of the non-missing observations are known). We
introduce a generative model of the location omissions and propose two learning
methods for this model, a (semi) analytic approach, and a Gibbs sampler. We
evaluate and compare the algorithms in a variety of scenarios, measuring their
reconstruction precision and robustness under model misspecification.

behavior of proteins in solution versus in the crystalline state. Here, we
compare the properties of the hydrophobic cores of high-resolution protein
crystal structures and those in NMR structures, determined using increasing
numbers and types of restraints. Prior studies have reported that many NMR
structures have denser cores compared to those of high-resolution x-ray crystal
structures. Our current work investigates this result in more detail, and finds
that these NMR structures tend to violate basic features of protein
stereochemistry, such as small non-bonded atomic overlaps and few Ramachandran
and side chain dihedral angle outliers. We find that NMR structures solved with
more restraints, and which do not significantly violate stereochemistry, have
hydrophobic cores that have a similar size and packing fraction as their
counterparts determined by x-ray crystallography at high-resolution. These
results lead us to conclude that, at least regarding the core packing
properties, high-quality structures determined by NMR and x-ray crystallography
are the same, and the differences reported earlier are most likely a
consequence of methodology, rather than fundamental differences between the
protein in the two different environments.

magnetoresistance exhibits two pairs of symmetrical sharp valleys with an
angular difference close to the angle between the crystal planes (001) and

reversible dynamics are obtained from a free energy that describes both a
finitely-extensible conformation tensor and an ideal gas of entanglements along
the chain. The dissipative dynamics give rise to coupled kinetic equations for
the conformation tensor and entanglements, whose coupling terms describe
shear-induced disentanglement. The relaxation dynamics of the conformation
tensor follow the GLaMM and Rolie-Poly models, and account for reptation,
retraction and CCR. We propose that the relaxation time $\tau_\nu$ for
entanglement recovery is proportional to the Rouse time $\tau_R$ which governs
polymer stretch within the tube. This which matches recent molecular dynamics
simulations, and corresponds to relaxing the entanglement number before the

These events require individual black hole masses that fall within the pair
instability supernova mass gap, and therefore these black holes may have been
grown from hierarchical mergers. AGN disks are a prime environment for
hierarchical mergers, and thus a potential location for the progenitors of BBH
gravitational wave events. Understanding how a BBH embedded in an AGN disk
interacts with the surrounding environment is thus crucial for determining if
this interaction can lead to its merger. However, there are few high fidelity
simulations of this process, and almost all are two-dimensional. We present the
results from 3D, high-resolution, local shearing-box simulations of an embedded
BBH interacting with an AGN disk. In these first simulations of their kind, we
focus on determining the mass accretion rate and the orbital evolution rate at
different BBH separations. We find that circular, equal-mass BBHs with
separations greater than 10% of their Hill radius contract while accreting at a
super-Eddington rate. At smaller separations, however, our 3D simulations find
that BBHs expand their orbits. This result suggests that it may be difficult
for an AGN disk to push a BBH to merger, but we discuss several mechanisms,
including MHD turbulence and radiative and mechanical feedback, that could
alleviate this difficulty.

solubility is identified as the solution's salt concentration, where the energy
of the ion pair dissolved in solution equals the energy of the ion pair
crystallized at the kink sites. The simulation methodology is demonstrated for
the case of anhydrous sodium acetate crystallized from various
solvent-antisolvent mixtures. To validate the predicted solubilities, we have
measured the solubilities of sodium acetate in-house, using an experimental
setup and measurement protocol that guarantees moisture-free conditions, which
is key for a hygroscopic compound like sodium acetate. We observe excellent
agreement between the experimental and the computationally evaluated
solubilities for sodium acetate in different solvent-antisolvent mixtures.
Given the agreement and the rich data the simulations produce, we can use them
to complement experimental tasks which in turn will reduce time and capital in
the design of complicated industrial crystallization processes of organic

persistence and communication capabilities of the robots. Despite their
differences, they all always assume that robots have unlimited amounts of
energy.
  In this paper, we remove this assumption and start the study of the
computational capabilities of robots whose energy is limited, albeit renewable.
We first study the impact that memory persistence and communication
capabilities have on the computational power of such energy-constrained systems
of robots; we do so by analyzing the computational relationship between the
four models under this energy constraint. We provide a complete
characterization of this relationship.
  We then study the difference in computational power caused by the energy
restriction and provide a complete characterization of the relationship between
energy-constrained and unrestricted robots in each model. We prove that within
LUMI there is no difference; an integral part of the proof is the design and
analysis of an algorithm that in LUMI allows energy-constrained robots to
execute correctly any protocol for robots with unlimited energy. We then show
the (apparently counterintuitive) result that in all other models, the energy
constraint actually provides the robots with a computational advantage.

teaching an autonomous agent to imitate user mobility based on the user's

mimic the user behavior patterns. The profiling framework is formulated into a
reinforcement learning task, where an agent is a next-visit planner, an action
is a POI that a user will visit next, and the state of the environment is a
fused representation of a user and spatial entities. An event in which a user
visits a POI will construct a new state, which helps the agent predict users'
mobility more accurately. In the framework, we introduce a spatial Knowledge

entities. Additionally, we develop a mutual-updating strategy to quantify the

imitative graph learning framework for mobile user profiling. Finally, we
conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

records, used to train a target model, using only the model's output. In
launching a contemporary model inversion attack, the strategies discussed are
generally based on either predicted confidence score vectors, i.e., black-box
attacks, or the parameters of a target model, i.e., white-box attacks. However,
in the real world, model owners usually only give out the predicted labels; the
confidence score vectors and model parameters are hidden as a defense mechanism
to prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, we have found a model inversion method
that can reconstruct the input data records based only on the output labels. We
believe this is the attack that requires the least information to succeed and,
therefore, has the best applicability. The key idea is to exploit the error
rate of the target model to compute the median distance from a set of data
records to the decision boundary of the target model. The distance, then, is
used to generate confidence score vectors which are adopted to train an attack
model to reconstruct the data records. The experimental results show that
highly recognizable data records can be reconstructed with far less information

makes it ideal to simulate fracture scenarios that involve extreme

ad-hoc empirical local damage models, cohesive zone approaches, or
pseudo-spring models, which come with a set of drawbacks and limitations. On
the other hand, phase field models of brittle fracture have recently gained
popularity in academic circles and provide significant improvements compared to
previous approaches. These improvements include the derivation from fundamental
fracture theories, the introduction of non-locality, and the ability to model
multiple crack initiation, propagation, branching, and coalescence, in
situations where no prior knowledge of the crack paths is available.

paper, we consider the black-box adversarial setting, where the adversary needs
to craft adversarial examples without access to the gradients of a target
model. Previous methods attempted to approximate the true gradient either by
using the transfer gradient of a surrogate white-box model or based on the
feedback of model queries. However, the existing methods inevitably suffer from
low attack success rates or poor query efficiency since it is difficult to
estimate the gradient in a high-dimensional input space with limited
information. To address these problems and improve black-box attacks, we
propose two prior-guided random gradient-free (PRGF) algorithms based on biased
sampling and gradient averaging, respectively. Our methods can take the
advantage of a transfer-based prior given by the gradient of a surrogate model
and the query information simultaneously. Through theoretical analyses, the
transfer-based prior is appropriately integrated with model queries by an
optimal coefficient in each method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in
comparison with the alternative state-of-the-arts, both of our methods require
much fewer queries to attack black-box models with higher success rates.

identify active reconnection sites under complex varied conditions, including
asymmetric and turbulent upstream conditions. It also provides a higher rate of
identification than plasma outflow jets alone. MFT can be applied to in situ

Inherent in traditional methods for quantifying and monitoring hurricane
preparedness are significant lags. This study establishes a methodological
framework to quantify the extent, timing, and spatial variation of hurricane
preparedness at the CBG level using high-resolution location intelligence data.
Anonymized cell phone data on visits to POIs for each CBG before 2017 Hurricane
Harvey were used to examine hurricane preparedness. Four categories of POI,
grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies and home improvement stores, were
identified as having close relationship with hurricane preparedness, and the
daily number of visits from each CBG to these four categories of POIs were
calculated during preparation period. Two metrics, extent of preparedness and
proactivity, were calculated based on the daily visit percentage change
compared to the baseline period. The results show that peak visits to
pharmacies often occurred in the early stage, whereas the peak of visits to gas
stations happened closer to landfall. The spatial and temporal patterns of
visits to grocery stores and home improvement stores were quite similar.
However, correlation analysis demonstrates that extent of preparedness and
proactivity are independent of each other. Combined with synchronous evacuation
data, CBGs were divided into four clusters in terms of extent of preparedness
and evacuation rate. The clusters with low preparedness and low evacuation rate
were identified as hotspots of vulnerability for shelter-in-place households
that would need urgent attention during response. The study advances
data-driven understanding of human protective actions and provide emergency
response managers with novel insights to proactively monitor disaster
preparedness, facilitating identifying under-prepared areas and better
allocating resources timely.

  without Accessing It",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transfer learning is an important approach that produces pre-trained teacher
models which can be used to quickly build specialized student models. However,
recent research on transfer learning has found that it is vulnerable to various
attacks, e.g., misclassification and backdoor attacks. However, it is still not
clear whether transfer learning is vulnerable to model inversion attacks.
Launching a model inversion attack against transfer learning scheme is
challenging. Not only does the student model hide its structural parameters,
but it is also inaccessible to the adversary. Hence, when targeting a student
model, both the white-box and black-box versions of existing model inversion
attacks fail. White-box attacks fail as they need the target model's
parameters. Black-box attacks fail as they depend on making repeated queries of
the target model. However, they may not mean that transfer learning models are
impervious to model inversion attacks. Hence, with this paper, we initiate
research into model inversion attacks against transfer learning schemes with
two novel attack methods. Both are black-box attacks, suiting different
situations, that do not rely on queries to the target student model. In the
first method, the adversary has the data samples that share the same
distribution as the training set of the teacher model. In the second method,
the adversary does not have any such samples. Experiments show that highly
recognizable data records can be recovered with both of these methods. This
means that even if a model is an inaccessible black-box, it can still be
inverted.

technique, has been used to analyze high-dimensional data in many areas. It
discovers the homogeneity within the data and creates a reduced feature space

the presence of a group structure of the data, PCA often fails to identify the
group-specific pattern, which is known as sub-homogeneity in this study.
Group-specific information that is missed can result in an unsatisfactory
representation of the data from a particular group. It is important to capture
both homogeneity and sub-homogeneity in high-dimensional data analysis, but
this poses a great challenge. In this study, we propose a novel iterative
complement-clustering principal component analysis (CPCA) to iteratively
estimate the homogeneity and sub-homogeneity. A principal component regression

maximizing the worst-case accuracy is more important than maximizing the

bias-variance tradeoff perspective to implicitly reach this goal: a simple yet
effective stability regularization (SR) loss together with model ensemble to
reduce variance during fine-tuning, and an adaptability calibration mechanism
to reduce the bias. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the

recombination in more details, we find that the original work significantly

states of a quantum computer: because there is an energy gap to excitations,
there are no spurious modes with which the qubits can interact, causing
irreversible decay of the quantum state. As a practical matter, however, there
exists a high density of excitations out of the superconducting ground state
even at ultralow temperature; these are known as quasiparticles. Observed
quasiparticle densities are of order 1~$\mu$m$^{-3}$, tens of orders of
magnitude larger than the equilibrium density expected from theory.
Nonequilibrium quasiparticles extract energy from the qubit mode and induce
discrete changes in qubit offset charge, a potential source of dephasing. Here
we show that a dominant mechanism for quasiparticle poisoning in
superconducting qubits is direct absorption of high-energy photons at the qubit
junction. We use a Josephson junction-based photon source to controllably dose
qubit circuits with millimeter-wave radiation, and we use an interferometric
quantum gate sequence to reconstruct the charge parity on the qubit island. We
find that the structure of the qubit itself acts as a resonant antenna for
millimeter-wave radiation, providing an efficient path for photons to generate
quasiparticle excitations. A deep understanding of this physics will pave the
way to realization of next-generation superconducting qubits that are robust
against quasiparticle poisoning and could enable a new class of quantum sensors

an adversary attempts to infer a data record's membership in a dataset or even
reconstruct this data record using a confidence score vector predicted by the
target model. However, most existing defense methods only protect against
membership inference attacks. Methods that can combat both types of attacks
require a new model to be trained, which may not be time-efficient. In this
paper, we propose a differentially private defense method that handles both
types of attacks in a time-efficient manner by tuning only one parameter, the
privacy budget. The central idea is to modify and normalize the confidence
score vectors with a differential privacy mechanism which preserves privacy and
obscures membership and reconstructed data. Moreover, this method can guarantee
the order of scores in the vector to avoid any loss in classification accuracy.

very-high-energy gamma-ray observatory. The Large-Sized Telescope (LST) of CTA

diameter mirror. We have developed the focal plane camera of the first LST,
which has 1855 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and the readout system which
samples a PMT waveform at GHz with switched capacitor arrays, Domino Ring
Sampler ver4 (DRS4). To measure the precise pulse charge and arrival time of
Cherenkov signals, we developed a method to calibrate the output voltage of
DRS4 and the sampling time interval, as well as an analysis method to correct
the spike noise of DRS4. Since the first LST was inaugurated in 2018, we have
performed the commissioning tests and calibrated the camera. We characterised
the camera in terms of the charge pedestal under various conditions of the
night sky background, the charge resolution of each pixel, the charge
uniformity of the whole camera, and the time resolutions with a test pulse and
calibration laser.

Simulation-based training can alleviate this issue, but may suffer from its
inherent mismatches from the simulator and real environment. It is therefore
imperative to utilize the simulator to learn a robust policy for the real-world
deployment. In this work, we consider policy learning for Robust Markov
Decision Processes (RMDP), where the agent tries to seek a robust policy with
respect to unexpected perturbations on the environments. Specifically, we focus
on the setting where the training environment can be characterized as a
generative model and a constrained perturbation can be added to the model
during testing. Our goal is to identify a near-optimal robust policy for the
perturbed testing environment, which introduces additional technical
difficulties as we need to simultaneously estimate the training environment
uncertainty from samples and find the worst-case perturbation for testing. To
solve this issue, we propose a generic method which formalizes the perturbation
as an opponent to obtain a two-player zero-sum game, and further show that the
Nash Equilibrium corresponds to the robust policy. We prove that, with a
polynomial number of samples from the generative model, our algorithm can find
a near-optimal robust policy with a high probability. Our method is able to
deal with general perturbations under some mild assumptions and can also be
extended to more complex problems like robust partial observable Markov

models with square loss. Such a model is agnostic of absolute similarity values
and it penalizes the regression error at all ranges of similarity values at the

important to predict high-level similarity more accurately than low-level

function to concentrate around the high-similarity band, resulting poor
performance in query similarity prediction task. We address the above challenge
by considering the query prediction as an ordinal regression problem, and
thereby propose a model, ORDSIM (ORDinal Regression for SIMilarity Prediction).
ORDSIM exploits variable-width buckets to model ordinal loss, which penalizes

Unfortunately, in medical literature, cause and effect phrases in a sentence

solve this problem by designing an unsupervised method for cause and effect

simulations to address the effect of stretching on the phononic contribution to
the heat conduction of molecular junctions consisting of single long-chain
alkanes and various metal leads such as Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, and Pt. The thermal
conductance of such junctions is found to be much smaller than the intrinsic
thermal conductance of the polymer and significantly depends on the nature of
metal leads as expressed by the metal-molecule coupling and metal vibrational
density of states. This behavior is expected and reflects the mismatch of
phonon spectra at the metal molecule interfaces. As a function of stretching,
we find a behavior similar to what was observed earlier [J. Chem. Phys. 153,
164903 (2020)] for pure polymeric structures. At relatively short electrode
distances, where the polyethylene chains are compressed, it is found that the
thermal conductances of the molecular junctions remain almost constant as one
stretches the polymer chains. At critical electrode distances, the thermal
conductances start to increase, reaching the values of the fully-extended
molecular junctions. Similar behaviors are observed for junctions in which
several long-chain alkanes are sandwiched between various metal leads.
  These findings indicate that this behavior under stretching is an intrinsic
property of the polymer chain and not significantly associated with the
interfacial structures.

generated image has been a promising technique to resist steganalysis
detection. However, due to the inefficiency and irreversibility of the
secret-to-image transformation, it is hard to find a good trade-off between the
information hiding capacity and extraction accuracy. To address this issue, we
propose a secret-to-image reversible transformation (S2IRT) scheme for
generative steganography. The proposed S2IRT scheme is based on a generative
model, i.e., Glow model, which enables a bijective-mapping between latent space
with multivariate Gaussian distribution and image space with a complex
distribution. In the process of S2I transformation, guided by a given secret
message, we construct a latent vector and then map it to a generated image by
the Glow model, so that the secret message is finally transformed to the
generated image. Owing to good efficiency and reversibility of S2IRT scheme,
the proposed steganographic approach achieves both high hiding capacity and
accurate extraction of secret message from generated image. Furthermore, a
separate encoding-based S2IRT (SE-S2IRT) scheme is also proposed to improve the
robustness to common image attacks. The experiments demonstrate the proposed
steganographic approaches can achieve high hiding capacity (up to 4 bpp) and
accurate information extraction (almost 100% accuracy rate) simultaneously,
while maintaining desirable anti-detectability and imperceptibility.

order or disorder distribution of lattice B-sites. We analyze the case that the
Fe-Cr superexchange is antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling
respectively. The simulation result shows that the theoretical calculation
formula is suitable for the calculation of different B-site distribution.
Through the simulation, we find that when the x and y are large, the system
will appear obvious long-range order. The DM interaction has a certain
influence on the saturation magnetization. Via calculation, we found that the
distribution states of Fe and Cr do not always conform to the uniform

The establishment of this model offers an explanation for several previously

complex systems. But recent research has identified limits of classical
networks, where links connect pairs of nodes, to comprehensively describe group
interactions. Higher-order networks, where a link can connect more than two
nodes, have therefore emerged as a new frontier in network science. Since group
interactions are common in social, biological, and technological systems,
higher-order networks have recently led to important new discoveries across
many fields of research. We here review these works, focusing in particular on
the novel aspects of the dynamics that emerges on higher-order networks. We
cover a variety of dynamical processes that have thus far been studied,
including different synchronization phenomena, contagion processes, the
evolution of cooperation, and consensus formation. We also outline open
challenges and promising directions for future research.

that contains the identity and pose information respectively from a given
source image and a driving video.Existing works for this task heavily rely on
2D representations (e.g. appearance and motion) learned from the input images.
However, dense 3D facial geometry (e.g. pixel-wise depth) is extremely
important for this task as it is particularly beneficial for us to essentially
generate accurate 3D face structures and distinguish noisy information from the
possibly cluttered background. Nevertheless, dense 3D geometry annotations are
prohibitively costly for videos and are typically not available for this video
generation task. In this paper, we first introduce a self-supervised geometry
learning method to automatically recover the dense 3D geometry (i.e.depth) from
the face videos without the requirement of any expensive 3D annotation data.
Based on the learned dense depth maps, we further propose to leverage them to
estimate sparse facial keypoints that capture the critical movement of the
human head. In a more dense way, the depth is also utilized to learn 3D-aware
cross-modal (i.e. appearance and depth) attention to guide the generation of
motion fields for warping source image representations. All these contributions
compose a novel depth-aware generative adversarial network (DaGAN) for talking
head generation. Extensive experiments conducted demonstrate that our proposed

learning (DL) scheme to improve the 1-bit compressed sensing-based superimposed
CSI feedback. On the user side, the downlink CSI is compressed with the 1-bit
CS technique, superimposed on the uplink user data sequences (UL-US), and then
sent back to the base station (BS). At the BS, based on the model-driven
approach and assisted by the superimposition-interference cancellation
technology, a multi-task detection network is first constructed for detecting
both the UL-US and downlink CSI. In particular, this detection network is
jointly trained to detect the UL-US and downlink CSI simultaneously, capturing
a globally optimized network parameter. Then, with the recovered bits for the
downlink CSI, a lightweight reconstruction scheme, which consists of an initial
feature extraction of the downlink CSI with the simplified traditional method
and a single hidden layer network, is utilized to reconstruct the downlink CSI
with low processing delay. Compared with the 1-bit CS-based superimposed CSI

the constrained Hamiltonian formalism. In particular, we demonstrate how the
transversality conditions restricting the diffeomorphism parameters emerge from
the algebra of the Hamiltonian constraints. The alternative form is long known
as parametrizing the volume preserving diffeomorphisms by unrestricted
two-forms instead of the transverse vector fields. This gauge symmetry is
reducible. We work out the Hamiltonian description of this form of unimodular
gravity (UG) gauge symmetry.
Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin--Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV-BRST) Hamiltonian
formalism is constructed for both forms of the UG gauge symmetry. These two
BRST complexes have a subtle inequivalence: Their BRST cohomology groups are
not isomorphic. In particular, for the first complex, which is related to the
restricted gauge parameters, the cosmological constant does not correspond to
any nontrivial BRST cocycle, while for the alternative complex it does. In the
wording of physics, this means $\Lambda$ is a fixed parameter defined by the
field asymptotics rather than the physical observable from the standpoint of
the first complex. The second formalism views $\Lambda$ as the observable with
unrestricted initial data.

in which we show the generalization error of semi-supervised learning can be
effectively bounded by minimizing the training error on labeled data and the
empirical distribution distance between labeled and unlabeled data. Building
upon our new framework and the theoretical bound, we develop a simple and
effective deep semi-supervised learning method called Augmented Distribution

adversarial training strategy from the domain adaptation community and a simple
sample interpolation strategy for data augmentation. Additionally, we
incorporate both strategies in our ADA-Net into two exiting SSL methods to
further improve their generalization capability, which indicates that our new

caused by holographic dark energy with energy density $3M_p^2 c^2 / L^2$. The

provides a proper description for the late time acceleration expansion. This
motivates us to study the role of the same holographic dark energy in the
scenario of constant-roll inflation. One of the main features of constant-roll
inflation is that the second slow-roll parameter is constant which is not
necessarily small. This feature brings a differential equation for the
parameter $c$. After finding an analytical solution for the parameter, the
observable parameters are obtained at the time of inflation, and by comparing
the model with data, the constants of the model are determined. The energy
scale of inflation is estimated which is about $10^{16} \; {\rm GeV}$. Finally,
a correspondence between the HDE and canonical scalar field is considered and
the behavior of the constructed potential and its magnitude is discussed.

multiple homogeneous sensing tasks. Each of the task requesters report bid
along with the number of homogeneous sensing tasks to the platform. On the
other side, we have multiple IoT devices that reports the ask (charge for

The valuations of task requesters and IoT devices are private information, and

the bids and asks of the agents (task providers and IoT devices) follow
decreasing marginal returns criteria. In this paper, a truthful mechanism is
proposed for allocating the IoT devices to the sensing tasks carried by task
requesters, that also keeps into account the quality of IoT devices. The

specific environment is also costly and laborious. In this paper, we thus 1)
formulate the offline dynamics adaptation by using (source) offline data
collected from another dynamics to relax the requirement for the extensive
(target) offline data, 2) characterize the dynamics shift problem in which
prior offline methods do not scale well, and 3) derive a simple dynamics-aware
reward augmentation (DARA) framework from both model-free and model-based
offline settings. Specifically, DARA emphasizes learning from those source
transition pairs that are adaptive for the target environment and mitigates the
offline dynamics shift by characterizing state-action-next-state pairs instead
of the typical state-action distribution sketched by prior offline RL methods.
The experimental evaluation demonstrates that DARA, by augmenting rewards in
the source offline dataset, can acquire an adaptive policy for the target
environment and yet significantly reduce the requirement of target offline
data. With only modest amounts of target offline data, our performance
consistently outperforms the prior offline RL methods in both simulated and
real-world tasks.

where the core challenge lies in capturing the key semantic items, like objects

video clips in a global level~(across multi frames), or key regions within each

and key regions latter. In this paper, we propose a novel joint-hierarchical

frames and the key regions jointly into the captioning model in a hierarchical
manner. Such a joint-hierarchical attention model first conducts a global
selection to identify key frames, followed by a Gumbel sampling operation to
identify further key regions based on the key frames, achieving an accurate
global-to-local feature representation to guide the captioning. Extensive
quantitative evaluations on two public benchmark datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT

traditional statistical analysis and smoothing techniques based on the

then treated as smooth random fields and statistical inferences can be

span from the video that can semantically answer the question. Existing methods
tend to formulate the TAGV task with a visual span-based question answering
(QA) approach by matching the visual frame span queried by the text question.
However, due to the weak correlations and huge gaps of the semantic features
between the textual question and visual answer, existing methods adopting
visual span predictor perform poorly in the TAGV task. To bridge these gaps, we
propose a visual-prompt text span localizing (VPTSL) method, which introduces
the timestamped subtitles as a passage to perform the text span localization
for the input text question, and prompts the visual highlight features into the
pre-trained language model (PLM) for enhancing the joint semantic
representations. Specifically, the context query attention is utilized to
perform cross-modal interaction between the extracted textual and visual

highlighting for the visual prompt. To alleviate semantic differences between
textual and visual features, we design the text span predictor by encoding the
question, the subtitles, and the prompted visual highlight features with the
PLM. As a result, the TAGV task is formulated to predict the span of subtitles
matching the visual answer. Extensive experiments on the medical instructional
dataset, namely MedVidQA, show that the proposed VPTSL outperforms the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 28.36% in terms of mIOU with a large margin,

molecule synthesis in space. It motivates us to construct a theoretical
synthesis model.
  Aims. We develop a new code to simulate global reaction sequences of organic
molecules to apply it for sugar synthesis by intermittent UV irradiation on the
surface of icy particles in a protoplanetary disk. Here we show the first
results of our new simulation.
  Methods. We apply a Monte Carlo method to select reaction sequences from all
possible reactions, using the graph-theoretic matrix model for chemical
reactions and modeling reactions on the icy particles during UV irradiation.
  Results. We here obtain the results consistent with the organic molecules in
carbonaceous chondrites and obtained by the experiments, however, through a
different pathway from the conventional formose reactions previously suggested.
During UV irradiation, loosely-bonded O-rich large molecules are continuously
created and destroyed. After UV irradiation is turned off, the ribose abundance
rapidly increases, through the decomposition of the large molecules with
break-ups of O-O bonds and replacements of C-OH by C-H to reach O/C = 1 for
sugars. The sugar abundance is regulated mostly by the total atomic ratio H/O
of starting materials, but not by their specific molecule forms. Deoxyribose is
simultaneously synthesized, and most of the molecules end up with complex
C-rich molecules.

that the heat transfer deterioration occurred in combination with the property
changes of sCO2 and the depreciation of turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) for

which can take weeks or months even with high performance GPUs. As a remedy for
this challenge, community has started exploring the use of more efficient data
representations in the training process, e.g., block floating point (BFP).
However, prior work on BFP-based DNN accelerators rely on a specific BFP
representation making them less versatile. This paper builds upon an
algorithmic observation that we can accelerate the training by leveraging
multiple BFP precisions without compromising the finally achieved accuracy.
Backed up by this algorithmic opportunity, we develop a flexible DNN training
accelerator, dubbed FlexBlock, which supports three different BFP precision
modes, possibly different among activation, weight, and gradient tensors. While
several prior works proposed such multi-precision support for DNN accelerators,
not only do they focus only on the inference, but also their core utilization
is suboptimal at a fixed precision and specific layer types when the training
is considered. Instead, FlexBlock is designed in such a way that high core
utilization is achievable for i) various layer types, and ii) three BFP
precisions by mapping data in a hierarchical manner to its compute units. We
evaluate the effectiveness of FlexBlock architecture using well-known DNNs on
CIFAR, ImageNet and WMT14 datasets. As a result, training in FlexBlock
significantly improves the training speed by 1.5~5.3x and the energy efficiency
by 2.4~7.0x on average compared to other training accelerators and incurs
marginal accuracy loss compared to full-precision training.

that assigning proper prior weights to error-prone pixels such as object
boundaries can significantly improve the segmentation quality. Specifically, we
present the \textit{pixel null model} (PNM), a prior model that weights each

period--luminosity relations (PLRs) owing to its accurate distance measured
from water maser motions. We expand on previous efforts and carry out a new
Cepheid search in this system using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We
discover and measure a sample of 669 Cepheids in four new and two archival NGC
4258 fields, doubling the number of known Cepheids in this galaxy and obtaining
an absolute calibration of their optical PLRs. We determine a Wesenheit PLR of
$-2.574(\pm0.034) -3.294(\pm0.042) \log P$, consistent with an independent
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) calibration at the level of $0.032\pm0.044$~mag in
its zeropoint, after accounting for a metallicity dependence of
$-0.20\pm0.05$~mag\,dex$^{-1}$ (Riess et al. 2006). Our determination of the
PLR slope also agrees with the LMC-based value within their uncertainties. We
attempt to characterize the metallicity effect of Cepheid PLRs using only the
NGC 4258 sample, but a relatively narrow span of abundances limits our
sensitivity and yields a Wesenheit zero-point dependence of $-0.07 \pm 0.21$
mag\,dex$^{-1}$. The Cepheid measurements presented in this study have been
used as part of the data to derive the Hubble constant in a companion paper by
the SH0ES team.

density \ph{functional, termed vdW-DF-ahbr,} within the non-empirical vdW-DF
method [JPCM 32, 393001 (2020)]. It combines correlation from vdW-DF2 with a
screened Fock exchange that is fixed by \ph{a new model of exchange effects} in
the density-explicit vdW-DF2-b86r functional [PRB 89, 121103(R) (2014)]. The
new vdW-DF2-ahbr prevents spurious exchange binding and has a
small-density-gradient form set from many-body perturbation analysis. It is
accurate for \ph{bulk as well as layered materials} and it systematically and
significantly improves the performance of present vdW-DFs for molecular
problems. Importantly, vdW-DF2-ahbr also outperforms present-standard
(dispersion-corrected) range-separated hybrids on a broad collection of
noncovalent-interaction benchmark sets, while at the same time successfully
mitigating the density-driven errors that often affect the description of
molecular transition states and isomerization calculations. vdW-DF2-ahbr
furthermore improves on state of the art density functional theory approaches
by 1) correctly predicting both the substrate structure and the site preference
for CO adsorption on Pt(111), 2) outperforming existing non-empirical vdW-DFs
for the description of CO$_2$ adsorption in both a functionalized and in a
simple metal-organic framework, and 3) being highly accurate \ph{for the} set
of base-pair interactions in a model of DNA assembly.

wind, particularly close to the magnetic reconnection regions, is still an open
question. For that purpose, we used the fluid model to obtain the mechanism
behind the formation of solitary waves in space plasmas with a variety of
components. Our findings reveal that at the separatrix of the magnetic
reconnection in the Earth's magnetotail, the counter-ejected electron beam
leads to a broadening of the pulse amplitude. While increasing the electron
beam positive velocity causes a bit increase in the soliton amplitude.
Moreover, we observed that the soliton profile is very sensitive to the plasma
parameters like density and temperature. The calculated electric field using
the current model and the measured electric field in the Earth's magnetosphere
and solar wind is highlighted.

fidelity, an overlap between the input and output states. Along with the first
moment, we introduce the second moment of fidelity in CV teleportation, i.e.,
the fidelity deviation as the figures of merit to assess the protocol's
efficiency. We show that CV states, both Gaussian and non Gaussian, can be
better characterized by considering both average fidelity and fidelity
deviation, which is not possible with only average fidelity. Moreover, we shed
light on the performance of the teleportation protocol in two different input
scenarios - one is when input states are sampled from constrained uniform
distribution while the other one is Gaussian suppression of the input states
which again lead to a different classification of CV states according to their
performance. The entire analysis is carried out in noiseless and noisy
scenarios with noise being incorporated in the measurement and the shared
channels. We also report that one type of noise can make the protocol robust
against the other one which leads to a `constructive effect' and identify the
noise models which are responsible for decreasing average fidelity and
increment in fidelity deviation.

105, 144203 (2022)) which studies the growth of the number entropy $S_N$ in the
Heisenberg model with random magnetic fields after a quantum quench. The
authors present arguments for an intermediate power-law growth in time $t$ and
a sub-ergodic saturation value, claiming consistency of their results with
many-body localization (MBL) for strong disorder. We show that these
interpretations are inconsistent with other recent studies and discuss specific
issues with the analysis of the numerical data. We point out, in particular,
that (i) the saturation values $\widetilde{S}_N(L,W)$ for fixed length $L$ are
only bounded from above by 'the ergodic value' and are already far below this
value for $W\ll 1$. Furthermore, the saturation values can show non-monotonic
scaling with $L$. (ii) Power-law fits $S_N(t)\sim 1/t^\alpha$ -- with
$\alpha=1$ expected based on the resonance model described in the paper --
yield a system-size dependent exponent $\alpha$ while fits $S_N\sim
\frac{1}{W^3}\ln\ln t$ do hold independent of system size and over several
orders of magnitude in time. (iii) We also argue that for the cases where the
effective resonance model works best and predicts a saturation of the number
entropy, the same applies to the von-Neumann entropy, i.e.~the dynamics at the

technologies and a boost of computing power, Deep Learning (DL) based
approaches have drawn enormous attention in the past decade due to their
impressive performance in extracting complex relations from raw data and
representing valuable information. Meanwhile, though, rooted in its notorious
black-box nature, the appreciation of DL has been highly debated due to the
lack of interpretability. On the one hand, DL only utilizes statistical
features contained in raw data while ignoring human knowledge of the underlying
system, which results in both data inefficiency and trust issues; on the other
hand, a trained DL model does not provide to researchers any extra insight
about the underlying system beyond its output, which, however, is the essence
of most fields of science, e.g. physics and economics.
  This thesis addresses the issue of interpretability in general information
modeling and endeavors to ease the problem from two scopes. Firstly, a
problem-oriented perspective is applied to incorporate knowledge into modeling
practice, where interesting mathematical properties emerge naturally which cast
constraints on modeling. Secondly, given a trained model, various methods could
be applied to extract further insights about the underlying system. These two
pathways are termed as guided model design and secondary measurements.
Remarkably, a novel scheme emerges for the modeling practice in statistical
learning: Algebraic Learning (AgLr). Instead of being restricted to the
discussion of any specific model, AgLr starts from idiosyncrasies of a learning
task itself and studies the structure of a legitimate model class. This novel
scheme demonstrates the noteworthy value of abstract algebra for general AI,
which has been overlooked in recent progress, and could shed further light on
interpretable information modeling.

Shannon's theoretical concept to current high-efficient practical systems.
Classical communication systems address the capability-deficiency issue mainly
by module-stacking and technique-densification with ever-increasing complexity.
In such a traditional viewpoint, classical source coding only uses explicit
probabilistic models to compress data, regardless of the meaning of transmitted
source messages. Also, channel coded transmission does not identify the source
content. In this sense, state-of-the-art communication systems work merely at
the technical level as summarized by Weaver. Unlike the traditional system
design philosophy, this article proposes a new route to boost the system
capabilities towards intelligence-endogenous and primitive-concise
communications. The communication paradigm upgrades to the semantic level,
which is radically different since all the key techniques imply the use of
meanings of transmitted data, thus deeply changing the design of the
communication system. This paradigm shifting unveils a promising direction due
to its ability to offer an identical quality of service with much lower data
transmission requirement. Different from other similar works, this article
constitutes a brief tutorial on the framework of semantic communications, its
gain analyzed from the information theory perspective, a method to calculate
the semantic compression bound, and an exemplary use case of semantic
communications.

since they only use convolution-based fusion operations. In this paper, we
propose a novel Slice Attention Transformer (SATr) block which can be easily
plugged into convolution-based ULD backbones to form hybrid network structures.
Such newly formed hybrid backbones can better model long-distance feature
dependency via the cascaded self-attention modules in the Transformer block
while still holding a strong power of modeling local features with the
convolutional operations in the original backbone. Experiments with five
state-of-the-art methods show that the proposed SATr block can provide an
almost free boost to lesion detection accuracy without extra hyperparameters or

deviation of scapula and humerus from the medical images that are acquired from
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging. However, taking high-resolution MR images is
time-consuming and costly because the reduction of the physical distance
between image slices causes prolonged scanning time. Moreover, due to the lack
of training images, images from various sources must be utilized, which creates
the issue of high variance across the dataset. Also, there are human errors
among the images due to the fact that it is hard to take the spatial
relationship into consideration when labeling the 3D image in low resolution.
In order to combat all obstacles stated above, we develop a fully automated
algorithm for segmenting the humerus and scapula bone from coarsely scanned and
low-resolution MR images and a recursive learning framework that iterative
utilize the generated labels for reducing the errors among segmentations and
increase our dataset set for training the next round network. In this study, 50
MR images are collected from several institutions and divided into five
mutually exclusive sets for carrying five-fold cross-validation. Contours that
are generated by the proposed method demonstrated a high level of accuracy when
compared with ground truth and the traditional method. The proposed neural
network and the recursive learning scheme improve the overall quality of the
segmentation on humerus and scapula on the low-resolution dataset and reduced
incorrect segmentation in the ground truth, which could have a positive impact
on finding the cause of shoulder pain and patient's early relief.

total energies of the interface system rather than atomic energies. The
performance of modified HDNN trained on 5789 interface structures of

levels of structural deviations from the training dataset. Root mean squared
error (RMSE) for test interfaces fall in the range of 0.01-0.45 eV/atom,
depending on the structural deviations from the reference training dataset. By
avoiding incorrect decomposition of total energy into atomic energies, modified

cost-effective means of designing interfaces in heterostructure energy storage

Additionally, a 2D finite element model (FEM) was developed using COMSOL
Multiphysics software to verify the accuracy of the derived analytical solution

studies were performed to evaluate the influence of the vibration frequency,
vibration amplitude, mean relaxation time, and zero-shear viscosity on mucus
mobilization. Results prove that the analytical and numerical results are
within acceptable error tolerance and thus in excellent agreement. Besides, the
parametric studies indicate a 48%, 57%, and 343% improvement in mucus
mobilization when the mean relaxation time, vibration amplitude, and vibration
frequency, respectively were increased by a factor of 6. Conversely, the mucus
mobilization decreased by 25% when the zero-shear viscosity was increased by a
factor of 6. In general, this study confirms that mucus mobilization in a tube
can be improved by increasing the magnitude of vibration amplitude and
vibration frequency. Similarly, the larger the magnitude of mucus mean
relaxation time the better the mucus mobilization when the tube is subjected to
boundary vibrations. Finally, mucus mobilization decreases as the magnitude of
mucus viscosity increases.
