  Dictionary for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection",,,"10.1109/TGRS.2022.3195339",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, many collaborative representation-based (CR) algorithms have been
proposed for hyperspectral anomaly detection. CR-based detectors approximate
the image by a linear combination of background dictionaries and the
coefficient matrix, and derive the detection map by utilizing recovery
residuals. However, these CR-based detectors are often established on the
premise of precise background features and strong image representation, which
are very difficult to obtain. In addition, pursuing the coefficient matrix
reinforced by the general $l_2$-min is very time consuming. To address these
issues, a nonnegative-constrained joint collaborative representation model is
proposed in this paper for the hyperspectral anomaly detection task. To extract
reliable samples, a union dictionary consisting of background and anomaly
sub-dictionaries is designed, where the background sub-dictionary is obtained
at the superpixel level and the anomaly sub-dictionary is extracted by the
pre-detection process. And the coefficient matrix is jointly optimized by the
Frobenius norm regularization with a nonnegative constraint and a sum-to-one
constraint. After the optimization process, the abnormal information is finally
derived by calculating the residuals that exclude the assumed background
information. To conduct comparable experiments, the proposed
nonnegative-constrained joint collaborative representation (NJCR) model and its
kernel version (KNJCR) are tested in four HSI data sets and achieve superior
results compared with other state-of-the-art detectors.

when it comes to handling forces and torques, these systems often fall short.
We introduce an approach that provides a combination of task-level planning
with targeted learning of scenario-specific parameters for skill-based systems.
We propose the following pipeline: (1) the user provides a task goal in the
planning language PDDL, (2) a plan (i.e., a sequence of skills) is generated
and the learnable parameters of the skills are automatically identified. An
operator then chooses (3) reward functions and hyperparameters for the learning
process. Two aspects of our methodology are critical: (a) learning is tightly
integrated with a knowledge framework to support symbolic planning and to
provide priors for learning, (b) using multi-objective optimization. This can
help to balance key performance indicators (KPIs) such as safety and task
performance since they can often affect each other. We adopt a multi-objective
Bayesian optimization approach and learn entirely in simulation. We demonstrate
the efficacy and versatility of our approach by learning skill parameters for
two different contact-rich tasks. We show their successful execution on a real
7-DOF KUKA-iiwa manipulator and outperform the manual parameterization by human
robot operators.

the immediate strong consequence that if all points in the backward orbit of

rational function not conjugate over $\mathbb Q^{\text{ab}}$ to a power or a
Chebyshev map and all preimages of $\alpha$ are abelian, we show that $\phi$ is
$\mathbb Q$-conjugate to one of two specific quadratic functions, in the spirit

over-parameterized neural networks trained with gradient descent (GD)
generalize well on real datasets even though they are capable of fitting random
datasets of comparable size? Furthermore, from among all solutions that fit the
training data, how does GD find one that generalizes well (when such a
well-generalizing solution exists)? We argue that the answer to both questions
lies in the interaction of the gradients of different examples during training.
Intuitively, if the per-example gradients are well-aligned, that is, if they
are coherent, then one may expect GD to be (algorithmically) stable, and hence
generalize well. We formalize this argument with an easy to compute and
interpretable metric for coherence, and show that the metric takes on very
different values on real and random datasets for several common vision
networks. The theory also explains a number of other phenomena in deep
learning, such as why some examples are reliably learned earlier than others,
why early stopping works, and why it is possible to learn from noisy labels.
Moreover, since the theory provides a causal explanation of how GD finds a
well-generalizing solution when one exists, it motivates a class of simple
modifications to GD that attenuate memorization and improve generalization.
Generalization in deep learning is an extremely broad phenomenon, and
therefore, it requires an equally general explanation. We conclude with a
survey of alternative lines of attack on this problem, and argue that the
proposed approach is the most viable one on this basis.

`potentials') relative to the latent state dynamics. The particular focus of
this work is on particle filters to approximate time-discretisations of
continuous-time Feynman--Kac path integral models -- a scenario that naturally
arises when addressing filtering and smoothing problems in continuous time --
but our findings are indicative about weakly informative settings beyond this
context too. We study the performance of different resampling schemes, such as
systematic resampling, SSP (Srinivasan sampling process) and stratified
resampling, as the time-discretisation becomes finer and also identify their
continuous-time limit, which is expressed as a suitably defined `infinitesimal
generator.' By contrasting these generators, we find that (certain
modifications of) systematic and SSP resampling `dominate' stratified and
independent `killing' resampling in terms of their limiting overall resampling
rate. The reduced intensity of resampling manifests itself in lower variance in
our numerical experiment. This efficiency result, through an ordering of the
resampling rate, is new to the literature. The second major contribution of
this work concerns the analysis of the limiting behaviour of the entire
population of particles of the particle filter as the time discretisation
becomes finer. We provide the first proof, under general conditions, that the
particle approximation of the discretised continuous-time Feynman--Kac path
integral models converges to a (uniformly weighted) continuous-time particle
system.

principle, provides the energy and momentum needed to excite the vacuum and

with a magnetic hard axis along the $c$-axis and a $\Gamma_{6} =
|\pm1/2\rangle$ doublet ground state. The application of external pressure
strongly suppresses the charge density wave order, which is completely
suppressed above 0.8(1)~GPa, and induces a metallic ground state. No evidence
for superconductivity is detected above 2~K. Conversely, the antiferromagnetic
state is favored by pressure, reaching a transition temperature of 5.3~K at
3.8(1)~GPa. Notably, the resistivity anomaly characterizing the
antiferromagnetic order changes with increasing pressure, indicating that two
different magnetic phases might be present in Ce$_{3}$Cd$_{2}$As$_{6}$ under
pressure. This change in ordering appears to be associated to the crossing of
the $T_{\rm CDW}$ and $T_{\rm N}$ lines.

agent behaviors. However, preference-based learning often requires a large
amount of human feedback, making it difficult to apply this approach to various

typically addressed by using unlabeled samples or data augmentation techniques
in the context of supervised learning. Motivated by the recent success of these
approaches, we present SURF, a semi-supervised reward learning framework that
utilizes a large amount of unlabeled samples with data augmentation. In order
to leverage unlabeled samples for reward learning, we infer pseudo-labels of
the unlabeled samples based on the confidence of the preference predictor. To
further improve the label-efficiency of reward learning, we introduce a new
data augmentation that temporally crops consecutive subsequences from the
original behaviors. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly

hyperspectral cubes similarly to MicrOmega. Our results indicate that point

detect their low content in alteration minerals. However, significant spectral
mixing occurs in the point measurements, even at spot sizes down to a few

confirm their non-Lambertian behavior, with backward and suspected forward
scattering peaks. With changing observation geometry, the main absorption
strengths show variations up to 10-15 percents. All the spectra presented are

cancer leads to increased cell growth and tumor progression. The two major
classes of MET alterations are gene amplification and exon 14 deletion, both of
which are therapeutic targets and detectable using existing molecular assays.
However, existing tests are limited by their consumption of valuable tissue,
cost and complexity that prevent widespread use. MET alterations could have an
effect on cell morphology, and quantifying these associations could open new
avenues for research and development of morphology-based screening tools. Using
H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), we investigated the association of
distinct cell-morphological features with MET amplifications and MET exon 14
deletions. We found that cell shape, color, grayscale intensity and
texture-based features from both tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor cells
distinguished MET wild-type from MET amplified or MET exon 14 deletion cases.
The association of individual cell features with MET alterations suggested a
predictive model could distinguish MET wild-type from MET amplification or MET
exon 14 deletion. We therefore developed an L1-penalized logistic regression
model, achieving a mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
(ROC-AUC) of 0.77 +/- 0.05sd in cross-validation and 0.77 on an independent

which included features similar to what was found in the univariate analysis as
well as the percent of tumor cells in the tissue. Our study demonstrates that
MET alterations result in a detectable morphological signal in tumor cells and

provides a comprehensive review of recent observations probing outflowing gas
launched over a range of disk radii for a wide range of evolutionary stages,
enabling an empirical understanding of how winds evolve. In parallel, we review
theoretical advancements in both magnetohydrodynamic and photoevaporative disk
wind models and identify predictions that can be confronted with observations.
By linking theory and observations we critically assess the role of disk winds
in the evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary disks. Finally, we explore the
impact of disk winds on planet formation and evolution and highlight
theoretical work, observations, and critical tests for future progress.

The
large and negative Seebeck coefficient of this semimetal remains almost flat
between 300 K and 100 K. This striking feature can be understood by considering
the ratio of electron and hole mobilities and the evolution of their equal
densities with temperature. The large and anisotropic magneto-Seebeck effect in
bismuth, on the other hand, has not been understood up to the present day.
Here, we report on a systematic study of the thermopower of bismuth from room
temperature down to 20 K upon application of a magnetic field of 13.8 T in the
binary-bisectrix plane. The amplitude of the Seebeck coefficient depends on the
orientation of the magnetic field and the anisotropy changes sign with
decreasing temperature. The magneto-Seebeck effect becomes non-monotonic at low
temperatures. When the magnetic field is oriented along the binary axis, the
Seebeck coefficient is not the same for positive and negative fields. This
so-called Umkehr effect arises because the high symmetry axes of the Fermi
surface ellipsoids are neither parallel to each other nor to the high symmetry
axes of the lattice. The complex evolution of thermopower can be accounted for
in a large part of the ($T,B,\Theta$)-space by a model based on semiclassical
transport theory and incorporating Landau quantization. The employed energy
dependence of the scattering time is compatible with electron-acoustic phonon
scattering. We find that the transverse Nernst response plays an important role
in setting the amplitude of the longitudinal magneto-Seebeck effect.
Furthermore, Landau quantization significantly affects thermoelectricity up to
temperatures as high as 120 K.

vertices can be removed from a graph, such that the resulting graph has
treewidth at most two. A graph has treewidth at most two if and only if it does
not contain a $K_4$ minor. Hence, this problem corresponds to the NP-hard
$\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem with $\mathcal{F} = \{K_4\}$. For any variant
of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem where $\mathcal{F}$ contains a planar
graph, it is known that a polynomial kernel exists. I.e., a preprocessing
routine that in polynomial time outputs an equivalent instance of size
$t^{O(1)}$. However, this proof is non-constructive, meaning that this proof
does not yield an explicit bound on the kernel size. The $\{K_4\}$-Minor Cover
problem is the simplest variant of the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem with
an unknown kernel size.
  To develop a constructive kernelization algorithm, we present a new method to
decompose graphs into near-protrusions, such that near-protrusions in this new
decomposition can be reduced using elementary reduction rules. Our method
extends the `approximation and tidying' framework by van Bevern et al.
[Algorithmica 2012] to provide guarantees stronger than those provided by both
this framework and a regular protrusion decomposition. Furthermore, we provide
extensions of the elementary reduction rules used by the $\{K_4,
K_{2,3}\}$-Minor Cover kernelization algorithm introduced by Donkers et al.
[IPEC 2021].
  Using the new decomposition method and reduction rules, we obtain a kernel
consisting of $O(t^{41})$ vertices, which is the first constructive kernel.
This kernel is a step towards more concrete kernelization bounds for the
$\mathcal{F}$-Minor Cover problem where $\mathcal{F}$ contains a planar graph,
and our decomposition provides a potential direction to achieve these new
bounds.

chemical literature as a formal device for constructing generalised coronenes
from smaller structures. The altan of graph $G$, denoted $\mathfrak{a}(G, H)$,
depends on the choice of attachment set $H$ (a cyclic $h$-tuple of vertices of
$G$). From a given pair $(G, H)$, the altan construction produces a pair $(G',
H')$, where $H'$ is called the induced attachment set. Repetition of the
construction, using at each stage the attachment set induced in the previous
step, defines the iterated altan. Here, we prove sharp bounds for the nullity
of altan and iterated altan graphs based on a general parent graph: for any
attachment set with odd $h$, nullities of altan and parent are equal; for any
$h$ and all $k \geq 1$, the $k$-th altan has the same nullity as the first; for
any attachment set with even $h$, the nullity of the altan exceeds the nullity
of the parent graph by one of the three values $\{0, 1, 2\}$. The case of
excess nullity $2$ has not been noticed before; for benzenoids with the natural
attachment set consisting of the CH sites, it occurs first for a parent
structure with $5$ hexagons. On the basis of extensive computation, it is
conjectured that in fact no altan of a convex benzenoid has excess nullity $2$.

to isolate a target audio signal (say Alice's speech) from a mixture of

has gained renewed interest mainly due to the significant growth in voice
controlled devices, including robots in homes, offices, and other public

separation, we find that robotic motion of the microphone -- say the robot's
head -- is a complementary opportunity to past approaches. Briefly, we show
that rotating the microphone array to the correct orientation can produce
desired aliasing between two interferers, causing the two interferers to pose
as one. In other words, a mixture of K signals becomes a mixture of (K-1), a
mathematically concrete gain. We show that the gain translates well to practice
provided two mobility-related challenges can be mitigated. This paper is
focused on mitigating these challenges and demonstrating the end-to-end

relative navigation, by integrating combinations of wheel odometry, visual
odometry, and inertial measurements during each drive to track position
relative to the start of each drive. At the end of each drive, a
ground-in-the-loop (GITL) interaction is used to get a position update from
human operators in a more global reference frame, by matching images or local
maps from onboard the rover to orbital reconnaissance images or maps of a large
region around the rover's current position. Autonomous rover drives are limited
in distance so that accumulated relative navigation error does not risk the
possibility of the rover driving into hazards known from orbital images.
However, several rover mission concepts have recently been studied that require
much longer drives between GITL cycles, particularly for the Moon. These
concepts require greater autonomy to minimize GITL cycles to enable such large
range; onboard global localization is a key element of such autonomy. Multiple
techniques have been studied in the past for onboard rover global localization,
but a satisfactory solution has not yet emerged. For the Moon, the ubiquitous
craters offer a new possibility, which involves mapping craters from orbit,
then recognizing crater landmarks with cameras and-or a lidar onboard the
rover. This approach is applicable everywhere on the Moon, does not require
high resolution stereo imaging from orbit as some other approaches do, and has
potential to enable position knowledge with order of 5 to 10 m accuracy at all
times. This paper describes our technical approach to crater-based lunar rover
localization and presents initial results on crater detection using 3D point

interior to 1~AU. This chapter explores the architectures of these planetary
systems, which often display a remarkable degree of uniformity: the planets
have nearly equal sizes, regular orbital spacing, low eccentricities, and small
mutual inclinations. This uniformity stands in sharp contrast to the diverse
nature of the exoplanet sample considered as a whole (as well as our inner
solar system). We begin with a critical review of the observations -- including
possible biases -- and find that these peas-in-a-pod planetary systems are
apparently a common outcome of the planet formation process. Modest departures
from exact uniformity suggest additional patterns, such as the planet mass
slowly increasing with semi-major axis. The star formation process naturally
produces circumstellar disks with the properties required to produce these
planetary systems, although the solid material must move inward from its
initial location. We discuss primary modes of planetary assembly, the role of
orbital migration, and post-nebular atmospheric loss. Mature planetary systems
are found to be near their minimum energy (tidal equilibrium) configurations;
this finding provides a partial explanation for their observed properties and
indicates that efficient energy dissipation must occur. Finally, we consider
population synthesis models and show that peas-in-a-pod patterns emerge with
reasonable choices for the input parameters. Nonetheless, interesting
observational and theoretical challenges remain in order to understand how
these surprisingly organized planetary systems arise from the disorder of their
formation processes.

an effectiveness score needs to be created for advertising campaigns using a

functions in the absence of labelled data, where the scores need to reflect
business insights and rules as understood by the domain experts. Without a way
to capture these inputs systematically, this becomes a time-consuming process

approach incorporates insights and business rules from domain experts in the
form of easily observable and specifiable constraints, which are used as weak
supervision by a machine learning model. We convert such constraints into loss

accurately model the CH$_4$ radiance at 3.3 $\mu$m measured by ISO/SWS by using
a comprehensive non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model and the most recent
collisional rates measured in the laboratory for CH$_4$ to shed new light onto
the methane concentration in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. These emission

latest laboratory measurements of the CH$_4$ collisional relaxation rates. Our
results provide precise constraints on the composition and dynamics of the

and the electric-field-induced topological phase transition in AB-stacked
MoTe${}_2$/WSe${}_2$ moir\'e heterobilayers at $\nu=1$ hole filling. We suggest
that the Chern band of the QAH state is generated from an intrinsic band
inversion composed of the highest two moir\'e hole bands with opposite valley
numbers and a gap opening induced by two Coulomb-interaction-driven magnetic
orders. These magnetic orders, including an in-plane $120^{\circ}$-N\'eel order
and an in-plane ferromagnetic order, interact with moir\'e bands via
corresponding in-plane exchange fields. The N\'eel order ensures the insulating
gap, the ferromagnetic order induces the non-zero Chern number, and both orders
contribute to time-reversal symmetry breaking. The N\'eel order is acquired
from the Hartree-Fock exchange interaction, and the formation of ferromagnetic
order is attributed to interlayer-exciton condensation and exciton
ferromagnetism. The exciton ferromagnetism can be demonstrated by excitonic
Bose-Hubbard physics and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In low
electric fields, the equilibrium state is a Mott-insulator state. At a certain
electric field, a correlated insulating state composed of the hole-occupied
band and the exciton condensate becomes a new thermodynamically stable phase,
and the topological phase transition occurs as the ferromagnetic order emerges.
The consistency between the present theory and experimental observations is
discussed. Experimental observations, including the
spin-polarized/valley-coherent nature of the QAH state, the absence of charge
gap closure at the topological phase transition, the canted spin texture, and
the insulator-to-metal transition, are interpreted by the mechanism.

residing in faster spinning haloes, as well as those hosting less massive BHs,
tend to have a higher specific angular momentum. We also find that, at fixed
galaxy or halo mass, halo spin and BH mass are anticorrelated with each other,
probably as a consequence of more efficient gas flow toward the galactic centre

role in determining galaxy sizes - larger discs form at the centres of
faster-rotating haloes - although the trend breaks down for massive galaxies

that often are independent of the CKM arameters or depend only on the angles

known and $\gamma$ to be measured precisely in the coming years by the LHCb and
Belle II collaborations. Once $\gamma$ Once $\gamma$ is measured precisely
these 16 ratios taken together are expected to be a powerful tool in the search

determine independently of $|V_{cb}|$:
$\mathcal{B}(K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu)_\text{SM}= (8.60\pm0.42)\times 10^{-11}$
and $\mathcal{B}(K_L\to\pi^0\nu\bar\nu)_\text{SM}=(2.94\pm 0.15)\times

demonstrate, utilising both analytic and numerical studies, that such a
scenario implies an extremely rich dark matter substructure arising purely from
the interplay of gravitational interactions and quantum effects. Due to a
remarkable parametric coincidence between the size of the primordial density
perturbations and the scale at which quantum pressure is relevant, a
substantial fraction of the dark matter inevitably collapses into
gravitationally bound solitons, which are fully quantum coherent objects. The
central densities of these `dark photon star', or `Proca star', solitons are
typically a factor $10^6$ larger than the local background dark matter density,
and they have characteristic masses of $10^{-16} M_\odot (10^{-5}{\rm
eV}/m)^{3/2}$, where $m$ is the mass of the vector. During and post soliton
production a comparable fraction of the energy density is initially stored in,
and subsequently radiated from, long-lived quasi-normal modes. Furthermore, the
solitons are surrounded by characteristic `fuzzy' dark matter halos in which
quantum wave-like properties are also enhanced relative to the usual virialized
dark matter expectations. Lower density compact halos, with masses a factor of
$\sim 10^5$ greater than the solitons, form at much larger scales. We argue
that, at minimum, the solitons are likely to survive to the present day without
being tidally disrupted. This rich substructure, which we anticipate also
arises from other dark photon dark matter production mechanisms, opens up a
wide range of new direct and indirect detection possibilities, as we discuss in
a companion paper.

the leading term, which we test on some treatable two-dimensional examples. We
also derive a general upper bound on the entanglement, valid along the full

higher dimensions it is evaluated at early and late time via the OPE. These CFT
predictions are then compared with a doubly-holographic setup where the CFT is
interpreted as a reservoir for the radiation produced on an end-of-the-world
brane. After finding the gravitational dual of a boundary local quench, we
compute the time evolution of the holographic entanglement entropy, whose
late-time behavior is in perfect agreement with the CFT predictions. In the
brane+bath picture, unitarity of the time evolution is preserved thanks to the
formation of an island. The holographic results can be recovered explicitly

galaxy formation theories and can be determined empirically via the baryonic
Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), which compares a galaxy's baryonic mass (Mbary)
to its maximum rotation velocity (Vmax). The BTFR is well-determined at Mbary
>10^8 Msun, but poorly constrained at lower masses due to small samples and the
challenges of measuring rotation velocities in this regime. For 25 galaxies
with high-quality data and Mbary <~10^8 Msun, we estimate Mbary from infrared
and HI observations and Vmax from the HI gas rotation. Many of the Vmax values
are lower limits because the velocities are still rising at the edge of the
detected HI disks (Rmax); consequently, most of our sample has lower velocities
than expected from extrapolations of the BTFR at higher masses. To estimate
Vmax, we map each galaxy to a dark matter halo assuming density profiles with
and without cores. In contrast to non-cored profiles, we find the cored profile
rotation curves are still rising at Rmax values, similar to the data. When we
compare the Vmax values derived from the cored density profiles to our Mbary
measurements, we find a turndown of the BTFR at low masses that is consistent
with LCDM predictions and implying baryon fractions of 1-10% of the cosmic
value. Although we are limited by the sample size and assumptions inherent in
mapping measured rotational velocities to theoretical rotation curves, our
results suggest that galaxy formation efficiency drops at masses below
Mbary~10^8 Msun, corresponding to Mhalo~10^10 Msun.

entanglement when done only on a small number of qubits at a time. Whereas
previous protocols have entanglement cost independent of the unitary or scaling

sufficient and some additional features should be considered in the design of
the algorithm. In this work, we study the recommendation problem in the setting
where affinities between users and items are based both on their embeddings in
a latent space and on their geographical distance in their underlying euclidean
space (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^2$), together with item capacity constraints. This
framework is motivated by some real-world applications, for instance in
healthcare: the task is to recommend hospitals to patients based on their
location, pathology, and hospital capacities. In these applications, there is
somewhat of an asymmetry between users and items: items are viewed as static
points, their embeddings, capacities and locations constraining the allocation.
Upon the observation of an optimal allocation, user embeddings, items
capacities, and their positions in their underlying euclidean space, our aim is
to recover item embeddings in the latent space; doing so, we are then able to
use this estimate e.g. in order to predict future allocations. We propose an

lepton flavour universality violation. In particular, the $SU(2)_L$ doublet of
scalar leptoquarks $S_2$ is capable of providing an explanation for the
tensions between the measurements and the Standard Model predictions in
$(g-2)_\mu$, $b\to s\ell^+ \ell^-$ and $b\to c\tau\nu$ processes, as well as in
non-resonant di-electron production. However, in the minimal setup with a
single leptoquark generation, a common explanation for all these issues is not
possible as this would lead to unacceptably large charged lepton flavour
violation. We therefore propose a model with three generations of $S_2$, each
coupling exclusively to a single lepton flavour, \textit{i.e.}~a model
extending the Standard Model particle content by an electroquark, a muoquark
and a tauquark. We show that after taking into account other constraints, such
as those originating from electroweak precision observables and $\Delta F=2$
processes, it is possible to provide a combined explanation for all these hints
of lepton flavour universality violation. Moreover, we find that the presence
of the tauquark can generate a dimension-six ${\cal O}_9^U$ operator via
off-shell photon penguin diagrams, which, together with the muoquark
contribution, further improves the global fit to $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ data.

on the degree of articulation and run a series of experiments to study how
articulation strength impacts human perception of lip motion accompanying

We examine the impact of articulation strength on human perception when
considering only lip motion, where viewers are presented with talking faces
represented by landmarks, and in the context of embodied characters, where
viewers are presented with photo-realistic videos. Our results show that
viewers prefer over-articulated lip motion consistently more than

researchers to study the genomes of entire microbial communities. Revealing the
underlying interactions between these communities is of vital importance to
learn how microbes influence human health. Learning these interactions from
microbiome data is challenging, due to the high dimensionality, discreteness,
broad dispersion levels, compositionality and excess of zero counts that
characterize these data. To tackle these issues, we develop a novel Gaussian
copula graphical model with two key elements. Firstly, we model the marginal
distributions via discrete Weibull regression, both to account for the typical
features of microbiome data and to include the dependency from external
covariates, often available in genomic studies but rarely used for network
inference. Secondly, we advance a Bayesian structure learning framework, based
on a computationally efficient search algorithm that is suited to high
dimensionality. The approach returns simultaneous inference of the marginal
effects and of the dependency structure, including graph uncertainty estimates.
A simulation study and a real data analysis of microbiome data highlight the
applicability of the proposed approach at inferring networks from
high-dimensional count data in general, and its relevance to microbiota data
analyses in particular. The proposed method is implemented in the R package
BDgraph.

hard-sphere model (IHSM), where the grains are assumed to be perfectly smooth
spheres colliding with a constant coefficient of normal restitution. A much
more tractable model is the inelastic Maxwell model (IMM), in which the
velocity-dependent collision rate is replaced by an effective mean-field
constant. This simplification has been taken advantage of by many researchers
to find a number of exact results within the IMM. On the other hand, both the
IHSM and IMM neglect the impact of roughness -- generally present in real
grains -- on the dynamic properties of a granular gas. This is remedied by the
inelastic rough hard-sphere model (IRHSM), where, apart from the coefficient of
normal restitution, a constant coefficient of tangential restitution is
introduced. In parallel to the simplification carried out when going from the
IHSM to the IMM, we propose in this paper an inelastic rough Maxwell model
(IRMM) as a simplification of the IRHSM. The tractability of the proposed model
is illustrated by the exact evaluation of the collisional moments of first and
second degree, and the most relevant ones of third and fourth degree. The
results are applied to the evaluation of the rotational-to-translational
temperature ratio and the velocity cumulants in the homogeneous cooling state.

extracted using the primary invariants and any CP-violating observable can be
expressed as the linear combination of CP-odd flavor invariants. The
calculation of the Hilbert series shows that there is an equal number of
primary flavor invariants in the SEFT and in the full seesaw model, which
reveals the intimate connection between the flavor space of the SEFT and that
of its ultraviolet theory. A proper matching procedure of the flavor invariants
is accomplished between the SEFT and the full seesaw model, through which one
can establish a direct link between the CP asymmetries in leptogenesis and

increases the complexity of the robotic systems and their operation upon

locomotion, controlled delivery of liquid medicine, and cargo transportation
with wireless operation. This millirobot takes full advantage of the
geometrical features and folding/unfolding capability of Kresling origami, a
triangulated hollow cylinder, to fulfill multifunction: its geometrical
features are exploited for generating omnidirectional locomotion in various
working environments, including on unstructured ground, in liquids, and at
air-liquid interfaces through rolling, flipping, and spinning-induced
propulsion; the folding/unfolding is utilized as a pumping mechanism for
integrated multifunctionality such as controlled delivery of liquid medicine;
furthermore, the spinning motion provides a sucking mechanism for targeted
solid cargo transportation. This origami millirobot breaks the conventional way
of utilizing origami folding only for shape reconfiguration and integrates
multiple functions in one simple body. We anticipate the reported magnetic
amphibious origami millirobots have the potential to serve as minimally
invasive devices for biomedical diagnoses and treatments.

properties of our spacetime in low-energy effective models related to and

accelerated expansion, which can be described in Einstein's theory of general
relativity as a positive cosmological constant. Within string theory
descriptions, this is realized by a scalar field with a positive value of its
potential. Oftentimes, this is modeled by having the scalar at a stable,
positive minimum. One then obtains a de Sitter spacetime. Constructions of de
Sitter spaces from string theory are not straightforward and face many
criticisms. In this thesis, we address several aspects related to this topic.
We investigate the description of general branes in supergravity and in
particular describe the uplifting anti-D3-brane of the KKLT model, including
all world-volume fields. Additionally, we translate the type IIB based KKLT
model into type IIA and introduce a mechanism that allows for the rapid
construction of many de Sitter solutions. Related to this, we investigate
models based on twisted 7-tori from M-theory and their relation to type II
supergravity. These setups can also yield de Sitter solutions using the same
mass production mechanism. One of the more recent and serious claims against
the construction of de Sitter spaces in string theory, the de Sitter swampland
conjecture, is also addressed here. We highlight the difficulty of obtaining a
stable, positive vacuum energy in classical type IIA flux compactifications and
their reliance on O-plane sources. Then, we turn our attention to the
conjecture itself. Contrary to the initial claim, we find many unstable de
Sitter points in numerical searches and go on to present our own refined
conjecture that differs in several key aspects from the refined version of the
original conjecture.

affected by the XUV (X rays + extreme UV) emission of these stars, with flares
occasionally increasing the XUV flux by more than 2 orders of magnitude above
quiescent levels. This wavelength range can warm and ionize terrestrial
planets' upper atmospheres, which expands the planetary radius and promotes
atmospheric loss. In this work, we study the contribution of the XUV flux due
to flares on the atmospheric escape of Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs
through numerical simulations. We considered the first Gyr of planets with
initial surface water abundances between 1 and 10 terrestrial oceans (TO), a
small primordial hydrogen envelope ($\le$ $10^{-3}$~$M_{\oplus}$), and with
host star masses between 0.2 and 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. In this parameter range, we
find that flares can remove up to two TO more than nonflaring stars, which, in
some cases, translates to a doubling of the total water loss. We also find that
flaring can increase atmospheric oxygen partial pressures by hundreds of bars
in some cases. These results were obtained by adding a new module for flares to
the \vplanet software package and upgrading its atmospheric escape module to
account for Roche lobe overflow and radiation/recombination-limited escape.

extensive effort to understand microscopic behaviors resulting from these

consensus about the microscopic forces that govern smectite properties, which
are model systems for understanding colloidal and interfacial phenomena more
generally. We find that the complex free energy surface arising from the
interplay of at least four intermolecular forces and their nonlinear couplings
that control local particle-particle interactions leads to dynamic, unstable
equilibria between distinct phases. Mechanical disequilibrium arising from
osmotic gradients between curved or interacting interfaces drive the dynamic
exchange of layers and ions between dense and dilute phases via avalanche
transitions that are sustained by thermal fluctuations. We suggest that the
surprising interfacial dynamics displayed by smectite minerals, arising from
the vastly different mobilities of water, ions and mineral, makes them
fundamentally distinct from non-clay minerals because their structures are
easily perturbed away from simultaneous chemical and mechanical equilibrium.

incorrect text. Compounding this is the lack of a standard automatic evaluation
for factuality--it cannot be meaningfully improved if it cannot be measured.
Grounded generation promises a path to solving both of these problems: models
draw on a reliable external document (grounding) for factual information,
simplifying the challenge of factuality. Measuring factuality is also
simplified--to factual consistency, testing whether the generation agrees with
the grounding, rather than all facts. Yet, without a standard automatic metric
for factual consistency, factually grounded generation remains an open problem.
  We study this problem for content transfer, in which generations extend a
prompt, using information from factual grounding. Particularly, this domain
allows us to introduce the notion of factual ablation for automatically
measuring factual consistency: this captures the intuition that the model
should be less likely to produce an output given a less relevant grounding
document. In practice, we measure this by presenting a model with two grounding
documents, and the model should prefer to use the more factually relevant one.
We contribute two evaluation sets to measure this. Applying our new evaluation,
we propose multiple novel methods improving over strong baselines.

entities such as words, apps, and movies. An embedding layer maps each entity
to a unique vector, causing the layer's memory requirement to be proportional
to the number of entities. In the recommendation domain, a given category can
have hundreds of thousands of entities, and its embedding layer can take
gigabytes of memory. The scale of these networks makes them difficult to deploy
in resource constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for reducing the size of an embedding table while still mapping each
entity to its own unique embedding. Rather than maintaining the full embedding
table, we construct each entity's embedding ""on the fly"" using two separate
embedding tables. The first table employs hashing to force multiple entities to
share an embedding. The second table contains one trainable weight per entity,
allowing the model to distinguish between entities sharing the same embedding.
Since these two tables are trained jointly, the network is able to learn a
unique embedding per entity, helping it maintain a discriminative capability
similar to a model with an uncompressed embedding table. We call this approach
MEmCom (Multi-Embedding Compression). We compare with state-of-the-art model

an X-ray source associated with an Abell 85 dwarf galaxy that fits the IMBH
description. The stellar mass of the host galaxy is estimated to be 2 $\times$
10$^8$ $M_\odot$, which makes it one of the least massive galaxies to
potentially host an accreting black hole. The source is detected in the soft
band, under 1 keV, while undetected at higher energies. The X-ray luminosity is
$\approx$ 10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, making it almost three orders of magnitude
more luminous than the most luminous stellar-mass supersoft emitters. From the
galaxy stellar mass vs. black hole mass relation, we estimate the mass to be
within the intermediate regime. Another method that resulted in an intermediate
mass relies on the fact that supersoft emission is expected to be associated
with high accretion rates, approaching the Eddington limit. We suggest that the
observed offset of the X-ray source from the galactic center ($\approx$ 1.8
kpc) is due to galaxy interactions, and we present evidence from the literature

longitudinal YouTube dataset of popular creators, we develop a taxonomy of
alternative monetization strategies and a simple methodology to detect their
usage automatically. We then proceed to characterize the adoption of these
strategies. First, we find that the use of external monetization is expansive
and increasingly prevalent, used in 18% of all videos, with 61% of channels

discovery area. This category of methods is composed of two main steps: 1)
discovering a dependency graph 2) determining the split/join patterns of the
dependency graph. The current dependency graph discovery techniques of
heuristic-based methods select the initial set of graph arcs according to
dependency measures and then modify the set regarding some criteria. This can
lead to selecting the non-optimal set of arcs. Also, the modifications can
result in modeling rare behaviors and, consequently, low precision and
non-simple process models. Thus, constructing dependency graphs through
selecting the optimal set of arcs has a high potential for improving graphs
quality. Hence, this paper proposes a new integer linear programming model that
determines the optimal set of graph arcs regarding dependency measures.
Simultaneously, the proposed method can eliminate some other issues that the
existing methods cannot handle completely; i.e., even in the presence of loops,
it guarantees that all tasks are on a path from the initial to the final tasks.
This approach also allows utilizing domain knowledge by introducing appropriate
constraints, which can be a practical advantage in real-world problems. To
assess the results, we modified two existing methods of evaluating process
models to make them capable of measuring the quality of dependency graphs.
According to assessments, the outputs of the proposed method are superior to
the outputs of the most prominent dependency graph discovery methods in terms
of fitness, precision, and especially simplicity.

level of liquid argon purity through the use of a filtration system that
removes electronegative contaminants in continuously-circulated liquid,
recondensed boil off, and externally supplied argon gas. We use the MicroBooNE
LArTPC to reconstruct MeV-scale radiological decays. Using this technique we
measure the liquid argon filtration system's efficacy at removing radon. This
is studied by placing a 500 kBq $^{222}$Rn source upstream of the filters and
searching for a time-dependent increase in the number of radiological decays in
the LArTPC. In the context of two models for radon mitigation via a liquid
argon filtration system, a slowing mechanism and a trapping mechanism,
MicroBooNE data supports a radon reduction factor of greater than 99.999% or
97%, respectively. Furthermore, a radiological survey of the filters found that
the copper-based filter material was the primary medium that removed the
$^{222}$Rn. This is the first observation of radon mitigation in liquid argon
with a large-scale copper-based filter and could offer a radon mitigation
solution for future large LArTPCs.

of spectral line width to evaluate the response of a discretely- and
continuously-sampled low-resolution AWG (R $\sim$ 1000). We observed that the
LSF has minimal wavelength dependence ($\sim$5\%), irrespective of the offset
with respect to the center-wavelengths of the AWG channels, contrary to the
previous assumptions. We further confirmed that the observed FWHM scales
linearly with the emission line width. Finally, we present simulated extraction
of a sample molecular absorption spectrum with the discretely- and
continuously-sampled low-resolution AWGs. From this, we show that while the
discrete AWG matches its expected resolving power, the continuous AWG

Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), and while achieving impressive results, the

consisting of a codebook and a transformer model. The codebook is used to embed
individual images into a smaller latent space, and the transformer solves the
view synthesis task in this more compact space. To train our model efficiently,
we introduce a novel branching attention mechanism that allows us to use the

compromised internet-connected devices to target and overwhelm other devices
with internet packets. With increasing consumer adoption of high-wattage
internet-facing ""smart devices"", a new ""power botnet"" attack emerges, where
such devices are used to target and overwhelm power grid devices with unusual
load demand. We introduce a variant of this attack, the power-botnet
weardown-attack, which does not intend to cause blackouts or short-term acute
instability, but instead forces expensive mechanical components to activate
more frequently, necessitating costly replacements / repairs. Specifically, we
target the on-load tap-changer (OLTC) transformer, which uses a mechanical
switch that responds to change in load demand. In our analysis and simulations,
these attacks can halve the lifespan of an OLTC, or in the most extreme cases,
reduce it to $2.5\%$ of its original lifespan. Notably, these power botnets are
composed of devices not connected to the internal SCADA systems used to control
power grids. This represents a new internet-based cyberattack that targets the
power grid from the outside. To help the power system to mitigate these types
of botnet attacks, we develop attack-localization strategies. We formulate the
problem as a supervised machine learning task to locate the source of power
botnet attacks. Within a simulated environment, we generate the training and
testing dataset to evaluate several machine learning algorithm based
localization methods, including SVM, neural network and decision tree. We show
that decision-tree based classification successfully identifies power botnet
attacks and locates compromised devices with at least $94\%$ improvement of

cues, such as color, texture, and location, to group pixels into object-like
regions. However, by relying on appearance alone, these methods fail to
separate objects from the background in cluttered scenes. This is a fundamental
limitation since the definition of an object is inherently ambiguous and
context-dependent. To resolve this ambiguity, we choose to focus on dynamic
objects -- entities that can move independently in the world. We then scale the
recent auto-encoder based frameworks for unsupervised object discovery from toy
synthetic images to complex real-world scenes. To this end, we simplify their
architecture, and augment the resulting model with a weak learning signal from
general motion segmentation algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that,
despite only capturing a small subset of the objects that move, this signal is
enough to generalize to segment both moving and static instances of dynamic
objects. We show that our model scales to a newly collected, photo-realistic
synthetic dataset with street driving scenarios. Additionally, we leverage
ground truth segmentation and flow annotations in this dataset for thorough
ablation and evaluation. Finally, our experiments on the real-world KITTI

rectangular cell. By varying the intruder's velocity and the basal friction, we
obtained the resultant force on the intruder and the instantaneous network of
contact forces, which we analyze at both the cell and grain scales. We found
that there is a bearing network that percolates forces from the intruder toward
the walls, being responsible for jammed regions and high values of the drag
force, and a dissipative network that percolates small forces within the
grains, in agreement with previous experiments on compressed granular systems.
In addition, we found the anisotropy levels of the contact network for
different force magnitudes and regions, that the force network can reach
regions far downstream of the intruder by the end of the intruder's motion,
that the extent of the force network decreases with decreasing the basal
friction, and that the void region (cavity) that appears downstream the

Interestingly, our results show that grains within the bearing chains creep
while the chains break, revealing the mechanism by which bearing chains
collapse.

for simulating molecular core-level X-ray photoemission spectra. Traditionally,
$GW$ core-level binding energies have been computed using either the cc-pV$n$Z
or def2-$n$ZVP basis set families, extrapolating the obtained results to the
complete basis set limit, followed by a an element-specific relativistic
correction. Despite of achieving good accuracy, these binding energies are
chronically underestimated. By using first-row elements and standard techniques
known to offer good cost-accuracy ratio in other theories, we show that the
cc-pV$n$Z and def2-$n$ZVP families show large contraction errors and lead to
unreliable complete basis set extrapolations. On the other hand, we demonstrate
that uncontracted versions of these basis sets offer vastly improved
convergence. Even faster convergence can be obtained using core-rich,
property-optimized, basis sets families like pcSseg-$n$, pcJ-$n$ and ccX-$n$Z.
Finally, we also show that the improvement over the core properties does not
degrade the calculation of the valence excitations, and thus offer a balanced
description of both core and valence regions.

ratios are often used, but can increase variance in the algorithms and reduce
the rate of learning. Several variations of importance sampling have been
proposed to reduce variance, with per-decision importance sampling being the
most popular. However, the update rules for most off-policy algorithms in the

correct the entire TD error instead of just the TD target. In this work, we
show how this slight change can be interpreted as a control variate for the TD
target, reducing variance and improving performance. Experiments over a wide

United States, and, historically, electric power systems have ignited some of
the most destructive wildfires. To reduce wildfire ignition risks, power system
operators preemptively de-energize high-risk power lines during extreme
wildfire conditions as part of ""Public Safety Power Shutoff"" (PSPS) events.
While capable of substantially reducing acute wildfire risks, PSPS events can
also result in significant amounts of load shedding as the partially
de-energized system may not be able to supply all customer demands. In this
work, we investigate the extent to which infrastructure investments can support
system operations during PSPS events by enabling reduced load shedding and
wildfire ignition risk. We consider the installation of grid-scale batteries,
solar PV, and line hardening or maintenance measures (e.g., undergrounding or
increased vegetation management). Optimally selecting the locations, types, and
sizes of these infrastructure investments requires considering the line
de-energizations associated with PSPS events. Accordingly, this paper proposes
a multi-period optimization formulation that locates and sizes infrastructure
investments while simultaneously choosing line de-energizations to minimize
wildfire ignition risk and load shedding. This formulation is evaluated using
two geolocated test cases along with realistic infrastructure investment
parameters and actual wildfire risk data from the US Geological Survey. We
evaluate the performance of investment choices by simulating de-energization
decisions for the entire 2021 wildfire season with optimized infrastructure
placements. With investment decisions varying significantly for different test
cases, budgets, and operator priorities, the numerical results demonstrate the
proposed formulation's value in tailoring investment choices to different

present a reduction that has neither of these deficiencies: We introduce two
security games related to finding decryption failures, one capturing the
computationally hard task of using the public key to find a decryption failure,
and one capturing the statistically hard task of searching the random oracle
for key-independent failures like, e.g., large randomness. As a result, our
security bounds in the QROM are tighter than previous ones with respect to the
generic random oracle search attacks: The attacker can only partially compute

our entire reduction works for the explicit-reject variant of the

model to achieve one or both of the following goals: (1) increasing the network
bandwidth, (2) degrading the video quality for end-users. We further devise new
objectives for targeted and untargeted attacks to a downstream video
classification service. Finally, we design an input-invariant perturbation that
universally disrupts video compression and classification systems in real time.
Unlike previously proposed attacks on video classification, our adversarial
perturbations are the first to withstand compression. We empirically show the
resilience of RoVISQ attacks against various defenses, i.e., adversarial
training, video denoising, and JPEG compression. Our extensive experimental
results on various video datasets show RoVISQ attacks deteriorate peak
signal-to-noise ratio by up to 5.6dB and the bit-rate by up to $\sim$
2.4$\times$ while achieving over 90$\%$ attack success rate on a downstream
classifier. Our user study further demonstrates the effect of RoVISQ attacks on
users' QoE.

light new physics weakly coupled to the Higgs. This study focuses on a scenario
in which the first-order EWPT is driven by a light scalar $s$ with a mass
between 15-60 GeV. A search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of
spin-zero particles, $h \to ss$, where the $s$-boson decays into $b$-quarks
promptly is presented. The search is performed in events where the Higgs boson
is produced in association with a $Z$ boson, giving rise to a signature of two
charged leptons (electrons or muons) and multiple jets from $b$-quark decays.
The analysis is considering a scenario of analysing 5000 fb$^{-1}$ $e^+ e^-$
collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 240 $ GeV from the Circular Electron Positron

expected sensitivity of probing the light scalars in the CEPC experiment. The

outer loop learns a meta-initialization of model parameters that is shared
across tasks, and the inner loop task-specific adaptation step. A variant of
MAML, Meta-SGD, uses the same two loop structure, but also learns the
learning-rate for the adaptation step. Little attention has been paid to how
the learned learning-rate of Meta-SGD affects feature reuse. In this paper, we
study the effect that a learned learning-rate has on the per-task feature
representations in Meta-SGD. The learned learning-rate of Meta-SGD often
contains negative values. During the adaptation phase, these negative learning
rates push features away from task-specific features and towards task-agnostic
features.
  We performed several experiments on the Mini-Imagenet dataset. Two neural
networks were trained, one with MAML, and one with Meta-SGD. The feature
quality for both models was tested as follows: strip away the linear
classification layer, pass labeled and unlabeled samples through this encoder,
classify the unlabeled samples according to their nearest neighbor. This
process was performed: 1) after training and using the meta-initialization
parameters; 2) after adaptation, and validated on that task; and 3) after
adaptation, and validated on a different task. The MAML trained model improved
on the task it was adapted to, but had worse performance on other tasks. The
Meta-SGD trained model was the opposite; it had worse performance on the task
it was adapted to, but improved on other tasks. This confirms the hypothesis
that Meta-SGD's negative learning rates cause the model to learn task-agnostic
features rather than simply adapt to task specific features.

replacing a memory device from pushdown stacks with access-controlled storage

induce the language family $k\mathrm{SDA}$. Similarly to $\mathrm{LOGDCFL}$, we
study the closure $\mathrm{LOG}k\mathrm{SDA}$ of all languages in
$k\mathrm{SDA}$ under $\mathrm{L}$-m-reductions. We demonstrate that
$\mathrm{DCFL}\subseteq k\mathrm{SDA}\subseteq \mathrm{SC}^k$ by significantly
extending Cook's early result (1979) of $\mathrm{DCFL}\subseteq \mathrm{SC}^2$.
The entire hierarch of $\mathrm{LOG}k\mathrm{SDA}$ for all $k\geq1$ therefore
lies between $\mathrm{LOGDCFL}$ and $\mathrm{SC}$. As an immediate consequence,
we obtain the same simulation bounds for Hibbard's limited automata. We further
characterize $\mathrm{LOG}k\mathrm{SDA}$ in terms of a new machine model,

microstructural regimes in pattern-forming processes are critical for
understanding and fabricating microstructurally precise novel materials in many
application domains. Unfortunately, relevant microstructure transitions may
depend on process parameters in subtle and complex ways that are not captured
by the classic theory of phase transition. While supervised machine learning
methods may be useful for identifying transition regimes, they need labels
which require prior knowledge of order parameters or relevant structures
describing these transitions. Motivated by the universality principle for
dynamical systems, we instead use a self-supervised approach to solve the
inverse problem of predicting process parameters from observed microstructures
using neural networks. This approach does not require predefined, labeled data
about the different classes of microstructural patterns or about the target
task of predicting microstructure transitions. We show that the difficulty of
performing the inverse-problem prediction task is related to the goal of
discovering microstructure regimes, because qualitative changes in
microstructural patterns correspond to changes in uncertainty predictions for
our self-supervised problem. We demonstrate the value of our approach by
automatically discovering transitions in microstructural regimes in two
distinct pattern-forming processes: the spinodal decomposition of a two-phase
mixture and the formation of concentration modulations of binary alloys during
physical vapor deposition of thin films. This approach opens a promising path
forward for discovering and understanding unseen or hard-to-discern transition
regimes, and ultimately for controlling complex pattern-forming processes.

games -- a novel setting using which many emerging problems in next-generation
electricity markets can be readily modeled. Repeated playing affords the
players a large class of strategies that adapt a player's actions to all past
observations and inferences obtained therefrom. In other settings such as
iterative auctions or dynamic games where a large strategy space of this sort
manifests, it typically has an important implication for mechanism design: It
may be impossible to obtain truth-telling as a dominant strategy equilibrium.
Consequently, in such scenarios, it is common to settle for mechanisms that
render truth-telling only a Nash equilibrium, or variants thereof, even though
Nash equilibria are known to be poor models of real-world behavior. This is
owing to each player having to make overly specific assumptions about the
behaviors of the other players to employ their Nash equilibrium strategy, which
they may not make. In general, the lesser the burden of speculation in an
equilibrium, the more plausible it is that it models real-world behavior.
Guided by this maxim, we introduce a new notion of equilibrium called Dominant
Strategy Non-Bankrupting Equilibrium (DNBE) which requires the players to make
very little assumptions about the behavior of the other players to employ their
equilibrium strategy. Consequently, a mechanism that renders truth-telling a
DNBE as opposed to only a Nash equilibrium could be quite effective in molding
real-world behavior along truthful lines. We present a mechanism for two-stage
repeated stochastic games that renders truth-telling a Dominant Strategy
Non-Bankrupting Equilibrium. The mechanism also guarantees individual
rationality and maximizes social welfare. Finally, we describe an application
of the mechanism to design demand response markets.

natural language process, and high-dimensional medical data analysis. Under the
causal direct acyclic graph (DAG) interpretation, the input variables without

randomized and independent of each other. As in a regression setting, including
the input variables in the DL algorithm would reduce the bias from the
potential confounders. However, failing to include a potential latent causal
structure among the input variables affecting both treatment assignment and the
output variable could be additional significant source of bias. The primary
goal of this study is to develop new DL algorithms to estimate causal
individual event times for time-to-event data, equivalently to estimate the
causal time-to-event distribution with or without right censoring, accounting
for the potential latent structure among the input variables. Once the causal
individual event times are estimated, it would be straightforward to estimate
the causal average treatment effects as the differences in the averages of the
estimated causal individual event times. A connection is made between the
proposed method and the targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE).
Simulation studies are performed to assess improvement in prediction abilities
of the proposed methods by using the mean square error (MSE)-based method and
rank-based $C$-Index metric. The simulation results indicate that improvement
on the prediction accuracy could be substantial particularly when there is a

proposed, where an atomic norm is defined with the parameter of the position

inflating a precomputed reachable set based on prior knowledge of the system's
trajectory deviation growth dynamics, depending on whether an inner
approximation or outer approximation is desired. These dynamics determine an
upper bound on the minimal deviation between two trajectories emanating from
the same point that are generated on the nominal system using nominal control
inputs, and by the impaired system based on the diminished set of control
inputs, respectively. The dynamics depend on the given Hausdorff distance bound
between the nominal set of admissible controls and the possibly unknown
impaired space of admissible controls, as well as a bound on the rate change
between the nominal and off-nominal dynamics. Because of its computational
efficiency compared to direct computation of the off-nominal reachable set,
this procedure can be applied to on-board fault-tolerant path planning and
failure recovery. In addition, the proposed algorithm does not require
convexity of the reachable sets unlike our previous work, thereby making it

phases of the reflected signals at the RIS elements to realize the multiple
measurements. Moreover, an atomic norm-based method is proposed for the DOA
estimation by exploiting the target sparsity in the spatial domain and solved
by a semi-definite programming (SDP) method. Furthermore, the RIS elements can
be any geometry array for practical consideration, so a transformation matrix
is formulated and different from the conventional SDP method. Simulation

the existing methods in the non-uniform linear RIS array.

in this paper a new integrated \emph{periodic} sensing and communication

infinite number of variables, we obtain the optimal transmit precoder and
derive the optimal achievable rate in closed-form for any given UAV location to
facilitate the UAV trajectory design. Furthermore, we first prove the
structural symmetry between optimal solutions in different ISAC frames without

more flexible trade-off in ISAC systems over benchmark schemes.

(PWPFZF), and local regularized ZF (LRZF) combining by exploiting channel
statistics. We derive closed-form expressions of the uplink SE for FZF, PFZF,

fading channels, taking channel estimation errors and pilot contamination into
account. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the number of pilot sequences,
antennas per AP, and APs on the performance. Numerical results show that LRZF
provides the highest SE. However, PWPFZF is preferable when the number of pilot
sequences is large and the number of antennas per AP is small. The reason is
that PWPFZF has lower computational complexity and the SE expression can be
computed in closed-form. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of PWPFZF
combining with fractional power control and the numerical results show that it
improves the performance of weak UEs and realizes uniformly good service for

the fast remote read capability of RDMA and partial state transfer across
serverless containers, MITOSIS bridges the performance gap between local and
remote container initialization. MITOSIS is the first to fork over 10,000 new
containers from one instance across multiple machines within a second, while
allowing the new containers to efficiently transfer the pre-materialized states
of the forked one. We have implemented MITOSIS on Linux and integrated it with
FN, a popular serverless platform. Under load spikes in real-world serverless

interactive environmental states of static and dynamic obstacles, respectively;
(2) developing a bidirectional recurrent module based neural network, which
maps the states of a varying number of surrounding obstacles to the actions
directly; (3) developing a RVO area and expected collision time based reward

Correlating data from different Internet observatories and outposts can be a
useful tool for gaining insights into these distributions. This work compares
observed sources from the largest Internet telescope (the CAIDA darknet
telescope) with those from a commercial outpost (the GreyNoise honeyfarm).
Neither of these locations actively emit Internet traffic and provide distinct
observations of unsolicited Internet traffic (primarily botnets and scanners).
Newly developed GraphBLAS hyperspace matrices and D4M associative array
technologies enable the efficient analysis of these data on significant scales.
The CAIDA sources are well approximated by a Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution. Over
a 6-month period 70\% of the brightest (highest frequency) sources in the CAIDA
telescope are consistently detected by coeval observations in the GreyNoise
honeyfarm. This overlap drops as the sources dim (reduce frequency) and as the
time difference between the observations grows. The probability of seeing a
CAIDA source is proportional to the logarithm of the brightness. The temporal
correlations are well described by a modified Cauchy distribution. These
observations are consistent with a correlated high frequency beam of sources
that drifts on a time scale of a month.

factors in the low-cost systems, including the antenna position perturbations,
the inconsistent gains/phases, the mutual coupling effect, the nonlinear
amplifier effect, etc., the performance of the DOA estimation often degrades
significantly. To characterize the realistic array more accurately, a novel
deep learning (DL)-based DOA estimation method named super-resolution DOA
network (SDOAnet) is proposed in this paper. Different from the existing
DL-based DOA methods, our proposed SDOAnet employs the sampled received
signals, instead of the covariance matrices of the received signals, as the
input of the convolution layers for extracting data features. Moreover, the
output of SDOAnet is a vector that is independent of the DOA of targets but can
be used to estimate their spatial spectrum. As a result, the same training
network can be applied with any number of targets, which significantly reduce
the implementation complexity. At last, the convergence speed of our SDOAnet
with a low-dimension network structure is much faster than existing DL-based
methods. Simulation results show that the proposed SDOAnet outperforms the
existing DOA estimation methods with the effect of the imperfect array. The

plates. We wish to preprocess $\mathcal{T}$ into a data structure so that for a
query object $\gamma$, which is also a plate, we can quickly answer various
intersection queries, such as detecting whether $\gamma$ intersects any plate
of $\mathcal{T}$, reporting all the plates intersected by $\gamma$, or counting
them. We also consider two simpler cases of this general setting: (i) the input
objects are plates and the query objects are constant-degree parametrized
algebraic arcs in $\mathbb{R}^3$ (arcs, for short), or (ii) the input objects
are arcs and the query objects are plates in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Besides being
interesting in their own right, the data structures for these two special cases
form the building blocks for handling the general case.
  By combining the polynomial-partitioning technique with additional tools from
real algebraic geometry, we present many different data structures for
intersection queries, which also provide trade-offs between their size and
query time. The performance of these data structures depends on the complexity
of the input and query objects. For example, if $\mathcal{T}$ is a set of
plates and the query objects are algebraic arcs, we obtain a data structure
that uses $O^*(n^{4/3})$ storage (where the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation hides
subpolynomial factors) and answers an arc-intersection query in $O^*(n^{2/3})$
time. Alternatively, for a parameter $s\in [n^{4/3}, n^t]$ where $t\ge 3$ is
the number of real parameters needed to specify a query arc, the query time can
be decreased to $O^*((n^t/s)^{\tfrac{2}{3(t-1)}})$ by increasing the storage to
$O^*(s)$.

Transformers divide images into the same number of patches with a fixed size,
which may not be optimal for restoring patches with different levels of texture
richness. This paper presents HIPA, a novel Transformer architecture that
progressively recovers the high resolution image using a hierarchical patch
partition. Specifically, we build a cascaded model that processes an input
image in multiple stages, where we start with tokens with small patch sizes and
gradually merge to the full resolution. Such a hierarchical patch mechanism not
only explicitly enables feature aggregation at multiple resolutions but also
adaptively learns patch-aware features for different image regions, e.g., using
a smaller patch for areas with fine details and a larger patch for textureless
regions. Meanwhile, a new attention-based position encoding scheme for
Transformer is proposed to let the network focus on which tokens should be paid
more attention by assigning different weights to different tokens, which is the
first time to our best knowledge. Furthermore, we also propose a new
multi-reception field attention module to enlarge the convolution reception
field from different branches. The experimental results on several public

and cross-lingual transfer research where the supervision is transferred from
high-resource languages (HRLs) to low-resource languages (LRLs). However, the
cross-lingual transfer is not uniform across languages, particularly in the
zero-shot setting. Towards this goal, one promising research direction is to
learn shareable structures across multiple tasks with limited annotated data.
The downstream multilingual applications may benefit from such a learning setup
as most of the languages across the globe are low-resource and share some
structures with other languages. In this paper, we propose a novel
meta-learning framework (called Meta-X$_{NLG}$) to learn shareable structures
from typologically diverse languages based on meta-learning and language
clustering. This is a step towards uniform cross-lingual transfer for unseen
languages. We first cluster the languages based on language representations and
identify the centroid language of each cluster. Then, a meta-learning algorithm
is trained with all centroid languages and evaluated on the other languages in
the zero-shot setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this modeling on two
NLG tasks (Abstractive Text Summarization and Question Generation), 5 popular
datasets and 30 typologically diverse languages. Consistent improvements over
strong baselines demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The
careful design of the model makes this end-to-end NLG setup less vulnerable to
the accidental translation problem, which is a prominent concern in zero-shot
cross-lingual NLG tasks.

In this paper, we aim to draw a link between the simulations and the observable
signatures of jet-ISM interactions by analyzing the emission morphology and gas
kinematics resulting from jet-induced shocks in simulated disc and spherical
systems. We find that the jet-induced laterally expanding forward shock of the
energy bubble sweeping through the ISM causes large-scale outflows, creating
shocked emission and high-velocity dispersion in the entire nuclear regions
($\sim2$ kpcs) of their hosts. The jetted systems exhibit larger velocity
widths (> 800 km/s), broader Position-Velocity maps and distorted symmetry in
the disc's projected velocities than systems without a jet. We also investigate
the above quantities at different inclination angles of the observer with
respect to the galaxy. Jets inclined to the gas disc of its host are found to
be confined for longer times, and consequently couple more strongly with the
disc gas. This results in prominent shocked emission and high-velocity widths,
not only along the jet's path, but also in the regions perpendicular to them.
Strong interaction of the jet with a gas disc can also distort its morphology.
However, after the jets escape their initial confinement, the jet-disc coupling
is weakened, thereby lowering the shocked emission and velocity widths.

theoretical analysis reveals that DR usually has a large variance. Meanwhile,
DR would suffer unexpectedly large bias and poor generalization caused by
inaccurate imputed errors and learned propensities, which usually occur in

reduce bias and variance simultaneously for existing DR approaches when the
error imputation model is misspecified. In addition, we further propose a novel

logical rulebase containing rules and statements written in natural language.
Recent works show that such models can also produce the reasoning steps (i.e.,
the proof graph) that emulate the model's logical reasoning process. Currently,
these black-box models generate both the proof graph and intermediate
inferences within the same model and thus may be unfaithful. In this work, we
frame the deductive logical reasoning task by defining three modular
components: rule selection, fact selection, and knowledge composition. The rule
and fact selection steps select the candidate rule and facts to be used and
then the knowledge composition combines them to generate new inferences. This
ensures model faithfulness by assured causal relation from the proof step to
the inference reasoning. To test our framework, we propose FaiRR (Faithful and
Robust Reasoner) where the above three components are independently modeled by
transformers. We observe that FaiRR is robust to novel language perturbations,
and is faster at inference than previous works on existing reasoning datasets.
Additionally, in contrast to black-box generative models, the errors made by
FaiRR are more interpretable due to the modular approach.

efficient algorithms for computing the truncated SVD of large data matrices.
Given a $n \times n$ symmetric matrix $\mathbf{M}$, the prototypical RSVD
algorithm outputs an approximation of the $k$ leading singular vectors of
$\mathbf{M}$ by computing the SVD of $\mathbf{M}^{g} \mathbf{G}$; here $g \geq
1$ is an integer and $\mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ is a random
Gaussian sketching matrix. In this paper we study the statistical properties of
RSVD under a general ""signal-plus-noise"" framework, i.e., the observed matrix
$\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ is assumed to be an additive perturbation of some true but
unknown signal matrix $\mathbf{M}$. We first derive upper bounds for the
$\ell_2$ (spectral norm) and $\ell_{2\to\infty}$ (maximum row-wise $\ell_2$
norm) distances between the approximate singular vectors of $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$
and the true singular vectors of the signal matrix $\mathbf{M}$. These upper
bounds depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of power
iterations $g$. A phase transition phenomenon is observed in which a smaller
SNR requires larger values of $g$ to guarantee convergence of the $\ell_2$ and
$\ell_{2\to\infty}$ distances. We also show that the thresholds for $g$ where
these phase transitions occur are sharp whenever the noise matrices satisfy a
certain trace growth condition. Finally, we derive normal approximations for
the row-wise fluctuations of the approximate singular vectors and the entrywise
fluctuations of the approximate matrix. We illustrate our theoretical results
by deriving nearly-optimal performance guarantees for RSVD when applied to
three statistical inference problems, namely, community detection, matrix
completion, and principal component analysis with missing data.

enable gradient-based optimization, which is invaluable for calibrating

DiSECt: the first differentiable simulator for cutting soft materials. The
simulator augments the finite element method (FEM) with a continuous contact
model based on signed distance fields (SDF), as well as a continuous damage
model that inserts springs on opposite sides of the cutting plane and allows
them to weaken until zero stiffness, enabling crack formation. Through various
experiments, we evaluate the performance of the simulator. We first show that
the simulator can be calibrated to match resultant forces and deformation
fields from a state-of-the-art commercial solver and real-world cutting
datasets, with generality across cutting velocities and object instances. We
then show that Bayesian inference can be performed efficiently by leveraging
the differentiability of the simulator, estimating posteriors over hundreds of
parameters in a fraction of the time of derivative-free methods. Next, we
illustrate that control parameters in the simulation can be optimized to
minimize cutting forces via lateral slicing motions. Finally, we conduct
experiments on a real robot arm equipped with a slicing knife to infer
simulation parameters from force measurements. By optimizing the slicing motion
of the knife, we show on fruit cutting scenarios that the average knife force

important trend. Realizing different types of sensing and achieving mutual
enhancement under the existing communication hardware architecture is a crucial
challenge in realizing the deep integration of sensing and communication. In
the 5G New Radio context, active sensing can be performed through uplink beam
sweeping on the user equipment (UE) side to observe the surrounding
environment. In addition, the UE can perform passive sensing through downlink
channel estimation to measure the multipath component (MPC) information. This
study is the first to develop a hybrid simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM) mechanism that combines active and passive sensing, in which mutual
enhancement between the two sensing modes is realized in communication systems.
Specifically, we first establish a common feature associated with the
reflective surface to bridge active and passive sensing, thus enabling
information fusion. Based on the common feature, we can attain physical anchor
initialization through MPC with the assistance of active sensing. Then, we
extend the classic probabilistic data association SLAM mechanism to achieve UE
localization and continuously refine the physical anchor and target reflections
through the subsequent passive sensing. Numerical results show that the
proposed hybrid active and passive sensing-based SLAM mechanism can work
successfully in tricky scenarios without any prior information on the floor
plan, anchors, or agents. Moreover, the proposed algorithm demonstrates
significant performance gains compared with active or passive sensing only
mechanisms.

  context of uncertainty quantification",,,,,"math.AP cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A crucial role in the theory of uncertainty quantification (UQ) of PDEs is
played by the regularity of the solution with respect to the stochastic
parameters; indeed, a key property one seeks to establish is that the solution
is holomorphic with respect to (the complex extensions of) the parameters. In
the context of UQ for the high-frequency Helmholtz equation, a natural question
is therefore: how does this parametric holomorphy depend on the wavenumber $k$?
  The recent paper [Ganesh, Kuo, Sloan 2021] showed for a particular
nontrapping variable-coefficient Helmholtz problem with affine dependence of
the coefficients on the stochastic parameters that the solution operator can be
analytically continued a distance $\sim k^{-1}$ into the complex plane.
  In this paper, we generalise the result in [Ganesh, Kuo, Sloan 2021] about
$k$-explicit parametric holomorphy to a much wider class of Helmholtz problems
with arbitrary (holomorphic) dependence on the stochastic parameters; we show
that in all cases the region of parametric holomorphy decreases with $k$, and
show how the rate of decrease with $k$ is dictated by whether the unperturbed
Helmholtz problem is trapping or nontrapping. We then give examples of both
trapping and nontrapping problems where these bounds on the rate of decrease
with $k$ of the region of parametric holomorphy are sharp, with the trapping
examples coming from the recent results of [Galkowski, Marchand, Spence 2021].
  An immediate implication of these results is that the $k$-dependent
restrictions imposed on the randomness in the analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo
(QMC) methods in [Ganesh, Kuo, Sloan 2021] arise from a genuine feature of the
Helmholtz equation with $k$ large (and not, for example, a suboptimal bound).

calculation of its finite size effect (FSE) is challenging. So far only the FSE
in a single interval in the XX model has been understood and the FSE in the
other models and in the other conditions are totally unknown. Here we report
the FSE of this entropy in disjointed intervals $A = \cup_i A_i$ under a
uniform dilation $\lambda A$ in the XY model, showing of a universal scaling
law as
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta_{\lambda A}^\alpha = \Delta_A^\alpha \lambda^{-\eta} \mathcal{B}(A,

\text{min}(2, 2/\alpha)$ when $\alpha < 10$. We verify this relation in the
phase boundaries of the XY model, in which the different central charges
correspond to the physics of free Fermion and free Boson models. We find that
in the disjointed intervals, two FSEs, termed as extrinsic FSE and intrinsic
FSE, are required to fully account for the FSE of the entropy. Physically, we
find that only the edge modes of the correlation matrix localized at the open
ends $\partial A$ have contribution to the total entropy and its FSE. Our

semantic segmentation (WSSS) and semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS),
is a challenging task that has attracted much attention recently. Most leading
WSSS methods employ a sophisticated multi-stage training strategy to estimate
pseudo-labels as precise as possible, but they suffer from high model
complexity. In contrast, there exists another research line that trains a
single network with image-level labels in one training cycle. However, such a
single-stage strategy often performs poorly because of the compounding effect
caused by inaccurate pseudo-label estimation. To address this issue, this paper
presents a Self-supervised Low-Rank Network (SLRNet) for single-stage WSSS and
SSSS. The SLRNet uses cross-view self-supervision, that is, it simultaneously
predicts several complementary attentive LR representations from different
views of an image to learn precise pseudo-labels. Specifically, we reformulate
the LR representation learning as a collective matrix factorization problem and
optimize it jointly with the network learning in an end-to-end manner. The
resulting LR representation deprecates noisy information while capturing stable
semantics across different views, making it robust to the input variations,
thereby reducing overfitting to self-supervision errors. The SLRNet can provide
a unified single-stage framework for various label-efficient semantic
segmentation settings: 1) WSSS with image-level labeled data, 2) SSSS with a
few pixel-level labeled data, and 3) SSSS with a few pixel-level labeled data
and many image-level labeled data. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC
2012, COCO, and L2ID datasets demonstrate that our SLRNet outperforms both
state-of-the-art WSSS and SSSS methods with a variety of different settings,
proving its good generalizability and efficacy.

detonation wave (RDW) of kerosene/oxygen-enriched air at normal temperature.
Two types of combustors without and with the inlet mixing section (IMS) are
constructed to illustrate the effect of IMS on the combustion characteristics
of two-phase RDW. The important role of the preheating zone in the IMS after
the back-propagation shock on the droplet evaporation is analyzed. The
parameter sensitivity of RDW propagation stability to the average droplet
diameter d0 is further discussed. Results show that the droplets mainly
evaporate after the detonation front in the combustor without IMS, and the
reaction heat release is completed in a short distance, which propels
continuous propagation of the detonation wave. When d0 gradually increases, the
droplet evaporation distance increases, and the coupling between the incident
shock and reaction is continuously weakened, finally resulting in the
detonation quenching. In the combustor with IMS, a preheating zone is induced
close to the contact surface by the back-propagation shock of the RDW. A large
number of droplets evaporate in this zone, and generate sufficient mixture of
fuel vapor and oxidizer in front of detonation wave to maintain the detonation
propagation. Priority to the combustor without IMS, the droplet evaporation
relies less on the inlet high-temperature airflow with the assistance of
preheating zone, and thus the wave propagation stability can be enhanced and
the RDW can sustain for a wider range of d0. The present analysis provides a
new understanding of two-phase rotating detonation systems.

ETL pipelines. (Villaca et al 2020, Oliveira et al 2019) However, a mapping to
a CDM is complex. (Lemcke et al 2012) There are three complexity problems,
namely the size of the required mapping matrix, the automation of updates of
the matrix in response to changes in the extraction sources and the time
efficiency of the mapping. In this paper, we present a new solution for these
problems. More precisely, we present a new dynamic mapping matrix (DMM), which
is based on permutation matrices that are obtained by block-partitioning the
full mapping matrix. We show that the DMM can be used for automated updates in

highly efficient compacting. For the solution, we draw on research into matrix
partitioning (Quinn 2004) and dynamic networks (Haase et al 2021). The DMM has

strongly rely on the ground-truth (GT) intermediate frames, which sometimes
ignore the non-unique nature of motion judging from the given adjacent frames.
As a result, these methods tend to produce averaged solutions that are not
clear enough. To alleviate this issue, we propose to relax the requirement of
reconstructing an intermediate frame as close to the GT as possible. Towards
this end, we develop a texture consistency loss (TCL) upon the assumption that
the interpolated content should maintain similar structures with their
counterparts in the given frames. Predictions satisfying this constraint are
encouraged, though they may differ from the pre-defined GT. Without the bells
and whistles, our plug-and-play TCL is capable of improving the performance of
existing VFI frameworks. On the other hand, previous methods usually adopt the
cost volume or correlation map to achieve more accurate image/feature warping.
However, the O(N^2) ({N refers to the pixel count}) computational complexity
makes it infeasible for high-resolution cases. In this work, we design a
simple, efficient (O(N)) yet powerful cross-scale pyramid alignment (CSPA)

based on the $t$-channel unitarity, we expressed the exchange of the soft
Pomeron through the interaction of the dipole of small size of the order of
$1/Q_s(Y)$ ($Q_s(Y)$ is the saturation momentum) with the hadrons. Therefore,
it is shown that the typical distances in soft processes are small $r \sim

determines the energy dependence of the scattering amplitude is proportional to
$ Q^2_s\Lb \h Y \Rb \propto\,\exp\Lb\h \lambda\,Y\Rb$, with $\lambda

learn novel classes from only a few examples while not forgetting the base
classes on which it was pre-trained. Our study reveals that the challenges of
IFSL lie in both inter-class separation and novel-class representation. Dur to
intra-class variation, a novel class may implicitly leverage the knowledge from
multiple base classes to construct its feature representation. Hence, simply
reusing the pre-trained embedding space could lead to a scattered feature
distribution and result in category confusion. To address such issues, we
propose a two-step learning strategy referred to as \textbf{Im}planting and
\textbf{Co}mpressing (\textbf{IMCO}), which optimizes both feature space
partition and novel class reconstruction in a systematic manner. Specifically,
in the \textbf{Implanting} step, we propose to mimic the data distribution of
novel classes with the assistance of data-abundant base set, so that a model
could learn semantically-rich features that are beneficial for discriminating
between the base and other unseen classes. In the \textbf{Compressing} step, we
adapt the feature extractor to precisely represent each novel class for
enhancing intra-class compactness, together with a regularized parameter
updating rule for preventing aggressive model updating. Finally, we demonstrate
that IMCO outperforms competing baselines with a significant margin, both in

terahertz (0.1--10 THz) band to satisfy the extreme latency and bandwidth
density requirements of future applications. However, the development of
systems in this band is challenging as THz waves confront severe spreading and
penetration losses, as well as molecular absorption, which leads to strong
line-of-sight requirements through highly directive antennas. Recently,
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been proposed to address issues
derived from non-line-of-sight propagation, among other impairments, by
redirecting the incident wave toward the receiver and implementing
virtual-line-of-sight communications. However, the benefits provided by a RIS
may be lost if the network operates at multiple bands. In this position paper,
the suitability of the RIS paradigm in indoor THz scenarios for 6G is assessed
grounded on the analysis of a tunable graphene-based RIS that can operate in
multiple wideband transparency windows. A possible implementation of such a RIS
is provided and numerically evaluated at 0.65/0.85/1.05 THz separately,
demonstrating that beam steering and other relevant functionalities are
realizable with excellent performance. Finally, the challenges associated with
the design and fabrication of multi-wideband graphene-based RISs are discussed,
paving the way to the concurrent control of multiple THz bands in the context
of 6G networks.

applications, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and probabilistic

most DAG encoders use an asynchronous message passing scheme which sequentially
processes nodes according to the dependency between nodes in a DAG. That is, a

result, they are inherently not parallelizable. In this work, we propose a
Parallelizable Attention-based Computation structure Encoder (PACE) that
processes nodes simultaneously and encodes DAGs in parallel. We demonstrate the
superiority of PACE through encoder-dependent optimization subroutines that
search the optimal DAG structure based on the learned DAG embeddings.

periodic orbits in periodically excited linear systems with matched
uncertainties to a larger class of periodically excited nonlinear systems with
matched uncertainties and known structure. A candidate adaptive feedback design
is also proposed in the case of scalar problems with unmodeled nonlinearities.
In the former case, rigorous analysis shows guaranteed performance bounds for
the associated prediction and estimation errors. Together with an assumption of
persistent excitation, there follows asymptotic convergence to periodic
responses determined uniquely by an a priori unknown periodic reference input
and independent of initial conditions, as required by the control-based
continuation paradigm. In particular, when the reference input equals the
sought periodic response, the steady-state control input vanishes. Identical
conclusions follow for the case of scalar dynamics with unmodeled
nonlinearities, albeit with slow rates of convergence. Numerical simulations
validate the theoretical predictions for individual parameter values.
Integration with the software package COCO demonstrate successful continuation
along families of stable and unstable periodic orbits with a minimum of
parameter tuning. The results expand the envelope of known noninvasive feedback
strategies for use in experimental model validation and engineering design.

However, it is cumbersome to compute the self-attention on large-scale point

3D space. To solve this issue, existing methods usually compute self-attention
locally by grouping the points into clusters of the same size, or perform
convolutional self-attention on a discretized representation. However, the
former results in stochastic point dropout, while the latter typically has
narrow attention fields. In this paper, we propose a novel voxel-based
architecture, namely Voxel Set Transformer (VoxSeT), to detect 3D objects from
point clouds by means of set-to-set translation. VoxSeT is built upon a
voxel-based set attention (VSA) module, which reduces the self-attention in
each voxel by two cross-attentions and models features in a hidden space
induced by a group of latent codes. With the VSA module, VoxSeT can manage
voxelized point clusters with arbitrary size in a wide range, and process them
in parallel with linear complexity. The proposed VoxSeT integrates the high
performance of transformer with the efficiency of voxel-based model, which can
be used as a good alternative to the convolutional and point-based backbones.

thus two-way classical communication, on higher nesting levels. Within this
framework, we identify the essential properties of any optimal repeater scheme:
entanglement distribution in parallel, entanglement swapping as soon and
parallel quantum storage as little as possible. While these features are
obvious or trivial for the simplest repeater with one middle station, for more
stations they cannot always be combined. We propose an optimal scheme including
channel loss and memory dephasing, proving its optimality for the case of two
stations and conjecturing it for the general case. In an even more realistic
setting, we consider additional tools and parameters such as memory cut-offs,
multiplexing, initial state and swapping gate fidelities, and finite link
coupling efficiencies in order to identify potential regimes in memory-assisted
quantum key distribution beyond one middle station that exceed the rates of the
smallest quantum repeaters as well as those obtainable in all-optical schemes
unassisted by stationary memory qubits and two-way classical communication.

the data anonymization process. To preserve differential privacy, a random

privacy level and data utility is of great concern. The privacy and utility
properties for the continuous noise adding mechanism have been well studied.
However, the related works are insufficient for the discrete random mechanism
on discretely distributed data, e.g., traffic data, health records. This paper
focuses on the discrete random noise adding mechanisms. We study the basic
differential privacy conditions and properties for the general discrete random
mechanisms, as well as the trade-off between data privacy and data utility.
Specifically, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition for discrete
epsilon-differential privacy and a sufficient condition for discrete (epsilon,
delta)-differential privacy, with the numerical estimation of differential
privacy parameters. These conditions can be applied to analyze the differential
privacy properties for the discrete noise adding mechanisms with various kinds
of noises. Then, with the differential privacy guarantees, we propose an
optimal discrete epsilon-differential private noise adding mechanism under the

the stochastic optimization literature, it has been proposed to instead use
truncated linear lower bounds, which produce better performance by more closely

problem of overshooting the minimum of the loss function. Unfortunately,
truncated linear models cannot be used with parameter-free algorithms because

efficiency, where privacy security is especially important to VFL. However, to
the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a VFL algorithm satisfying all
these criteria very well. To address this challenging problem, in this paper,
we reveal that zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is a desirable companion for

2) prevent VFL framework from privacy leakage under curious, colluding, and
malicious threat models, 3) support inexpensive communication and efficient

length $n$, rate $R$, and distance $\delta n$. This means that for every
$0<k<\delta n$, every $m\times k$ submatrix of $A$ has a row of odd weight.
Message-passing decoding algorithms require the stronger unique-neighbor
property. Namely, that every such submatrix has a row of weight $1$. This
concept arises naturally in the context of efficient decoding of LDPC expander
codes as well as in the study of codes for the binary erasure channel, where
$A$ is said to have stopping distance $\delta n$. It is well known that if
$\frac12\le\delta$, then $R=o_n(1)$ whereas for every $\delta<\frac12$ there
exist linear codes of length $n\to\infty$ and distance $\ge\delta n$ with $R$
bounded away from zero. We believe that the unique-neighbor property entails
sharper upper bounds on the rate. Concretely, we conjecture that for a proper
choice of $f(m) = o(m)$ and some positive constant $\epsilon_0$, every
$m\times(m+f(m))$ binary matrix has an $m\times m'$ submatrix with
$0<m'\le(\frac12-\epsilon_0)m$ where no row has weight $1$. In other words,
that every linear code of non-vanishing rate has a normalized stopping distance
of at most $\frac12-\epsilon_0$. We make several contributions to the study of
this conjecture. Concretely, we (1) prove the conjecture for sufficiently dense
matrices (2) find tight upper bounds for the stopping distance of matrices in
standard form, and prove the conjecture in this special case (3) show that the
conjecture can hold only if $f(t)\ge\log_2(t)$ (4) find tight upper bounds for
both distance and stopping distance of matrices where $n-m$ is small, and
provide minimal $(m,n)$ where the upper bound on the stopping distance is
strictly smaller than that of the distance of such matrices.

generalization capability of the deep model is becoming a public concern.
Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has emerged in recent years to equip the deep model
with the ability to recognize unseen classes. However, existing studies mainly
focus on natural images, which utilize linguistic models to extract auxiliary
information for ZSL. It is impractical to apply the natural image ZSL solutions
directly to medical images, since the medical terminology is very
domain-specific, and it is not easy to acquire linguistic models for the
medical terminology. In this work, we propose a new paradigm of ZSL
specifically for medical images utilizing cross-modality information. We make
three main contributions with the proposed paradigm. First, we extract the
prior knowledge about the segmentation targets, called relation prototypes,
from the prior model and then propose a cross-modality adaptation module to
inherit the prototypes to the zero-shot model. Second, we propose a relation
prototype awareness module to make the zero-shot model aware of information
contained in the prototypes. Last but not least, we develop an inheritance
attention module to recalibrate the relation prototypes to enhance the
inheritance process. The proposed framework is evaluated on two public
cross-modality datasets including a cardiac dataset and an abdominal dataset.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework significantly

computer vision. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently proven to
be capable of predicting reliable 6D pose estimates even under monocular
settings. Nonetheless, CNNs are identified as being extremely data-driven, and
acquiring adequate annotations is oftentimes very time-consuming and labor
intensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel monocular 6D pose
estimation approach by means of self-supervised learning, removing the need for
real annotations. After training our proposed network fully supervised with
synthetic RGB data, we leverage current trends in noisy student training and
differentiable rendering to further self-supervise the model on these
unsupervised real RGB(-D) samples, seeking for a visually and geometrically
optimal alignment. Moreover, employing both visible and amodal mask
information, our self-supervision becomes very robust towards challenging
scenarios such as occlusion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our
proposed self-supervision outperforms all other methods relying on synthetic
data or employing elaborate techniques from the domain adaptation realm.
Noteworthy, our self-supervised approach consistently improves over its
synthetically trained baseline and often almost closes the gap towards its
fully supervised counterpart. The code and models are publicly available at

establishing a computer-assisted proof technique for bounding the norm of the

application of a constructive version of the implicit function theorem. While
these results are only applied to the triblock copolymer case, we demonstrate

distinguishing in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, using
only available ID samples. Recently, large gains were made on this task for the
domain of natural images using self-supervised contrastive feature learning as
a first step followed by kNN or traditional one-class classifiers for feature
scoring. Learned representations that are non-uniformly distributed on the unit
hypersphere have been shown to be beneficial for this task. We go a step
further and investigate how the \emph {geometrical compactness} of the ID
feature distribution makes isolating and detecting outliers easier, especially
in the realistic situation when ID training data is polluted (i.e. ID data
contains some OOD data that is used for learning the feature extractor
parameters). We propose novel architectural modifications to the
self-supervised feature learning step, that enable such compact distributions
for ID data to be learned. We show that the proposed modifications can be
effectively applied to most existing self-supervised objectives, with large
gains in performance. Furthermore, this improved OOD performance is obtained
without resorting to tricks such as using strongly augmented ID images (e.g. by
90 degree rotations) as proxies for the unseen OOD data, as these impose overly
prescriptive assumptions about ID data and its invariances. We perform
extensive studies on benchmark datasets for one-class OOD detection and show
state-of-the-art performance in the presence of pollution in the ID data, and
comparable performance otherwise. We also propose and extensively evaluate a
novel feature scoring technique based on the angular Mahalanobis distance, and
propose a simple and novel technique for feature ensembling during evaluation
that enables a big boost in performance at nearly zero run-time cost.

anomaly detector to force generating augmented data that are distinguished as
non-natural, which brings larger gains to the accuracy of PrLMs. (2) We apply
the anomaly detector to a defense framework to enhance the robustness of PrLMs.
It can be used to defend all types of attacks and achieves higher accuracy on

common consensus in the graph node classification task is that GNNs perform
well on homophilic graphs but may fail on heterophilic graphs with many
inter-class edges. However, the previous inter-class edges perspective and
related homo-ratio metrics cannot well explain the GNNs performance under some
heterophilic datasets, which implies that not all the inter-class edges are
harmful to GNNs. In this work, we propose a new metric based on von Neumann
entropy to re-examine the heterophily problem of GNNs and investigate the
feature aggregation of inter-class edges from an entire neighbor identifiable
perspective. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective Conv-Agnostic GNN
framework (CAGNNs) to enhance the performance of most GNNs on heterophily
datasets by learning the neighbor effect for each node. Specifically, we first
decouple the feature of each node into the discriminative feature for
downstream tasks and the aggregation feature for graph convolution. Then, we
propose a shared mixer module to adaptively evaluate the neighbor effect of
each node to incorporate the neighbor information. The proposed framework can
be regarded as a plug-in component and is compatible with most GNNs. The
experimental results over nine well-known benchmark datasets indicate that our

graphs. The average performance gain is 9.81%, 25.81%, and 20.61% compared with
GIN, GAT, and GCN, respectively. Extensive ablation studies and robustness

convex relaxation. The cost function, referred to as the Sum-of-Infeasibilities
(SoI), is designed so that its minimum is zero and achieved only if all the
activation functions are satisfied. We propose a stochastic procedure, DeepSoI,
to efficiently minimize the SoI. An extension to a canonical
case-analysis-based complete search procedure can be achieved by replacing the
convex procedure executed at each search state with DeepSoI. Extending the
complete search with DeepSoI achieves multiple simultaneous goals: 1) it guides
the search towards a counter-example; 2) it enables more informed branching
decisions; and 3) it creates additional opportunities for bound derivation. An
extensive evaluation across different benchmarks and solvers demonstrates the
benefit of the proposed techniques. In particular, we demonstrate that SoI
significantly improves the performance of an existing complete search

memory may be quantum and produce short-term memory, and exhibits an
exponential decay in the wave function over a period of time, produced in the
hippocampus. And exponential decay occurs due to barriers, and barriers can
refer to astrocytes. Brain plasticity in working memory flows through the
brain, from the hippocampus to the cortex, through directional derivatives. The
strong working memory brain plasticity turns to long-term memory means maximum
of directional derivatives, and maximum of directional derivatives is gradient.
Thus, long-term memory signifies the gradient of brain plasticity in working
memory. The process of short-term memory turns to long-term memory is the
process of non-classically turns to classically. Astrocytic cortex memory

inspires experiments. This could be the process of astrocytes phagocytose

systems from a new perspective of metric learning via implicit feedback. We
develop and investigate a personalizable deep metric model that captures both
the internal contents of items and how they were interacted with by users.
There are two key challenges in learning such model. First, there is no
explicit similarity annotation, which deviates from the assumption of most
metric learning methods. Second, these approaches ignore the fact that items
are often represented by multiple sources of meta data and different users use
different combinations of these sources to form their own notion of similarity.
  To address these challenges, we develop a new metric representation embedded
as kernel parameters of a probabilistic model. This helps express the
correlation between items that a user has interacted with, which can be used to
predict user interaction with new items. Our approach hinges on the intuition
that similar items induce similar interactions from the same user, thus fitting
a metric-parameterized model to predict an implicit feedback signal could
indirectly guide it towards finding the most suitable metric for each user. To
this end, we also analyze how and when the proposed method is effective from a
theoretical lens. Its empirical effectiveness is also demonstrated on several
real-world datasets.

OTDR traces are prone to be distorted by different kinds of noise, causing
blurring of the backscattered signals, and thereby leading to a misleading
interpretation and a more cumbersome event detection task. To address this
problem, a novel method combining a denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE)

proposed approach is applied to noisy OTDR signals of different levels of input
SNR ranging from -5 dB to 15 dB. The experimental results demonstrate that: (i)
the DCAE is efficient in denoising the OTDR traces and it outperforms other
deep learning techniques and the conventional denoising methods; and (ii) the

maintaining complex data structures and explicit data migration by enabling
on-demand data movement between CPU memory and GPU memory. However, on-demand
paging soon becomes a performance bottleneck of UVM due to the high latency
caused by page table walks and data migration over interconnect. Prefetching is
considered a promising solution to this problem given its ability to leverage
the locality of program memory access patterns. However, existing
locality-based prefetching schemes can not handle all the situations. %Data
structures like arrays tend to be stored in contiguous blocks, and accessed
repeatedly. An ideal prefetcher should not only look at narrow regions of the
requested address space but also capture global context to deliver a good
prediction of the memory access pattern.
  This paper proposes a novel approach for page prefetching for UVM through
deep learning. We first show that a powerful Transformer learning model can
provide high accuracy for UVM page prefetching. We then perform analysis to
interpret this Transformer model and derive several insights that allow us to
design a simpler model to match the unconstrained model's accuracy with orders
of magnitude lower cost. We evaluate this simplified model on a set of 11
memory-intensive benchmarks from popular benchmark suites. Our solution
outperforms the state-of-the-art UVM framework, improving the performance by
10.89%, improving the device memory page hit rate by 16.98% (89.02% vs. 76.10%
for prior art), and reducing the CPU-GPU interconnect traffic by 11.05%.
According to our proposed unified metric, which combines the accuracy,
coverage, and page hit rate, our solution is approaching the ideal prefetching
scheme more than the state-of-the-art design (0.90 vs. 0.85, with the perfect
prefetcher of 1.0).

solve the emergency decision-making problem of emergent incidents, which
predicts the nodes where an incident may occur in the next time by GRU model
and makes decisions before the incident occurs, thus solving the problem that
the decision speed cannot keep up with the spreading speed. A simulation
environment was established for realistic scenarios, and three scenarios were
selected to test the performance of P-MADDPG in emergency decision-making
problems for emergent incidents: unmanned storage, factory assembly line, and
civil airport baggage transportation. Simulation results using the P-MADDPG
algorithm are compared with the greedy algorithm and the MADDPG algorithm, and
the final experimental results show that the P-MADDPG algorithm converges
faster and better than the other algorithms in scenarios of different sizes.
This shows that the P-MADDP algorithm is effective for emergency

high-speed Internet. However, optical fibers, serving as the data transmission
medium providing connectivity to billons of users worldwide, are prone to a
variety of anomalies resulting from hard failures (e.g., fiber cuts) and
malicious physical attacks (e.g., optical eavesdropping (fiber tapping)) etc.
Such anomalies may cause network disruption and thereby inducing huge financial
and data losses, or compromise the confidentiality of optical networks by
gaining unauthorized access to the carried data, or gradually degrade the
network operations. Therefore, it is highly required to implement efficient
anomaly detection, diagnosis, and localization schemes for enhancing the
availability and reliability of optical networks. In this paper, we propose a
data driven approach to accurately and quickly detect, diagnose, and localize

proposed method combines an autoencoder-based anomaly detection and an
attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit algorithm, whereby the
former is used for fault detection and the latter is adopted for fault
diagnosis and localization once an anomaly is detected by the autoencoder. We
verify the efficiency of our proposed approach by experiments under various
anomaly scenarios using real operational data. The experimental results
demonstrate that: (i) the autoencoder detects any fiber fault or anomaly with
an F1 score of 96.86%; and (ii) the attention-based bidirectional gated
