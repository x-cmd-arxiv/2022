human-written text perturbations in the wild and leverages them for realistic
adversarial attack. Unlike existing character-based attacks which often
deductively hypothesize a set of manipulation strategies, our work is grounded
on actual observations from real-world texts. We find that adversarial texts
generated by ANTHRO achieve the best trade-off between (1) attack success rate,
(2) semantic preservation of the original text, and (3) stealthiness--i.e.
indistinguishable from human writings hence harder to be flagged as suspicious.
Specifically, our attacks accomplished around 83% and 91% attack success rates
on BERT and RoBERTa, respectively. Moreover, it outperformed the TextBugger
baseline with an increase of 50% and 40% in terms of semantic preservation and
stealthiness when evaluated by both layperson and professional human workers.
ANTHRO can further enhance a BERT classifier's performance in understanding
different variations of human-written toxic texts via adversarial training when
compared to the Perspective API.

narrow plateau down to [Fe/H]~-2.8 dex, while at lower metallicities the
average value drops by 0.3 dex with a significant star-by-star scatter (called
lithium meltdown). This behaviour is in conflict with predictions of standard
stellar evolution models calculated with the initial A(Li) provided by the
standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The lower red giant branch (LRGB) stars
provide a complementary tool to understand the initial A(Li) distribution in
metal-poor stars. We have collected a sample of high-resolution spectra of 58
LRGB stars spanning a range of [Fe/H] between ~ -7.0 dex and ~ -1.3 dex. The
LRGB stars display an A(Li) distribution clearly different from that of the
dwarfs, without signatures of a meltdown and with two distinct components: (a)
a thin A(Li) plateau with an average A(Li)=1.09+-0.01 dex (sigma=0.07 dex), and
(b) a small fraction of Li-poor stars with A(Li) lower than ~0.7 dex. The A(Li)
distribution observed in LRGB stars can be reconciled with an initial abundance
close to the cosmological value, by including an additional chemical element
transport in stellar evolution models. The required efficiency of this
transport allows us to match also the Spite plateau lithium abundance measured
in the dwarfs. The emerging scenario is that all metal-poor stars formed with
the same initial A(Li) but those that are likely the product of coalescence or
that experienced binary mass transfer and show lower A(Li) . We conclude that
A(Li) in LRGB stars is qualitatively compatible with the cosmological A(Li)
value and that the meltdown observed in dwarf stars does not reflect a real
drop of the abundance at birth.

accurately, such efforts are time-consuming and more rapid prediction methods

to predict impurity transition levels using multi-fidelity datasets and a
machine learning approach employing features based on elemental properties and
impurity positions. We use transition levels obtained from low-fidelity (i.e.,
local-density approximation or generalized gradient approximation) density
functional theory (DFT) calculations, corrected using a recently proposed
modified band alignment scheme, which well-approximates transition levels from
high-fidelity DFT (i.e., hybrid HSE06). The model fit to the large
multi-fidelity database shows improved accuracy compared to the models trained
on the more limited high-fidelity values. Crucially, in our approach, when
using the multi-fidelity data, high-fidelity values are not required for model
training, significantly reducing the computational cost required for training
the model. Our machine learning model of transition levels has a root mean
squared (mean absolute) error of 0.36 (0.27) eV vs high-fidelity hybrid
functional values when averaged over 14 semiconductor systems from the II-VI

$1.41\pm 0.17\pm 0.10$. This result conflicts with the theoretical predictions
made by several groups. In our previous work, following the prescription given
in early literature where the $us$ diquark in $\Xi^{+}_{c}$ is assumed to be a
scalar whereas in $\Xi^{'+}_{c}$ is a vector i.e. the spin-flavor structure of
$\Xi^{+}_{c}$ is $[us]_0 c$ and that of $\Xi^{'+}_{c}$ is $[us]_1 c$, we
studied the case of $\Xi^{++}_{cc}\to\Xi^{(')+}$ with the light front quark
model. Numerically we obtained
$\Gamma(\Xi^{++}_{cc}\to\Xi^{'+}\pi^+)/\Gamma(\Xi^{++}_{cc}\to\Xi^{+}\pi^+)=0.56\pm0.18$
which is about half of the data. While abandoning the presupposition, we
suppose the spin-flavor structure of $us$ in $\Xi^{+}_{c}$ may be a mixture of
scalar and vector, namely the spin-flavor function of $\Xi^{+}_{c}$ could be
${\rm cos}\theta\, [us]_{0}[c]+{\rm sin}\theta\, [us]_{1}[c]$. An alternative
combination $-{\rm sin}\theta\,[us]_{0}[c]+{\rm cos}\theta\, [us]_{1}[c]$ would
correspond to $\Xi^{'+}_{c}$. Introducing the mixing mechanism the ratio
$\Gamma(\Xi^{++}_{cc}\to\Xi^{'+}\pi^+)/\Gamma(\Xi^{++}_{cc}\to\Xi^{+}\pi^+)$
depends on the mixing angle $\theta$. With the mixing scenario, the theoretical
prediction on the ratio between the transition rate of
$\Xi^{+}_{cc}\to\Xi^{'+}_c$ and that of $\Xi^{+}_{cc}\to\Xi^{+}_c$ can coincide
with the data as long as $\theta=16.27^\circ\pm2.30^\circ$ or
$85.54^\circ\pm2.30^\circ$ is set. Definitely, more precise measurements on
other decay portals of $\Xi^{+}_{cc}$ are badly needed for testing the mixing
mechanism and further determining the mixing angle.

a meta-learning approach: it learns how a recommender learns to generate the
optimal learning rates for future updates. Specifically, MeLON first enriches
the meaning of each interaction based on previous interactions and identifies
the role of each parameter for the interaction; and then combines these two

with state-of-the-art methods such as meta-GGA functionals and a spectral
weight approach to band unfolding from large supercells was used to obtain
dopant-related changes in the band structure, in particular the direct band gap
at the {\Gamma} point and indirect band gaps at the L(X) points of the BZ.
Analysis of contributions from geometry distortion and electronic interaction
was also performed. Moreover, the obtained results are discussed in the context
of obtaining a direct fundamental gap in Ge:B (B = C, Sn, and Pb) alloys, and
intermediate band formation in C:B (B = Sn and Pb) and Ge:C. An increase in
localization effects is also observed: a strong hole localization for alloys
diluted with a dopant of a larger covalent radius and a strong electron
localization for alloys with a dopant of smaller radius. Finally, it is shown
that alloying Si and Ge with other elements from group IV is a promising way to
enhance the functionality of group IV semiconductors.

infinite number of near zero minimizers, where only a small subset of those

the form $A(\phi)=1+\frac{\phi^2}{M^2}$ leads to an explicitly broken symmetry
with effective potential $V_{eff}(\phi)=-\mu^2 (1-\frac{\rho}{\mu^2 M^2})\phi^2
+\frac{\lambda}{2}\phi^4 + 2 \varepsilon \phi^3+\frac{\lambda}{2}\eta^4$. Due
to the explicit symmetry breaking induced by the cubic term we call this field
the 'asymmetron'. For large matter density $\rho>\rho_*\equiv
\mu^2M^2+\frac{9}{4}\varepsilon\eta M^2$ the effective potential has a single
minimum at $\phi=0$ leading to restoration of General Relativity as in the
usual symmetron screening mechanism. For low matter density however, there is a
false vacuum and a single true vacuum due to the explicit symmetry breaking.
This is expected to lead to an unstable network of domain walls with slightly
different value of the gravitational constant $G$ on each side of the wall.
This network would be in constant interaction with matter overdensities and
would lead to interesting observational signatures which could be detected as
gravitational and expansion rate transitions in redshift space. Such a
gravitational transition has been recently proposed for the resolution of the

parameter-efficient finetuning method for large-scale pretrained language
models. The method keeps the pretrained models fixed and only updates the
prefix token parameters for each downstream task. Despite being lightweight and
modular, prefix-tuning still lacks robustness to textual adversarial attacks.
However, most currently developed defense techniques necessitate auxiliary
model update and storage, which inevitably hamper the modularity and low
storage of prefix-tuning. In this work, we propose a robust prefix-tuning
framework that preserves the efficiency and modularity of prefix-tuning. The
core idea of our framework is leveraging the layerwise activations of the
language model by correctly-classified training data as the standard for
additional prefix finetuning. During the test phase, an extra batch-level
prefix is tuned for each batch and added to the original prefix for robustness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on three text classification benchmarks show
that our framework substantially improves robustness over several strong
baselines against five textual attacks of different types while maintaining
comparable accuracy on clean texts. We also interpret our robust prefix-tuning
framework from the optimal control perspective and pose several directions for
future research.

challenging, especially in confined spaces, such as shelves, where objects
cannot be accessed from above and they block reachability to each other. Such
constraints require many motion planning and collision checking calls, which
are computationally expensive. In addition, the arrangement space grows
exponentially with the number of objects. To address these issues, this work
introduces a lazy evaluation framework with a local monotone solver and a
global planner. Monotone instances are those that can be solved by moving each
object at most once. A key insight is that reachability constraints at the
grasps for objects' starts and goals can quickly reveal dependencies between
objects without having to execute expensive motion planning queries. Given
that, the local solver builds lazily a search tree that respects these
reachability constraints without verifying that the arm paths are collision
free. It only collision checks when a promising solution is found. If a
monotone solution is not found, the non-monotone planner loads the lazy search
tree and explores ways to move objects to intermediate locations from where
monotone solutions to the goal can be found. Results show that the proposed
framework can solve difficult instances in confined spaces with up to 16
objects, which state-of-the-art methods fail to solve. It also solves problems
faster than alternatives, when the alternatives find a solution. It also
achieves high-quality solutions, i.e., only 1.8 additional actions on average
are needed for non-monotone instances.

through non-local network connections. Inspired by the Watts-Strogatz
small-world model, we employ a single parameter to determine the probability of
local connections being re-wired, and to induce transitions between regular and
disordered lattices. These connections are added as non-local springs to
underlying periodic one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) square,
triangular and hexagonal lattices. Eigenmode computations illustrate the
emergence of spectral gaps in various representative lattices for increasing
degrees of disorder. These gaps manifest themselves as frequency ranges where
the modal density goes to zero, or that are populated only by localized modes.
In both cases, we observe low transmission levels of vibrations across the
lattice. Overall, we find that these gaps are more pronounced for lattice
topologies with lower connectivity, such as the 1D lattice or the 2D hexagonal
lattice. We then illustrate that the disordered lattices undergo transitions
from ballistic to super-diffusive or diffusive transport for increasing levels
of disorder. These properties, illustrated through numerical simulations,
unveil the potential for disorder in the form of non-local connections to
enable additional functionalities for metamaterials. These include the
occurrence of disorder-induced spectral gaps, which is relevant to frequency
filtering devices, as well as the possibility to induce diffusive-type
transport which does not occur in regular periodic materials, and that may find
applications in dynamic stress mitigation.

understanding the values of the end-users of apps is the essential first step
towards values-based apps development. This research aims to fill this gap by
investigating the human values of Bangladeshi female farmers as a marginalized

an empirical study that collected and analyzed data from a survey with 193

values of Bangladeshi female farmers and the significance of demographics on
their values. The results identified three underlying factors of Bangladeshi
female farmers. The first factor comprises of five values: benevolence,

of two values: self-direction and stimulation. The third factor includes three
values: power, achievement, and hedonism. We also identified strong influences
of demographics on some of the values of Bangladeshi female farmers. For
example, area has significant impacts on three values: hedonism, achievement,

although data quality has been an object of research for decades, there is a
clear lack of research on potential data quality issues (e.g., ambiguous,
extraneous values). These kinds of issues are latent in nature and thus often
not obvious. Nevertheless, they can be associated with an increased risk of
future problems in AI-based systems (e.g., technical debt, data-induced
faults). As a counterpart to code smells in software engineering, we refer to
such issues as Data Smells. This article conceptualizes data smells and
elaborates on their causes, consequences, detection, and use in the context of
AI-based systems. In addition, a catalogue of 36 data smells divided into three
categories (i.e., Believability Smells, Understandability Smells, Consistency
Smells) is presented. Moreover, the article outlines tool support for detecting
data smells and presents the result of an initial smell detection on more than
240 real-world datasets.

hands. While hand pressure can be measured by placing pressure sensors between
the hand and the environment, doing so can alter contact mechanics, interfere
with human tactile perception, require costly sensors, and scale poorly to
large environments. We explore the possibility of using a conventional RGB
camera to infer hand pressure, enabling machine perception of hand pressure
from uninstrumented hands and surfaces. The central insight is that the
application of pressure by a hand results in informative appearance changes.
Hands share biomechanical properties that result in similar observable
phenomena, such as soft-tissue deformation, blood distribution, hand pose, and
cast shadows. We collected videos of 36 participants with diverse skin tone
applying pressure to an instrumented planar surface. We then trained a deep
model (PressureVisionNet) to infer a pressure image from a single RGB image.
Our model infers pressure for participants outside of the training data and
outperforms baselines. We also show that the output of our model depends on the
appearance of the hand and cast shadows near contact regions. Overall, our
results suggest the appearance of a previously unobserved human hand can be
used to accurately infer applied pressure. Data, code, and models are available
online.

least squares (LS) does, Rousseeuw (1984) proposed to minimize the sum of $h$

called least trimmed squares (LTS). The idea of the LTS is simple but its
computation is challenging since no LS-type analytical computation formula
exists anymore. Attempts had been made since its presence, the feasible
solution algorithm (Hawkins (1994)), fastlts.f (Rousseeuw and Van Driessen

promising approximate algorithms. The latter two have been incorporated into R

subsampling- approaches. With the great software accessibility and fast speed,
the LTS, enjoying many desired properties, has become one of the most popular
robust regression estimators across multiple disciplines. This article proposes
analytic approaches -- employing first-order derivative (gradient) and
second-order derivative (Hessian matrix) of the objective function. Our
approximate algorithms for the LTS are vetted in synthetic and real data
examples. Compared with ltsReg -- the benchmark in robust regression and
well-known for its speed, our algorithms are comparable (and sometimes even
favorable) with respect to both speed and accuracy criteria. Other major
contributions include (i) originating the uniqueness and the strong and Fisher
consistency at empirical and population settings respectively; (ii) deriving
the influence function in a general setting; (iii) re-establishing the
asymptotic normality (consequently root-n consistency) of the estimator with a
neat and general approach.

highly enriched in the jet drops ejected during bubble bursting, impacting
global climate and public health. However, the detailed mechanism of this
enrichment remains obscure, with the enrichment factor being difficult to

wireless solutions employed in industrial fields either cannot support the
desired high-speed communications or cannot guarantee deterministic, real-time
performance. A more recent wireless technology, RT-WiFi, achieves a good
balance between high-speed data rates and deterministic communication
performance. It is however developed on commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS)
hardware, and takes considerable effort and hardware expertise to maintain and
upgrade. To address these problems, this paper introduces the software-defined
radio (SDR)-based RT-WiFi solution which we call SRT-WiFi. SRT-WiFi provides
full-stack configurability for high-speed real-time wireless communications. We
present the overall system architecture of SRT-WiFi and discuss its key
functions which achieve better timing performance and solve the queue
management and rate adaptation issues compared to COTS hardware-based RT-WiFi.
To achieve effective network management with rate adaptation in multi-cluster
SRT-WiFi, a novel scheduling problem is formulated and an effective algorithm
is proposed to solve the problem. A multi-cluster SRT-WiFi testbed is developed
to validate the design, and extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the
performance at both device and system levels.

world like a human and react accordingly. Semantic segmentation of normal
scenes has experienced a remarkable rise in accuracy on conventional
benchmarks. However, a significant portion of real-life accidents features
abnormal scenes, such as those with object deformations, overturns, and
unexpected traffic behaviors. Since even small mis-segmentation of driving
scenes can lead to serious threats to human lives, the robustness of such
models in accident scenarios is an extremely important factor in ensuring
safety of intelligent transportation systems.
  In this paper, we propose a Multi-source Meta-learning Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation (MMUDA) framework, to improve the generalization of segmentation
transformers to extreme accident scenes. In MMUDA, we make use of Multi-Domain
Mixed Sampling to augment the images of multiple-source domains (normal scenes)
with the target data appearances (abnormal scenes). To train our model, we
intertwine and study a meta-learning strategy in the multi-source setting for
robustifying the segmentation results. We further enhance the segmentation
backbone (SegFormer) with a HybridASPP decoder design, featuring large window
attention spatial pyramid pooling and strip pooling, to efficiently aggregate
long-range contextual dependencies. Our approach achieves a mIoU score of
46.97% on the DADA-seg benchmark, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art
model by more than 7.50%. Code will be made publicly available at

class of finite graphs we are guaranteed to have a clique or anti-clique of

provided by Ramsey's Theorem in general. On the other hand, in uncountable
cardinalities, the model-theoretic property of stability guarantees a uniform
set much larger than the bound provided by the Erd\H{o}s-Rado Theorem in
general.
  Even though the consequences of stability in the finite have been much
studied in the literature, the countable setting seems a priori quite
different, namely, in the countably infinite the notion of largeness based on
cardinality alone does not reveal any structure as Ramsey's Theorem already
provides a countably infinite uniform set in general. In this paper, we show
that the natural notion of largeness given by upper density reveals that these
phenomena meet in the countable: a countable graph has an almost clique or
anti-clique of positive upper density if and only if it has a positive upper
density almost stable set. Moreover, this result also extends naturally to
countable models of a universal theory in a finite relational language.
  Our methods explore a connection with the notion of convergence in the theory
of limits of dense combinatorial objects, introducing and studying a natural
approximate version of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property that allows for a
negligible error in the edges (in general, predicates) but requires
linear-sized uniform sets in convergent sequences of models (this is much
stronger than what stable regularity can provide as the error is required to go
to zero). Finally, surprisingly, we completely characterize all hereditary
classes of finite graphs that have this approximate Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property.
The proof highlights both differences and similarities with the original
conjecture.

resonance positions (and thus the Stark shifts), while the imaginary parts
$-\Gamma/2$ are related to the decay rates $\Gamma$, i.e., the full-widths at

for forces directed in the three Cartesian co-ordinates, the fastest ionizing
orbital always displays a non-monotonic Stark shift. For the case of fields
along the molecular axis we also compare results as a function of the number of

participants were aware of linkage blindness or vulnerability chaining, as well

radiation emitted by random lasers and random fiber lasers. The multimode
character of these systems, with a relevant degree of disorder in the active
medium, and large number of random scattering centers substantially hinder the
calculation of $g^{(2)}(t)$. Here we apply for the first time in a photonic
system the universal statistical properties of Ginibre's non-Hermitian random

to address the statistical properties of general disordered photonic systems
with various Hamiltonian symmetries.

Interstellar scintillation (ISS) of pulsar emission can be used both
as a probe of the ionised interstellar medium (IISM) and cause corruptions in
pulsar timing experiments. Of particular interest are so-called scintillation
arcs which can be used to measure time-variable interstellar scattering delays
directly, potentially allowing high-precision improvements to timing precision.
  Aims. The primary aim of this study is to carry out the first sizeable and
self-consistent census of diffractive pulsar scintillation and
scintillation-arc detectability at low frequencies, as a primer for
larger-scale IISM studies and pulsar-timing related propagation studies with
the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) High Band Antennae (HBA).
  Results. In this initial set of 31 sources, 15 allow full determination of
the scintillation properties; nine of these show detectable scintillation arcs
at 120-180 MHz. Eight of the observed sources show unresolved scintillation;
and the final eight don't display diffractive scintillation. Some correlation
between scintillation detectability and pulsar brightness and dispersion
measure is apparent, although no clear cut-off values can be determined. Our
measurements across a large fractional bandwidth allow a meaningful test of the
frequency scaling of scintillation parameters, uncorrupted by influences from
refractive scintillation variations.
  Conclusions. Our results indicate the powerful advantage and great potential
of ISS studies at low frequencies and the complex dependence of scintillation
detectability on parameters like pulsar brightness and interstellar dispersion.
This work provides the first installment of a larger-scale census and
longer-term monitoring of interstellar scintillation effects at low
frequencies.

underpinned by a simulated environment that allows for a comprehensive

with historical field data is undoubtedly important, such an assessment has
limited statistical power because it corresponds to only one realization. The
proposed methodology enables validation over a large number of realizations,
thereby circumventing the statistical limitations of evaluation on historical

distinguish between the variability in the observed data and differences in
performance between safety approaches. A simulated environment does this by
comparing the approaches under controlled circumstances, resulting in a fair
and systematic evaluation of the potential long-term benefits. We demonstrate
the utility of the proposed methodology via a case study that compares a few
candidate safety analytics approaches. These approaches differ in how they
assimilate field safety data to assess safety risk and suggest mitigative
actions. We show that the proposed methodology indeed reveals useful insights

Furthermore, the generated attention maps explained the attribute encoding in

analyzed healthy and myocardial infarction patients with clinical, cardiac

  Environmental Sound","Accepted in EUSIPCO 2022",,,,"cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Audio applications involving environmental sound analysis increasingly use
general-purpose audio representations, also known as embeddings, for transfer
learning. Recently, Holistic Evaluation of Audio Representations (HEAR)
evaluated twenty-nine embedding models on nineteen diverse tasks. However, the
evaluation's effectiveness depends on the variation already captured within a
given dataset. Therefore, for a given data domain, it is unclear how the
representations would be affected by the variations caused by myriad
microphones' range and acoustic conditions -- commonly known as channel
effects. We aim to extend HEAR to evaluate invariance to channel effects in
this work. To accomplish this, we imitate channel effects by injecting
perturbations to the audio signal and measure the shift in the new (perturbed)
embeddings with three distance measures, making the evaluation domain-dependent
but not task-dependent. Combined with the downstream performance, it helps us
make a more informed prediction of how robust the embeddings are to the channel
effects. We evaluate two embeddings -- YAMNet, and OpenL3 on monophonic
(UrbanSound8K) and polyphonic (SONYC-UST) urban datasets. We show that one
distance measure does not suffice in such task-independent evaluation. Although
Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) correlates with the trend of the performance
drop in the downstream task most accurately, we show that we need to study FAD
in conjunction with the other distances to get a clear understanding of the
overall effect of the perturbation. In terms of the embedding performance, we
find OpenL3 to be more robust than YAMNet, which aligns with the HEAR
evaluation.

  with Pipelined Feature Communication","ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is the state-of-the-art method for
learning graph-structured data, and training large-scale GCNs requires
distributed training across multiple accelerators such that each accelerator is
able to hold a partitioned subgraph. However, distributed GCN training incurs
prohibitive overhead of communicating node features and feature gradients among
partitions for every GCN layer during each training iteration, limiting the
achievable training efficiency and model scalability. To this end, we propose
PipeGCN, a simple yet effective scheme that hides the communication overhead by
pipelining inter-partition communication with intra-partition computation. It
is non-trivial to pipeline for efficient GCN training, as communicated node
features/gradients will become stale and thus can harm the convergence,
negating the pipeline benefit. Notably, little is known regarding the
convergence rate of GCN training with both stale features and stale feature
gradients. This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but
also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla
distributed GCN training without any staleness. Furthermore, we develop a
smoothing method to further improve PipeGCN's convergence. Extensive
experiments show that PipeGCN can largely boost the training throughput
(1.7x~28.5x) while achieving the same accuracy as its vanilla counterpart and
existing full-graph training methods. The code is available at

problem using pre-trained language models, restricted output, and extra

its POS tagging. Rather than using the hard mask as in previous works, our
experiments show that learning a soft-weighting function for the candidate
phonemes benefits performance. In addition, our proposed g2pW does not require
extra pre-trained POS tagging models while using POS tags as auxiliary features
since we train the POS tagging model simultaneously with the unified encoder.
Experimental results show that our g2pW outperforms existing methods on the
public CPP dataset. All codes, model weights, and a user-friendly package are

radiation loads as well as particle backgrounds in the detector. The SC magnets
and detector protection considerations impose strict limitations on the lattice
choice, hence the design of the collider optics, magnets and Machine Detector
Interface (MDI) are closely intertwined. As a first approximation we use the
Interaction Region (IR) design with beta-star=3 mm, whereas for the arcs we
re-scale the arc cell design of the 3 TeV MC. Traditional cos-theta coil
geometry and Nb3Sn superconductor were used to provide field maps for the
analysis and optimization of the arc lattice and IR design, as well as for
studies of beam dynamics and magnet protection against radiation. The stress
management in the coil will be needed to avoid large degradation or even damage
of the brittle SC coils. In the assumed IR designs, the dipoles close to the
Interaction Point (IP) and tungsten masks in each IR (to protect magnets) help
reducing background particle fluxes in the detector by a substantial factor.
The tungsten nozzles in the 6 to 600 cm region from the IP, assisted by the
detector solenoid field, trap most of the decay electrons created close to the
IP as well as most of the incoherent electron-positron pairs generated in the
IP. With sophisticated tungsten, iron, concrete and borated polyethylene
shielding in the MDI region, the total reduction of background loads by more
than three orders of magnitude can be achieved.

Human-Gaze-Target (HGT) detection, i.e., gaze following. Current approaches
decouple the HGT detection task into separate branches of salient object
detection and human gaze prediction, employing a two-stage framework where
human head locations must first be detected and then be fed into the next gaze
target prediction sub-network. In contrast, we redefine the HGT detection task
as detecting human head locations and their gaze targets, simultaneously. By
this way, our method, named Human-Gaze-Target detection TRansformer or HGTTR,
streamlines the HGT detection pipeline by eliminating all other additional
components. HGTTR reasons about the relations of salient objects and human gaze
from the global image context. Moreover, unlike existing two-stage methods that
require human head locations as input and can predict only one human's gaze
target at a time, HGTTR can directly predict the locations of all people and
their gaze targets at one time in an end-to-end manner. The effectiveness and
robustness of our proposed method are verified with extensive experiments on
the two standard benchmark datasets, GazeFollowing and VideoAttentionTarget.
Without bells and whistles, HGTTR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods

VideoAttentionTarget) with a much simpler architecture.

dynamic attention and global context, but also needs to introduce features
concerning noise reduction, shifting, and scaling invariance of objects.
Therefore, here we take a step forward to study the structural characteristics
of Transformer and convolution and propose an architecture search method-Vision
Transformer with Convolutions Architecture Search (VTCAS). The high-performance
backbone network searched by VTCAS introduces the desirable features of
convolutional neural networks into the Transformer architecture while
maintaining the benefits of the multi-head attention mechanism. The searched
block-based backbone network can extract feature maps at different scales.
These features are compatible with a wider range of visual tasks, such as image
classification (32 M parameters, 82.0% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and
object detection (50.4% mAP on COCO2017). The proposed topology based on the
multi-head attention mechanism and CNN adaptively associates relational
features of pixels with multi-scale features of objects. It enhances the
robustness of the neural network for object recognition, especially in the low

(RWD) is only consistently available in free-text clinical documents. Manual
curation is expensive and time-consuming. Developing natural language
processing (NLP) methods for structuring RWD is thus essential for scaling
real-world evidence generation.
  Materials and Methods: Traditional rule-based systems are vulnerable to the
prevalent linguistic variations and ambiguities in clinical text, and prior
applications of machine-learning methods typically require sentence-level or
report-level labeled examples that are hard to produce at scale. We propose
leveraging patient-level supervision from medical registries, which are often
readily available and capture key patient information, for general RWD
applications. To combat the lack of sentence-level or report-level annotations,
we explore advanced deep-learning methods by combining domain-specific
pretraining, recurrent neural networks, and hierarchical attention.
  Results: We conduct an extensive study on 135,107 patients from the cancer
registry of a large integrated delivery network (IDN) comprising healthcare
systems in five western US states. Our deep learning methods attain test AUROC
of 94-99% for key tumor attributes and comparable performance on held-out data
from separate health systems and states.
  Discussion and Conclusion: Ablation results demonstrate clear superiority of
these advanced deep-learning methods over prior approaches. Error analysis
shows that our NLP system sometimes even corrects errors in registrar labels.
We also conduct a preliminary investigation in accelerating registry curation
and general RWD structuring via assisted curation for over 1.2 million cancer

from industry and academia. Especially, among various QC research topics,
variational quantum circuit (VQC) enables quantum deep reinforcement learning

multi-agent RL (QMARL). However, the extension of QRL to QMARL is not
straightforward due to the challenge of the noise intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) and the non-stationary properties in classical multi-agent RL (MARL).
Therefore, this paper proposes the centralized training and decentralized

cope with these issues. To corroborate the QMARL framework, this paper conducts
the QMARL demonstration in a single-hop environment where edge agents offload

method is to replace the original Bellman Optimal operator in AL with a smooth
one so as to obtain more reliable estimation of the temporal difference target.
We give a detailed account of the resulting action gap and the performance
bound for approximate SAL. Further theoretical analysis reveals that the
proposed value smoothing technique not only helps to stabilize the training
procedure of AL by controlling the trade-off between convergence rate and the
upper bound of the approximation errors, but is beneficial to increase the
action gap between the optimal and sub-optimal action value as well.

the great success of deep generative models in drug design, the existing
methods are mostly string-based or graph-based. They are limited by the lack of
spatial information and thus unable to be applied to structure-based design
tasks. Particularly, such models have no or little knowledge of how molecules
interact with their target proteins exactly in 3D space. In this paper, we
propose a 3D generative model that generates molecules given a designated 3D
protein binding site. Specifically, given a binding site as the 3D context, our
model estimates the probability density of atom's occurrences in 3D space --
positions that are more likely to have atoms will be assigned higher
probability. To generate 3D molecules, we propose an auto-regressive sampling
scheme -- atoms are sampled sequentially from the learned distribution until
there is no room for new atoms. Combined with this sampling scheme, our model
can generate valid and diverse molecules, which could be applicable to various
structure-based molecular design tasks such as molecule sampling and linker
design. Experimental results demonstrate that molecules sampled from our model
exhibit high binding affinity to specific targets and good drug properties such
as drug-likeness even if the model is not explicitly optimized for them.

having the ability for the models to extrapolate outside the convex hull of
training set. We specifically, consider classification models, e.g., image
classification and other applications of deep learning. Such models are
classification functions that partition their domain and assign a class to each
partition \cite{strang2019linear}. Partitions are defined by decision
boundaries and so is the classification model/function. Convex hull of training
set may occupy only a subset of the domain, but trained model may partition the
entire domain and not just the convex hull of training set. This is important
because many of the testing samples may be outside the convex hull of training
set and the way in which a model partitions its domain outside the convex hull
would be influential in its generalization. Using approximation theory, we
prove that over-parameterization is a necessary condition for having control
over the partitioning of the domain outside the convex hull of training set. We
also propose a more clear definition for the notion of over-parametrization
based on the learning task and the training set at hand. We present empirical
evidence about geometry of datasets, both image and non-image, to provide
insights about the extent of extrapolation performed by the models. We consider
a 64-dimensional feature space learned by a ResNet model and investigate the
geometric arrangements of convex hulls and decision boundaries in that space.
We also formalize the notion of extrapolation and relate it to the scope of the
model. Finally, we review the rich extrapolation literature in pure and applied
mathematics, e.g., the Whitney's Extension Problem, and place our theory in
that context.

In this paper, we present a novel optimal transport-based fine-tuning framework

fine-Tuning, for GNN style backbones. GTOT-Tuning is required to utilize the
property of graph data to enhance the preservation of representation produced

transfer as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem with a structural prior and
construct the GTOT regularizer to constrain the fine-tuned model behaviors. By
using the adjacency relationship amongst nodes, the GTOT regularizer achieves
node-level optimal transport procedures and reduces redundant transport
procedures, resulting in efficient knowledge transfer from the pre-trained

both common and unique features of the anchor and positive samples in
contrastive learning. The partitioned representation consists of two parts: the
content part and the style part. The content part represents common features of
the class, and the style part represents the own features of each sample, which
can lead to the representation of the data augmentation method. We can achieve
the partitioned representation simply by decomposing a loss function of
contrastive learning into two terms on the two separate representations,
respectively. To evaluate our representation with two parts, we take two
framework models: Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and BootstrapYour Own
Latent(BYOL) to show the separability of content and style, and to confirm the
generalization ability in classification, respectively. Based on the

processing (NLP) and achieves great success. Most transfer learning systems are
based on the same modality (e.g. RGB image in CV and text in NLP). However, the
cross-modality transfer learning (CMTL) systems are scarce. In this work, we
study CMTL from 2D to 3D sensor to explore the upper bound performance of 3D
sensor only systems, which play critical roles in robotic navigation and
perform well in low light scenarios. While most CMTL pipelines from 2D to 3D
vision are complicated and based on Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets),
ours is easy to implement, expand and based on both ConvNets and Vision
transformers(ViTs): 1) By converting point clouds to pseudo-images, we can use
an almost identical network from pre-trained models based on 2D images. This
makes our system easy to implement and expand. 2) Recently ViTs have been
showing good performance and robustness to occlusions, one of the key reasons
for poor performance of 3D vision systems. We explored both ViT and ConvNet
with similar model sizes to investigate the performance difference. We name our
approach simCrossTrans: simple cross-modality transfer learning with ConvNets
or ViTs. Experiments on SUN RGB-D dataset show: with simCrossTrans we achieve
$13.2\%$ and $16.1\%$ absolute performance gain based on ConvNets and ViTs
separately. We also observed the ViTs based performs $9.7\%$ better than the
ConvNets one, showing the power of simCrossTrans with ViT. simCrossTrans with
ViTs surpasses the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin of
$+15.4\%$ mAP50. Compared with the previous 2D detection SOTA based RGB images,
our depth image only system only has a $1\%$ gap. The code, training/inference

The quantum correlations of a two-qubit system are first studied in different
bosonic reservoirs. Both equilibrium and nonequilibrium scenarios are
discussed. Non-Markovian effects can improve the survival time of the quantum
correlations significantly and weaken the decoherence effect. Non-Markovian
dynamics with existing memory can lead to entanglement rebirth in specific
scenarios instead of the eventual entanglement decay or death seen in
memoryless Markovian cases. The system reaches a steady state quickest in
sub-Ohmic reservoirs and shows the most apparent non-Markovian behavior in
super-Ohmic reservoirs. We not only study the impact of the environment on
quantum correlations but also how to protect quantum correlations. Starting
from a state in which the two ends are maximally entangled, a one-dimensional
AA chain model is also studied. We identify distinct phases by monitoring the
imbalance dynamics. When the chain is closed, the imbalance dynamics behave
differently in various phases, and so does the entanglement evolution between
the chain's ends. When the first site couples to a bath, we found the imbalance
dynamics can still be an effective indicator to differentiate various phases in
an early evolution stage since the imbalance dynamics is only remarkably
affected at relatively high temperatures. The distribution of the eigenenergy
of the system can account for it. The entanglement of the chain ends decays
rapidly in all phases due to one of the ends being coupled to the bath
directly. However, the entanglement of the chain ends will persist for a
perceptible amount of time in the localization phase if the bath is coupled to
the middle site of the chain. Our research shows that one can utilize the
disordered environment as a buffer to protect quantum correlations.

based on interferometers with short baselines is expected to alleviate some of
the difficulties associated with a single element approach such as precision
modelling of the receiver noise spectrum. Short spacing Interferometer
Telescope probing cosmic dAwn and epoch of ReionisAtion (SITARA) is a short
spacing interferometer deployed at the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory
(MRO). It is intended to be a prototype or a test-bed to gain a better
understanding of interferometry at short baselines, and develop tools to
perform observations and data calibration. In this paper, we provide a
description of the SITARA system and its deployment at the MRO, and discuss
strategies developed to calibrate SITARA. We touch upon certain systematics
seen in SITARA data and their modelling. We find that SITARA has sensitivity to
all sky signals as well as non-negligible noise coupling between the antennas.
It is seen that the coupled receiver noise has a spectral shape that broadly
matches the theoretical calculations reported in prior works. We also find that
when appropriately modified antenna radiation patterns taking into account the
effects of mutual coupling are used, the measured data are well modelled by the
standard visibility equation.

unit affects others, i.e., interference exists. In the presence of
interference, we cannot perform a classical randomization test directly because
a null hypothesis is not sharp. Instead, we need to perform the randomization
test restricted to a subset of units and assignments that makes the null
hypothesis sharp. A previous study constructed a useful testing method, a
biclique test, by reducing the selection of the appropriate subsets to
searching for bicliques in a bipartite graph. However, since the power depends
on the features of selected subsets, there is still room to improve the power
by refining the selection procedure. In this paper, we propose a method to
improve the biclique test based on a power evaluation of the randomization
test. We explicitly derived an expression for the power of the randomization
test under several assumptions and found that a certain quantity calculated
from a given assignment set characterizes the power. Based on this fact, we
propose a method to improve the power of the biclique test by modifying the
selection rule for subsets of units and assignments. Through a simulation with
a spatial interference setting, we confirm that the proposed method has higher

paleoclimate states to enable a better interpretation of the NPLD physical and
chemical stratigraphy. When a tropical ice reservoir is present, water vapor
transport from the tropics to the poles at low obliquity is modulated by the
intensity of summer. At times of low and relatively constant obliquity, the
flux still varies due to other orbital elements, promoting polar layer
formation. Ice migrates from the tropics towards the poles in two stages.
First, when surface ice is present in the tropics, and second, when the
equatorial deposit is exhausted, from ice that was previously deposited in
mid-high latitudes. The polar accumulation rate is significantly higher when
tropical ice is available, forming thicker layers per orbital cycle. However,
the majority of the NPLD is sourced from ice that temporary resided in the
mid-high latitudes and the layers become thinner as the source location moves
poleward. The migration stages imprint different D/H ratios in different
sections in the PLDs. The NPLD is isotopically depleted compared to the SPLD in

datasets by integrating multiple visualizations in a meaningful and aesthetic
layout, such as juxtaposition, overlay, and nesting. With this strategy,
numerous novel designs have been proposed in visualization publications to
accomplish various visual analytic tasks. These well-crafted composite
visualizations have formed a valuable collection for designers and researchers
to address real-world problems and inspire new research topics and designs.
However, there is a lack of understanding of design patterns of composite
visualization, thus failing to provide holistic design space and concrete
examples for practical use. In this paper, we opted to revisit the composite
visualizations in VIS publications and answered what and how visualizations of
different types are composed together. To achieve this, we first constructed a
corpus of composite visualizations from IEEE VIS publications and decomposed
them into a series of basic visualization types (e.g., bar chart, map, and
matrix). With this corpus, we studied the spatial (e.g., separated or
overlaying) and semantic relationships (e.g., with same types or shared axis)
between visualizations and proposed a taxonomy consisting of eight different
design patterns (e.g., repeated, stacked, accompanied, and nested).
Furthermore, we analyzed and discussed common practices of composite
visualizations, such as the distribution of different patterns and correlations
between visualization types. From the analysis and examples, we obtained
insights into different design patterns on the utilities, advantages, and
disadvantages. Finally, we developed an interactive system to help
visualization developers and researchers conveniently explore collected
examples and design patterns.

boundary value between neighbouring sub-domains, which provides a more
efficient way than the other Schwarz algorithms to realize distributed
computation. However, the convergence speed of the traditional SWR is slow, and
various optimization strategies have been brought in to accelerate the
convergence. In this paper, we propose a non-iterative overlapping variant of
SWR for wave equation, which is named Relative Schwarz Waveform Relaxation
algorithm (RSWR). RSWR is inspired by the physical observation that the
velocity of wave is limited, based on the Theory of Relativity. The change of
value at one space point will take time span $\Delta t$ to transmit to another
space point and vice versa. This $\Delta t$ could be utilized to design
distributed numerical algorithm, as we have done in RSWR. During each time
span, RSWR needs only 3 steps to achieve high accurate waveform, by using the
predict-select-update strategy. The key for this strategy is to find the
maximum time span for the waveform. The validation of RSWR could be proved
straightfowardly. Numerical experiments show that RSWR is accurate, and is
potential to be scalable and fast.

evolution of the Main Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the
widest range of redshift ($0 < z < 6$) and stellar mass ($10^{8.5}-10^{11.5}$
$M_{\odot}$) ever probed. We convert all observations to a common calibration
and find a remarkable consensus on the variation of the MS shape and
normalization across cosmic time. The relation exhibits a curvature towards the
high stellar masses at all redshifts. The best functional form is governed by
two parameters: the evolution of the normalization and the turnover mass
($M_0(t)$), which both evolve as a power law of the Universe age. The turn-over
mass determines the MS shape. It marginally evolves with time, making the MS
slightly steeper towards $z\sim4-6$. At stellar masses below $M_0(t)$, SFGs
have a constant specific SFR (sSFR), while above $M_0(t)$ the sSFR is
suppressed. We find that the MS is dominated by central galaxies. This allows
to turn $M_0(t)$ into the corresponding host halo mass. This evolves as the
halo mass threshold between cold and hot accretion regimes, as predicted by the
theory of accretion, where the central galaxy is fed or starved of cold gas
supply, respectively. We, thus, argue that the progressive MS bending as a
function of the Universe age is caused by the lower availability of cold gas in
halos entering the hot accretion phase, in addition to black hole feedback. We
also find qualitatively the same trend in the largest sample of star-forming
galaxies provided by the IllustrisTNG simulation. Nevertheless, we still note
large quantitative discrepancies with respect to observations, in particular at
the high mass end. These can not be easily ascribed to biases or systematics in
the observed SFRs and the derived MS.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present NeuralReshaper, a novel method for semantic
reshaping of human bodies in single images using deep generative networks. To
achieve globally coherent reshaping effects, our approach follows a
fit-then-reshape pipeline, which first fits a parametric 3D human model to a
source human image and then reshapes the fitted 3D model with respect to
user-specified semantic attributes. Previous methods rely on image warping to
transfer 3D reshaping effects to the entire image domain and thus often cause
distortions in both foreground and background. In contrast, we resort to
generative adversarial nets conditioned on the source image and a 2D warping
field induced by the reshaped 3D model, to achieve more realistic reshaping
results. Specifically, we separately encode the foreground and background
information in the source image using a two-headed UNet-like generator, and
guide the information flow from the foreground branch to the background branch
via feature space warping. Furthermore, to deal with the lack-of-data problem
that no paired data exist (i.e., the same human bodies in varying shapes), we
introduce a novel self-supervised strategy to train our network. Unlike
previous methods that often require manual efforts to correct undesirable
artifacts caused by incorrect body-to-image fitting, our method is fully
automatic. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches.

finding design conditions for repetitive systems to achieve the perfect
tracking of any specified trajectory, whereas they ignore a fundamental problem
of ILC: whether the specified trajectory is trackable, or equivalently, whether
there exist some inputs for the repetitive systems under consideration to
generate the specified trajectory? The current paper contributes to dealing
with this problem. Not only is a concept of trackability introduced formally
for any specified trajectory in ILC, but also some related trackability
criteria are established. Further, the relation between the trackability and
the perfect tracking tasks for ILC is bridged, based on which a new convergence
analysis approach is developed for ILC by leveraging properties of a functional
Cauchy sequence (FCS). Simulation examples are given to verify the
effectiveness of the presented trackability criteria and FCS-induced

traditional choice data, unless we impose the practically restrictive and
conceptually awkward assumption that utilities are state-independent. In this
paper, we propose a novel methodology that solves this long-standing
identification problem in a simple way, using a variant of the strategy method.
Our method relies on the concept of a suitable proxy. The crucial property is
that the agent does not have any stakes in the proxy conditional on the
realization of the original state space. Then, instead of trying to identify
directly the agent's beliefs about the state space, we elicit her conditional
beliefs about the proxy given each state realization. The latter can be easily
done with existing elicitation tools and without worrying about the
identification problem. It turns out that this is enough to uniquely identify
the agent's beliefs. We present different classes of proxies that one can
reasonably use, and we show that it is almost always possible to find one which
is easy to implement. Such flexibility makes our method, not only
theoretically-sound, but also empirically appealing. We also show how our new
method allows us to provide a novel well-founded definition of a utility
function over states. Last but not least, it also allows us to cleanly identify
motivated beliefs, freed from confounding distortions caused by the

seasonal variations of stellar irradiation at local latitudes. The extent of
the atmospheric response can be crudely estimated by the ratio between the
orbital timescale and the atmospheric radiative timescale. Given a set of
atmospheric parameters, we show that this ratio depends mostly on the stellar
properties and is independent of orbital distance and planetary equilibrium
temperature. For Jupiter-like atmospheres, this ratio is $\ll1$ for planets
around very-low-mass M dwarfs and $\gtrsim1$ when the stellar mass is greater
than about 0.6 solar mass. Complications can arise from various factors,
including varying atmospheric metallicity, clouds, and atmospheric dynamics.
Given the eccentricity and obliquity, the seasonal response is expected to be
systematically weaker for gaseous exoplanets around low-mass stars and stronger
for those around more massive stars. The amplitude and phase lag of atmospheric
seasonal variations as a function of host stellar mass are quantified by
idealized analytic models. At the infrared emission level in the photosphere,
the relative amplitudes of thermal flux and temperature perturbations are
negligible, and their phase lags are closed to $-90^{\circ}$ for Jupiter-like
planets around very-low-mass stars. The relative amplitudes and phase lags
increase gradually with increasing stellar mass. With a particular stellar
mass, the relative amplitude and phase lag decrease from low to high infrared
optical depth. We also present numerical calculations for a better illustration
of the seasonal behaviors. Lastly, we discuss implications for the atmospheric
circulation and future atmospheric characterization of exoplanets in systems

structure design with optimum performance of interest. However, the process
requires numerical evaluation of objective function and constraints at each
iteration, which is computational expensive especially for large-scale design.
Deep learning-based models have been developed to accelerate the process either
by acting as surrogate models replacing the simulation process, or completely
replacing the optimization process. However, most of them require a large set
of labelled training data, which are generated mostly through simulations. The
data generation time scales rapidly with the design domain size, decreasing the
efficiency of the method itself. Another major issue is the weak
generalizability of most deep learning models. Most models are trained to work
with the design problem similar to that used for data generation and require
retraining if the design problem changes. In this work a scalable deep
learning-based model-order-reduction method is proposed to accelerate
large-scale TO process, by utilizing MapNet, a neural network which maps the
field of interest from coarse-scale to fine-scale. The proposed method allows
for each simulation of the TO process to be performed at a coarser mesh,
thereby greatly reducing the total computational time. Moreover, by using
domain fragmentation, the transferability of the MapNet is largely improved.
Specifically, it has been demonstrated that the MapNet trained using data from
one cantilever beam design with a specific loading condition can be directly
applied to other structure design problems with different domain shapes, sizes,
boundary and loading conditions.

interactions. An engagement model trained end-to-end generates the reward
function in real-time during policy execution. We test this approach in a
public museum in Lincoln (UK), where the robot is deployed as a tour guide for
the visitors. Results show that after a couple of months of exploration, the
robot policy learned to maintain the engagement of users for longer, with an
increase of 22.8% over the initial static policy in the number of items visited
during the tour and a 30% increase in the probability of completing the tour.
This work is a promising step toward behavioural adaptation in long-term
scenarios for robotics applications in social settings.

navigation were successfully solved: UAV flight to a given point in space,
avoidance of interception by another UAV, and organization of interception of
one UAV by another. The three most relevant modern deep reinforcement learning
algorithms, Soft actor-critic, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, and Twin

planets have provided unprecedented details to probe atmospheric dynamics in a
new regime. Questions about mechanisms governing global circulation remain to
be addressed. Previous studies have shown that small-scale, randomly varying
thermal perturbations resulting from interactions between convection and the
overlying stratified layers can drive zonal jet streams, waves, and turbulence.
Here, we improve upon our previous general circulation model by using a
two-stream grey radiative transfer scheme to represent more realistic heating
and cooling rates. We examine the formation of zonal jets and their time
evolution, and vertical mixing of passive tracers including clouds and chemical
species. Under relatively weak radiative and frictional dissipation, robust
zonal jets with speeds up to a few hundred $\rm m\;s^{-1}$ are typical
outcomes. The off-equatorial jets tend to be pressure-independent while the
equatorial jets exhibit significant vertical wind shear. Models with strong
dissipation inhibit jet formation and have isotropic turbulence in
off-equatorial regions. Quasi-periodic oscillations of the equatorial flow with
periods ranging from tens of days to months are prevalent at relatively low
atmospheric temperatures. Sub-micron cloud particles can be transported to
several scale heights above the condensation level, while larger particles form
thinner layers. Cloud decks are inhomogeneous near their cloud tops. Chemical
tracers with chemical timescales $>10^5$ s can be driven out of equilibrium.
The equivalent vertical diffusion coefficients, $K_{\mathrm{zz}}$, for the
global-mean tracer, are diagnosed from our models and are typically on the
order of $1\sim10^2\rm m^2\;s^{-1}$. Finally, we derive an analytic estimation
of $K_{\mathrm{zz}}$ for different types of tracers under relevant conditions.

The existing methods fail to fully capture the dynamics of the structured world

i.e., detecting text in individual images, recognizing localized text, tracking
text streams with post-processing to generate final results. These methods
typically follow the tracking-by-match paradigm and develop sophisticated
pipelines. In this paper, rooted in Transformer sequence modeling, we propose a
simple, but effective end-to-end video text DEtection, Tracking, and
Recognition framework (TransDETR). TransDETR mainly includes two advantages: 1)
Different from the explicit match paradigm in the adjacent frame, TransDETR
tracks and recognizes each text implicitly by the different query termed text
query over long-range temporal sequence (more than 7 frames). 2) TransDETR is
the first end-to-end trainable video text spotting framework, which
simultaneously addresses the three sub-tasks (e.g., text detection, tracking,
recognition). Extensive experiments in four video text datasets (i.e.,ICDAR2013
Video, ICDAR2015 Video, Minetto, and YouTube Video Text) are conducted to
demonstrate that TransDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to
around 8.0% improvements on video text spotting tasks. The code of TransDETR

paths for a team of agents from their start to goal locations in an environment
cluttered with obstacles. Typical approaches for MAPF consider the locations of
obstacles as being fixed, which limits their effectiveness in automated
warehouses, where obstacles (representing pods or shelves) can be moved out of
the way by agents (representing robots) to relieve bottlenecks and introduce
shorter routes. In this work we initiate the study of MAPF with movable
obstacles. In particular, we introduce a new extension of MAPF, which we call
Terraforming MAPF (tMAPF), where some agents are responsible for moving
obstacles to clear the way for other agents. Solving tMAPF is extremely
challenging as it requires reasoning not only about collisions between agents,
but also where and when obstacles should be moved. We present extensions of two
state-of-the-art algorithms, CBS and PBS, in order to tackle tMAPF, and
demonstrate that they can consistently outperform the best solution possible

an elastic interface slowly driven in a random medium. It describes the
spatio-temporal statistics of the velocity field, and, to some extent is
analytically tractable. We extend our previous studies to obtain several
observables for the BFM with short range elasticity, related to the local jump
sizes $S(x)$ and to the avalanche spatial extension in $d=1$, or the avalanche
span in $d>1$. In $d=1$ we consider both driving (i) by an imposed force (ii)
by an imposed displacement ""at the tip"" and obtain in each case the mean
spatial shape $\langle S(x) \rangle$ at fixed extension, or at fixed seed to
edge distance. We find that near an edge $x_e$, $S(x) \simeq \sigma |x-x_e|^3$
where $\sigma$ has a universal distribution that we obtain. We also obtain the
spatiotemporal shape near the edge. In $d>1$ we obtain (i) the mean shape

processing. Recent works treat named entity recognition as a reading
comprehension task, constructing type-specific queries manually to extract
entities. This paradigm suffers from three issues. First, type-specific queries
can only extract one type of entities per inference, which is inefficient.
Second, the extraction for different types of entities is isolated, ignoring
the dependencies between them. Third, query construction relies on external
knowledge and is difficult to apply to realistic scenarios with hundreds of
entity types. To deal with them, we propose Parallel Instance Query Network
(PIQN), which sets up global and learnable instance queries to extract entities
from a sentence in a parallel manner. Each instance query predicts one entity,
and by feeding all instance queries simultaneously, we can query all entities
in parallel. Instead of being constructed from external knowledge, instance
queries can learn their different query semantics during training. For training
the model, we treat label assignment as a one-to-many Linear Assignment Problem
(LAP) and dynamically assign gold entities to instance queries with minimal

recognize specific categories of objects on a real scene scan (without scene
annotation for supervision). The problem studies how to transfer knowledge from
synthetic 3D models to real 3D scenes and is named Referring Transfer Learning
(RTL). The main challenge is solving the model-to-scene (from a single model to
the scene) and synthetic-to-real (from synthetic model to real scene's object)
gap between the synthetic model and the real scene. To this end, we propose a
simple yet effective framework to perform two alignment operations. First,
physical data alignment aims to make the synthetic models cover the diversity
of the scene's objects with data processing techniques. Then a novel
\textbf{convex-hull regularized feature alignment} introduces learnable
prototypes to project the point features of both synthetic models and real

plethora of important industrial, technological, and medical applications.
Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, here we investigate the
properties of a polyelectrolyte solution, with explicit counterions and
implicit solvent, that is driven by a steady electric field. By properly tuning
the interplay between interparticle electrostatics and the applied electric
field, we uncover two nonequilibrium continuous phase transitions as a function
of the driving field. The first transition occurs from a homogeneously mixed
phase to a macroscopically charge segregated phase, in which the
polyelectrolyte solution self-organizes to form two lanes of like-charges,
parallel to the applied field. We show that the fundamental underlying factor
responsible for the emergence of this charge segregation in the presence of
electric field is the excluded volume interactions of the drifting
polyelectrolyte chains. As the drive is increased further, a re-entrant
transition is observed from a charge segregated phase to a homogeneous phase.
The re-entrance is signaled by the decrease in mobility of the monomers and
counterions, as the electric field is increased. Furthermore, with multivalent
counterions, a counterintuitive regime of negative differential mobility is
observed, in which the charges move progressively slower as the driving field
is increased. We show that all these features can be consistently explained by
an intuitive trapping mechanism that operates between the oppositely moving
charges, and present numerical evidence to support our claims. Parameter
dependencies and phase diagrams are studied to better understand charge
segregation in such driven polyelectrolyte solutions.

timedelayed local two-way (TD-LTW) optical frequency comparison scheme with
improved comparison stability, showing that the fractional instability of
optical frequency comparison over a 50- km transfer link can be reduced from
$1.30\times10^{-15}$ to $5.25\times10^{-16}$ at the 1 s integration time with
an improvement factor of 2.48. Additionally, we also for the first time model
and experimentally verify the effect of the inhomogeneous phase noise along the
fiber link on the system performance. We believe that the theory and technique
proposed here will be helpful in developing the high-stability optical clock
networks over large-area fiber links.

remarkable results in natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. However,
their performances can drastically deteriorate when logical reasoning is

According to the dual-process theory, analogical reasoning and logical
reasoning are respectively carried out by System 1 and System 2 in the human
brain. Inspired by the theory, we present a novel framework for NLU called
Neural-Symbolic Processor (NSP), which performs analogical reasoning based on
neural processing and logical reasoning based on both neural and symbolic
processing. As a case study, we conduct experiments on two NLU tasks, question

(a type of logical reasoning) is necessary. The experimental results show that
our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both tasks.

identify individuals who are more likely to share fake-news by studying the
language of actors in the fake-news ecosystem (such as fake-news sharers,
fact-check sharers and random twitter users), and creating a linguistic profile
of them. Fake-news sharers and fact-check sharers use significantly more
high-arousal negative emotions in their language, but fake-news sharers express
more existentially-based needs than other actors. Incorporating
psycholinguistic cues as inferred from their tweets into a model of
socio-demographic predictors considerably improves classification accuracy of
fake-news sharers. The finding that fake-news sharers differ in important ways
from other actors in the fake-news ecosystem (such as in their existential

to increase accuracy in identification and prediction. Our approach can help
mitigate fake-news sharing by enabling platforms to pre-emptively screen

increasingly popular over the past decade. Information extracted from devices
using accelerometers is frequently summarized as ``number of steps"" (commercial
devices) or ``activity counts"" (research-grade devices). Raw accelerometry data
that can be easily extracted from accelerometers used in research, for instance
ActiGraph GT3X+, are frequently discarded. Approach: Our primary goal is
proposing an innovative use of the {\em de-shape synchrosqueezing transform} to
analyze the raw accelerometry data recorded from a single sensor installed in
different body locations, particularly the wrist, to extract {\em gait cadence}
when a subject is walking. The proposed methodology is tested on data collected
in a semi-controlled experiment with 32 participants walking on a one-kilometer
predefined course. Walking was executed on a flat surface as well as on the
stairs (up and down). Main Results: The cadences of walking on a flat surface,
ascending stairs, and descending stairs, determined from the wrist sensor, are
1.98$\pm$0.15 Hz, 1.99$\pm$0.26 Hz, and 2.03$\pm$0.26 Hz respectively. The
cadences are 1.98$\pm$0.14 Hz, 1.97$\pm$0.25 Hz, and 2.02$\pm$0.23 Hz,
respectively if determined from the hip sensor, 1.98$\pm$0.14 Hz, 1.93$\pm$0.22
Hz and 2.06$\pm$0.24 Hz, respectively if determined from the left ankle sensor,
and 1.98$\pm$0.14 Hz, 1.97$\pm$0.22 Hz, and 2.04$\pm$0.24 Hz, respectively if
determined from the right ankle sensor. The difference is statistically
significant indicating that the cadence is fastest while descending stairs and
slowest when ascending stairs. Also, the standard deviation when the sensor is
on the wrist is larger. These findings are in line with our expectations.
Conclusion: We show that our proposed algorithm can extract the cadence with
high accuracy, even when the sensor is placed on the wrist.

receiving more and more attention because of the great expressive power of
graphs. GNNs map the adjacency matrix and node features to node representations
by message passing through edges on each convolution layer. However, the
message passed through GNNs is not always beneficial for all parts in a graph.
Specifically, as the data distribution is different over the graph, the
receptive field (the farthest nodes that a node can obtain information from)
needed to gather information is also different. Existing GNNs treat all parts
of the graph uniformly, which makes it difficult to adaptively pass the most
informative message for each unique part. To solve this problem, we propose two
regularization terms that consider message passing locally: (1) Intra-Energy
Reg and (2) Inter-Energy Reg. Through experiments and theoretical discussion,
we first show that the speed of smoothing of different parts varies enormously
and the topology of each part affects the way of smoothing. With Intra-Energy
Reg, we strengthen the message passing within each part, which is beneficial
for getting more useful information. With Inter-Energy Reg, we improve the
ability of GNNs to distinguish different nodes. With the proposed two
regularization terms, GNNs are able to filter the most useful information
adaptively, learn more robustly and gain higher expressiveness. Moreover, the
proposed LEReg can be easily applied to other GNN models with plug-and-play
characteristics. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks verify that GNNs
with LEReg outperform or match the state-of-the-art methods. The effectiveness
and efficiency are also empirically visualized with elaborate experiments.

expectations about their applications for everyday living tasks are getting
higher. Robots need to perform long-horizon tasks that consist of several
sub-tasks that need to be accomplished. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)
provides a hierarchical framework to handle the sequential nature of
manipulation tasks by interleaving a symbolic task planner that generates a
possible action sequence, with a motion planner that checks the kinematic
feasibility in the geometric world, generating robot trajectories if several
constraints are satisfied, e.g., a collision-free trajectory from one state to
another. Hence, the reasoning about the task plan's geometric grounding is
taken over by the motion planner. However, motion planning is computationally
intense and is usability as feasibility checker casts TAMP methods inapplicable
to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce neural feasibility
classifier (NFC), a simple yet effective visual heuristic for classifying the
feasibility of proposed actions in TAMP. Namely, NFC will identify infeasible
actions of the task planner without the need for costly motion planning, hence
reducing planning time in multi-step manipulation tasks. NFC encodes the image
of the robot's workspace into a feature map thanks to convolutional neural
network (CNN). We train NFC using simulated data from TAMP problems and label
the instances based on IK feasibility checking. Our empirical results in
different simulated manipulation tasks show that our NFC generalizes to the
entire robot workspace and has high prediction accuracy even in scenes with
multiple obstructions. When combined with state-of-the-art integrated TAMP, our
NFC enhances its performance while reducing its planning time.

observation process and underlying state sequence form a two-dimensional Markov
chain, it is a natural generalization of a hidden Markov model. To demonstrate
the richness of the class of PMMs, we examine closer a few examples of rather
different types of PMMs: a model for two related Markov chains, a model that
allows to model an inhomogeneous Markov chain as a homogeneous one and a
semi-Markov model. The segmentation problem assumes that one of the marginal
processes is observed and the other one is not, the problem is to estimate the
unobserved state path given the observations. The standard state path
estimators often used are the so-called Viterbi path (a sequence with maximum
state path probability given the observations) or the pointwise maximum a
posteriori (PMAP) path (a sequence that maximizes the conditional state
probability for given observations pointwise). Both these estimators have their

column density (Nhxigm), temperature and metallicity using XMM-Newton QSO
spectra over a large redshift range, with a collisional ionisation equilibrium
(CIE) model for the ionised plasma. The Nhxigm parameter results were robust
with respect to intrinsic power laws, spectral counts, reflection hump and soft
excess features. There is scope for a luminosity bias given both luminosity and
Nhxigm scale with redshift, but we find this unlikely given the consistent IGM
parameter results across the other tracer types reviewed. The impact of
intervening high column density absorbers was found to be minimal. The Nhxigm
from the QSO sample scales as (1 + z)^1.5+/-0.2. The mean hydrogen density at z
= 0 is n0 = (2.8 +/- 0.3) x 10^-7 cm^-3, the mean IGM temperature over the full
redshift range is log(T/K) = 6.5+/-0.1, and the mean metallicity is [X/H] =
-1.3+/-0.1(Z 0.05). Aggregating with our previous GRB and blazar tracers, we
conclude that we have provided evidence of the IGM contributing substantially
and consistently to the total X-ray absorption seen in the spectra. These
results are based on the necessarily simplistic slab model used for the IGM,

natural choice to study such compact objects in context of modified gravity
theories which reduce to General Relativity (GR) in the low energy regime. We

Kuchowicz function as one of the metric potentials, which leads to many new
interesting results and physical features from our analysis as discussed in
this paper. Also, we provide essential additional stability checks on our
gravastar model to investigate the possibility of any instability creeping in
due to the higher dimensional framework. Our present improved gravastar model
is found to clear all the stability checks successfully. Very interestingly,
the static spherically symmetric matter distributions are found to accommodate
both classes of solutions obeying and violating the modified energy conditions

the Kuchowicz metric potential is very effective for describing regular
solutions to compact objects at substantially high energies on the 3-brane.

  Multi-Task Regression","20 pages, 9 figures, accepted by CHIL 2022",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Heart rate variability (HRV) is a practical and noninvasive measure of
autonomic nervous system activity, which plays an essential role in
cardiovascular health. However, using HRV to assess physiology status is
challenging. Even in clinical settings, HRV is sensitive to acute stressors
such as physical activity, mental stress, hydration, alcohol, and sleep.
Wearable devices provide convenient HRV measurements, but the irregularity of
measurements and uncaptured stressors can bias conventional analytical methods.
To better interpret HRV measurements for downstream healthcare applications, we
learn a personalized diurnal rhythm as an accurate physiological indicator for
each individual. We develop Physiological Multitask-Learning (PhysioMTL) by
harnessing Optimal Transport theory within a Multitask-learning (MTL)
framework. The proposed method learns an individual-specific predictive model
from heterogeneous observations, and enables estimation of an optimal transport
map that yields a push forward operation onto the demographic features for each
task. Our model outperforms competing MTL methodologies on unobserved
predictive tasks for synthetic and two real-world datasets. Specifically, our
method provides remarkable prediction results on unseen held-out subjects given
only $20\%$ of the subjects in real-world observational studies. Furthermore,
our model enables a counterfactual engine that generates the effect of acute
stressors and chronic conditions on HRV rhythms.

platform in China, for training and serving GNN-based recommendations over
web-scale graphs. ZOOMER is designed for tackling two challenges presented by
the massive user data at Taobao: low training/serving efficiency due to the
huge scale of the graphs, and low recommendation quality due to the information
overload which distracts the recommendation model from specific user
intentions. ZOOMER achieves this by introducing a key concept, Region of
Interests (ROI) in GNNs for recommendations, i.e., a neighborhood region in the
graph with significant relevance to a strong user intention. ZOOMER narrows the
focus from the whole graph and ""zooms in"" on the more relevant ROIs, thereby
reducing the training/serving cost and mitigating the information overload at
the same time. With carefully designed mechanisms, ZOOMER identifies the
interest expressed by each recommendation request, constructs an ROI subgraph
by sampling with respect to the interest, and guides the GNN to reweigh
different parts of the ROI towards the interest by a multi-level attention
module. Deployed as a large-scale distributed system, ZOOMER supports graphs
with billions of nodes for training and thousands of requests per second for
serving. ZOOMER achieves up to 14x speedup when downsizing sampling scales with
comparable (even better) AUC performance than baseline methods. Besides, both
the offline evaluation and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of
ZOOMER.

College of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (available at
https://www.youtube.com/derekkorg), though the first draft was created for a
previous course I taught at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany. It
has been designed for students who have only had basic training on quantum
mechanics, and hence, the course is suited for people at all levels. The notes
are a work in progress, meaning that some proofs and many figures are still
missing. However, I've tried my best to write everything in such a way that a
reader can follow naturally all arguments and derivations even with these
missing bits. Quantum optics treats the interaction between light and matter.
We may think of light as the optical part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and
matter as atoms. However, modern quantum optics covers a wild variety of
systems, including superconducting circuits, confined electrons, excitons in
semiconductors, defects in solid state, or the center-of-mass motion of micro-,
meso-, and macroscopic systems. Moreover, quantum optics is at the heart of the
field of quantum information. The ideas and experiments developed in quantum
optics have also allowed us to take a fresh look at many-body problems and even
high-energy physics. In addition, quantum optics holds the promise of testing
foundational problems in quantum mechanics as well as physics beyond the
standard model in table-sized experiments. Quantum optics is therefore a topic
that no future researcher in quantum physics should miss.

in the last decade, with recent research efforts highlighting phonon chirality,
Berry curvature of phonon band structure, and the phonon Hall effect. When a
phonon is resonantly coupled to a crystal electric field excitation, a
so-called vibronic bound state forms. Here, we observe angular momentum
transfer of $\delta$Jz = $\pm$1$\hbar$ between phonons and an orbital state in
a vibronic bound state of a candidate quantum spin liquid. This observation has
profound implications for the engineering of phonon band structure topology
through chiral quasiparticle interactions.

experiences of crowdsourced creative work on two of the leading crowdsourcing
platforms. The thesis has two parts. In the first part, we explore creative
work from the perspective of the crowd worker. In the second part, we explore
and study the requester's perspective in different contexts and several case
studies. The research is exploratory and we contribute empirical insights using
survey-based and artefact-based approaches common in the field of
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In the former approach, we explore the key
issues that may limit creative work on paid crowdsourcing platforms. In the
latter approach, we create computational artefacts to elicit authentic
experiences from both crowd workers and requesters of crowdsourced creative
work. The thesis contributes a classification of crowd workers into five
archetypal profiles, based on the crowd workers' demographics, disposition, and
preferences for creative work. We propose a three-part classification of
creative work on crowdsourcing platforms: creative tasks, creativity tests, and
creativity judgements (also referred to as creative feedback). The thesis
further investigates the emerging research topic of how requesters can be
supported in interpreting and evaluating complex creative work. Last, we
discuss the design implications for research and practice and contribute a
vision of creative work on future crowdsourcing platforms with the aim of
empowering crowd workers and fostering an ecosystem around tailored platforms
for creative microwork.

processing. While deep reinforcement learning has shown effectiveness in
developing the game playing agent, the low sample efficiency and the large
action space remain to be the two major challenges that hinder the DRL from
being applied in the real world. In this paper, we address the challenges by
introducing world-perceiving modules, which automatically decompose tasks and
prune actions by answering questions about the environment. We then propose a
two-phase training framework to decouple language learning from reinforcement
learning, which further improves the sample efficiency. The experimental
results show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance
and sample efficiency. Besides, it shows robustness against compound error and
limited pre-training data.

adapt to out-of-domain datasets. A single network may overfit to the
superficial correlation in the training distribution, but with a meaningful
number of expert sub-networks, a gating network that selects a sparse
combination of experts for each input, and careful balance on the importance of
expert sub-networks, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model allows us to train a
multi-task learner that can be generalized to out-of-domain datasets. We also
explore the possibility of bringing the MoE layers up to the middle of the
DistilBERT and replacing the dense feed-forward network with a
sparsely-activated switch FFN layers, similar to the Switch Transformer
architecture, which simplifies the MoE routing algorithm with reduced
communication and computational costs. In addition to model architectures, we
explore techniques of data augmentation including Easy Data Augmentation (EDA)
and back translation, to create more meaningful variance among the small
out-of-domain training data, therefore boosting the performance and robustness
of our models. In this paper, we show that our combination of best architecture
and data augmentation techniques achieves a 53.477 F1 score in the
out-of-domain evaluation, which is a 9.52% performance gain over the baseline.
On the final test set, we reported a higher 59.506 F1 and 41.651 EM. We
successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixture-of-Expert architecture in
a Robust QA task.

raises the need for an efficient automated radiology report analysis system to
alleviate the workloads of radiologists and encourage precise diagnosis. In
this work, we present RadText, an open-source radiology text analysis system

including de-identification, section segmentation, sentence split and word
tokenization, named entity recognition, parsing, and negation detection.
RadText features a flexible modular design, provides a hybrid text processing
schema, and supports raw text processing and local processing, which enables
better usability and improved data privacy. RadText adopts BioC as the unified
interface, and also standardizes the input / output into a structured
representation compatible with Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
(OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM). This allows for a more systematic approach to
observational research across multiple, disparate data sources. We evaluated
RadText on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, with five new disease labels we annotated for

displacement of the movable electrode, is used to obtain the Hamiltonian of the
hybrid actuator in terms of displacement. We then use graphical
energy-displacement and phase portrait plots to analyze static pull-in, dynamic
pull-in and pull-out phenomena of the hybrid actuator. Using these, we
illustrate the low-voltage operation of the hybrid actuator to static and step

in agreement with the analytical predictions and numerical simulations. The
proposed framework enables straightforward inclusion of adhesion between the

pull-in voltage is not affected, while the pull-out voltage is reduced due to
adhesion. The proposed framework provides a physics-based tool to design and
