of related applications such as augmented reality or photo album management.
The main challenge of this task lies in the imperfectness of similarities among
image feature representations. Given an existing feature extraction model, it
is still an unresolved problem that how can the inherent characteristics of
similarities of unlabelled images be leveraged to improve the clustering
performance. Motivated by answering the question, we develop an effective
unsupervised method, named as FaceMap, by formulating face clustering as a
process of non-overlapping community detection, and minimizing the entropy of
information flows on a network of images. The entropy is denoted by the map
equation and its minimum represents the least description of paths among images
in expectation. Inspired by observations on the ranked transition probabilities
in the affinity graph constructed from facial images, we develop an outlier
detection strategy to adaptively adjust transition probabilities among images.
Experiments with ablation studies demonstrate that FaceMap significantly
outperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-arts on three
popular large-scale datasets for face clustering, e.g., an absolute improvement
of more than $10\%$ and $4\%$ comparing with prior unsupervised and supervised
methods respectively in terms of average of Pairwise F-score. Our code is
publicly available on github.

  The advanced open-vocabulary two-stage detectors employ instance-level

  However, in the more efficient one-stage detector, the absence of

  In this paper, we propose a hierarchical visual-language knowledge
distillation method, i.e., HierKD, for open-vocabulary one-stage detection.
  Specifically, a global-level knowledge distillation is explored to transfer
the knowledge of unseen categories from the PVLM to the detector.
  Moreover, we combine the proposed global-level knowledge distillation and the
common instance-level knowledge distillation to learn the knowledge of seen and
unseen categories simultaneously.
  Extensive experiments on MS-COCO show that our method significantly surpasses
the previous best one-stage detector with 11.9\% and 6.7\% $AP_{50}$ gains

for the weak approximation of parabolic semilinear stochastic PDEs driven by
additive space-time white noise. The new method can easily be combined with a
finite difference method for the spatial discretization. The proposed method is
shown to have improved qualitative properties compared with the standard
method. First, for any time-step size, the spatial regularity of the solution
is preserved, at all times. Second, the proposed method preserves the Gaussian
invariant distribution of the infinite dimensional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process
obtained when the nonlinearity is absent, for any time-step size. The weak
order of convergence of the proposed method is shown to be equal to $1/2$ in a
general setting, like for the standard Euler scheme. A stronger weak
approximation result is obtained when considering the approximation of a Gibbs
invariant distribution, when the nonlinearity is a gradient: one obtains an
approximation in total variation distance of order $1/2$, which does not hold
for the standard method. This is the first result of this type in the
literature. A key point in the analysis is the interpretation of the proposed
modified Euler scheme as the accelerated exponential Euler scheme applied to a
modified stochastic evolution equation. Finally, it is shown that the proposed
method can be applied to design an asymptotic preserving scheme for a class of
slow-fast multiscale systems, and to construct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method which is well-defined in infinite dimension. We also revisit the
analysis of the standard and the accelerated exponential Euler scheme, and we
prove new results with approximation in the total variation distance, which

mysterious radiation domination era? Addressing this question is the focus in
this work, and we shall consider the case for which in the early stages of the
radiation domination era, namely during the reheating era, the background
equation of state parameter is different from $w=1/3$. As we show, in the
context of $f(R)$ gravity, an abnormal reheating era can affect the primordial
gravitational wave energy spectrum today. Since future interferometers will
exactly probe this era, which consists of subhorizon modes that reentered the
horizon during the early stages of the radiation domination era, the focus in
this work is how a short abnormal reheating era that deviates from the standard
perfect fluid pattern with $w\neq 1/3$, and generated by higher order curvature
terms, can affect the primordial gravitational wave energy spectrum. Using a
WKB approach, we calculate the effect of an $f(R)$ gravity generated abnormal
reheating era, and as we show the primordial gravitational wave spectrum is
significantly amplified, a result which is in contrast to the general

systems that leveraged the acoustoelectric effect between phonons and charge
carriers could revolutionize radio frequency electronic systems by allowing
nonlinear and nonreciprocal functionalities such as gain and isolation to be
achieved in the acoustic domain. Despite six decades of work, no
acoustoelectric amplifier has been produced that can achieve a large net
(terminal) gain at microwave frequencies with low power consumption and noise
figure. Here we demonstrate a novel three-layer acoustoelectric heterostructure
that enables the first-ever continuously operating acoustoelectric amplifier
with terminal gain at gigahertz frequencies. We achieve a terminal gain of
11.25 dB in a 500 micron long device, operating at 1 GHz with a DC power
dissipation of 19.6 mW. We also realize broadband gain from 0.25-3.4 GHz and
nonreciprocal transmission exceeding 44 dB at 1 GHz. Our acoustic noise figure
is 2.8 dB, which is the lowest-ever demonstrated noise figure for an
acoustoelectric amplifier. We discuss generally how to optimize these
acoustoelectric heterostructures and show that it should be immediately
achievable to produce devices with even larger gain in shorter lengths while
simultaneously having lower power consumption and noise figure.

train a deep learning detector with a re-weighted loss function to localize
abnormal findings. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of the

The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms

robot locomotion to settings where external, dynamic objects are involved whose
properties are partially observable to the robot. As a first step toward this
goal, we build a simulation environment in MuJoCo where a legged robot must
avoid getting hit by a ball moving toward it. We explore whether prior
locomotion experiences that animals typically possess benefit the learning of a
reactive control policy under a proposed hierarchical reinforcement learning

efficient using this hierarchical reinforcement learning method, even when
partial observability (radius-based object visibility) is taken into account.

generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) approach to quantizing gravity: namely
that different pairs of modified operators with the same modified commutator,
$[\hat{X},\hat{P}] = i \hbar (1+\beta p^2)$, may have different physical
consequences such as having no minimal length at all. These differences depend
on how the position and/or momentum operators are modified rather than only on
the resulting modified commutator. This provides guidance when constructing GUP
models since it distinguishes those GUPs that have a minimal length scale, as
suggested by some broad arguments about quantum gravity, versus GUPs without a
minimal length scale.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recommender systems are highly prevalent in the modern world due to their
value to both users and platforms and services that employ them. Generally,
they can improve the user experience and help to increase satisfaction, but
they do not come without risks. One such risk is that of their effect on users
and their ability to play an active role in shaping user preferences. This risk
is more significant for reinforcement learning based recommender systems. These
are capable of learning for instance, how recommended content shown to a user
today may tamper that user's preference for other content recommended in the
future. Reinforcement learning based recommendation systems can thus implicitly
learn to influence users if that means maximizing clicks, engagement, or
consumption. On social news and media platforms, in particular, this type of
behavior is cause for alarm. Social media undoubtedly plays a role in public
opinion and has been shown to be a contributing factor to increased political
polarization. Recommender systems on such platforms, therefore, have great
potential to influence users in undesirable ways. However, it may also be
possible for this form of manipulation to be used intentionally. With
advancements in political opinion dynamics modeling and larger collections of
user data, explicit user manipulation in which the beliefs and opinions of
users are tailored towards a certain end emerges as a significant concern in
reinforcement learning based recommender systems.

is justified by rigorous analysis on controllability and observability
properties of mixed traffic. We then employ a receding horizon strategy to
solve a finite-horizon optimal control problem at each time step, in which
input/output constraints are incorporated for collision-free guarantees.
Numerical experiments validate the performance of DeeP-LCC compared to a
standard predictive controller that requires an accurate model. Multiple
nonlinear traffic simulations further confirm its great potential on improving

osteolytic lesions, and results in skeletal related events (SREs) including
severe pain and even fatal fractures. Although current imaging techniques can
detect macroscopic bone lesions, predicting the occurrence and progression of

strong FE insulator into an FE metal provided that the induced free electrons
do not destroy FE distortion. Strained EuTiO$_{3}$ film is a strong FE
ferromagnet and a promising candidate for such a strategy. Here, we calculate
the structural, electronic, and polarization properties of Nb-doped strained
EuTiO$_{3}$ film using the hybrid density-functional theory. The results show
that the strained EuTi$_{0.875}$Nb$_{0.125}$O$_{3}$ film is a strong FE metal
as the Nb doping induces metallicity without weakening the FE distortion. The
underlying atomistic mechanism of the coexistence of metallicity and strong

stating that given two real sequences $(\lambda_n)_{n=1}^\infty$,
$(\mu_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ satisfying the intertwining relations \[ |\lambda_1| >
|\mu_1| > |\lambda_2| > |\mu_2| > ...> |\lambda_n| > |\mu_n|>\ldots >0 , \qquad
\lambda_n\to 0, \] there exists a unique compact Hankel operator $\Gamma$ such
that $\lambda_n$ are the (simple) eigenvalues of $\Gamma$ and $\mu_n$ are the
simple eigenvalues of its truncation $\Gamma_1$ obtained from $\Gamma$ by
removing the first column.
  We use the dynamical systems approach originated in a paper by A. V.
Megretski, V.V. Peller. S. R. Treil in 1995, and the proof is split into three
independent parts. The first one, which is a slight modification of a result in
that paper, is an abstract operator-theoretic statement reducing the problem to
the asymptotic stability of some operators. The second one is the proof of the
asymptotic stability, which is usually the hardest part, but in our case of
compact operators it is almost trivial. And the third part is an abstract
version of the Borg's two spectra theorem, which is essentially a simple
exercise in graduate complex analysis.

and nonstationary. These properties hinder the development of scalable and
efficient solutions for time series forecasting and analysis. To address these
challenges, we propose a Nonstationary Temporal Matrix Factorization (NoTMF)
model, in which matrix factorization is used to reconstruct the whole time
series matrix and vector autoregressive (VAR) process is imposed on a properly
differenced copy of the temporal factor matrix. This approach not only
preserves the low-rank property of the data but also offers consistent temporal
dynamics. The learning process of NoTMF involves the optimization of two factor
matrices and a collection of VAR coefficient matrices. To efficiently solve the
optimization problem, we derive an alternating minimization framework, in which
subproblems are solved using conjugate gradient and least squares methods. In
particular, the use of conjugate gradient method offers an efficient routine
and allows us to apply NoTMF on large-scale problems. Through extensive
experiments on Uber movement speed dataset, we demonstrate the superior
accuracy and effectiveness of NoTMF over other baseline models. Our results
also confirm the importance of addressing the nonstationarity of real-world
time series data such as spatiotemporal traffic flow/speed.

$\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$) and their host galaxies ($\mathcal{M}_\star$) in the
reionization epoch provides valuable constraints on their early growth.
High-redshift quasars typically have a $\mathcal{M}_{\rm
BH}$/$\mathcal{M}_\star$ ratio significantly elevated in comparison to the
local value. However, the degree to which this apparent offset is driven by
observational biases is unclear for the most distant quasars. To address this
issue, we model the sample selection and measurement biases for a compilation
of 20 quasars at $z\sim6$ with host properties based on ALMA observations. We
find that the observed distribution of quasars in the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} -
\mathcal{M}_\star$ plane can be reproduced by assuming that the underlying SMBH
population at $z\sim6$ follows the relationship in the local universe. However,
a positive or even a negative evolution in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm
BH}$/$\mathcal{M}_\star$ can also explain the data, depending on whether the
intrinsic scatter evolves and the strength of various systematic uncertainties.
To break these degeneracies, an improvement in the accuracy of mass
measurements and an expansion of the current sample to lower $\mathcal{M}_{\rm
BH}$ limits are needed. Furthermore, assuming a radiative efficiency of 0.1 and
quasar duty cycles estimated from the active SMBH fraction, significant
outliers in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$/$\mathcal{M}_\star$ tend to move toward the
local relation given their instantaneous BH growth rate and star formation
rate. This may provide evidence for a self-regulated SMBH-galaxy coevolution
scenario that is in place at $z\sim6$, with AGN feedback being a possible
driver.

The dispersion relation is numerically solved and the results are compared with
situations previously studied where dust particles were not charged by
photoionization, which is an important process in a stellar wind of a
relatively hot star. We show that the presence of dust causes the shear
Alfv\'en waves to present a region of wavenumber values with zero frequency and
that the minimum wavelength for which the mode becomes dispersive again is
roughly proportional to the radiation intensity to which the dust grains are
exposed. The damping rates of both shear and compressional Alfv\'en waves are
observed to decrease with increasing radiation flux, for the parameters
considered. For the particular case where both modes present a region with null
real frequency when the radiation flux is absent or weak, it is shown that when
the radiation flux is sufficiently strong, the photoionization mechanism may
cause this region to get smaller or even to vanish, for compressional Alfv\'en
waves. In that case, the compressional Alfv\'en waves present non zero
frequency for all wavenumber values, while the shear Alfv\'en waves still
present null frequency in a certain interval of wavenumber values, which gets
smaller with the presence of radiation.

Despite these concerns, prior evidence on this algorithmic radicalization is

reduce the potential ideological bias in recommendation algorithms. We conduct
a systematic audit of YouTube's recommendation system using a hundred thousand
sock puppets to determine the presence of ideological bias (i.e., are
recommendations aligned with users' ideology), its magnitude (i.e., are users
recommended an increasing number of videos aligned with their ideology), and
radicalization (i.e., are the recommendations progressively more extreme).
Furthermore, we design and evaluate a bottom-up intervention to minimize
ideological bias in recommendations without relying on cooperation from
YouTube. We find that YouTube's recommendations do direct users -- especially
right-leaning users -- to ideologically biased and increasingly radical content
on both homepages and in up-next recommendations. Our intervention effectively
mitigates the observed bias, leading to more recommendations to ideologically
neutral, diverse, and dissimilar content, yet debiasing is especially
challenging for right-leaning users. Our systematic assessment shows that while
YouTube recommendations lead to ideological bias, such bias can be mitigated

the quantum probability density for a transition between their energies. If
either segment is part of a Bohr-quantized periodic orbit of either shell, the
centre of its endpoints lies on a scar disk of the spectral Wigner function for
single static energy shell and the contribution to the transition is reinforced
by phase coherence. The exact representation of the transition density as an
integral over spectral Wigner functions, which was previously derived for the
special case where the system undergoes a reflection in phase space, is here
generalized to arbitrary unitary transformations. If these are generated

touch each other and then start to overlap.
  The stationary phase evaluation of the multidimensional integral for the

orbit shows up as a fixed point of a product of mappings that generalize
Poincar\'e maps on the intersection of the shells. Thus, the closed compound
orbits are isolated if the original Hamiltonian is chaotic. The actions of the

limitation. Because estimation and control are not clearly separated in the LQG
problem with memory limitation, the Riccati equation is modified to the
partially observable Riccati equation, which improves estimation as well as
control. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ML-POSC to a non-LQG

adding a monomial $z^{d+m}$ to $f$ and $g$ so that the corresponding affine

two functions belong to different connected components of $\mu$-constant strata

realized electrically-controllable EB effects in a vdW antiferromagnetic

FePS3-Fe5GeTe2 heterostructures, sizable EB effects can be generated due to the
strong interface coupling, which also depend on the thickness of the
ferromagnetic layers. By applying a solid protonic gate, the EB effects can be
electrically tuned largely by proton intercalations and deintercalations. The
EB field reaches up to 23% of the coercive field and the blocking temperature
exceeds 50 K at Vg= -3.15 V. The proton intercalations not only tune the
average magnetic exchange coupling, but also change the AFM configurations and
transform the heterointerface between an uncompensated AFM-FM interface and a
compensated AFM-FM interface. These alterations result in a dramatic modulation

common issue as curating sufficiently large amount of annotated medical imaging
data is a long and costly process. While interest has been devoted to
explaining CNN learnt knowledge by visualizing network attention, the
utilization of the visualized attention to improve network learning has been
rarely investigated. This paper explores the effectiveness of regularizing CNN
network with human-provided attention guidance on where in the image the
network should look for answering clues. On two orthopedics radiographic
fracture classification datasets, through extensive experiments we demonstrate
that explicit human-guided attention indeed can direct correct network
attention and consequently significantly improve classification performance.
The development code for the proposed attention guidance is publicly available

simple objects like digits, the human faces with homologous structures, which
are suitable for capsules to describe, have not been explored. In this paper,
we propose a Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule) for unsupervised

labels, the network first encodes the frequently observed patterns with a set
of explainable subpart capsules. Then, the subpart capsules are assembled into
part-level capsules through a Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) to learn
the compositional relations between them. During training, as the face
hierarchy is progressively built and refined, the part capsules adaptively
encode the face parts with semantic consistency. HP-Capsule extends the
application of capsule networks from digits to human faces and takes a step
forward to show how the neural networks understand homologous objects without
human intervention. Besides, HP-Capsule gives unsupervised face segmentation
results by the covered regions of part capsules, enabling qualitative and
quantitative evaluation. Experiments on BP4D and Multi-PIE datasets show the
effectiveness of our method.

significant performance gains, demonstrating the importance and generality of
these training details. Our newly trained PWC-Net and IRR-PWC models show
surprisingly large improvements, up to 30% versus original published results on
Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks. They outperform the more recent Flow1D on
KITTI 2015 while being 3x faster during inference. Our newly trained RAFT
achieves an Fl-all score of 4.31% on KITTI 2015, more accurate than all
published optical flow methods at the time of writing. Our results demonstrate
the benefits of separating the contributions of models, training techniques and

malicious purpose. Our attack technique targets the inherent vulnerabilities of
NLP models, allowing us to generate samples even without interacting with the
victim NLP model, as long as it is based on pre-trained language models (PLMs).
Furthermore, we design a prompt-based adversarial training method to improve
the robustness of PLMs. As our training method does not actually generate
adversarial samples, it can be applied to large-scale training sets
efficiently. The experimental results show that our attack method can achieve a
high attack success rate with more diverse, fluent and natural adversarial
examples. In addition, our robustness enhancement method can significantly
improve the robustness of models to resist adversarial attacks. Our work
indicates that prompting paradigm has great potential in probing some

problem in computer vision with many applications. An important component of
this problem is 3D Temporal Action Localization (3D-TAL), which involves
recognizing what actions a person is performing, and when. State-of-the-art
3D-TAL methods employ a two-stage approach in which the action span detection
task and the action recognition task are implemented as a cascade. This
approach, however, limits the possibility of error-correction. In contrast, we
propose LocATe, an end-to-end approach that jointly localizes and recognizes
actions in a 3D sequence. Further, unlike existing autoregressive models that
focus on modeling the local context in a sequence, LocATe's transformer model
is capable of capturing long-term correlations between actions in a sequence.
Unlike transformer-based object-detection and classification models which
consider image or patch features as input, the input in 3D-TAL is a long
sequence of highly correlated frames. To handle the high-dimensional input, we
implement an effective input representation, and overcome the diffuse attention
across long time horizons by introducing sparse attention in the model. LocATe
outperforms previous approaches on the existing PKU-MMD 3D-TAL benchmark
(mAP=93.2%). Finally, we argue that benchmark datasets are most useful where
there is clear room for performance improvement. To that end, we introduce a
new, challenging, and more realistic benchmark dataset, BABEL-TAL-20 (BT20),
where the performance of state-of-the-art methods is significantly worse. The
dataset and code for the method will be available for research purposes.

three dust rings and a bright arc. A complex geometric configuration, with a
misaligned inner disk, is assumed to account for the asymmetric structures. The
two-dimensional surface density is constructed by iteratively fitting the ALMA

boundary of the misalignment. The ring masses range from 0.6 to 16Mearth that
are systematically lower than those inferred in the younger HL Tau disk. The
arc occupies nearly 20% of the total dust mass. Such a high mass fraction of
dust grains concentrated in a local region is consistent with the mechanism of
dust trapping into vortices. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 30 that is
constant throughout the disk, the dense and cold arc is close to the threshold
of being gravitationally unstable, with the Toomre parameter Q~1.3.
Nevertheless, our estimate of Q relies on the assumption for the unknown
gas-to-dust mass ratio. Adopting a lower gas-to-dust mass ratio would increase
the inferred Q value. Follow-up high resolution observations of dust and gas
lines are needed to clarify the origin of the substructures.

neural network models with a large number of weights (parameters), many
solutions can be found to fit the training data equally well. The key question
is which solution can describe testing data not in the training set. Here, we
report the discovery of an exact duality (equivalence) between changes in
activities in a given layer of neurons and changes in weights that connect to
the next layer of neurons in a densely connected layer in any feed forward
neural network. The activity-weight (A-W) duality allows us to map variations
in inputs (data) to variations of the corresponding dual weights. By using this
mapping, we show that the generalization loss can be decomposed into a sum of
contributions from different eigen-directions of the Hessian matrix of the loss
function at the solution in weight space. The contribution from a given
eigen-direction is the product of two geometric factors (determinants): the
sharpness of the loss landscape and the standard deviation of the dual weights,
which is found to scale with the weight norm of the solution. Our results
provide an unified framework, which we used to reveal how different
regularization schemes (weight decay, stochastic gradient descent with
different batch sizes and learning rates, dropout), training data size, and
labeling noise affect generalization performance by controlling either one or
both of these two geometric determinants for generalization. These insights can
be used to guide development of algorithms for finding more generalizable

of a spherically symmetric self-gravitating system in a $D$-dimensional
asymptotically Anti-de Sitter(AdS) spacetime. The system satisfies the
Einstein-Vlasov equations with a negative cosmological constant. Due to the
confined structure of the AdS potential, we can construct thermal equilibrium
states without any artificial wall in the asymptotically AdS spacetime.
Accordingly, the AdS radius can be regarded as the typical size of the system.
Then the system can be characterized by the gravothermal energy and AdS radius
normalized by the total particle number. We investigate the catastrophic
instability of the system in a $D$-dimensional spacetime by using the turning
point method. As a result, we find that the curve has a double spiral structure
for $4\le D\le 10$ while it does not have any spiral structures for $D\ge11$ as
in the asymptotically flat case confined by an adiabatic wall. Irrespective of
the existence of the spiral structure, there exist upper and lower bounds for
the value of the gravothermal energy. This fact indicates that there is no
thermal equilibrium solution outside the allowed region of the gravothermal
energy. This property is also similar to the asymptotically flat case.

languages, and that performance can be further improved via adaptation prior to
finetuning. However, it is unclear how the number of pretraining languages
influences a model's zero-shot learning for languages unseen during
pretraining. To fill this gap, we ask the following research questions: (1) How
does the number of pretraining languages influence zero-shot performance on
unseen target languages? (2) Does the answer to that question change with model
adaptation? (3) Do the findings for our first question change if the languages
used for pretraining are all related? Our experiments on pretraining with
related languages indicate that choosing a diverse set of languages is crucial.
Without model adaptation, surprisingly, increasing the number of pretraining
languages yields better results up to adding related languages, after which
performance plateaus. In contrast, with model adaptation via continued
pretraining, pretraining on a larger number of languages often gives further
improvement, suggesting that model adaptation is crucial to exploit additional
pretraining languages.

(nonparametric) Bayesian models. Critical to our approach is the combination of
an assumption of local Lipschitz-continuity for the posterior distribution with
a dynamic formulation of the Wasserstein distance, here referred to as
Wasserstein dynamics, which allows to set forth a connection between the
problem of establishing PCRs and some classical problems in mathematical
analysis, probability theory and mathematical statistics: the Laplace method
for approximating integrals, Sanov's large deviation principles in the
Wasserstein distance, rates of convergence of the mean Glivenko-Cantelli
theorem, and estimates of weighted Poincar\'e-Wirtinger constants. Under
dominated Bayesian models, we present two main results: i) a theorem on PCRs
for the regular infinite-dimensional exponential family of statistical models;
ii) a theorem on PCRs for a general dominated statistical model. Some
applications of our results are presented for the regular parametric model, the
multinomial model, the finite-dimensional and the infinite-dimensional
logistic-Gaussian model and the infinite-dimensional linear regression. In
general, our results lead to optimal PCRs in finite dimension, whereas in
infinite dimension it is shown how the prior distribution may affect PCRs. With
regards to infinite-dimensional Bayesian models for density estimation, our
approach to PCRs is the first to consider strong norm distances on parameter
spaces of functions, such as Sobolev-like norms, as most of the approaches in
the classical (frequentist) and Bayesian literature deal with spaces of density
functions endowed with $\mathrm{L}^p$ norms or the Hellinger distance.

the lower band, we find that the spontaneous emission is chiral with most

indicate that the Hofstadter-ladder waveguide can be engineered as a
well-performed chiral quantum bus. Second, the dynamics of emitters of giant

giant emitter's size. The periodical length depends on the positions of energy

We show that the proposed upper bounds can be computed in linear time. Then, we
develop a new branch-and-bound algorithm with a carefully-designed pivot
re-selection strategy to enumerate all $k$-plexes, which outputs all $k$-plexes
in $O(n^2\gamma_k^n)$ time theoretically, where $n$ is the number of vertices

large real-world graphs. Finally, extensive experimental results show that the
proposed sequential algorithm can achieve up to $2\times$ to $100\times$
speedup over the state-of-the-art sequential algorithms on most benchmark

generalization of neural networks by smoothing the decision boundary with mixed
data. Recently, dynamic mixup methods have improved previous static policies
effectively (e.g., linear interpolation) by maximizing salient regions or
maintaining the target in mixed samples. The discrepancy is that the generated
mixed samples from dynamic policies are more instance discriminative than the
static ones, e.g., the foreground objects are decoupled from the background.
However, optimizing mixup policies with dynamic methods in input space is an
expensive computation compared to static ones. Hence, we are trying to transfer
the decoupling mechanism of dynamic methods from the data level to the
objective function level and propose the general decoupled mixup (DM) loss. The
primary effect is that DM can adaptively focus on discriminative features
without losing the original smoothness of the mixup while avoiding heavy
computational overhead. As a result, DM enables static mixup methods to achieve
comparable or even exceed the performance of dynamic methods. This also leads
to an interesting objective design problem for mixup training that we need to
focus on both smoothing the decision boundaries and identifying discriminative
features. Extensive experiments on supervised and semi-supervised learning
benchmarks across seven classification datasets validate the effectiveness of
DM by equipping it with various mixup methods.

this paper, we consider two variations of the OCE. First, we introduce a
modified OCE by maximizing the combination of the utility of the cash and the
expected utility of the remaining uncertain income so that the combined

the true utility function is unknown but it is possible to use partially

mitigate the risk arising from the ambiguity, we introduce a robust model where
the modified OCE is based on the worst-case utility function from the ambiguity
set. In the case when the ambiguity set of utility functions is constructed by
a Kantorovich ball centered at a nominal utility function, we show how the
modified OCE and the corresponding worst case utility function can be
identified by solving two linear programs alternatively. We also show the
robust modified OCE is statistically robust in a data-driven environment where
the underlying data are potentially contaminated. Some preliminary numerical

borrow from the increasingly ubiquitous notion of adversarial training from
machine learning to construct a class of controllers which are optimized for
disturbances consisting of mixed stochastic and worst-case components. We find
that this problem admits a stationary optimal controller that has a simple
analytic form closely related to suboptimal $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ solutions. We
then provide a quantitative performance-robustness tradeoff analysis, in which
system-theoretic properties such as controllability and stability explicitly
manifest in an interpretable manner. This provides practitioners with general

the role of magnon squeezing in improving the cooling efficiency. The magnon
squeezing is obtained by exploiting the magnon self-Kerr nonlinearity. We find
that the magnon squeezing can significantly and even completely suppress the
magnomechanical Stokes scattering. It thus becomes particularly useful in
realizing ground-state cooling in the unresolved-sideband regime, where the
conventional sideband cooling protocols become inefficient. We also find that
the coupling to the microwave cavity plays only an adverse effect in mechanical

motion, in which the magnon mode is established by a uniform bias magnetic

applied in reverse engineering, where the point cloud analysis plays an
important role. While a large number of supervised learning methods have been
proposed to handle the unordered point clouds and demonstrated their remarkable
success, their performance and applicability are limited to the costly data
annotation. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised pretraining model
for point cloud learning without human annotations, which relies solely on
upsampling operation to perform feature learning of point cloud in an effective
manner. The key premise of our approach is that upsampling operation encourages
the network to capture both high-level semantic information and low-level
geometric information of the point cloud, thus the downstream tasks such as
classification and segmentation will benefit from the pre-trained model.
Specifically, our method first conducts the random subsampling from the input
point cloud at a low proportion e.g., 12.5%. Then, we feed them into an
encoder-decoder architecture, where an encoder is devised to operate only on
the subsampled points, along with a upsampling decoder is adopted to
reconstruct the original point cloud based on the learned features. Finally, we
design a novel joint loss function which enforces the upsampled points to be
similar with the original point cloud and uniformly distributed on the
underlying shape surface. By adopting the pre-trained encoder weights as
initialisation of models for downstream tasks, we find that our UAE outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods in shape classification, part segmentation
and point cloud upsampling tasks. Code will be made publicly available upon

However, in many binary classification tasks, samples in the minority class
only make up a small part of all instances, which leads to the datasets we get
usually suffer from high imbalance ratio. Existing models sometimes treat
minority classes as noise or ignore them as outliers encountering data skewing.
In order to solve this problem, we propose a bagging ensemble learning
framework $ASE$ (Anomaly Scoring Based Ensemble Learning). This framework has a
scoring system based on anomaly detection algorithms which can guide the
resampling strategy by divided samples in the majority class into subspaces.
Then specific number of instances will be under-sampled from each subspace to
construct subsets by combining with the minority class. And we calculate the
weights of base classifiers trained by the subsets according to the
classification result of the anomaly detection model and the statistics of the
subspaces. Experiments have been conducted which show that our ensemble
learning model can dramatically improve the performance of base classifiers and
is more efficient than other existing methods under a wide range of imbalance
ratio, data scale and data dimension. $ASE$ can be combined with various
classifiers and every part of our framework has been proved to be reasonable
and necessary.

  three-dimensional bipartite nanoparticle arrays","32 pages, 15 figures",,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical chirality (OC) is a fundamental property of electromagnetic waves
that plays a key role in governing chiral light-matter interaction. Here, we
demonstrate how to obtain superchiral surface lattice resonances (SLRs), which
arise from the hybridization between localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and
diffractive Rayleigh anomalies (RAs), in nanoparticle arrays. We first study
the coupling constants between LSPs and RAs in 2D Au monopartite nanorod arrays
by angle-resolved reflectivity spectroscopy and finite-difference time-domain
(FDTD) simulations. The complex dispersion relations and the near-fields of
SLRs are then analyzed by temporal coupled-mode theory (CMT) for formulating
the dependence of the coupling constants on the dipole orientation of the
nanorod. The TE and TM coupling constants are found to depend strongly on the
orientation of the dipole lying in the plane perpendicular to the propagation
direction of RA. By using two orthogonally oriented nanorods, TE- and TM-SLRs
can be excited independently. We then extend the CMT approach to rationally
design superchiral SLRs based on 3D bipartite nanorods. The OC is shown to
depend on the relative displacement between two nanorods, the near-field
strength, and the interplay between the coupling constants and the Q-factor of
the SLR resonance. We have achieved an averaged OC of 27 times stronger than
that of the circularly polarized plane wave over the entire surface, featuring
large area chiral surface waves that are useful for chirality-based
applications.

trajectory tracking of flexible link manipulators. The proposed approach is
mainly based on a sliding mode controller for underactuated systems with an
embedded artificial neural network to deal with modeling inaccuracies. The
adopted neural network only needs a single input and one hidden layer, which
drastically reduces the computational complexity of the control law and allows
its implementation in low-power microcontrollers. Online learning, rather than
supervised offline training, is chosen to allow the weights of the neural
network to be adjusted in real time during the tracking. Therefore, the
resulting controller is able to cope with the underactuating issues and to
adapt itself by learning from experience, which grants the capacity to deal
with plant dynamics properly. The boundedness and convergence properties of the
tracking error are proved by evoking Barbalat's lemma in a Lyapunov-like
stability analysis. Experimental results obtained with a small single-link
flexible manipulator show the efficacy of the proposed control scheme, even in
the presence of a high level of uncertainty and noisy signals.

school-year is to let each student write down a list of $d$ other students with

gather all the lists and try to assign the students to classes in a way that
each student is assigned to the same class with at least one student from
her/his list. We refer to such partitions as friendly. In realistic scenarios,
the teachers may also consider other constraints when picking the friendly
partition: e.g. there may be a group of students whom the teachers wish to
avoid assigning to the same class; alternatively, there may be two close
friends whom the teachers want to put together; etc.
  Inspired by such challenges, we explore questions concerning the
expressiveness of friendly partitions. For example: Does there always exist a
friendly partition? More generally, how many friendly partitions are there? Can
every student $u$ be separated from any other student $v$? Does there exist a
student $u$ that can be separated from any other student $v$?
  We show that when $d\geq 3$ there always exist at least $2$ friendly

separated from any other student $v$. The question regarding separability of
each pair of students is left open, but we give a positive answer under the
additional assumption that each student appears in at most roughly $\exp(d)$

incorporates a smoothness loss function to evaluate the smoothness of the
interpolated 3D medical volumes in the through-plane direction (sagittal and

volumes in the through-plane direction but also transforms them into isotropic

studied experimentally, together with the force induced by the pinning of the
contact line to surface defects. Different surfaces were considered with
circular defects introduced as arrays of cocoa butter patches or small circular
holes. These heterogeneous surfaces were submerged into aqueous ethanol
solutions, while measuring the additional force arising from the deformation of
the advancing contact line and characterising the interface shape and its
pinning on the defects. Initially, the submersion force is linear with
submerged depth, suggesting a constant defect-induced stiffness. This regime
ends when the contact line de pins from the defects. A simple scaling is
proposed to describe the depinning force and the depinning energy. We find
that, as the defect separation increases, the interface stiffness increases
too, with a weak dependency on the defect radius. This interaction between
defects cannot be captured by the simple scaling, but can be well predicted by
a theory considering the interface deformation in presence of periodic arrays
of holes. Creating a 4-phase contact line, by including solid defects (cocoa
butter) reduced pinning forces. The radius of the defect had a nonlinear effect
on the depinning depth. The 4-phase contact line resulted in depinning before
the defects are fully submerged. These experimental results and the associated
theory help understanding quantitatively the extent to which surface
heterogeneities can slow down wetting. This in turn paves the way to tailor the
design of heterogeneous surfaces, towards desired wetting performances.

lower bound via approximating the oracle model by a pre-trained model, called
Mutual Information Regularization with Oracle (MIRO). Our extensive experiments
show that MIRO significantly improves the out-of-distribution performance.
Furthermore, our scaling experiments show that the larger the scale of the
pre-trained model, the greater the performance improvement of MIRO. Source code

steadfast computational dimensions. Such inflexibility restricts it from
possessing context-oriented generalization that can bring more contextual cues
and global representations. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Scalable
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism that leverages two scaling factors to release
dimensions of query, key, and value matrices while unbinding them with the
input. This scalability fetches context-oriented generalization and enhances
object sensitivity, which pushes the whole network into a more effective
trade-off state between accuracy and cost. Furthermore, we propose an
Interactive Window-based Self-Attention (IWSA), which establishes interaction
between non-overlapping regions by re-merging independent value tokens and
aggregating spatial information from adjacent windows. By stacking the SSA and
IWSA alternately, the Scalable Vision Transformer (ScalableViT) achieves
state-of-the-art performance in general-purpose vision tasks. For example,
ScalableViT-S outperforms Twins-SVT-S by 1.4% and Swin-T by 1.8% on ImageNet-1K

keyword-based routing algorithms in unstructured networks. Specifically, as the
first in the field, this paper investigates routing table designs and various

discovery routing. Novel summarization algorithms, including alphabetical,

without degrading lookup efficiency for discovery query routing. The issue of
potentially misleading routing due to summarization is also investigated.
Subsequently, we analyze the strategy of when to summarize to balance the
tradeoff between the routing table compression rate and the chance of causing
misleading routing. For the experimental study, we have collected 100K IoT data
streams from various IoT databases as the input dataset. Experimental results
show that our summarization solution can reduce the routing table size by 20 to

evidence of an Io-DAM arc associated with a trans-hemispheric beam UV spot.
Multi-point radio observations probe the Io-DAM sources at various altitudes,
times and hemispheres. Overall, $\theta$ varies a function of frequency
(altitude), by decreasing from $75^\circ-80^\circ$ to $70^\circ-75^\circ$ over
$10-40$ MHz with slightly larger values in the northern hemisphere, and
independently varies as a function of time (or longitude of Io). Its
uncertainty of a few degrees is dominated by the error on the longitude of the

been recently adopted, as they can effectively exploit the domain knowledge,
i.e., the graph topology in wireless communications problems. GNN-based methods
can achieve near-optimal performance in large-scale networks and generalize
well under different system settings, but the theoretical underpinnings and
design guidelines remain elusive, which may hinder their practical
implementations. This paper endeavors to fill both the theoretical and
practical gaps. For theoretical guarantees, we prove that GNNs achieve
near-optimal performance in wireless networks with much fewer training samples

However, the immense diversity of the OOD examples makes such methods fragile.
There are OOD samples that are easy to identify in the feature space while hard
to distinguish in the logit space and vice versa. Motivated by this
observation, we propose a novel OOD scoring method named Virtual-logit Matching

various fields such as manufacturing, medical care, and intelligent

anomaly detection because they can easily learn normal patterns in an
unsupervised learning environment and calculate a score to identify
abnormalities through a reconstruction error indicating the difference between
input and reconstructed images. Therefore, current image anomaly detection
methods have commonly used convolutional encoder-decoders to extract normal
information through the local features of images. However, they are limited in
that only local features of the image can be utilized when constructing a
normal representation owing to the characteristics of convolution operations
using a filter of fixed size. Therefore, we propose a vision transformer-based
encoder-decoder model, named AnoViT, designed to reflect normal information by
additionally learning the global relationship between image patches, which is
capable of both image anomaly detection and localization. The proposed approach
constructs a feature map that maintains the existing location information of
individual patches by using the embeddings of all patches passed through
multiple self-attention layers. The proposed AnoViT model performed better than
the convolution-based model on three benchmark datasets. In MVTecAD, which is a
representative benchmark dataset for anomaly localization, it showed improved
results on 10 out of 15 classes compared with the baseline. Furthermore, the
proposed method showed good performance regardless of the class and type of the
anomalous area when localization results were evaluated qualitatively.

system constituted of a degenerate diffusion-growth-fragmentation equation and
a differential equation, resulting from the modeling of bacterial growth in a
chemostat. This system is derived, in a large population approximation, from a
stochastic individual-based model where each individual is characterized by a
non-negative real valued trait described by a diffusion. Two uniqueness results
are highlighted. They differ in their hypotheses related to the influence of
the resource on individual trait dynamics, the main difficulty being the
non-linearity due to this dependence and the degeneracy of the diffusion
coefficient. Further we show that the semi-group of the stochastic trait
dynamics admits a density by probabilistic arguments, that allows the measure
solution of the diffusiongrowth-fragmentation equation to be a function with a
certain Besov regularity.

both, which processing strategy out of several alternatives is used and how
this strategy is implemented in neural dynamics. A prime example are studies on
predictive coding. These often ask if confirmed predictions about inputs or
predictions errors between internal predictions and inputs are passed on in a
hierarchical neural system--while at the same time looking for the neural
correlates of coding for errors and predictions. If we do not know exactly what
a neural system predicts at any given moment, this results in a circular
analysis--as has been criticized correctly. To circumvent such circular
analysis, we propose to express information processing strategies (such as
predictive coding) by local information-theoretic quantities, such that they
can be estimated directly from neural data. We demonstrate our approach by
investigating two opposing accounts of predictive coding-like processing
strategies, where we quantify the building blocks of predictive coding, namely
predictability of inputs and transfer of information, by local active
information storage and local transfer entropy. We define testable hypotheses
on the relationship of both quantities to identify which of the assumed
strategies was used. We demonstrate our approach on spiking data from the
retinogeniculate synapse of the cat. Applying our local information dynamics
framework, we are able to show that the synapse codes for predictable rather
than surprising input. To support our findings, we apply measures from partial
information decomposition, which allow to differentiate if the transferred
information is primarily bottom-up sensory input or information transferred
conditionally on the current state of the synapse. Supporting our local
information-theoretic results, we find that the synapse preferentially
transfers bottom-up information.

over-parameterized single image super-resolution (SISR) models. Our ARM is
motivated by three observations: (1) The performance of different image patches
varies with SISR networks of different sizes. (2) There is a tradeoff between
computation overhead and performance of the reconstructed image. (3) Given an
input image, its edge information can be an effective option to estimate its
PSNR. Subsequently, we train an ARM supernet containing SISR subnets of
different sizes to deal with image patches of various complexity. To that
effect, we construct an Edge-to-PSNR lookup table that maps the edge score of
an image patch to the PSNR performance for each subnet, together with a set of
computation costs for the subnets. In the inference, the image patches are
individually distributed to different subnets for a better
computation-performance tradeoff. Moreover, each SISR subnet shares weights of
the ARM supernet, thus no extra parameters are introduced. The setting of
multiple subnets can well adapt the computational cost of SISR model to the
dynamically available hardware resources, allowing the SISR task to be in
service at any time. Extensive experiments on resolution datasets of different
sizes with popular SISR networks as backbones verify the effectiveness and the
versatility of our ARM. The source code is available at

  pointing","Accepted by PRD",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.105.082003",,"physics.ins-det hep-ex quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Frequency dependent squeezing is the main upgrade for achieving broadband
quantum noise reduction in upcoming observation runs of gravitational wave
detectors. The proper frequency dependence of the squeezed quadrature is
obtained by reflecting squeezed vacuum from a Fabry-Perot filter cavity detuned
by half of its linewidth. However, since the squeezed vacuum contains no
classical amplitude, co-propagating auxiliary control beams are required to
achieve the filter cavity's length, alignment, and incident beam pointing
stability. In our frequency dependent squeezing experiment at the National
Astronomical Observatory of Japan, we used a control beam at a harmonic of
squeezed vacuum wavelength and found visible detuning variation related to the
suspended mirrors angular drift. These variations can degrade interferometer
quantum noise reduction. We investigated various mechanisms that can cause the
filter cavity detuning variation. The detuning drift is found to be mitigated
sufficiently by fixing the incident beam pointing and applying filter cavity
automatic alignment. It was also found that there is an optimal position of the
beam on the filter cavity mirror that helps to reduce the detuning
fluctuations. Here we report a stabilized filter cavity detuning variation of
less than 10$\,$Hz compared to the 113$\,$Hz cavity linewidth. Compared to
previously published results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 171101 (2020)], such
detuning stability would be sufficient to make filter cavity detuning drift
induced gravitational wave detector detection range fluctuation reduce from
$11\%$ to within $2\%$.

A desired approach is to flexibly accommodate waypoint specifications, planning

topological, and metric levels, each capturing different aspects of the

This approach provides a novel integrated probabilistic generative model and
fast approximate inference, with interaction among the hierarchy levels. A
formulation based on control as probabilistic inference theoretically supports
the proposed path planning. Navigation experiments using speech instruction
with a waypoint demonstrated the performance improvement of path planning,
WN-SPL by 0.589, and reduced computation time by 7.14 sec compared to
conventional methods. Hierarchical spatial representations offer a mutually

that this implies unitarity of the S-matrix. We establish a CFT dispersion

positivity of the OPE establishes that any such S-matrix must satisfy extended

S-matrix may be more directly described by a phase shift formula. Our results
crucially depend on the assumption of a certain gap in the spectrum of

find that the presence of anomalous thresholds in S-matrices are precisely
signaled by an unbounded OPE arising from violating this assumption. Finally we
clarify the relation between unitarity saturating S-matrices and extremal CFTs,

remain rare. Strikingly, while electrons are expected to be accelerated in the
bow shock and their non-thermal emission may include synchrotron emission at
low frequencies, only two massive runaway stellar bow shocks have to date been
detected in the radio band. Here, we examine a sample of fifty IR-detected bow
shocks from the E-BOSS catalogues in recently released radio images from the

likely counterparts, as well as three inconclusive candidates requiring

reinforcement learning (RL) with deep neural networks. However, the issue of
high sample complexity persists in applications of ES to deep RL over long
horizons. This paper is the first to address the shortcoming of today's methods
via a novel neuroevolutionary multitasking (NuEMT) algorithm, designed to
transfer information from a set of auxiliary tasks (of short episode length) to
the target (full length) RL task at hand. The auxiliary tasks, extracted from
the target, allow an agent to update and quickly evaluate policies on shorter
time horizons. The evolved skills are then transferred to guide the longer and
harder task towards an optimal policy. We demonstrate that the NuEMT algorithm
achieves data-efficient evolutionary RL, reducing expensive agent-environment
interaction data requirements. Our key algorithmic contribution in this setting
is to introduce, for the first time, a multitask skills transfer mechanism
based on the statistical importance sampling technique. In addition, an
adaptive resource allocation strategy is utilized to assign computational
resources to auxiliary tasks based on their gleaned usefulness. Experiments on
a range of continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym confirm that our

effective alternative to traditional model-predictive control (MPC) for its
unique features of being time-efficient and unbiased with respect to the oracle
solution. Nonetheless, it has also been observed that noise may strongly
jeopardize the final closed-loop performance since it affects both the
data-based system representation and the control update computed from the
online measurements. Recent studies have shown that regularization is
potentially a successful tool to counteract the effect of noise. At the same
time, regularization requires the tuning of a set of penalty terms, whose
choice might be practically difficult without closed-loop experiments. In this
paper, by means of subspace identification tools, we pursue a three-fold goal:
$(i)$ we set up a unified framework for the existing regularized data-driven
predictive control schemes for stochastic systems; $(ii)$ we introduce
$\gamma$-DDPC, an efficient two-stage scheme that splits the optimization
problem into two parts: fitting the initial conditions and optimizing the
future performance, while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction; $(iii)$ we
discuss the role of regularization for data-driven predictive control,
providing new insight on $when$ and $how$ it should be applied. A benchmark
numerical case study finally illustrates the performance of $\gamma$-DDPC,
showing how controller design can be simplified in terms of tuning effort and

soon be detected via the redshifted 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen, allowing
us to indirectly study the properties of HMXBs in the unseen, first galaxies.
Low-redshift observations, as well as theoretical models, imply that the
integrated X-ray luminosity to star formation rate of HMXBs ($L_{\rm X}/{\rm
SFR}$) should increase in metal-poor environments, typical of early galaxies.
Here we study the impact of the metallicity ($Z$) dependence of $L_{\rm X}/{\rm

rates of order $10^{-3} - 10^{-1}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and metallicities of
order $10^{-3} - 10^{-2}$ $Z_\odot$ are the dominant contributors to the X-ray
background (XRB) during this period. Different $L_{\rm X}/{\rm SFR}$-$Z$
relations result in factors of $\sim$ 3 differences in these ranges, as well as
in the mean IGM temperature and the large-scale 21-cm power, at a given

constant $L_{\rm X}/{\rm SFR}$ models over-predict the XRB and its relative
contribution to the early stages of the reionization.

brain network features derived from MRI. Convolutions neural networks show
reasonable performance in predicting IDH mutation, which, however, cannot learn
from non-Euclidean data, e.g., geometric and network data. In this study, we
propose a multi-modal learning framework using three separate encoders to
extract features of focal tumor image, tumor geometrics and global brain

self-supervised approach to generate brain networks from anatomical
multi-sequence MRI. Moreover, to extract tumor-related features from the brain
network, we design a hierarchical attention module for the brain network
encoder. Further, we design a bi-level multi-modal contrastive loss to align
the multi-modal features and tackle the domain gap at the focal tumor and
global brain. Finally, we propose a weighted population graph to integrate the
multi-modal features for genotype prediction. Experimental results on the
testing set show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline deep learning
models. The ablation experiments validate the performance of different
components of the framework. The visualized interpretation corresponds to
clinical knowledge with further validation. In conclusion, the proposed

of depth completion methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue. While
most existing methods can generate accurate dense depth maps from sparse and
uniformly sampled depth maps, they are not suitable for complementing the large
contiguous regions of missing depth values, which is common and critical. In
this paper, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network, which takes
a pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to predict a dense and
completed depth map. The first branch employs an encoder-decoder structure to
regress the local dense depth values from the raw depth map, with the help of
local guidance information extracted from the RGB image. In the other branch,
we propose an RGB-depth fusion GAN to transfer the RGB image to the
fine-grained textured depth map. We adopt adaptive fusion modules named W-AdaIN
to propagate the features across the two branches, and we append a confidence
fusion head to fuse the two outputs of the branches for the final depth map.
Extensive experiments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate that our
proposed method clearly improves the depth completion performance, especially
in a more realistic setting of indoor environments with the help of the pseudo

labels, i.e., noisy labels, which may confuse model training and lead to
performance degradation. To overcome this issue, Label Noise Learning (LNL) has
recently attracted much attention, and various methods have been proposed to
design an unbiased risk estimator to the noise-free dataset to combat such
label noise. Among them, a trend of works based on Loss Decomposition and
Centroid Estimation (LDCE) has shown very promising performance. However,
existing LNL methods based on LDCE are only designed for binary classification,
and they are not directly extendable to multi-class situations. In this paper,
we propose a novel multi-class robust learning method for LDCE, which is termed
""MC-LDCE"". Specifically, we decompose the commonly adopted loss (e.g., mean
squared loss) function into a label-dependent part and a label-independent
part, in which only the former is influenced by label noise. Further, by
defining a new form of data centroid, we transform the recovery problem of a
label-dependent part to a centroid estimation problem. Finally, by critically
examining the mathematical expectation of clean data centroid given the
observed noisy set, the centroid can be estimated which helps to build an
unbiased risk estimator for multi-class learning. The proposed MC-LDCE method
is general and applicable to different types (i.e., linear and nonlinear) of
classification models. The experimental results on five public datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MC-LDCE against other
representative LNL methods in tackling multi-class label noise problem.

the notion of modular class to the realm of singular foliations. The
singularities are dealt with by replacing the singular foliations by any of
their universal Lie $\infty$-algebroids, and by picking up the modular class of
the latter. The geometric meaning of the modular class of a singular foliation

the uniform boundedness of the discrete solution is shown by carefully
exploiting the structure of the system. Uniform estimates and passage to the

relations, erodes trust in institutions, and thus threatens democratic
societies. Academic efforts to understand this phenomenon have traditionally
approached it from a one-dimensional perspective, focusing on bipolar or
dichotomous systems. However, political conflicts often involve not only two,
but multiple potentially dissenting factions. The most representative examples
are multi-party democracies, where the multilateral tensions among different
parties often lead to gridlock and uncertainty. Despite the prevalence of these
multipolar systems, there is still a lack of suitable analytical tools to study
their intricate polarization patterns. In this work, we develop an analytical
framework consisting of an inherently multipolar model for unbiased ideological
spaces, a method to infer multidimensional opinions from interaction networks,
and novel multidimensional polarization metrics that quantify several aspects
of ideological polarization and bring new insights into the analysis of
high-dimensional opinion distributions. Crucially, our multidimensional
framework does not assume the underlying ideological structure, such as
conservative vs progressive, liberal vs authoritarian, etc. Instead, it reveals
the natural space that best describes the social landscape, which does not
necessarily correspond to traditional categories. We illustrate the application
of this framework in quadripolar and pentapolar real-world democratic
processes, finding non-trivial ideological structures with clear connections to
the underlying social context. Our methodology offers a comprehensive
perspective of multilateral social tensions, as it incorporates complementary
aspects of polarization: network segregation, opinion extremeness, and issue
alignment.

with photon-energy below the A-exciton of MoS2 monolayer, hot electrons
transfer from graphene to MoS2 takes place in time scale of less than 0.5 ps,
resulting in ultrafast formation of interfacial exciton in the heterostructure,
subsequently, recombination relaxation of the interfacial exciton occurs in
time scale of ~18 ps. A new model considering carrier heating and photogating
effect in graphene is proposed to estimate the amount of carrier transfer in
the heterostructure, which shows a good agreement with experimental result.
Moreover, when the photon-energy is on-resonance with the A-exciton of MoS2,
photogenerated holes in MoS2 are transferred to graphene layer within 0.5 ps,
leading to the formation of interfacial exciton, the subsequent
photoconductivity (PC) relaxation of graphene and bleaching recovery of
A-exciton in MoS2 take place around ~10 ps time scale, ascribing to the
interfacial exciton recombination. The faster recombination time of interfacial
exciton with on-resonance excitation could come from the reduced interface
barrier caused by bandgap renormalization effect. Our study provides deep
insight into the understanding of interfacial charge transfer as well as the
relaxation dynamics in graphene-based heterostructures, which are promising for
the applications of graphene-based optoelectronic devices.

bending of the star-forming main sequence (MS) occurs over 0<z<4. We find
M0~10^10Msun over 0<z<1, then M0 rises up to ~10^11Msun at z=2, and then stays
flat or slowly increases towards higher redshifts. When converting M0 values
into hosting dark matter halo masses, we show that this behaviour is remarkably
consistent with the evolving cold- to hot-accretion transition mass, as
predicted by theory and defined by the redshift-independent Mshock at z<1.4 and
by the rising Mstream at z>1.4 (for which we propose a revision in agreement
with latest simulations). We hence argue that the MS bending is primarily due
to the lessening of cold-accretion causing a reduction in available cold gas in
galaxies and supports predictions of gas feeding theory. In particular, the
rapidly rising M0 with redshift at z>1 is confirming evidence for the
cold-streams scenario. In this picture, a progressive fueling reduction rather
than its sudden suppression in halos more massive than Mshock/Mstream produces
a nearly constant star-formation rate in galaxies with stellar masses larger
than M0, and not their quenching, for which other physical processes are thus
required. Compared to the knee M* in the stellar mass function of galaxies, M0
is significantly lower at z<1.5, and higher at z>2, suggesting that the imprint
of gas deprivation on the distribution of galaxy masses happened at early times
(z>1.5-2). The typical mass at which galaxies inside the MS become
bulge-dominated evolves differently from M0, consistent with the idea that
bulge-formation is a distinct process from the phasing-out of cold-accretion.

They are promising to be large-scale adopted. For the sake of practicality, a
thorough investigation of the architecture design of learned image compression,

paper, we first propose uneven channel-conditional adaptive coding, motivated
by the observation of energy compaction in learned image compression. Combining
the proposed uneven grouping model with existing context models, we obtain a
spatial-channel contextual adaptive model to improve the coding performance
without damage to running speed. Then we study the structure of the main
transform and propose an efficient model, ELIC, to achieve state-of-the-art
speed and compression ability. With superior performance, the proposed model
also supports extremely fast preview decoding and progressive decoding, which
makes the coming application of learning-based image compression more
promising.

  Consistency Perspective","Accepted to CVPR2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite recent stereo matching networks achieving impressive performance
given sufficient training data, they suffer from domain shifts and generalize
poorly to unseen domains. We argue that maintaining feature consistency between
matching pixels is a vital factor for promoting the generalization capability
of stereo matching networks, which has not been adequately considered. Here we
address this issue by proposing a simple pixel-wise contrastive learning across
the viewpoints. The stereo contrastive feature loss function explicitly
constrains the consistency between learned features of matching pixel pairs
which are observations of the same 3D points. A stereo selective whitening loss
is further introduced to better preserve the stereo feature consistency across
domains, which decorrelates stereo features from stereo viewpoint-specific
style information. Counter-intuitively, the generalization of feature
consistency between two viewpoints in the same scene translates to the
generalization of stereo matching performance to unseen domains. Our method is
generic in nature as it can be easily embedded into existing stereo networks
and does not require access to the samples in the target domain. When trained
on synthetic data and generalized to four real-world testing sets, our method
achieves superior performance over several state-of-the-art networks.

frequencies, often observed in the power spectrum of black holes, are useful in
understanding the nature of strong gravity since they are associated with the
motion of matter in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. Interestingly,
these high frequency QPOs (HFQPOs) are observed in commensurable pairs, the
most common ratio being 3:2. Several theoretical models are proposed in the
literature which explain the HFQPOs in terms of the orbital and epicyclic
frequencies of matter rotating around the central object. Since these
frequencies are sensitive to the background spacetime, the observed HFQPOs can
potentially extract useful information regarding the nature of the same. In
this work, we investigate the role of regular black holes with a Minkowski
core, which arise in gravity coupled to non-linear electrodynamics, in
explaining the HFQPOs. Regular black holes are particularly interesting as they
provide a possible resolution to the singularity problem in general relativity.
We compare the model dependent QPO frequencies with the available observations
of the quasi-periodic oscillations from black hole sources and perform a \c{hi}

values of the non-linear electrodynamics charge parameter. In particular, black
holes with large values of non-linear electrodynamics charge parameter are
generically disfavored by present observations related to QPOs.

leaf switches are enabled with OWC transceivers, and the spine switches are
replaced by Access Points (APs) in the ceiling connected to a backbone network.
The APs are interconnected through a Passive Optical Network (PON) that also
connects the architecture with upper network layers. An Infrared (IR) OWC
system that employs Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is proposed to
enhance the DCN downlink communication. The simulation (i.e., channel modeling)
results show that our proposed data center links achieve good data rates in the
data center up to 15 Gbps. For the PON, Arrayed Waveguide Grating Routers

Starting from accurate photometric redshifts we measure the near-infrared
selected two-point angular correlation and stellar mass functions in ten
redshift bins and fit them with an HOD-based model. At each redshift, we
measure the ratio of stellar mass to halo mass, $M_*/M_h$, which shows the
characteristic strong dependence of halo mass with a peak at $M_h^{\rm peak}
\sim 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$. Our results are in accordance with the scenario in
which the peak of star-formation efficiency moves towards more massive halos at
higher redshifts. We also measure the fraction of satellites as a function of
stellar mass and redshift. For all stellar mass thresholds the satellite
fraction decreases at higher redshifts. At a given redshift there is a higher
fraction of low-mass satellites. The satellite contribution to the total
stellar mass budget in halos becomes more important than centrals at halo
masses of about $M_h > 10^{13} \, M_{\odot}$ and always stays below by peak,
indicating that quenching mechanisms are present in massive halos that keep the
star-formation efficiency low. Finally, we compare our results with three
hydrodynamical simulations Horizon-AGN, Illustris-TNG-100 and EAGLE. We find
that the most significant discrepancy is at the high mass end, where the
simulations generally show that satellites have a higher contribution to the
total stellar mass budget than the observations. This, together with the
finding that the fraction of satellites is higher in the simulations, indicates
that the feedback mechanisms acting in group-and cluster-scale halos appear to
be less efficient in quenching the mass assembly of satellites, and/or that
quenching occurs much later in the simulations.

variable individually. However, we find inter-correlations and
intra-correlations exist when observing latent variables in a vectorized
perspective. These findings reveal visual redundancies to improve
rate-distortion performance and parallel processing ability to speed up
compression. This encourages us to propose a novel vectorized prior.
Specifically, a multivariate Gaussian mixture is proposed with means and
covariances to be estimated. Then, a novel probabilistic vector quantization is
utilized to effectively approximate means, and remaining covariances are
further induced to a unified mixture and solved by cascaded estimation without
context models involved. Furthermore, codebooks involved in quantization are
extended to multi-codebooks for complexity reduction, which formulates an
efficient compression procedure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets

the implications of some properties of technological life that fundamentally
differ from nontechnological life in the context of modern astrobiology: It can
spread among the stars to many sites, it can be more easily detected at large

illustration in terms of the Drake equation, we consider two Drake-like

the longevity term L and that its maximum value could be very large, in that
technology can outlive its creators and even its host star. We conclude that
while the Drake equation implies that N(bio)>>N(tech), it is also plausible
that N(tech)>>N(bio). As a consequence, as we seek possible indicators of
extraterrestrial life, for instance, via characterization of the atmospheres of

solving environments with sparse rewards remains a challenging task that
requires sophisticated exploration. Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) remedies
this issue by guiding the agent's exploration towards states experienced by an
expert. Naturally, the benefits of this approach hinge on the quality of
demonstrations, which are rarely optimal in realistic scenarios. Modern LfD
algorithms require meticulous tuning of hyperparameters that control the
influence of demonstrations and, as we show in the paper, struggle with
learning from suboptimal demonstrations. To address these issues, we extend
Self-Imitation Learning (SIL), a recent RL algorithm that exploits the agent's
past good experience, to the LfD setup by initializing its replay buffer with
demonstrations. We denote our algorithm as SIL from Demonstrations (SILfD). We
empirically show that SILfD can learn from demonstrations that are noisy or far
from optimal and can automatically adjust the influence of demonstrations
throughout the training without additional hyperparameters or handcrafted
schedules. We also find SILfD superior to the existing state-of-the-art LfD
algorithms in sparse environments, especially when demonstrations are highly
suboptimal.

Larmour radii) filaments are observed. These divertor-localised filaments
appear born radially at the position of maximum density and display a radially
outward motion with velocity $\approx$400\,m/s that is comparable to radial
velocities of upstream-connected filaments. Conversely, in these discharges

poloidal velocities differ strongly from those of upstream-connected filaments.

converges to its long-time limiting scaling form. Moreover, we discuss the
properties of the mean squared displacement (MSD) of a particle diffusing on
the infinite cluster at criticality. This one is known not to be
self-averaging. We show that the fluctuations of the MSD in different
realizations of the cluster are universal, and discuss the properties of the
distribution of these fluctuations. These strong fluctuations coexist with the
ergodicity of subdiffusive behavior in the time domain. The dependence of the
relative strength of fluctuations in time-averaged MSD on the total trajectory
length (total simulation time) is characteristic for diffusion in a percolation
system and can be used as an additional test to distinguish this process with
disorder-induced memory from processes with otherwise similar behavior, like
fractional Brownian motion with the same value of the Hurst exponent.

recently. In spite of recent efforts in this field, how to learn accurate scene
depths and alleviate the negative influence of occlusions for self-supervised
depth estimation, still remains an open problem. Addressing this problem, we
firstly empirically analyze the effects of both the continuous and discrete
depth constraints which are widely used in the training process of many
existing works. Then inspired by the above empirical analysis, we propose a
novel network to learn an Occlusion-aware Coarse-to-Fine Depth map for
self-supervised monocular depth estimation, called OCFD-Net. Given an arbitrary
training set of stereo image pairs, the proposed OCFD-Net does not only employ
a discrete depth constraint for learning a coarse-level depth map, but also
employ a continuous depth constraint for learning a scene depth residual,
resulting in a fine-level depth map. In addition, an occlusion-aware module is
designed under the proposed OCFD-Net, which is able to improve the capability
of the learnt fine-level depth map for handling occlusions. Experimental
results on KITTI demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
comparative state-of-the-art methods under seven commonly used metrics in most

effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the cross-dataset

relevant to both high-energy particle physics and low-energy condensed matter
physics with the rapid development of engineered quantum devices providing new
tools to study e.g. dynamics of such theories. The massive Schwinger model is
known to exhibit intricate properties of more complicated theories and has
recently been shown to undergo dynamical quantum phase transitions out of
equilibrium. With current technology, noise is inevitable and potentially fatal
for a successful quantum simulation. This paper studies the dynamics subject to
noise of a $(1+1)$D U$(1)$ quantum link model following a quench of the sign of
the mass term. We find that not only is the system capable of handling noise at
rates realistic in NISQ-era devices, promising the possiblity to study the
target dynamics with current technology, but the effect of noise can be
understood in terms of simple models. Specifically the gauge-breaking nature of
bit-flip channels results in exponential dampening of state amplitudes, and
thus observables, which does not affect the structures of interest. This is
especially important as it demonstrates that the gauge theory can be
successfully studied with devices that only exhibit approximate gauge
invariance.

has to be taken into account in the timing model is the propagation delay of
the pulses in the gravitational field of the black hole. Due to the extreme
mass ratio of the pulsar and the supermassive back hole we use the test
particle limit to derive an exact analytical formula for the propagation delay

which the frame dragging effect is expected to be maximal. We compare our
formula for the propagation time delay with Post-Newtonian approaches, and in

system, possessing zero net magnetization. Common wisdom suggests that for such
a system, a spin-polarized current is no longer available from a beam of
unpolarized electrons. But, once we apply an electric field perpendicular to
the helix axis, a large separation between up and down spin energy channels
takes place which yields a high degree of spin polarization. Such a
prescription has not been reported so far to the best of our concern. Employing
a tight-binding framework to illustrate the antiferromagnetic helix, we compute
spin filtration efficiency by determining spin selective currents using
Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism. Geometrical conformation plays an important
role in spin channel separation, and here we critically investigate the effects
of short-range and long-range hoppings of electrons in presence of the electric
field. We find that the filtration performance gets improved with increasing
the range of hopping of electrons. Moreover, the phase of spin polarization can
be altered selectively by changing the strength and direction of the electric
field, and also by regulating the physical parameters that describe the
antiferromagnetic helix. Finally, we explore the specific role of dephasing, to
make the system more realistic and to make the present communication a
self-contained one. Our analysis may provide a new route of getting
conformation-dependent spin polarization possessing longer range hopping of

and efficient trajectories is a long-standing challenge. Several approaches
have been considered, roughly falling under two categories: rule-based and

and feasibility, fall short when it comes to long-term planning and
generalization. The learning-based approaches are able to account for long-term
planning and generalization to unseen situations, but may fail to achieve

approach, which learns target trajectory parameters for fully autonomous
driving on highways. The trained agent outputs continuous trajectory parameters
based on which a feasible polynomial-based trajectory is generated and

Answer (SQA) website with millions of programming-related questions and
answers. Tags play a critical role in efficiently structuring the contents in
Stack Overflow and are vital to support a range of site operations, e.g.,
querying relevant contents. Poorly selected tags often introduce extra noise
and redundancy, which leads to tag synonym and tag explosion problems. Thus, an
automated tag recommendation technique that can accurately recommend
high-quality tags is desired to alleviate the problems mentioned above.
Inspired by the recent success of pre-trained language models (PTMs) in natural
language processing (NLP), we present PTM4Tag, a tag recommendation framework
for Stack Overflow posts that utilize PTMs with a triplet architecture, which
models the components of a post, i.e., Title, Description, and Code with
independent language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that leverages PTMs in the tag recommendation task of SQA sites. We
comparatively evaluate the performance of PTM4Tag based on five popular
pre-trained models: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, CodeBERT, and BERTOverflow. Our
results show that leveraging the software engineering (SE) domain-specific PTM
CodeBERT in PTM4Tag achieves the best performance among the five considered
PTMs and outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning (Convolutional Neural
Network-based) approach by a large margin in terms of average $Precision@k$,
$Recall@k$, and $F1$-$score@k$. We conduct an ablation study to quantify the
contribution of a post's constituent components (Title, Description, and Code
Snippets) to the performance of PTM4Tag. Our results show that Title is the
most important in predicting the most relevant tags, and utilizing all the
components achieves the best performance.

large-scale decision-making in recent years. The existing popular models, like
causal forest (CF), are limited to either discrete treatments or posing
parametric assumptions on the outcome-treatment relationship that may suffer

Moreover, we propose a generic distance-based splitting criterion to capture
the heterogeneity for the continuous treatments. We call the proposed algorithm
generalized causal forest (GCF) as it generalizes the use case of CF to a much
broader setting. We show the effectiveness of GCF by deriving the asymptotic

thus ignoring topological errors and anatomical inconsistencies. We address
this limitation by moving from pixel-level to graph representations, which
allow to naturally incorporate anatomical constraints by construction. To this
end, we introduce HybridGNet, an encoder-decoder neural architecture that
leverages standard convolutions for image feature encoding and graph
convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) to decode plausible representations of
anatomical structures. We also propose a novel image-to-graph skip connection
layer which allows localized features to flow from standard convolutional

proposed architecture is extensively evaluated in a variety of domain shift and
image occlusion scenarios, and audited considering different types of

colors using a simple greedy algorithm. Remarkably, recent work has shown that
one can find such a coloring even in the semi-streaming model. But, in reality,
one almost never needs $(\Delta+1)$ colors to properly color a graph. Indeed,
the celebrated \Brooks' theorem states that every (connected) graph beside
cliques and odd cycles can be colored with $\Delta$ colors. Can we find a
$\Delta$-coloring in the semi-streaming model as well?
  We settle this key question in the affirmative by designing a randomized
semi-streaming algorithm that given any graph, with high probability, either
correctly declares that the graph is not $\Delta$-colorable or outputs a
$\Delta$-coloring of the graph.
  The proof of this result starts with a detour. We first (provably) identify
the extent to which the previous approaches for streaming coloring fail for
$\Delta$-coloring: for instance, all these approaches can handle streams with
repeated edges and they can run in $o(n^2)$ time -- we prove that neither of
these tasks is possible for $\Delta$-coloring. These impossibility results
however pinpoint exactly what is missing from prior approaches when it comes to
$\Delta$-coloring.
  We then build on these insights to design a semi-streaming algorithm that
uses $(i)$ a novel sparse-recovery approach based on sparse-dense
decompositions to (partially) recover the ""problematic"" subgraphs of the input
-- the ones that form the basis of our impossibility results -- and $(ii)$ a
new coloring approach for these subgraphs that allows for recoloring of other
vertices in a controlled way without relying on local explorations or finding
""augmenting paths"" that are generally impossible for semi-streaming algorithms.
We believe both these techniques can be of independent interest.

involving multiple users. By sending less data over the network and
interpolating the in-between frames locally, we manage to obtain better visual
results than current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we prove that, for
recording purposes, storing less data and interpolating them on-demand yields a

many-dimensional probability distributions that appear e.g. in lattice field
theories or statistical mechanics. Subsequently they can be used as variational
approximators to asses extensive properties of statistical systems, like free
energy, and also as neural samplers used in Monte Carlo simulations. The
practical application of this approach is unfortunately limited by its
unfavorable scaling both of the numerical cost required for training, and the
memory requirements with the system size. This is due to the fact that the
original proposition involved a neural network of width which scaled with the
total number of degrees of freedom, e.g. $L^2$ in case of a two dimensional
$L\times L$ lattice. In this work we propose a hierarchical association of
physical degrees of freedom, for instance spins, to neurons which replaces it
with the scaling with the linear extent $L$ of the system. We demonstrate our
approach on the two-dimensional Ising model by simulating lattices of various
sizes up to $128 \times 128$ spins, with time benchmarks reaching lattices of
size $512 \times 512$. We observe that our proposal improves the quality of
neural network training, i.e. the approximated probability distribution is
closer to the target that could be previously achieved. As a consequence, the
variational free energy reaches a value closer to its theoretical expectation
and, if applied in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the resulting
autocorrelation time is smaller. Finally, the replacement of a single neural
network by a hierarchy of smaller networks considerably reduces the memory
requirements.

We examine how this method can be used also for activations and their gradients

optimality criteria. Previous works aimed to minimize the mean-square-error

fine for pruning the activations, it catastrophically fails for the neural
gradients. Instead, we show that optimal pruning of the neural gradients
requires an unbiased minimum-variance pruning mask. We design such specialized
masks, and find that in most cases, 1:2 sparsity is sufficient for training,
and 2:4 sparsity is usually enough when this is not the case. Further, we
suggest combining several such methods together in order to potentially speed

stable under temperature gradient from 250{\deg}C to room temperature with no

strongly depends on the angle of incidence, the polarization of the

exerted on a dielectric or a chiral slab due to the two incident plane waves,
is constant over the slab for normal incidence, and it varies locally for an
oblique incidence, which indeed follows the conservation laws at all incident
angles. It is expected that the results may find fruitful applications in

states that it is possible to quantify ergonomically professional tasks using

be delegated to a collaborative robot. The second hypothesis is that by
including gesture recognition and spatial adaptation, the ergonomics of an HRC
scenario can be improved by avoiding needless motions that could expose
operators to ergonomic risks and by lowering the physical effort required of
operators. An HRC scenario for a television manufacturing process is optimized
to test both hypotheses. For the ergonomic evaluation, motion primitives with
known ergonomic risks were modeled for their detection in professional tasks
and to estimate a risk score based on the European Assembly Worksheet (EAWS). A
Deep Learning gesture recognition module trained with egocentric television
assembly data was used to complement the collaboration between the human
operator and the robot. Additionally, a skeleton-tracking algorithm provided
the robot with information about the operator's pose, allowing it to spatially
adapt its motion to the operator's anthropometrics. Three experiments were
conducted to determine the effect of gesture recognition and spatial adaptation
on the operator's range of motion. The rate of spatial adaptation was used as a
key performance indicator (KPI), and a new KPI for measuring the reduction in
the operator's motion is presented in this paper.

recently become possible as a result of increased availability of computational

physical interpretation of the results often remains challenging. Here, we
focus on direct inference of governing differential equations from data, which
can be formulated as a linear inverse problem. A Bayesian framework with a
Laplacian prior distribution is employed for finding sparse solutions
efficiently. The superior accuracy and robustness of the method is demonstrated
for various cases, including ordinary, partial, and stochastic differential
equations. Furthermore, we develop an active learning procedure for the
automated discovery of stochastic differential equations. In this procedure,
learning of the unknown dynamical equations is coupled to the application of
perturbations to the measured system in a feedback loop. We demonstrate with
simulations that the active learning procedure improves the inference of
empirical, Langevin-type descriptions of stochastic processes.

expected, for five higher inclination ($i \gtrsim 75^{\circ}$) systems, the
model fits are improved with the inclusion of a cold absorbing slab (an iron

Modeling of the metal lines in the HST spectra reveals that 7 of the 10 systems

turbulence and mixing. We use the Rortex--Shear decomposition of the vorticity
field into a pure rotational part (the rortex vector), and a non-rotational
part (the shear vector). We describe the morphology of ubiquitous hairpin-like
vortical structures (revealed by the rortex), similar to those commonly
observed in boundary-layer turbulence. These are born as relatively weak
vortices around the strong three-dimensional shearing structures of confined
Holmboe waves, and gradually strengthen and deform under increasing turbulence,
transforming into pairs of upward- and downward-pointing hairpins propagating
in opposite directions on the top and bottom edge of the shear layer. Each
hairpin's pair of legs are counter-rotating and entrain fluid laterally and
vertically, and their arched-up `heads', which are transverse vortices, entrain
fluid vertically. We then elucidate how this large-scale vortex morphology
stirs and mixes the density field. Essentially, vortices located at the sharp
density interface on either edge of the mixing layer (mostly hairpin heads)
engulf blobs of unmixed fluid into the mixing layer, while vortices inside the
mixing layer (mostly hairpin legs) further stir it, generating strong,
small-scale shear, enhancing mixing. These findings provide new insights into

half-convolutions. DCGMM sampling and inference are realized by a deep chain of

foot or horseback, and the historical map and troop numbers are available.
Compared to a discrete agent model, the flow model was found to better capture
the interaction of the forces with the terrain and each other. A brigade-level

The main source of asymmetry in the numbers of casualties was found to be the
inability of the Confederate forces to use effective ranged fire while they
were moving. Comparison of simulations with and without terrain effects showed
that they slow the pace of battle and favor the defenders, exposing the
attackers to heavy ranged fire for an extended period. A statistical analysis
of possible outcomes for an ensemble of 1000 randomized perturbations of the

events, it was found that only 6 percent of the scenarios resulted in an

Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in half-space with Neumann boundary conditions at
the origin, as well as for the log-gamma polymer model in a half-space. The
stationary measures are stochastic processes that depend on the boundary
condition as well as a parameter related to the drift at infinity. They are
expressed in terms of exponential functions of Brownian motions and gamma
random walks. We conjecture that these constitute all extremal stationary
measures for these models. The log-gamma polymer result is proved through a
symmetry argument related to half-space Whittaker processes which we expect may
be applicable to other integrable models. The KPZ result comes as an
intermediate disorder limit of the log-gamma polymer result and confirms the
conjectural description of these stationary measures from arXiv:2105.15178. To
prove the intermediate disorder limit, we provide a general half-space polymer

chemotherapy, and, more recently, immunotherapy. These modalities are often
combined to improve the therapeutic index. The general concept of radiation
therapy is to increase the therapeutic index by creating a physical dose
differential between tumors and normal tissues through precision dose
targeting, image guidance, and high radiation beams that deliver radiation dose
with high conformality, e.g., protons and ions. However, treatment and cure are
still limited by normal tissue radiation toxicity, with many patients
experiencing acute and long-term side effects. Recently, however, a
fundamentally different paradigm for increasing the therapeutic index of
radiation therapy has emerged, supported by preclinical research, and based on
the FLASH radiation effect. FLASH radiation therapy (FLASH-RT) is an ultra-high
dose-rate delivery of a therapeutic radiation dose within a fraction of a
second. Experimental studies have shown that normal tissues seem to be
universally spared at these high dose rates, whereas tumors are not. The dose
delivery conditions are not yet fully characterized. Still, it is currently
estimated that large doses of 10 Gy or more delivered in 200 ms or less produce
normal tissue sparing effects yet effectively kill tumor cells. There is a
great opportunity, but also many technical challenges, for the accelerator
community to create the required dose rates with novel and compact accelerators
to ensure the safe delivery of FLASH radiation beams.

Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory), we obtained an optical photometric sequence
of its optical counterpart. The light curve of the optical emission exhibits an
unusually steep rise ~100 s after the initial trigger. This behaviour is not
expected from a 'canonical' GRB optical afterglow. As an explanation, we
propose a scenario consisting of two superimposed flares: an optical flare
originating from the inner engine activity followed by the hydrodynamic peak of
an external shock. The inner-engine nature of the first pulse is supported by a
marginal detection of flux in hard X-rays. The second pulse eventually
concludes in a slow constant decay, which, as we show, follows the closure
relations for a slow cooling plasma expanding into the constant interstellar
medium and can be seen as an optical afterglow sensu stricto.

a rigorous parametric description of the phenomenon of intermittency in fully
developed turbulent flows. These quantities gather information about the most
""active"" part of a velocity field at each scale $\ell$, and allows one to
define a dimension function $p \to D_p$ that recovers intermittency correction
to the structure exponents $\zeta_p$ in an explicit way. In particular, the
predictions of the Frisch-Parisi multifractal formalism can be recovered in a
systematic and rigorous way.
  Within this framework we identify active regions that carry the most
energetic part of a velocity field at a given scale $\ell$. A threshold for
what constitutes to be active is defined explicitly. Active regions have proven
to be experimentally observable in our previous joint work \cite{Ph-paper}, and
shown to capture concentration of the energy cascade as $\ell \to 0$, in
\cite{CS2014}.
  We present several examples of fields which exhibit arbitrary multifractal
spectrum within theoretically permitted limitations. At the same time we
demonstrate with the use of a probabilistic argument that a random field is
expected to produce the classical K41 spectrum in the limit $\ell\to 0$.
Intermittent deviations from K41 theory are estimated at any finite scale also.
  Lastly, we present a detailed information-theoretic analysis of the
introduced objects. In particular, we quantify concentration of a given
source-field in terms of the volume factors, thresholds, and active regions.

solutions we consider have opposite signs in the lower and upper half of the
domain, this is a quasilinear forward-backward parabolic problem, which changes
type across a critical curved line within the domain. In particular, lateral
boundary conditions can be imposed only where the characteristics are inwards.
  There are several difficulties associated with this problem. First, the
forward-backward geometry depends on the solution itself. This requires to be
quite careful with the approximation procedure used to construct solutions.
Second, and more importantly, the linearized equations solved at each step of
the iterative scheme admit a finite number of singular solutions, of which we
provide an explicit construction. This is similar to well-known phenomena in
elliptic problems in nonsmooth domains. Hence, the solutions to the equation
are regular if and only if the source terms satisfy a finite number of
orthogonality conditions. A key difficulty of this work is to cope with these
orthogonality conditions during the nonlinear fixed-point scheme. In
particular, we are led to prove their stability with respect to the underlying
base flow.
  To tackle this deceivingly simple problem, we develop a methodology which we
believe to be both quite natural and adaptable to other situations in which one
wishes to prove the existence of regular solutions to a nonlinear problem for
suitable data despite the existence of singular solutions at the linear level.

on the UNIT simulation to simulate SDSS BOSS/eBOSS Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs)
within a wide redshift range of $0.2 < z < 1.0$. Besides the typical SHAM
scatter parameter $\sigma$, we include $v_{\rm smear}$ and $V_{\rm ceil}$ to
take into account the redshift uncertainty and the galaxy incompleteness
respectively. These two additional parameters are critical for reproducing the
observed 2PCF multipoles on 5--25$\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. The redshift
uncertainties obtained from the best-fitting $v_{\rm smear}$ agree with those
measured from repeat observations for all SDSS LRGs except for the LOWZ sample.
We explore several potential systematics but none of them can explain the
discrepancy found in LOWZ. Our explanation is that the LOWZ galaxies might
contain another type of galaxies which needs to be treated differently. The
evolution of the measured $\sigma$ and $V_{\rm ceil}$ also reveals that the
incompleteness of eBOSS galaxies decreases with the redshift. This is the
consequence of the magnitude lower limit applied in eBOSS LRG target selection.
Our SHAM also set upper limits for the intrinsic scatter of the galaxy--halo
relation given a complete galaxy sample: $\sigma_{\rm int}<0.31$ for LOWZ at
$0.2<z<0.33$, $\sigma_{\rm int}<0.36$ for LOWZ at $0.33<z<0.43$, and

phenomenon called concept drift. Different terms have been used in the
literature to refer to the same type of concept drift and the same term for
various types. This lack of unified terminology is set out to create confusion

start by grouping concept drift types by their mathematical definitions and
survey the different terms used in the literature to build a consolidated

drift detection methods proposed in the last decade. These methods utilize the
predictive model's performance degradation to signal substantial changes in the

time. We collect and reduce the available five sectors of short-cadence TESS
photometry of this star, as well as 672 legacy observations from six medium- to
high-resolution ground-based spectrographs. We determine the stellar pulsation
frequencies from both data sets using iterative prewhitening, do asymptotic g
mode modelling of the star and investigate the corresponding spectral line
profile variations using the pixel-by-pixel method. We validate the pulsation
frequencies from the TESS data up to $S/N \geq 5.6$, confirming recent reports
in the literature that the classical criterion $S/N \geq 4$ does not suffice
for space-based observations. We identify the pulsations as prograde dipole g
modes and r-mode pulsations, and measure a near-core rotation rate of $1.536(3)
d^{-1}$ and a buoyancy travel time $\Pi_0$ of 4190(50) s. These results are in
agreement with the observed spectral line profile variations, which were
qualitatively evaluated using a newly developed toy model. We establish a set
of conditions that have to be fulfilled for an asymptotic asteroseismic
analysis of g-mode pulsators. In the case of HD112429, two TESS sectors of
space photometry suffice. Although a detailed asteroseismic modelling analysis
is not viable for g-mode pulsators with only short or sparse light curves of
space photometry, we find that it is possible to determine global asteroseismic
quantities for a subset of these stars. (abbreviated.)

DenseSiam first maximizes the pixel level spatial consistency according to the
exact location correspondence in the overlapped area. It also extracts a batch

to be contrasted for region consistency. In contrast to previous methods that
require negative pixel pairs, momentum encoders or heuristic masks, DenseSiam
benefits from the simple Siamese network and optimizes the consistency of
different granularities. It also proves that the simple location correspondence
and interacted region embeddings are effective enough to learn the similarity.
We apply DenseSiam on ImageNet and obtain competitive improvements on various

studied using the maximum entropy methods. The difference between the
Bose-Einstein statistics and the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics is understood in
terms of a separable quantity, namely the degree of indistinguishability.
Starting from the usual Maxwell-Boltzmann microstate counting formula, a
special restriction related to the degree of indistinguishability is
incorporated using Lagrange multipliers to derive the probability distribution
function at equilibrium under NVE conditions. It is found that the resulting
probability distribution function generates real positive values within the
permissible range of parameters. For a dilute system, the probability
distribution function is intermediate between the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein
statistics and follows the exclusion principle. Properties of various variables
of this novel statistical model are studied and possible application to

fine spatial and temporal granularity is scarce, limiting our quantitative
understanding of long-term changes of built-up areas. This is because commonly
used mapping methods (e.g., image classification) and suitable data sources
(i.e., aerial imagery, multi-spectral remote sensing data, LiDAR) have only
been available in recent decades. However, there are alternative data sources
such as cadastral records that are digitally available, containing relevant
information such as building age information, allowing for an approximate,
digital reconstruction of past building distributions. We conducted a
non-exhaustive search of open and publicly available data resources from
administrative institutions in the United States and gathered, integrated, and
harmonized cadastral parcel data, tax assessment data, and building footprint
data for 33 counties, wherever building footprint geometries and building
construction year information was available. The result of this effort is a
unique dataset which we call the Multi-Temporal Building Footprint Dataset for
33 U.S. Counties (MTBF-33). MTBF-33 contains over 6.2 million building
footprints including their construction year, and can be used to derive
retrospective depictions of built-up areas from 1900 to 2015, at fine spatial
and temporal grain and can be used for data validation purposes, or to train
statistical learning approaches aiming to extract historical information on
human settlements from remote sensing data, historical maps, or similar data

synthesizes the slice-wise results of the CNNs, to provide the final prediction
at scan level. Our classifier was trained on 271,426 slices from 830

  with Shape-invariant Lie Group Transformer","6 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An effective way to model the complex real world is to view the world as a
composition of basic components of objects and transformations. Although humans
through development understand the compositionality of the real world, it is
extremely difficult to equip robots with such a learning mechanism. In recent
years, there has been significant research on autonomously learning
representations of the world using the deep learning; however, most studies
have taken a statistical approach, which requires a large number of training
data. Contrary to such existing methods, we take a novel algebraic approach for
representation learning based on a simpler and more intuitive formulation that
the observed world is the combination of multiple independent patterns and
transformations that are invariant to the shape of patterns. Since the shape of
patterns can be viewed as the invariant features against symmetric
transformations such as translation or rotation, we can expect that the
patterns can naturally be extracted by expressing transformations with
symmetric Lie group transformers and attempting to reconstruct the scene with
them. Based on this idea, we propose a model that disentangles the scenes into
the minimum number of basic components of patterns and Lie transformations from
only one sequence of images, by introducing the learnable shape-invariant Lie
group transformers as transformation components. Experiments show that given
one sequence of images in which two objects are moving independently, the
proposed model can discover the hidden distinct objects and multiple
shape-invariant transformations that constitute the scenes.

reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms lack transparency, affecting user trust
and hindering their deployment to high-risk tasks. Causal confusion refers to a
phenomenon where an agent learns spurious correlations between features which
might not hold across the entire state space, preventing safe deployment to
real tasks where such correlations might be broken. In this work, we examine
whether an agent relies on spurious correlations in critical states, and
propose an alternative subset of features on which it should base its decisions
instead, to make it less susceptible to causal confusion. Our goal is to
increase transparency of DRL agents by exposing the influence of learned
spurious correlations on its decisions, and offering advice to developers about
feature selection in different parts of state space, to avoid causal confusion.
We propose ReCCoVER, an algorithm which detects causal confusion in agent's
reasoning before deployment, by executing its policy in alternative
environments where certain correlations between features do not hold. We
demonstrate our approach in taxi and grid world environments, where ReCCoVER
detects states in which an agent relies on spurious correlations and offers a
set of features that should be considered instead.

application. With the development of deep learning, a large number of automatic
segmentation methods have been developed, but most of them stay in 2D images,
which leads to subpar performance. Moreover, the serious voxel imbalance
between the brain tumor and the background as well as the different sizes and
locations of the brain tumor makes the segmentation of 3D images a challenging
problem. Aiming at segmenting 3D MRI, we propose a model for brain tumor
segmentation with multiple encoders. The structure contains four encoders and
one decoder. The four encoders correspond to the four modalities of the MRI
image, perform one-to-one feature extraction, and then merge the feature maps
of the four modalities into the decoder. This method reduces the difficulty of
feature extraction and greatly improves model performance. We also introduced a
new loss function named ""Categorical Dice"", and set different weights for

management, outcome, and long-term survival of patients with heart disease. The
most recently published clinical guidelines for heart failure recognise that
over reliance on only one measure of cardiac function (LV ejection fraction) as
a diagnostic and treatment stratification biomarker is suboptimal. Recent
advances in AI-based echocardiography analysis have shown excellent results on
automated estimation of LV volumes and LV ejection fraction. However, from
time-varying 2-D echocardiography acquisition, a richer description of cardiac
function can be obtained by estimating functional biomarkers from the complete
cardiac cycle. In this work we propose for the first time an AI approach for
deriving advanced biomarkers of systolic and diastolic LV function from 2-D
echocardiography based on segmentations of the full cardiac cycle. These
biomarkers will allow clinicians to obtain a much richer picture of the heart
in health and disease. The AI model is based on the 'nn-Unet' framework and was
trained and tested using four different databases. Results show excellent
agreement between manual and automated analysis and showcase the potential of
the advanced systolic and diastolic biomarkers for patient stratification.
Finally, for a subset of 50 cases, we perform a correlation analysis between
clinical biomarkers derived from echocardiography and CMR and we show excellent
agreement between the two modalities.

$k$means algorithm and then it learns in the parallel way SGD models in each
data partition to classify the data locally. The incremental local SGD
sequentially loads small data blocks of the training dataset to learn local SGD
models. The numerical test results on Imagenet dataset show that our
incremental local SGD algorithm with the Raspberry Pi 4 is faster and more

depending on a real parameter bifurcation, is controlled by switching
periodically the parameter value. For this purpose the Parameter Switching (PS)
algorithm is used. With this technique, it is proved that every attractor of
the considered system can be numerically approximated and, therefore, the
system can be determined to evolve along, e.g., a stable periodic motion or a
chaotic attractor. In this way, the algorithm can be considered as a chaos
control or anticontrol (chaoticization)-like algorithm. Contrarily to existing
chaos control techniques which generate modified attractors, the obtained
attractors with the PS algorithm belong to the set system attractors. It is
analytically shown that using the PS algorithm, every system attractor can be
expressed as a convex combination of some existing attractors. Moreover, is
proved that the PS algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of
Parrondo\textsc{\char13}s paradox.

access to a variety of web page resources. At the same time, the current rapid
development of deep learning technology is often inseparable from the huge
amount of Web data resources. On the other hand, NLP is also an important part
of data processing technology, such as web page data extraction. At present,
the extraction technology of web page text mainly uses a single heuristic

manually. With the rapid growth of the number and types of web resources, there
are still problems to be solved when using a single strategy to extract the
text information of different pages. This paper proposes a web page text
extraction algorithm based on multi-feature fusion. According to the text
information characteristics of web resources, DOM nodes are used as the
extraction unit to design multiple statistical features, and high-order
features are designed according to heuristic strategies. This method
establishes a small neural network, takes multiple features of DOM nodes as
input, predicts whether the nodes contain text information, makes full use of
different statistical information and extraction strategies, and adapts to more
types of pages. Experimental results show that this method has a good ability
of web page text extraction and avoids the problem of manually determining the

Existing rule-based cache management methods, coupled with engineers' manual

workloads and complex storage systems, leading to frequent cache overloading.
In this paper, we for the first time propose a light-weight learning-based
cache bandwidth control technique, called \LQoCo which can adaptively control
the cache bandwidth so as to effectively prevent cache overloading in storage
systems. Extensive experiments with various workloads on real systems show that
LQoCo, with its strong adaptability and fast learning ability, can adapt to
various workloads to effectively control cache bandwidth, thereby significantly
improving the storage performance (e.g. increasing the throughput by 10\%-20\%
and reducing the throughput jitter and tail latency by 2X-6X and 1.5X-4X,
respectively, compared with two representative rule-based methods).

experimental ex-vivo approaches have been applied to numerous alveolar
geometries over the past years. They aimed to study and examine airflow
patterns, particle transport, and particle-alveolar wall deposition fractions.
These studies are imperative to both pharmaceutical and toxicological studies,
especially nowadays with the escalation of the menacing COVID-19 virus.
However, most of these studies ignored the surfactant layer that covers the
alveoli and the effect of the air-surfactant surface tension on flow dynamics
and air-alveolar surface mechanics. The present study employs a realistic human
breathing profile of 4.75 to emphasize the importance of the surfactant layer
by numerically comparing airflow phenomena between a surfactant-enriched and
surfactant-deficient model. The acinar model exhibits physiologically accurate
alveolar and duct dimensions extending from lung generations 18 to 23. Proximal
lung generations experience dominant recirculating flow while farther
generations in the distal alveolar region exhibit dominant radial flows. In the
surfactant-enriched model, surface tension values alternate during inhalation
and exhalation. In the surfactant-deficient model, only water coats the
alveolar walls. Results showed that surfactant deficiency in the alveoli
adversely alters airflow behavior and generates unsteady chaotic breathing
through the production of vorticities, accompanied by higher vorticity and
velocity magnitudes. In addition, high air-water surface tension in the
surfactant-deficient case was found to induce higher shear stress values on the
alveolar walls than that of the surfactant-enriched case. Overall, it was
concluded that the presence of the surfactant improves respiratory mechanics
and allows for smooth breathing and normal respiration.

address this challenge by proposing a dynamic pruning method, which exploits
the temporal stability of data across tokens to reduce inference cost. The
threshold-based method only retains significant differences between the
subsequent tokens, effectively reducing the number of multiply-accumulates, as
well as the internal tensor data sizes. The approach is evaluated on the Google
Speech Commands Dataset for keyword spotting, and the performance is compared
against the baseline Keyword Transformer. Our experiments show that we can
reduce ~80% of operations while maintaining the original 98.4% accuracy.
Moreover, a reduction of ~87-94% operations can be achieved when only degrading
the accuracy by 1-4%, speeding up the multi-head self-attention inference by a
