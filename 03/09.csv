sensitivity variations, and 1/$f$ noise on measured transmission spectra. By
fitting the time series systematics simultaneously with the injected transit,
we can obtain more realistic transit depth uncertainties that take into account
noise sources that are currently not modeled by traditional exposure time
calculators. We find that sources of systematic noise related to intrapixel
sensitivity variations and PSF motions are apparent in the data at the level of
a few hundred ppm, but can be effectively detrended using a low-order
polynomial with detector position. We recover the injected spectral features of
GJ 436 b and TRAPPIST-1 d, and place a 3-sigma upper limit on the detector

which reconstructs sparse signals from incoherently sampled data, has been
widely applied to accelerate MRI acquisitions. Compressed sensing MRI requires
one or more model parameters to be tuned, which is usually done by hand, giving
sub-optimal tuning in general. To address this issue, we build on previous work
by the authors on the single-coil Variable Density Approximate Message Passing
(VDAMP) algorithm, extending the framework to multiple receiver coils to
propose the Parallel VDAMP (P-VDAMP) algorithm. For Bernoulli random variable
density sampling, P-VDAMP obeys a ""state evolution"", where the intermediate
per-iteration image estimate is distributed according to the ground truth
corrupted by a zero-mean Gaussian vector with approximately known covariance.
To our knowledge, P-VDAMP is the first algorithm for multi-coil MRI data that
obeys a state evolution with accurately tracked parameters. We leverage state
evolution to automatically tune sparse parameters on-the-fly with Stein's
Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE). P-VDAMP is evaluated on brain, knee and
angiogram datasets and compared with four variants of the Fast Iterative
Shrinkage-Thresholding algorithm (FISTA), including two tuning-free variants
from the literature. The proposed method is found to have a similar
reconstruction quality and time to convergence as FISTA with an optimally tuned
sparse weighting and offers substantial robustness and reconstruction quality
improvements over competing tuning-free methods.

come from high-quality annotated labels, which are expensive to collect. Noisy
labels are more affordable, but result in corrupted representations, leading to
poor generalization performance. To learn robust representations and handle
noisy labels, we propose selective-supervised contrastive learning (Sel-CL) in
this paper. Specifically, Sel-CL extend supervised contrastive learning
(Sup-CL), which is powerful in representation learning, but is degraded when
there are noisy labels. Sel-CL tackles the direct cause of the problem of
Sup-CL. That is, as Sup-CL works in a \textit{pair-wise} manner, noisy pairs
built by noisy labels mislead representation learning. To alleviate the issue,
we select confident pairs out of noisy ones for Sup-CL without knowing noise
rates. In the selection process, by measuring the agreement between learned
representations and given labels, we first identify confident examples that are
exploited to build confident pairs. Then, the representation similarity
distribution in the built confident pairs is exploited to identify more
confident pairs out of noisy pairs. All obtained confident pairs are finally
used for Sup-CL to enhance representations. Experiments on multiple noisy
datasets demonstrate the robustness of the learned representations by our
method, following the state-of-the-art performance. Source codes are available

the mechanical behavior of heterogeneous materials have made it possible to
more thoroughly explore the massive input parameter space associated with
heterogeneous blocks of material. Specifically, we can train machine learning
(ML) models to closely approximate computationally expensive heterogeneous
material simulations where the ML model is trained on a dataset of simulations
that capture the range of spatial heterogeneity present in the material of
interest. However, when it comes to applying these techniques to biological
tissue more broadly, there is a major limitation: the relevant microstructural
patterns are both challenging to obtain and difficult to analyze. Consequently,
the number of useful examples available to characterize the input domain under
study is limited. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of ML-based
generative models as well as procedural methods as a tool for augmenting
limited input pattern datasets. We find that a Style-based Generative
Adversarial Network with adaptive discriminator augmentation is able to
successfully leverage just 1,000 example patterns to create the most authentic
generated patterns. In general, diverse generated patterns with adequate
resemblance to the real patterns can be used as inputs to finite element

pixel classification task to predict a class for each pixel from a fixed number
of predefined semantic categories shared by all images or videos. Yet,
following this formulation, standard architectures will inevitably encounter
various challenges under more realistic settings where the scope of categories
scales up (e.g., beyond the level of 1k). On the other hand, in a typical image
or video, only a few categories, i.e., a small subset of the complete label are
present. Motivated by this intuition, in this paper, we propose to decompose
segmentation into two sub-problems: (i) image-level or video-level multi-label
classification and (ii) pixel-level rank-adaptive selected-label
classification. Given an input image or video, our framework first conducts
multi-label classification over the complete label, then sorts the complete
label and selects a small subset according to their class confidence scores. We
then use a rank-adaptive pixel classifier to perform the pixel-wise
classification over only the selected labels, which uses a set of rank-oriented
learnable temperature parameters to adjust the pixel classifications scores.
Our approach is conceptually general and can be used to improve various
existing segmentation frameworks by simply using a lightweight multi-label
classification head and rank-adaptive pixel classifier. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework with competitive experimental results across
four tasks, including image semantic segmentation, image panoptic segmentation,
video instance segmentation, and video semantic segmentation. Especially, with

  in Clinical Trials",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Leveraging external controls -- relevant individual patient data under
control from external trials or real-world data -- has the potential to reduce
the cost of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) while increasing the proportion
of trial patients given access to novel treatments. However, due to lack of
randomization, RCT patients and external controls may differ with respect to
covariates that may or may not have been measured. Hence, after controlling for
measured covariates, for instance by matching, testing for treatment effect
using external controls may still be subject to unmeasured biases. In this
paper, we propose a sensitivity analysis approach to quantify the magnitude of
unmeasured bias that would be needed to alter the study conclusion that
presumed no unmeasured biases are introduced by employing external controls.
Whether leveraging external controls increases power or not depends on the
interplay between sample sizes and the magnitude of treatment effect and
unmeasured biases, which may be difficult to anticipate. This motivates a
combined testing procedure that performs two highly correlated analyses, one
with and one without external controls, with a small correction for multiple
testing using the joint distribution of the two test statistics. The combined
test provides a new method of sensitivity analysis designed for data fusion
problems, which anchors at the unbiased analysis based on RCT only and spends a
small proportion of the type I error to also test using the external controls.
In this way, if leveraging external controls increases power, the power gain
compared to the analysis based on RCT only can be substantial; if not, the
power loss is small. The proposed method is evaluated in theory and power
calculations, and applied to a real trial.

generalize to unseen class data by only using auxiliary information. One of the
main challenges in GZSL is a biased model prediction toward seen classes caused
by overfitting on only available seen class data during training. To overcome
this issue, we propose a two-stream autoencoder-based gating model for GZSL.
Our gating model predicts whether the query data is from seen classes or unseen
classes, and utilizes separate seen and unseen experts to predict the class
independently from each other. This framework avoids comparing the biased
prediction scores for seen classes with the prediction scores for unseen
classes. In particular, we measure the distance between visual and attribute
representations in the latent space and the cross-reconstruction space of the
autoencoder. These distances are utilized as complementary features to
characterize unseen classes at different levels of data abstraction. Also, the
two-stream autoencoder works as a unified framework for the gating model and
the unseen expert, which makes the proposed method computationally efficient.
We validate our proposed method in four benchmark image recognition datasets.
In comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the best harmonic
mean accuracy in SUN and AWA2, and the second best in CUB and AWA1.
Furthermore, our base model requires at least 20% less number of model

assume that all labels are noisy, while it is usually the case that a few
trusted samples with clean labels are available. This raises the following
important question: how can we effectively use a small amount of trusted data
to facilitate robust classifier learning from multiple annotators? This paper
proposes a data-efficient approach, called \emph{Trustable Co-label Learning}
(TCL), to learn deep classifiers from multiple noisy annotators when a small
set of trusted data is available. This approach follows the coupled-view
learning manner, which jointly learns the data classifier and the label
aggregator. It effectively uses trusted data as a guide to generate trustable
soft labels (termed co-labels). A co-label learning can then be performed by
alternately reannotating the pseudo labels and refining the classifiers. In
addition, we further improve TCL for a special complete data case, where each
instance is labeled by all annotators and the label aggregator is represented
by multilayer neural networks to enhance model capacity. Extensive experiments
on synthetic and real datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed approach. Source code is available at

broadband-filter reflected photometric flux on Earth-like exoplanets in three
forms: seawater, water-clouds and snow; based on 53,130 spectra of cold,
Earth-like planets with 6 major surfaces. XGBoost, a well-known machine

First, we show that PLC transformations among graph states are equivalent to a

Clifford transformations among graph states. Then, we introduce a mathematical
framework to study PLC equivalence of stabilizer states, relating it to the
classification of tuples of bilinear forms. This framework allows us to study
decompositions of stabilizer states into tensor products of indecomposable

infinite set, even when considering party-local unitary transformations.

Finally, we generalize the framework to qudit stabilizer states in prime

interferometer (FPI) is easier to fabricate, it is often plagued by Coulomb
interactions (3), its area breathes with the magnetic field (4), and its bulk's

screening allowed an observation of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference at bulk
filling $\nu$=1/3 (6). In the current work, we chose to employ an
interaction-free, two-path, Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), tuned to bulk
filling $\nu$=2/5. Interfering the outer $\nu$=1/3 mode (with the inner
$\nu$=1/15 mode screening out the bulk), we observed a 'dressed AB'
periodicity, with a combined 'bare AB' flux periodicity of three flux-quanta
(3$\phi_0$) and the 'braiding phase' 2$\pi$/3. This unique interference
resulted with an AB periodicity of a single flux-quantum. Moreover, the
visibility of the interference, $v_{e/3}$, deviated markedly from that of the
electronic one $\it{v}_{e}$, agreeing with the theoretically expected
visibility, $\it{v}_{e/3} \sim {\it{v}_e}^3$. With the two non-equivalent

matter in the mass range $(10^{-11} - 10^{3}) M_{\odot}$. Primordial Black
Holes (PBHs) form clusters, and it has been argued that these microlensing
constraints are consequently weakened or evaded. For the most commonly studied
PBH formation mechanism, the collapse of large gaussian curvature perturbations
generated by inflation, the clusters are sufficiently extended that the PBHs
within them act as individual lenses. We find that if the typical mass of the
clusters is sufficiently large, $ \gtrsim 10^{6} M_{\odot}$, then the event
duration distribution can deviate significantly from that produced by a smooth
dark matter distribution, in particular at the shortest durations. As a
consequence of this, the probability distribution of the number of observed
events is non-Poissonian, peaking at a lower value, with an extended tail to
large numbers of events. However, for PBHs formed from the collapse of large
inflationary perturbations, the typical cluster is expected to contain $\sim
10^{3}$ PBHs. In this case the effect of clustering is negligibly small, apart
from for the most massive PBHs probed by decade-long stellar microlensing
surveys ($M_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{3} M_{\odot}$).

realizations of such EGB theories, quadratic in the dilaton field, beside their
local quartic forms, are possible by a finite renormalization of the Euler
density. Such nonlocal versions, which are deprived of any scale, can be
expanded, at least around flat space, in terms of the combination $R \Box^{-1}$
times multiple variations of the anomaly functional, as pointed out in recent
studies at $d=4$. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the proposed nonlocal

conformal Ward identities that constrain such theories around the flat

nonnegative digraphs. In particular, for the so-called ""repelling"" signed
Laplacians, the marginal stability property (needed to achieve consensus) is
not guaranteed a priori and, even when it holds, it does not automatically lead
to consensus, as these signed Laplacians may loose rank even in strongly
connected digraphs. Furthermore, in the time-varying case, instability can
occur even when switching in a family of systems each of which corresponds to a
marginally stable signed Laplacian with the correct corank. In this paper we
present conditions guaranteeing consensus of these signed Laplacians based on
the property of eventual positivity, a Perron-Frobenius type of property for
signed matrices. The conditions cover both time-invariant and time-varying
cases. A particularly simple sufficient condition valid in both cases is that
the Laplacians are normal matrices. Such condition can be relaxed in several
ways. For instance in the time-invariant case it is enough that the Laplacian
has this Perron-Frobenius property on the right but not on the left side (i.e.,
on the transpose). For the time-varying case, convergence to consensus can be
guaranteed by the existence of a common Lyapunov function for all the signed
Laplacians. All conditions can be easily extended to bipartite consensus.

central receiver. We assume that each transmitter employs a unique mixture of
different types of signaling molecules to represent its message and the
receiver is equipped with an array comprising $R$ different types of receptors
in order to detect the emitted molecule mixtures. The design of an MC system
based on \textit{orthogonal} molecule-receptor pairs implies that the hardware
complexity of the receiver linearly scales with the number of signaling
molecule types $Q$ (i.e., $R=Q$). Natural olfaction systems avoid such high
complexity by employing arrays of \textit{cross-reactive} receptors, where each
type of molecule activates multiple types of receptors and each type of
receptor is predominantly activated by multiple types of molecules albeit with
different activation strengths. For instance, the human olfactory system is
believed to discriminate several thousands of chemicals using only a few
hundred receptor types, i.e., $Q\gg R$. Motivated by this observation, we first
develop an end-to-end MC channel model that accounts for the key properties of
olfaction. Subsequently, we present the proposed transmitter and receiver
designs. In particular, given a set of signaling molecules, we develop
algorithms that allocate molecules to different transmitters and optimize the
mixture alphabet for communication. Moreover, we formulate the molecule mixture
recovery as a convex compressive sensing problem which can be efficiently

of series-connected cells equipped with an active balancing circuitry. The
cells in the module are subject to heterogeneity induced by manufacturing
defects and non-uniform operating conditions. Each cell is expressed via a
coupled nonlinear electrochemical, thermal, and aging model and the direct
collocation approach is employed to transcribe the OCP into a nonlinear
programming problem (NLP). The proposed OCP is formulated under two different
schemes of charging operation: (i) same-charging-time (OCP-SCT) and (ii)
different-charging-time (OCP-DCT). The former assumes simultaneous charging of
all cells irrespective of their initial conditions, whereas the latter allows
for different charging times of the cells to account for heterogeneous initial
conditions. The problem is solved for a module with two series-connected cells
with intrinsic heterogeneity among them in terms of state of charge and state
of health. Results show that the OCP-DCT scheme provides more flexibility to
deal with heterogeneity, boasting of lower temperature increase, charging
current amplitudes, and degradation. Finally, comparison with the common
practice of constant current (CC) charging over a long-term cycling operation

computing, communication and collaboration among devices become popular for
accomplishing various tasks. The use of relays in IoT networks further makes it
convenient to deploy IoT networks as relays provide a host of benefits, like
increasing the communication range and minimizing power consumption. Existing
literature on traditional AoI schedulers for such two-hop relayed IoT networks
are limited because they are designed assuming constant/non-changing channel
conditions and known (usually, generate-at-will) packet generation patterns.
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been investigated for AoI
scheduling in two-hop IoT networks with relays, however, they are only
applicable for small-scale IoT networks due to exponential rise in action space
as the networks become large. These limitations discourage the practical
utilization of AoI schedulers for IoT network deployments. This paper presents
a practical AoI scheduler for two-hop IoT networks with relays that addresses
the above limitations. The proposed scheduler utilizes a novel voting mechanism
based proximal policy optimization (v-PPO) algorithm that maintains a linear
action space, enabling it be scale well with larger IoT networks. The proposed
v-PPO based AoI scheduler adapts well to changing network conditions and
accounts for unknown traffic generation patterns, making it practical for
real-world IoT deployments. Simulation results show that the proposed v-PPO
based AoI scheduler outperforms both ML and traditional (non-ML) AoI
schedulers, such as, Deep Q Network (DQN)-based AoI Scheduler, Maximal Age
First-Maximal Age Difference (MAF-MAD), MAF (Maximal Age First) , and
round-robin in all considered practical scenarios.

arbitrary edge, we adopt a variant of the popular Transformer model to predict
the edges associated with the same face in a natural order. This allows us to
avoid searching the space of all possible edge loops with various hand-crafted

To investigate the effect of shielding of young stellar objects by star forming
material, we track the FUV field history at each star in the cluster with two
methods: i) Monte Carlo radiative transfer accounting for the shielding of
stars from the FUV by the star forming cloud ii) Geometric dilution of the
radiation from other stars which ignores shielding effects. We found that
significant shielding only occurs for a small fraction of discs and offers
protection from external photoevaporation for < 0.5 Myr. However, this initial
protection can prevent significant early gas/dust mass loss and disc radius
reduction due to external photoevaporation. Particularly, shielding for 0.5 Myr
is sufficient for much of the solid reservoir to evolve to larger sizes where
it will not be entrained in an external wind. Shielding is therefore
potentially significant for terrestrial planet formation in retaining the solid
mass budget, but the continued stripping of gas when shielding ends could still
impact migration and the gas reservoir for giant planet atmospheres. Our models
highlight issues with treating all discs in a cluster with a single
characteristic age, since shielded objects are typically only the youngest. Our
model predicts that the majority of discs in a 2 Myr Carina-like environment
are subject to strong external photoevaporation.

Specifically, the motion prediction module is first introduced to estimate a
potential target center of the current frame in a point-cloud-free manner.
Then, an explicit voting module is proposed to directly regress the 3D box from
the estimated target center. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes
datasets demonstrate that our DMT can still achieve better performance (~10%
improvement over the NuScenes dataset) and a faster tracking speed (i.e., 72

In order to tackle problems with complex, high-dimensional observations, there
has been significant interest from theoreticians and practitioners alike in
understanding the possibility of function approximation in reinforcement
learning. Despite significant study, a sharp characterization of when we might
expect offline policy evaluation to be tractable, even in the simplest setting
of linear function approximation, has so far remained elusive, with a
surprising number of strong negative results recently appearing in the
literature.
  In this work, we identify simple control-theoretic and linear-algebraic
conditions that are necessary and sufficient for classical methods, in
particular Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and least squares temporal difference
learning (LSTD), to succeed at offline policy evaluation. Using this
characterization, we establish a precise hierarchy of regimes under which these
estimators succeed. We prove that LSTD works under strictly weaker conditions
than FQI. Furthermore, we establish that if a problem is not solvable via LSTD,
then it cannot be solved by a broad class of linear estimators, even in the
limit of infinite data. Taken together, our results provide a complete picture
of the behavior of linear estimators for offline policy evaluation, unify
previously disparate analyses of canonical algorithms, and provide
significantly sharper notions of the underlying statistical complexity of
offline policy evaluation.

from the radio source, respectively. For CLASS B0712+472, we find that the
X-ray emission is co-spatial with the radio and optical emission. While, in
CLASS B1608+656, the X-ray emission is co-spatial with radio, but displaced
with respect to the optical emission at 1$\sigma$ level, which positions this
source as an offset AGN candidate. This high astrometric precision improves on
the limitations of existing X-ray instruments by two orders of magnitude. The
demonstrated method opens a path to search for offset and binary AGN at $z>1$,
and to directly test supermassive black hole formation models in a redshift
range that has been mostly underconstrained to date.

  data analysis",,,,,"stat.ME math.AT stat.AP stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Topological data analysis (TDA) provides a set of data analysis tools for
extracting embedded topological structures from complex high-dimensional
datasets. In recent years, TDA has been a rapidly growing field which has found
success in a wide range of applications, including signal processing,
neuroscience and network analysis. In these applications, the online detection
of changes is of crucial importance, but this can be highly challenging since
such changes often occur in a low-dimensional embedding within high-dimensional
data streams. We thus propose a new method, called PERsistence diagram-based
ChangE-PoinT detection (PERCEPT), which leverages the learned topological
structure from TDA to sequentially detect changes. PERCEPT follows two key
steps: it first learns the embedded topology as a point cloud via persistence
diagrams, then applies a non-parametric monitoring approach for detecting
changes in the resulting point cloud distributions. This yields a
non-parametric, topology-aware framework which can efficiently detect online
changes from high-dimensional data streams. We investigate the effectiveness of
PERCEPT over existing methods in a suite of numerical experiments where the
data streams have an embedded topological structure. We then demonstrate the
usefulness of PERCEPT in two applications in solar flare monitoring and human
gesture detection.

Hypothesis (LTH) provides a novel view to investigate sparse network training

from a randomly initialized network found by iterative magnitude pruning and
preserving promising trainability (or we say being in trainable condition). In
this work, we regard the winning ticket from LTH as the subnetwork which is in
trainable condition and its performance as our benchmark, then go from a
complementary direction to articulate the Dual Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
(DLTH): Randomly selected subnetworks from a randomly initialized dense network
can be transformed into a trainable condition and achieve admirable performance
compared with LTH -- random tickets in a given lottery pool can be transformed
into winning tickets. Specifically, by using uniform-randomly selected
subnetworks to represent the general cases, we propose a simple sparse network
training strategy, Random Sparse Network Transformation (RST), to substantiate
our DLTH. Concretely, we introduce a regularization term to borrow learning
capacity and realize information extrusion from the weights which will be
masked. After finishing the transformation for the randomly selected
subnetworks, we conduct the regular finetuning to evaluate the model using fair
comparisons with LTH and other strong baselines. Extensive experiments on

relative effects of these forces providing a narrative explanation of the
curvature in variable behaviour. Using the stock/flow form of a model, a
symbolic notation is developed that identifies the forces with the causal
pathways of the model's feedback loops. A force is measured by its impact,
defined as the ratio of acceleration to rate of change, computed by
differentiation along its associated pathway between variables. Different
phases of force dominance are determined to enhance the standard stability
analysis of the models, providing an explanation of model behaviour in
Newtonian mechanical terms. The concepts developed are applied to well-known
models from mathematical biology: the Spruce Budworm model, where force
dominance identifies scenarios that give clarity to intervention points; and
the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model where the analysis highlights the
importance of dissipative forces in achieving stability. Conclusions are drawn

simulations. In this study, we assume that bubbles can be modeled as rigid
bodies and demonstrate that intact bubbles and their long-term interactions
with the ambient ICM play an important role in shaping gas kinematics, forming
thin gaseous structures (e.g., H$\alpha$ filaments), and generating internal
waves in cluster cores. We find that well-developed eddies are formed in the
wake of a buoyantly rising bubble, and it is these eddies, rather than the
Darwin drift, that are responsible for most of the gas mass uplift. The eddies
gradually elongate along the bubble's direction of motion due to the strong
density stratification of the atmosphere and eventually detach from the bubble,
quickly evolving into a high-speed jet-like stream propagating towards the
cluster center. This picture naturally explains the presence of long straight
and horseshoe-shaped H$\alpha$ filaments in the Perseus cluster, inward and
outward motions of the gas, and the X-ray-weighted gas velocity distributions
near the northwestern bubble observed by Hitomi. Our model reproduces the
observed H$\alpha$ velocity structure function of filaments, providing a simple
interpretation for its steep scaling and normalization: laminar gas flows and
large eddies within filaments driven by the intact bubbles, rather than
spatially homogeneous small-scale turbulence, are sufficient to produce a

  problem","Contains results previously included in arXiv:2107.11286",,,,"quant-ph cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The diagonal distance or graph distance is an important parameter of a
quantum error-correcting code that characterizes whether the code is degenerate
or not. Degeneracy is a property unique to quantum codes, which allows quantum
codes, unlike their classical counterparts, to correct more errors than they
can uniquely identify. In the CWS framework introduced by Cross, Smith, Smolin
and Zeng (2009), a quantum code is constructed using a classical code and a
graph. It is known that the diagonal distance of such a code is upper bounded
by $\delta+1$, where $\delta$ is the minimum degree of the associated graph. In
this paper, we give sufficient conditions on a graph such that a CWS code
constructed from it has diagonal distance at least $\delta$, and in fact most
of the graphs in our sufficient class achieve the upper bound of $\delta+1$.
  Using this result, first we give necessary conditions for a CWS code to be
degenerate. Secondly, we prove hardness results for the problem of finding the
distance of a CWS code. We construct a CWS code from a given classical code,
with the distance of the CWS code being equal to the distance of the classical
code. This allows us to translate well-known hardness results for computing the
minimum distance in classical codes to quantum codes. Specifically, we show
that exactly computing the distance of a CWS code is NP-complete, and
multiplicatively or additively approximating it is NP-hard under
polynomial-time randomized reductions. Our reduction from the classical
problems to the quantum problems results in a non-degenerate quantum code,
hence our result implies that the quantum problems remain NP-hard even with the
promise that the code is non-degenerate. Moreover, using a mapping from
stabilizer codes to CSS codes due to Bravyi, Terhal and Leemhuis (2010), we are
able to show that the hardness results hold for CSS codes as well.

nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ (dubbed ILTT$_{1}$ analysis here
after). A major thrust of the ILTT$_{1}$ analysis is that one can deduce the
probability density function $P(1/T_1)$ of distributed $1/T_1$. We demonstrate
that $1/T_{1}^{lm}$, defined as the log-mean (i.e. the center of gravity on a
logarithmic scale) of $P(1/T_1)$, can be well approximated by $1/T_{1}^{str}$
deduced from the phenomenological stretched fit, however, $P(1/T_1)$ can
provide much richer insight into how the lattice, charge, and spin fluctuations
and their distribution develop near and below the long range charge order at
$T_{charge} \sim 54$~K. Upon entering the charge ordered state, a divergent
increase of $1/T_{1}^{lm}$ toward the spin ordering at $T_{spin}^{\mu SR}
\simeq 35$~K is accompanied by an asymmetric broadening of $P(1/T_1)$. Even
deep inside the charge ordered state, $1/T_{1}$ at a gradually diminishing
fraction of $^{139}$La sites continues to slow down as temperature is lowered,
as expected for canonical superconducting CuO$_2$ planes without enhanced spin
fluctuations. The fraction of such canonical $^{139}$La sites almost disappears
by $\simeq 40$~K. In contrast, nearly a half of the $^{139}$La sites in
La$_{1.885}$Sr$_{0.115}$CuO$_{4}$ ($T_{charge} \simeq 80$~K) still exhibits the
canonical behavior without enhanced spin fluctuations even near its $T_{c} =
31$~K. These contrasting behaviors explain why superconductivity in
La$_{1.875}$Ba$_{0.125}$CuO$_{4}$ is more strongly suppressed than in
La$_{1.885}$Sr$_{0.115}$CuO$_{4}$ despite the lower onset temperature of the

resummation that are arguably no more complicated than those that appear in
standard techniques ubiquitous in the literature. In particular, we implement
renormalisation group improvement related to the hard thermal scale. Despite

contain only about 10K-20K pairs of sign videos, gloss annotations and texts,
which are an order of magnitude smaller than typical parallel data for training
spoken language translation models. Data is thus a bottleneck for training
effective sign language translation models. To mitigate this problem, we
propose to progressively pretrain the model from general-domain datasets that
include a large amount of external supervision to within-domain datasets.
Concretely, we pretrain the sign-to-gloss visual network on the general domain
of human actions and the within-domain of a sign-to-gloss dataset, and pretrain
the gloss-to-text translation network on the general domain of a multilingual
corpus and the within-domain of a gloss-to-text corpus. The joint model is
fine-tuned with an additional module named the visual-language mapper that
connects the two networks. This simple baseline surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art results on two sign language translation benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning. With its simplicity and
strong performance, this approach can serve as a solid baseline for future

why the dynamics of available information play an essential role in governing
the fidelity of PQ, and why PQ in the analysis of safety-critical protective

coordinate system - a technique widely used in various applications of computer
vision, such as remote sensing, image retrieval, and most commonly in medical
imaging. Deep Learning based techniques have been applied successfully to
tackle various complex medical image processing problems, including medical
image registration. Over the years, several image registration techniques have
been proposed using deep learning. Deformable image registration techniques
such as Voxelmorph have been successful in capturing finer changes and
providing smoother deformations. However, Voxelmorph, as well as ICNet and
FIRE, do not explicitly encode global dependencies (i.e. the overall anatomical
view of the supplied image) and therefore can not track large deformations. In
order to tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper extends the Voxelmorph
approach in three different ways. To improve the performance in case of small
as well as large deformations, supervision of the model at different
resolutions have been integrated using a multi-scale UNet. To support the
network to learn and encode the minute structural co-relations of the given
image-pairs, a self-constructing graph network (SCGNet) has been used as the
latent of the multi-scale UNet - which can improve the learning process of the
model and help the model to generalise better. And finally, to make the
deformations inverse-consistent, cycle consistency loss has been employed. On
the task of registration of brain MRIs, the proposed method achieved
significant improvements over ANTs and VoxelMorph, obtaining a Dice score of
0.8013$\pm$0.0243 for intramodal and 0.6211$\pm$0.0309 for intermodal, while
VoxelMorph achieved 0.7747$\pm$0.0260 and 0.6071$\pm$0.0510, respectively.

then photons polarized parallel to the direction of the MWD's magnetic field
may convert into axions, which induces a linear polarization dependent on the
strength of the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$. We model this
process by using the formalism of axion-photon mixing in the presence of
strong-field vacuum birefringence to show that of all stellar types MWDs are
the most promising targets for axion-induced polarization searches. We then
consider linear polarization data from multiple MWDs, including SDSS J135141

reconnection in a current sheet of the magnetar wind. Compressed by a strong

interfaces produce coherent radiation during their hierarchical coalescence. We
investigate this scenario using 2D radiative relativistic particle-in-cell

properties of galaxies with time, wherein rotationally-supported and steady
thin discs (like those frequently observed in the local universe) emerge from
galaxies that are clumpy, irregular, and have bursty star formation rates
(SFRs). To better understand the progenitors of local disc galaxies we carry
out an analysis of three FIRE-2 simulated galaxies with a mass similar to the
Milky Way at redshift z=0. We show that all three galaxies transition from
bursty to steady SFRs at a redshift between z=0.5 and z=0.8, and that this
transition coincides with a rapid (< ~1 Gyr) emergence of a
rotationally-supported interstellar medium (ISM).In the late phase with steady
SFR, the rotational energy comprises > ~90% of the total kinetic + thermal
energy in the ISM, and is roughly half the gravitational energy. By contrast,
during the early phase with bursty star formation, the ISM has a
quasi-spheroidal morphology and its energy budget is dominated by
quasi-isotropic flows including turbulence and coherent inflows/outflows. This
result, that rotational support is subdominant at early times, challenges the
common application of equilibrium disc models to the high-redshift progenitors
of Milky Way-like galaxies. We further find that the formation of a
rotation-supported ISM coincides with the formation of a thermal
energy-supported inner circumgalactic medium (CGM). Before this transition, the
inner CGM is also supported by turbulence and coherent flows, indicating that
at early times there is no clear boundary between the ISM and inner CGM.

low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) ubiquitously exist in QGs.
Moreover, the X-ray AGN luminosity of QGs at $z>1.5$ is higher than that of

2-dimensional system, which makes them crucial in determining the associated
topological quantum field theory (TQFT). Most numerical methods for detecting
the TQFT relied on the use of minimum entanglement states (MESs), extracting
the anyon mutual statistics and self statistics via overlaps and/or the
entanglement spectra. The MESs are the eigenstates of the Wilson loop
operators, and are labeled by the anyons corresponding to their eigenvalues.
Here we revisit the definition of the Wilson loop operators and MESs. We derive
the modular transformation of the ground states purely from the Wilson loop
algebra, and as a result, the modular $S$- and $T$-matrices naturally show up
in the overlap of MESs. Importantly, we show that due to the phase degree of
freedom of the Wilson loop operators, the MES-anyon assignment is not unique.
This ambiguity obstructs our attempt to detect the topological order, that is,
there exist different TQFTs that cannot be distinguished solely by the overlap
of MESs. In this paper, we provide the upper limit of the information one may
obtain from the overlap of MESs without other additional structure. Finally, we
show that if the phase is enriched by rotational symmetry, there may be
additional TQFT information that can be extracted from overlap of MESs.

run a suite of $N$-body simulations following the early dynamical evolution and
violent relaxation of rotating star clusters embedded in a tidal field. Our
study focuses on models for which the cluster's rotation axis has a generic
orientation relative to the torque of the tidal field. The interaction between
the violent relaxation process, angular momentum of the cluster, and the
external torque creates a complex kinematic structure within the cluster, most
prominently a radial variation in the position of the rotation axis along both
the polar and azimuthal directions. We also examine the cluster's velocity
dispersion anisotropy and show that the projected anisotropy may be affected by
the variation of the rotation axis directions within the cluster; the
combination of projection effects and the complex kinematical features may
result in the measurement of tangential anisotropy in the cluster's inner
regions. We also characterize the structural properties of our clusters as a
function of their initial rotation and virial ratio and find that clusters may
develop a triaxial morphology and a radial variation of the minor axis not
necessarily aligned with the rotation axis. Finally, we examine the long-term
evolution of these complex kinematic features.

of these properties are consistent with the tidal disruption and
hyper-accretion of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star by a black hole (BH) or neutron star
(NS) binary companion. In contrast with related previous models, the merger
occurs with a long delay (>~ 100 years) following the common envelope (CE)
event responsible for birthing the binary, as a result of gradual angular
momentum loss to a relic circumbinary disk. Disk-wind outflows from the
merger-generated accretion flow generate the 56Ni-poor aspherical ejecta with
the requisite velocity range. The optical light curve is powered primarily by
reprocessing X-rays from the inner accretion flow/jet, though CSM shock
interaction also contributes. Primary CSM sources include mass-loss from WR
star (e.g., from the L2 point) during the earliest stages of the merger (~<1e14
cm) and the relic CE disk and its photoevaporation-driven wind (>~ 1e16 cm).
Longer delayed mergers may instead give rise to supernovae Type Ibn/Icn

unattenuated through the Universe, before they mix back to photons in the Milky

dominated by the gravity of the central sources. An additional third source,
forming due to instabilities in the streamer, cannot be ruled out as a

expenditures in the US. At the same time, the number of non-hospital
rehabilitative settings, such as skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), has
increased. Lower costs and increased availability have made SNFs and other
non-hospital rehabilitation settings a promising care alternative to
hospitalization. To maximize their benefits, transitions to SNFs require
special attention, since poorly coordinated transitions can lead to worse
outcomes and higher costs via unnecessary hospital readmissions. This study
presents a framework to improve care transitions based on the premise that
certain SNFs may provide better care for some patients. We estimate readmission
rates by SNF and patient types using observational data from a tertiary
teaching hospital and nearby SNFs. We then analyze and solve a stochastic model
optimizing patient transfer decisions to minimize readmissions. Our model
accounts for patient discharge patterns and SNF capacity availability. We
provide conditions for when an easy-to-use myopic policy, which assigns
discharged patients to the SNF with the lowest readmission rate that is
available, is optimal. We also show when an optimal policy has a threshold-like
structure. Using estimated readmission rates, we compare the performance of the
myopic policy and a proposed policy that depends on the discharge process,
readmission rates, and future SNF availability. We evaluate when the myopic
policy may be beneficial to use and when the proposed transfer heuristic
provides a better alternative. Otherwise, we contend that using a stochastic
optimization model for guiding transfer decisions may help reduce readmissions.

decreases over time, which is connected to the decay of magnetic energy in the

10\%$ lower $D^{\rm pkSZ}_{\ell=3000}$ and a flatter slope in the
$\Delta_z-D^{\rm pkSZ}_{\ell=3000}$ scaling relation, thereby affecting the

$\lambda_{\rm mfp}$ to vary simultaneously, we get spectra consistent with the
SPT result ($95\%$ CL) up to $\Delta_z=12.8$ (but $A_z>8$ is needed to ensure
an end of reionization before $z=5.5$). We show that constraints on the
asymmetry require $\sim 0.1\,\mu k^2$ measurement accuracy at multipoles other
than $\ell=3000$. Finally, we find that the amplitude and shape of the kSZ
spectrum are only weakly sensitive to $M_h$ under a fixed reionization history

observation that facilitates effective sampling is that, using one of the BCT

index. The H-alpha excess and deficit follow the behavior of the solar activity
over the course of the cycle, whereby the peak of the H-alpha deficit is
shortly after the solar maximum. The H-alpha excess is closely correlated to
the chromospheric MgII index. The highest correlation of the H-alpha deficit is
found with the F10.7cm radio flux. The H-alpha deficit reflects the cyclic
behavior of polar crown filaments and their disappearance shortly before the
solar maximum. We investigated the mean intensity distribution for H-alpha
excess regions for solar minimum and maximum, whereby the shape of the
distributions is very similar, but with different amplitudes. Furthermore, we
investigate whether the area coverage fraction or the changing H-alpha excess
in the active regions dominates temporal variability in solar H-alpha

critical role in assembling the material to form stars. The dominant filaments
are observed to have a rather narrow range of widths around $\sim 0.1$ pc, and
to be preferentially aligned perpendicularly to the direction of the local
magnetic field. We have previously argued that the observed filament widths can
be explained if filaments are formed by converging, mildly supersonic flows,
resulting from large-scale turbulent motions in the parent molecular cloud.
Here we demonstrate that the introduction of a magnetic field perpendicular to
the filament long axis does not greatly alter this conclusion, as long as the
mass-to-flux ratio is supercritical. The distribution of widths for
supercritical magnetised filaments formed via this mechanism is peaked at
slightly higher values, and is slightly broader, than for non-magnetised
filaments, but still reproduces the basic properties of the width distributions
derived from far-infrared observations of molecular clouds. In contrast,
subcritical filaments have width distributions with a fundamentally different
shape, and typically have much larger widths than those observed. Both
subcritical and supercritical filaments are consistent with the observed lack
of correlation between filament widths and filament surface densities.

bound a global loss function like the sum of squared error, or a sum of Huber
losses in the case of quantile regression in Padilla and Chatterjee (2021).
Clearly, element wise bounds are stronger than global loss error bounds as it
reveals how the loss behaves locally at each point. Our element wise error
bound also has a clean and explicit dependence on the tuning parameter
$\lambda$ which informs the user of a good choice of $\lambda$. In addition,

Department (ED). Extending treatment time is considered a promising solution
for improving admission decisions. Providing empirical support for this
solution, however, is difficult because this intervention (treatment) is a
continuous time-to-event; is strongly influenced by unmeasured patient health
needs and is jointly determined with the admission decision (admit vs.
discharge); and may be only modifiable up to a shift in the realized time. We
formalize the admission process as a directed acyclic graph and show that
average responses curves for treatment time cannot be identified
nonparametrically due to unmeasured confounding from patient health needs. We
thus use a parametric model that includes a latent variable for health needs
and a threshold regression model for the admission process. We fit this model
to observational data (n = 28,862) from abdominal pain patients at a large
tertiary teaching hospital. We estimate that fixing ED treatment time to 2
hours rather than 1 hour decreases admission rates from 41.6% (95% CI: [40.6,
42.7]) to 32.7% (95% CI: [32.2, 33.2]) and that increasing the realized
treatment time by 30 minutes can reduce admission rates by 1.1% (95% CI: [-1.1,

characterizes the violation of unconfoundedness in causal inference. It assumes
the selection bias due to unmeasured confounding is bounded ""on average"";
compared with the widely used point-wise sensitivity models in the literature,
it is able to capture the strength of unmeasured confounding by not only its
magnitude but also the chance of encountering such a magnitude.
  We propose a framework for sensitivity analysis under our new model based on
a distributional robustness perspective. We first show that the bounds on
counterfactual means under the f-sensitivity model are optimal solutions to a
new class of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) programs, whose dual
forms are essentially risk minimization problems. We then construct point
estimators for these bounds by applying a novel debiasing technique to the
output of the corresponding empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems. Our
estimators are shown to converge to valid bounds on counterfactual means if any
nuisance component can be estimated consistently, and to the exact bounds when
the ERM step is additionally consistent. We further establish asymptotic
normality and Wald-type inference for these estimators under slower-than-root-n
convergence rates of the estimated nuisance components. Finally, the
performance of our method is demonstrated with numerical experiments.

business level. Consequently, software companies keep trading code quality for
time-to-market and new features. The resulting technical debt is estimated to
waste up to 42% of developers' time. At the same time, there is a global
shortage of software developers, meaning that developer productivity is key to
software businesses. Our overall mission is to make code quality a business
concern, not just a technical aspect. Our first goal is to understand how code
quality impacts 1) the number of reported defects, 2) the time to resolve
issues, and 3) the predictability of resolving issues on time. We analyze 39
proprietary production codebases from a variety of domains using the CodeScene
tool based on a combination of source code analysis, version-control mining,
and issue information from Jira. By analyzing activity in 30,737 files, we find
that low quality code contains 15 times more defects than high quality code.
Furthermore, resolving issues in low quality code takes on average 124% more
time in development. Finally, we report that issue resolutions in low quality
code involve higher uncertainty manifested as 9 times longer maximum cycle
times. This study provides evidence that code quality cannot be dismissed as a
technical concern. With 15 times fewer defects, twice the development speed,
and substantially more predictable issue resolution times, the business
advantage of high quality code should be unmistakably clear.

locally insensitive to the perturbations of the initial data. Since the

observe one or two components of the system in a localized observation set. By
some classical arguments, the insensitizing problem can be reduced to a
null-controllability one for a cascade system where the number of equations is
doubled. Upon linearization, the null-controllability for this new system is
studied by means of Carleman estimates but unlike other insensitizing problems

mirrors of structures. The proposal is based on the premise that deterministic
models cannot account for the uncertainty present in most structural modelling
applications. Two different types of generative models are considered here. The
first is a physics-based model based on the stochastic finite element (SFE)
method, which is widely used when modelling structures that have material and
loading uncertainties imposed. Such models can be calibrated according to data
from the structure and would be expected to outperform any other model if the
modelling accurately captures the true underlying physics of the structure. The
potential use of SFE models as digital mirrors is illustrated via application
to a linear structure with stochastic material properties. For situations where
the physical formulation of such models does not suffice, a data-driven
framework is proposed, using machine learning and conditional generative
adversarial networks (cGANs). The latter algorithm is used to learn the
distribution of the quantity of interest in a structure with material
nonlinearities and uncertainties. For the examples considered in this work, the
data-driven cGANs model outperform the physics-based approach. Finally, an
example is shown where the two methods are coupled such that a hybrid model
approach is demonstrated.

semi-circular with a uniform cross-sectional area. However, observed loops are
rarely semi-circular, and extrapolations of the magnetic field show that the
field strength decreases with height, implying that the cross-sectional area
expands with height. We examine these two assumptions directly to understand
how they affect the hydrodynamic and radiative response of short, hot loops to
strong, impulsive electron beam heating events. Both the magnitude and rate of
area expansion impact the dynamics directly, and an expanding cross-section
significantly lengthens the time for a loop to cool and drain, increases upflow
durations, and suppresses sound waves. The standard $T \sim n^{2}$ relation for
radiative cooling does not hold with expanding loops, which cool with
relatively little draining. An increase in the eccentricity of loops, on the
other hand, only increases the draining timescale, and is a minor effect in
general. Spectral line intensities are also strongly impacted by the variation
in the cross-sectional area since they depend on both the volume of the
emitting region as well as the density and ionization state. With a larger
expansion, the density is reduced, so the lines at all heights are relatively
reduced in intensity and, because of the increase of cooling times, the hottest
lines remain bright for significantly longer. Area expansion is critical to
accurate modeling of the hydrodynamics and radiation, and observations are
needed to constrain the magnitude, rate, and location of the expansion or lack
thereof.

similar level of capabilities to extract data-centric insights. Manual
stratification of tabular data per a feature (e.g., gender) is limited to scale
up for higher feature dimension, which could be addressed using automatic
discovery of divergent subgroups. Nonetheless, these automatic discovery
techniques often search across potentially exponential combinations of features
that could be simplified using a preceding feature selection step. Existing
feature selection techniques for tabular data often involve fitting a
particular model in order to select important features. However, such
model-based selection is prone to model-bias and spurious correlations in
addition to requiring extra resource to design, fine-tune and train a model. In
this paper, we propose a model-free and sparsity-based automatic feature
selection (SAFS) framework to facilitate automatic discovery of divergent
subgroups. Different from filter-based selection techniques, we exploit the
sparsity of objective measures among feature values to rank and select
features. We validated SAFS across two publicly available datasets (MIMIC-III

methods. SAFS achieves a reduction of feature selection time by a factor of 81x

competitive detection performance, e.g., 18.3% of features selected by SAFS in
the Claims dataset detected divergent samples similar to those detected by
using the whole features with a Jaccard similarity of 0.95 but with a 16x

  Space Diagnostics of Short Intense Charged Particle Beams","contribution to Snowmass 2021",,,,"physics.acc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As charged particle bunches become shorter and more intense, the effects of
nonlinear intra-bunch collective interactions such as space charge forces and
bunch-to-bunch influences such as wakefields and coherent synchrotron radiation
also increase. Shorter more intense bunches are also more difficult to
accurately image because their dimensions are beyond the resolution of existing
diagnostics and they may be destructive to intercepting diagnostics. The
limited availability of detailed diagnostics for intense high energy beams is a
fundamental challenge for the accelerator community because both beams and
accelerators are time-varying systems that change in unpredictable ways. The
detailed 6D (x,y,z,px,py,pz) distributions of beams emerging from sources vary
with time due to factors such as evolving photocathode laser intensity profiles
and the quantum efficiency of photocathodes. Accelerator magnets, RF
amplifiers, and control systems are perturbed by external disturbances,
beam-loading effects, temperature variations, and misalignments. Although
machine learning (ML) methods have grown in popularity in the accelerator
community in recently years, they are fundamentally limited when it comes to
time-varying systems for which most current approaches are to simply collect
large new data sets and perform re-training, something which is not feasible
for busy accelerator user facilities because detailed beam measurements usually
interrupt operations. New adaptive machine learning (AML) methods designed for
time-varying systems are needed to aid in the diagnostics and control of
high-intensity, ultrashort beams by combining deep learning tools such as
convolutional neural network-based encoder-decoder architectures,
model-independent feedback, physics constraints, and online models with real
time non-invasive beam data, to provide a detailed virtual view of intense
bunch dynamics.

to be challenging to study, yet crucial to a model's interpretability and
reliability. This work presents a general algebraic technique to investigate
identifiability of complicated discrete models with latent and graphical
components. Specifically, motivated by diagnostic tests collecting multivariate
categorical data, we focus on discrete models with multiple binary latent
variables. In the considered model, the latent variables can have arbitrary
dependencies among themselves while the latent-to-observed measurement graph
takes a ""star-forest"" shape. We establish necessary and sufficient graphical
criteria for identifiability, and reveal an interesting and perhaps surprising
phenomenon of blessing-of-dependence geometry: under the minimal conditions for
generic identifiability, the parameters are identifiable if and only if the
latent variables are not statistically independent. Thanks to this theory, we
can perform formal hypothesis tests of identifiability in the boundary case by
testing certain marginal independence of the observed variables. Our results
give new understanding of statistical properties of graphical models with
latent variables. They also entail useful implications for designing diagnostic
tests or surveys that measure binary latent traits.

Unfortunately, changing $\varphi$ by varying an external parameter,

unless one uses thermosensitive colloidal particles, like the popular
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAM) microgels. These however have several
drawbacks, including high deformability, osmotic deswelling and
interpenetration, which complicate their use as a model system to study the
colloidal glass transition. Here, we propose a new system consisting of a
colloidal suspension of non-deformable spherical silica nanoparticles, in which
PNiPAM hydrogel spheres of ~$100-200 \mu m$ size are suspended. These
non-colloidal `mesogels' allow for controlling the sample volume effectively
available to the silica nanoparticles and hence their $\varphi$, thanks to the
$T$-induced change in mesogels volume. Using optical microscopy, we first show
that the mesogels retain their ability to change size with $T$ when suspended
in Ludox suspensions, similarly as in water. We then show that their size is
independent of the sample thermal history, such that a well-defined, reversible
relationship between $T$ and $\varphi$ may be established. Finally, we use
space-resolved dynamic light scattering to demonstrate that, upon varying $T$,
our system exhibits a broad range of dynamical behaviors across the glass

ability to operate at low bitrate. However, they do not produce the same level

rely on objective and short-term metrics such as the segmental signal-to-noise
ratio that correlate only weakly with perception. Furthermore, standard codecs
are less efficient than unsupervised neural networks at capturing speech
attributes, especially long-term ones. The proposed method combines a
cognitive-coding encoder that extracts an interpretable unsupervised

how to effectively predict brain cancer survival from the incomplete

Unfortunately, the pose predictions are typically outlier-corrupted, and it is

a 45 degree-long trailing stellar debris stream associated with the old,
metal-poor globular cluster NGC 7089. With a width on the order of 100 pc, the
extended stream appears to be as dynamically cold as the coldest known streams
found to date. There is some evidence for an extended leading tail extending
between 28 and 37 degrees from the cluster, though the greater distance of this
tail, combined with proper motions that are virtually indistinguishable from
those of foreground stars, make the detection much less certain. The proper
motion profile and the path on the sky of the trailing tail are not well
matched using a simple Galactic potential comprised purely of a disk, bulge,
and spherical halo. However, the addition of a moving, massive (M = 1.88 x
10^(11) solar masses) Large Magellanic Cloud brings the model predictions into
much better agreement with the observables. We provide tables of the most
highly ranked candidate stream stars for follow-up by ongoing and future

Unfortunately, as state-of-the-art WF attacks increasingly rely on deep

importance weighting) separately for each group of local random variables. We
show that our approach naturally allows the use of subsampling to get unbiased

Since subspaces correspond to points on a Grassmann manifold, one is led to
consider the idea of a subspace prototype for a Grassmann-valued dataset. While
a number of different subspace prototypes have been described, the calculation
of some of these prototypes has proven to be computationally expensive while
other prototypes are affected by outliers and produce highly imperfect
clustering on noisy data. This work proposes a new subspace prototype, the flag
median, and introduces the FlagIRLS algorithm for its calculation. We provide
evidence that the flag median is robust to outliers and can be used effectively

computing prototypes on the Grassmannian, namely, the $\ell_2$-median and to
the flag mean. We find that using FlagIRLS to compute the flag median converges

We calculate the bubble nucleation in thin-wall approximation, treating the

turbulent diffusivities, non-adiabatic stratification, differential rotation,

compressible fluid inside a spherical shell. We identify modes in the inertial
frequency range including the columnar convective modes, as well as modes of
mixed character. The corresponding mode dispersion relations and eigenfunctions
are computed for azimuthal orders $m \leq 16$. The three main results are as
follows. Firstly, we find that, for $m \gtrsim 5$, the radial dependence of the
equatorial Rossby modes with no radial node ($n=0$) is radically changed from
the traditional expectation ($r^m$) for turbulent diffusivities $\gtrsim
10^{12}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Secondly, we find mixed modes, i.e. modes that share
properties of the equatorial Rossby modes with one radial node ($n=1$) and the
columnar convective modes. Thirdly, we show that the $m=1$ high-latitude mode
in the model is consistent with the solar observations when the latitudinal
entropy gradient corresponding to a thermal wind balance is included
(baroclinally unstable mode). To our knowledge, this work is the first
realistic eigenvalue calculation of the global modes of the rotating solar
convection zone. This calculation reveals a rich spectrum of modes in the
inertial frequency range, which can be directly compared to the observations.
In turn, the observed modes can inform us about the solar convection zone.

a novel Bayesian training loss based on per-utterance Dirichlet prior
distributions is proposed for verbal emotion recognition, which models the
uncertainty in one-hot labels created when human annotators assign the same
utterance to different emotion classes. An additional metric is used to
evaluate the performance by detection test utterances with high labelling
uncertainty. This removes a major limitation that emotion classification
systems only consider utterances with labels where the majority of annotators
agree on the emotion class. Furthermore, a frequentist approach is studied to
leverage the continuous-valued ""soft"" labels obtained by averaging the one-hot
labels. We propose a two-branch model structure for emotion classification on a

considerable attention in academic literature. However, the performance of such

we explore contrastive representation learning methods on the task of
imagery-based city classification, an important problem in urban computing. We
use satellite and map imagery across 2 domains, 3 million locations and more
than 1500 cities. We show that self-supervised methods can build a
generalizable representation from as few as 200 cities, with representations
achieving over 95\% accuracy in unseen cities with minimal additional training.
We also find that the performance discrepancy of such methods, when compared to
supervised methods, induced by the domain discrepancy between natural imagery

reveals the surprising coexistence of multiple types of nematicity that are

the clustering in the hole doped data is consistent with long range order of a

the potential to enhance understanding of symmetry breaking and its spatial

distance-based OOD detection, where testing samples are detected as OOD if they
are relatively far away from the centroids or prototypes of in-distribution

losses that suffice for classifying ID samples, but are not optimally designed
when test inputs contain OOD samples. In this work, we propose CIDER, a novel

separability: a dispersion loss that promotes large angular distances among
different class prototypes, and a compactness loss that encourages samples to
be close to their class prototypes. We analyze and establish the unexplored
relationship between OOD detection performance and the embedding properties in
the hyperspherical space, and demonstrate the importance of dispersion and

aggregated into return distributions using kernel regression. We apply two risk

multivariate and functional data, is still under-explored in temporal point
processes. Recent studies on point process depth proposed a weighted product of
two terms - one indicates the depth of the cardinality of the process, and the
other characterizes the conditional depth of the temporal events given the
cardinality. The second term is of great challenge because of the apparent
nonlinear structure of event times, and so far only basic parametric
representations such as Gaussian and Dirichlet densities were adopted in the
definitions. However, these simplified forms ignore the underlying distribution
of the process events, which makes the methods difficult to interpret and to
apply to complicated patterns. To deal with these problems, we in this paper
propose a distribution-based approach to the conditional depth via the
well-known Isometric Log-Ratio (ILR) transformation on the inter-event times.
The new depth, called the ILR depth, is at first defined for homogeneous
Poisson process by using the density function on the transformed space. The
definition is then extended to any general point process via a time-rescaling
transformation. We illustrate the ILR depth using simulations of Poisson and
non-Poisson processes and demonstrate its superiority over previous methods. We
also thoroughly examine its mathematical properties and asymptotics in large
samples. Finally, we apply the ILR depth in a real dataset and the result
clearly shows the effectiveness of the new method.

assign predicted questions to references before scoring the assigned pairs. We
show that our proposed evaluation strategy has better theoretical and practical

coverage of references. Second, we compare different strategies to utilize a
pre-trained seq2seq model to generate and select a set of questions related to
a given paragraph. The code is available.

larger -- even if the resulting models are overparameterized. Nevertheless,
carefully removing such excess parameters before, during, or after training may
also produce models with similar or even improved accuracy. In many cases, that
can be curiously achieved by heuristics as simple as removing a percentage of

perfect proxy for weight relevance. With the premise that obtaining
significantly better performance from pruning depends on accounting for the
combined effect of removing multiple weights, we revisit one of the classic
approaches for impact-based pruning: the Optimal Brain Surgeon(OBS). We propose
a tractable heuristic for solving the combinatorial extension of OBS, in which
we select weights for simultaneous removal, as well as a systematic update of
the remaining weights. Our selection method outperforms other methods under
high sparsity, and the weight update is advantageous even when combined with

artificial intelligence, multimedia, and signal processing. However, existing
methods usually consider an input video as a whole and learn models, e.g.,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with coarse video-level class labels.
These methods can only output an action class for the video, but cannot provide
fine-grained and explainable cues to answer why the video shows a specific
action. Therefore, researchers start to focus on a new task, Part-level Action
Parsing (PAP), which aims to not only predict the video-level action but also
recognize the frame-level fine-grained actions or interactions of body parts
for each person in the video. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine
framework for this challenging task. In particular, our framework first
predicts the video-level class of the input video, then localizes the body
parts and predicts the part-level action. Moreover, to balance the accuracy and
computation in part-level action parsing, we propose to recognize the
part-level actions by segment-level features. Furthermore, to overcome the
ambiguity of body parts, we propose a pose-guided positional embedding method
to accurately localize body parts. Through comprehensive experiments on a
large-scale dataset, i.e., Kinetics-TPS, our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing methods over a 31.10% ROC

established, the same is not true for electrons in magnetic fields. In this
work, we develop an analytically solvable model describing the transition from
ballistic to hydrodynamic transport with changing the strength of
electron-electron collisions in magnetic fields. Within this model, we find an
expression for the high-frequency non-local conductivity tensor of 2d
electrons. It is valid at arbitrary relation between frequency of external

supports a single magnetoplasmon mode that is not split at cyclotron harmonics.

develops splittings at cyclotron harmonics, forming the Bernstein modes. A

various fascinating physical properties and have sparked intensively research
interest. Here, we performed systematic magnetotransport measurements on
mechanical exfoliation prepared ZrTe2 nanoplates. We revealed that the negative
longitudinal magnetoresistivity observed at high field region in the presence
of parallel electric and magnetic fields could stem from the conductivity
fluctuations due to the excess Zr in the nanoplates. In addition, the
parametric plot, the planar Hall resistivity as function of the in-plane
anisotropic magnetoresistivity, has an ellipse-shaped pattern with shifted
orbital center, which further strengthen the evidence for the conductivity
fluctuations. Our work provides some useful insights into transport phenomena
in topological materials.

Large difference of $|{\alpha}-e|>0.6$ has been experimentally demonstrated
under a moderate external magnetic field. Moreover, based on magnetized ENZ
building blocks supporting asymmetrically radiative Berreman and surface ENZ

single-band, dual-band, and broadband nonreciprocal emission spectra at
different wavebands. Our findings of breaking Kirchhoff's law will advance the
conventional understanding of emission and absorption processes of natural

equilibrium is proved to have nice features in a large market or when it is a

inefficiency, or instability in general cases, we introduce a price regulation
policy to avoid market power exploitation. The improved energy sharing
mechanism with price regulation can guarantee existence and uniqueness of a
socially near-optimal market equilibrium. Some advantageous properties are
proved, such as prosumer's individual rationality, a sharing price structure

  Translation","Submitted to Computational Linguistics",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Active learning can play an important role in low-resource settings (i.e.,
where annotated data is scarce), by selecting which instances may be more
worthy to annotate. Most active learning approaches for Machine Translation
assume the existence of a pool of sentences in a source language, and rely on
human annotators to provide translations or post-edits, which can still be
costly. In this article, we assume a real world human-in-the-loop scenario in
which: (i) the source sentences may not be readily available, but instead
arrive in a stream; (ii) the automatic translations receive feedback in the
form of a rating, instead of a correct/edited translation, since the
human-in-the-loop might be a user looking for a translation, but not be able to
provide one. To tackle the challenge of deciding whether each incoming pair
source-translations is worthy to query for human feedback, we resort to a
number of stream-based active learning query strategies. Moreover, since we not
know in advance which query strategy will be the most adequate for a certain
language pair and set of Machine Translation models, we propose to dynamically
combine multiple strategies using prediction with expert advice. Our
experiments show that using active learning allows to converge to the best
Machine Translation systems with fewer human interactions. Furthermore,
combining multiple strategies using prediction with expert advice often
outperforms several individual active learning strategies with even fewer
interactions.

this paper, incorporating the nonideal effect into the linear interpolation

complex mechanisms. Current quantitative causal models rely on one or more
assumptions: (1) the climate drivers persistently generate conflict, (2) the
causal mechanisms have a linear relationship with the conflict generation
parameter, and/or (3) there is sufficient data to inform the prior
distribution. Yet, we know conflict drivers often excite a social
transformation process which leads to violence (e.g., drought forces
agricultural producers to join urban militia), but further climate effects do
not necessarily contribute to further violence. Therefore, not only is this
bifurcation relationship highly non-linear, there is also often a lack of data
to support prior assumptions for high resolution modeling. Here, we aim to
overcome the aforementioned causal modeling challenges by proposing a neural
forward-intensity Poisson process (NFIPP) model. The NFIPP is designed to
capture the potential non-linear causal mechanism in climate induced political
violence, whilst being robust to sparse and timing-uncertain data. Our results
span 20 recent years and reveal an excitation-based causal link between extreme
climate events and political violence across diverse countries. Our
climate-induced conflict model results are cross-validated against qualitative
climate vulnerability indices. Furthermore, we label historical events that
either improve or reduce our predictability gain, demonstrating the importance
of domain expertise in informing interpretation.

Because of integer decision variables, as the problem size increases, the

drastic increase in the computational effort. To efficiently solve MILP
problems, a ""price-based"" decomposition and coordination approach is developed
to exploit 1. the super-linear reduction of complexity upon the decomposition
and 2. the geometric convergence potential inherent to Polyak's stepsizing
formula for the fastest coordination possible to obtain near-optimal solutions
in a computationally efficient manner. Unlike all previous methods to set
stepsizes heuristically by adjusting hyperparameters, the key novel way to
obtain stepsizes is purely decision-based: a novel ""auxiliary"" constraint
satisfaction problem is solved, from which the appropriate stepsizes are
inferred. Testing results for large-scale Generalized Assignment Problems (GAP)
demonstrate that for the majority of instances, certifiably optimal solutions
are obtained. For stochastic job-shop scheduling as well as for pharmaceutical

synthesis of functionalized 3-carbophene more creditable. The type of
carbophene, type of functional group, and the degree of functionalization all
play a role in the band structure of the materials. For example, CO functional
groups may lead to a mid-gap state pinned to the Fermi level, whereas the other
functional groups studied keep the semiconducting nature of pristine
carbophene. Thus, because carbonyl functional groups are often present in
defected carbon systems, care should be taken to limit the amount of oxygen in
carbophene devices where the band gap is important. Thus, this work strengthens
the hypothesis of Junkermeier et al.'s hypothesis that Du et al. synthesized
3-carbophene and not graphenylene.

first time. In contrast to EOSs with purely hadronic matter or with a
first-order quark-hadron phase transition (1PT), in the transition region QHC
EOSs show a peak in sound speed, and thus a stiffening. We study the effects of
such stiffening in the merger and post-merger gravitational (GW) signals.
Through simulations in the binary-mass range $2.5 < M/M_{\odot} < 2.75$,
characteristic differences due to different EOSs appear in the frequency of the
main peak of the post-merger GW spectrum ($f_2$), extracted through Bayesian
inference. In particular, we found that (i) for lower-mass binaries, since the
maximum baryon number density ($n_{\rm max}$) after the merger stays below
$3\text{--}4$ times the nuclear-matter density ($n_0$), the characteristic
stiffening of the QHC models in that density range results in a lower $f_2$
than that computed for the underlying hadronic EOS and thus also than that for
EOSs with a 1PT, (ii) for higher-mass binaries, where $n_{\rm max}$ may exceed
$4\text{--}5 n_0$ depending on the EOS model, whether $f_2$ in QHC models is
higher or lower than that in the underlying hadronic model depends on the
height of the sound-speed peak. Comparing the values of $f_2$ for different
EOSs and BNS masses gives important clues on how to discriminate different
types of quark dynamics in the high-density end of EOSs and is relevant to
future kilohertz GW observations with third-generation GW detectors.

Our study provides perfectly rational explanations of the physics behind the

series, where we define a time series to be a one-dimensional polygonal curve.
The drawback of Dynamic Time Warping is that it is sensitive to the sampling
rate of the time series. The Fr\'echet distance is an alternative that has
gained popularity, however, its drawback is that it is sensitive to outliers.
  Continuous Dynamic Time Warping (CDTW) is a recently proposed alternative
that does not exhibit the aforementioned drawbacks. CDTW combines the
continuous nature of the Fr\'echet distance with the summation of Dynamic Time
Warping, resulting in a similarity measure that is robust to sampling rate and
to outliers. In a recent experimental work of Brankovic et al., it was
demonstrated that clustering under CDTW avoids the unwanted artifacts that
appear when clustering under Dynamic Time Warping and under the Fr\'echet
distance. Despite its advantages, the major shortcoming of CDTW is that there
is no exact algorithm for computing CDTW, in polynomial time or otherwise.
  In this work, we present the first exact algorithm for computing CDTW of
one-dimensional curves. Our algorithm runs in time $O(n^5)$ for a pair of
one-dimensional curves, each with complexity at most $n$. In our algorithm, we
propagate continuous functions in the dynamic program for CDTW, where the main
difficulty lies in bounding the complexity of the functions. We believe that
our result is an important first step towards CDTW becoming a practical
similarity measure between curves.

most of the information in data dimension to let $d < n$. The data with $n \ll
d$ is referred to as high-dimensional low sample size (HDLSS). {}To deal with
HDLSS problems, a method called high-dimensional statistics has been developed
rapidly in the last decade. In this work, we first introduce the
high-dimensional statistical analysis to the astronomical community. We apply
two representative methods in the high-dimensional statistical analysis
methods, the noise-reduction principal component analysis (NRPCA) and
regularized principal component analysis (RPCA), to a spectroscopic map of a
nearby archetype starburst galaxy NGC 253 taken by the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ALMA map is a typical HDLSS dataset.
First we analyzed the original data including the Doppler shift due to the
systemic rotation. The high-dimensional PCA could describe the spatial
structure of the rotation precisely. We then applied to the Doppler-shift
corrected data to analyze more subtle spectral features. The NRPCA and RPCA
could quantify the very complicated characteristics of the ALMA spectra.
Particularly, we could extract the information of the global outflow from the
center of NGC 253. This method can also be applied not only to spectroscopic
survey data, but also any type of data with small sample size and large

indistinguishability, the goal of the learner is to output a predictor that
cannot be distinguished from the target predictor by a class $D$ of
distinguishers examining the outcomes generated according to the predictors'
predictions.
  In the distribution-specific and realizable setting where the learner is
given the data distribution together with a predictor class $P$ containing the
target predictor, we show that the sample complexity of outcome
indistinguishability is characterized by the metric entropy of $P$ w.r.t. the
dual Minkowski norm defined by $D$, and equivalently by the metric entropy of
$D$ w.r.t. the dual Minkowski norm defined by $P$. This equivalence makes an
intriguing connection to the long-standing metric entropy duality conjecture in
convex geometry. Our sample complexity characterization implies a variant of
metric entropy duality, which we show is nearly tight. In the distribution-free
setting, we focus on the case considered by Dwork et al. where $P$ contains all
possible predictors, hence the sample complexity only depends on $D$. In this
setting, we show that the sample complexity of outcome indistinguishability is
characterized by the fat-shattering dimension of $D$.
  We also show a strong sample complexity separation between realizable and
agnostic outcome indistinguishability in both the distribution-free and the
distribution-specific settings. This is in contrast to distribution-free (resp.
distribution-specific) PAC learning where the sample complexity in both the
realizable and the agnostic settings can be characterized by the VC dimension

First, based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), an improved sample-based
algorithm called Plane Fitting RRT* (PF-RRT*) is proposed to obtain a sparse
trajectory. Each sampling point corresponds to a custom traversability index
and a fitted plane on the point cloud. These planes are connected in series to
form a traversable strip. Second, Gaussian Process Regression is used to
generate traversability of the dense trajectory interpolated from the sparse
trajectory, and the sampling tree is used as the training set. Finally, local
planning is performed using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). By
adding the traversability index and uncertainty to the cost function, and
adding obstacles generated by the real-time point cloud to the constraint

focusing on the ""potentiality of input neurons"" and can identify which inputs
are significantly utilized by the network. Using the full advantage of PL, we
extracted the influential solar wind parameters that disturb the magnetosphere
under southward Interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. The input
parameters of PL were the three components of the IMF (Bx, By, -Bz(Bs)), solar
wind flow speed (Vx), and proton number density (Np) in geocentric solar
ecliptic (GSE) coordinates obtained from the OMNI solar wind database between
1998 and 2019. Furthermore, we classified these input parameters into two
groups (targets), depending on the Kp level: Kp = 6- to 9 (positive target) and
Kp = 0 to 1+ (negative target). Negative target samples were randomly selected
to ensure that numbers of positive and negative targets were equal. The PL
results revealed that solar wind flow speed is an influential parameter for
increasing Kp under southward IMF conditions, which was in good agreement with
previous reports on the statistical relationship between the Kp index and solar
wind velocity, and the Kp formulation based on the IMF and solar wind plasma
parameters. Based on this new neural network, we aim to construct a more
correct and parameter-dependent space weather forecasting model.

acquired CSI, the closed-form expressions for downlink achievable rates with
maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) and MMSE beamforming are
derived. Based on these expressions, we propose an efficient power allocation
scheme by solving a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) between
maximizing the minimum spectral efficiency (SE) of multicast users and
maximizing the average SE of unicast users with non-dominated sorting genetic

computational efficiency. Numerical results verify the accuracy of the derived

inference is underpinned by information criteria (IC) and cross-validation (CV)
techniques. Although IC techniques, such as Akaike's Information Criterion,
have been historically more popular in ecology, CV is a versatile and
increasingly used alternative. CV uses data splitting to estimate model scores
based on (out-of-sample) predictive performance, which can be used even when it
is not possible to derive a likelihood (e.g., machine learning) or count
parameters precisely (e.g., mixed-effects models and penalised regression).
Here we provide a primer to understanding and applying CV in ecology. We review
commonly applied variants of CV, including approximate methods, and make
recommendations for their use based on the statistical context. We explain some
important -- but often overlooked -- technical aspects of CV, such as bias
correction, estimation uncertainty, score selection, and parsimonious selection
rules. We also address misconceptions (and truths) about impediments to the use
of CV, including computational cost and ease of implementation, and clarify the
relationship between CV and information-theoretic approaches to model
selection. The paper includes two ecological case studies which illustrate the
application of the techniques. We conclude that CV-based model selection should
be widely applied to ecological analyses, because of its robust estimation
properties and the broad range of situations for which it is applicable. In
particular, we recommend using leave-one-out (LOO) or approximate LOO CV to
minimise bias, or otherwise K-fold CV using bias correction if K<10. To
mitigate overfitting, we recommend calibrated selection via the modified
one-standard-error rule which accounts for the predominant cause of
overfitting: score-estimation uncertainty.

simplify the data analysis, it could potentially involve difficulties with
regards to statistical inference and interpretation. In this sense, a joint

to jointly analyze ratings and response times by means of fuzzy numbers. A
probabilistic tree model framework has been adopted to fuzzify ratings data and
four-parameter triangular fuzzy numbers have been used in order to integrate
crisp responses and times. Finally, a real case study on psychometric data is
discussed in order to illustrate the proposed methodology. Overall, we provide
initial findings to the problem of using fuzzy numbers as abstract models for
representing ratings data with additional information (i.e., response times).
The results indicate that using fuzzy numbers lead to theoretically sound and
more parsimonious data analysis methods, which limit some statistical issues

irrelevant to those in the target video domain. With the increasing emphasis on
data privacy, such methods that require source data access would raise serious
privacy issues. Therefore, to cope with such concern, a more practical domain
adaptation scenario is formulated as the Source-Free Video-based Domain
Adaptation (SFVDA). Though there are a few methods for Source-Free Domain

in SFVDA due to the multi-modality nature of videos, with the existence of

success in training with few annotations. However, confirmation bias increases
dramatically as the number of annotations decreases making it difficult to
continue reducing the number of annotations. Based on the observation that the
quality of pseudo-labels early in semi-supervised training plays an important
role in mitigating confirmation bias, in this paper we propose an active
self-semi-supervised learning (AS3L) framework. AS3L bootstraps semi-supervised

propagation over self-supervised features. We illustrate that the accuracy of
PPL is not only affected by the quality of features, but also by the selection
of the labeled samples. We develop active learning and label propagation
strategies to obtain better PPL. Consequently, our framework can significantly
improve the performance of models in the case of few annotations while reducing
the training time. Experiments on four semi-supervised learning benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our method outperforms
the baseline method by an average of 7\% on the four datasets and outperforms

UltraViolet (LUV), a novel framework that enables rapid, labeled data
collection in real manipulation environments without human labeling. LUV uses
transparent, ultraviolet-fluorescent paint with programmable ultraviolet LEDs
to collect paired images of a scene in standard lighting and UV lighting to
autonomously extract segmentation masks and keypoints via color segmentation.
We apply LUV to a suite of diverse robot perception tasks to evaluate its
labeling quality, flexibility, and data collection rate. Results suggest that
LUV is 180-2500 times faster than a human labeler across the tasks. We show
that LUV provides labels consistent with human annotations on unpainted test

crumpled towels with 83% success rate and achieve 1.7mm position error with

local features and global dependencies separately, then a sequence-to-volume

whether to label it and use it for training or to discard it. There are
numerous active learning strategies which try to minimize the number of labeled
samples required for training in this setting by identifying and retaining the
most informative data samples. Most of these schemes are rule-based and rely on
the notion of uncertainty, which captures how small the distance of a data
sample is from the classifier's decision boundary. Recently, there have been
some attempts to learn optimal selection strategies directly from the data, but
many of them are still lacking generality for several reasons: 1) They focus on
specific classification setups, 2) They rely on rule-based metrics, 3) They
require offline pre-training of the active learner on related tasks. In this

  This paper proposes a novel equilibrium-independent transient stability
analysis of distribution systems with lossy lines. We certify network-level
stability by breaking the network into subsystems, and by looking at the
equilibrium-independent passivity of each subsystem, the network stability is
certified through a diagonal stability property of the interconnection matrix.
This allows the analysis scale to large networked systems with time-varying
equilibria. The proposed method gracefully extrapolates between lossless and
lossy systems, and provides a simple yet effective approach to optimize control
efforts with guaranteed stability regions. Case studies verify that the
proposed method is much less conservative than existing approaches and also

of single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei. The density dependence is taken in both
meson-nucleon and meson-hyperon coupling strengths, and the induced
$\Lambda$-nucleon ($\Lambda N$) effective interactions are determined by
fitting $\Lambda$ separation energies to the experimental data for several
single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei. The equilibrium of nuclear dynamics described by
the RHF model in normal atomic nuclei, namely, the balance between nuclear
attractive and repulsive interactions, is then found to be drastically changed
in single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei, revealing a different role of Fock terms via
$\Lambda$ hyperon from the nucleon exchange. Since only one hyperon exists in a
single-$\Lambda$ hypernucleus, the overwhelmed $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda\Lambda$
attractions via the Hartree than the $\Lambda\Lambda$ repulsion from the Fock
terms require an alternation of meson-hyperon coupling strengths in RHF to
rebalance the effective nuclear force with the strangeness degree of freedom,
leading to an improved description of $\Lambda$ Dirac mass and correspondingly
a systematically reduced $\sigma$-$\Lambda$ coupling strength
$g_{\sigma\Lambda}$ in current models as compared to those relativistic
mean-field (RMF) approaches without Fock terms. As a result, the effective
$\Lambda$ spin-orbit coupling potential in the ground state of hypernuclei is
suppressed, and these RHF models predict correspondingly a quenching effect in
$\Lambda$ spin-orbit splitting in comparison with the RMF cases. Furthermore,
the $\Lambda$ spin-orbit splitting could decrease efficiently by evolving the
hyperon-relevant couplings $g_{\sigma\Lambda}$ and $g_{\omega\Lambda}$

quality of Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. In a polychromatic X-ray beam,
since low-energy photons are more preferentially absorbed, the attenuation of
the beam is no longer a linear function of the absorber thickness. The existing
BH correction methods either require a given material, which might be
unfeasible in reality, or they require a long computation time. This work aims
to propose a fast and accurate BH correction method that requires no prior
knowledge of the materials and corrects first and higher-order BH artifacts. In
the first step, a wide sweep of the material is performed based on an
experimentally measured look-up table to obtain the closest estimate of the
material. Then the non-linearity effect of the BH is corrected by adding the
difference between the estimated monochromatic and the polychromatic simulated
projections of the segmented image. The estimated monochromatic projection is
simulated by selecting the energy from the polychromatic spectrum which
produces the lowest mean square error (MSE) with the acquired projection from
the scanner. The polychromatic projection is estimated by minimizing the
difference between the acquired projection and the weighted sum of the
simulated polychromatic projections using different spectra of different
filtration. To evaluate the proposed BH correction method, we have conducted
extensive experiments on the real-world CT data. Compared to the
state-of-the-art empirical BH correction method, the experiments show that the

displays yield-stress behaviour, with the droplets remaining motionless when
the applied body-force is below a critical value. In the non-flowing phase,
droplets jam to form an amorphous structure, whereas they order in the flowing
phase. Yielding is linked to a percolation transition in the contacts of
droplet-droplet overlaps, and requires suitable wetting boundary conditions and
strict conservation of the droplet area to exist. Close to the yielding
transition, we find strong oscillations in the droplet motion which closely
resemble those found experimentally in confined colloidal glasses under flow.
We show that even when droplets are static the underlying solvent moves by
permeation, so that the viscosity of the composite system is never truly
infinite, and, as we discuss, its precise value ceases to be a bulk material

raises challenges for us to best leverage pretrained models in DG tasks. In
this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization paradigm to better
leverage various pretrained models, named specialized ensemble learning for
domain generalization (SEDGE). It first trains a linear label space adapter
upon fixed pretrained models, which transforms the outputs of the pretrained
model to the label space of the target domain. Then, an ensemble network aware

$e$. We prove that if $X$ has rational singularities, then $\text{reg}(X) \leq
d-e+2$. Our bound is very close to a sharp bound conjectured by Eisenbud-Goto.
When $e=2$ and $X$ has Cohen-Macaulay Du Bois singularities, we obtain the
conjectured bound $\text{reg}(X) \leq d-1$, and we also classify the extremal
cases. To achieve these results, we bound the regularity of fibers of a generic

a high-dimensional factor component. The conventional approach to retrieving
the smooth function from the raw data is through various smoothing techniques.
However, the smoothing model is inadequate to recover the smooth curve or
capture the data variation in some situations. These include cases where there
is a large amount of measurement error, the smoothing basis functions are
incorrectly identified, or the step jumps in the functional mean levels are
neglected. A factor-augmented smoothing model is proposed to address these
challenges, and an iterative numerical estimation approach is implemented in
practice. Including the factor model component in the proposed method solves
the aforementioned problems since a few common factors often drive the
variation that cannot be captured by the smoothing model. Asymptotic theorems
are also established to demonstrate the effects of including factor structures
on the smoothing results. Specifically, we show that the smoothing coefficients
projected on the complement space of the factor loading matrix are
asymptotically normal. As a byproduct of independent interest, an estimator for
the population covariance matrix of the raw data is presented based on the
proposed model. Extensive simulation studies illustrate that these factor
adjustments are essential in improving estimation accuracy and avoiding the
curse of dimensionality. The superiority of our model is also shown in modeling
Australian temperature data.

knowledge of the target model or similar substitute model, nor access the
dataset for training a new substitute model. Although a recent method has
attempted such an attack in a loose sense, its performance is not good enough
and computational overhead of training is expensive. In this paper, we move a
step forward and show the existence of a \textbf{training-free} adversarial
perturbation under the no-box threat model, which can be successfully used to
attack different DNNs in real-time. Motivated by our observation that
high-frequency component (HFC) domains in low-level features and plays a
crucial role in classification, we attack an image mainly by manipulating its
frequency components. Specifically, the perturbation is manipulated by
suppression of the original HFC and adding of noisy HFC. We empirically and
experimentally analyze the requirements of effective noisy HFC and show that it
should be regionally homogeneous, repeating and dense. Extensive experiments on

deployment of robotics or augmented reality applications in any environments,
especially those for which no accurate 3D model nor huge amount of ground truth

reliably detect objects regardless of viewing conditions. Previous works have
also shown that abstracting the geometry of a scene of objects by an ellipsoid
cloud allows to compute the camera pose accurately enough for various
application needs. Though promising, these approaches use the ellipses fitted
to the detection bounding boxes as an approximation of the imaged objects. In
this paper, we go one step further and propose a learning-based method which
detects improved elliptic approximations of objects which are coherent with the
3D ellipsoids in terms of perspective projection. Experiments prove that the
accuracy of the computed pose significantly increases thanks to our method.

propose a universal self-supervised Transformer framework, named Uni4Eye, to

It has already been tested in 1D quasistatic and 2D quasistatic: this paper

The Lip-field approach formulates the mechanical problem to be solved as an
optimization problem, where the incremental potential to be minimized is the
non-regularized one. Spurious localization is prevented by imposing a Lipschitz
constraint on the damage field. The displacement and damage field at each time
step are obtained by a staggered algorithm, that is the displacement field is
computed for a fixed damage field, then the damage field is computed for a
fixed displacement field. Indeed, these two problems are convex, which is not
the case of the global problem where the displacement and damage fields are
sought at the same time. The incremental potential is obtained by equivalence
with a cohesive zone model, which makes material parameters calibration simple.
A non-regularized local damage equivalent to a cohesive zone model is also
proposed. It is used as a reference for the Lip-field approach, without the
need to implement displacement jumps.

different face variations and physical conditions to conduct reproducible
evaluations comprehensively. With this digital simulator, we further propose a
Face3DAdv method considering the 3D face transformations and realistic physical

discretisation of the rotating shallow water equations are studied. These
include the well-known anticipated potential vorticity method (APVM),
streamwise upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method, and a recent approach where
the trial functions are evaluated downstream within the reference element. In
all cases the upwinding scheme conserves both potential vorticity and energy,
since the antisymmetric structure of the equations is preserved. The APVM leads
to a symmetric definite correction to the potential enstrophy that is
dissipative and inconsistent, resulting in a turbulent state where the
potential enstrophy is more strongly damped than for the other schemes. While
the SUPG scheme is widely known to be consistent, since it modifies the test
functions only, the downwinded trial function formulation results in the
advection of downwind corrections. Results of the SUPG and downwinded trial
function schemes are very similar in terms of both potential enstrophy
conservation and turbulent spectra. The main difference between these schemes
is in the energy conservation and residual errors. If just two nonlinear
iterations are applied then the energy conservation errors are improved for the
downwinded trial function formulation, reflecting a smaller residual error than
for the SUPG scheme.
  We also present formulations by which potential enstrophy is exactly
integrated at each time level. Results using these formulations are observed to
be stable in the absence of dissipation, despite the uncontrolled aliasing of
grid scale turbulence. Using such a formulation and the APVM with a coefficient
$\mathcal{O}(100)$ times smaller that its regular value leads to turbulent
spectra that are greatly improved at the grid scale over the SUPG and
downwinded trial function formulations with unstable potential enstrophy
errors.

formation phenomenon was observed: instead of the expected continuous
composition gradient, regions with homogeneous composition and single-phase
structure (La2O3 or stoichiometric La-perovskite) form. This phenomenon occurs
during reactive co-sputtering and is dependent on O2-flux and substrate
temperature, investigated from room temperature up to 700 C and is independent
of the used substrate. It can be described as a self-organized growth, where
excess transition metal cannot be incorporated into the growing film and the
forming single-phase regions. It is hypothesized that due to the high
reactivity of La and the significantly low formation energies of La2O3 and
La-perovskites, the reactive sputter deposition of La-based oxide films can
turn, regarding film growth, into a partial CVD-like process which results in
the unusual self-organized growth of single-phase regions. This phenomenon can
be leveraged for the exploration of multinary perovskite thin film libraries,
where the B-site atoms of La-perovskites are systematically substituted.

$Pf_k(n)\subset {\mathbb K}^{\binom{[n]}2}$ of antisymmetric matrices of rank
$\le 2k$.
  First, we characterize the Gr\""obner cone $Grob_k(n)\subset{\mathbb

Stanley-Reisner ideal of $Ass_k(n)$ (that is, the monomial ideal generated by

relativity (GR) in the strong-field and highly dynamical regime of the theory.
Parametrized tests of GR are one well-known approach for quantifying violations
of GR. This approach constrains deviations in the coefficients of the
post-Newtonian phasing formula, which describes the gravitational-wave phase
evolution of a compact binary as it inspirals. Current bounds from this test
using LIGO/Virgo observations assume that binaries are circularized by the time
they enter the detector frequency band. Here, we investigate the impact of
residual binary eccentricity on the parametrized tests. We study the systematic
biases in the parameter bounds when a phasing based on the circular orbit
assumption is employed for a system that has some small residual eccentricity.
We find that a systematic bias (for example, on the leading Newtonian
deformation parameter) becomes comparable to the statistical errors for even
moderate eccentricities of $\sim 0.04$ at $10$ Hz in LIGO/Virgo band for binary
black holes, and $\sim 0.008$ for binary neutron stars. This happens at even
lower values of orbital eccentricity in the frequency band of third-generation
(3G) detectors like Cosmic Explorer ($\sim 0.005$ at $10$ Hz for binary black
holes and $\sim 0.002$ for binary neutron stars). These results demonstrate
that incorporating physical effects like eccentricity in waveform models is
important for accurately extracting science results from future detectors.

LEBP contains a two-stream process: 1) It first conducts a language expectation
module to generate an expectation describing how to perform tasks by
understanding the language instruction. The expectation consists of a sequence
of sub-steps for the task (e.g., Pick an apple). The expectation allows people
to access and check the understanding results of instructions before the agent
takes actual actions, in case the task might go wrong. 2) Then, it uses the
binding policy module to bind sub-steps in expectation to actual actions to
specific scenarios. Actual actions include navigation and object manipulation.
Experimental results suggest our approach achieves comparable performance to

burn in living or a mixture of living and senescent vegetation. Therefore, it
is necessary to understand the burning behavior of living fuels, in contrast to
just dead or dried fuels, to more effectively support fire management
decisions. In this study, the ignition and burning behaviors of needles placed
in convective heat flux were evaluated. The species included longleaf pine
(Pinus palustris), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western red cedar
(Thuja plicata), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), western larch (Larix
occidentalis), pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), white spruce (Picea glauca), and
sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate). The ignition and burning behaviors were
related to live fuel moisture content (LFMC), pilot flame temperatures, and
convective heat fluxes. The different phases of ignition and burning were
captured using high-speed imaging. In general, four burning phases can be
observed: droplet ejection and burning, a transition phase, flaming combustion,
and smoldering combustion. Ejection and subsequent burning of droplets can
occur prior to sustained flaming ignition only in live fuels. For some species
(e.g., longleaf pine, ponderosa pine, white spruce) droplet ejection and
burning can reduce ignition times relative to dried fuel with lower LFMC. In
general, the transition phase tends to take longer than the flaming and droplet
phases (when these occur). During the transition phase, the fuels are heated
and pyrolysis occurs. Time-scales to ignition and the different phases of
ignition and burning vary more among live fuels than dead and dried fuels. This
conclusion indicates that other parameters, such as chemical composition and
structural morphology of the fuel, can significantly influence the burning of
live fuels.

Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks,

  assemblies","30 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Synaptic connections in neuronal circuits are modulated by pre- and
post-synaptic spiking activity. Heuristic models of this process of synaptic
plasticity can provide excellent fits to results from in-vitro experiments in
which pre- and post-synaptic spiking is varied in a controlled fashion.
However, the plasticity rules inferred from fitting such data are inevitably
unstable, in that given constant pre- and post-synaptic activity the synapse
will either fully potentiate or depress. This instability can be held in check
by adding additional mechanisms, such as homeostasis. Here we consider an
alternative scenario in which the plasticity rule itself is stable. When this
is the case, net potentiation or depression only occur when pre- and
post-synaptic activity vary in time, e.g. when driven by time-varying inputs.
We study how the features of such inputs shape the recurrent synaptic
connections in models of neuronal circuits. In the case of oscillatory inputs,
the resulting structure is strongly affected by the phase relationship between
drive to different neurons. In large networks, distributed phases tend to lead
to hierarchical clustering. Our results may be of relevance for understanding
the effect of sensory-driven inputs, which are by nature time-varying, on
synaptic plasticity, and hence on learning and memory.

awareness of battery degradation costs and how they can be minimized. However,
from a planning perspective it is difficult to integrate battery degradation
models into existing route planning models and to assess how policies that aim
at reducing battery degradation affect route planning costs and degradation
across the fleet. In this paper, a simple transportation vehicle routing
problem (VRP) is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear problem (MINLP), with
a modification that allows monitoring the maximum and minimum
depth-of-discharge (DoD) of the entire fleet. This allows us to measure the
battery health degradation during the online optimization process. The results
show that accounting for the impact of different route characteristics on
battery degradation can have an impact on the route planning of the entire
fleet as well as the battery degradation for all vehicles. The latter is
achieved by forcing vehicles to adapt to certain DoD boundaries in the long
term.

nature of the shear viscosity in water is fully similar to that in argon. The
contribution, caused by interlayer displacements of molecules, is assumed to be
negligibly small. The behavior of the kinematic shear viscosities of water is
investigated in detail in the two characteristic directions: the vapor-liquid
coexistence curve and isotherms. As for argon, it is assumed that the
self-diffusion in water is formed by the two main contributions, caused by the
molecular transport by nano-scale vortex hydrodynamic modes and collective
intermixing of molecules on molecular scales. The mechanism of the second type
is with good accuracy described by the Einstein formula with a hard-core radius

targets were selected in a narrow range of spectral types from M0 to M3, $0.3$
M$_\odot < M_\star < 0.71$ M$_\odot$, in order to study the planetary
population around a well-defined class of host stars. We take advantage of
Bayesian statistics to derive an accurate estimate of the detectability
function of the survey. Our analysis also includes the application of Gaussian

variations, and improve the detection limits, around the most-observed and
most-active targets. The Markov chain Monte Carlo and Gaussian process
technique we apply in this analysis has proven very effective in the study of
M-dwarf planetary systems, helping the detection of most of the HADES planets.
From the detectability function we can calculate the occurrence rate of small
mass planets around early-M dwarfs, either taking into account only the 11
already published HADES planets or adding also the 5 new planetary candidates
discovered in this analysis, and compare them with the previous estimates of
planet occurrence around M-dwarf or Solar-type stars: considering only the
confirmed planets, we find the highest frequency for low-mass planets ($1$
M$_\oplus < m_p \sin i < 10$ M$_\oplus$) with periods $10$ d$ < P < 100$ d,
$f_\text{occ} = 85^{+5}_{-19}\%$, while for short-period planets ($1$ d$ < P <
10$ d) we find a frequency of $f_\text{occ} = 10.3^{+8.4}_{-3.3}\%$,
significantly lower than for later-M dwarfs. These results, and their
comparison with other surveys focused on different stellar types, confirms the
central role that stellar mass plays in the formation and evolution of
planetary systems.

Furthermore, they support only a few output formats. In order to overcome the

term in our estimates decays faster than in all previous works.
  Our estimates imply that the probability that a random polynomial $f_n$ is
$m$-friable is asymptotic to the probability that a random permutation $\pi_n$
is $m$-friable, uniformly for $m\ge (2+\varepsilon)\log_q n$ as $q^n \to

obtain an asymptotic result.

limit the further reduction in sampling rate. The deterministic Hadamard basis

beneficial to further reduce the sampling rate, thus many orderings have
emerged, but their relations remain unclear and lack a unified theory. Given
this, here we specially propose a concept named selection history, which can
record the Hadamard spatial folding process, and build a model based on it to
reveal the formation mechanisms of different orderings and to deduce the mutual
conversion relationship among them. Then, a weight ordering of the Hadamard

calibration patterns and using the detected correspondences to optimize the
parameters of the assumed camera model. A meaningful evaluation of these
methods relies on the availability of realistic synthetic data. In previous
works concerned with conventional cameras the synthetic data was mainly created
by rendering perfect images with a pinhole camera and subsequently adding
distortions and aberrations to the renderings and correspondences according to
the assumed camera model. This method can bias the evaluation since not every
camera perfectly complies with an assumed model. Furthermore, in the field of
plenoptic camera calibration there is no synthetic ground truth data available
at all. We address these problems by proposing a method based on backward ray
tracing to create realistic ground truth data that can be used for an unbiased
evaluation of calibration methods for both types of cameras.

reconstructing images from highly-undersampled multi-coil k-space data
  Methods: DL-Speed, an unrolled optimization architecture with dense
skip-layer connections, was trained on 3D T1-weighted brain scan data to
reconstruct complex-valued images from highly-undersampled k-space data. The
trained model was evaluated on 3D MPRAGE brain scan data
retrospectively-undersampled with a 10-fold acceleration, compared to a
conventional parallel imaging method with a 2-fold acceleration. Scores of SNR,
artifacts, gray/white matter contrast, resolution/sharpness, deep gray-matter,
cerebellar vermis, anterior commissure, and overall quality, on a 5-point
Likert scale, were assessed by experienced radiologists. In addition, the
trained model was tested on retrospectively-undersampled 3D T1-weighted LAVA
(Liver Acquisition with Volume Acceleration) abdominal scan data, and
prospectively-undersampled 3D MPRAGE and LAVA scans in three healthy volunteers
and one, respectively.
  Results: The qualitative scores for DL-Speed with a 10-fold acceleration were
higher than or equal to those for the parallel imaging with 2-fold
acceleration. DL-Speed outperformed a compressed sensing method in quantitative
metrics on retrospectively-undersampled LAVA data. DL-Speed was demonstrated to
perform reasonably well on prospectively-undersampled scan data, realizing a

  Conclusion: DL-Speed was shown to accelerate 3D MPRAGE and LAVA with up to a
net 10-fold acceleration, achieving 2-5 times faster scans compared to
conventional parallel imaging and acceleration, while maintaining diagnostic
image quality and real-time reconstruction. The brain scan data-trained

However, harvesters operate in mature forests, which may introduce selection
biases that can result in systematic errors in harvester data-based forest
attribute maps. We fitted regression models (harvester models) for volume (V),
height (HL), stem frequency (N), above-ground biomass, basal area, and
quadratic mean diameter (QMD) using harvester and ALS data. Performances of the
harvester models were evaluated using national forest inventory plots in an 8.7
Mha study area. We estimated biases of large-area synthetic estimators and
compared efficiencies of model-assisted (MA) estimators with field data-based
direct estimators. The harvester models performed better in productive than
unproductive forests, but systematic errors occurred in both. The use of MA
estimators resulted in efficiency gains that were largest for HL (relative
efficiency, RE=6.0) and smallest for QMD (RE=1.5). The bias of the synthetic
estimator was largest for N (39%) and smallest for V (1%). The latter was due
to an overestimation of deciduous and an underestimation of spruce forests that
by chance balanced. We conclude that a probability sample of reference
observations may be required to ensure the unbiasedness of estimators utilizing
harvester data.

numbers of IoT devices. This paper initially investigates how the current
state-of-the-art protocols operate in such adverse conditions by measuring
various Quality-of-Service (QoS) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the
shared wireless medium. We later discuss how Concurrent Transmissions (CT) can
extend the scalability of IoT protocols and ensure reliable firmware roll-outs
over large geographical areas. Measuring KPIs such as the mesh join time, the
throughput, and the number of nodes forming a network, we provide great insight
into how an IoT environment will behave under a large-scale firmware roll-out.
Finally, we conducted our performance investigation over the UMBRELLA platform,
a real-world IoT testbed deployed in Bristol, UK. This ensures our findings
represent a realistic IoT scenario and meet the strict QoS requirements of
today's IoT applications.

an empirical paradox in which observational studies estimate the benefit of
mask-wearing directives to be five times higher than a randomized controlled

Doppler shifts in a 3D radiation MHD model of the quiet Sun and compare these
to observed properties. We concentrate on Si IV 1394 A originating in the
transition region and examine the Doppler shifts of several other spectral
lines at different formation temperatures. Methods. We construct a radiation
MHD model extending from the upper convection zone to the lower corona using
the MURaM code. In this quiet Sun model the magnetic field is self-consistently
maintained by the action of a small-scale dynamo. We synthesize the profiles of
several optically thin emission lines, formed at temperatures from the
transition region into the corona. We investigate the spatial structure and
coverage of red- and blueshifts and how this changes with line-formation
temperature. Results. The model successfully reproduces the observed change of
average net Doppler shifts from red- to blueshifted from the transition region
into the corona. In particular, the model shows a clear imbalance of area
coverage of red- vs. blueshifts in the transition region of ca. 80% to 20%. We
determine that (at least) four processes generate the systematic Doppler shifts
in our model, including pressure enhancement in the transition region,
transition region brightenings unrelated to coronal emission, boundaries
between cold and hot plasma, and siphon-type flows. Conclusions. We show that
there is not a single process that is responsible for the observed net Doppler
shifts in the transition region and corona. Because current 3D MHD models do
not yet fully capture the evolution of spicules, one of the key ingredients of
the chromosphere, most probably these have still to be added to the list of

translation. First, FlexIT combines the input image and text into a single
target point in the CLIP multimodal embedding space. Via the latent space of an
auto-encoder, we iteratively transform the input image toward the target point,
ensuring coherence and quality with a variety of novel regularization terms. We
propose an evaluation protocol for semantic image translation, and thoroughly
evaluate our method on ImageNet. Code will be made publicly available.

However, limited work exists on the representativity of samples (datasets) for

We introduce three measurable concepts to help focus the notions and evaluate

representative sample mimicking the distribution of the target population is of
particular relevance when building AI systems. Through empirical demonstrations

the dominant microscopic HHG mechanisms. In liquids on the other hand, no
established theory yet exit and approaches developed for gases and solids are

powerful and reliable ab-initio cluster-based approach for describing the

The scheme is based on time-dependent density functional theory and utilizes
several approximations that make it feasible yet accurate in realistic systems.
We demonstrate our approach with HHG calculations in water, ammonia, and
methane liquids, and compare the characteristic response of polar and non-polar
liquids. We identify unique features in the HHG spectra of liquid methane that
could be utilized for ultrafast spectroscopy of its chemical and physical
properties: (i) a structural minima at 15-17eV, and (ii) a well-like shape in
the perturbative region that is reminiscent of a shape resonance. Our results
pave the way to accessible calculations of HHG in liquids and illustrate the

frames of video since we live in a dynamic world. In the computer vision area,
many researches focus on co-segmentation (CoS), co-saliency detection (CoSD)
and video salient object detection (VSOD) to discover the co-occurrent objects.
However, previous approaches design different networks on these similar tasks
separately, and they are difficult to apply to each other, which lowers the
upper bound of the transferability of deep learning frameworks. Besides, they
fail to take full advantage of the cues among inter- and intra-feature within a
group of images. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework to tackle
these issues, term as UFO (Unified Framework for Co-Object Segmentation).
Specifically, we first introduce a transformer block, which views the image
feature as a patch token and then captures their long-range dependencies
through the self-attention mechanism. This can help the network to excavate the
patch structured similarities among the relevant objects. Furthermore, we
propose an intra-MLP learning module to produce self-mask to enhance the
network to avoid partial activation. Extensive experiments on four CoS
benchmarks (PASCAL, iCoseg, Internet and MSRC), three CoSD benchmarks

apply a truncation in binding energy to the distribution function. This
approach has the disadvantages that one cannot choose the density to start
with, that the important dynamical quantities cannot be calculated
analytically, and that a fraction of the possible bound orbits are excluded a
priori. We explore another route and start from a truncation in radius rather
than a truncation in binding energy. We focus on the simplest truncated density
profile, the uniform density sphere. We explore the most common inversion
techniques to generate distribution functions for the uniform density sphere,
corresponding to a large range of possible anisotropy profiles. We find that
the uniform density sphere cannot be supported by the standard isotropic,
constant anisotropy or Osipkov-Merritt models, as all these models are
characterised by negative distribution functions. We generalise the Cuddeford
inversion method to models with a tangential anisotropy and present a
one-parameter family of dynamical models for the uniform density sphere. Each
member of this family is characterised by an anisotropy profile that smoothly
decreases from an arbitrary value $\beta_0\leqslant0$ at the centre to
completely tangential at the outer radius. All models have a positive
distribution function over the entire phase space, and a nonzero occupancy of
all possible bound orbits. This shows that one can generate nontrivial
self-consistent dynamical models based on preset density profile with a finite
extent.

(AEC) industry, information retrieval (IR) from unstructured textual data based
on natural language processing (NLP) is gaining increasing attention. Although
various deep learning (DL) models for IR tasks have been investigated in the
AEC domain, it is still unclear how domain corpora and domain-specific
pretrained DL models can improve performance in various IR tasks. To this end,
this work systematically explores the impacts of domain corpora and various
transfer learning techniques on the performance of DL models for IR tasks and
proposes a pretrained domain-specific language model for the AEC domain. First,
both in-domain and close-domain corpora are developed. Then, two types of
pretrained models, including traditional wording embedding models and
BERT-based models, are pretrained based on various domain corpora and transfer
learning strategies. Finally, several widely used DL models for IR tasks are
further trained and tested based on various configurations and pretrained
models. The result shows that domain corpora have opposite effects on
traditional word embedding models for text classification and named entity
recognition tasks but can further improve the performance of BERT-based models
in all tasks. Meanwhile, BERT-based models dramatically outperform traditional
methods in all IR tasks, with maximum improvements of 5.4% and 10.1% in the F1
score, respectively. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in two
ways: 1) demonstrating the advantages of domain corpora and pretrained DL
models and 2) opening the first domain-specific dataset and pretrained language
model for the AEC domain, to the best of our knowledge. Thus, this work sheds
light on the adoption and application of pretrained models in the AEC domain.

compression strategies in which distributed agents need to compress
high-dimensional observations of a source, then send the compressed bits via
bandwidth limited links to a fusion center for source reconstruction. Further,
we require the compression strategy to be progressive so that it can adapt to
the varying link bandwidths between the agents and the fusion center. Moreover,
to ensure scalability, we investigate strategies that depend only on the local
channel state information (CSI) at each agent. Toward this end, we use a
data-driven approach in which the progressive linear combination and uniform
quantization strategy at each agent are trained as a function of its local CSI.
To deal with the challenges of modeling the quantization operations (which
always produce zero gradients in the training of neural networks), we propose a
novel approach of exploiting the statistics of the batch training data to set
the dynamic ranges of the uniform quantizers. Numerically, we show that the
proposed distributed estimation strategy designed with only local CSI can
significantly reduce the signaling overhead and can achieve a lower
mean-squared error distortion for source reconstruction than state-of-the-art
designs that require global CSI at comparable overall communication cost.

such a theory of relativistic dissipative spin hydrodynamics features an
equation of motion for the rank-3 spin tensor, which follows from the
conservation of total angular momentum. Extending the conventional method of
moments for spin-0 particles, we expand the spin-dependent distribution
function near local equilibrium in terms of moments of the momentum and spin
variables. We work to next-to-leading order in the Planck constant $\hbar$. As
shown in previous work, at this order in $\hbar$ the Boltzmann equation for

domain the speech query belongs to, and a reranking module to rescore n-best
lists using domain-specific language models. In addition, an instance sampling
based method to training neural network language models (NNLMs) is proposed to
address the data imbalance problem in multi-domain ASR. In experiments, the
proposed framework was evaluated on navigation domain and music domain, since
navigating and playing music are two main features of Tencent Map. Compared to
a general ASR system, the proposed framework achieves a relative 13% $\sim$ 22%
character error rate reduction on several test sets collected from Tencent Map
and our in-car voice assistant.

prediction and detection of drivers of cleared homicides at the national- and
state-levels in the United States.
  Methods: First, nine algorithmic approaches are compared to assess the best
performance in predicting cleared homicides country-wise, using data from the
Murder Accountability Project. The most accurate algorithm among all (XGBoost)
is then used for predicting clearance outcomes state-wise. Second, SHAP, a
framework for Explainable Artificial Intelligence, is employed to capture the
most important features in explaining clearance patterns both at the national
and state levels.
  Results: At the national level, XGBoost demonstrates to achieve the best
performance overall. Substantial predictive variability is detected state-wise.
In terms of explainability, SHAP highlights the relevance of several features
in consistently predicting investigation outcomes. These include homicide
circumstances, weapons, victims' sex and race, as well as number of involved
offenders and victims.
  Conclusions: Explainable Machine Learning demonstrates to be a helpful
framework for predicting homicide clearance. SHAP outcomes suggest a more
organic integration of the two theoretical perspectives emerged in the
literature. Furthermore, jurisdictional heterogeneity highlights the importance
of developing ad hoc state-level strategies to improve police performance in
clearing homicides.

data and used to predict future values. It is assumed that the data
distribution does not change over time (stationarity). However, in real-world
scenarios, the data generation process changes over time and the model has to
adapt to the new incoming data. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and
leads to a decrease in the predictive model's performance. In this study, we
propose a new concept drift detection method based on autoregressive models
called ADDM. This method can be integrated into any machine learning algorithm
from deep neural networks to simple linear regression model. Our results show
that this new concept drift detection method outperforms the state-of-the-art
drift detection methods, both on synthetic data sets and real-world data sets.
Our approach is theoretically guaranteed as well as empirical and effective for
the detection of various concept drifts. In addition to the drift detector, we
proposed a new method of concept drift adaptation based on the severity of the

the limit function is also a demand function. Second, the space of demand

a single toroidal harmonic, good agreement is found when a large Lundquist
number is used in the JOREK simulation, such that resistive effects are
sub-dominant. Modelling EHOs where multiple toroidal harmonics are linearly
unstable, the saturated perturbation observed can differ in the dominant
toroidal harmonic. On the ideal timescale, a n=2 EHO is observed in JOREK,
while the saturated perturbation predicted by VMEC is a n=1 mode. Extending
simulations into timescales where resistive effects can play a role, similar
n=1 perturbations can be found. The coupling of different linearly unstable
toroidal harmonics in the JOREK simulation broadens the magnetic energy
spectrum and ergodises the plasma edge region, resulting in a more localised
pressure perturbation. These effects are not observed in VMEC, because closed
magnetic flux surfaces are enforced. Despite the sensitivity of JOREK results
on the assumed resistivity, saturated states can be found using both approaches
that are in reasonable agreement, even for this more advanced case.

video-surveillance systems. Current state-of-the-art models usually rely on a
""history"" of past tracked locations (e.g., 3 to 5 seconds) to predict a
plausible sequence of future locations (e.g., up to the next 5 seconds). We
feel that this common schema neglects critical traits of realistic
applications: as the collection of input trajectories involves machine
perception (i.e., detection and tracking), incorrect detection and
fragmentation errors may accumulate in crowded scenes, leading to tracking
drifts. On this account, the model would be fed with corrupted and noisy input
data, thus fatally affecting its prediction performance.
  In this regard, we focus on delivering accurate predictions when only few
input observations are used, thus potentially lowering the risks associated
with automatic perception. To this end, we conceive a novel distillation
strategy that allows a knowledge transfer from a teacher network to a student
one, the latter fed with fewer observations (just two ones). We show that a
properly defined teacher supervision allows a student network to perform
comparably to state-of-the-art approaches that demand more observations.
Besides, extensive experiments on common trajectory forecasting datasets
highlight that our student network better generalizes to unseen scenarios.

employ an energy method for the coupled Einstein-Euler field equations in

estimates if a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is included, which
suggests that the accelerated expansion of the physical universe that is

spacetimes. Here we derive an extended version of this formula that applies to
rotating compact objects. We start with the consideration of Kerr spacetimes
and derive a formula that is not restricted to a particular specific angular
momentum distribution of the inner accretion flow, such as Keplerian or
constant. Finally, we consider Hartle-Thorne spacetimes and include corrections
implied by the NS oblateness. For a particular choice of a single parameter,
our relation provides frequencies predicted by the CT model. For another value,
it provides frequencies predicted by the RP model. We conclude that the formula
is well applicable for rotating oblateness NSs and both models. We briefly
illustrate application of our simple formula on several NS sources and confirm
the expectation that the CT model is compatible with realistic values of the NS
mass and provides better fits of data than the RP model.

that explores and updates the policies at the parameter level. This class of
algorithms is widely applied in robotics with movement primitives or

relevant where exploration at the action level could cause actuator damage or
other safety issues. However, Black-box optimization does not scale well with
the increasing dimensionality of the policy, leading to high demand for
samples, which are expensive to obtain in real-world systems. In many practical
applications, policy parameters do not contribute equally to the return.
Identifying the most relevant parameters allows to narrow down the exploration
and speed up the learning. Furthermore, updating only the effective parameters
requires fewer samples, improving the scalability of the method. We present a
novel method to prioritize the exploration of effective parameters and cope
with full covariance matrix updates. Our algorithm learns faster than recent
approaches and requires fewer samples to achieve state-of-the-art results. To

disc midplane exhibit the non-linear three-wave resonant interactions between
streaming dust wave (SDW) and two inertial waves (IW). In the particular case
considered in this paper, SDW at the wavenumber $k^\bullet = 2\kappa / (g_z
t_s)$, where $\kappa$, $g_z$ and $t_s$ are, respectively, epicyclic frequency,
vertical gravitational acceleration and particle's stopping time, interacts
with two IW at the lower wavenumbers $k^\prime$ and $k^{\prime\prime}$ such
that $k^\prime < k_{\rm DSI} < k^{\prime\prime} < k^\bullet$, where $k_{\rm
DSI} = \kappa / (g_z t_s)$ is the wavenumber of the linear resonance between
SDW and IW associated with the previously discovered linear dust settling
instability. The problem is solved analytically in the limit of the small dust
fraction. As soon as the dynamical dust back reaction on gas is taken into
account, ${\bf k}^\bullet$, ${\bf k}^\prime$ and ${\bf k}^{\prime\prime}$
become slightly non-collinear and the emerging interaction of waves leads to
simultaneous explosive growth of their amplitudes. This growth is explained by
the conservative exchange with energy between the waves. The amplitudes of all
three waves grow because the negative energy SDW transfers its energy to the
positive energy IW. The product of the dimensionless amplitude of initially
dominant wave and the time of explosion can be less than Keplerian time in a
disc. It is shown that, generally, the three-wave resonance of an explosive
type exists in a wide range of wavenumbers $0 < k^\bullet \leq 2\kappa / (g_z
t_s)$. An explosive instability of gas-dust mixture may facilitate the dust
clumping and the subsequent formation of planetesimals in young protoplanetary

with previously reported values. At higher energies, the acoustic magnon mode
becomes subject to strong Landau damping and rapidly vanishes once it enters
the Stoner continuum. In addition to the acoustic magnon mode, we also observe

in real data is intricate, time-consuming and not scalable, while synthetic
data scales well but lacks realism. To avoid these problems, we present a
weakly-supervised reconstruction-based pipeline, named NeRF-Pose, which needs
only 2D object segmentation and known relative camera poses during training.
Following the first-reconstruct-then-regress idea, we first reconstruct the
objects from multiple views in the form of an implicit neural representation.
Then, we train a pose regression network to predict pixel-wise 2D-3D
correspondences between images and the reconstructed model. At inference, the
approach only needs a single image as input. A NeRF-enabled PnP+RANSAC
algorithm is used to estimate stable and accurate pose from the predicted
correspondences. Experiments on LineMod and LineMod-Occlusion show that the
proposed method has state-of-the-art accuracy in comparison to the best 6D pose
estimation methods in spite of being trained only with weak labels. Besides, we
extend the Homebrewed DB dataset with more real training images to support the

small-signal stability, evaluates the linkage between a state variable and a
mode. Applying the normal form theory, a nonlinear PF can be defined to
evaluate the participation of a state variable into modal dynamics following a
large disturbance, that gives considerations to resonances and nonlinearities
up to a desired order. However, existing nonlinear PFs are inconsistent with
the conventional linear PF when nonlinear dynamics following a large
disturbance attenuate and linear modal dynamics become dominating. This paper
proposes a time-variant nonlinear PF by introducing a time decaying factor and
the definition of a nonlinear mode. The new PFs consider modes of resonances
and their values naturally transition to a linear PF when the system state
becomes close to its equilibrium. The case study on a two-area four-generator
system shows that the new PF can correctly rank generators by their
participations in natural and resonance modes of nonlinear oscillation subject
to a large disturbance.

from galaxy clusters in cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps propagates into
the reconstructed CMB lensing field, and thus biases the intrinsic
cross-correlation between CMB lensing and large-scale structure (LSS). Through
stacking analysis, we show that residual tSZ contamination causes an increment
of lensing convergence in the central part of the clusters and a decrement of
lensing convergence in the cluster outskirts. We quantify the impact of
residual tSZ contamination on cross-correlations between the Planck 2018 CMB
lensing convergence maps and the SDSS-IV galaxy density data through
cross-power spectrum computation. In contrast with the Planck 2018
tSZ-deprojected SMICA lensing map, our analysis using the tSZ-contaminated
SMICA lensing map measures a $\sim2.5\%$ negative bias at multipoles
$\ell\lesssim 500$ and transits to a $\sim9\%$ positive bias at
$\ell\gtrsim1500$, which validates earlier theoretical predictions of the
overall shape of such tSZ-induced spurious cross-correlation. The tSZ-induced
lensing convergence field in Planck CMB data is detected with more than
$1\sigma$ significance at $\ell\lesssim 500$ and more than $14\sigma$
significance at $\ell\gtrsim1500$, yielding an overall $14.8\sigma$ detection.
We also show that masking galaxy clusters in CMB data is not sufficient to
eliminate the spurious lensing signal, still detecting a non-negligible bias
with $5.5\sigma$ significance on cross-correlations with galaxy density fields.
Our results emphasize how essential it is to deproject the tSZ effect from CMB
maps at the component separation stage and adopt tSZ-free CMB lensing maps for
cross-correlations with LSS data.

excluding active galactic nuclei (AGN). The Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosities of the
LAEs are $10^{42.4}-10^{43}\, \mathrm{erg}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We detect faint
emission in the median-stacked radial profiles at the level of $(3.6\pm
1.3)\times
10^{-20}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}$
from the surrounding Lyman-$\alpha$ halos out to $r\simeq 160$ kpc (physical).
The shape of the median-stacked radial profile is consistent at
$r<80\,\mathrm{kpc}$ with that of much fainter LAEs at $3<z<4$ observed with
the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), indicating that the
median-stacked Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles have similar shapes at redshifts $2<z<4$
and across a factor of $10$ in Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity. While we agree with
the results from the MUSE sample at $r<80\,\mathrm{kpc}$, we extend the profile
over a factor of two in radius. At $r>80\,\mathrm{kpc}$, our profile is flatter
than the MUSE model. The measured profile agrees at most radii with that of
galaxies in the Byrohl et al. (2021) cosmological radiative transfer simulation
at $z=3$. This suggests that the surface brightness of a Lyman-$\alpha$ halo at
$r\lesssim 100$ kpc is dominated by resonant scattering of Lyman-$\alpha$
photons from star-forming regions in the central galaxy, whereas at $r > 100$
kpc it is dominated by photons from galaxies in surrounding dark matter halos.

synthesizing (degrading) process via a deterministic model. However, some
degradations in real scenarios are stochastic and cannot be determined by the
content of the image. These deterministic models may fail to model the random
factors and content-independent parts of degradations, which will limit the
performance of the following SR models. In this paper, we propose a
probabilistic degradation model (PDM), which studies the degradation
$\mathbf{D}$ as a random variable, and learns its distribution by modeling the
mapping from a priori random variable $\mathbf{z}$ to $\mathbf{D}$. Compared
with previous deterministic degradation models, PDM could model more diverse
degradations and generate HR-LR pairs that may better cover the various
degradations of test images, and thus prevent the SR model from over-fitting to
specific ones. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our degradation
model can help the SR model achieve better performance on different datasets.

optimize the coding efficiency for each individual image. Specifically, apart
from the image content stream, we employ an additional model stream to generate
the transform parameters at the decoder side. The presence of a model stream
enables our model to learn more abstract neural-syntax, which helps cluster the
latent representations of images more compactly. Beyond the transform stage, we
also adopt neural-syntax based post-processing for the scenarios that require
higher quality reconstructions regardless of extra decoding overhead. Moreover,
the involvement of the model stream further makes it possible to optimize both
the representation and the decoder in an online way, i.e. RDO at the testing

in the traditional codecs, to improve the coding efficiency based on the

radio spectra of the MSP population. Using a sample of 179 MSPs detected in
eleven surveys carried out at radio frequencies in the range 0.135-6.6 GHz, we
carry out detailed modeling of MSP radio spectral behaviour in this range.
Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to explore a multi-dimensional
parameter space, and accurately accounting for observational selection effects,
we find strong evidence in favour of the MSP population having a two-component
power-law spectral model scaling with frequency, $\nu$. Specifically, we find
that MSP flux density spectra are approximately independent of frequency below
320 MHz, and proportional to $\nu^{-1.5}$ at higher frequencies. This
parameterization performs significantly better than single power-law models
which over predict the number of MSPs seen in low-frequency (100-200 MHz)
surveys. We compared our results with earlier work, and current understanding
of the normal pulsar population, and use our model to make predictions for MSP
yields in upcoming surveys. We demonstrate that the observed sample of MSPs

terms of digitalization, and software development and deployment, which later
pivoted towards the concept of Digital Twin during the collective reflection
sessions between the project participants. Through an iterative learning cycle
via discussions among the various project stakeholders, the case study led to
uncovering the roadblocks in practice faced by the Architecture, Engineering,

practitioners are facing difficulty in: (1) Creating a shared understanding due
to the lack of consensus on the Digital Twin concept, (2) Adapting and
investing in Digital Twin due to inability to exhaustively evaluate and select
the appropriate capabilities in a Digital Twin, and (3) Allocation of resources

computer vision and image processing communities. Recently, many methods have
been developed to detect human activities with varying degree of success. Yet,
the general human activity detection problem remains very challenging,
especially when the methods need to work 'in the wild' (e.g., without having
precise control over the imaging geometry). The thesis explores phase-based
solutions for (i) detecting faces, (ii) back of the heads, (iii) joint
detection of faces and back of the heads, and (iv) whether the head is looking
to the left or the right, using standard video cameras without any control on
the imaging geometry. The proposed phase-based approach is based on the
development of simple and robust methods that rely on the use of Amplitude
Modulation- Frequency Modulation (AM-FM) models. The approach is validated
using video frames extracted from the Advancing Out-of-school Learning in
Mathematics and Engineering (AOLME) project. The dataset consisted of 13,265
images from ten students looking at the camera, and 6,122 images from five
students looking away from the camera. For the students facing the camera, the
method was able to correctly classify 97.1% of them looking to the left and
95.9% of them looking to the right. For the students facing the back of the
camera, the method was able to correctly classify 87.6% of them looking to the
left and 93.3% of them looking to the right. The results indicate that AM-FM
based methods hold great promise for analyzing human activity videos.

(WAFA), weighted finite tree automata (WFTA), and polynomial automata (PA).
  First, we investigate the use of trees in the run semantics for weighted
alternating automata and prove that the behavior of a weighted alternating
automaton can be characterized as the composition of the behavior of a weighted
finite tree automaton and a specific tree homomorphism, if weights are taken
from a commutative semiring.
  Based on this, we give a Nivat-like characterization for weighted alternating
automata. Moreover, we show that the class of series recognized by weighted
alternating automata is closed under inverses of homomorphisms, but not under
homomorphisms. Additionally, we give a logical characterization of weighted
alternating automata, which uses weighted MSO logic for trees. Finally, we
investigate the strong connection between weighted alternating automata and
polynomial automata. We prove: A weighted language is recognized by a weighted
alternating automaton iff its reversal in recognized by a polynomial automaton.
Using the corresponding result for polynomial automata, we are able to prove
that the ZERONESS problem for weighted alternating automata with weights taken
from the rational numbers decidable.

primitive operators have surfaced several times over the years. An early issue
was raised by H. Hi{\. z} in the 1950s on the incompleteness of translated
calculi. Further pertinent work, some of it touched on here, was done in the
1970s by W. Frank and S. Shapiro, as well as by others in subsequent decades.
As we shall see, overlooking such possibilities has led to incorrect claims of
completeness being made (e.g. by J. L. Bell and A. B. Slomson as well as J. N.
Crossley) for axiomatizations of classical predicate logic obtained by
translation from axiomatizations suited to differently chosen logical
primitives. In this note we begin by discussing some problematic aspects of an
early article by W. Frank on the difficulties of obtaining completeness
theorems for translated calculi. Shapiro had established the incompleteness of
Crossley's axiomatization by exhibiting a propositional tautology that was not
provable. In contrast, to deal with Bell and Slomson's system which is complete
for propositional tautologies, we go on to show that taking a formal system for
classical predicate calculus with the primitive $ \exists$, setting $\forall x
\phi(x) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\neg \exists x \neg \phi(x)$, and writing down
a set of axioms and rules complete for the calculus with $\forall $ instead of
$ \exists$ as primitive, does not guarantee completeness of the resulting
system. In particular, instances of the valid schema $\exists x \phi (x)
\rightarrow \exists x \neg \neg\phi (x)$ are not provable, which is analogous
to what occurs in modal logic with $\Box$ and $\Diamond$.

  Optimization Problems",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulated annealing (SA) attracts more attention among classical heuristic
algorithms because the solution of the combinatorial optimization problem can
be naturally mapped to the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian. However, in
practical implementation, the annealing process cannot be arbitrarily slow and
hence, it may deviate from the expected stationary Boltzmann distribution and
become trapped in a local energy minimum. To overcome this problem, this paper
proposes a heuristic search algorithm by expanding search space from a Markov
chain to a recursive depth limited tree based on SA, where the parent and child
nodes represent the current and future spin states. At each iteration, the
algorithm will select the best near-optimal solution within the feasible search
space by exploring along the tree in the sense of `look ahead'. Furthermore,
motivated by coherent Ising machine (CIM), we relax the discrete representation
of spin states to continuous representation with a regularization term and
utilize the reduced dynamics of the oscillators to explore the surrounding
neighborhood of the selected tree nodes. We tested our algorithm on a
representative NP-hard problem (MAX-CUT) to illustrate the effectiveness of
this algorithm compared to semi-definite programming (SDP), SA, and simulated
CIM. Our results show that above the primal heuristics SA and CIM, our
high-level tree search strategy is able to provide solutions within fewer
epochs for Ising formulated NP-optimization problems.
