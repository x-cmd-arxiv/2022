model's complexity (e.g., number of fit parameters) affects its ability to make
accurate predictions. According to this trade-off, optimal performance is
achieved when a model is expressive enough to capture trends in the data, yet
not so complex that it overfits idiosyncratic features of the training data.
Recently, it has become clear that this classic understanding of the
bias-variance must be fundamentally revisited in light of the incredible
predictive performance of ""overparameterized models"" -- models that avoid
overfitting even when the number of fit parameters is large enough to perfectly
fit the training data. Here, we present results for one of the simplest
examples of an overparameterized model: regression with random linear features
(i.e. a two-layer neural network with a linear activation function). Using the
zero-temperature cavity method, we derive analytic expressions for the training
error, test error, bias, and variance. We show that the linear random features
model exhibits three phase transitions: two different transitions to an
interpolation regime where the training error is zero, along with an additional
transition between regimes with large bias and minimal bias. Using random
matrix theory, we show how each transition arises due to small nonzero
eigenvalues in the Hessian matrix. Finally, we compare and contrast the phase
diagram of the random linear features model to the random nonlinear features
model and ordinary regression, highlighting the new phase transitions that
result from the use of linear basis functions.

direct Coulomb interaction and realistic boundary conditions result in local

placing two inner contacts within the Hall bar geometry shows that the

we propose novel experiments which will enable us to distinguish the

~$36.5^\circ$ and line-of-nodes position angle ~$145^\circ$ east of north. In
contrast, fields at similar radii in the southern and western disk are
significantly perturbed from equilibrium, with non-zero radial and vertical
velocities, and distances significantly in front of the disk plane implied by
our north-eastern fields. We compare our observations to simple dynamical
models of the Magellanic/Milky Way system which describe the LMC as a
collection of tracer particles within a rigid potential, and the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) as a rigid Hernquist potential. A possible SMC crossing
of the LMC disk plane ~400 Myr ago, in combination with the LMC's infall to the
Milky Way potential, can qualitatively explain many of the perturbations in the
outer disk. Additionally, we find the claw-like and arm-like structures south
of the LMC have similar metallicities to the outer LMC disk ([Fe/H]~-1), and
are likely comprised of perturbed LMC disk material. The claw-like substructure
is particularly disturbed, with out-of-plane velocities >60 km s$^{-1}$ and
apparent counter-rotation relative to the LMC's disk motion. More detailed
N-body models are necessary to elucidate the origin of these southern features,

symbiotic star, THA 15-31, was previously described as a pre-main sequence star
belonging to the Lupus~3 association. Our observations, ancillary data, and
Gaia EDR3 parallax indicate that THA 15-31 is a symbiotic star composed of an
M6III red giant and an accreting companion, is subject to E(B-V)=0.38
reddening, and is located at a distance of ~12 kpc and at 1.8 kpc above the
Galactic plane in the outskirts of the Bulge. The luminosity of the accreting
companion is ~100 Lsun, placing THA 15-31 among the symbiotic stars accreting
at a high rate (2.5e-08 Msun/yr if the accretion is occurring on a white dwarf
of 1 Msun). The observed emission lines originate primarily from HI, HeI, and
FeII, with no HeII or other high-excitation lines observed; a sharp central
absorption superimposed on the Balmer emission lines is observed, while all
other lines have a simple Gaussian-like profile. The emission from the
companion dominates over the M6III red giant at $U$ and $B$-band wavelengths,
and is consistent with an origin primarily in an optically thick accretion
disk. No significant photometric variability is observed at optical or NIR
wavelengths, suggesting either a face-on orbital orientation and/or that the
red giant is far from Roche-lobe filling conditions. The profile of emission
lines supports a low orbital inclination if they form primarily in the
accretion disk. An excess emission is present in AllWISE W3 (12 micron) and W4
(22 micron) data, radiating a luminosity ~35 Lsun, consistent with thermal
emission from optically thin circumstellar dust.

geometric damping which is driven by the Hessian of the function to be

an appropriate tuning of the parameters, based on Lyapunov's analysis, we show
that the trajectories have at the same time several remarkable properties: they
provide fast convergence of values, fast convergence of gradients towards zero,

aligned. This article reviews the measurement techniques, key findings, and
theoretical interpretations related to the obliquities (spin-orbit angles) of
planet-hosting stars. The best measurements are for stars with short-period
giant planets, which have been found on prograde, polar, and retrograde orbits.
It seems likely that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and
secular perturbations are responsible for tilting the orbits of close-in giant
planets, just as those processes are implicated in exciting orbital
eccentricities. The observed dependence of the obliquity on orbital separation,
planet mass, and stellar structure suggests that in some cases, tidal
dissipation damps a star's obliquity within its main-sequence lifetime. The
situation is not as clear for stars with smaller or wider-orbiting planets.
Although the earliest measurements of such systems tended to find low
obliquities, some glaring exceptions are now known in which the star's rotation
is misaligned with respect to the coplanar orbits of multiple planets. In
addition, statistical analyses based on projected rotation velocities and
photometric variability have found a broad range of obliquities for F-type
stars hosting compact multiple-planet systems. The results suggest it is unsafe
to assume that stars and their protoplanetary disks are aligned. Primordial

gravitational wave (GW) detectors from binary neutron star (NS) mergers can
probe the high-density equation of state (EOS). We perform the first
simulations of binary NS mergers which adopt various parametrizations of the
quark-hadron crossover (QHC) EOS. These are constructed from combinations of a
hadronic EOS ($n_{b} < 2~n_0$) and a quark-matter EOS ($n_{b} >~5~n_0$), where
$n_{b}$ and $n_0$ are the baryon number density and the nuclear saturation
density, respectively. At the crossover densities ($2~ n_0 < n_{b} < 5~ n_0$)
the QHC EOSs continuously soften, while remaining stiffer than hadronic and
first-order phase transition EOSs, achieving the stiffness of strongly
correlated quark matter. This enhanced stiffness leads to significantly longer
lifetimes of the postmerger NS than that for a pure hadronic EOS. We find a
dual nature of these EOSs such that their maximum chirp GW frequencies
$f_{max}$ fall into the category of a soft EOS while the dominant peak
frequencies ($f_{peak}$) of the postmerger stage fall in between that of a soft
and stiff hadronic EOS. An observation of this kind of dual nature in the
characteristic GW frequencies will provide crucial evidence for the existence
of strongly interacting quark matter at the crossover densities for QCD.

presence of a clear-cut Mg-K anti-correlation makes Omega Centauri the third
stellar system, after NGC 2419 and NGC 2808, hosting a sub-population of stars
with [Mg/Fe]<0.0 dex, K-enriched in the case of Omega Centauri by ~0.3 dex with

correlation/anti-correlation between K and other light elements involved in
chemical anomalies supports the idea that the spread in [K/Fe] can be
associated to the same self-enrichment process typical of globular clusters. We
suggest that significant variations in K abundances perhaps can be found in the
most massive and/or metal-poor globular clusters as manifestation of an extreme
self-enrichment process. Theoretical models face problems to explain the K
production in globular clusters. Indeed, models where asymptotic giant branch
stars are responsible for the Mg-K anti-correlation only qualitatively agree
with the observations. Finally, we discovered a peculiar star with an
extraordinary K overabundance ([K/Fe]=+1.60 dex) with respect to the other
stars with similar [Mg/Fe]. We suggest that this K-rich star could be formed
from the pure ejecta of AGB stars before dilution with pristine material.

independently followed by a dot product, while the cross encoder jointly feeds
image and text as the input and performs dense multi-modal fusion. These two

together in the same model. Our work centers on empirical analyses of this
combined architecture, putting the main focus on the design of the distillation
objective. Our experimental results highlight the benefits of training the two

$T_c$ of two-dimensional superconductors and superfluids versus particle
density n or filling factor $\nu$, under the assumption that the transition
from the normal to the superconducting (superfluid) phase is governed by the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism of vortex-antivortex binding
and a direct relation between the superfluid density tensor and $T_c$ exists.
The standard critical temperature upper bound $T_c^{\rm up1}$ is obtained from
the Glover-Ferrell-Tinkham sum rule for the optical conductivity, which
constrains the superfluid density tensor components. However, we show that
$T_c^{\rm up1}$ is only useful in the limit of low particle/carrier density,
where it may be close to the critical temperature supremum $T_c^{\rm sup}$ .
For intermediate and high particle/carrier densities, $T_c^{\rm up1}$ is far
beyond $T_c^{\rm sup}$ for any given interaction strength. We demonstrate that
it is imperative to consider at least the full effects of phase fluctuations of
the order parameter for superconductivity (superfluidity) to establish tighter
bounds over a wide range of densities. Using the renormalization group, we
obtain the critical temperature supremum for phase fluctuations $T_c$ and show
that it is a much tighter upper bound to $T_c^{\rm sup}$ than $T_c^{\rm up1}$
for all particle/carrier densities. We conclude by indicating that if the $T_c$
is exceeded in experiments involving single band systems, then a non-BKT
mechanism must be invoked.

systematically developing stable and high-order accurate numerical methods for
time-dependent differential equations. The main idea behind existing SBP
operators is that the solution is assumed to be well approximated by
polynomials up to a certain degree, and the SBP operator should therefore be
exact for them. However, polynomials might not provide the best approximation
for some problems, and other approximation spaces may be more appropriate. In
this paper, a theory for SBP operators based on general function spaces is
developed. We demonstrate that most of the established results for
polynomial-based SBP operators carry over to this general class of SBP
operators. Our findings imply that the concept of SBP operators can be applied
to a significantly larger class of methods than currently known. We exemplify
the general theory by considering trigonometric, exponential, and radial basis
functions.

composition theorems allow one to query a private database quadratically more
times than basic privacy composition would permit. However, these results
require that the privacy parameters of all algorithms be fixed before
interacting with the data. To address this, Rogers et al. introduced fully
adaptive composition, wherein both algorithms and their privacy parameters can
be selected adaptively. The authors introduce two probabilistic objects to
measure privacy in adaptive composition: privacy filters, which provide
differential privacy guarantees for composed interactions, and privacy
odometers, time-uniform bounds on privacy loss. There are substantial gaps
between advanced composition and existing filters and odometers. First,
existing filters place stronger assumptions on the algorithms being composed.
Second, these odometers and filters suffer from large constants, making them
impractical. We construct filters that match the tightness of advanced
composition, including constants, despite allowing for adaptively chosen
privacy parameters. En route we also derive a privacy filter for approximate
zCDP and approximate RDP. We also construct several general families of
odometers. These odometers can match the tightness of advanced composition at
an arbitrary, preselected point in time, or at all points in time
simultaneously, up to a doubly-logarithmic factor. We obtain our results by
leveraging recent advances in time-uniform martingale concentration. In sum, we
show that fully adaptive privacy is obtainable at almost no loss, and
conjecture that our results are essentially unimprovable (even in constants) in
general.

fine-tuning large pre-trained models, where fine-tuned models often appear to
lie in a single low error basin. We show that averaging the weights of multiple

We propose instead an efficient method based on rank-$k$ updates -- or their

parameterize full $N$-dimensional unitary or orthogonal matrices with a
training runtime scaling as $O(kN^2)$. Our method either projects low-rank
gradients onto the closest unitary matrix (projUNN-T) or transports unitary
matrices in the direction of the low-rank gradient (projUNN-D). Even in the
fastest setting ($k=1$), projUNN is able to train a model's unitary parameters
to reach comparable performances against baseline implementations. In recurrent
neural network settings, projUNN closely matches or exceeds benchmarked results
from prior unitary neural networks. Finally, we preliminarily explore projUNN

that, under mild extra conditions, every locally constructible graph is a weak

In order to evaluate how well a surrogate model can account for the

comparison. Previous studies have compared models and brains in terms of their
representational geometries (characterized by the matrix of distances between
representations of the input patterns in a model layer or cortical area). In

sensitivity and specificity that they afford when used for model selection,

make inferences about the computational mechanism that might best account for a

to achieve a leap in performance and durability. Here we investigate a porous
electrode structure, as a strategy to increase the surface area, and provide
structural stability for Li-metal anodes. The porous architecture consists of a
mixed electron/ion conductor that function as a scaffold for lithium metal
deposition. A new finite element model was developed to simulate the large
topological changes associated with Li plating/stripping. This model is used to
predict the current density distribution as a function of material and
structural properties. A dimensionless quantity that combines Li-ion
conductivity, surface impedance and average pore size is shown to be a good
indicator to predict the peak current density. Preventing current localization
at the separator reduces the risk of cell shorting. The analyses show that the
peak current scales as $(hG)^{1/2}$, where $h$ is the ratio between surface and
bulk conductivity and $G$ is the average pore size. Stability analyses suggest
that the growth is morphologically stable, and that confining Li-plating into
pores can enable high-energy density solid-state batteries. In addition to
optimizing porous electrodes design, this finite element method can be extended
to studying other Li-battery structures.

more precisely than the current experimental result, reaching the precision of
the Standard Model (SM) prediction at 1 part in $10^4$. Considering several
inconsistencies between the SM predictions and data pointing towards the
potential violation of lepton flavor universality, the PIONEER experiment will
probe non-SM explanations of these anomalies through sensitivity to quantum
effects of new particles up to the PeV mass scale. The later phases of the

ratio of pion beta decay (BRPB), $\pi^+\to \pi^0 e^+ \nu (\gamma)$, currently
at $1.036(6)\times10^{-8}$, by a factor of three (Phase II) and an order of
magnitude (Phase III). Such precise measurements of BRPB will allow for tests
of CKM unitarity in light of the Cabibbo Angle Anomaly and the theoretically
cleanest extraction of $|V_{ud}|$ at the 0.02\% level, comparable to the

However, most NAS methods heavily rely on human-defined assumptions that
constrain the search: architecture's outer-skeletons, number of layers,
parameter heuristics and search spaces. Additionally, common search spaces
consist of repeatable modules (cells) instead of fully exploring the
architecture's search space by designing entire architectures (macro-search).
Imposing such constraints requires deep human expertise and restricts the
search to pre-defined settings. In this paper, we propose LCMNAS, a method that
pushes NAS to less constrained search spaces by performing macro-search without
relying on pre-defined heuristics or bounded search spaces. LCMNAS introduces
three components for the NAS pipeline: i) a method that leverages information
about well-known architectures to autonomously generate complex search spaces
based on Weighted Directed Graphs with hidden properties, ii) an evolutionary
search strategy that generates complete architectures from scratch, and iii) a
mixed-performance estimation approach that combines information about
architectures at initialization stage and lower fidelity estimates to infer
their trainability and capacity to model complex functions. We present
experiments in 13 different data sets showing that LCMNAS is capable of
generating both cell and macro-based architectures with minimal GPU computation
and state-of-the-art results. More, we conduct extensive studies on the
importance of different NAS components in both cell and macro-based settings.

$M(\lambda)\twoheadrightarrow V$ an arbitrary highest weight
$\mathfrak{g}$-module, we provide a cancellation-free, non-recursive formula
for the weights of $V$. This is novel even in finite type, and is obtained from
$\lambda$ and a collection $\mathcal{H}=\mathcal{H}_V$ of independent sets in
the Dynkin diagram of $\mathfrak{g}$ that are associated to $V$.
  Our proofs use and reveal a finite family (for each $\lambda$) of ""higher

universal modules for weight-considerations. They (i) generalize and subsume
parabolic Verma modules $M(\lambda,J)$, and (ii) have pairwise distinct

to synchronize signal propagations. Logic computations are aligned at and thus
isolated by flip-flop stages. Although this fully synchronous style can reduce
design efforts significantly, it may affect circuit performance negatively,
because sequential components can only introduce delays into signal
propagations but never accelerate them. In this paper, we propose a new timing
model, VirtualSync+, in which signals, specially those along critical paths,
are allowed to propagate through several sequential stages without flip-flops.
Timing constraints are still satisfied at the boundary of the optimized circuit
to maintain a consistent interface with existing designs. By removing
clock-to-q delays and setup time requirements of flip-flops on critical paths,
the performance of a circuit can be pushed even beyond the limit of traditional
sequential designs. In addition, we further enhance the optimization with
VirtualSync+ by fine-tuning with commercial design tools, e.g., Design Compiler
from Synopsys, to achieve more accurate result. Experimental results
demonstrate that circuit performance can be improved by up to 4% (average 1.5%)
compared with that after extreme retiming and sizing, while the increase of
area is still negligible. This timing performance is enhanced beyond the limit
of traditional sequential designs. It also demonstrates that compared with
those after retiming and sizing, the circuits with VirtualSync+ can achieve

entangled states in a quantum network through the use of a central node.
Specifically, we consider the scenario where the multipartite entangled state
is first prepared locally at a central node, and then transmitted to the end
nodes of the network through quantum teleportation. As our first result, we
present leading-order analytical expressions and lower bounds for both the rate
and fidelity at which a specific class of multipartite entangled states, namely
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, are distributed. Our analytical
expressions for the fidelity accurately account for time-dependent depolarizing
noise encountered by individual quantum bits while stored in quantum memory, as
verified using Monte Carlo simulations. As our second result, we compare the
performance to the case where the central node is an entanglement switch and
the GHZ state is created by the end nodes in a distributed fashion. Apart from
these two results, we outline how the teleportation-based scheme could be
physically implemented using trapped ions or nitrogen-vacancy centers in

spin accumulation induced in the bulk by an electric current is intrinsically
protected by the quasi-persistent spin helix arising from the crystal

accumulation, opening novel routes for the design of solid-state spintronics

the performance efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, such
accelerators are vulnerable to transient faults (i.e., soft errors), which
occur due to high-energy particle strikes, and manifest as bit flips at the
hardware layer. These errors can change the weight values and neuron operations
in the compute engine of SNN accelerators, thereby leading to incorrect outputs
and accuracy degradation. However, the impact of soft errors in the compute
engine and the respective mitigation techniques have not been thoroughly
studied yet for SNNs. A potential solution is employing redundant executions
(re-execution) for ensuring correct outputs, but it leads to huge latency and
energy overheads. Toward this, we propose SoftSNN, a novel methodology to
mitigate soft errors in the weight registers (synapses) and neurons of SNN
accelerators without re-execution, thereby maintaining the accuracy with low
latency and energy overheads. Our SoftSNN methodology employs the following key
steps: (1) analyzing the SNN characteristics under soft errors to identify
faulty weights and neuron operations, which are required for recognizing faulty
SNN behavior; (2) a Bound-and-Protect technique that leverages this analysis to
improve the SNN fault tolerance by bounding the weight values and protecting
the neurons from faulty operations; and (3) devising lightweight hardware
enhancements for the neural hardware accelerator to efficiently support the
proposed technique. The experimental results show that, for a 900-neuron
network with even a high fault rate, our SoftSNN maintains the accuracy
degradation below 3%, while reducing latency and energy by up to 3x and 2.3x
respectively, as compared to the re-execution technique.

Forgetting on old classes, resulting in poor generalization. To solve the

recognition tasks and sustain the catastrophic forgetting. First, we build an
Augmented Correlation Matrix (ACM) across all seen classes, where the
intra-task relationships derive from the hard label statistics while the
inter-task relationships leverage both hard and soft labels from data and a
constructed expert network. Then, based on the ACM, the proposed AGCN captures
label dependencies with dynamic augmented structure and yields effective class
representations. Last, to suppress the forgetting of label dependencies across
old tasks, we propose a relationship-preserving loss as a constraint to the
construction of label relationships. The proposed method is evaluated using two
multi-label image benchmarks and the experimental results show that the
proposed method is effective for LML image recognition and can build convincing
correlation across tasks even if the labels of previous tasks are missing. Our

G46.8-0.3 and its environment since its discovery more than 50 years ago. With
new flux measurements from radio surveys plus a compilation from the literature
we created an improved integrated radio spectrum of G46.8-0.3, which is well
fitted by a simple power-law with an index alpha = -0.535 +/- 0.012, then
excluding the presence of absorption by abundant ionised gas in the line of
sight, or in the SNR's proximity. The analysis of local changes in the radio
spectral index across G46.8-0.3 suggests a slight steepening at about 1 GHz,
which does not impact on the integrated spectrum of the source. From atomic
hydrogen (HI) spectra we placed the remnant at 8.7 +/- 1.0 kpc, and revisited
the distance to the nearby HII region G046.495-00.241 to 7.3 +/- 1.2 kpc. From
evolutionary models and our distance estimate, we conclude G46.8-0.3 is a
middle-aged ($\sim$1 x 10^4 yr) SNR. We recognised several 12CO and 13CO
molecular structures in the proximity of the remnant and used combined CO-HI
profiles to derive the kinematic distances to these features and characterise
their physical properties. We also provided compelling evidences for
environmental molecular clouds physically linked to G46.8-0.3 at its centre, on
its eastern edge, and towards the northern and southwestern rims on the far
side of the SNR shell. Our study does not confirm that the remnant is embedded
in a molecular cavity as previously suggested. G46.8-0.3 shows a line-of-sight
coincidence with the gamma-ray source 4FGL J1918.1+1215c, detected at GeV
energies by the space telescope Fermi. A rough analysis based on the properties
of the interstellar matter close G46.8-0.3 indicates that the GeV gamma-rays
photons detected in direction to the SNR can be plausibly attributed to
hadronic collisions and/or bremsstrahlung radiation.

large class of entangled states that become maximally useful for metrology in
the limit of large number of copies, even if the state is weakly entangled and
not even more useful than separable states. This way we activate metrologically
useful genuine multipartite entanglement. Remarkably, not only that the
maximally achievable metrological usefulness is attained exponentially fast in
the number of copies, but it can be achieved by the measurement of few simple
correlation observables. We also make general statements about the usefulness
of a single copy of pure entangled states. We surprisingly find that the
multiqubit states presented in Hyllus et al. [Phys. Rev. A 82, 012337 (2010)],

disks is an important process relevant to production of gravitaional waves from
binary Black Hole (BBH) merger events through the AGN channel. Since embedded
sBHs are surrounded by circum-stellar disks (CSDs), the rotation of CSD gas
flows determine the direction of the angular momentum it accretes. In this
Letter, we use global 2D hydrodynamic simulations to show that while a
disk-embedded sBH on a circular orbit transforms the initial retrograde
Keplerian shear of the background accretion disk into a prograde CSD flow, as
in the classical picture of companion-disk interaction theory, moderate orbital
eccentricity could disrupt the steady-state tidal perturbation and preserve a
retrograde CSD flow around the sBH. This switch of CSD orientation occurs at a
transition eccentricity that scales nearly proportional with local sound speed.
This bifurcation in the CSD flow and thereafter spin-up direction of SBHs leads
to formation of a population of nearly anti-aligned sBHs and should be
incorporated in future population models of sBH and BBH evolutions.

general class of two-mode nonlinear optical devices, we show that effective
optical nonlinearities can be created by subjecting the light field to a
repeated pulse sequence, which couples the two modes in a fast and

nonlinearities, which include an emerging four-wave mixing, can be varied by
simply adjusting the pulse sequence. This leads to topological changes in the
system's phase space, which can be detected through light intensity and phase

derives from a parent quantum many-body Hamiltonian describing driven

on tabular data problems. Unlike traditional models, e.g., MLP, these
architectures map scalar values of numerical features to high-dimensional
embeddings before mixing them in the main backbone. In this work, we argue that
embeddings for numerical features are an underexplored degree of freedom in
tabular DL, which allows constructing more powerful DL models and competing
with GBDT on some traditionally GBDT-friendly benchmarks. We start by
describing two conceptually different approaches to building embedding modules:
the first one is based on a piecewise linear encoding of scalar values, and the
second one utilizes periodic activations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that
these two approaches can lead to significant performance boosts compared to the
embeddings based on conventional blocks such as linear layers and ReLU
activations. Importantly, we also show that embedding numerical features is
beneficial for many backbones, not only for Transformers. Specifically, after
proper embeddings, simple MLP-like models can perform on par with the
attention-based architectures. Overall, we highlight embeddings for numerical

becomes essential to investigate ways to adapt these models to downstream
datasets. A recently proposed method named Context Optimization (CoOp)
introduces the concept of prompt learning -- a recent trend in NLP -- to the
vision domain for adapting pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically,
CoOp turns context words in a prompt into a set of learnable vectors and, with
only a few labeled images for learning, can achieve huge improvements over
intensively-tuned manual prompts. In our study we identify a critical problem
of CoOp: the learned context is not generalizable to wider unseen classes
within the same dataset, suggesting that CoOp overfits base classes observed
during training. To address the problem, we propose Conditional Context
Optimization (CoCoOp), which extends CoOp by further learning a lightweight
neural network to generate for each image an input-conditional token (vector).
Compared to CoOp's static prompts, our dynamic prompts adapt to each instance
and are thus less sensitive to class shift. Extensive experiments show that
CoCoOp generalizes much better than CoOp to unseen classes, even showing
promising transferability beyond a single dataset; and yields stronger domain
generalization performance as well. Code is available at

unusual strength of the high ionization lines. The SED and the $i - \text{W3}$

out"" gas and dust from their centers. The dominance of host galaxy light in its

measure its star formation history and investigate for variability for the
first time in an ERQ. Our analysis indicates that SDSS J004846.45-004611.9
underwent a short-lived starburst phase 400 Myr ago and was subsequently
quenched, possibly indicating a time-lag between star formation quenching and
the onset of AGN activity. We also find that the strong extinction can be
uniquely attributed to the AGN and does not persist in the host galaxy,
contradicting a scenario where the source has recently transitioned from being
a dusty sub-mm galaxy. In our relatively shallow photometric data, the source
does not appear to be variable at $0.24-2.4~\mu$m in the restframe, most likely
due to the dominant contribution of host galaxy starlight at these wavelengths.

drop in performance when a model is tested on a data distribution different
from the one that it is trained on. Adapting the source model to target data
distribution at test-time is an efficient solution for the data-shift problem.
Previous methods solve this by adapting the model to target distribution by
using techniques like entropy minimization or regularization. In these methods,
the models are still updated by back-propagation using an unsupervised loss on
complete test data distribution. In real-world clinical settings, it makes more
sense to adapt a model to a new test image on-the-fly and avoid model update
during inference due to privacy concerns and lack of computing resource at
deployment. To this end, we propose a new setting - On-the-Fly Adaptation which
is zero-shot and episodic (i.e., the model is adapted to a single image at a
time and also does not perform any back-propagation during test-time). To
achieve this, we propose a new framework called Adaptive UNet where each
convolutional block is equipped with an adaptive batch normalization layer to
adapt the features with respect to a domain code. The domain code is generated
using a pre-trained encoder trained on a large corpus of medical images. During
test-time, the model takes in just the new test image and generates a domain
code to adapt the features of source model according to the test data. We
validate the performance on both 2D and 3D data distribution shifts where we
get a better performance compared to previous test-time adaptation methods.

the aim of finding the optimal procedure. We focus on combining the pre- and
post-reconstructed derived quantities at different compression levels: 1) the
two-point summary statistics, the power spectrum multipoles, $P^{(\ell)}(k)$;
2) the compressed BAO variables, $\alpha_{\parallel,\perp}$; and 3) an hybrid

find that the three approaches result in very consistent posteriors when the
appropriate covariance matrix estimator is used. On average, the combination at
$P^{(\ell)}(k)$ level retrieves $5-10\%$ tighter constraints than the other two
approaches, demonstrating that the standard approach of combining at the level
of the BAO variables is nearly optimal. We conclude that combining both BAO
post-reconstructed and full shape pre-reconstructed signals for the one single
data realization at the level of the summary statistics is faster, as it does
not require running the whole pipeline on the individual mocks, and brings a
moderate $10\%$ improvement, with respect to the other two studied methods.
Moreover, we check for potential systematics, such as, the way the matrix is
built and the effect of the finite number of mocks on the likelihood estimator
and find none of these have a significant impact in the final results.
Combining the pre- and post-reconstruction signals at the level of the summary

produced through quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in a high-energy collider. We
argue that, in general, the total quantum state that can be probed in a
collider is given in terms of the production spin density matrix, which
necessarily gives rise to a mixed state. We compute the quantum state of a
$t\bar{t}$ pair produced from the most elementary QCD processes, finding the
presence of entanglement and CHSH violation in different regions of phase
space. We show that any realistic hadronic production of a $t\bar{t}$ pair is a
statistical mixture of these elementary QCD processes. We focus on the
experimentally relevant cases of proton-proton and proton-antiproton
collisions, performed at the LHC and the Tevatron, analyzing the dependence of
the quantum state with the energy of the collisions. We provide experimental
observables for entanglement and CHSH-violation signatures. At the LHC, these
signatures are given by the measurement of a single observable, which in the
case of entanglement represents the violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
We extend the validity of the quantum tomography protocol for the $t\bar{t}$
pair proposed in the literature to more general quantum states, and for any
production mechanism. Finally, we argue that a CHSH violation measured in a
collider is only a weak form of violation of Bell's theorem, necessarily
containing a number of loopholes.

had a wall-clock time that ranged from 1 to 21 days using a state-of-the-art
computing cluster with 100 cores. These computational costs have severe
environmental impacts and the long wall-clock time slows scientific
productivity. To address these difficulties, we introduce LINNA: the Likelihood
Inference Neural Network Accelerator. Relative to the baseline DES analyses,
LINNA reduces the computational cost associated with posterior inference by a
factor of 8--50. If applied to the first-year cosmological analysis of Rubin
Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST Y1), we conservatively
estimate that LINNA will save more than US $\$300,000$ on energy costs, while
simultaneously reducing $\rm{CO}_2$ emission by $2,400$ tons. To accomplish
these reductions, LINNA automatically builds training data sets, creates neural
network surrogate models, and produces a Markov chain that samples the
posterior. We explicitly verify that LINNA accurately reproduces the first-year
DES (DES Y1) cosmological constraints derived from a variety of different data
vectors with our default code settings, without needing to retune the algorithm
every time. Further, we find that LINNA is sufficient for enabling accurate and
efficient sampling for LSST Y10 multi-probe analyses. We make LINNA publicly

initially separated but unstable circular orbits around a supermassive BH
(SMBH). Such a close-packed orbital configuration can naturally arise from BH
migrations in the AGN disk. Dynamical instability of the orbits leads to
recurring close encounters between two BHs, during which the BH separation
$r_{\rm p}$ becomes less than the Hill radius $R_{\rm H}$. In the rare very
close encounters (with $r_{\rm p}$ several orders of magnitude less than
$R_{\rm H}$), a tight merging BH binary can form with the help of gravitational
wave emission. We use $N$-body simulations to study the time evolution of close
encounters of various degrees of ""closeness"" and the property of the resulting
binary BH mergers. For a typical ""SMBH + 2 BHs"" system, the averaged cumulative
number of close encounters (with $r_{\rm p} \lesssim R_{\rm H}$) scales
approximately as $\propto t^{0.5}$. The minimum encounter separation $r_{\rm
p}$ follows a linear cumulative distribution $P(<r_{\rm p}) \propto r_{\rm p}$
for $r_{\rm p} \ll R_{\rm H}$. From these, we obtain a semi-analytical
expression for the averaged rate of binary captures that lead to BH mergers.
Our results suggest that close-packed BHs in AGN disks may take a long time
($\gtrsim 10^7$ orbits around the SMBH) to experience a sufficiently close
encounter and form a bound binary, although this time can be shorter if the
initial BH orbits are highly aligned. The BH binary mergers produced in this
scenario always have high eccentricities when entering the LIGO band, and have
a broad distribution of orbital inclinations relative to the original AGN disk.
We also explore the effects of the gas disk and find that simple gas drags on
the BHs do not necessarily lead to an enhanced BH binary capture rate.

object grasping by starting from simulated datasets and have shown promising
performance in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, many of them still rely on
ad-hoc geometric heuristics to generate grasp candidates, which fail to
generalize to objects with significantly different shapes with respect to those
observed during training. Several approaches exploit complex multi-stage
learning strategies and local neighborhood feature extraction while ignoring
semantic global information. Furthermore, they are inefficient in terms of
number of training samples and time required for inference. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end learning solution to generate 6-DOF parallel-jaw grasps
starting from the 3D partial view of the object. Our Learning to Grasp (L2G)
method gathers information from the input point cloud through a new procedure
that combines a differentiable sampling strategy to identify the visible
contact points, with a feature encoder that leverages local and global cues.
Overall, L2G is guided by a multi-task objective that generates a diverse set
of grasps by optimizing contact point sampling, grasp regression, and grasp
classification. With a thorough experimental analysis, we show the
effectiveness of L2G as well as its robustness and generalization abilities.

We first describe the principle of nonlinear intensity filtering by using a
modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The latter alters the characteristics of
an input stochastic source based on Bose-Einstein emission. Computed output
intensity fluctuations are compared to an analytical model. Adjusting the
interferometer parameters, we show theoretically and numerically that the
statistical properties of light such as its probability density function can be
tailored. Depending on the parameters, the probability density may exhibit
large overshoots or smoother fluctuations. We further evaluate the impact of
these modified statistics on simple nonlinear processes. Compared to
Bose-Einstein emitters, the yield of nonlinear phenomena varies by several
orders of magnitude. We finally simulate the nonlinear interaction of such a
laser source with a dielectric material (fused silica) within the framework of
a more realistic model, including a statistical analysis. It confirms that the
deposited energy varies over many decades and can be largely enhanced due to
the properties of the presented laser source.

some studies are devoted to determine if a graph equipped with a convexity
space is a {\em convex geometry}. It is well known that chordal and Ptolemaic
graphs can be characterized as convex geometries with respect to the geodesic
and monophonic convexities, respectively. Weak polarizable graphs, interval
graphs, and proper interval graphs can also be characterized in this way. In
this paper we introduce the notion of {\em $l^k$-convexity}, a natural
restriction of the monophonic convexity. Let $G$ be a graph and $k\geq 2$ an
integer. A subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is \textit{$l^k$-convex} if and only if for
any pair of vertices $x,y$ of $S$, each induced path of length {\em at most}
$k$ connecting $x$ and $y$ is completely contained in the subgraph induced by
$S$. The {\em $l^k$-convexity} consists of all $l^k$-convex subsets of $G$. In
this work, we characterize {\em $l^k$-convex geometries} (graphs that are
convex geometries with respect to the $l^k$-convexity) for $k\in\{2,3\}$. We
show that a graph $G$ is an $l^2$-convex geometry if and only if $G$ is a
chordal $P_4$-free graph, and an $l^3$-convex geometry if and only if $G$ is a
chordal graph with diameter at most three such that its induced gems satisfy a
special ""solving"" property. As far as the authors know, the class of
$l^3$-convex geometries is the first example of a non-hereditary class of
convex geometries.

that partitions a molecule into fragments by minimizing the sum of fragment
energies subject to a local density constraint and a global electron-number
constraint. To perform this minimization, we study a two-stage procedure in
which the sum of fragment energies is lowered when electrons flow from
fragments of lower electronegativity to fragments of higher electronegativity.
The global minimum is reached when all electronegativities are equal. The
non-integral fragment populations are dealt with in two different ways: (1) An
ensemble approach (ENS) that involves averaging over calculations with
different numbers of electrons (always integers); and (2) A simpler approach
that involves fractionally occupying orbitals (FOO). We compare and contrast
these two approaches and examine their performance in some of the simplest
systems where one can transparently apply both, including simple models of
heteronuclear diatomic molecules and actual diatomic molecules with 2 and 4
electrons. We find that, although both ENS and FOO methods lead to the same
total energy and density, the ENS fragment densities are less distorted than
those of FOO when compared to their isolated counterparts, and they tend to
retain integer numbers of electrons. We establish the conditions under which
the ENS populations can become fractional and observe that, even in those
cases, the total charge transferred is always lower in ENS than in FOO.
Similarly, the FOO fragment dipole moments provide an upper bound to the ENS
dipoles. We explain why, and discuss implications.

social networks on annual migration choice; and (iii) embed these estimates in

connectedness. Across millions of individuals, we find that multiple measures
of social capital are concentrated among the rich and educated and among
migrants. Across destinations, both mobility patterns and social networks are
concentrated toward richer areas. A model of migration suggests individuals are
indifferent between a 10% increase in destination wages and a 12-16% increase
in destination social networks. Accounting for networks reduces the
migration-distance relationship by 19%. In equilibrium, equalizing social
networks across locations improves average wages by 3% (24% for the bottom
wage-quartile), a larger impact than removing the marginal cost of distance. We
find evidence of an economic support mechanism, with destination economic
improvements reducing the migration-network elasticity. We also find suggestive
evidence for an emotional support mechanism from qualitative surveys among
Facebook users. Difference-in-difference estimates suggest college attendance
delivers a 20% increase in network size and diversity. Taken together, our data
suggest that - by reducing effective moving costs - increasing social

forecasting processes are done by what is known as image interpolation, which

this work, we adopted the process of stitching the face by completing the
missing part with the flipping of the part shown in the picture, depending on
the fact that the human face is characterized by symmetry in most cases. To
create a complete model, two facial recognition methods were used to prove the
efficiency of the algorithm. The selected face recognition algorithms that are
applied here are Eigenfaces and geometrical methods. Image stitching is the
process during which distinctive photographic images are combined to make a
complete scene or a high-resolution image. Several images are integrated to
form a wide-angle panoramic image. The quality of the image stitching is
determined by calculating the similarity among the stitched image and original
images and by the presence of the seam lines through the stitched images. The
Eigenfaces approach utilizes PCA calculation to reduce the feature vector
dimensions. It provides an effective approach for discovering the
lower-dimensional space. In addition, to enable the proposed algorithm to
recognize the face, it also ensures a fast and effective way of classifying
faces. The phase of feature extraction is followed by the classifier phase.

has been encapsulated in the proposed system which is based on the machine
learning technique. For the recognition of the Arabic Sign Language, the
wearable sensor is utilized. This approach has been used a different system
that could suit all Arabic gestures. This could be used by the impaired people
of the local Arabic community. The research method has been used with
reasonable and moderate accuracy. A deep Convolutional network is initially
developed for feature extraction from the data gathered by the sensing devices.
These sensors can reliably recognize the Arabic sign language's 30 hand sign
letters. The hand movements in the dataset were captured using DG5-V hand
gloves with wearable sensors. For categorization purposes, the CNN technique is
used. The suggested system takes Arabic sign language hand gestures as input
and outputs vocalized speech as output. The results were recognized by 90% of
the people.

many astronomical observations without invoking the dark matter hypothesis.
Instead of falsifying the existence of dark matter, we propose MOND is an
effective theory naturally emerging from the long-range interaction and
collisionless nature of dark matter flow. It describes the dynamics of baryonic
mass suspended in fluctuating dark matter fluid. The long-range interaction
requires a broad size of halos to be formed that facilitate inverse mass and
energy cascade with a constant rate of cascade $\varepsilon _{u} \approx
-4.6\times 10^{-7}{m^{2}/s^{3}}$. In addition to the velocity fluctuation with
a typical scale $u$, the long-range interaction leads to fluctuation in
acceleration with a typical scale $a_{0}$. The velocity and acceleration
fluctuations satisfy $\varepsilon_{u}=-{a_{0}u/(3\pi)^{2}}$ due to energy
cascade, where factor $3\pi$ is from the angle of incidence. With $u_{0} \equiv
u(z=0)\approx 354.61{km/s}$, $a_{0}(z=0)\approx 1.2\times 10^{-10}{m/s^{2}}$
can be easily obtained. While Planck constant $\hbar$, gravitational constant
$G$, and $\varepsilon_{u}$ are proposed to find the dark matter particle
properties on the smallest scale, $u$, $G$, and $\varepsilon_{u}$ determine
halo properties on the largest scale. For given particle velocity $v_{p}$,
maximum entropy distributions of dark matter flow lead to kinetic energy
$\varepsilon_{k} \propto v_{p}$ for $a<a_{0}$ and $\varepsilon_{k} \propto
v_{p}^{2}$ for $a>a_{0}$. Combining this with constant $\varepsilon_{u}$,
Newtonian dynamics and ""deep-MOND"" behavior can be fully recovered. A notable
coincidence of cosmological constant $\Lambda \propto ({a_{0}/c})^{2}$ or a
linear relation for light speed $c=(3\pi)^3u_0$ might point to an entropic
origin of dark energy from acceleration fluctuation with its density
$\rho_{vac} \propto {a_{0}^{2}/G}$.

regularly arranged micro pillars has been investigated. The essential issues to
be addressed include the characteristics of a simple shear flow over
quadrilateral array of micro pillars, the effect of fluid inertia on the basic
flow pattern, and the decomposition of the complex surface friction. The
results show that the flow is characterized by a series of microscale
recirculating eddies in the gaps between the streamwise neighboring pillars.
The recirculation of the micro eddies and the oscillation of the overhead flow
climbing over the pillar tips create a local flow advection. At smaller
Reynolds number, the fluid inertia is weak and the flow patterns are
symmetrical about the pillar center. When the Reynolds number is sufficiently
large, the fluid inertia takes effect and breaks the symmetrical patterns. The
overhead flow tilts downward, forming a spiral long-range advection between the
fluid flow above pillar array and the flow in the spaces among micro pillars.
The local advection and long-range advection constitute the transport mechanism
in wall-normal direction. On micro-structured walls, the total friction
includes the reaction forces of micro pillars due to flow shear and flow
pressure at pillar surfaces and the reaction force of bottom plane due to flow
shear on bottom surface. For larger Reynolds numbers, fluid inertia prevents
the fluid from flowing along the curved surface of micro pillars and reduces
the equivalent shear stress of the pillar reaction force due to flow shear. At
the same time, the fluid inertia makes the overhead flow impact the windward
side of micro pillars more strongly and therefore increases the equivalent
shear stress of the pillar reaction force due to flow pressure.

$X$ such that $X\cdot X \cup (X +X)$ is covered by finitely many additive
translates of $X$. We prove that each approximate subring $X$ of a ring has a
locally compact model, i.e. a ring homomorphism $f \colon \langle X \rangle \to
S$ for some locally compact ring $S$ such that $f[X]$ is relatively compact in
$S$ and there is a neighborhood $U$ of $0$ in $S$ with $f^{-1}[U] \subseteq 4X
+ X \cdot 4X$ (where $4X:=X+X+X+X$). This $S$ is obtained as the quotient of
the ring $\langle X \rangle$ interpreted in a sufficiently saturated model by
its type-definable ring connected component.
  The above theorem can be seen as a general structural result about
approximate subrings: every approximate subring $X$ can be recovered up to
additive commensurability as the preimage by a locally compact model $f \colon
\langle X \rangle \to S$ of any relatively compact neighborhood of $0$ in $S$.
It also leads to more precise structural or even classification results. For
example, we deduce that every [definable] approximate subring $X$ of a ring of
positive characteristic is additively commensurable with a [definable] subring
contained in $4X + X \cdot 4X$. This implies that for any given $K,L \in

(i.e. $K$ additive translates of $X$ cover $X \cdot X \cup (X+X)$) of a ring of
positive characteristic $\leq L$ is additively $C(K,L)$-commensurable with a
subring contained in $4X + X \cdot 4X$. We also deduce a classification of
finite approximate subrings of rings without zero divisors: for every $K \in
\mathbb{N}$ there exists $N(K) \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every finite
$K$-approximate subring $X$ of a ring without zero divisors either $|X| <N(K)$

results suggest that quasi-Newton methods should be preferred for compressible

without the need for GPS. It is challenging to reliably match a ground image to
the correct satellite image since the images have significant viewpoint
differences. Existing works have demonstrated localization in constrained
scenarios over small areas but have not demonstrated wider-scale localization.
Our approach, called Wide-Area Geolocalization (WAG), combines a neural network
with a particle filter to achieve global position estimates for agents moving
in GPS-denied environments, scaling efficiently to city-scale regions. WAG
introduces a trinomial loss function for a Siamese network to robustly match
non-centered image pairs and thus enables the generation of a smaller satellite
image database by coarsely discretizing the search area. A modified particle
filter weighting scheme is also presented to improve localization accuracy and
convergence. Taken together, WAG's network training and particle filter
weighting approach achieves city-scale position estimation accuracies on the
order of 20 meters, a 98% reduction compared to a baseline training and
weighting approach. Applied to a smaller-scale testing area, WAG reduces the
final position estimation error by 64% compared to a state-of-the-art baseline
from the literature. WAG's search space discretization additionally
significantly reduces storage and processing requirements.

Normally, coupling of the molecular spin with the conduction electrons of

can protect the excited spin from decaying. In this work, we show that a
proximity-induced superconducting gold film can sustain spin excitations of a

studying inelastic spin excitations of the S=5/2 multiplet of FeTPP-Cl on Au

decreases with increasing film thickness, in apparent connection with the

most massive galaxy has a stellar mass of 10$^{9.35}$ M$_\odot$ and shows an
MgII P-Cygni line profile indicating the presence of an outflow, which is
consistent with the spatially resolved spectral analysis showing $\approx+$120

stellar disks. Previous studies have shown that substructures naturally develop
in the weakly ionized gas of magnetized, non-ideal MHD disks. The gas rings are
expected to trap large mm/cm-sized grains through pressure gradient-induced
radial dust-gas drift. Using 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations that include
ambipolar diffusion and dust grains of three representative sizes (1~mm,
3.3~mm, and 1~cm), we show that the grains indeed tend to drift radially
relative to the gas towards the centers of the gas rings, at speeds much higher
than in a smooth disk because of steeper pressure gradients. However, their
spatial distribution is primarily controlled by meridional gas motions, which
are typically much faster than the dust-gas drift. In particular, the grains
that have settled near the midplane are carried rapidly inwards by a fast
accretion stream to the inner edges of the gas rings, where they are lifted up
by the gas flows diverted away from the midplane by a strong poloidal magnetic
field. The flow pattern in our simulation provides an attractive explanation
for the meridional flows recently inferred in HD 163296 and other disks,
including both ""collapsing"" regions where the gas near the disk surface
converges towards the midplane and a disk wind. Our study highlights the
prevalence of the potentially observable meridional flows associated with the
gas substructure formation in non-ideal MHD disks and their crucial role in
generating rings and gaps in dust.

fashion remains an unsolved challenge in robotics. One way to address this
challenge is with unstructured human play, where humans operate freely in an
environment to reach unspecified goals. Play is a simple and cheap method for
collecting diverse user demonstrations with broad state and goal coverage over
an environment. Due to this diverse coverage, existing approaches for learning
from play are more robust to online policy deviations from the offline data
distribution. However, these methods often struggle to learn under scene
variation and on challenging manipulation primitives, due in part to improperly
associating complex behaviors to the scene changes they induce. Our insight is
that an object-centric view of play data can help link human behaviors and the
resulting changes in the environment, and thus improve multi-task policy
learning. In this work, we construct a latent space to model object affordances
-- properties of an object that define its uses -- in the environment, and then
learn a policy to achieve the desired affordances. By modeling and predicting
the desired affordance across variable horizon tasks, our method, Predicting
Latent Affordances Through Object-Centric Play (PLATO), outperforms existing
methods on complex manipulation tasks in both 2D and 3D object manipulation

suggesting an indirect coupling between them. The spectral evolution of the
minor flares can be explained by either an expanding synchrotron source or a

competency development. Yet, the effectiveness of student collaboration depends
on the extent that these interactions occur under conditions that favor
commitment, trust, and decision-making among those who interact. The sanitary
situation and the transition to emergency remote teaching have added new
challenges for collaboration, mainly because now, Information and Communication
Technologies mediate students' interactions. This study first explores the
effectiveness of different collaborative relationships on physics from a sample
of secondary students from two schools located in rural and urban areas in
southern Chile. We used Social Network Analysis to map students' academic
prestige, collaboration, and friendship ties. We define a strong association if
two students are declared mutually as friends. Using multiple linear regression
models, we found positive effects of collaboration on grades, particularly
among students working with friends (strong ties). Then, the second study
corresponds to a quasi-experiment on four classes at the analyzed urban school
during the following academic year. Here, students attended hybrid sessions to
test whether the effects of collaboration found on the first study were stable
throughout two semesters. Following the same procedures as in the exploratory
phase, we found that the initial effects of collaboration on grades are
negative for all collaborative variables, while strong working ties afford
academic gains later into the year. These results contribute to the literature
of collaboration in physics education and its effectiveness, taking into
account social relationships and the needed time for developing beneficial
collective processes among students in the classroom.

conjunction with transfer matrix methods, we tune the guided wavenumber
dispersion relation to exhibit stationary inflection points (SIPs), and also
non-stationary, or tilted inflection points (TIPs), within the dominant TE10

  The structure geometries are optimized to be able to achieve an SIP which

used to obtain and verify the existence of the SIP in the three-way coupled
waveguide and fine-tune the geometry such that a beam would be in synchronism
at or near the SIP. The three-way waveguide SWS exhibits a moderately high
Pierce impedance in the vicinity of a nearly-stationary inflection point,

introduced SWS geometries have directional coupler-like behavior, which enables
distributed power extraction at frequencies near the SIP frequency.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tangle is a distributed ledger technology that stores data as a directed
acyclic graph (DAG). Unlike blockchain, Tangle does not require dedicated
miners for its operation; this makes Tangle suitable for Internet of Things
(IoT) applications. Distributed ledgers have a built-in transaction rate
control mechanism to prevent congestion and spamming; this is typically
achieved by increasing or decreasing the proof of work (PoW) difficulty level
based on the number of users. Unfortunately, this simplistic mechanism gives an
unfair advantage to users with high computing power. This paper proposes a
principal-agent problem (PAP) framework from microeconomics to control the
transaction rate in Tangle. With users as agents and the transaction rate
controller as the principal, we design a truth-telling mechanism to assign PoW
difficulty levels to agents as a function of their computing power. The
solution of the PAP is achieved by compensating a higher PoW difficulty level
with a larger weight/reputation for the transaction. The mechanism has two
benefits, (1) the security of Tangle is increased as agents are incentivized to
perform difficult PoW, and (2) the rate of new transactions is moderated in
Tangle. The solution of PAP is obtained by solving a mixed-integer optimization
problem. We show that the optimal solution of the PAP increases with the
computing power of agents. The structural results reduce the search space of
the mixed-integer program and enable efficient computation of the optimal
mechanism. Finally, via numerical examples, we illustrate the transaction rate
control mechanism and study its impact on the dynamics of Tangle.

studied in the space of restrictions to the unknown manifold $Q$. Strong rates
of convergence are derived in terms of the fill distance of samples in the

functions, and the presence of towers of multihadron excited states with
relatively small mass gaps makes extraction of matrix elements of various
operators within the ground state nucleon challenging. Theoretically, the
allowed positive parity states with the smallest mass gaps are the $N(\bm
p)\pi(-\bm p)$, $N(\bm 0)\pi(\bm 0)\pi(\bm 0)$, $N(\bm p)\pi(\bm 0)$, $N(\bm

arises at one loop in chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT), however, in many
cases the contributions are enhanced. In this talk, I will review four such
cases: the correlation functions from which the axial form factors, electric
and magnetic form factors, the $\Theta$-term contribution to neutron electric
dipole moment (nEDM), and the pion-nucleon sigma term are extracted. Including
appropriate multihadron states in the analysis can lead to significantly
different results compared to standard analyses with the mass gaps taken from
fits to 2-point functions. The $\chi$PT case for $N \pi$ states is the most
clear in the axial/pseudoscalar form factors which need to satisfy the PCAC
relation between them. Our analyses, supported by $\chi$PT, suggests similarly
large effects in the calculations of the $\Theta$-term and the pion-nucleon
sigma term that have significant phenomenological implications.

this raises another challenge: most words are ambiguous, and judgments of words
in isolation fail to account for this multiplicity of meaning (e.g., ""wooden

new lexical resource of contextualized sensorimotor judgments for 112 English

that these ratings encode overlapping but distinct information from the

sources. One likely source of strong unwanted electric fields may be electrodes
recently proposed for the write-in of classical bits to molecular QCA input
circuits. Previous models have shown that the input circuits are sensitive to
the applied field, and a coupled QCA wire can successfully transfer the input
bit to downstream circuits despite strong applied fields. However, the ability
of other QCA circuits to tolerate an applied field has not yet been
demonstrated. Here we study the robustness of various QCA circuits by
calculating their ground state responses in the presence an applied field. To
do this, a circuit is built from several QCA molecules, each described as a
two-state system. A circuit Hamiltonian is formed and diagonalized. All
pairwise interactions between cells are considered, along with all
correlations. An examination of the ground state shows that these QCA circuits
may indeed tolerate strong unwanted electric fields. We also show that circuit
immunity to the dominant unwanted field component may be obtained by choosing
the orientation of constituent molecules. This suggests that relatively large
electrodes used for bit write-in to molecular QCA need not disrupt the
operation of nearby QCA circuits. The circuits may tolerate significant

significant increase from that of bulk TaSe$_{2}$ (T$_C$ = 0.14 K).
Superconductivity emerges from an increase of the density of states (DOS) as

methods, as they would use this biased model to obtain psuedo-labels (on the

attempting to select a balanced labeled dataset for SSL that would result in an

critical point whose properties still need to be fully understood. Recently, a
major breakthrough came about when the replica formalism was extended to build
a mean-field theory that provides an exact description of the jamming
transition of spherical particles in the infinite-dimensional limit. While such
theory explains the jamming critical behavior of both soft and hard spheres
(HS), investigating these two kinds of particles in finite dimensions poses
very different problems, particularly from the numerical point of view. Soft
particles are modeled by a continuous potential; thus, their jamming point can
be reached through efficient energy minimization algorithms. In contrast, such
methods are inapplicable in HS systems because the interaction energy among the
particles is always zero by construction. To overcome this difficulty, here we
recast HS jamming as a constrained optimization problem and introduce the
CALiPPSO algorithm, capable of readily producing jammed packings of HS without
including any effective potential. This algorithm brings a HS configuration of
arbitrary dimensions to its jamming point by solving a chain of linear
optimization problems. We show that there is a strict correspondence between
the force balance conditions of jammed packings and the properties of the
optimal solutions of CALiPPSO, whence we prove analytically that our packings
are always isostatic and in mechanical equilibrium. Furthermore, using
extensive numerical simulations, we show that our algorithm is able to probe
the complex structure of the free energy landscape, finding qualitative
agreement with mean-field predictions. We also characterize the algorithmic
complexity of CALiPPSO and provide an open-source implementation of it.

  photoexcitation",,,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The origin of the pseudogap in many strongly correlated materials has been a
longstanding puzzle. Here, we uncover which many-body interactions underlie the
pseudogap in quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) material (TaSe4)2I by weak
photo-excitation of the material to partially melt the ground state order and
thereby reveal the underlying states in the gap. We observe the appearance of
both dispersive and flat bands by using time- and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy. We assign the dispersive band to a single-particle bare band,
while the flat band to a collection of single-polaron sub-bands. Our results
provide direct experimental evidence that many-body interactions among small
Holstein polarons i.e., the formation of bipolarons, are primarily responsible
for the pseudogap in (TaSe4)2I. Recent theoretical studies of the Holstein
model support the presence of such a bipolaron-to-polaron crossover. We also
observe dramatically different relaxation times for the excited in-gap states
in (TaSe4)2I (~600 fs) compared with another quasi-1D material Rb0.3MoO3 (~60
fs), which provides a new method for distinguishing between pseudogaps induced
by polaronic or Luttinger-liquid many-body interactions.

the Lagrangian relaxation method. We theoretically analyze the structure of
optimal policies for the MDP problem and subsequently propose a structure-aware
algorithm that returns a practical near-optimal policy. Using the

allows us to extract empirical limb-darkening coefficients (LDCs) for the
widely used quadratic law, but also updated transit parameters (including
ephemerides refinements) as a byproduct. Comparing our empirically obtained
LDCs with theoretical predictions, we find significant offsets when using
tabulated \textit{TESS} LDCs. Specifically, the $u_2$ coefficients obtained
using \textsc{phoenix} models show the largest discrepancies depending on the
method used to derive them, with offsets that can reach up to $\Delta u_2
\approx 0.2$ on average. Most of those average offsets disappear, however, if
one uses the SPAM algorithm introduced by Howarth (2011) to calculate the LDCs
instead. Our results suggest, however, that for stars cooler than about 5000 K,
no methodology is good enough to explain the limb-darkening effect: we observe
a sharp deviation between measured and predicted LDCs on both quadratic LDCs of

results in a non-uniform sampled point cloud ill-suited to discretized
volumetric feature extraction. Current methods either rely on voxelized point
clouds or use inefficient farthest point sampling to mitigate detrimental
effects caused by density variation but largely ignore point density as a
feature and its predictable relationship with distance from the LiDAR sensor.
Our proposed solution, Point Density-Aware Voxel network (PDV), is an
end-to-end two stage LiDAR 3D object detection architecture that is designed to
account for these point density variations. PDV efficiently localizes voxel
features from the 3D sparse convolution backbone through voxel point centroids.
The spatially localized voxel features are then aggregated through a
density-aware RoI grid pooling module using kernel density estimation (KDE) and
self-attention with point density positional encoding. Finally, we exploit
LiDAR's point density to distance relationship to refine our final bounding box
confidences. PDV outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the Waymo Open

allowed by the observed orbit of S2 in the Galactic center, under the
simplified assumption of circular orbits and monochromatic mass function, we
assess the expected signal in gravitational waves, either from resolved and
non-resolved sources. We estimate a small but non negligible chance of $\simeq$
10% of detecting one single 1 M$_{\odot}$ primordial black hole with LISA in a
10-year-long data stream, while the background signal due to unresolved sources
would essentially elude any reasonable chance of detection. On the contrary,
$\mu$Ares, with a $\simeq$ 3 orders-of-magnitude better sensitivity at $\simeq$

typical PBH mass to be in the range 0.01-10 M$_{\odot}$ would increase LISA
chance of detection to $\simeq$ 40% towards the lower limit of the mass

the corresponding algorithms on a distributed computer is attractive, e.g.,
since distributed computers frequently are cost-effective and offer a high
accumulated memory bandwidth.
  Compared to the closely related particle methods, for which distributed
algorithms are well-established, the Galerkin discretization poses a challenge,
since the supports of the basis functions influence the block structure of the
matrix and therefore the flow of data in the corresponding algorithms. This
article introduces distributed $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices, a class of
hierarchical matrices that is closely related to fast multipole methods and
particularly well-suited for distributed computing. While earlier efforts
required the global tree structure of the $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrix to be stored
in every node of the distributed system, the new approach needs only local
multilevel information that can be obtained via a simple distributed algorithm,
allowing us to scale to significantly larger systems.

physics-informed Poisson statistical analyses of Kth-nearest neighbors (KNN) in
atom probe tomography, a new approach is demonstrated here for 3D nanoscale SRO

Sn, the SRO parameters of Sn-Sn 1NN in 10x10x10 nm$^{3}$ nanocubes can deviate
from that of the random alloys by $\pm$15%. The relatively large fluctuation of
the SRO parameters contributes to band-edge softening observed optically. Sn-Sn
1NN also tends to be more favored towards the surface, less favored under
strain relaxation or tensile strain, while almost independent of local Sn
composition. An algorithm based on least square fit of atomic positions further
verifies this Poisson-KNN statistical method. Compared to existing macroscopic
spectroscopy or electron microscopy techniques, this new APT statistical
analysis uniquely offers 3D SRO mapping at nanoscale resolution in a relatively
large volume with millions of atoms. It can also be extended to investigate SRO

study this question in a system composed of an attractive Hubbard layer in the
intermediate coupling regime, where the magnitude of the attractive Coulomb
interaction $|U|$ is slightly larger than the bandwidth $W$, hybridized with a
noninteracting metallic layer. We find that while the superconducting
transition becomes more mean-field-like with increasing interlayer hopping, the
superconducting transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ exhibits a nonmonotonic
dependence on the strength of the hybridization $t_{\perp}$. This behavior
arises from a reduction of the effective pairing interaction in the correlated
layer that out-competes the growth in the intrinsic pair-field susceptibility
induced by the coupling to the metallic layer. We find that the largest

The present study aims to (1) validate transient CFD simulations with
uncertainty quantification (UQ) for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation against
full-scale experiments in an operational atrium building, and (2) quantify the
sensitivity of the CFD results to the thermal boundary conditions. The UQ and
sensitivity analysis consider uncertainties in the initial and boundary
conditions for the temperatures. Considering the volume-averaged air
temperature on each floor, the predictions and measurements agree well with
discrepancies less than 0.3 {\deg}C. When considering the temperature averaged
over smaller zones on each floor, two trends can be observed. First, in zones
not adjacent to windows, the discrepancies between the CFD and measurements can
be explained by uncertainty in the boundary conditions and the measurements.
Second, in zones adjacent to windows, higher discrepancies are observed due to
oscillations in the inflow jets just downstream of the windows, and due to
geometrical simplifications in the CFD model. The sensitivity analysis
demonstrates that the boundary conditions for the thermal mass surface
temperature and the outdoor temperature have a dominant effect on the indoor
air temperature predictions, with their relative importance varying as function
of proximity to the windows.

generalized this problem by introducing the framework of customized efficient

leveraging unlabeled data with a small amount of labeled data. A prominent way
to utilize the unlabeled data is by consistency training which commonly uses a
teacher-student network, where a teacher guides a student segmentation. The
predictions of unlabeled data are not reliable, therefore, uncertainty-aware
methods have been proposed to gradually learn from meaningful and reliable
predictions. Uncertainty estimation, however, relies on multiple inferences
from model predictions that need to be computed for each training step, which
is computationally expensive. This work proposes a novel method to estimate the
pixel-level uncertainty by leveraging the labeling representation of
segmentation masks. On the one hand, a labeling representation is learnt to
represent the available segmentation masks. The learnt labeling representation
is used to map the prediction of the segmentation into a set of plausible
masks. Such a reconstructed segmentation mask aids in estimating the
pixel-level uncertainty guiding the segmentation network. The proposed method
estimates the uncertainty with a single inference from the labeling
representation, thereby reducing the total computation. We evaluate our method

bandwidth required to transmit the data downstream to the HSI processing unit.
This reduces the average energy consumption associated with pixel array of
cameras and the CNN processing unit by 25.06x and 3.90x respectively, compared
to existing hardware implementations. Our custom models yield average test
accuracies within 0.56% of the baseline models for the standard HSI benchmarks.

compound Bi$_5$FeTi$_3$O$_{15}$ (BFTO) at high hydrostatic pressure conditions.
The high-pressure XRD data does not explicitly show structural phase
transitions with hydrostatic pressure, however the observed changes in lattice
parameters indicate structural modifications at different pressure values. In
the initial pressure region values, the lattice parameters $\textit{a}$- and
$\textit{b}$- are nearly equal implying a quasi-tetragonal structure, however
as the pressure increases $\textit{a}$- and $\textit{b}$- diverges apart and
exhibits complete orthorhombic phase at pressure values of about $\geq$8 GPa.
Principal component analysis of high pressure Raman measurements point out an
evident change in the local structure at about 5.5 GPa indicating that the
evolution of the local structure under applied pressure seems to not follow
crystallographic changes (long range order). Nuclear forward scattering (NFS)
measurement reveal the development of magnetic ordering in BFTO at 5K with high
pressures. A progressive increase in magnetic order is observed with increase
in pressure at 5K. Further, NFS measurements carried out at constant pressure
(6.4GPa) and different temperatures indicate that the developed magnetism
disappears at higher temperatures (20K). It is attempted to explain these
observations in terms of the observed structural parameter variation with
pressure.

modern robotic systems due to the direct integration of range and geometry,
allowing for precise motion estimation and generation of high quality maps in
real-time. Yet, as a consequence of insufficient environmental constraints
present in the scene, this dependence on geometry can result in localization
failure, happening in self-symmetric surroundings such as tunnels. This work
addresses precisely this issue by proposing a neural network-based estimation
approach for detecting (non-)localizability during robot operation. Special
attention is given to the localizability of scan-to-scan registration, as it is
a crucial component in many LiDAR odometry estimation pipelines. In contrast to
previous, mostly traditional detection approaches, the proposed method enables
early detection of failure by estimating the localizability on raw sensor
measurements without evaluating the underlying registration optimization.
Moreover, previous approaches remain limited in their ability to generalize
across environments and sensor types, as heuristic-tuning of degeneracy
detection thresholds is required. The proposed approach avoids this problem by
learning from a collection of different environments, allowing the network to
function over various scenarios. Furthermore, the network is trained
exclusively on simulated data, avoiding arduous data collection in challenging
and degenerate, often hard-to-access, environments. The presented method is
tested during field experiments conducted across challenging environments and
on two different sensor types without any modifications. The observed detection
performance is on par with state-of-the-art methods after environment-specific
threshold tuning.

we first propose the Approximate Random Dropout that replaces the conventional
random dropout of neurons and synapses with a regular and online generated
row-based or tile-based dropout patterns to eliminate the unnecessary
computation and data access for the multilayer perceptron~(MLP) and long
short-term memory~(LSTM). We then develop a SGD-based Search Algorithm that
produces the distribution of row-based or tile-based dropout patterns to
compensate for the potential accuracy loss. Moreover, aiming at the convolution
neural network~(CNN) training acceleration, we first explore the importance and
sensitivity of input feature maps; and then propose the sensitivity-aware
dropout method to dynamically drop the input feature maps based on their
sensitivity so as to achieve greater forward and backward training acceleration
while reserving better NN accuracy. To facilitate DNN programming, we build a
DNN training computation framework that unifies the proposed techniques in the
software stack. As a result, the GPGPU only needs to support the basic operator

expressions for wave propagation, bi-directional reflectionless, and coherent
perfect absorption and lasing (CPAL) occuring in a finite periodic optical
waveguide network. Through the use of the generalized parametric space derived
from observation of PT-symmetric transfer matrix, Lorentz reciprocity theorem
and non-imaginary Bloch phase, we observe that when the unit cell is operated
at the PT broken phase or exceptional point, the system can always have
propagating modes, independent of the number and transmission phase of the unit
cell. On the other hand, when the unit cell is operated at the exact
PT-symmetric phase, the formation of propagating waves would depend on the
transmission phase of the unit cell. More interestingly, we find that even
though the unit cell is not operated at the exceptional point, reflectionless
with bi-directionality as well as unity transmittance can be achieved by
choosing appropriate number of unite cells and specific PT phases. We also find
two approaches to implement CPAL. One is to exploit odd number of the unit cell
operated at the CPAL point. Another way is to manipulate specific broken phase
with an appropriate number of the unit cells, while making transmission phase
to be null. We believe this work may offer a theoretical underpinnings for
studying extraordinary wave phenomena of PT-symmetric photonics and may open
avenues for manipulation of light.

typically increase the number of network parameters considerably. Such
complexity makes the inference stage highly inefficient for clinical
applications. Towards an effective yet economic segmentation network design, in
this work, we propose backward skip connections that bring decoded features
back to the encoder. Our design can be jointly adopted with forward skip
connections in any encoder-decoder architecture forming a recurrence structure
without introducing extra parameters. With the backward skip connections, we
propose a U-Net based network family, namely Bi-directional O-shape networks,
which set new benchmarks on multiple public medical imaging segmentation
datasets. On the other hand, with the most plain architecture (BiO-Net),
network computations inevitably increase along with the pre-set recurrence
time. We have thus studied the deficiency bottleneck of such recurrent design
and propose a novel two-phase Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm,
namely BiX-NAS, to search for the best multi-scale bi-directional skip
connections. The ineffective skip connections are then discarded to reduce
computational costs and speed up network inference. The finally searched
BiX-Net yields the least network complexity and outperforms other
state-of-the-art counterparts by large margins. We evaluate our methods on both

providing real-time vehicle motion from cost-effective camera images. However,
state-of-the-art optimization-based monocular VO methods suffer from the scale
inconsistency problem for long-term predictions. Deep learning has recently
been introduced to address this issue by leveraging stereo sequences or
ground-truth motions in the training dataset. However, it comes at an
additional cost for data collection, and such training data may not be
available in all datasets. In this work, we propose VRVO, a novel framework for
retrieving the absolute scale from virtual data that can be easily obtained
from modern simulation environments, whereas in the real domain no stereo or
ground-truth data are required in either the training or inference phases.
Specifically, we first train a scale-aware disparity network using both
monocular real images and stereo virtual data. The virtual-to-real domain gap
is bridged by using an adversarial training strategy to map images from both
domains into a shared feature space. The resulting scale-consistent disparities
are then integrated with a direct VO system by constructing a virtual stereo
objective that ensures the scale consistency over long trajectories.
Additionally, to address the suboptimality issue caused by the separate
optimization backend and the learning process, we further propose a mutual
reinforcement pipeline that allows bidirectional information flow between
learning and optimization, which boosts the robustness and accuracy of each
other. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the KITTI and
vKITTI2 datasets.

understanding the pathophysiology and behavioral changes of brain ischemia, and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool for measuring outcome in
preclinical studies. Brain extraction is an essential first step in most
neuroimaging pipelines; however, it can be challenging in the presence of
severe pathology and when dataset quality is highly variable. Convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) can improve accuracy and reduce operator time,
facilitating high throughput preclinical studies. As part of an ongoing
preclinical stroke imaging study, we developed a deep-learning mouse brain
extraction tool by using a U-net CNN. While previous studies have evaluated
U-net architectures, we sought to evaluate their practical performance across
data types. We ask how performance is affected with data across: six imaging
centers, two time points after experimental stroke, and across four MRI
contrasts. We trained, validated, and tested a typical U-net model on 240
multimodal MRI datasets including quantitative multi-echo T2 and apparent
diffusivity coefficient (ADC) maps, and performed qualitative evaluation with a
large preclinical stroke database (N=1,368). We describe the design and
development of this system, and report our findings linking data
characteristics to segmentation performance. We consistently found high
accuracy and ability of the U-net architecture to generalize performance in a
range of 95-97% accuracy, with only modest reductions in performance based on
lower fidelity imaging hardware and brain pathology. This work can help inform
the design of future preclinical rodent imaging studies and improve their
scalability and reliability.

stationary points for non-convex optimization problems by gradually reducing a
parameter value $t$, which changes the problem to be solved from an almost
convex one to the original target one. Existing GH-based methods repeatedly
call an iterative optimization solver to find a stationary point every time $t$
is updated, which incurs high computational costs. We propose a novel single
loop framework for GH methods (SLGH) that updates the parameter $t$ and the
optimization decision variables at the same. Computational complexity analysis
is performed on the SLGH algorithm under various situations: either a gradient
or gradient-free oracle of a GH function can be obtained for both deterministic
and stochastic settings. The convergence rate of SLGH with a tuned
hyperparameter becomes consistent with the convergence rate of gradient
descent, even though the problem to be solved is gradually changed due to $t$.
In numerical experiments, our SLGH algorithms show faster convergence than an
existing double loop GH method while outperforming gradient descent-based

K-Net for accurate MR image reconstruction from undersampled k-space data.
Methods: Most state-of-the-art reconstruction methods apply U-Net or cascaded
U-Nets in image domain and/or k-space domain. Nevertheless, these methods have
following problems: (1) Directly applying U-Net in k-space domain is not
optimal for extracting features in k-space domain; (2) Classical image-domain
oriented U-Net is heavy-weight and hence is inefficient to be cascaded many
times for yielding good reconstruction accuracy; (3) Classical image-domain
oriented U-Net does not fully make use information of encoder network for
extracting features in decoder network; and (4) Existing methods are
ineffective in simultaneously extracting and fusing features in image domain
and its dual k-space domain. To tackle these problems, we propose in this paper
(1) an image-domain encoder-decoder sub-network called V-Net which is more
light-weight for cascading and effective in fully utilizing features in the
encoder for decoding, (2) a k-space domain sub-network called K-Net which is
more suitable for extracting hierarchical features in k-space domain, and (3) a
dual-domain reconstruction network where V-Nets and K-Nets are parallelly and
effectively combined and cascaded. Results: Extensive experimental results on
the challenging fastMRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed KV-Net can
reconstruct high-quality images and outperform current state-of-the-art
approaches with fewer parameters. Conclusions: To reconstruct images
effectively and efficiently from incomplete k-space data, we have presented a
parallel dual-domain KV-Net to combine K-Nets and V-Nets. The KV-Net is more
lightweight than state-of-the-art methods but achieves better reconstruction
performance.

vary in different interstellar medium (ISM) conditions, but the details of this
mapping from galactic to cluster scales are poorly understood due to the large
dynamic range involved in galaxy and star cluster formation. We introduce a new
method for modeling cluster formation in galaxy simulations: mapping giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) formed self-consistently in a FIRE-2 MHD galaxy
simulation onto a cluster population according to a GMC-scale cluster formation
model calibrated to higher-resolution simulations, obtaining detailed
properties of the galaxy's star clusters in mass, metallicity, space, and time.
We find $\sim 10\%$ of all stars formed in the galaxy originate in
gravitationally-bound clusters overall, and this fraction increases in regions
with elevated $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, because such regions
host denser GMCs with higher star formation efficiency. These quantities vary
systematically over the history of the galaxy, driving variations in cluster
formation. The mass function of bound clusters varies -- no single
Schechter-like or power-law distribution applies at all times. In the most
extreme episodes, clusters as massive as $7\times 10^6 M_\odot$ form in
massive, dense clouds with high star formation efficiency. The initial
mass-radius relation of young star clusters is consistent with an
environmentally-dependent 3D density that increases with $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ and
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. The model does not reproduce the age and metallicity
statistics of old ($>11\rm Gyr$) globular clusters found in the Milky Way,
possibly because it forms stars more slowly at $z>3$.

designed to adaptively adjust the gradient from margin loss, the other boosts
the selectivity of margin sampling by taking the gradient direction into

this study, we pioneeringly confirm that properly incorporating activation

equivalent entities in different graphs, which can effectively enrich knowledge
representations of KGs. However, in practice, different KGs often include
dangling entities whose counterparts cannot be found in the other graph, which
limits the performance of EA methods. To improve EA with dangling entities, we
propose an unsupervised method called Semi-constraint Optimal Transport for
Entity Alignment in Dangling cases (SoTead). Our main idea is to model the
entity alignment between two KGs as an optimal transport problem from one KG's
entities to the others. First, we set pseudo entity pairs between KGs based on
pretrained word embeddings. Then, we conduct contrastive metric learning to
obtain the transport cost between each entity pair. Finally, we introduce a
virtual entity for each KG to ""align"" the dangling entities from the other KGs,
which relaxes the optimization constraints and leads to a semi-constraint
optimal transport. In the experimental part, we first show the superiority of
SoTead on a commonly-used entity alignment dataset. Besides, to analyze the
ability for dangling entity detection with other baselines, we construct a
medical cross-lingual knowledge graph dataset, MedED, where our SoTead also
reaches state-of-the-art performance.

uncharted terahertz (THz) electronics and device architectures. Here, we
succeeded in resolving O-E conversion processes in high-quality graphene by
on-chip electrical readout of ultrafast photothermoelectric current. By
suppressing the RC time constant using a resistive zinc oxide top gate, we
constructed a gate-tunable graphene photodetector with a bandwidth of up to 220
GHz. By measuring nonlocal photocurrent dynamics, we found that the
photocurrent extraction from the electrode is instantaneous without a
measurable carrier transit time across several-micrometer-long graphene,
following the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The time for photocurrent generation is
exceptionally tunable from immediate to > 4 ps, and its origin is identified as
Fermi-level-dependent intraband carrier-carrier scattering. Our results bridge
the gap between ultrafast optical science and device engineering, accelerating
ultrafast graphene optoelectronic applications.

matrices is a critical drawback of MRI, making patients uncomfortable and
wasting important time for diagnosing emergent diseases. This paper aims to
reducing the scan time by actively and sequentially selecting partial phases in
a short time so that a slice can be accurately reconstructed from the resultant
slice-specific incomplete K-space matrix. Methods: A transformer based deep
reinforcement learning framework is proposed for actively determining a
sequence of partial phases according to reconstruction-quality based Q-value (a
function of reward), where the reward is the improvement degree of
reconstructed image quality. The Q-value is efficiently predicted from binary
phase-indicator vectors, incomplete K-space matrices and their corresponding
undersampled images with a light-weight transformer so that the sequential
information of phases and global relationship in images can be used. The
inverse Fourier transform is employed for efficiently computing the
undersampled images and hence gaining the rewards of selecting phases. Results:
Experimental results on the fastMRI dataset with original K-space data
accessible demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy superiorities of proposed
method. Compared with the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based method
proposed by Pineda et al., the proposed method is roughly 150 times faster and
achieves significant improvement in reconstruction accuracy. Conclusions: We
have proposed a light-weight transformer based deep reinforcement learning
framework for generating high-quality slice-specific trajectory consisting of a
small number of phases. The proposed method, called TITLE (Transformer Involved
Trajectory LEarning), has remarkable superiority in phase-encode selection
efficiency and image reconstruction accuracy.

the laser intensity dependence of HHGs, which consists of a linear growth
regime, followed by a plateau of the saturated HHGs, and then a transition to a
nonlinear growth. The knee structure is rather universal for the varied
harmonic orders and has been certificated by the calculations of two-band
density-matrix equations as well as the \textit{ab initio} calculations of

reveal the underlying mechanisms: The behavior of linear growth can be depicted
analytically by the perturbative theory of optical conductivity; While, the
plateau of saturated HHGs and the transition to a nonlinear growth are caused
by the quantum destructive interference and constructive interference of
harmonics generated by the electrons corresponding to the lattice momentums
around Dirac points and M points in Brillouin zone, respectively. In

collective dynamics among interacting species in ecosystems. Conventional
research on species persistence in spatial populations has focused on static
network structure, though most real network structures change in time, forming
time-varying networks. This raises the question, in metacommunities, how does
the pattern of synchrony vary with temporal evolution in the network structure.
The synchronous dynamics among species are known to reduce metacommunity
persistence. Here, we consider a time-varying metacommunity small-world network
consisting of a chaotic three-species food chain oscillator in each patch/node.
The rate of change in the network connectivity is determined by the natural
frequency or its subharmonics of the constituent oscillator to allow sufficient
time for the evolution of species in between successive rewirings. We find that
over a range of coupling strengths and rewiring periods, even higher rewiring
probabilities drive a network from asynchrony towards synchrony. Moreover, in
networks with a small rewiring period, an increase in average degree (more
connected networks) pushes the asynchronous dynamics to synchrony. On the
contrary, in networks with a low average degree, a higher rewiring period
drives the synchronous dynamics to asynchrony resulting in increased species
persistence. Our results also follow the calculation of synchronization time
and robust across other ecosystem models. Overall, our study opens the
possibility of developing temporal connectivity strategies to increase species
persistence in ecological networks.

muon-spin relaxation/rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements performed on CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
across a broad temperature range, in order to uncover the nature of the
charge-density wave order and superconductivity in this material. From
zero-field $\mu$SR, we find that spontaneous magnetic fields appear below 50 K
which is well below the charge-density wave transition ($T^* \sim 93$ K). We
show that these spontaneous fields are dynamic in nature making it difficult to
associate them with a hidden static order. The superconducting state of
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is found to preserve time-reversal symmetry and the
transverse-field $\mu$SR results are consistent with a superconducting state
that has two fully open gaps.

for diffusion equations with random and fast oscillatory coefficients. In the
proposed method, the homogenized solutions are sought through a two-stage
procedure. In the first stage, the original oscillatory diffusion equation is
approximated, for each fixed random sample w, by a spatially homogenized
diffusion equation with piecewise constant coefficients, resulting a random
diffusion equation. In the second stage, the resulted random diffusion equation
is approximated and computed by using an efficient multi-modes Monte Carlo
method which only requires to solve a diffusion equation with a constant
diffusion coefficient and a random right-hand side. The main advantage of the
proposed method is that it separates the computational difficulty caused by the
spatial fast oscillation of the solution and that caused by the randomness of
the solution, so they can be overcome separately using different strategies.
The convergence of the solution of the spatially homogenized equation (from the
first stage) to the solution of the original random diffusion equation is
established and the optimal rate of convergence is also obtained for the
proposed multi-modes Monte Carlo method. Numerical experiments on some
benchmark test problems for random composite materials are also presented to
gauge the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed two-stage stochastic

long-term goals. We're interested in developing interventions that steer
individuals toward making good initial decisions and then maintaining those
decisions over time. In the realm of financial decision making, a particularly
successful approach is the prize-linked savings account: individuals are
incentivized to make deposits by tying deposits to a periodic lottery that
awards bonuses to the savers. Although these lotteries have been very effective
in motivating savers across the globe, they are a one-size-fits-all solution.
We investigate whether customized bonuses can be more effective. We formalize a
delayed-gratification task as a Markov decision problem and characterize
individuals as rational agents subject to temporal discounting, a cost
associated with effort, and fluctuations in willpower. Our theory is able to
explain key behavioral findings in intertemporal choice. We created an online
delayed-gratification game in which the player scores points by selecting a
queue to wait in and then performing a series of actions to advance to the
front. Data collected from the game is fit to the model, and the instantiated
model is then used to optimize predicted player performance over a space of

this paper, we aim to mine comprehensive co-salient features with democracy and
reduce background interference without introducing any extra information. To
achieve this, we design a democratic prototype generation module to generate
democratic response maps, covering sufficient co-salient regions and thereby
involving more shared attributes of co-salient objects. Then a comprehensive
prototype based on the response maps can be generated as a guide for final
prediction. To suppress the noisy background information in the prototype, we
propose a self-contrastive learning module, where both positive and negative
pairs are formed without relying on additional classification information.
Besides, we also design a democratic feature enhancement module to further
strengthen the co-salient features by readjusting attention values. Extensive

distribution of 3D human pose, but also a probabilistic mapping from
observations to the latent space from which we can generate a plausible pose
along with uncertainty estimates for the joints. We show that our approach is
not only a strong predictive model, but can also act as an efficient pose prior
in different optimization settings where a good initial latent code plays a
major role.

mechanical motion and guided optical modes. State-of-the-art demonstrations
rely on optical and mechanical modes tightly confined of in micron-scale areas
to achieve strong optomechanical coupling. However, the need for tight
optomechanical confinement and the general use of suspended devices hinders
interaction with external devices, limiting the potential for the
implementation of complex circuits. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new
approach for optomechanical cavities coupling free-propagating surface acoustic
waves (SAWs) and guided optical modes. The cavity is formed by a periodic array
of silicon nanopillars with subwavelength separation, implemented in
silicon-on-insulator substrate. Optical pumping yields a strong radiation
pressure that drives the harmonic vibration of the pillars, periodically
deforming the silica under-cladding and exciting the SAW. The propagation of
the SAW deforms the cavity period, modulating the resonance wavelength to close
the optomechanical coupling loop. Based on this concept, we experimentally
demonstrate a phonon laser at room temperature and ambient conditions with
optical pump power as low as 1 mW. We also show the possibility to cascade this
process, achieving a frequency comb generation with more than 30 harmonic
lines. These results open a new path to achieve strong bidirectional coupling
between integrated waveguides and SAW, with a great potential for a wide range
of applications in quantum and classical domains.

cases of a drop advection and a drop in a shear flow, showing significant
improvement in the accuracy over the commonly used conservative phase-field
method.
  Moreover, the proposed model imposes a lesser restrictive
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, and hence, is less expensive compared to
other conservative phase-field models. We also propose improvements on
computation of surface tension forces and show that the proposed improvement
significantly reduces the magnitude of spurious velocities at the interface.

conservation of kinetic energy, which is a sufficient condition for the
numerical stability of incompressible flows, in the absence of dissipative

extend the above condensation quantum phase transitions to finite temperature

approximators can help mitigate the sample complexity burden in modern
reinforcement learning problems, existing endeavors usually enforce powerful
function representation models (e.g. neural networks) to learn the optimal
policies. However, a precise understanding of the statistical limits with
function representations, remains elusive, even when such a representation is
linear.
  Towards this goal, we study the statistical limits of offline reinforcement
learning with linear model representations. To derive the tight offline
learning bound, we design the variance-aware pessimistic value iteration
(VAPVI), which adopts the conditional variance information of the value
function for time-inhomogeneous episodic linear Markov decision processes
(MDPs). VAPVI leverages estimated variances of the value functions to reweight
the Bellman residuals in the least-square pessimistic value iteration and
provides improved offline learning bounds over the best-known existing results
(whereas the Bellman residuals are equally weighted by design). More
importantly, our learning bounds are expressed in terms of system quantities,
which provide natural instance-dependent characterizations that previous
results are short of. We hope our results draw a clearer picture of what
offline learning should look like when linear representations are provided.

introducing sparsity in the weights. Because taking advantage of sparse
matrices is still challenging, pruning is often performed in a structured way,
i.e. removing entire convolution filters in the case of ConvNets, according to
a chosen pruning criteria. Common pruning criteria, such as l1-norm or
movement, usually do not consider the individual utility of filters, which may
lead to: (1) the removal of filters exhibiting rare, thus important and
discriminative behaviour, and (2) the retaining of filters with redundant
information. In this paper, we present a technique solving those two issues,
and which can be appended to any pruning criteria. This technique ensures that
the criteria of selection focuses on redundant filters, while retaining the

of maintaining the FairGAN's main targets of data utility, classification
utility, and data fairness, while widening its applicability and ease of use.
In this paper we present the technical extensions required to adapt the
original architecture to this new framework (and in particular the use of
Variational Auto-Encoders), and discuss the benefits, trade-offs, and
limitations of the new model.

groups. By the Riemann-Hurwitz bound, there are just finitely many groups that
act on an orientable surface $\mathcal{S}_g$ of genus $g\geq 2$. With each such
action of a group $\mathrm{G}$ on $\mathcal{S}_g$ one can associate the
fundamental group $\Gamma=\pi(\mathcal{O})$ of the quotient orbifold
$\mathcal{O}=\mathcal{S}_g/\mathrm{G}$, isomorphic to a Fuchsian group. Riemann
existence theorem reduces the problem of the existence of an action of
$\mathrm{G}$ on $\mathcal{S}_g$ to a purely group-theoretical problem of
deciding whether there is an order-preserving epimorphism mapping the Fuchsian
group $\Gamma$ onto the group $\mathrm{G}$. Using computer algebra systems such
as Magma or GAP, together with the library of small groups, the generation of
all discrete groups for a fixed small genus $g\geq 2$ becomes almost a routine
procedure. The difficult part is to determine the classes of these actions with
respect to topological equivalence. To achieve this, one needs to investigate
the action of the automorphism group of a Fuchsian group on the set of discrete
groups of genus $g$ with the corresponding signature. There is a close
relationship between the problem of determining equivalence classes of discrete
groups and the investigation of generating sets of the mapping class groups of
the orbifold $\mathcal{O}$. While the two particular cases when $\Gamma$ has a
planar signature or when $\Gamma$ is a surface group have already been studied
in detail, in general, the problem of determining an appropriate generating set
of a mapping class group of $\mathcal{O}$ is not solved. In this paper we
derive several results on the topological equivalence of discrete groups. As an
application, we derive complete lists of discrete groups of genus $5$ and $6$
distinguished up to the topological equivalence.

populations (measures) that evolve with time. These complex datasets,
describing dynamics with both time and spatial components, pose new challenges
for data analysis. We propose in this work a new framework to carry out
averaging of these datasets, with the goal of synthesizing a representative
template trajectory from multiple trajectories. We show that this requires
addressing three sources of invariance: shifts in time, space, and total
population size (or mass/amplitude). Here we draw inspiration from dynamic time
warping (DTW), optimal transport (OT) theory and its unbalanced extension (UOT)
to propose a criterion that can address all three issues. This proposal
leverages a smooth formulation of DTW (Soft-DTW) that is shown to capture
temporal shifts, and UOT to handle both variations in space and size. Our
proposed loss can be used to define spatio-temporal barycenters as Fr\'echet
means. Using Fenchel duality, we show how these barycenters can be computed
efficiently, in parallel, via a novel variant of entropy-regularized debiased
UOT. Experiments on handwritten letters and brain imaging data confirm our
theoretical findings and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed loss for
spatio-temporal data.

  For the first time, resonance structure is observed in the cross section line

  A fit to data with two coherent Breit-Wigner resonances modeling the

  This article illustrates a general framework that a) formulates the trade-off
between privacy loss and utility loss from a unified information-theoretic
point of view, and b) delineates quantitative bounds of privacy-utility
trade-off when different protection mechanisms including Randomization,
Sparsity, and Homomorphic Encryption are used. It was shown that in general
\textit{there is no free lunch for the privacy-utility trade-off} and one has

the data distribution may vary but the underlying causal mechanisms remain
constant. When data are divided into distinct environments according to the
heterogeneity, recent invariant learning methods have proposed to learn robust
and invariant models based on this environment partition. It is hence tempting
to utilize the inherent heterogeneity even when environment partition is not
provided. Unfortunately, in this work, we show that learning invariant features
under this circumstance is fundamentally impossible without further inductive
biases or additional information. Then, we propose a framework to jointly learn
environment partition and invariant representation, assisted by additional
auxiliary information. We derive sufficient and necessary conditions for our
framework to provably identify invariant features under a fairly general
setting. Experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets
validate our analysis and demonstrate an improved performance of the proposed
framework over existing methods. Finally, our results also raise the need of
making the role of inductive biases more explicit in future works, when
considering learning invariant models without environment partition. Codes are

construction of new knowledge takes place. This presented enormous challenges
for all actors in the educational process, who had to overcome multiple
difficulties and adapt to a new daily life in which the incorporation of new
strategies and tools was essential. In this work we study the knowledge
acquisition process in two different contexts: face-to-face (before the onset
of the pandemic) and virtual (during confinement), for a particular case in
higher education in Argentina. We developed an analytical model for the
knowledge acquisition process, based on a series of surveys and information on
academic performance. We analyzed the significance of the model by means of
Artificial Neural Networks and a Multiple Linear Regression Method. We found
that the virtual context produced a decrease in motivation to learn. We also
found that the structure of the emerging contact network from peer interaction
presents very different characteristics in both contexts. Finally, we show that
in all cases, interaction with teachers is of utmost importance in the process

  Wavelet-like Transform",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Volumetric image compression has become an urgent task to effectively
transmit and store images produced in biological research and clinical
practice. At present, the most commonly used volumetric image compression
methods are based on wavelet transform, such as JP3D. However, JP3D employs an
ideal, separable, global, and fixed wavelet basis to convert input images from
pixel domain to frequency domain, which seriously limits its performance. In
this paper, we first design a 3-D trained wavelet-like transform to enable
signal-dependent and non-separable transform. Then, an affine wavelet basis is
introduced to capture the various local correlations in different regions of
volumetric images. Furthermore, we embed the proposed wavelet-like transform to
an end-to-end compression framework called aiWave to enable an adaptive
compression scheme for various datasets. Last but not least, we introduce the
weight sharing strategies of the affine wavelet-like transform according to the
volumetric data characteristics in the axial direction to reduce the amount of
parameters. The experimental results show that: 1) when cooperating our trained
3-D affine wavelet-like transform with a simple factorized entropy module,
aiWave performs better than JP3D and is comparable in terms of encoding and
decoding complexities; 2) when adding a context module to further remove signal
redundancy, aiWave can achieve a much better performance than HEVC.

understanding, which aims to identify the unseen open intent while ensuring

there is a lack of an effective approach to obtaining specific and compact

presents an original framework called DA-ADB, which successively learns
distance-aware intent representations and adaptive decision boundaries for open
intent detection. Specifically, we first leverage distance information to
enhance the distinguishing capability of the intent representations. Then, we
design a novel loss function to obtain appropriate decision boundaries by
balancing both empirical and open space risks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distance-aware and boundary

achieves substantial improvements on three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, it
yields robust performance with varying proportions of labeled data and known

annotated a German news corpus on the topic of migration using stance detection
and sentiment analysis. In an experimental evaluation with four different

traditional fossil fuel power plants without carbon capture and storage.
However, at high pressures and in large dilutions of CO2, combustion mechanisms
are poorly understood. Therefore, in this paper sensitivity and quantitative
analysis of four established chemical kinetic mechanisms have been employed to
determine the most important reactions and the best performing mechanisms over
a range of different conditions. CH3O2 chemistry was identified as a pivotal
mechanism component for modelling methane combustion above 200 atm. The

gases, hyperbolic conservation laws arise naturally in the modeling of
conserved quantities of a system, like mass or energy. These types of equations
exhibit highly nonlinear behaviors like shock formation or shock interaction.
In the case of parametrized hyperbolic equations, where, for instance, varying
transport velocities are considered, these nonlinearities and strong transport
effects result in a highly nonlinear solution manifold. This solution manifold
cannot be approximated properly by linear subspaces. To this end, nonlinear
approaches for model order reduction of hyperbolic conservation laws are
required. We propose a new method for nonlinear model order reduction that is
especially well-suited for hyperbolic equations with discontinuous solutions.
The approach is based on a space-time discretization and employs diffeomorphic
transformations of the underlying space-time domain to align the
discontinuities. To derive a reduced model for the diffeomorphisms, the Lie
group structure of the diffeomorphism group is used to associate
diffeomorphisms with corresponding velocity fields via the exponential map. In
the linear space of velocity fields, standard model order reduction techniques,
such as proper orthogonal decomposition, can be applied to extract a reduced
subspace. For a parametrized Burgers' equation with two merging shocks,
numerical experiments show the potential of the approach.

companies and results in higher premiums from clients. Medicare fraud costs
around 13 billion euros in Europe and between 21 billion and 71 billion US
dollars per year in the United States. This study aims to use artificial neural
network based classifiers to predict medicare fraud. The main difficulty using
machine learning techniques in fraud detection or more generally anomaly
detection is that the data sets are highly imbalanced. To detect medicare
frauds, we propose a multiple inputs deep neural network based classifier with
a Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder component. This architecture makes
it possible to take into account many sources of data without mixing them and
makes the classification task easier for the final model. The latent features
extracted from the LSTM autoencoder have a strong discriminating power and
separate the providers into homogeneous clusters. We use the data sets from the
Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) of the US federal government.
The CMS provides publicly available data that brings together all of the cost
price requests sent by American hospitals to medicare companies. Our results
show that although baseline artificial neural network give good performances,
they are outperformed by our multiple inputs neural networks. We have shown
that using a LSTM autoencoder to embed the provider behavior gives better
results and makes the classifiers more robust to class imbalance.

propagation due to the one-phase design. To overcome this, we propose a
two-phase approach that consists of a hypothesis generator and a reasoner. We
first obtain multiple hypotheses, i.e., potential operations to perform the
desired task, through the hypothesis generator. Each hypothesis is then
verified by the reasoner, and the valid one is selected to conduct the final
prediction. The whole system is trained by exploiting raw textual dialogues
without using any reasoning chain annotations. Experimental studies on two
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach not only
achieves better results, but also introduces an interpretable decision process.

however, the Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and deoxygenated blood volume

inference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while
overestimating DBV.
  This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can
infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that
produces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training
data. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV
through a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the
values to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model
is used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.
This model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few
training data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.
  We demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV
maps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through
specification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include
model comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification
for identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study
comparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest. We illustrate that
the proposed approach allows measurement of gray matter differences in OEF and
DBV and enables voxelwise comparison between conditions, where we observe
significant increases in OEF and $R_2^\prime$ during hyperventilation.

X-rays or cosmic-rays) or smaller scale shocks. We suggest that
$L_{\mathrm{H_{2}S}}$ serves as a tracer of the dense gas content, similar to
$L_{\mathrm{HCN}}$, and that the correlation between $L_{\mathrm{H_{2}S}}$ and
$M_{\rm outflow}$(H$_2$) implies a relation between the dense gas reservoir and
the properties and evolution of the molecular feedback. This potential link
requires further study since it holds important keys to our understanding of

of environmental variables is important for risk management and structural
design analysis. When such variables are considered simultaneously,
non-stationarity can exist within both the marginal distributions and
dependence structure, resulting in complex data structures. In the context of
extremes, few methods have been proposed for modelling trends in extremal
dependence, even though capturing this feature is important for quantifying
joint impact. Motivated by the increasing dependence of data from the UK
Climate Projections, we propose a novel semi-parametric modelling framework for
bivariate extremal dependence structures. This framework allows us to capture a
wide variety of dependence trends for data exhibiting asymptotic independence.
When applied to the climate projection dataset, our model is able to capture
observed dependence trends and, in combination with models for marginal
non-stationarity, can be used to produce estimates of bivariate risk measures
at future time points.

degrading the entanglement resources of the protocol. However, despite black

both objects and people affect electromagnetic waves, causing radio and optical

The mechanism by which Cooper pairs are created in non-conventional

The recently discovered superconducting oxide-insulator/KTaO$_3$ interface may
offer clues about its origins. Here we observe distinct dependences of the
superconducting transition temperature Tc on carrier density n$_{2D}$ for
electron gases formed at KTaO$_3$ (111), (001) and (110) interfaces. For the
KTaO$_3$ (111) interface, a remarkable linear dependence of Tc on n$_{2D}$ is
observed over a range of nearly one order of magnitude. Further, our study of
the dependence of superconductivity on gate electric fields reveals the role of
the interface in mediating superconductivity, which also allows for a
reversible electric switching of superconductivity at T = 2 K. We found that
the extreme sensitivity of superconductivity to crystallographic orientation
can be explained by Cooper pairing via inter-orbital interactions induced by
the inversion-breaking transverse optical (TO1) phonons and quantum
confinement. This mechanism is also consistent with the dependence of Tc on
n$_{2D}$ at the KTaO$_3$ (111) interface. Our study may shed light on the

channel estimation is essential and usually requires excessive channel training
overhead when the number of IRS reflecting elements is large. The acquisition

receiver. In this work, we study an IRS-aided wireless communication system
with a time-varying channel model and propose an innovative two-stage
transmission protocol. In the first stage, we send pilot symbols and track the
direct/reflected channels based on the received signal, and then data signals
are transmitted. In the second stage, instead of sending pilot symbols first,
we directly predict the direct/reflected channels and all the time slots are
used for data transmission. Based on the proposed transmission protocol, we
propose a two-stage channel tracking and prediction (2SCTP) scheme to obtain
the direct and reflected channels with low channel training overhead, which is
achieved by exploiting the temporal correlation of the time-varying channels.
Specifically, we first consider a special case where the IRS-access point (AP)
channel is assumed to be static, for which a Kalman filter (KF)-based algorithm

even with a perfect fit to noisy training data [5,45,44]. Since then many
theoretical works have revealed some facets of this phenomenon [4,2,1,8] known
as benign overfitting. In particular, in the linear regression model, the
minimum $l_2$-norm interpolant estimator $\hat\beta$ has received a lot of
attention [1,39] since it was proved to be consistent even though it perfectly
fits noisy data under some condition on the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of the
input vector. Motivated by this phenomenon, we study the generalization
property of this estimator from a geometrical viewpoint. Our main results
extend and improve the convergence rates as well as the deviation probability
from [39]. Our proof differs from the classical bias/variance analysis and is
based on the self-induced regularization property introduced in [2]:
$\hat\beta$ can be written as a sum of a ridge estimator $\hat\beta_{1:k}$ and
an overfitting component $\hat\beta_{k+1:p}$ which follows a decomposition of
the features space $\mathbb{R}^p=V_{1:k}\oplus^\perp V_{k+1:p}$ into the space
$V_{1:k}$ spanned by the top $k$ eigenvectors of $\Sigma$ and the ones
$V_{k+1:p}$ spanned by the $p-k$ last ones. We also prove a matching lower
bound for the expected prediction risk. The two geometrical properties of
random Gaussian matrices at the heart of our analysis are the Dvoretsky-Milman
theorem and isomorphic and restricted isomorphic properties. In particular, the
Dvoretsky dimension appearing naturally in our geometrical viewpoint coincides
with the effective rank from [1,39] and is the key tool to handle the behavior
of the design matrix restricted to the sub-space $V_{k+1:p}$ where overfitting
happens.

embedding tasks, e.g., SimCSE. However, We find that these existing solutions
are heavily affected by superficial features like the length of sentences or
syntactic structures. In this paper, we propose a semantics-aware contrastive
learning framework for sentence embeddings, termed Pseudo-Token BERT (PT-BERT),
which is able to exploit the pseudo-token space (i.e., latent semantic space)
representation of a sentence while eliminating the impact of superficial
features such as sentence length and syntax. Specifically, we introduce an
additional pseudo token embedding layer independent of the BERT encoder to map
each sentence into a sequence of pseudo tokens in a fixed length. Leveraging
these pseudo sequences, we are able to construct same-length positive and
negative pairs based on the attention mechanism to perform contrastive
learning. In addition, we utilize both the gradient-updating and
momentum-updating encoders to encode instances while dynamically maintaining an
additional queue to store the representation of sentence embeddings, enhancing
the encoder's learning performance for negative examples. Experiments show that
our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on six standard semantic
textual similarity (STS) tasks. Furthermore, experiments on alignments and
uniformity losses, as well as hard examples with different sentence lengths and
syntax, consistently verify the effectiveness of our method.

approaches have been popularly applied to handle multi-modal medical data and
achieved impressive performance in various biomedical applications. For disease
prediction tasks, most existing graph-based methods tend to define the graph
manually based on specified modality (e.g., demographic information), and then
integrated other modalities to obtain the patient representation by Graph
Representation Learning (GRL). However, constructing an appropriate graph in
advance is not a simple matter for these methods. Meanwhile, the complex
correlation between modalities is ignored. These factors inevitably yield the
inadequacy of providing sufficient information about the patient's condition
for a reliable diagnosis. To this end, we propose an end-to-end Multi-modal
Graph Learning framework (MMGL) for disease prediction with multi-modality. To
effectively exploit the rich information across multi-modality associated with
the disease, modality-aware representation learning is proposed to aggregate
the features of each modality by leveraging the correlation and complementarity
between the modalities. Furthermore, instead of defining the graph manually,
the latent graph structure is captured through an effective way of adaptive
graph learning. It could be jointly optimized with the prediction model, thus
revealing the intrinsic connections among samples. Our model is also applicable
to the scenario of inductive learning for those unseen data. An extensive group
of experiments on two disease prediction tasks demonstrates that the proposed

high-dimensional parameters of the last two network layers were extracted as

quantum computers. The superiority of superconducting quantum computers over
any classical device in simulating random but well-determined quantum circuits
has already been shown in two independent experiments and important steps have
been taken in quantum error correction. However, the currently wide-spread
qubit designs do not yet provide high enough performance to enable practical
applications or efficient scaling of logical qubits owing to one or several
following issues: sensitivity to charge or flux noise leading to decoherence,
too weak non-linearity preventing fast operations, undesirably dense excitation
spectrum, or complicated design vulnerable to parasitic capacitance. Here, we
introduce and demonstrate a superconducting-qubit type, the unimon, which
combines the desired properties of high non-linearity, full insensitivity to dc
charge noise, insensitivity to flux noise, and a simple structure consisting
only of a single Josephson junction in a resonator. We measure the qubit
frequency, $\omega_{01}/(2\pi)$, and anharmonicity $\alpha$ over the full
dc-flux range and observe, in agreement with our quantum models, that the qubit
anharmonicity is greatly enhanced at the optimal operation point, yielding, for
example, 99.9% and 99.8% fidelity for 13-ns single-qubit gates on two qubits
with $(\omega_{01},\alpha)=(4.49~\mathrm{GHz}, 434~\mathrm{ MHz})\times 2\pi$
and $(3.55~\mathrm{GHz}, 744~\mathrm{ MHz})\times 2\pi$, respectively. The
energy relaxation time $T_1\lesssim 10~\mu\mathrm{s}$ is stable for hours and
seems to be limited by dielectric losses. Thus, future improvements of the
design, materials, and gate time may promote the unimon to break the 99.99%
fidelity target for efficient quantum error correction and possible quantum
advantage with noisy systems.

theoretical results show that by optimizing the Fermi energy and the thickness
of Dirac semimetal, the reflection coefficient ratio can be increased under
p-polarization and s-polarization, thus creating conditions for enhanced PSHE.
In addition, the effects of the incident angle and the parameters of the spacer

more reliable to assess fairness. The problem of causality-based fairness

counterfactual, and path-specific effects) that are not always measurable. This
is known as the identifiability problem and is the topic of a large body of
work in the causal inference literature. This paper is a compilation of the
major identifiability results which are of particular relevance for machine

introduces a control synthesis framework for stochastic NNDMs with performance

interpreted over finite traces (LTLf), and the approach is based on finite

of NNs to formally abstract a NNDM into an interval Markov decision process
(IMDP). Then, a strategy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a given

NNDM. We show that the process of abstracting NNDMs to IMDPs reduces to a set
of convex optimization problems, hence guaranteeing efficiency. We also present
an adaptive refinement procedure that makes the framework scalable. On several

organic ammonium salts, AX, as a surface passivator, where A is a large organic
cation and X is a halide. These surface treatments passivate the perovskite by
forming layered perovskites (e.g., A2PbX4) or by AX itself serving as a surface
passivation agent on the perovskite photoactive film. It remains unclear
whether layered perovskites or AX is the ideal passivator due to an incomplete
understanding of the interfacial impact and resulting photoexcited carrier
dynamics of AX treatment. In the present study, we use TRPL measurements to
selectively probe the different interfaces of glass/perovskite/AX to
demonstrate the vastly distinct interfacial photoexcited state dynamics with
the presence of A2PbX4 or AX. Coupling the TRPL results with X-ray diffraction
and nanoscale microscopy measurements, we find that the presence of AX not only
passivates the traps at the surface and the grain boundaries, but also induces
an {\alpha}/{\delta}-FAPbI3 phase mixing that alters the carrier dynamics near
the glass/perovskite interface and enhances the photoluminescence quantum
yield. In contrast, the passivation with A2PbI4 is mostly localized to the
surface and grain boundaries near the top surface where the availability of
PbI2 directly determines the formation of A2PbI4. Such distinct mechanisms
significantly impact the corresponding solar cell performance, and we find AX
passivation that has not been converted to a layered perovskite allows for a
much larger processing window (e.g., larger allowed variance of AX
concentration which is critical for improving the eventual manufacturing yield)
and more reproducible condition to realize device performance improvements,
while A2PbI4 as a passivator yields a much narrower processing window. We
expect these results to enable a more rational route for developing AX for
perovskite.

Gravitational Waves (GWs) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration remains
debated. One fundamental reason is our ignorance of their host environment, as
the typical size of an event's localization volume can easily contain thousands
of galaxies. A strategy around this is to exploit statistical approaches to
assess the spatial correlation between these mergers and astrophysically
motivated host galaxy types, such as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We use a
Likelihood ratio method to infer the degree of GW-AGN connection out to
$z=0.2$. We simulate BBH mergers whose components' masses are sampled from a
realistic distribution of the underlying population of Black Holes (BHs).
Localization volumes for these events are calculated assuming two different
interferometric network configurations. These correspond to the configuration
of the third (O3) and of the upcoming fourth (O4) LVK observing runs. We
conclude that the 13 BBH mergers detected during the third observing run at
$z\leq0.2$ are not enough to reject with a \(3\sigma\) significance the
hypothesis according to which there is no connection between GW and AGN more
luminous than $\approx 10^{44.3}\rm{erg}\ \rm{s}^{-1}$, that have number
density higher than \(10^{-4.75}\textrm{Mpc}^{-3}\). However, 13 detections are
enough to reject this no-connection hypothesis when rarer categories of AGN are
considered, with bolometric luminosities greater than $\approx
10^{45.5}\rm{erg}\ \rm{s}^{-1}$. We estimate that O4 results will potentially
allow us to test fractional contributions to the total BBH merger population
from AGN of any luminosity higher than \(80\%\).

  Talenti inequality",,,,,"math.OC math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Talenti inequalities are a central feature in the qualitative analysis of PDE
constrained optimal control as well as in calculus of variations. The classical
parabolic Talenti inequality states that if we consider the parabolic equation
${\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}}-\Delta u=f=f(t,x)$ then, replacing, for any
time $t$, $f(t,\cdot)$ with its Schwarz rearrangement $f^\#(t,\cdot)$ increases
the concentration of the solution in the following sense: letting $v$ be the
solution of ${\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}}-\Delta v=f^\#$ in the ball, then
the solution $u$ is less concentrated than $v$. This property can be rephrased
in terms of the existence of a maximal element for a certain order
relationship. It is natural to try and rearrange the source term not only in
space but also in time, and thus to investigate the existence of such a maximal
element when we rearrange the function with respect to the two variables. In
the present paper we prove that this is not possible.

are small in size, recoil imaging only seems to be a practical goal for
micro-pattern gas detectors. This white paper outlines the physics case for
recoil imaging, and puts forward a decadal plan to advance towards the
directional detection of low-energy recoils with sensitivity and resolution
close to fundamental performance limits. The science case covered includes: the
discovery of dark matter into the neutrino fog, directional detection of
sub-MeV solar neutrinos, the precision study of coherent-elastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering, the detection of solar axions, the measurement of
the Migdal effect, X-ray polarimetry, and several other applied physics goals.
We also outline the R&D programs necessary to test concepts that are crucial to
advance detector performance towards their fundamental limit: single primary
electron sensitivity with full 3D spatial resolution at the $\sim$100
micron-scale. These advancements include: the use of negative ion drift,
electron counting with high-definition electronic readout, time projection
chambers with optical readout, and the possibility for nuclear recoil tracking
in high-density gases such as argon. We also discuss the readout and
electronics systems needed to scale-up such detectors to the ton-scale and

and compact way. A graph summary based on equivalence classes preserves
pre-defined features of a graph's vertex within a $k$-hop neighborhood such as
the vertex labels and edge labels. Based on these neighborhood characteristics,
the vertex is assigned to an equivalence class. The calculation of the assigned
equivalence class must be a permutation invariant operation on the pre-defined
features. This is achieved by sorting on the feature values, e. g., the edge
labels, which is computationally expensive, and subsequently hashing the
result. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) fulfill the permutation invariance
requirement. We formulate the problem of graph summarization as a subgraph
classification task on the root vertex of the $k$-hop neighborhood. We adapt
different GNN architectures, both based on the popular message-passing protocol
and alternative approaches, to perform the structural graph summarization task.
We compare different GNNs with a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and
Bloom filter as non-neural method. For our experiments, we consider four
popular graph summary models on a large web graph. This resembles challenging
multi-class vertex classification tasks with the numbers of classes ranging
from $576$ to multiple hundreds of thousands. Our results show that the
performance of GNNs are close to each other. In three out of four experiments,
the non-message-passing GraphMLP model outperforms the other GNNs. The
performance of the standard MLP is extraordinary good, especially in the

architectures by a large margin, except for the dataset with the fewest number

on referential integrity constraints, i.e., key/foreign key pairs. Although
several such systems have been proposed in the literature, most of them only
support queries whose keywords refer to the contents of the target database and
just very few support queries in which keywords refer to elements of the

such queries. To this end, in our work, we first generalize the well-known
concepts of Query Matches (QMs) and Candidate Joining Networks (CJNs) to handle
keywords referring to schema elements and propose new algorithms to generate
them. Then, we introduce an approach to automatically select the CJNs that are
more likely to represent the user intent when issuing a keyword query. This
approach includes two major innovations: a ranking algorithm for selecting

set of experiments performed with query sets and datasets previously used in

indicate that LATHE can handle a wider variety of keyword queries while
remaining highly effective, even for large databases with intricate schemas.

necessitates very high statistical stringency and thus true effects in data are
difficult to detect unless they have high effect sizes. One promising approach
for reducing the multiple testing burden is to use independent information to
prioritize the features most likely to be true effects. However, using the
independent data effectively is challenging and often does not lead to
substantial gains in power. Current state-of-the-art methods sort features into
groups by the independent information and calculate weights for each group.
However, when true effects are weak and rare (the typical situation for high
throughput biological studies), all groups will contain many null tests and
thus their weights are diluted, and performance suffers. We introduce Covariate
Rank Weighting (CRW), a method for calculating approximate optimal weights
conditioned on the ranking of tests by an external covariate. This approach
uses the probabilistic relationship between covariate ranking and test effect
size to calculate individual weights for each test that are more informative
than group weights and are not diluted by null effects. We show how this
relationship can be calculated theoretically for normally distributed
covariates. It can be estimated empirically in other cases. We show via
simulations and applications to data that this method outperforms existing
methods by as much as 10-fold in the rare/low effect size scenario common to
biological data and has at least comparable performance in all scenarios.

they require massive datasets for model training and efficacy of models. Some
of those data requirements can be met with the help of existing datasets within

generate synthetic data from an existing dataset. Further, it is well
established that diversity in generated synthetic data relies on (and is
perhaps limited by) statistical properties of available dataset within a single
organization or entity. The more diverse an existing dataset is, the more
expressive and generic synthetic data can be. However, given the scarcity of
underlying data, it is challenging to collate big data in one organization. The
diverse, non-overlapping dataset across distinct organizations provides an
opportunity for them to contribute their limited distinct data to a larger pool
that can be leveraged to further synthesize. Unfortunately, this raises data
privacy concerns that some institutions may not be comfortable with.
  This paper proposes a novel approach to generate synthetic data - FedSyn.
FedSyn is a collaborative, privacy preserving approach to generate synthetic
data among multiple participants in a federated and collaborative network.
FedSyn creates a synthetic data generation model, which can generate synthetic
data consisting of statistical distribution of almost all the participants in
the network. FedSyn does not require access to the data of an individual
participant, hence protecting the privacy of participant's data. The proposed
technique in this paper leverages federated machine learning and generative
adversarial network (GAN) as neural network architecture for synthetic data
generation. The proposed method can be extended to many machine learning
problem classes in finance, health, governance, technology and many more.

decomposition, the integral is computed over a union of regular boxes (lending
the scheme compatibility with adaptive box codes) and triangular regions (which
may be potentially curved near boundaries). Singular and near-singular
quadrature is handled by converting integrals on volumetric regions to line
integrals bounding a reference volume cell using cell mappings and elements of
the Poincar\'e lemma, followed by leveraging existing one-dimensional
near-singular and singular quadratures appropriate to the singular nature of
the kernel. The scheme achieves compatibility with fast multipole methods
(FMMs) and thereby optimal asymptotic complexity by coupling global rules for
target-independent quadrature of smooth functions to local target-dependent
singular quadrature corrections, and it relies on orthogonal polynomial systems
on each cell for well-conditioned, high-order and efficient (with respect to

volumetric sources. Our domain discretization scheme is naturally compatible
with standard meshing software such as Gmsh, which are employed to discretize a
narrow region surrounding the domain boundaries. We present 8th-order accurate

with strong historical connections to particle physics. This is why most
observations are conducted by experiments with proprietary data and analysis
software, as it is usual in the particle physics field. However in recent
years, this paradigm has been slowly shifting towards the development and use
of open-source data formats and tools, driven by upcoming observatories such as
the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). In this context, a community-driven,
shared data format (the gamma-astro-data-format or GADF) and analysis tools
such as Gammapy and ctools have been developed. So far these efforts have been
led by the IACT community, leaving out other types of ground-based gamma-ray
instruments.We aim to show that the data from ground particle arrays, such as
the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, is also compatible with
the GADF and can thus be fully analysed using the related tools, in this case
Gammapy. We reproduce several published HAWC results using Gammapy and data
products compliant with GADF standard. We also illustrate the capabilities of
the shared format and tools by producing a joint fit of the Crab spectrum
including data from six different gamma-ray experiments. We find excellent
agreement with the reference results, a powerful check of both the published
results and the tools involved. The data from particle detector arrays such as
the HAWC observatory can be adapted to the GADF and thus analysed with Gammapy.
A common data format and shared analysis tools allow multi-instrument joint
analysis and effective data sharing. Given the complementary nature of pointing
and wide-field instruments, this synergy will be distinctly beneficial for the
joint scientific exploitation of future observatories such as the Southern
Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory and CTA.

is imposed to be block-sparse so that the resultant adversarial example differs
from the original sentence in only a few words. Due to the discrete nature of
textual data, we perform gradient projection to find the minimizer of our
proposed optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate that, while our
adversarial attack maintains the semantics of the sentence, it can reduce the
accuracy of GPT-2 to less than 5% on different datasets (AG News, MNLI, and
Yelp Reviews). Furthermore, the block-sparsity constraint of the proposed
optimization problem results in small perturbations in the adversarial example.

of linkage (or variable interaction) learning. This requires, however, that the
linkage model can capture the exploitable structure of a problem. Usually, a
single type of linkage structure is attempted to be captured using models such
as a linkage tree. However, in practice, problems may exhibit multiple linkage
structures. This is for instance the case in multi-objective optimization when
the objectives have different linkage structures. This cannot be modelled
sufficiently well when using linkage models that aim at capturing a single type
of linkage structure, deteriorating the advantages brought by MBEAs. Therefore,
here, we introduce linkage kernels, whereby a linkage structure is learned for
each solution over its local neighborhood. We implement linkage kernels into
the MBEA known as GOMEA that was previously found to be highly scalable when
solving various problems. We further introduce a novel benchmark function
called Best-of-Traps (BoT) that has an adjustable degree of different linkage
structures. On both BoT and a worst-case scenario-based variant of the
well-known MaxCut problem, we experimentally find a vast performance
improvement of linkage-kernel GOMEA over GOMEA with a single linkage tree as
well as the MBEA known as DSMGA-II.

interlinked and are crucial in a wide range of research fields, with their
values affecting observables in atomic, molecular and neutrino physics as well
as metrology. The most precise values for these fundamental parameters come
from Penning-trap mass spectrometry, which achieves relative mass uncertainties
in the range of $10^{-11}$. However, redundancy checks using data from
different experiments reveal significant inconsistencies in the masses of the
proton ($m_p$), the deuteron ($m_d$) and helion ($m_\text{he}$), amounting to
$5$ standard deviations for the term $\Delta=m_p+m_d-m_{\text{he}}$, which
suggests that the uncertainty of these values may have been underestimated.
Here we present results from absolute mass measurements of the deuteron and the
${HD}^+$ molecular ion against $^{12}C$ as a mass reference. Our value for the
deuteron $m_d=2.013\,553\,212\,535 (17)$u supersedes the precision of the
literature value by a factor of $2.4$ and deviates from this by $4.8$ standard
deviations. With a relative uncertainty of $8$ parts per trillion (ppt) this is
the most precise mass value measured directly in atomic mass units.
Furthermore, the measurement of the ${HD}^+$ molecular ion,
$m({HD}^+)=3.021\,378\,241\,561\,(61)$u, not only allows for a rigorous
consistency check of our measurements of the masses of the deuteron (this work)
and proton, but also establishes an additional link for the masses of tritium
and helium-3 to the atomic mass unit. Combined with a recent measurement of the
deuteron-to-proton mass ratio the uncertainty of the reference value of $m_p$
can be reduced by a factor of three. This is a post-peer-review, pre-copyedit

policy from either a numerical state vector or images. Both approaches
generally do not take structural knowledge of the task into account, which is
especially prevalent in robotic applications and can benefit learning if
exploited. This work introduces a neural network architecture that combines
relational inductive bias and visual feedback to learn an efficient position
control policy for robotic manipulation. We derive a graph representation that
models the physical structure of the manipulator and combines the robot's
internal state with a low-dimensional description of the visual scene generated
by an image encoding network. On this basis, a graph neural network trained
with reinforcement learning predicts joint velocities to control the robot. We
further introduce an asymmetric approach of training the image encoder
separately from the policy using supervised learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, for a 2-DoF planar robot in a geometrically simplistic 2D
environment, a learned representation of the visual scene can replace access to
the explicit coordinates of the reaching target without compromising on the
quality and sample efficiency of the policy. We further show the ability of the
model to improve sample efficiency for a 6-DoF robot arm in a visually
realistic 3D environment.

Most of these infrared bubbles form during expansion of HII regions around
massive stars. However, the physical effects that determine their morphology
are still under debate. Namely, the absence of the infrared emission toward the
centres of the bubbles can be explained by pushing the dust grains by stellar
radiation pressure. At the same time, small graphite grains and PAHs are not
strongly affected by the radiation pressure and must be removed by another
process. Stellar ultraviolet emission can destroy the smallest PAHs but the
photodestruction is ineffective for the large PAHs. Meanwhile, the stellar wind
can evacuate all types of grains from HII regions. In the frame of our
chemo-dynamical model we vary parameters of the stellar wind and illustrate
their influence on the morphology and synthetic infrared images of the bubbles.

different from their Cold Dark Matter (CDM) counterparts and do not converge to
the latter in the semiclassical limit. In contrast with the familiar CDM
hierarchical collapse, they correspond to an inverse-hierarchy blow-up.
Constant-mass shells start in the nonlinear regime, at early times, with small
radii and high densities, and expand to reach at late times the Hubble flow, up
to small linear perturbations. Thus, larger masses become linear first. This
blow-up approximately follows the Hubble expansion, so that the central density
contrast remains constant with time, although the width of the self-similar
profile shrinks in comoving coordinates. As in a gravitational cooling process,
matter is ejected from the central peaks through successive clumps. As in wave
systems, the velocities of the geometrical structures and of the matter do not
coincide, and matter slowly moves from one clump to the next, with intermittent
velocity bursts at the transitions. These features are best observed using the
density-velocity representation of the nonrelativistic scalar field, or the
mass-shell trajectories, than with the Husimi phase-space distribution, where
an analogue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle blurs the resolution in the
position or velocity direction. These behaviours are due to the quantum
pressure and the wavelike properties of the Schr\""odinger equation. Although
the latter has been used as an alternative to N-body simulations for CDM, these
self-similar solutions show that the semiclassical limit needs to be handled
with care.

networks (LBSNs) can potentially mitigate such issues due to the relatively low

GL-orientations of arbitrary ring spectra correspond to theories of Chern

objects of interest in the robot's environment. Frequently, these tasks involve
articulating objects such as opening or closing a valve. However, existing
human-in-the-loop methods for registering objects do not consider articulations
and the corresponding impact to the geometry of the object, which can cause the
methods to fail. In this work, we present an approach where the registration
system attempts to automatically determine the object model, pose, and
articulation for user-selected points using nonlinear fitting and the iterative
closest point algorithm. When the fitting is incorrect, the operator can
iteratively intervene with corrections after which the system will refit the
object. We present an implementation of our fitting procedure for one
degree-of-freedom (DOF) objects with revolute joints and evaluate it with a
user study that shows that it can improve user performance, in measures of time
on task and task load, ease of use, and usefulness compared to a manual
registration approach. We also present a situated example that integrates our
method into an end-to-end system for articulating a remote valve.

external magnetic field has been a subject of experimental and theoretical
research. The inversion of Landau levels that accommodates the quantum spin
Hall effect is destroyed at a critical magnetic field, and a trivial insulating
gap appears in the spectrum for stronger fields. In this work, we report the
absence of this transport gap in disordered two dimensional topological
insulators in perpendicular magnetic fields of up to 16 T. Instead, we observe
that a topological edge channel (from band inversion) coexists with a
counterpropagating quantum Hall edge channel for magnetic fields at which the
transition to the insulating regime is expected. For larger fields, we observe
only the quantum Hall edge channel with transverse resistance close to $h/e^2$.
By tuning the disorder using different fabrication processes, we find evidence
that this unexpected $\nu=1$ plateau originates from extended quantum Hall edge
channels along a continuous network of charge puddles at the edges of the
device.

approaches to improve the robustness of deep neural networks. It is formalized
as a min-max optimization over model weights and adversarial perturbations,
where the weights can be optimized through gradient descent methods like SGD.
In this paper, we show that treating model weights as random variables allows
for enhancing adversarial training through \textbf{S}econd-Order
\textbf{S}tatistics \textbf{O}ptimization (S$^2$O) with respect to the weights.
By relaxing a common (but unrealistic) assumption of previous PAC-Bayesian
frameworks that all weights are statistically independent, we derive an
improved PAC-Bayesian adversarial generalization bound, which suggests that
optimizing second-order statistics of weights can effectively tighten the
bound. In addition to this theoretical insight, we conduct an extensive set of
experiments, which show that S$^2$O not only improves the robustness and
generalization of the trained neural networks when used in isolation, but also
integrates easily in state-of-the-art adversarial training techniques like
TRADES, AWP, MART, and AVMixup, leading to a measurable improvement of these

their knowledge is critical for many different astrophysical fields. One of the
most extended techniques for estimating these variables are the so-called
empirical relations. In this work we propose a group of state-of-the-art AI
regression models, with the aim of studying their proficiency in estimating
stellar masses and radii. We publicly release the database, the AI models, and
an online tool for stellar mass and radius estimation to the community. We use
a sample of 726 MS stars in the literature with accurate M, R, T_eff, L, log g,
and [Fe/H]. We have split our data sample into training and testing sets and
then analyzed the different AI techniques with them. In particular, we have
experimentally evaluated the accuracy of the following models: Linear Reg.,
Bayesian Reg., Regression Trees, Random Forest, Support-Vector Reg. (SVR),
Neural Networks, kNN, and Stacking. We propose a series of experiments designed
to evaluate the accuracy of the estimations. We have also analyzed the impact
of reducing the number of inputs parameters and compared our results with those
from state-of-the-art empirical relations in the literature. We have found that
a Stacking of several regression models is the most suitable technique for
estimating masses and radii. In the case of the mass, Neural Networks also
provide precise results, and for the radius, SVR and Neural Networks work too.
When comparing with other state-of-the-art empirical relations based models,
our Stacking improves the accuracy by a factor of two for both variables. In
addition, bias is reduced to one order of magnitude in the case of the stellar
mass. Finally, we have found that using our Stacking and only T_eff and L as
input features, the accuracies obtained are slightly larger than a 5%, with a
bias approx 1.5%.

increasing in-plane effective mass as we go far from the Fermi level. We notice
a considerable decrease in the energy gaps and the effective masses of the
heavy-holes in the k$_x$-k$_y$ plane compared to the bulk phases of the parent

mitigate the potential negative impact of adversarial attacks against task
predictions. This work analyzes adversarial attacks from a different
perspective. Namely, adversarial examples contain implicit information that is
useful to the predictions i.e., image classification, and treat the adversarial
attacks against DNNs for data self-expression as extracted abstract
representations that are capable of facilitating specific learning tasks. We
propose an algorithmic framework that leverages the advantages of the DNNs for
data self-expression and task-specific predictions, to improve image
classification. The framework jointly learns a DNN for attacking Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) networks and a DNN for classification, coined as Attacking
VAE for Improve Classification (AVIC). The experiment results show that AVIC
can achieve higher accuracy on standard datasets compared to the training with
clean examples and the traditional adversarial training.

processing efficiency because of discrete event-based (i.e., spike)
computation. Several Machine Learning (ML) applications use biologically
inspired plasticity mechanisms as unsupervised learning techniques to increase
the robustness of ASNNs while preserving efficiency. Spike Time Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) and Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) (i.e., dynamic spiking
threshold adaptation) are two such mechanisms that have been combined to form
an ensemble learning method. However, it is not clear how this ensemble
learning should be regulated based on spiking activity. Moreover, previous
studies have attempted threshold based synaptic pruning following STDP, to
increase inference efficiency at the cost of performance in ASNNs. However,
this type of structural adaptation, that employs individual weight mechanisms,
does not consider spiking activity for pruning which is a better representation
of input stimuli. We envisaged that plasticity-based spike-regulation and
spike-based pruning will result in ASSNs that perform better in low resource
situations. In this paper, a novel ensemble learning method based on entropy
and network activation is introduced, which is amalgamated with a spike-rate
neuron pruning technique, operated exclusively using spiking activity. Two
electroencephalography (EEG) datasets are used as the input for classification
experiments with a three-layer feed forward ASNN trained using one-pass
learning. During the learning process, we observed neurons assembling into a
hierarchy of clusters based on spiking rate. It was discovered that pruning
lower spike-rate neuron clusters resulted in increased generalization or a
predictable decline in performance.

emergence of lineages with increased fitness. For most of these variants,
quantitative information is scarce on epidemiological quantities such as the
incubation period and generation time, which are critical for both public
health decisions and scientific research. Method. We analyzed a dataset
collected during contact tracing activities in the province of Reggio Emilia,
Italy, throughout 2021. We determined the distributions of the incubation
period using information on negative PCR tests and the date of last exposure
from 282 symptomatic cases. We estimated the distributions of the intrinsic
generation time (the time between the infection dates of an infector and its
secondary cases under a fully susceptible population) using a Bayesian
inference approach applied to 4,435 SARS-CoV-2 cases clustered in 1,430
households where at least one secondary case was recorded. Results. We
estimated a mean incubation period of 4.9 days (95% credible intervals, CrI,
4.4-5.4; 95 percentile of the mean distribution: 1-12) for Alpha and 4.5 days
(95%CrI 4.0-5.0; 95 percentile: 1-10) for Delta. The intrinsic generation time
was estimated to have a mean of 6.0 days (95% CrI 5.6-6.4; 95 percentile: 1-15)
for Alpha and of 6.6 days (95%CrI 6.0-7.3; 95 percentile: 1-18) for Delta. The
household serial interval was 2.6 days (95%CrI 2.4-2.7) for Alpha and 2.4 days
(95%CrI 2.2-2.6) for Delta, and the estimated proportion of pre-symptomatic
transmission was 54-55% for both variants. Conclusions. These results indicate
limited differences in the incubation period and intrinsic generation time of
SARS-CoV-2 variants Alpha and Delta compared to ancestral lineages.

(RTB) are two major ways to sell impressions for a publisher. For large
publishers, simultaneously selling impressions through both guaranteed
contracts and in-house RTB has become a popular choice. Generally speaking, a
publisher needs to derive an impression allocation strategy between guaranteed
contracts and RTB to maximize its overall outcome (e.g., revenue and/or
impression quality). However, deriving the optimal strategy is not a trivial
task, e.g., the strategy should encourage incentive compatibility in RTB and
tackle common challenges in real-world applications such as unstable traffic
patterns (e.g., impression volume and bid landscape changing). In this paper,
we formulate impression allocation as an auction problem where each guaranteed
contract submits virtual bids for individual impressions. With this
formulation, we derive the optimal bidding functions for the guaranteed
contracts, which result in the optimal impression allocation. In order to
address the unstable traffic pattern challenge and achieve the optimal overall
outcome, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method to adjust the
bids from each guaranteed contract, which is simple, converging efficiently and
scalable. The experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

coordinating mechanism between the utility company and the electricity
consumers in terms of key decision makings. The load decomposition is therefore
crucial to reveal the underlying relationship between the load consumption and
its characteristics. However, load decomposition is conventionally performed on
the residential and commercial loads, and adequate consideration has not been
given to the high-energy-consuming industrial loads leading to inefficient
results. This paper thus focuses on the load decomposition of the industrial
park loads (IPL). The commonly used parameters in a conventional method are
however inapplicable in high-energy-consuming industrial loads. Therefore, a
more robust approach is developed comprising a three-algorithm model to achieve
this goal on the IPL. First, the improved variational mode decomposition (IVMD)
algorithm is introduced to denoise the training data of the IPL and improve its
stability. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and simple
recurrent units (SRU) joint algorithms are used to achieve a non-intrusive and
non-invasive decomposition process of the IPL using a double-layer deep
learning network based on the IPL characteristics. Specifically, CNN is used to
extract the IPL data characteristics while the improved long and short-term
memory (LSTM) network, SRU, is adopted to develop the decomposition model and
further train the load data. Through the robust decomposition process, the
underlying relationship in the load consumption is extracted. The results
obtained from the numerical examples show that this approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art in the conventional decomposition process.

EV owners have a certain limited willingness to walk between charging stations
and POIs. To address our research question, we propose the use of web mining:
we characterize the influence of different POIs from OpenStreetMap on the
utilization of charging stations. For this, we present a tailored interpretable
model that takes into account the full spatial distributions of both the POIs
and the charging stations. This allows us then to estimate the distance and
magnitude of the influence of different POI types. We evaluate our model with
data from approx. 300 charging stations and 4,000 POIs in Amsterdam,
Netherlands. Our model achieves a superior performance over state-of-the-art
baselines and, on top of that, is able to offer an unmatched level of

crypto-assets is growing. According to Chainalysis, in 2021, approx. $14
billion has been lost due to various incidents, and this number is dominated by
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. In order to address these issues,
one can use a collection of tools ranging from auditing to formal methods. We
use formal verification and provide the first formalisation of a DeFi contract
in a foundational proof assistant capturing contract interactions. We focus on
Dexter2, a decentralized, non-custodial exchange for the Tezos network similar
to Uniswap on Ethereum. The Dexter implementation consists of several smart
contracts. This poses unique challenges for formalisation due to the complex
contract interactions. Our formalisation includes proofs of functional
correctness with respect to an informal specification for the contracts
involved in Dexter's implementation. Moreover, our formalisation is the first
to feature proofs of safety properties of the interacting smart contracts of a
decentralized exchange. We have extracted our contract from Coq into CameLIGO
code, so it can be deployed on the Tezos blockchain. Uniswap and Dexter are
paradigmatic for a collection of similar contracts. Our methodology thus allows
us to implement and verify DeFi applications featuring similar interaction
patterns.

years, people are investing in stock markets to earn as much profit as possible
from the amount of money that they possess. Hence, it is vital to have a
prediction model which can accurately predict future stock prices. With the
help of machine learning, it is not an impossible task as the various machine
learning techniques if modeled properly may be able to provide the best
prediction values. This would enable the investors to decide whether to buy,
sell or hold the share. The aim of this paper is to predict the future of the
financial stocks of a company with improved accuracy. In this paper, we have
proposed the use of historical as well as sentiment data to efficiently predict
stock prices by applying LSTM. It has been found by analyzing the existing
research in the area of sentiment analysis that there is a strong correlation
between the movement of stock prices and the publication of news articles.
Therefore, in this paper, we have integrated these factors to predict the stock
prices more accurately.

  Explaining Extreme Pricing Anomalies","72 pages",,,,"q-fin.ST cs.CL cs.LG cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extreme pricing anomalies may occur unexpectedly without a trivial cause, and
equity traders typically experience a meticulous process to source disparate
information and analyze its reliability before integrating it into the trusted
knowledge base. We introduce DeepTrust, a reliable financial knowledge
retrieval framework on Twitter to explain extreme price moves at speed, while
ensuring data veracity using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. Our proposed
framework consists of three modules, specialized for anomaly detection,
information retrieval and reliability assessment. The workflow starts with
identifying anomalous asset price changes using machine learning models trained
with historical pricing data, and retrieving correlated unstructured data from
Twitter using enhanced queries with dynamic search conditions. DeepTrust
extrapolates information reliability from tweet features, traces of generative
language model, argumentation structure, subjectivity and sentiment signals,
and refine a concise collection of credible tweets for market insights. The
framework is evaluated on two self-annotated financial anomalies, i.e., Twitter
and Facebook stock price on 29 and 30 April 2021. The optimal setup outperforms
the baseline classifier by 7.75% and 15.77% on F0.5-scores, and 10.55% and
18.88% on precision, respectively, proving its capability in screening
unreliable information precisely. At the same time, information retrieval and
reliability assessment modules are analyzed individually on their effectiveness
and causes of limitations, with identified subjective and objective factors
that influence the performance. As a collaborative project with Refinitiv, this
framework paves a promising path towards building a scalable commercial
solution that assists traders to reach investment decisions on pricing
anomalies with authenticated knowledge from social media platforms in
real-time.

demonstrated in learning several transient PDEs, especially the Navier-Stokes
equations, and successfully applied to solve problems with quite different
domains and boundaries, including the internal flow, the external flow, and
remarkably, the flow across the cascade of airfoils. In these applications, our
LNOs are faster than the conventional numerical solver by over 1000 times,
which could be significant for scientific computations and engineering

features for the task at hand automatically from large corpora of data. We
structure our analysis of deep learning methods along three categories: word
embeddings, sequential models, and attention-based methods. Deep learning
impacted ASAG differently than other fields of NLP, as we noticed that the
learned representations alone do not contribute to achieve the best results,
but they rather show to work in a complementary way with hand-engineered
features. The best performance are indeed achieved by methods that combine the
carefully hand-engineered features with the power of the semantic descriptions
provided by the latest models, like transformers architectures. We identify
challenges and provide an outlook on research direction that can be addressed

representative task is the International Classification of Disease (ICD)
diagnosis code assignment. Existing work adopts either RNN or CNN as the
backbone network because the vanilla BERT cannot handle well long documents
(>2000 to kens). One issue shared across all these approaches is that they are
over specific to the ICD code assignment task, losing generality to give the
whole document-level and sentence-level embedding. As a result, it is not
straight-forward to direct them to other downstream NLU tasks. Motivated by
these observations, we propose Medical Document BERT (MDBERT) for long medical
document understanding tasks. MDBERT is not only effective in learning
representations at different levels of semantics but efficient in encoding long
documents by leveraging a bottom-up hierarchical architecture. Compared to
vanilla BERT solutions: 1, MDBERT boosts the performance up to relatively 20%
on the MIMIC-III dataset, making it comparable to current SOTA solutions; 2, it
cuts the computational complexity on self-attention modules to less than 1/100.
Other than the ICD code assignment, we conduct a variety of other NLU tasks on
a large commercial dataset named as TrialTrove, to showcase MDBERT's strength
in delivering different levels of semantics.
