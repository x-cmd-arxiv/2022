systems using a polynomially filtered exact diagonalization (POLFED) algorithm.
We focus on disordered kicked Ising model and quantitatively demonstrate that
finite size effects at the MBL transition are less severe than in the random
field XXZ spin chains widely studied in the context of MBL. Our conclusions
extend also to other disordered Floquet models, indicating smaller finite size
effects than those observed in the usually considered disordered autonomous
spin chains. We observe consistent signatures of the transition to MBL phase
for several indicators of ergodicity breaking in the kicked Ising model.
Moreover, we show that an assumption of a power-law divergence of the
correlation length at the MBL transition yields a critical exponent $\nu
\approx 2$, consistent with the Harris criterion for 1D disordered systems.

are often deployed in dangerous environments. It is therefore necessary to
include a methodology to assess robot failure rates to reduce the requirement
for costly human intervention. A solution to this problem includes robots with
the ability to work together to ensure mission resilience. To prevent this
intervention, robots should be able to work together to ensure mission
resilience. However, robotic platforms generally lack built-in
interconnectivity with other platforms from different vendors. This work aims
to tackle this issue by enabling the functionality through a bidirectional
digital twin. The twin enables the human operator to transmit and receive
information to and from the multi-robot fleet. This digital twin considers
mission resilience and autonomous and human-led decision making to enable the
resilience of a multi-robot fleet. This creates the cooperation, corroboration,
and collaboration of diverse robots to leverage the capability of robots and
support recovery of a failed robot.

training data preparation for deep learning in real-world object detection.
While a few previous studies tried to automatically generate 3D bounding boxes
from weak labels such as 2D boxes, the quality is sub-optimal compared to human
annotators. This work proposes a novel autolabeler, called multimodal attention
point generator (MAP-Gen), that generates high-quality 3D labels from weak 2D
boxes. It leverages dense image information to tackle the sparsity issue of 3D
point clouds, thus improving label quality. For each 2D pixel, MAP-Gen predicts
its corresponding 3D coordinates by referencing context points based on their
2D semantic or geometric relationships. The generated 3D points densify the
original sparse point clouds, followed by an encoder to regress 3D bounding
boxes. Using MAP-Gen, object detection networks that are weakly supervised by
2D boxes can achieve 94~99% performance of those fully supervised by 3D
annotations. It is hopeful this newly proposed MAP-Gen autolabeling flow can
shed new light on utilizing multimodal information for enriching sparse point
clouds.

considering the marriage of everyday virtual reality and head-mounted displays,
eye tracking is an emerging technology that helps to assess human behaviors in
a real time and non-intrusive way. Still, multiple aspects need to be
researched before these technologies become widely available in daily life.
Firstly, attention and cognition models in everyday scenarios should be
thoroughly understood. Secondly, as eyes are related to visual biometrics,
privacy preserving methodologies are necessary. Lastly, instead of studies or
applications utilizing limited human participants with relatively homogeneous
characteristics, protocols and use-cases for making such technology more
accessible should be essential. In this work, taking the aforementioned points
into account, a significant scientific push towards everyday virtual reality

often needs to be made in capturing the dynamics of the high wavenumbers. This
problem becomes especially challenging when the system of interest exhibits
shocks or chaotic dynamics. We present a data-driven modeling method that
accurately captures shocks and chaotic dynamics by proposing a novel
architecture, stabilized neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). In our
proposed architecture, we learn the right-hand-side (RHS) of an ODE by adding
the outputs of two NN together where one learns a linear term and the other a
nonlinear term. Specifically, we implement this by training a sparse linear
convolutional NN to learn the linear term and a dense fully-connected nonlinear
NN to learn the nonlinear term. This is in contrast with the standard neural
ODE which involves training only a single NN for learning the RHS. We apply
this setup to the viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits shocked behavior,
and show better short-time tracking and prediction of the energy spectrum at
high wavenumbers than a standard neural ODE. We also find that the stabilized
neural ODE models are much more robust to noisy initial conditions than the
standard neural ODE approach. We also apply this method to chaotic trajectories
of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. In this case, stabilized neural ODEs keep
long-time trajectories on the attractor, and are highly robust to noisy initial
conditions, while standard neural ODEs fail at achieving either of these
results. We conclude by demonstrating how stabilizing neural ODEs provide a
natural extension for use in reduced-order modeling by projecting the dynamics
onto the eigenvectors of the learned linear term.

can account for the discrepancy between the experimental result for the

from the EW sector, with the colored sector of the MSSM taken to be heavy. We
investigate five scenarios, distinguished by the mechanisms which yield a relic
DM density in agreement with the latest Planck bounds. We find that with the
new $(g-2)_{\mu}$ result taken into account and depending on the scenario,
values up to $M_W^{\mathrm{MSSM}} \lesssim 80.376~\mathrm{GeV}$ are reached.
The largest values are obtained for wino DM and in the case of slepton

demonstrate that future $M_W$ measurements, e.g. at the ILC, could distinguish
between various MSSM realizations. Sizable contributions to

renders a full reconstruction of the quantum state prohibitively demanding in
terms of the number of necessary measurements. Here we propose and implement an
efficient scheme for quantum state tomography using active learning. Based on a
few initial measurements, the active learning protocol proposes the next
measurement basis, designed to yield the maximum information gain. We apply the
active learning quantum state tomography scheme to reconstruct different
multi-qubit states with varying degree of entanglement as well as to ground
states of the XXZ model in 1D and a kinetically constrained spin chain. In all
cases, we obtain a significantly improved reconstruction as compared to a
reconstruction based on the exact same number of measurements and measurement
configurations, but with randomly chosen basis configurations. Our scheme is
highly relevant to gain physical insights in quantum many-body systems as well

works took data-driven approaches that utilize large human motion datasets to
tackle this under-determined problem. Still, challenges remain such as temporal
consistency, drifting of global and joint motions, and diverse coverage of
motion types on various terrains. We propose a novel method to simultaneously

history, 2. a simple yet general learning target named ""stationary body points""
(SBPs) which can be stably predicted by the Transformer model and utilized by
analytical routines to correct joint and global drifting, and 3. an algorithm
to generate regularized terrain height maps from noisy SBP predictions which
can in turn correct noisy global motion estimation. We evaluate our framework
extensively on synthesized and real IMU data, and with real-time live demos,

optimal decoupling capacitor (decap) design to maximize the reduction of PDN
self- and transfer impedance seen at multiple ports. An attention-based
transformer network is implemented to directly parameterize decap optimization
policy. The optimality performance is significantly improved since the
attention mechanism has powerful expression to explore massive combinatorial
space for decap assignments. Moreover, it can capture sequential relationships
between the decap assignments. The computing time for optimization is
dramatically reduced due to the reusable network on positions of probing ports
and decap assignment candidates. This is because the transformer network has a
context embedding process to capture meta-features including probing ports
positions. In addition, the network is trained with randomly generated data
sets. Therefore, without additional training, the trained network can solve new
decap optimization problems. The computing time for training and data cost are
critically decreased due to the scalability of the network. Thanks to its
shared weight property, the network can adapt to a larger scale of problems
without additional training. For verification, we compare the results with
conventional genetic algorithm (GA), random search (RS), and all the previous

current model-independent $\tilde{\tau}$ limits comes from analyses performed
at LEP but they suffer from the limited energy of this facility. Limits

to be upgraded to 500 GeV, and possibly to 1 TeV at a later stage. ILC will be
a powerful facility for SUSY searches. The capability of the ILC for

with the $\tilde{\tau}$ and the Lightest SUSY Particle (the LSP) quite close in

statements are generally expected to be equivalent. Moreover, the condition
that the set contains a line (segment) in every direction is often relaxed by
requiring a line (segment) for a ""large"" set of directions only, where large

  Version","Accepted at ICDE 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Traffic time series forecasting is challenging due to complex spatio-temporal
dynamics time series from different locations often have distinct patterns; and
for the same time series, patterns may vary across time, where, for example,
there exist certain periods across a day showing stronger temporal
correlations. Although recent forecasting models, in particular deep learning
based models, show promising results, they suffer from being spatio-temporal
agnostic. Such spatio-temporal agnostic models employ a shared parameter space
irrespective of the time series locations and the time periods and they assume
that the temporal patterns are similar across locations and do not evolve
across time, which may not always hold, thus leading to sub-optimal results. In
this work, we propose a framework that aims at turning spatio-temporal agnostic
models to spatio-temporal aware models. To do so, we encode time series from
different locations into stochastic variables, from which we generate
location-specific and time-varying model parameters to better capture the
spatio-temporal dynamics. We show how to integrate the framework with canonical
attentions to enable spatio-temporal aware attentions. Next, to compensate for
the additional overhead introduced by the spatio-temporal aware model parameter
generation process, we propose a novel window attention scheme, which helps
reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, making spatio-temporal aware

partitioning of the Kohn-Sham electron density required by MBD models to obtain
the atom-in-molecules volumes used by the Tkatchenko-Scheffler polarizability
rescaling. The resulting DNN-MBD model is trained with minimal basis iterative
Stockholder atomic volumes and, coupled to Density Functional Theory (DFT),
exhibits comparable (if not greater) accuracy to other approaches based on
different partitioning schemes. Implemented in the Tinker-HP package, the
DNN-MBD model decreases the overall computational cost compared to MBD models
where the explicit density partitioning is performed. Its coupling with the
recently introduced Stochastic formulation of the MBD equations (J. Chem.
Theory. Comput., 2022, 18, 3, 1633-1645) enables large routine
dispersion-corrected DFT calculations at preserved accuracy. Furthermore, the

from an internal energy depot and transduces it into work performed on the

differences from other models for collective behaviour in active matter

dominated by mechanical forces mediated by their physical attachments through
type IV pili (T4P) and through the production of ""slime"", a complex mixture of
non-diffusible polysaccharides deposited by cells that acts to decrease
friction locally. The slime, in particular, adds a component to the interaction
that is local in space but non-local in time, perhaps most comparable to the

accurate location of the targets is found. For estimating the actual number of

Here, we focus on CO hydrogenation on Rh catalysts with the possible products
methane, acetaldehyde, ethanol and water. This reaction has already been
subject to a number of experimental and theoretical studies with conflicting
views on the factors controlling activity and selectivity towards the more
valuable higher oxygenates. Using accelerated first-principles kinetic Monte
Carlo (KMC) simulations and explicitly and systematically accounting for
adsorbate-adsorbate interactions through a cluster expansion approach, we model
the reaction on the low-index Rh(111) and stepped Rh(211) surfaces. We find
that the Rh(111) facet is selective towards methane, while the Rh(211) facet
exhibits a similar selectivity towards methane and acetaldehyde. This is
consistent with the experimental selectivity observed for larger, predominantly
(111)-exposing Rh nanoparticles and resolves the discrepancy to earlier
first-principles MFA microkinetic work that found the Rh(111) facet to be
selective towards acetaldehyde. While the latter work tried to approximately
account for lateral interactions through coverage-dependent rate expressions,
our analysis demonstrates that this fails to sufficiently capture concomitant
correlations among the adsorbed reaction intermediates that crucially determine
the overall selectivity.

characteristics that will later be affected by the active sampling method, and
validating which suggestions from undersampling or oversampling techniques are

undersampling/oversampling a specific class, we allow users to find and sample
easy and difficult to classify training instances from all classes. Users can
explore subsets of data from different perspectives to decide all those
parameters, while HardVis keeps track of their steps and evaluates the model's
predictive performance in a test set separately. The end result is a
well-balanced data set that boosts the predictive power of the ML model. The
efficacy and effectiveness of HardVis are demonstrated with a hypothetical

observe independent and identically distributed (i.\,i.\,d) data. The
traditional approach aims to find a graphical representation that encodes the
same set of conditional independence relationships as those present in the
observed distribution. It is known that under i.\,i.\,d assumption, even with
infinite data, there is a limit to how fine-grained a causal structure we can
identify. To overcome this limitation, recent work has explored using data
originating from different, related environments to learn richer causal
structure. These approaches implicitly rely on the independent causal
mechanisms (ICM) principle, which postulates that the mechanism giving rise to
an effect given its causes and the mechanism which generates the causes do not
inform or influence each other. Thus, components of the causal model can
independently change from environment to environment. Despite its wide

statistical formalization of the ICM principle and how it enables
identification of richer causal structures from grouped data. Here we present
new causal de Finetti theorems which offer a first statistical formalization of

variational autoencoders (VAEs), is important to yield more expressive models
and interpretable representations, and to avoid overfitting. One way to achieve
this objective is to impose a sparsity constraint on the latent variables,
e.g., via a Laplace prior. However, such approaches usually complicate the
training phase, and they sacrifice the reconstruction quality to promote
sparsity. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective methodology to
structure the latent space via a sparsity-promoting dictionary model, which
assumes that each latent code can be written as a sparse linear combination of
a dictionary's columns. In particular, we leverage a computationally efficient
and tuning-free method, which relies on a zero-mean Gaussian latent prior with
learnable variances. We derive a variational inference scheme to train the
model. Experiments on speech generative modeling demonstrate the advantage of
the proposed approach over competing techniques, since it promotes sparsity
while not deteriorating the output speech quality.

challenging problem. Recent works achieve good performance relying on a large
amount of expensive-to-obtain labeled data. To reduce the amount of
supervision, we for the first time propose a general framework, FisherMatch,
for semi-supervised rotation regression, without assuming any domain-specific
knowledge or paired data. Inspired by the popular semi-supervised approach,
FixMatch, we propose to leverage pseudo label filtering to facilitate the
information flow from labeled data to unlabeled data in a teacher-student
mutual learning framework. However, incorporating the pseudo label filtering
mechanism into semi-supervised rotation regression is highly non-trivial,
mainly due to the lack of a reliable confidence measure for rotation
prediction. In this work, we propose to leverage matrix Fisher distribution to
build a probabilistic model of rotation and devise a matrix Fisher-based
regressor for jointly predicting rotation along with its prediction
uncertainty. We then propose to use the entropy of the predicted distribution
as a confidence measure, which enables us to perform pseudo label filtering for
rotation regression. For supervising such distribution-like pseudo labels, we
further investigate the problem of how to enforce loss between two matrix
Fisher distributions. Our extensive experiments show that our method can work
well even under very low labeled data ratios on different benchmarks, achieving
significant and consistent performance improvement over supervised learning and
other semi-supervised learning baselines. Our project page is at

expected to significantly contribute to the transportation system's safety and
efficiency. Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), a major cooperative
driving application, has been the subject of many studies in recent years. The
primary motivation behind using CACC is to reduce traffic congestion and
improve traffic flow, traffic throughput, and highway capacity. Since the
information flow between cooperative vehicles can significantly affect the
dynamics of a platoon, the design and performance of control components are
tightly dependent on the communication component performance. In addition, the
choice of Information Flow Topology (IFT) can affect certain platoons
properties such as stability and scalability. Although cooperative vehicles
perception can be expanded to multiple predecessors information by using V2X
communication, the communication technologies still suffer from scalability
issues. Therefore, cooperative vehicles are required to predict each other's
behavior to compensate for the effects of non-ideal communication. The notion
of Model-Based Communication (MBC) was proposed to enhance cooperative vehicles
perception under non-ideal communication by introducing a new flexible content
structure for broadcasting joint vehicles dynamic/drivers behavior models. By
utilizing a non-parametric (Bayesian) modeling scheme, i.e., Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR), and the MBC concept, this paper develops a discrete hybrid
stochastic model predictive control approach and examines the impact of
communication losses and different information flow topologies on the
performance and safety of the platoon. The results demonstrate an improvement
in response time and safety using more vehicles information, validating the
potential of cooperation to attenuate disturbances and improve traffic flow and
safety.

systematic postcondition checks, which allows a common grammar to learn
solutions to different tasks using only environmental cues and BT feedback. The
static performance of learned behaviors is poor because no agent learns all

techniques in recommendation systems. In recent years, Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based CF models, such as NGCF [31], LightGCN [10] and GTN [9] have
achieved tremendous success and significantly advanced the state-of-the-art.
While there is a rich literature of such works using advanced models for
learning user and item representations separately, item recommendation is
essentially a link prediction problem between users and items. Furthermore,
while there have been early works employing link prediction for collaborative
filtering [5, 6], this trend has largely given way to works focused on
aggregating information from user and item nodes, rather than modeling links
directly. In this paper, we propose a new linkage (connectivity) score for
bipartite graphs, generalizing multiple standard link prediction methods. We
combine this new score with an iterative degree update process in the user-item
interaction bipartite graph to exploit local graph structures without any node
modeling. The result is a simple, non-deep learning model with only six
learnable parameters. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate our approach
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art GNN-based CF approaches on
four widely used benchmarks. In particular, on Amazon-Book, we demonstrate an
over 60% improvement for both Recall and NDCG. We hope our work would invite
the community to revisit the link prediction aspect of collaborative filtering,
where significant performance gains could be achieved through aligning link
prediction with item recommendations.

imaging, as most deep-learning based solutions suffer from it. In practice,
domain shifts are tackled by performing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA),
where a model is adapted to an unlabelled target domain by leveraging the
labelled source data. In medical scenarios, the data comes with huge privacy
concerns making it difficult to apply standard UDA techniques. Hence, a closer
clinical setting is Source-Free UDA (SFUDA), where we have access to
source-trained model but not the source data during adaptation. Existing SFUDA
methods rely on pseudo-label based self-training techniques to address the
domain shift. However, these pseudo-labels often have high entropy due to
domain shift and adapting the source model with noisy pseudo-labels leads to
sub-optimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a systematic
two-stage approach for SFUDA comprising of target-specific adaptation followed
by task-specific adaptation. In target-specific adaptation, we enhance the
pseudo-label generation by minimizing high entropy regions using the proposed
ensemble entropy minimization loss and a selective voting strategy. In
task-specific adaptation, we exploit the enhanced pseudo-labels using a
student-teacher framework to effectively learn segmentation on the target
domain. We evaluate our proposed method on 2D fundus datasets and 3D MRI

Further, UDA methods work under the assumption that the source data is
accessible during the adaptation process. However, in real-world scenarios, the
labelled source data is often restricted due to privacy regulations, data
transmission constraints, or proprietary data concerns. The Source-Free Domain
Adaptation (SFDA) setting aims to alleviate these concerns by adapting a
source-trained model for the target domain without requiring access to the

adaptive object detection. To this end, we propose a novel training strategy
for adapting a source-trained object detector to the target domain without
source data. More precisely, we design a novel contrastive loss to enhance the
target representations by exploiting the objects relations for a given target
domain input. These object instance relations are modelled using an Instance
Relation Graph (IRG) network, which are then used to guide the contrastive
representation learning. In addition, we utilize a student-teacher based
knowledge distillation strategy to avoid overfitting to the noisy pseudo-labels

However, conventional pruning methods have limitations in that: they are

excessive memory and training cost. In this paper, we propose a novel Channel
Exploration methodology, dubbed as CHEX, to rectify these problems. As opposed
to pruning-only strategy, we propose to repeatedly prune and regrow the
channels throughout the training process, which reduces the risk of pruning
important channels prematurely. More exactly: From intra-layer's aspect, we
tackle the channel pruning problem via a well known column subset selection
(CSS) formulation. From inter-layer's aspect, our regrowing stages open a path
for dynamically re-allocating the number of channels across all the layers
under a global channel sparsity constraint. In addition, all the exploration
process is done in a single training from scratch without the need of a
pre-trained large model. Experimental results demonstrate that CHEX can
effectively reduce the FLOPs of diverse CNN architectures on a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection,
instance segmentation, and 3D vision. For example, our compressed ResNet-50

radius. For the subsample of H$\alpha$+[NII] emitting galaxies, we find a very
tight correlation of $P_{\text{jet}}$ with $M_{\bullet}$ ($\rho =
0.91^{+0.06}_{-0.11}$; BF$_{10} > 100$) and, although poorly constrained, a
hint of an anti-correlation for $P_{\text{jet}}$ and $K$ ($\rho =

into two components separated by $\sim$11 kpc with a total extent of 16 $\sim$3

of a velocity gradient (consistent with previous resolved CO(6-5) imaging), the

preventing the gas from fully settling into a disk. The system likely
represents a merger in an advanced stage. Although the dynamical mass is highly
uncertain, we use it to place an upper limit on the CO-to-H$_2$ mass conversion
factor $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ of 1.4. We revisit the SED fitting, finding that
this galaxy lies on the very massive end of the main sequence at z = 3.4. Based
on the low gas fraction, short gas depletion time and evidence for a central
AGN, we propose that SMM J13120 is in a rapid transitional phase between a
merger-driven starburst and an unobscured quasar. The case of SMM J13120
highlights the how mergers may drive important physical changes in galaxies
without pushing them off the main sequence.

results to classical galactic wind solutions and show the importance of our
newly included physical processes toward observations of ions such as O III, O
VI, O VII and O VIII plus the observable soft X-ray spectra. Non-equilibrium
ionization is reflected in over-ionized gas compared to equilibrium solutions,
leading to much enhanced column densities of highly ionized species. The wind
produces excess soft X-ray ($E\gtrsim 100$ eV) radiation that is several orders
of magnitude higher compared to the metagalactic background. This radiation
ionizes the higher ions (such as O VII) somewhat, but affects the lower ions
(such as O III) significantly. We predict that the observable X-ray spectra
should contain the signatures of such non-equilibrium effects, especially in
X-ray lines such as O VII and O VIII. Simple estimates suggest that both the
temperature and density of the winds may be overestimated by factors of a few
to almost 2 orders of magnitude using simple equilibrium models. We conclude
that both the non-equilibrium ionization and the radiation from the wind itself

explore the distribution and the evolution of galaxies in the log SFR-logM*
plane as a function of the stellar mass-weighted bulge-to-total ratio (BTM) and
also for internal galaxy components (bulge/disc) separately. We find evidence
of a clear link between the presence of a bulge and the flattening of the Main
Sequence in the high-mass end. All bulgeless galaxies (BTM<0.2) lie on the
main-sequence, and there is little evidence of a quenching channel without
bulge growth. Galaxies with a significant bulge component (BTM>0.2) are equally
distributed in number between star forming and passive regions. The vast
majority of bulges in the Main Sequence galaxies are quiescent, while star
formation is localized in the disc component. Our current findings underline a
strong correlation between the presence of the bulge and the star formation
state of the galaxy. A bulge, if present, is often quiescent, independently of
the morphology or the star formation activity of the host galaxy. Additionally,
if a galaxy is quiescent, with a large probability, is hosting a bulge.
Conversely, if the galaxy has a disky shape is highly probable to be star
forming.

we promote the parameters of the generating function to collective coordinates,
there is a dominant saddle that controls the effective action of these coherent

discuss how to add open strings to this formulation. These will produce
calculations that rely on correlators of matrix components of unitaries in the
ensemble that is determined by the HCIZ integral to determine anomalous
dimensions. We also discuss how sphere giants arise from Grassman integrals,
how one gets a dominant saddle and how open strings are added in that case. The
fact that there is a dominant saddle helps to understand how a $1/N$ expansion
arises for open strings. We generalize the coherent state idea to study $1/4$

kinematic, age, and metallicity maps, we obtain the stellar orbits, age and
metallicity distributions of each galaxy. We then decompose each galaxy into
multiple orbital-based components, including a dynamically hot inner stellar
halo component which is identified as the relic of past massive mergers. By
comparing to analogues from cosmological galaxy simulations, chiefly TNG50, we
find that the formation of such a hot inner stellar halo requires the merger
with a now-destroyed massive satellite galaxy of $3.7_{-1.5}^{+2.7} \times
10^{10}$ Msun (about $1/5$ of its current stellar mass) in the case of NGC 1380

merger in NGC 1380 happened $\sim10$ Gyr ago based on the stellar age
distribution of the re-grown dynamically cold disk, whereas the merger in NGC
1427 ended $t\lesssim 8$ Gyr ago based on the stellar populations in its hot
inner stellar halo. The major merger event in NGC 1380 is the first one with
both merger mass and merger time quantitatively inferred in a galaxy beyond the

quasar, which has an estimated supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass of
$6.3\times 10^{9} M_\odot$. In the high X-ray state, it showed a typical level
of X-ray emission relative to its UV/optical emission. Then its 0.5-2 keV
(rest-frame 1.8-7.3 keV) flux dropped by a factor of $\approx7.6$ within two
rest-frame days. The dimming is associated with spectral hardening, as the 2-7
keV (rest-frame 7.3-25.4 keV) flux dropped by only $17\%$ and the effective
power-law photon index of the X-ray spectrum changed from $\approx2.3$ to
$\approx0.9$. The quasar has an infrared (IR)-to-UV spectral energy
distribution and a rest-frame UV spectrum similar to those of typical quasars,
and it does not show any significant long-term variability in the IR and
UV/optical bands. Such an extremely fast and large-amplitude X-ray variability
event has not been reported before in luminous quasars with such massive SMBHs.
The X-ray dimming is best explained by a fast-moving absorber crossing the line
of sight and fully covering the X-ray emitting corona. Adopting a
conservatively small size of $5 {G} M_{\rm BH}/c^2$ for the X-ray corona, the
transverse velocity of the absorber is estimated to be $\approx 0.9c$. The
quasar is likely accreting with a high or even super-Eddington accretion rate,
and the high-velocity X-ray absorber is probably related to a powerful
accretion-disk wind. Such an energetic wind may eventually evolve into a
massive galactic-scale outflow, providing efficient feedback to the host
galaxy.

sample of local Seyfert 2 galaxies to assess if, and to what extent, the
presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can affect the Interstellar Medium
(ISM) properties in a sample of 33 local Seyfert 2 galaxies. We compare the
molecular gas content (MH2), derived from new and archival low-J CO line
measurements of a sample of AGN and a control sample of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs). Both the AGN and the control sample are characterised in terms of
host-galaxy properties (e.g., stellar and dust masses, Mstar and Mdust,
respectively; and star formation rate, SFR). We also investigate the effect of
AGN activity onto the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
molecules in the mid-infrared (MIR), a waveband where the dust-reprocessed
emission from the obscured AGN contributes the most. The AGN hosted in less
massive galaxies (i.e., log(Mstar/Msun)<10.5; log(Mdust/Msun)<7.5) show larger
molecular gas content with respect to SFGs matched in stellar and dust mass.
When comparing their depletion time(tdep~MH2/SFR), AGN show tdep~0.3-1.0 Gyr,
similar to those observed in the control sample of SFGs. Seyfert 2 galaxies
show fainter PAH luminosity at increasingly larger dominance of the nuclear
activity in the MIR. We find no clear evidence for a systematic reduction of
the molecular gas reservoir at galactic scale in Seyfert galaxies with respect
to SFGs. This is in agreement with recent studies showing that molecular gas
content only is reduced in regions of sub-kpc size, where the emission from the
accreting supermassive black hole dominates. Nonetheless, we show that the
impact of AGN activity on the ISM is clearly visible as suppression of the PAH
luminosity.

machine learning algorithms. Here we present the TESS Triple-9 (TT9) catalog --
a uniformly-vetted catalog containing dispositions for 999 exoplanet candidates

produced using the Discovery And Vetting of Exoplanets pipeline, DAVE, and
utilizing the power of citizen science as part of the Planet Patrol project.
More than 70% of the TOIs listed in the TT9 pass our diagnostic tests, and are
thus marked as true planetary candidates. We flagged 144 candidates as false
positives, and identified 146 as potential false positives. At the time of
writing, the TT9 catalog contains ~20% of the entire ExoFOP-TESS TOIs list,
demonstrates the synergy between automated tools and citizen science, and

physiological activity along with different physiological, behavioral and
cognitive changes. One behavioral change is facial expression, which has been
studied extensively over the past few decades. Facial behavior varies with a
person's emotion according to differences in terms of culture, personality,
age, context, and environment. In recent years, physiological activities have
been used to study emotional responses. A typical signal is the
electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures brain activity. Most of existing
EEG-based emotion analysis has overlooked the role of facial expression
changes. There exits little research on the relationship between facial
behavior and brain signals due to the lack of dataset measuring both EEG and
facial action signals simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose to
develop a new database by collecting facial expressions, action units, and EEGs
simultaneously. We recorded the EEGs and face videos of both posed facial
actions and spontaneous expressions from 29 participants with different ages,
genders, ethnic backgrounds. Differing from existing approaches, we designed a
protocol to capture the EEG signals by evoking participants' individual action
units explicitly. We also investigated the relation between the EEG signals and
facial action units. As a baseline, the database has been evaluated through the
experiments on both posed and spontaneous emotion recognition with images
alone, EEG alone, and EEG fused with images, respectively. The database will be
released to the research community to advance the state of the art for
automatic emotion recognition.

guides the network toward challenging points than easier points, which improves

(NN) based autonomous landing system. In such a system, a NN controller
processes images from a camera to guide the aircraft while approaching the
runway. A central challenge for the safety and liveness verification of
vision-based closed-loop systems is the lack of mathematical models that
captures the relation between the system states (e.g., position of the
aircraft) and the images processed by the vision-based NN controller. Another
challenge is the limited abilities of state-of-the-art NN model checkers. Such
model checkers can reason only about simple input-output robustness properties
of neural networks. This limitation creates a gap between the NN model checker
abilities and the need to verify a closed-loop system while considering the
aircraft dynamics, the perception components, and the NN controller. To this
end, this paper presents NNLander-VeriF, a framework to verify vision-based NN
controllers used for autonomous landing. NNLander-VeriF addresses the
challenges above by exploiting geometric models of perspective cameras to
obtain a mathematical model that captures the relation between the aircraft
states and the inputs to the NN controller. By converting this model into a NN
(with manually assigned weights) and composing it with the NN controller, one
can capture the relation between aircraft states and control actions using one
augmented NN. Such an augmented NN model leads to a natural encoding of the
closed-loop verification into several NN robustness queries, which
state-of-the-art NN model checkers can handle. Finally, we evaluate our
framework to formally verify the properties of a trained NN and we show its
efficiency.

often uniformly and randomly samples or prioritizes data sampling based on

effectively described by a time-independent Hamiltonian, referred to as the

$\beta$-functions is defined on the gauge field gradient flow in respective
finite or infinite physical volumes at zero lattice spacing. Recently published
results in the ten-flavor theory led to indicators of an infrared fixed point
(IRFP) in the finite-volume step $\beta$-function in the strong coupling regime
of the theory arXiv:2004.00754. We analyze our substantially extended set of
ten-flavor lattice ensembles at strong renormalized gauge couplings and find no
evidence or hint for IRFP in the finite-volume step $\beta$-function within
controlled lattice reach. We also discuss new ten-flavor tests of the recently
introduced lattice definition and algorithmic implementation of the
$\beta$-function defined on the gradient flow of the gauge field over infinite
Euclidean space-time in the continuum. Originally we introduced this new
algorithm to match finite-volume step $\beta$-functions in massless
near-conformal gauge theories with the infinite-volume $\beta$-function reached
in the chiral limit from small fermion mass deformations of spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking.
  Results from the lattice analysis of the ten-flavor infinite-volume
$\beta$-function are consistent with the absence of IRFP from our step
$\beta$-function based analysis. We make important contact at weak coupling in
infinite volume with gradient flow based three-loop perturbation theory,
serving as a first pilot study toward the long-term goal of developing
alternate approach to the determination of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ at
the Z-boson pole in QCD.

draws from weighted distributions possibly having intractable normalizing
constants. The method may be of interest as a useful tool in situations which
require drawing from an unfamiliar distribution. However, the original
algorithm can have difficulty producing draws in some situations. The present
work restricts attention to a univariate setting where the weight function and
base distribution of the weighted target density meet certain criteria. Here, a
variant of the direct sampler is proposed which uses a step function to
approximate the density of a particular augmented random variable on which the
method is based. Knots for the step function can be placed strategically to
ensure the approximation is close to the underlying density. Variates may then
be generated reliably while largely avoiding the need for manual tuning or
rejections. A rejection sampler based on the step function allows exact draws
to be generated from the target with lower rejection probability in exchange
for increased computation. Several applications of the proposed sampler
illustrate the method: generating draws from the Conway-Maxwell Poisson
distribution, a Gibbs sampler which draws the dependence parameter in a random
effects model with conditional autoregression structure, and a Gibbs sampler
which draws the degrees-of-freedom parameter in a regression with t-distributed
errors.

recommender systems, active learning, revenue management and other areas. We
consider infinite-horizon discounted restless bandits with many arms where a
fixed proportion of arms may be pulled in each period and where arms share a
finite state space. Although an average-case-optimal policy can be computed via
stochastic dynamic programming, the computation required grows exponentially
with the number of arms $N$. Thus, it is important to find scalable policies
that can be computed efficiently for large $N$ and that are near optimal in
this regime, in the sense that the optimality gap (i.e. the loss of expected
performance against an optimal policy) per arm vanishes for large $N$. However,
the most popular approach, the Whittle index, requires a hard-to-verify
indexability condition to be well-defined and another hard-to-verify condition
to guarantee a $o(N)$ optimality gap. We present a method resolving these
difficulties. By replacing a global Lagrange multiplier used by the Whittle
index with a sequence of Lagrangian multipliers, one per time period up to a
finite truncation point, we derive a class of policies, called fluid-balance
policies, that have a $O(\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap. Unlike the Whittle index,
fluid-balance policies do not require indexability to be well-defined and their
$O(\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap bound holds universally without sufficient
conditions. We also demonstrate empirically that fluid-balance policies provide

simulating the traversal over randomly generated terrains using a physics

  High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel Subjected to Heat Treatment","11 pages, 8 Figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The High Nitrogen Martensitic Stainless Steel (HNMS) was subjected to three
different austenitizing cycles of 1050$^\circ$C, 1075$^\circ$C and
1100$^\circ$C followed by subzero treatment at -70$^\circ$C. The fraction of
retained austenite has been reduced after sub-zero treatment as revealed by
microstructural evolution. The material was subsequently tempered at different
temperatures ranging from 180$^\circ$C to 650$^\circ$C and the change in
micro-structure, hardness, tensile strength and toughness were investigated
after each heat treatment cycle. Optical microscopy, electron microscopy with
EDS and X-Ray diffraction techniques were used to characterize the material.
This has showed the constituents of microstructure were lath martensite,
precipitated metal carbides of type $M_{23}C_6$, $M_7C_6$ and carbo-nitrides.
Hardness, tensile testing and Charpy impact testing were carried to evaluate
mechanical properties after the heat treatment which has showed the better
mechanical properties for the samples solutionised at 1075$^\circ$C. Secondary
hardening has been observed on tempering above 450$^\circ$C which can be
attributed to the precipitation of secondary phase inter-metallic compounds.
Hardness attains a peak value at peculiar temperature range after which it
decreases on further tempering which is most likely because of the loss of
coherency of the precipitates with the metal matrix. This has been further
confirmed by the XRD of the specimens before and after tempering. The study
stablishes the structure-property correlation of HNMS for different heat
treatment cycles. The results indicate that a good combination of hardness and
strength can be achieved after solutionizing at 1075$^\circ$C followed by
double tempering at 525$^\circ$C.

concept of displacement amplification. Our design features two high coefficient
of thermal expansion (CTE) metallic layers separated by a low-CTE dielectric
layer; conductive and dielectric layers are then separated by a thin air gap
and glued together at a few locations. As the temperature increases, the
high-CTE layer tends to expand more than the low-CTE one. Owing to the
constraint to planar expansion imposed by the low-CTE layer, this results in
large out-of-plane displacements of the high-CTE layer -- hence the
displacement amplification term. In our case, the high-CTE layer buckles and
causes a reduction of the gap between conductive and dielectric layers; in
turn, this results in a large change of capacitance. First, we illustrate the
concept via numerical simulations. Then, we realize a low-cost prototype of
such sensor by using aluminum foil as conductor, paper as dielectric, and by
gluing the layers together with cyanoacrylate. Our results demonstrate the
potential of this simple design as a route towards efficient and low-cost
temperature sensors.

tracks phonons generated at various time steps and thus allows multiple
high-frequency wave packets to travel between the atomistic and continuum

is trained using a dataset comprised of B-mode ultrasound images of unburned

B-mode images of burned in situ skin samples obtained from freshly euthanized

show that the model can identify deep-partial thickness burns, which is the
most difficult to diagnose clinically, with 99% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, and
100% specificity. The diagnostic accuracy of the classifier is further
illustrated by the high area under the curve values of 0.99 and 0.95,
respectively, for the receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall
curves. A post hoc explanation indicates that the classifier activates the
discriminative textural features in the B-mode images for burn classification.

Our main contribution is a generative-model-based regularization approach,
robust to out-of-distribution data, which exploits the prior knowledge embedded
in existing data and model pairs. Utilizing an amortized variational inference
objective, a conditional normalizing flow (NF) is pretrained on pairs of low-

seismic image in an inversion scheme involving physics-guided data misfit and a
Gaussian prior on the NF latent variable. Solving this optimization problem
with respect to the latent variable enables us to leverage the benefits of
data-driven conditional priors whilst being informed by physics and data. The

traditional algorithms, thanks to the ability of neural networks to learn
complex patterns. However, in two-class classification tasks like anomaly or
fraud detection, unsupervised methods could do even better, because their
prediction is not limited to previously learned types of anomalies. An
intuitive approach of anomaly detection can be based on the distances from the
centers of mass of the two respective classes. Autoencoders, although trained
without supervision, can also detect anomalies: considering the center of mass
of the normal points, reconstructions have now radii, with largest radii most
likely indicating anomalous points. Of course, radii-based classification were
already possible without interposing an autoencoder. In any space, radial
classification can be operated, to some extent. In order to outperform it, we
proceed to radial deformations of data (i.e. centric compression or expansions
of axes) and autoencoder training. Any autoencoder that makes use of a data
center is here baptized a centric autoencoder (cAE). A special type is the cAE
trained with a uniformly compressed dataset, named the centripetal autoencoder
(cpAE). The new concept is studied here in relation with a schematic artificial
dataset, and the derived methods show consistent score improvements. But tested
on real banking data, our radial deformation supervised algorithms alone still
perform better that cAEs, as expected from most supervised methods;
nonetheless, in hybrid approaches, cAEs can be combined with a radial
deformation of space, improving its classification score. We expect that
centric autoencoders will become irreplaceable objects in anomaly live
detection based on geometry, thanks to their ability to stem naturally on
geometrical algorithms and to their native capability of detecting unknown
anomaly types.

Additionally, the doubly resonant pump and second-harmonic fields allow for
cascaded third-harmonic generation, where a secondary optically written

identification of the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome in
observational data, which relies on two sets of variables: observed covariates
to be controlled for and a suspected instrument. Under a causal structure
commonly found in empirical applications, the testable conditional independence
of the suspected instrument and the outcome given the treatment and the
covariates has two implications. First, the instrument is valid, i.e. it does
not directly affect the outcome (other than through the treatment) and is
unconfounded conditional on the covariates. Second, the treatment is
unconfounded conditional on the covariates such that the treatment effect is
identified. We suggest tests of this conditional independence based on machine
learning methods that account for covariates in a data-driven way and
investigate their asymptotic behavior and finite sample performance in a
simulation study. We also apply our testing approach to evaluating the impact
of fertility on female labor supply when using the sibling sex ratio of the

used for enforcing safety related set-theoretic properties, such as forward
invariance and reachability, of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we
extend this rich framework to nonlinear discrete-time systems subject to
stochastic uncertainty and propose a framework for assuring risk-sensitive
safety in terms of coherent risk measures. To this end, we introduce risk
control barrier functions (RCBFs), which are compositions of barrier functions
and dynamic, coherent risk measures. We show that the existence of such barrier
functions implies invariance in a coherent risk sense. Furthermore, we
formulate conditions based on finite-time RCBFs to guarantee finite-time
reachability to a desired set in the coherent risk. Conditions for
risk-sensitive safety and finite-time reachability of sets composed of Boolean
compositions of multiple RCBF are also formulated. We show the efficacy of the
proposed method through its application to a cart-pole system in a
safety-critical scenario.

efficiently generate energetic charge carriers, also known as hot electrons,
owing to their ability to squeeze and enhance electromagnetic fields in
confined subwavelength spaces. However, it is very challenging to accurately
identify and quantify the dynamics of hot carriers, mainly due to their
ultrafast time decay. Their non-equilibrium temperature response is one of the
key factors missing to understand the short time decay and overall transient
tunable absorption performance of gap-plasmon metasurfaces. Here, we
systematically study the temperature dynamics of hot electrons and their
transition into thermal carriers at various timescales from femto to
nanoseconds by using the two-temperature model. Additionally, the hot electron
temperature and generation rate threshold values are investigated by using a
hydrodynamic nonlocal model approach that is more accurate when ultrathin gaps
are considered. The derived temperature dependent material properties are used
to study the ultrafast transient nonlinear modification in the absorption
spectrum before plasmon-induced lattice heating is established leading to
efficient tunable nanophotonic absorber designs. We also examine the damage
threshold of these plasmonic absorbers under various pulsed laser
illuminations, an important quantity to derive the ultimate input intensity
limits that can be used in various emerging nonlinear optics and other tunable

counter-rotating vortex pair bears a striking resemblance to speaker-wires and
their interaction with each other is a precursor to further destabilization and
breakdown of the flow field into smaller structures. On its own, a speaker-wire
vortex retains its unique topology without any vortex reconnection or breakup.
For a fixed slope angle $\alpha=3^{\circ}$ and at a constant Prandtl number, we
analyse the saturated state of speaker-wire vortices and perform a bi-global
linear stability analysis based on their stationary state. We establish the
existence of both fundamental and subharmonic secondary instabilities depending
on the circulation and transverse wavelength of the base state of speaker-wire
vortices. The dominance of subharmonic modes relative to the fundamental mode
helps explain the relative stability of a single vortex pair compared to the
vortex dynamics in presence of two or an even number of pairs.These instability
modes are essential for the bending and merging of multiple speaker-wire
vortices, which break up and lead to more dynamically unstable states,
eventually paving the way for transition towards turbulence. This process is
demonstrated via direct numerical simulations with which we are able to track
the nonlinear temporal evolution of these instabilities.

research disciplines. The semisolid hydrated OM resists transport through the
mud pore space and the water that is bound to the OM is not free pore water.
Calculations of marine mud mass-physical properties without consideration and

least squares (GMLS) with adaptive $h$-refinement. In Stokes limit, solid
kinematics can be dominated by the singularities governing the lubrication
effects. Resolving those singularities with adaptive $h$-refinement can lead to
an ill-conditioned linear system of equations. For constructing the
interpolation and restriction operators - the key ingredients of the multigrid
preconditioner, we utilize the geometric information of hierarchical sets of
GMLS nodes generated in adaptive $h$-refinement. We build decoupled smoothers
through physics-based splitting and then combine them via a multiplicative
overlapping Schwarz approach. Through numerical examples with the inclusion of
different numbers and shapes of solid bodies, we demonstrate the performance
and assess the scalability of the designed preconditioner. As the total degrees
of freedom and the number of solid bodies $N_s$ increase, the proposed
monolithic geometric multigrid preconditioner can ensure convergence and good
scalability when using the Krylov iterative method for solving the linear
systems of equations generated from the spatially adaptive GMLS discretization.
More specifically, for a fixed number of solid bodies, as the discretization
resolution is incrementally refined, the number of iterations of the linear
solver can be maintained at the same level, indicating nearly linear
scalability of our preconditioner with respect to the total degrees of freedom.
When $N_s$ increases, the number of iterations is nearly proportional to
$\sqrt{N_s}$, implying the sublinear optimality with respect to the number of

analog front-end (AFE) of the pixel, and was used to measure the time
resolution as a function of signal charge, independently of the TDC. It was
shown that for the default configuration, the AFE time resolution in the
hole-collecting mode is limited to 105 ps. However, this can be improved up to
about 60 ps by increasing the preamplifier bias-current at the cost of
increased power dissipation. For the electron-collecting mode, an AFE time
resolution of 47 ps was measured for a bare Timepix4 device at a signal charge
of 21 ke. It was observed that additional input capacitance from a bonded
sensor reduces this figure to 62 ps.

be forced to learn generalizable knowledge about the role of each circuit

would then be helpful for few-shot generalization to unseen circuit metrics
that require more time consuming simulations for obtaining the ground-truth

we describe each circuit as a graph and use graph neural networks (GNNs) to
learn node embeddings. We show that pretraining GNNs on prediction of output
node voltages can encourage learning representations that can be adapted to new
unseen topologies or prediction of new circuit level properties with up to 10x
more sample efficiency compared to a randomly initialized model. We further
show that we can improve sample efficiency of prior SoTA model-based

implicit feedback control strategies which are implemented by populations to
modulate the spread of contagion. While this task of capturing endogenous
behavior can be achieved through intricate modeling assumptions, we find that a
population's reaction to case counts can be described through a second order
affine dynamical system with linear control which fits well to the data across
different regions and times throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The model fits
the data well both in and out of sample across the 50 states of the United
States, with comparable $R^2$ scores to state of the art ensemble predictions.
In contrast to recent models of epidemics, rather than assuming that
individuals directly control the contact rate which governs the spread of
disease, we assume that individuals control the rate at which they vary their
number of interactions, i.e. they control the derivative of the contact rate.
We propose an implicit feedback law for this control input and verify that it
correlates with policies taken throughout the pandemic. A key takeaway of the
dynamical model is that the ""stable"" point of case counts is non-zero, i.e.
COVID-19 will not be eradicated under the current collection of policies and
strategies, and additional policies are needed to fully eradicate it quickly.
Hence, we suggest alternative implicit policies which focus on making
interventions (such as vaccinations and mobility restrictions) a function of
cumulative case counts, for which our results suggest a better possibility of
eradicating COVID-19.

synthesis. Images are synthesized by rendering the volumes from a given camera.
These models can disentangle the 3D scene from the camera viewpoint in any

formation, such as geometry and appearance. In this paper, we design a 3D GAN
which can learn a disentangled model of objects, just from monocular
observations. Our model can disentangle the geometry and appearance variations
in the scene, i.e., we can independently sample from the geometry and
appearance spaces of the generative model. This is achieved using a novel
non-rigid deformable scene formulation. A 3D volume which represents an object
instance is computed as a non-rigidly deformed canonical 3D volume. Our method
learns the canonical volume, as well as its deformations, jointly during
training. This formulation also helps us improve the disentanglement between
the 3D scene and the camera viewpoints using a novel pose regularization loss
defined on the 3D deformation field. In addition, we further model the inverse
deformations, enabling the computation of dense correspondences between images

enabling scientific and technological breakthroughs in diverse fields including
cavity QED, optical clocks, precision length metrology and spectroscopy. Though
resonator designs vary widely, all high-end applications benefit from mirrors
with the lowest loss and highest finesse possible. Fabrication of the highest
finesse mirrors relies on centuries-old mechanical polishing techniques, which
offer losses at the part-per-million (ppm) level. However, no existing
fabrication techniques are able to produce high finesse resonators with the
large range of mirror geometries needed for scalable quantum devices and
next-generation compact atomic clocks. In this paper, we introduce a new and
scalable approach to fabricate mirrors with ultrahigh finesse ($\geq 10^{6}$)
and user-defined radius of curvature spanning four orders of magnitude
($10^{-4}-10^{0}$ m). We employ photoresist reflow and reactive ion etching to
shape and transfer mirror templates onto a substrate while maintaining
sub-Angstrom roughness. This substrate is coated with a dielectric stack and
used to create arrays of compact Fabry-P\'erot resonators with finesse values
as high as 1.3 million and measured excess loss $<$ 1 ppm. Optical ringdown
measurements of 43 devices across 5 substrates reveal that the fabricated
cavity mirrors -- with both small and large radii of curvature -- produce an
average coating-limited finesse of 1.05 million. This versatile new approach
opens the door to scalable fabrication of high-finesse miniaturized
Fabry-P\'erot cavities needed for emerging quantum optics and frequency
metrology technologies.

have only been developed within general relativity, while models to test
theory-agnostic deviations from general relativity have been purely based on
the signal's dominant mode. We here extend the parameterized post-Einsteinian
framework to include the $\ell=2, 3$ and $4$ higher harmonics to first
post-Newtonian order, therefore providing a ready-to-use Fourier-domain
waveform model for tests of general relativity with higher harmonics. We find
that the deformations to the higher harmonics of the Fourier phase can be
easily mapped to the deformation of the dominant harmonic, while the
deformations to the higher-harmonics of the Fourier amplitude in general cannot

deformations of the waveform amplitude (through a re-scaling deformation of the

surface roughness, which relies on measuring vibratory signals using the

reference design and fabrication procedure of a miniature and low-cost tactile

serves as a mechanoreceptor for converting mechanical information to digital

field data through the Hall effect and creating high-dimensional time-frequency
domain features for material texture classification. Additionally, we
investigate the effects of different superficial sensor fingerprint patterns
for classifying materials through both simulation and physical experimentation.
After extracting time series and frequency domain features, we assess a
k-nearest neighbors classifier for distinguishing between different materials.
The results from our experiments show that our biomimetic tactile sensors with
fingerprint ridges can classify materials with more than 8% higher accuracy and
lower variability than ridge-less sensors. These results, along with the low

adaptively decreases the learning rate by detecting convergence of the

the user to balance desired accuracy against computational cost by comparing

smaller learning were used and (ii) the predicted computation required to
converge with the smaller learning rate. We validate the robustness and

obtained a lossless 4-bit Conformer model with 5.8x size reduction compared to
the float32 model. Following this, we for the first time investigated and
revealed the viability of 4-bit quantization on a practical ASR system that is
trained with large-scale datasets, and produced a lossless Conformer ASR model

year, the publication rate of biomedical literature has been increasing.
Consequently, there has been considerable effort to harness and summarize the
massive amount of biomedical research articles. While transformer-based
encoder-decoder models in a vanilla source document-to-summary setting have
been extensively studied for abstractive summarization in different domains,
their major limitations continue to be entity hallucination (a phenomenon where
generated summaries constitute entities not related to or present in source
article(s)) and factual inconsistency. This problem is exacerbated in a
biomedical setting where named entities and their semantics (which can be
captured through a knowledge base) constitute the essence of an article. The
use of named entities and facts mined from background knowledge bases
pertaining to the named entities to guide abstractive summarization has not
been studied in biomedical article summarization literature. In this paper, we
propose an entity-driven fact-aware framework for training end-to-end

significantly better performance than the standard source document-to-summary

  Nature of Optically Dull Active Galactic Nuclei",,,"10.1093/pasj/psac029",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  X-ray emission detection in a galaxy is one of the efficient tools for
selecting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). However, many X-ray-selected AGNs are
not easily selected as AGNs by their optical emission. These galaxies,
so-called optically dull (OD) AGNs, are fascinating since their X-ray emission
is bright even though the AGN signature in the optical regime is absent. In a
deep multiwavelength survey over 2 deg$^2$ of the Cosmic Evolution Survey
(COSMOS) field, we have looked for the OD AGNs using photometric,
spectroscopic, and X-ray data. We identified 310 non-broad line sources with
optical spectra as AGN using X-ray selection up to redshift $z\sim 1.5$. We
inspected the spectra to check for any AGN signature in their optical emission
lines: [Ne V] forbidden emission line, Mass Excitation diagram (MEx), color
excitation diagram (TBT), and excess in [O II ] emission line. Finally, we
found 48 AGNs show AGN signatures in the optical spectrum classified as
narrow-line AGN and 180 AGNs that did not show any AGN signature as OD AGN
sample. The simple explanation of OD AGN's nature is due to a bright host
galaxy that dilutes the AGN light or dust materials obscuring the AGN light.
The bright host galaxy dilution explains nearly $70\%$ of our OD AGN sample. At
the same time, the dust material obscuration is unlikely for the main reason.
By estimating the Eddington ratio, we also found that 95/180 of our OD AGNs
have a lower accretion rate of $(\lambda_\text{Edd})\lesssim 10^{-2}$ than the
typical AGN value. We expected the lower accretion rate sources that suffer
from neither host galaxy dilution nor obscuration to have Radiatively
Inefficient Flow (RIAF) in their accretion disk. Finally, nine sources have
been identified to be most likely host the RIAF disk.

paper, we devise a protocol that enables the creation of efficient light

execution time. Our construction is based on a bisection game that traverses

specific constructions within the meta-language can be related via bisimulation
(implying path equivalence) to the type systems they correspond. This allows
our approach to provide a convenient means of deriving synthetic denotational

pure type systems (PTS), and probabilistic dependent type systems (PDTS). We
discuss further the relationship of PTS to non-well-founded set theory, and

proportional hazards. However, it does not hold when, for example, there is a
delayed onset of the treatment effect. In such a situation, an acute change in
the hazard ratio function is expected to exist. This paper considers the Cox
model with change-points and derives AIC-type information criteria for
detecting those change-points. The change-point model does not allow for
conventional statistical asymptotics due to its irregularity, thus a formal AIC
that penalizes twice the number of parameters would not be analytically
derived, and using it would clearly give overfitting analysis results.
Therefore, we will construct specific asymptotics using the partial likelihood
estimation method in the Cox model with change-points. Based on the original
derivation method for AIC, we propose information criteria that are
mathematically guaranteed. If the partial likelihood is used in the estimation,
information criteria with penalties much larger than twice the number of
parameters could be obtained in an explicit form. Numerical experiments confirm
that the proposed criterion is clearly superior in terms of the original
purpose of AIC, which is to provide an estimate that is close to the true
structure. We also apply the proposed criterion to actual clinical trial data
to indicate that it will easily lead to different results from the formal AIC.

for the FTM task by regularizing its loss function via knowledge distillation
from an ASR-based (LatticeRNN) model. This improves the model decisions,
resulting in 66% gain in accuracy, as measured by equal-error-rate (EER), over

it is possible to define collision avoidance constraints suitable for nonlinear

(2+L)MN additional constraints and LMN additional variables, with L being the

slower and less reliable solving time. In this paper, we overcome this issue by
building closed-form representations of the collision avoidance conditions by
outer-approximating the Minkowski sum conditions for collision. Our solution
requires only MN constraints (and no additional variables), leading to a
smaller nonlinear program. On motion planning problems for an autonomous car

GPU memory resource. Therefore, the optimization of GPU memory resources is
highly demanded. Swapping and recomputation are commonly applied to make better
use of GPU memory in deep learning. However, as an emerging domain, several
challenges remain:1)The efficiency of recomputation is limited for both static
and dynamic methods. 2)Swapping requires offloading parameters manually, which
incurs a great time cost. 3) There is no such dynamic and fine-grained method
that involves tensor swapping together with tensor recomputation nowadays. To
remedy the above issues, we propose a novel scheduler manager named
DELTA(Dynamic tEnsor offLoad and recompuTAtion). To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to make a reasonable dynamic runtime scheduler on the
combination of tensor swapping and tensor recomputation without user oversight.
In DELTA, we propose a filter algorithm to select the optimal tensors to be
released out of GPU memory and present a director algorithm to select a proper
action for each of these tensors. Furthermore, prefetching and overlapping are
deliberately considered to overcome the time cost caused by swapping and
recomputing tensors. Experimental results show that DELTA not only saves
40%-70% of GPU memory, surpassing the state-of-the-art method to a great extent
but also gets comparable convergence results as the baseline with acceptable
time delay. Also, DELTA gains 2.04$\times$ maximum batchsize when training
ResNet-50 and 2.25$\times$ when training ResNet-101 compared with the baseline.
Besides, comparisons between the swapping cost and recomputation cost in our
experiments demonstrate the importance of making a reasonable dynamic scheduler
on tensor swapping and tensor recomputation, which refutes the arguments in
some related work that swapping should be the first and best choice.

cloud data centers. As these machines are shared between multiple users, it
becomes increasingly important to protect applications against potential
attacks. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of Nvidia's DGX multi-GPU
machines to covert and side channel attacks. These machines consist of a number
of discrete GPUs that are interconnected through a combination of custom
interconnect (NVLink) and PCIe connections. We reverse engineer the cache
hierarchy and show that it is possible for an attacker on one GPU to cause
contention on the L2 cache of another GPU. We use this observation to first
develop a covert channel attack across two GPUs, achieving the best bandwidth
of 3.95 MB/s. We also develop a prime and probe attack on a remote GPU allowing
an attacker to recover the cache hit and miss behavior of another workload.
This basic capability can be used in any number of side channel attacks: we
demonstrate a proof of concept attack that fingerprints the application running
on the remote GPU, with high accuracy. Our work establishes for the first time
the vulnerability of these machines to microarchitectural attacks, and we hope
that it guides future research to improve their security.

gradient $|\nabla \rho/\rho|^\alpha$ as the weight, and use the angular

analysis shows that the gradient based weighting scheme is statistically more

which is better and under what circumstances, as the community often relies on
some general beliefs that inform the decision in an ad-hoc manner. To bridge
this gap, in this paper, we empirically compared the widely used encoding
schemes for software performance learning, namely label, scaled label, and
one-hot encoding. The study covers five systems, seven models, and three
encoding schemes, leading to 105 cases of investigation.
  Our key findings reveal that: (1) conducting trial-and-error to find the best
encoding scheme in a case by case manner can be rather expensive, requiring up
to 400+ hours on some models and systems; (2) the one-hot encoding often leads
to the most accurate results while the scaled label encoding is generally weak
on accuracy over different models; (3) conversely, the scaled label encoding
tends to result in the fastest training time across the models/systems while
the one-hot encoding is the slowest; (4) for all models studied, label and
scaled label encoding often lead to relatively less biased outcomes between
accuracy and training time, but the paired model varies according to the
system.

we present the top-level design of the first portable CT-MRI system and
evaluate its imaging performance via realistic numerical simulations. In this
CT-MRI system, the magnet made of two NdFeB rings of about 40.0 cm radius forms
a magnetic field of about 57 mT at the isocenter and has a gap of 11.3 cm to
accommodate the rotating CT gantry. The targeted MR imaging field of view (FOV)
is a sphere of ~15 cm in diameter and that of CT is approximately 20 cm
diameter in axial direction and 5 cm in longitudinal direction. Our results
show a great potential of such a hybrid system. The proposed CT-MRI system will
be valuable in applications such as imaging in underdeveloped countries,
disaster scenes and battle fields.

which is important both from a theoretical and a practical point of view. Yet,
in general, it is difficult to give good estimates of fidelity, especially when
one works with mixed states over Hilbert spaces of very high dimension.
Although, there has been some progress on fidelity estimation, all prior work
either requires a large number of identical copies of the relevant states, or
relies on unproven heuristics. In this work, we improve on both of these

lower bound that depends polynomially on the dimension. Moreover, if circuit
descriptions for the relevant states are provided, we show that the task is

settings for this learning problem depending on (i) what additional information
we have about $f$ (known as a model class assumption), (ii) how we measure the

mathematical description of the optimal performance possible (the smallest
possible error of recovery) is known in the presence of a model class

that a near optimal $\hat f$ can be found by solving a certain discrete
over-parameterized optimization problem with a penalty term. Here, near optimal
means that the error is bounded by a fixed constant times the optimal error.
This explains the advantage of over-parameterization which is commonly used in
modern machine learning. The main results of this paper prove that
over-parameterized learning with an appropriate loss function gives a near

create severe security problems in video verification. Current black-box
attacks need a large number of queries to succeed, resulting in high
computational overhead in the process of attack. On the other hand, attacks
with restricted perturbations are ineffective against defenses such as
denoising or adversarial training. In this paper, we focus on unrestricted
perturbations and propose StyleFool, a black-box video adversarial attack via
style transfer to fool the video classification system. StyleFool first
utilizes color theme proximity to select the best style image, which helps
avoid unnatural details in the stylized videos. Meanwhile, the target class
confidence is additionally considered in targeted attacks to influence the
output distribution of the classifier by moving the stylized video closer to or
even across the decision boundary. A gradient-free method is then employed to
further optimize the adversarial perturbations. We carry out extensive
experiments to evaluate StyleFool on two standard datasets, UCF-101 and
HMDB-51. The experimental results demonstrate that StyleFool outperforms the
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in terms of both the number of queries and
the robustness against existing defenses. Moreover, 50% of the stylized videos
in untargeted attacks do not need any query since they can already fool the
video classification model. Furthermore, we evaluate the indistinguishability
through a user study to show that the adversarial samples of StyleFool look
imperceptible to human eyes, despite unrestricted perturbations.

Universal sampling algorithms (e.g., Farthest Point Sampling) work without

nature are agnostic about the downstream task/model. As such, they have no
implicit knowledge about which points would be best to keep and which to
reject. Recent work has shown how task-specific point cloud sampling (e.g.,
SampleNet) can be used to outperform traditional sampling approaches by
learning which points are more informative. However, these learnable samplers
face two inherent issues: i) overfitting to a model rather than a task, and
\ii) requiring training of the sampling network from scratch, in addition to
the task network, somewhat countering the original objective of down-sampling
to increase efficiency. In this work, we propose an almost-universal sampler,
in our quest for a sampler that can learn to preserve the most useful points
for a particular task, yet be inexpensive to adapt to different tasks, models,
or datasets. We first demonstrate how training over multiple models for the
same task (e.g., shape reconstruction) significantly outperforms the vanilla
SampleNet in terms of accuracy by not overfitting the sample network to a
particular task network. Second, we show how we can train an almost-universal
meta-sampler across multiple tasks. This meta-sampler can then be rapidly
fine-tuned when applied to different datasets, networks, or even different
tasks, thus amortizing the initial cost of training.

of potential failures could prevent the catastrophic plant downtime and
economic loss. In this paper, we divide the operational states of a rotating
machine into normal, risky, and high-risk ones based on the time to the moment
of failure. Then a cascade classifying algorithm is proposed to predict the

abnormal condition; for time periods which are predicted as abnormal we further
classify them into risky or high-risk states. Moreover, traditional

facilitate fast read and write operation. We present a heterostructure
comprising a two-dimensional (2D) magnet and a 2D topological insulator (TI) as
a viable option for designing fast memory devices. We theoretically model
spin-charge dynamics between the 2D magnets and 2D TIs. Using the adiabatic
approximation, we combine the non-equilibrium Green's function method for
spin-dependent electron transport, and time-quantified Monte-Carlo for
simulating magnetization dynamics. We show that it is possible to switch the
magnetic domain of a ferromagnet using spin-torque from spin-polarized edge
states of 2D TI. We further show that the switching between TIs and 2D magnets
is strongly dependent on the interface exchange ($J_{\mathrm{int}}$), and an
optimal interface exchange depending on the exchange interaction within the
magnet is required for efficient switching. Finally, we compare the
experimentally grown Cr-compounds and show that Cr-compounds with higher
anisotropy (such as $\rm CrI_3$) results in lower switching speed but more
stable magnetic order.

large amount of high-quality training data. In reality, EDA developers have
very limited access to the latest design data, which is owned by design

well-studied ML applications in EDA. Our approach allows an ML model to be
collaboratively trained with data from multiple clients but without explicit
access to the data for respecting their data privacy. To further strengthen the
results, we co-design a customized ML model FLNet and its personalization under
the decentralized training scenario. Experiments on a comprehensive dataset

linearly coupled system. We leverage this modelization to embrace the influence
of heterogeneous higher-order coupling, including promoting and inhibiting

coupled overdamped bistable oscillators and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons.
Particularly, we numerically and analytically reveal that the optimal signal

competition between dispersion and aggregation induced by heterogeneous
higher-order and positive pairwise couplings, respectively. Our results
contribute to a better understanding of the signal propagation in linearly

sedimentary magnetite deposits. We hypothesize that UV (200-300nm) irradiation
of magnetite deposits could generate hydrated spin-polarized electrons
sufficient to induce chirally selective prebiotic chemistry. Such electrons are
potent reducing agents that drive reduction reactions where the spin
polarization direction can alter enantioselectively the reaction kinetics. Our
estimate of this chiral bias is based on the strong effective spin-orbit
coupling observed in the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, as
applied to energy differences in reduction reactions for different isomers. In
the original CISS experiments, spin selective electron transmission through a
monolayer of dsDNA molecules is observed at room temperature - indicating a
strong coupling between molecular chirality and electron spin. We propose that
the chiral symmetry breaking due to the CISS effect, when applied to reduction
chemistry, can induce enantioselective synthesis on the prebiotic Earth and
thus facilitate the homochiral assembly of life's building blocks.

time-periodic perturbation, the Lagrange point is replaced by a periodic orbit,
equivalently viewed as a hyperbolic-elliptic fixed point of a symplectic map

identified in the discrete map about the fixed point, in analogy with the
geometric construction of Conley and McGehee about the index-1 saddle

time-varying), the linearized map locally conserves a time-independent

the image, and then generates a feature map with only irrelevant objects and
background by the model. Finally, some regions in the background feature map
are used to replace some regions of the target object in the original image
feature map. In this way, ReplaceBlock can effectively simulate the feature map
of the occluded image. The experimental results show that ReplaceBlock works
better than DropBlock in regularizing convolutional networks.

evaluating metrics derived from the confusion matrix to try to uncover the
mechanism with which Deep Neural Networks understand art. To achieve so,
VGG-11, pre-trained on ImageNet and discriminatively fine-tuned, was used on
handcrafted small-data datasets designed from real-world photography gallery

factors such as shape and color, rather than Non-Exhibited Properties or

the determinant when art pieces have very similar Exhibited Properties. We also
showed that a single-task and single-modality model's understanding of art is
inadequate as it largely ignores Non-Exhibited Properties.

attention for its promise to train segmentation models only with image-level

incurs the performance bottleneck of WSSS. This paper provides analytical and
empirical evidence that the actual bottleneck may not be sparse coverage but a
global thresholding scheme applied after CAM. Then, we show that this issue can
be mitigated by satisfying two conditions; 1) reducing the imbalance in the
foreground activation and 2) increasing the gap between the foreground and the
background activation. Based on these findings, we propose a novel activation
manipulation network with a per-pixel classification loss and a label
conditioning module. Per-pixel classification naturally induces two-level
activation in activation maps, which can penalize the most discriminative
parts, promote the less discriminative parts, and deactivate the background
regions. Label conditioning imposes that the output label of pseudo-masks
should be any of true image-level labels; it penalizes the wrong activation
assigned to non-target classes. Based on extensive analysis and evaluations, we
demonstrate that each component helps produce accurate pseudo-masks, achieving
the robustness against the choice of the global threshold. Finally, our model
achieves state-of-the-art records on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014

real-world systems. As a consequence, the proper setting for empirical modeling
is that of partially-observed systems. Notably, data-driven models consistently
outperform physics-based models for systems with few observable degrees of
freedom; e.g., hydrological systems. Here, we provide an operator-theoretic
explanation for this empirical success. To predict a partially-observed
system's future behavior with physics-based models, the missing degrees of
freedom must be explicitly accounted for using data assimilation and model
parametrization. Data-driven models, in contrast, employ delay-coordinate
embeddings and their evolution under the Koopman operator to implicitly model
the effects of the missing degrees of freedom. We describe in detail the
statistical physics of partial observations underlying data-driven models using
novel Maximum Entropy and Maximum Caliber measures. The resulting
nonequilibrium Wiener projections applied to the Mori-Zwanzig formalism reveal
how data-driven models may converge to the true dynamics of the observable
degrees of freedom. Additionally, this framework shows how data-driven models

on the observation that a good initial guess of the future poses is very
helpful in improving the forecasting accuracy. This motivates us to propose a
novel two-stage prediction framework, including an init-prediction network that
just computes the good guess and then a formal-prediction network that predicts
the target future poses based on the guess. More importantly, we extend this
idea further and design a multi-stage prediction framework where each stage
predicts initial guess for the next stage, which brings more performance gain.
To fulfill the prediction task at each stage, we propose a network comprising
Spatial Dense Graph Convolutional Networks (S-DGCN) and Temporal Dense Graph
Convolutional Networks (T-DGCN). Alternatively executing the two networks helps
extract spatiotemporal features over the global receptive field of the whole
pose sequence. All the above design choices cooperating together make our

speakers is known in advance, hence they are specific to the number of

mixture in which the number of speakers is unknown. This paper formulates the
speech separation with the unknown number of speakers as a multi-pass source
extraction problem and proposes a coarse-to-fine recursive speech separation
method. This method comprises two stages, namely, recursive cue extraction and
target speaker extraction. The recursive cue extraction stage determines how
many computational iterations need to be performed and outputs a coarse cue
speech by monitoring statistics in the mixture. As the number of recursive
iterations increases, the accumulation of distortion eventually comes into the
extracted speech and reminder. Therefore, in the second stage, we use a target
speaker extraction network to extract a fine speech based on the coarse target
cue and the original distortionless mixture. Experiments show that the proposed
method archived state-of-the-art performance on the WSJ0 dataset with a
different number of speakers. Furthermore, it generalizes well to an unseen
large number of speakers.

typically reticent to share internal information about their competitive
advantages. This work takes a different approach by combining large-scale
statistical techniques with publicly available blockchain data in order to
answer previously intractable questions. The crux of our analysis technique is
based on the simple observation that some miners can utilize their hashpower
more efficiently due to their position in the network. By teasing out that
effect, we de-bias the mining power distribution to get a more accurate
estimate. Using that de-biased mining power distribution, we can answer
questions about the network position of miners in each cryptocurrency network.
Finally, during the course of this study, we observed some unusual mining

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to develop appropriate and reliable
evaluation measures for new applications where conventional measures are not
well suited. Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) is one such application, and the
current practice is to use R@$K,\theta$ for evaluating VMR systems. However,
this measure has two disadvantages. First, it is rank-insensitive: It ignores
the rank positions of successfully localised moments in the top-$K$ ranked list
by treating the list as a set. Second, it binarizes the Intersection over Union
(IoU) of each retrieved video moment using the threshold $\theta$ and thereby
ignoring fine-grained localisation quality of ranked moments.
  We propose an alternative measure for evaluating VMR, called Average Max IoU
(AxIoU), which is free from the above two problems. We show that AxIoU
satisfies two important axioms for VMR evaluation, namely, \textbf{Invariance
against Redundant Moments} and \textbf{Monotonicity with respect to the Best
Moment}, and also that R@$K,\theta$ satisfies the first axiom only. We also
empirically examine how AxIoU agrees with R@$K,\theta$, as well as its
stability with respect to change in the test data and human-annotated temporal
boundaries.

remove blur caused by the motion of the camera and the objects. Recurrent
Neural Networks~(RNNs) are often adopted to model the temporal dependency
between frames via hidden states. When motion blur is strong, however, hidden
states are hard to deliver proper information due to the displacement between
different frames. While there have been attempts to update the hidden states,
it is difficult to handle misaligned features beyond the receptive field of
simple modules. Thus, we propose 2 modules to supplement the RNN architecture
for video deblurring. First, we design Ping-Pong RNN~(PPRNN) that acts on
updating the hidden states by referring to the features from the current and
the previous time steps alternately. PPRNN gathers relevant information from
the both features in an iterative and balanced manner by utilizing its
recurrent architecture. Second, we use a Selective Non-Local Attention~(SNLA)
module to additionally refine the hidden state by aligning it with the
positional information from the input frame feature. The attention score is
scaled by the relevance to the input feature to focus on the necessary
information. By paying attention to hidden states with both modules, which have
strong synergy, our PAHS framework improves the representation powers of RNN
structures and achieves state-of-the-art deblurring performance on standard

iterations. However, the recently introduced artificial neural network (ANN)
method can dramatically reduce the analysis time in the case of repeated
analyses of similar samples. Here, we demonstrate the analysis of XRR data
using a mixture density network (MDN), which enables probabilistic prediction
while maintaining the advantages of an ANN. First, under the assumption of a
unimodal probability distribution of the output parameter, the trained MDN can
estimate the best-fit parameter and, at the same time, estimate the confidence
interval (CI) corresponding to the error bar of the best-fit parameter. The CI
obtained in this manner is similar to that obtained using the Neumann process,
a well-known statistical method. Next, the MDN method provides several possible
solutions for each parameter in the case of a multimodal distribution of the
output parameters. An unsupervised machine learning method is used to cluster
possible parameter sets in order of high probability. Determining the true
value by examining the candidates of the parameter sets obtained in this manner
can help solve the inherent inverse problem associated with scattering data.

80 TPa (30 to 800 million atmospheres), the highest pressure ever achieved,
using radiography of spherically-converging shocks. The shocks were generated
by ablation of a plastic coating by soft x-rays in a laser-heated hohlraum at
the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Experiments were performed with low and
high drive powers, spanning different but overlapping pressure ranges. The
radius-time history of the shock, and the profile of mass density behind, were
determined by profile-matching from a time-resolved x-ray radiograph across the
diameter of the sphere. Above ~50 TPa, the heating induced by the shock was
great enough to ionize a significant fraction of K-shell electrons, reducing
the opacity to the 10.2 keV probe x-rays. The opacity and mass density were
deduced simultaneously using the constraint that the total mass of the sample
was constant. The Hugoniot and opacity were consistent with density functional
theory calculations of the electronic states and equation of state (EOS), and
varied significantly from theoretical Hugoniots based on Thomas-Fermi theory.
Theoretical models used to predict the compressibility of diamond ablator
experiments at the NIF, producing the highest neutron yields so far from
inertial confinement fusion experiments, are qualitatively consistent with our
EOS measurements but appear to overpredict the compressibility slightly. These
measurements help to evaluate theoretical techniques and constrain wide-range

experiments used a non-instantaneous resetting protocol that motivated us to
study in particular the case where $p(x)$ corresponds to the stationary
non-Boltzmann distribution of an RTP in the presence of a harmonic trap. This
distribution $p(x)$ is characterized by a parameter $\nu>0$, which depends on
the microscopic parameters of the RTP dynamics. We show that the first-passage
time distribution of the free RTP, drawn from this initial distribution,
develops interesting singular behaviours, depending on the parameter $\nu$. We
then switch on resetting, mimicked by thermal relaxation of the RTP in the
presence of a harmonic trap. Resetting leads to a finite mean first-passage
time (MFPT) and we study this as a function of the resetting rate for different
values of the parameters $\nu$ and $b = L/c$ where $c$ is the right edge of the
initial distribution $p(x)$. In the diffusive limit of the RTP dynamics, we
find a rich phase diagram in the $(b,\nu)$ plane, with an interesting

similar rich behaviours emerge for the full RTP dynamics.

model to a downstream optimization task that uses its predictions in order to
perform better on that specific task. The main technical challenge associated
with DFL is that it requires being able to differentiate through the
optimization problem, which is difficult due to discontinuous solutions and
other challenges. Past work has largely gotten around this issue by
handcrafting task-specific surrogates to the original optimization problem that
provide informative gradients when differentiated through. However, the need to
handcraft surrogates for each new task limits the usability of DFL. In
addition, there are often no guarantees about the convexity of the resulting
surrogates and, as a result, training a predictive model using them can lead to
inferior local optima. In this paper, we do away with surrogates altogether and
instead learn loss functions that capture task-specific information. To the
best of our knowledge, ours is the first approach that entirely replaces the
optimization component of decision-focused learning with a loss that is
automatically learned. Our approach (a) only requires access to a black-box
oracle that can solve the optimization problem and is thus generalizable, and
(b) can be convex by construction and so can be easily optimized over. We
evaluate our approach on three resource allocation problems from the literature

task structure in all three domains, and even hand-crafted surrogates from the

cosmology, increasingly challenging $\Lambda\mbox{CDM}$ by $H_0$-tension. This
model derives from a finite temperature broken conformal symmetry of radiation,
described by a non-radiative correction with unknown sign in energy density.
This symmetry breaking has a sign ambiguity, in which corrections about the IR
fixed point are normal or tachyonic. While the first has been ruled out in a
recent study, the latter possesses a late-time temperature $T_c\simeq
4\,T_{CMB}$ associated with $\Omega_{\cal U}\simeq 1$ ($\Omega_{\cal U} \simeq
10^4 \Omega_{CMB}$), where $T_{CMB}$ denotes the temperature of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB). Thus exposed to the enormous heat bath of
unparticles, $T_{CMB}$ is constrained by the astronomical age of the Universe
$T_{u,0}$. The relative temperature shift $\Delta T/T$ in any heat exchange to
the CMB is hereby limited to the uncertainty of a few percent in $T_{u,0}$.
This bounds the effective cross-section of unparticles interactions with CMB
photons to $\sigma _{\gamma \mathcal{U}} \lesssim 10^{-40}\ \mbox{m}^2=10^{-3}\
\mbox{nb}$. Assuming a standard cross-section across the broadband mass and
energy spectrum of unparticles, a more stringent bound $\sigma _{\gamma
\mathcal{U}} \lesssim 10^{-3}\,\mbox{pb}$ derives from COBE-FIRAS constraints
on spectral distortions. The first is midway of photon-neutrino
$\sigma_{\gamma\nu}$ and photon-photon cross sections $\sigma_{\gamma\gamma}$,
the second is on par with $\sigma_{\gamma\nu}$. These constraints put late-time
unparticle cosmology, if present, at the edge of the standard model.

for a semi-Dirac Haldane model on a honeycomb lattice in presence of an
extended range (third neighbour) hopping. While in the absence of a third
neighbour hopping, $t_3$, the system exhibits gapless electronic spectrum, its
presence creates an energy gap in the dispersion. However, the nature of the
spectral gap, that is, whether it is trivial or topological needs to be
ascertained. We find that the answer depends on the value of $t_3$, and its
interplay with the value of the onsite potential that breaks the sublattice
symmetry, namely, Semenoff mass ($\Delta$). To elucidate our findings on the
topological phases, we demonstrate two kinds of phase diagrams using the
available parameter space, one in which the phases are shown in the
$\Delta$-$t_3$ plane, and the other one in a more familiar $\Delta$-$\phi$
plane ($\phi$ being the Haldane flux). The phase diagrams depict the presence
of Chern insulating lobes comprising of Chern numbers $\pm2$ and $\pm1$ for
certain values of $t_3$, along with trivial insulating regions (zero Chern
number). Thus there are phase transitions from one topological regime to
another which are characterized by abrupt changes in the values of the Chern
number. To support the existence of the topological phases, we compute the
counter-propagating chiral edge modes in a ribbon geometry. Finally, the
anomalous Hall conductivity shows plateaus either at $e^2/h$ or $2e^2/h$
corresponding to these topological phases.

accessible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This limitation has been
addressed by a host of denoising techniques, recently including so-called
MPPCA: Principal component analysis (PCA) of the signal followed by automated
rank estimation, exploiting the Marchenko-Pastur (MP) distribution of noise
singular values. Operating on matrices comprised by data-patches, this popular
approach objectively identifies noise components and, ideally, allows noise to
be removed without introducing artifacts such as image blurring or non-local
averaging. The MPPCA rank estimation, however, relies on a large number of
noise singular values relative to the number of signal components to avoid such
ill effects. This condition is unlikely to be met when data-patches and
therefore matrices are small, for example due to spatially varying noise. Here,
we introduce tensor MPPCA (tMPPCA) for the purpose of denoising
multidimensional data, for example from multi-contrast acquisitions. Rather
than combining dimensions in matrices, tMPPCA utilizes each dimension of the
multidimensional data's inherent tensor-structure to better characterize noise,
and to recursively estimate signal components. Relative to matrix-based MPPCA,
tMPPCA requires no additional assumptions, and comparing the two in a numerical
phantom and a multi-TE diffusion MRI dataset, tMPPCA dramatically improves
denoising performance. This is particularly true for small data-patches, which
we believe will improve denoising in cases of spatially varying noise.

A simple modification in computing the similarity matrix allows the general

different parts of loss functions asymmetrically while keeping their merits. It
follows the assumptions that the optimal function for anchor-positive pairs may
differ from one for anchor-negative pairs, and a proxy may have a different

between previous and future frames instead of the whole frame, which can
greatly help capture the complex motion information in high-resolution videos.
In addition, the proposed RPM can supervise the spatial encoder and temporal

theory are a very powerful tool for understanding lithium-ion batteries, as

and thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example,
in battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of
powerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric
vehicles) we need to perform very fast calculations using simple devices. For
this reason, simplified models that retain most of the features at a lower
computational cost are widely used. Even though in the literature we often find
these simplified models posed independently, leading to inconsistencies between
models, they can actually be derived from more complicated models using a
unified and systematic framework. In this review, we showcase this reductive
framework, starting from a high-fidelity microscale model and reducing it all
the way down to the Single Particle Model (SPM), deriving in the process other
common models, such as the Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model. We also provide a
critical discussion on the advantages and shortcomings of each of the models,
which can aid model selection for a particular application. Finally, we provide
an overview of possible extensions to the models, with a special focus on

with discontinuous moving caused by out-of-view or occlusion. Existing
long-term tracking methods follow two typical strategies. The first strategy
employs a local tracker to perform smooth tracking and uses another re-detector
to detect the target when the target is lost. While it can exploit the temporal
context like historical appearances and locations of the target, a potential
limitation of such strategy is that the local tracker tends to misidentify a
nearby distractor as the target instead of activating the re-detector when the
real target is out of view. The other long-term tracking strategy tracks the
target in the entire image globally instead of local tracking based on the
previous tracking results. Unfortunately, such global tracking strategy cannot
leverage the temporal context effectively. In this work, we combine the
advantages of both strategies: tracking the target in a global view while
exploiting the temporal context. Specifically, we perform global tracking via
ensemble of local trackers spreading the full image. The smooth moving of the
target can be handled steadily by one local tracker. When the local tracker
accidentally loses the target due to suddenly discontinuous moving, another
local tracker close to the target is then activated and can readily take over
the tracking to locate the target. While the activated local tracker performs
tracking locally by leveraging the temporal context, the ensemble of local
trackers renders our model the global view for tracking. Extensive experiments
on six datasets demonstrate that our method performs favorably against
state-of-the-art algorithms.

users (EUs). Two joint transmit and reflect beamforming optimization problems
are investigated with different practical objectives. The first problem
maximizes the weighted sum-power harvested by the EUs subject to individual
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the IUs, while
the second problem maximizes the weighted sum-rate of the IUs subject to
individual energy harvesting (EH) constraints at the EUs. The optimization
problems are non-convex and difficult to solve optimally. To tackle these two
problems, we first rigorously prove that dedicated energy beams are not
required for their corresponding semidefinite relaxation (SDR) reformulations

precoding design. Then, by capitalizing on the techniques of alternating
optimization (AO), SDR, and successive convex approximation (SCA),
computationally efficient algorithms are developed to obtain suboptimal
solutions of the resulting optimization problems. Simulation results
demonstrate that, given the same total system power budget, significant
performance gains in terms of operating range of wireless power transfer (WPT),

In this paper, we theoretically analyze the affection of the neighbor quality

the concept of neighbor quality for both node classification and recommendation

classification, we propose three propositions to theoretically analyze how the
neighbor quality affects the node classification performance of GCN models.
Second, based on the three proposed propositions, we introduce the graph
refinement process including specially designed neighbor evaluation methods to
increase the neighbor quality so as to boost both the node classification and
recommendation tasks. Third, we conduct extensive node classification and
recommendation experiments on several benchmark datasets. The experimental
results verify that our proposed NEGCN framework can significantly enhance the

Specifically, this work proposes a centralized IRS-enabled design for the
NOMA-BF system to optimize the active beamforming and power allocation
coefficient (PAC) of users at the transmitter in the first stage and passive
beamforming at IRS in the 2nd stage to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of
the network. However, an increment in the number of supportable users with the
NOMA-BF system will lead to NOMA user interference and inter-cluster
interference (ICI). To mitigate the effect of ICI, first zero-forcing
beamforming along with efficient user clustering algorithm is exploited and
then NOMA user interference is tackled efficiently through a proposed iterative
algorithm that computes PAC of NOMA user through simplified closed-form
expression under the required system constraints. In the 2nd stage, the problem
of passive beamforming is solved through a technique based on
difference-of-convex (DC) programming and successive convex approximation

distinguish two emitter systems from single emitters with background, providing
a method to quantify the background signal at implanted sites, which might be

featuring in (Euclidean) Dynamical Triangulations, is central to the random
geometry approach to quantum gravity. In case of the 3-sphere, or any other
manifold of dimension greater than two for that matter, the pursuit is held
back by serious challenges, including the wide open problem of enumerating
triangulations. In an attempt to bypass the toughest challenges we identify a
restricted family of triangulations, of which the enumeration appears less
daunting. In a nutshell, the family consists of triangulated 3-spheres
decorated with a pair of trees, one spanning its tetrahedra and the other its
vertices, with the requirement that after removal of both trees one is left
with a tree-like 2-complex. We prove that these are in bijection with a
combinatorial family of triples of plane trees, satisfying restrictions that
can be succinctly formulated at the level of planar maps. An important
ingredient in the bijection is a step-by-step reconstruction of the
triangulations from triples of trees, that results in a natural subset of the
so-called locally constructible triangulations, for which spherical topology is
guaranteed, through a restriction of the allowed moves. We also provide an
alternative characterization of the family in the framework of discrete Morse
gradients. Finally, several exponential enumerative bounds are deduced from the
triples of trees and some simulation results are presented.

research purposes. Among the utilities, we can mention: a) the possibility to
apply corrections once an image is acquired with a wrong emissivity value and
it is not possible to acquire a new one; b) privacy protection in thermal

suitable for several applications, but hides the identity of a user; c) image

its reinsurer. The problem formulation considered in this paper is closely
connected to the optimal portfolio problem in finance, with some crucial
distinctions. In particular, the insurance company's surplus is here (as is
routinely the case) approximated by a Brownian motion, as opposed to the
geometric Brownian motion used to model assets in finance. Furthermore, risk
exposure is dialled ""down"" via reinsurance, rather than ""up"" via risky
investments. This leads to interesting qualitative differences in the optimal
designs.
  In this paper, using the martingale method, we derive the optimal design as a
function of proportional, non-cheap reinsurance design that maximises the
quadratic utility of the terminal value of the insurance surplus. We also
consider several realistic constraints on the terminal value: a strict lower
boundary, the probability (Value at Risk) constraint, and the expected
shortfall (conditional Value at Risk) constraints under the $\mathbb{P}$ and
$\mathbb{Q}$ measures, respectively. In all cases, the optimal reinsurance
designs boil down to a combination of proportional protection and option-like
protection (stop-loss) of the residual proportion with various deductibles.
Proportions and deductibles are set such that the initial capital is fully
allocated. Comparison of the optimal designs with the optimal portfolios in
finance is particularly interesting. Results are illustrated.

solutions to stochastic fluid-structure interaction with stochastic noise. We
focus on a benchmark problem in stochastic fluid-structure interaction, and
prove the existence of a unique weak solution in the probabilistically strong
sense. The benchmark problem consists of the 2D time-dependent Stokes equations
describing the flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a
linearly elastic membrane modeled by the 1D linear wave equation. The membrane
is stochastically forced by the time-dependent white noise. The fluid and the
structure are linearly coupled. The constructive existence proof is based on a
time-discretization via an operator splitting approach. This introduces a
sequence of approximate solutions, which are random variables. We show the
existence of a subsequence of approximate solutions which converges, almost
surely, to a weak solution in the probabilistically strong sense. The proof is
based on uniform energy estimates in terms of the expectation of the energy
norms, which are the backbone for a weak compactness argument giving rise to a
weakly convergent subsequence of probability measures associated with the
approximate solutions. Probabilistic techniques based on the Skorohod
representation theorem and the Gy\""ongy-Krylov lemma are then employed to
obtain almost sure convergence of a subsequence of the random approximate
solutions to a weak solution in the probabilistically strong sense. The result
shows that the deterministic benchmark FSI model is robust to stochastic noise,
even in the presence of rough white noise in time. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first well-posedness result for fully coupled stochastic
fluid-structure interaction.

  Curriculum Learning -- Extended Version","This paper has been accepted by IEEE ICDE-22",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In step with the digitalization of transportation, we are witnessing a
growing range of path-based smart-city applications, e.g., travel-time
estimation and travel path ranking. A temporal path(TP) that includes temporal
information, e.g., departure time, into the path is fundamental to enable such
applications. In this setting, it is essential to learn generic temporal path
representations(TPRs) that consider spatial and temporal correlations
simultaneously and that can be used in different applications, i.e., downstream
tasks. Existing methods fail to achieve the goal since (i) supervised methods
require large amounts of task-specific labels when training and thus fail to
generalize the obtained TPRs to other tasks; (ii) through unsupervised methods
can learn generic representations, they disregard the temporal aspect, leading
to sub-optimal results. To contend with the limitations of existing solutions,
we propose a Weakly-Supervised Contrastive (WSC) learning model. We first
propose a temporal path encoder that encodes both the spatial and temporal
information of a temporal path into a TPR. To train the encoder, we introduce
weak labels that are easy and inexpensive to obtain and are relevant to
different tasks, e.g., temporal labels indicating peak vs. off-peak hours from
departure times. Based on the weak labels, we construct meaningful positive and
negative temporal path samples by considering both spatial and temporal
information, which facilities training the encoder using contrastive learning
by pulling closer to the positive samples' representations while pushing away
the negative samples' representations. To better guide contrastive learning, we
propose a learning strategy based on Curriculum Learning such that the learning
performs from easy to hard training instances. Experiments studies verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

improved compression ratio. However, modern approaches suffer from long

execution time of deep-learning-based compressors. Building
history-dependencies sequentially (e.g., recurrent neural networks) is
responsible for long inference latency. Instead, we introduce transformer into
deep learning compressors to build history-dependencies in parallel. However,
existing transformer is too heavy in computation and incompatible to
compression tasks.
  This paper proposes a fast general-purpose lossless compressor, TRACE, by
designing a compression-friendly structure based on a single-layer transformer.
We first design a new metric to advise the selection part of compression model
structures. Byte-grouping and Shared-ffn schemes are further proposed to fully
utilize the capacity of the single-layer transformer. These features allow
TRACE to achieve competitive compression ratio and a much faster speed. In
addition, we further accelerate the compression procedure by designing a
controller to reduce the parameter updating overhead. Experiments show that
TRACE achieves an overall $\sim$3x speedup while keeps a comparable compression
ratio to the state-of-the-art compressors. The source code for TRACE and links

In this study, we adopt the Phase Plane Analysis (PPA) technique, a technique

surface plays an important role in the development of the large-scale field
development, especially the polar field reversal, which is a key process in the
Babcock-Leighton-type solar dynamos. The poleward flux transport is nonuniform,
centered around poleward surges as suggested by previous observations. The
strong, long-lasting surges are related to activity complexes, and often result
in violent polar field reversal. However, the nonuniformity of poleward flux
transport has not been evaluated quantitatively. We propose a statistical
method to analyze the poleward flux transport during solar cycles 21-24 by
considering the frequency distributions of the magnetic field at latitudes of
poleward surges occurrence during solar cycles. The nonuniformity is quantified
as the kurtosis statistics representing the tailedness of the distributions. We
test the method on results of surface flux transport simulations, and apply to
WSO, NSO, MWO, and HMI data. We confirm that the poleward surges are of
significance during solar cycles 21-24 in general. The kurtosis within a solar
cycle is affected by different latitudes of the magnetic field and different
data sources. The southern hemisphere of cycle 24 exhibits the largest
kurtosis, agreeing the super surge concept from previous work. The significant
nonuniformity of poleward flux transport originates from the nonrandomness of
active regions, which favors the activity complexes origin of poleward surges.

Second-order PageRank) have become attractive. Due to the complexity of the
second-order random walk models and memory limitations, it is not scalable to
run second-order random walk-based applications on a single machine. Existing
disk-based graph systems are only friendly to the first-order random walk
models and suffer from expensive disk I/Os when executing the second-order
random walks. This paper introduces an I/O-efficient disk-based graph system
for the scalable second-order random walk of large graphs, called GraSorw.
First, to eliminate massive light vertex I/Os, we develop a bi-block execution
engine that converts random I/Os into sequential I/Os by applying a new
triangular bi-block scheduling strategy, the bucket-based walk management, and
the skewed walk storage. Second, to improve the I/O utilization, we design a

vehicles (HEVs) that include an engine start-stop system (SSS). The objective
of the control is to optimally split the energy between the sources of the
powertrain and achieve fuel consumption minimization. In contrast to existing
works, a fuel penalty is used to characterize more realistically SSS engine
restarts, to enable more realistic design and testing of control algorithms.
The paper first derives two important analytic results: a) analytic EM optimal
solutions of fundamental and commonly used series HEV frameworks, and b) proof
of optimality of charge sustaining operation in series HEVs. It then proposes a
novel heuristic control strategy, the hysteresis power threshold strategy
(HPTS), by amalgamating simple and effective control rules extracted from the
suite of derived analytic EM optimal solutions. The decision parameters of the
control strategy are small in number and freely tunable. The overall control
performance can be fully optimized for different HEV parameters and driving
cycles by a systematic tuning process, while also targeting charge sustaining
operation. The performance of HPTS is evaluated and benchmarked against
existing methodologies, including dynamic programming (DP) and a recently
proposed state-of-the-art heuristic strategy. The results show the
effectiveness and robustness of the HPTS and also indicate its potential to be
used as the benchmark strategy for high fidelity HEV models, where DP is no
longer applicable due to computational complexity.

(ILs), which are also low-resource languages (LRLs). We seek to answer one
primary question: is the pool of Indian Language Text Summarization (ILTS)
dataset growing or is there a resource poverty? To an-swer the primary
question, we pose two sub-questions that we seek about ILTS datasets: first,
what characteristics: format and domain do ILTS datasets have? Second, how
different are those characteristics of ILTS datasets from high-resource
languages (HRLs) particularly English. We focus on datasets reported in
published ILTS research works during 2012-2022. The survey of ILTS and English
datasets reveals two similarities and one contrast. The two similarities are:
first, the domain of dataset commonly is news (Hermann et al., 2015). The
second similarity is the format of the dataset which is both extractive and
abstractive. The contrast is in how the research in dataset development has
progressed. ILs face a slow speed of development and public release of datasets
as compared with English. We argue that the relatively lower number of ILTS
datasets is because of two reasons: first, absence of a dedicated forum for
developing TS tools and resources; and second, lack of shareable standard
datasets in the public domain.

by recent progress in cold Rydberg atom experiments, we explore the LY zeros in
classical Rydberg blockade models. We find that the distribution of zeros of
partition functions for these models in one dimension (1d) can be obtained
analytically. We prove that all the LY zeros are real and negative for such
models with arbitrary blockade radii. Therefore, no phase transitions happen in
1d classical Rydberg chains. We investigate how the zeros redistribute as one
interpolates between different blockade radii. We also discuss possible
experimental measurements of these zeros.

versus lines in a projective plane has been known for over 50 years.
Surprisingly, finding the minimum weight of the dual code of projective planes
of non-prime order is still an open problem, even in the Desarguesian case.
  In this paper, we focus on the case of projective planes of order $p^2$,
where $p$ is prime, and we link the existence of small weight code words in the
dual code to the existence of embedded subplanes and {\em antipodal planes}. In
the Desarguesian case, we can exclude such code words by showing a more general
result that no antipodal plane of order at least 3 can be embedded in a
Desarguesian projective plane.
  Furthermore, we use combinatorial arguments to rule out the existence of code
words in the dual code of points and lines of an arbitrary projective plane of
order $p^2$, $p$ prime, of weight at most $2p^2-2p+4$ using more than two
symbols. In particular, this leads to the result that the dual code of the
Desarguesian projective plane $\mathrm{PG}(2,p^2)$, $p\geq 5$, has minimum
weight at least $2p^2-2p+5$.

development and extremely high commercial values. The recent technological leap
of autonomous driving can be primarily attributed to the progress in the
environment perception. Good environment perception provides accurate
high-level environment information which is essential for autonomous vehicles
to make safe and precise driving decisions and strategies. Moreover, such
progress in accurate environment perception would not be possible without deep
learning models and advanced onboard sensors, such as optical sensors (LiDARs
and cameras), radars, GPS. However, the advanced sensors and deep learning
models are prone to recently invented attack methods. For example, LiDARs and
cameras can be compromised by optical attacks, and deep learning models can be
attacked by adversarial examples. The attacks on advanced sensors and deep
learning models can largely impact the accuracy of the environment perception,
posing great threats to the safety and security of autonomous vehicles. In this
thesis, we study the detection methods against the attacks on onboard sensors
and the linkage between attacked deep learning models and driving safety for
autonomous vehicles. To detect the attacks, redundant data sources can be
exploited, since information distortions caused by attacks in victim sensor
data result in inconsistency with the information from other redundant sources.

its wide application in neuromorphic computing. Theoretical understanding into
its switching mechanism has been focused on the processes of conductive
filament generation and rupture, but possible phase transition and
crystallization around the region of conductive filaments (CFs) due to the
variation of O content have been paid less attention to. In this paper,
HfO$\mathrm{_x}$ structural models covering the full stoichiometries from Hf to
HfO$\mathrm{_2}$ were established, and the crystal structure evolution during
the reduction process of hafnia was obtained through first-principles
calculation. The electronic structures and O vacancy migration characteristics
of these structures were analyzed. A criterion was prescribed to predict the
mode of abrupt binary switching or gradual conductance modulation according to
the structure evolution of the CFs. In particular, factors that influence the
merging of tiny conductive channels into strong filaments are intensively
discussed, including the anisotropy of O vacancy migration and the size effect.
The feasibility of Mg doping to achieve robust gradual switching is discussed.

call the oscillation modes for these chiral waves the chiral magnetic mode

dispersion relations of these new modes in the presence of the chirality
flipping due to the finite quark mass and diffusion. We then estimate the
possible frequencies of these modes and amplitudes of the resulting
gravitational waves. In particular, since the CM-mode can exist only in quark
matter with nearly gapless quarks (such as the two-flavor color
superconductivity) for a sufficiently strong magnetic field, corresponding
gravitational waves provide a new possible probe for such quark matter and the
magnetic field in neutron stars.

cosmic-muon data at the CERN Neutrino Platform in 2019-2020 as a prototype of
the DUNE Far Detector. Charged particles propagating through the LArTPC produce
ionization and scintillation light. The scintillation light signal in these
detectors can provide the trigger for non-beam events. In addition, it adds
precise timing capabilities and improves the calorimetry measurements. In
ProtoDUNE-DP, scintillation and electroluminescence light produced by cosmic
muons in the LArTPC is collected by photomultiplier tubes placed up to 7 m away
from the ionizing track. In this paper, the ProtoDUNE-DP photon detection
system performance is evaluated with a particular focus on the different
wavelength shifters, such as PEN and TPB, and the use of Xe-doped LAr,
considering its future use in giant LArTPCs. The scintillation light production

people predominantly experience nature in urban greenspace. Nature exposure is
an important contributor to social, mental and physical health. As the world
faces a pandemic which threatens the physical and mental health of billions of
people, it is crucial to understand that all have the possibility to access
nature exposure to alleviate some of these challenges. Here, for the first
time, we integrate data from Facebook, Twitter, and Google Search users to show
that people looked for greenspace during COVID-19 mobility restrictions but may
not have always managed to reach it. People spent more time in areas with
greenspace when they could and that depended on the level of multiple
deprivation in the neighbourhood where the greenspace was embedded.
Importantly, while people sought greenspace throughout the first 20 months of
the pandemic, this preference intensified through the waves of lockdown. Living
in an affluent area conferred a greenspace advantage in London and Paris but we
find that in Berlin more deprived neighbourhoods sought greenspace more,
including outside their neighbourhood. This highlights the need to understand
how greenspace access and deprivation interact to create more sustainable
communities.

study the electron-phonon dephasing occurring in a GaAs multi-electron
double-quantum-dot system, in a biased case in which the singlet state is
hybridized, as well as in an unbiased case in which the hybridization is
absent. We have found that while the electron-phonon dephasing rate increases
with the number of electrons confined in the unbiased case, this does not hold
in the biased case. We define a merit figure as a ratio between the exchange
energy and the dephasing rate, and have shown that in experimentally relevant
range of the exchange energy, the merit figure actually increases with the
number of electrons in the biased case. Our results show that the
multi-electron quantum-dot system has another advantage in mitigating the
effect of electron-phonon dephasing, which is previously under-appreciated in

free energies are dominated by surface or interface energies. Of particular
interest are the shapes, stability and mechanical stresses of minimal surfaces
spanning specific geometric boundaries. The ""catenoid"" is the best-known
example where an analytical solution is known which describes the form and
stability of a minimal surface held between two parallel, concentric circular
frames. Here we extend this problem to non-axisymmetric, parallel frame shapes
of different orientations, by developing a perturbation approach around the
known catenoid solution. We show that the predictions of the perturbation
theory are in good agreement with experiments on soap films and finite element
simulations (Surface Evolver). Combining theory, experiment and simulation, we
analyse in depth how the shapes, stability and mechanical properties of the
minimal surfaces depend on the type and orientation of elliptical and
three-leaf clover shaped frames. In the limit of perfectly aligned
non-axisymmetric frames, our predictions show excellent agreement with a recent
theory established by Alimov et al (M. M. Alimov, A. V. Bazilevsky and K. G.
Kornev, Physics of Fluids, 2021, 33, 052104). Moreover, we put in evidence the
intriguing capacity of minimal surfaces between non-axisymmetric frames to
transmit a mechanical torque despite being completely liquid. These forces
could be interesting to exploit for mechanical self-assembly of soft matter
systems or as highly sensitive force captors.

prototypes. However, existing explanation techniques often assume that the data
is non-biased and the prediction results can be explained by a set of
prototypical examples. In this work, we develop a unified example-based
explanation method for selecting both representative data (prototypes) and
outliers (criticisms). In particular, we propose a novel application of
adversarial attacks to generate an explanation spectrum of data instances via
an iterative fast gradient sign method. Such unified explanation can avoid
over-generalisation and bias by allowing human experts to assess the model
mistakes case by case. We performed a wide range of quantitative and
qualitative evaluations to show that our approach generates effective and

data by solving a multidimensional Marchenko equation. This procedure requires
a-priori knowledge of the initial focusing function, which can be interpreted
as the inverse of a transmitted wavefield as it would propagate through the
medium, excluding (multiply) reflected waveforms. In practice, the initial
focusing function is often replaced by a time-reversed direct wave, which is
computed with help of a macro velocity model. Green's functions that are
retrieved under this (direct-wave) approximation typically lack
forward-scattered waveforms and their associated multiple reflections. We
examine whether this problem can be mitigated by incorporating transmission
data. Based on these transmission data, we derive an auxiliary equation for the
forward-scattered components of the initial focusing function. We demonstrate
that this equation can be solved in an acoustic medium with mass density
contrast and constant propagation velocity. By solving the auxiliary and
Marchenko equation successively, we can include forward-scattered waveforms in
our Green's function estimates, as we demonstrate with a numerical example.

actions. This design strategy minimizes the engineering and maintenance costs,
but it makes the software verification activities more challenging since safety
properties must be guaranteed for any of the possible configurations. Software
model checking is a popular automated verification technique in many
industries. This verification method explores all possible combinations of the
system model to guarantee its compliance with certain properties or
specification. This is a very appropriate technique for highly configurable
software, since there is usually an enormous amount of combinations to be
checked. This paper presents how PLCverif, a CERN model checking platform, has
been applied to a highly configurable Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
program, the SPS Personnel Protection System (PPS). The benefits and challenges
of this verification approach are also discussed.

satellite image time series (SITS) for crop type mapping is believed to

promising results by stacking spatial and temporal encoders. However, we

by proposing a classification-friendly VAE framework that introduces clustering
mechanisms into latent space and can promote linear separability therein.
Consequently, a few principal axes of the latent space can explain the majority
of variance in raw data. Meanwhile, the VAE framework with proposed tweaks can
maintain competitive classification performance as its purely discriminative
counterpart when only $40\%$ of labelled data is used. We hope the proposed

reduce the study of the problem to the case where the pinning term is replaced

the random parameter in the random case. In order to do that we use a
decoupling of the energy due to Lassoued-Mironescu. This leads us to the study
of the convergence of a scalar positive minimizer of the Ginzburg-Landau energy
with pinning term and with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We prove
uniform convergence of this minimizer towards the mean value of the pinning

  Interaction Problems With a Focus on Fully Enclosed Domains",,,,,"cs.CE cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces are commonly used within
Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools to represent geometric objects. When using
isogeometric analysis (IGA), it is possible to use such NURBS geometries for
numerical analysis directly. Analyzing fluid flows, however, requires complex
three-dimensional geometries to represent flow domains. Defining a
parametrization of such volumetric domains using NURBS can be challenging and
is still an ongoing topic in the IGA community. With the recently developed
NURBS-enhanced finite element method (NEFEM), the favorable geometric
characteristics of NURBS are used within a standard finite element method. This
is achieved by enhancing the elements touching the boundary by using the NURBS
geometry itself. In the current work, a new variation of NEFEM is introduced,
which is suitable for three-dimensional space-time finite element formulations.
The proposed method makes use of a new mapping which results in a non-Cartesian
formulation suitable for fluid-structure interaction (FSI). This is
demonstrated by combining the method with an IGA formulation in a
strongly-coupled partitioned framework for solving FSI problems. The framework
yields a fully spline-based representation of the fluid-structure interface
through a single NURBS. The coupling conditions at the fluid-structure
interface are enforced through a Robin-Neumann type coupling scheme. This
scheme is particularly useful when considering incompressible fluids in fully
Dirichlet-bounded and curved problems, as it satisfies the incompressibility
constraint on the fluid for each step within the coupling procedure. The
accuracy and performance of the introduced spline-based space-time finite
element approach and its use within the proposed coupled FSI framework are
demonstrated using a series of two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems.

Depending on the atmospheric parameters of the target stars, and if
signal-to-noise per pixel of about 400 can be achieved, it should be possible
to detect Be abundances between log(Be/H) = -13.1 and -13.6, with a typical

especially for smaller objects/parts. Compared to state of the art, FLOAT
obtains an absolute improvement of 2.0% for mean IOU (mIOU) and 4.8% for
segmentation quality IOU (sqIOU) on the Pascal-Part-58 dataset. For the larger

profile of these stacked filaments at different redshifts as a function of the
distance perpendicular to the filament axis. A four-parameter universal
functional form, including three comoving scale radii and one amplitude
parameter (core density), provides a good fit out to a radius of 20 cMpc/h for
stacked filaments over a range of redshifts, lengths and masses. The scale
radii are approximately independent of redshift but increase as power-laws with
the comoving filament length. Lastly, we compare the scaling of the filament
mass measured directly from the simulations to the predicted scaling from the
halo-halo-matter three-point correlation function as a function of redshift and
of the mass of the halo pairs. We find that both measured scalings are similar
to, but somewhat shallower than the predictions, by 10% and 30%, respectively.

regularization strategy to boost generalization ability by leveraging learned
sample-level soft targets. Yet, employing a complex pre-trained teacher network

computationally costly. Various self KD methods have been proposed to achieve
higher distillation efficiency. However, they either require extra network
architecture modification or are difficult to parallelize. To cope with these
challenges, we propose an efficient and reliable self-distillation framework,
named Self-Distillation from Last Mini-Batch (DLB). Specifically, we rearrange
the sequential sampling by constraining half of each mini-batch coinciding with
the previous iteration. Meanwhile, the rest half will coincide with the
upcoming iteration. Afterwards, the former half mini-batch distills on-the-fly
soft targets generated in the previous iteration. Our proposed mechanism guides
the training stability and consistency, resulting in robustness to label noise.
Moreover, our method is easy to implement, without taking up extra run-time
memory or requiring model structure modification. Experimental results on three
classification benchmarks illustrate that our approach can consistently
outperform state-of-the-art self-distillation approaches with different network
architectures. Additionally, our method shows strong compatibility with
augmentation strategies by gaining additional performance improvement. The code

when users become too fixated on gamification and get distracted from learning.
This undesirable phenomenon wastes users' precious time and negatively impacts

the first extensive qualitative research on gamification misuse in a popular

navigation algorithms well developed and used commercially in certain
well-defined environments, such as warehouses. The common link in usage
scenarios is that the environments in which the robots are utilized have a high
degree of certainty. Operating environments are often designed to be robot
friendly, for example augmented reality markers are strategically placed and
the ground is typically smooth, level, and clear of debris. For robots to be
useful in a wider range of environments, especially environments that are not
sanitized for their use, robots must be able to handle uncertainty. This
requires a robot to incorporate new sensors and sources of information, and to
be able to use this information to make decisions regarding navigation and the
overall mission. When using autonomous mobile robots in unstructured and poorly
defined environments, such as a natural disaster site or in a rural
environment, ground condition is of critical importance and is a common cause
of failure. Examples include loss of traction due to high levels of ground
water, hidden cavities, or material boundary failures. To evaluate a
non-contact sensing method to mitigate these risks, Frequency Modulated

determine its performance in anticipated ground conditions. The FMCW is then
fixed to a UGV and the sensor system is tested and validated in a

under a stationary process. Yet, at the same time, Hoeffding Trees often
require heuristic and costly extensions to adjust to distributional change,
which may considerably impair their interpretability. In this work, we revisit

electronic structure of van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. One example is the usage
of the moire pattern to create controllable two-dimensional electronic
superlattices through the configurational dependence of interlayer electronic
couplings. This approach has led to some remarkable discoveries in twisted
graphene bilayers, and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homo- and
hetero-bilayers. However, a largely unexplored factor is the interlayer
distance, d, which can impact the interlayer coupling strength exponentially.
In this letter, we quantitatively determine the coupling strengths as a
function of interlayer spacing at various critical points of the Brillouin zone
in bilayer MoS2. The exponential dependence of the coupling parameter on the
gap distance is demonstrated. Most significantly, we achieved a 280%
enhancement of K-valley coupling strength with an 8% reduction of the vdW gap,
pointing to a new strategy in designing a novel electronic system in vdW
bilayers.

simulate spin models, but only for Ising or low-dimensional spins. Currently,
machines implementing arbitrary dimensions remain a challenge. Here, we
introduce and validate a hyperspin machine to simulate multidimensional
continuous spin models. We realize high-dimensional spins by pumping groups of
parametric oscillators, and study NP-hard graphs of hyperspins. The hyperspin
machine can interpolate between different dimensions by tuning the coupling
topology, a strategy that we call ""dimensional annealing"". When interpolating
between the XY and the Ising model, the dimensional annealing impressively
increases the success probability compared to conventional Ising simulators.
Hyperspin machines are a new computational model for combinatorial

large-scale applications in classical and quantum computing, condensed-matter

address this, we propose a protocol where models need to learn online, from

than unity, indicating that the energy dissipation due to the sound attenuation
is mostly governed by the momentum diffusion. It is noticed that the weak

classification. Recently, a series of contrastive representation learning
methods have achieved preeminent success. Particularly, SupCon outperformed the
dominant methods based on cross-entropy loss in representation learning.
However, we notice that there could be potential ethical risks in supervised
contrastive learning. In this paper, we for the first time analyze unfairness
caused by supervised contrastive learning and propose a new Fair Supervised
Contrastive Loss (FSCL) for fair visual representation learning. Inheriting the
philosophy of supervised contrastive learning, it encourages representation of
the same class to be closer to each other than that of different classes, while
ensuring fairness by penalizing the inclusion of sensitive attribute
information in representation. In addition, we introduce a group-wise
normalization to diminish the disparities of intra-group compactness and
inter-class separability between demographic groups that arouse unfair
classification. Through extensive experiments on CelebA and UTK Face, we
validate that the proposed method significantly outperforms SupCon and existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of the trade-off between top-1 accuracy and
fairness. Moreover, our method is robust to the intensity of data bias and
effectively works in incomplete supervised settings. Our code is available at

min-cost flow (MCF) formulation, which is conventionally studied as an instance
of linear program. Given its computationally tractable inference, the success
of MCF tracking largely relies on the learned cost function of underlying
linear program. Most previous studies focus on learning the cost function by
only taking into account two frames during training, therefore the learned cost
function is sub-optimal for MCF where a multi-frame data association must be
considered during inference. In order to address this problem, in this paper we
propose a novel differentiable framework that ties training and inference
together during learning by solving a bi-level optimization problem, where the
lower-level solves a linear program and the upper-level contains a loss
function that incorporates global tracking result. By back-propagating the loss
through differentiable layers via gradient descent, the globally parameterized
cost function is explicitly learned and regularized. With this approach, we are
able to learn a better objective for global MCF tracking. As a result, we
achieve competitive performances compared to the current state-of-the-art
methods on the popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT16, MOT17
and MOT20.

consider both an unsynchronized and a synchronized time division duplexing

without any macro eMBB traffic located inside the factory. The results show
that an unsynchronized deployment is possible if the isolation between the
networks is sufficiently high, either as a result of a separation distance,
wall loss or the use of separate frequencies for the networks. A synchronized
deployment will avoid the cross-link interference, but it will not resolve the
problems related to the closed access and the near-far interference. If the
factory contains eMBB traffic served by the overlaid macro cells, the
performance of both networks will suffer due to a high level of cross-link and
near-far interference. The problems related to the cross-link interference can
be resolved by synchronizing the networks, while the level of the near-far
interference can be reduced by allowing the eMBB users to be connected to base
stations located inside the factory. Finally, if an unsynchronized deployment

key elements of the optimal sizing process, being naturally included in the
definition of the energy cost functions. The effectiveness of the power control
strategy is validated by means of quasi-dynamic simulations on the complete
microgrid model, where sources are defined by the optimal problem solution,
while the cabling (size and length) and the main switchboards location reflect
the expected system layout. Results obtained from the simulation of the

the best tradeoff between accuracy and noise introduction when combining such

is found to be limited by molecular self-diffusion and, hence, related to the
total cuvette volume. In contrast, the repetition rate is limited to a few kHz,
which suggests that thermal effects play a bigger role than triplet population

buildup of a strong negative thermal lens; correcting the non-aberrant part of
this thermal lens by resonator design enables the repetition rate to be pushed

most compounds containing Cr, due to the correlation effect, twofold features
of localization and itinerancy are expected. The localization gives rise to a
magnetic moment, while the latter exhibits as the effective coherent weight for
conductivity. Here we report the physical properties of Cr$_3$Ru compounds with
bcc or A15 phases by using multiple experimental tools. The resistivity
measurements show sharp superconducting transitions at $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.77 K and
$T_{\rm c}$ = 3.37 K for the bcc and A15 structures. A high residual
resistivity exists for both samples with the mean-free-path about 2 nm.
Magnetization measurements also show rather narrow transitions, with a clear
hump structure at high temperatures around 150 K, which may be ascribed to the
remaining antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. The specific heat coefficient
reveals a clear jump at $T_{\rm c}$. We find that s-wave gaps can be adopted to
fit the low temperature specific heat data yielding ratios of about
$2\Delta/k_{\scriptscriptstyle B}T_{\rm c}$ $\approx$ 3.6, indicating a
moderate pairing strength. Interestingly, the Wilson ratios are 3.81 and 3.62

conducting electron in the normal state. Besides, for samples with A15
structure, another specific heat anomaly occurs at about 0.85 K and is
sensitive to magnetic fields. By applying high pressures, both system exhibit
an enhancement of $T_{\rm c}$ with a rate of about 0.019 K/GPa and 0.013 K/GPa
for the bcc and A15 phases. We also conduct tunneling spectrum measurements and
found that the coherence peaks are strongly smeared out. The strong suppression
to the coherence peaks may be ascribed to the strong scattering. Our
combinatory results point to an unconventional superconductivity in these Cr

optically thin emission from small grains ($\lesssim$ 350 ${\rm \mu m}$). We
perform parametric fitting of the ALMA data to characterize the dust disk.
Interestingly, if the dust-to-gas mass ratio is 0.01, the Toomre's Q parameter
reaches $\sim$ 1-3, suggesting that the CW Tau disk might be marginally
gravitationally unstable. The total dust mass is estimated as
$\sim250M_{\oplus}$ for the maximum dust size of 140 ${\rm \mu m}$ that is
inferred from the previous Band 7 polarimetric observation and at least
$80M_{\oplus}$ even for larger grain sizes. This result shows that the CW Tau
disk is quite massive in spite of its smallness. Furthermore, we clearly
identify a gap structure located at $\sim20$ au, which might be induced by a
giant planet. In spite of these interesting characteristics, the CW Tau disk
has normal disk luminosity, size and spectral index at ALMA Band 6, which could
be a clue to the mass budget problem in Class II disks.

the effects of new physics arising from the beyond standard model (BSM). In
this study, we focus on the $e^-p \to j Z\gamma \nu_e \to j (l^{+} l^{-})\gamma
\nu_e$ process to examine the $WWZ\gamma$ anomalous quartic gauge couplings
(aQGC) at the Future Circular Collider-hadron electron (FCC-he) with
center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=5.29$ TeV using with a model-independent way in
the effective theory approach. A Cut-based method are applied to analyse the
signal and relevant SM background. Using with the total cross-sections, we
constrained on the anomalous $ f_ {T,i=0,1,2,5,6,7}/\Lambda^4$ couplings
arising from dimension-8 operators at $95\%$ Confidence Level (C.L.) for the
dilepton decay of the $Z$-boson. The results are composed with integrated
luminosities of ${\cal L}=1,2$ and $3$ $\rm ab^{-1}$ under the systematic
uncertainties of $\%0$, $\%5$ and $\%10$. In the calculations, we use the form
factor to eleminate the effects of the violation of unitarity. With this, we
obtained the limits for the energy scale of the form factor $\Lambda=1$ TeV. In
addition to all this, we use the adventages of $ep$ collisions for analysing
the process with much cleaner environment and lower background effects
comparing with the $pp$ collisions. The obtained sensitivities on $ f_
{T,i=0,1,2,5,6,7}/\Lambda^4$ are comparable with the experimental results and
related phenomenological studies in the literature.

thermal generators), uncertainty grows while there are fewer controllable
units. To reduce operational risks and avoid frequent real-time emergency
controls, a preparatory schedule of renewable generation curtailment is
required. This paper proposes a novel two-stage robust generation dispatch
(RGD) model, where the preparatory curtailment schedule is optimized in the
pre-dispatch stage. The curtailment schedule will then influence the variation
range of real-time renewable power output, resulting in a decision-dependent
uncertainty (DDU) set. In the re-dispatch stage, the controllable units adjust
their outputs within the reserve capacities to maintain power balancing. To
overcome the difficulty in solving the RGD with DDU, an adaptive
column-and-constraint generation (AC\&CG) algorithm is developed. We prove that
the proposed algorithm can generate the optimal solution in finite iterations.
Numerical examples show the advantages of the proposed model and algorithm, and
validate their practicability and scalability.

important tasks in autonomous driving to allow a vehicle to act safely in its
3D environment. The best performing methods in 3D semantic segmentation or
object detection rely on a large amount of annotated data. Yet annotating 3D
Lidar data for these tasks is tedious and costly. In this context, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training method for 3D perception models that is tailored
to autonomous driving data. Specifically, we leverage the availability of
synchronized and calibrated image and Lidar sensors in autonomous driving
setups for distilling self-supervised pre-trained image representations into 3D
models. Hence, our method does not require any point cloud nor image
annotations. The key ingredient of our method is the use of superpixels which
are used to pool 3D point features and 2D pixel features in visually similar
regions. We then train a 3D network on the self-supervised task of matching
these pooled point features with the corresponding pooled image pixel features.
The advantages of contrasting regions obtained by superpixels are that: (1)
grouping together pixels and points of visually coherent regions leads to a
more meaningful contrastive task that produces features well adapted to 3D
semantic segmentation and 3D object detection; (2) all the different regions
have the same weight in the contrastive loss regardless of the number of 3D
points sampled in these regions; (3) it mitigates the noise produced by
incorrect matching of points and pixels due to occlusions between the different
sensors. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate the
ability of our image-to-Lidar distillation strategy to produce 3D
representations that transfer well on semantic segmentation and object
detection tasks.

stochastic lot-sizing problem. The inventory level at each location is reviewed
periodically. Items can be reordered and received from a common central
warehouse and can also be transshipped laterally from the other location.
Lateral transshipment is assumed to be proactive to re-distribute the stock
between two stocking locations. Therefore, the order of action in each period
is: transshipping (if necessary), reordering (if necessary) and satisfying the
demand at each location and each installation. The costs are imposed on
transshipping, ordering, holding, and back-ordering. The key issue in such
systems is to determine the quantity of the lateral transshipment between
depots and the order quantities from the warehouse to both locations. We
formulate the problem via stochastic dynamic programming to minimise the
expected total cost. Since the number of actions increases exponentially as the
feasible quantities of transshipment and replenishment grow, we develop
two-stage dynamic programming to improve the computation efficiency. A
near-optimal policy against this two-stage formulation is introduced based on a
mixed integer linear programming and receding-horizon approach. numerical
experiments are implemented to demonstrate the performance of the two-stage

visual grounding tasks, e.g., phrase localization, referring expression
comprehension (REC) and segmentation (RES). The canonical paradigms for visual
grounding often require substantial expertise in designing network
architectures and loss functions, making them hard to generalize across tasks.
To simplify and unify the modeling, we cast visual grounding as a point
prediction problem conditioned on image and text inputs, where either the
bounding box or binary mask is represented as a sequence of discrete coordinate
tokens. Under this paradigm, visual grounding tasks are unified in our SeqTR
network without task-specific branches or heads, e.g., the convolutional mask
decoder for RES, which greatly reduces the complexity of multi-task modeling.
In addition, SeqTR also shares the same optimization objective for all tasks
with a simple cross-entropy loss, further reducing the complexity of deploying
hand-crafted loss functions. Experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the proposed SeqTR outperforms (or is on par with) the existing
state-of-the-arts, proving that a simple yet universal approach for visual

quality due to removal of dependency on previous target tokens from inputs to

the target dependency within the NAT decoder from two perspectives: decoder
input and decoder self-attention. First, we transform the initial decoder input

attentive transformation process. The transformation reassembles the decoder
input based on target token embeddings and conditions the final output on the
target-side information. Second, before NAT training, we introduce an effective
forward-backward pre-training phase, implemented with different triangle
attention masks. This pre-training phase enables the model to gradually learn
bidirectional dependencies for the final NAT decoding process. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed approaches consistently improve highly

the behaviors of a system satisfy some desired specification. It plays a key
role in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we propose a new
model-based approach for online monitoring for specifications described by
Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Specifically, we assume that the observed
state traces are generated by an underlying dynamic system whose model is
known. The main idea is to consider the dynamic of the system when evaluating
the satisfaction of the STL formulae. To this end, effective approaches for the
computation of feasible sets for STL formulae are provided. We show that, by
explicitly utilizing the model information of the dynamic system, the proposed
online monitoring algorithm can falsify or certify of the specification in
advance compared with existing algorithms, where no model information is used.
We also demonstrate the proposed monitoring algorithm by case studies.

  Tracking","9 pages, 5 figures, under review",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a significant task in achieving autonomous
driving. Traditional works attempt to complete this task, either based on point
clouds (PC) collected by LiDAR, or based on images captured from cameras.
However, relying on one single sensor is not robust enough, because it might
fail during the tracking process. On the other hand, feature fusion from
multiple modalities contributes to the improvement of accuracy. As a result,
new techniques based on different sensors integrating features from multiple
modalities are being developed. Texture information from RGB cameras and 3D
structure information from Lidar have respective advantages under different
circumstances. However, it's not easy to achieve effective feature fusion
because of completely distinct information modalities. Previous fusion methods
usually fuse the top-level features after the backbones extract the features
from different modalities. In this paper, we first introduce PointNet++ to
obtain multi-scale deep representations of point cloud to make it adaptive to
our proposed Interactive Feature Fusion between multi-scale features of images
and point clouds. Specifically, through multi-scale interactive query and
fusion between pixel-level and point-level features, our method, can obtain
more distinguishing features to improve the performance of multiple object
tracking. Besides, we explore the effectiveness of pre-training on each single
modality and fine-tuning on the fusion-based model. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can achieve good performance on the KITTI benchmark
and outperform other approaches without using multi-scale feature fusion.
Moreover, the ablation studies indicates the effectiveness of multi-scale
feature fusion and pre-training on single modality.

use state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations to investigate whether the
Planck high-z sub-mm sources are progenitors of massive clusters at z=0. To
match the PHz sources with simulated halos, we select the most star-forming
halos from z = 3 to z =1.3 in the TNG300 simulation. The total star formation
rate (SFR) of the simulated protocluster candidates is computed from the SFR of
all the galaxies within an aperture corresponding to the Planck beam size,
including those along the line-of-sight. The simulations reproduce the Planck
derived SFRs as the sum of both, the SFR of at least one of the most SF high-z
halo, and the average contribution from SF sources along the line-of-sight.
Focusing on the spectroscopically confirmed PHz protoclusters, we compare the
observed properties of their galaxy members with those in the most SF simulated
halos. We find a good agreement in the stellar mass and SFR distributions, and
in the galaxy number counts, but the SFR-stellar mass relation of the simulated
galaxies tends to be shifted to lower SFRs with respect to the observed one.
Based on the estimated final masses of the simulated halos, we infer that
between 63% and 72% of the Planck selected protoclusters will evolve into
massive galaxy clusters at z=0. Despite contamination from star-forming
galaxies along the line of sight, we confirm the efficiency of Planck to select
star-forming protoclusters at Cosmic Noon with the simulations, and provide a
new criterion for selecting the most massive cluster progenitors at high-z,
using observables like the number of galaxy members and their SFR distribution.

Generally, KPIs are aggregated along multiple dimensions and derived by complex

values are observed, root cause analysis (RCA) can be applied to identify the
reasons for anomalies, so that we can troubleshoot quickly. Recently, several
automatic RCA techniques were proposed to localize the related dimensions (or a
combination of dimensions) to explain the anomalies. However, their analyses
are limited to the data on the abnormal metric and ignore the data of other
metrics which may be also related to the anomalies, leading to imprecise or
even incorrect root causes. To this end, we propose a cross-metric
multi-dimensional root cause analysis method, named CMMD, which consists of two
key components: 1) relationship modeling, which utilizes graph neural network
(GNN) to model the unknown complex calculation among metrics and aggregation
function among dimensions from historical data; 2) root cause localization,
which adopts the genetic algorithm to efficiently and effectively dive into the
raw data and localize the abnormal dimension(s) once the KPI anomalies are
detected. Experiments on synthetic datasets, public datasets and online

parameter spaces constrained by data. All the statistical information obtained
in the output of these analyses is contained in the Markov chains, which one
needs to process and interpret. The marginalization technique allows us to
digest these chains and compute the posterior distributions for the parameter
subsets of interest. In particular, it lets us draw confidence regions in
two-dimensional planes, and get the constraints for the individual parameters.
It is very well known, though, that the marginalized results can suffer from
volume effects, which can introduce a non-negligible bias into our conclusions.
The impact of these effects are barely studied in the literature. In this paper
we first illustrate the problem through a very clear and simple example in two
dimensions, and suggest the use of the profile distributions (PDs) as a
complementary tool to detect marginalization biases directly from the MC
chains. We apply our method to four cosmological models: the standard
$\Lambda$CDM, early dark energy, coupled dark energy and the Brans-Dicke model
with a cosmological constant. We discuss the impact of the volume effects on
each model and the cosmological tensions, using the full Planck 2018
likelihood, the Pantheon compilation of supernovae of Type Ia and data on
baryon acoustic oscillations. Our test is very efficient and can be easily
applied to any MC study. It allows us to estimate the PDs at a derisory
computational cost not only for the main cosmological parameters, but also for
the nuisance and derived ones, and to assess the need to perform a more
in-depth analysis with the exact computation of the PDs.

fluxes that is improved by $40\%$ with respect to previous work, with $4.5\%$
fractional difference for eccentricity $e=0.9$ and black hole dimensionless

between Newtonian, 1PN and 2PN results. Our approach carries over to the
comparable mass case using the resummed EOB equations of motion and paves the
way to faithful EOB-based waveform model for long-inspiral eccentric binaries
for current and future gravitational wave detectors.

Foremost among these challenges is the choice of the most appropriate

comparing eight distance-based partitioning methods for mixed-type data in
terms of cluster recovery performance. A series of simulations carried out by a
full factorial design are presented that examined the effect of a variety of
factors on cluster recovery. The amount of cluster overlap, the percentage of
categorical variables in the data set, the number of clusters and the number of
observations had the largest effects on cluster recovery and in most of the
tested scenarios. KAMILA, K-Prototypes and sequential Factor Analysis and
K-Means clustering typically performed better than other methods. The study can
be a useful reference for practitioners in the choice of the most appropriate

  Learning for Inverter-based Volt-Var Control",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A one-step two-critic deep reinforcement learning (OSTC-DRL) approach for
inverter-based volt-var control (IB-VVC) in active distribution networks is
proposed in this paper. Firstly, considering IB-VVC can be formulated as a
single-period optimization problem, we formulate the IB-VVC as a one-step
Markov decision process rather than the standard Markov decision process, which
simplifies the DRL learning task. Then we design the one-step actor-critic DRL
scheme which is a simplified version of recent DRL algorithms, and it avoids
the issue of Q value overestimation successfully. Furthermore, considering two
objectives of VVC: minimizing power loss and eliminating voltage violation, we
utilize two critics to approximate the rewards of two objectives separately. It
simplifies the approximation tasks of each critic, and avoids the interaction
effect between two objectives in the learning process of critic. The OSTC-DRL
approach integrates the one-step actor-critic DRL scheme and the two-critic
technology. Based on the OSTC-DRL, we design two centralized DRL algorithms.
Further, we extend the OSTC-DRL to multi-agent OSTC-DRL for decentralized
IB-VVC and design two multi-agent DRL algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that
the proposed OSTC-DRL has a faster convergence rate and a better control
performance, and the multi-agent OSTC-DRL works well for decentralized IB-VVC
problems.

Here, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we report the precise

pattern of the electronic structures of covalent compounds upon amorphization
and reduction. Moreover, surface adsorption of the co-catalyst atoms (e.g., Pt)

enables easy accommodation of the co-catalyst atoms, while the extended
electronic states facilitate the separation of photo-induced electrons and

forward in time, we directly predict future object locations and backcast to
determine where each trajectory began. Our approach not only improves overall
accuracy compared to other modular or end-to-end baselines, it also prompts us
to rethink the role of explicit tracking for embodied perception. Additionally,
by linking future and current locations in a many-to-one manner, our approach
is able to reason about multiple futures, a capability that was previously
considered difficult for end-to-end approaches. We conduct extensive
experiments on the popular nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the empirical
effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we investigate the appropriateness
of reusing standard forecasting metrics for an end-to-end setup, and find a
number of limitations which allow us to build simple baselines to game these

this work is to identify from data, the local dynamics around the limit cycle
using linear periodically parameter-varying models. Using a coordinate
transformation onto transversal surfaces, the dynamics are decomposed into two
parts: one along the limit cycle, and one on the transversal surfaces. Then,
the model is identified from trajectory data using kernel-based methods with a
periodic kernel design. The kernel-based model is extended to also account for
variations in system parameters associated with different operating conditions.
The performance of the proposed identification method is demonstrated on a
benchmark nonlinear system and on a simplified airborne wind energy model. The
method provides accurate model parameter estimation, compared to the analytical
linearization, and good prediction capability.

the conventional linear light-cone behavior present in the XXZ model and its
near integrable vicinity. The late-time evolution of the TMI in finite-size
systems is also numerically investigated. The multiple-spin interactions make
the system nearly integrable and weakly suppress the spread of information and
scrambling. The observation of the late-time value of the TMI indicates that
the scrambling nature of the system changes by interactions and this change can
be characterized by a phase-transition-like behavior of the TMI, reflecting the

to out-of-sample subjects. Instead, models must make predictions on test data
that may be drawn from a different distribution, a problem known as

end-to-end framework using a meta-learning approach, which enables the model to
rapidly adapt to a new prediction task with limited training data for
out-of-sample test data. We use three real-world small-scale human subjects
datasets (two randomized control studies and one observational study), for
which we predict treatment outcomes for held-out treatment groups. Our model
learns the latent treatment effects of each intervention and, by design, can
naturally handle multi-task predictions. We show that our model performs the
best holistically for each held-out group and especially when the test group is
distinctly different from the training group. Our model has implications for
improved generalization of small-size human studies to the wider population.

The more localized it is, the more difficult it is to detect and more
deleterious its effects. Often, the progression of localized corrosion is
accompanied by the evolution of porosity in materials, creating internal
void-structures that facilitate the ingress of the external environment into
the interior of the material, further accelerating the internal corrosion.
Previously, the dominant morphology of such void-structures has been reported
to be either three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D). Here, we report a
more localized form of corrosion, which we call 1D wormhole corrosion. Using
electron tomography, we show multiple examples of this 1D and percolating
morphology that manifests a significantly high aspect ratio differentiable from
2D and 3D corrosion. To understand the origin of this mechanism in a Ni-Cr
alloy corroded by molten salt, we combined energy-filtered four-dimensional
scanning transmission electron microscopy (EF-4D-STEM) and ab initio density
functional theory (DFT) calculations to develop a vacancy mapping method with
nanometer-resolution, identifying a remarkably high vacancy concentration in
the diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) zone, up to 100 times the
equilibrium value at the melting point. These vacancy supersaturation regions
act as the precursors of wormholes, and lead to the asymmetrical growth of
voids along GBs. We show that similar 1D penetrating corrosion morphologies
could also occur in other materials or corrosion conditions, implying the broad
impact of this extremely localized corrosion mechanism. Deciphering the origins
of 1D corrosion is an important step towards designing structural materials
with enhanced corrosion resistance, and also offers new pathways to create
ordered-porous materials for functional applications.

Detection (SSOD), namely pseudo labeling and consistency training. We observe
that these two techniques currently neglect some important properties of object

pseudo labeling, existing works only focus on the classification score yet fail
to guarantee the localization precision of pseudo boxes; For consistency
training, the widely adopted random-resize training only considers the
label-level consistency but misses the feature-level one, which also plays an
important role in ensuring the scale invariance. To address the problems
incurred by noisy pseudo boxes, we design Noisy Pseudo box Learning (NPL) that
includes Prediction-guided Label Assignment (PLA) and Positive-proposal
Consistency Voting (PCV). PLA relies on model predictions to assign labels and
makes it robust to even coarse pseudo boxes; while PCV leverages the regression
consistency of positive proposals to reflect the localization quality of pseudo
boxes. Furthermore, in consistency training, we propose Multi-view
Scale-invariant Learning (MSL) that includes mechanisms of both label- and
feature-level consistency, where feature consistency is achieved by aligning
shifted feature pyramids between two images with identical content but varied
scales. On COCO benchmark, our method, termed PSEudo labeling and COnsistency
training (PseCo), outperforms the SOTA (Soft Teacher) by 2.0, 1.8, 2.0 points

improves the learning efficiency for SSOD, e.g., PseCo halves the training time

scene map construction in minimum time steps. The key to this problem lies in
the goal position estimation to enable more efficient robot movements. Previous
approaches either choose the frontier as the goal position via a myopic
solution that hinders the time efficiency, or maximize the long-term value via
reinforcement learning to directly regress the goal position, but does not
guarantee the complete map construction. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm, namely NeuralCoMapping, which takes advantage of both approaches. We
reduce the problem to bipartite graph matching, which establishes the node
correspondences between two graphs, denoting robots and frontiers. We introduce
a multiplex graph neural network (mGNN) that learns the neural distance to fill
the affinity matrix for more effective graph matching. We optimize the mGNN
with a differentiable linear assignment layer by maximizing the long-term
values that favor time efficiency and map completeness via reinforcement
learning. We compare our algorithm with several state-of-the-art multi-robot
active mapping approaches and adapted reinforcement-learning baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and exceptional

used MARCS model atmospheres to compute spectra and the surface brightness of
stars. We first explored the parameter space of MARCS (i.e. effective
temperature, $\log g$, $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$, microturbulence, and mass) in order
to quantify their impact on the surface brightness. Then we considered a
relation between the effective temperature and $\log g$ for late dwarfs and
giants, as well as a solar metallicity, in order to allow a consistent
comparison of theoretical and empirical SBCRs. We find that the SBCR is not
sensitive to the microturbulence and mass. The effect of metallicity on the
SBCR is found to be larger for dwarfs than for giants. It is also larger when
considering larger $V-K_s$ values. We also find that a difference of 0.5 dex in
metallicity between Galactic and LMC SBCRs does not affect the recent LMC
distance determination, based on eclipsing binaries, by more than 0.4%. By
comparing theoretical with empirical SBCRs, we find a good agreement of less
than 2$\sigma$ for F5-K7 dwarfs and giants stars, while a larger discrepancy is
found for M dwarfs and giants (about 4-6$\sigma$). The surface gravity
properties, as modelled in MARCS, explain the differences in the empirical
SBCRs in terms of class. We finally find that theoretical and empirical SBCRs
for Cepheids are consistent. Carefully considering metallicity and $\log g$ is
mandatory when calibrating or using SBCRs.

in which our Universe is described by a 3-brane embedded in a 5d bulk. As a
concrete setup, we consider a bulk scalar field $\phi$ described by a general
Lagrangian $P(X,\phi)$ with $X=-(\partial\phi)^2/2$. By requiring that the
model enforces the 4d curvature of the maximally symmetric 3-brane world-volume
to vanish independently of the 4d effective vacuum energy, only two
possibilities remain: one with a canonical bulk kinetic term and the other with
an unconventional bulk kinetic term similar to a Cuscuton field. Further
demanding the absence of bulk singularity, the latter is selected as a unique
possibility within the class of models. At the background level, the solution
can accommodate any warp factor profile free from bulk singularity and with a
finite effective 4d Planck mass. In a cosmological context, our solution would
describe our (almost) flat Universe at late times, with a bulk warp factor
profile expected to be determined by the evolution of the Universe before
dilution of the matter fields by cosmic expansion. Eventually, a simple
analysis is performed in the bulk showing no obvious instability around the
background solution. A full stability analysis taking into account brane
bending modes is nevertheless necessary and left for future work.

extent to which they contribute to the scatter in the mass-metallicity
relation. We find that rotationally supported disc galaxies have lower
metallicity than dispersion supported spheroidal galaxies at a given mass, in
agreement with previous findings. In EAGLE, this correlation arises because
discs form stars at later times, redshift $z\leqslant 1$, from the accretion of
low-metallicity gas, whereas spheroidal galaxies galaxies typically form stars
earlier, mainly by consumption of their gas reservoir. The different behaviour
reflects the growth of their host dark matter halo: at a given stellar mass,

This new variant is characterized by using a reduced modelling method of the
distributed AC PF problem, which is reformulated as a zero-residual
least-squares problem with consensus constraints. This PF is then solved by a
Gauss-Newton based inexact ALADIN algorithm presented in the paper. An
open-source implementation of this algorithm, called rapidPF+, is provided.

the wind of a late type companion. These are rare objects and so far only a
handful of them are known. One of the most puzzling aspects of the symbiotic
X-ray binaries is the possibility that they contain strongly magnetized neutron
stars. These are expected to be evolutionary much younger compared to their
evolved companions and could thus be formed through the (yet poorly known)
accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf. In this paper, we perform a
broad-band X-ray and soft $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy of two known symbiotic
binaries, Sct X-1 and 4U 1700+24, looking for the presence of cyclotron
scattering features that could confirm the presence of strongly magnetized NSs.
We exploited available Chandra, Swift, and NuSTAR data. We find no evidence of
cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) in the case of Sct X-1 but in
the case of 4U 1700+24 we suggest the presence of a possible CRSF at $\sim$16
keV and its first harmonic at $\sim$31 keV, although we could not exclude
alternative spectral models for the broad-band fit. If confirmed by future
observations, 4U 1700+24 could be the second symbiotic X-ray binary with a
highly magnetized accretor. We also report about our long-term monitoring of
the last discovered symbiotic X-ray binary IGR J17329-2731 performed with

which the adversary can force the device owner to disclose the decryption key.
To combat the coercive attacks, Plausibly Deniable Encryption (PDE) is

  Having observed that none of existing works in the literature have

this gap by experimentally confirming the deniability compromises of the

we have deployed both the hidden volume PDE and the steganographic file system

Traversability is expressed as three independent measures: the ability to
traverse the terrain at a target speed, energy consumption, and acceleration.
The measures are continuous and reflect different objectives for planning that
go beyond binary classification. A deep neural network is trained to predict
the traversability measures from the local heightmap and target speed. To
produce training data, we use an articulated vehicle with wheeled bogie
suspensions and procedurally generated terrains. We evaluate the model on
laser-scanned forest terrains, previously unseen by the model. The model
predicts traversability with an accuracy of 90%. Predictions rely on features
from the high-dimensional terrain data that surpass local roughness and slope
relative to the heading. Correlations show that the three traversability
measures are complementary to each other. With an inference speed 3000 times
faster than the ground truth simulation and trivially parallelizable, the model
is well suited for traversability analysis and optimal path planning over large

power-law indices as well as a single power-law index. Even if the pulsar's
opening angle is treated as a frequency-independent parameter in line with the
usual assumption, the period dependence of this parameter implies relatively
small opening angles and therefore radio luminosities well below the spin-down
power. Although we estimate higher radio luminosities in the physically more
plausible case of a frequency-dependent opening angle, the spin-down power is
again not exceeded by the highest possible radio luminosity. The radio
efficiency of GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 can therefore not be used in favour of
a magnetar hypothesis.

accreted. However, the fastest stars, the hypervelocity stars, are young and
massive and their chemical composition has not yet been analyzed. Though it is
difficult to analyze the chemical composition of a massive young star, we are
well versed in the analysis of late-type stars. We have used high-resolution
ARCES/3.5m Apache Point Observatory, MIKE/Magellan spectra to study the
chemical details of 15 late-type hypervelocity stars candidates. With Gaia EDR3
astrometry and spectroscopically determined radial velocities we found total
velocities with a range of $274$ - $520$ km s$^{-1}$ and mean value of $381$ km
s$^{-1}$. Therefore, our sample stars are not fast enough to be classified as
Hypervelocity stars, and are what is known as extreme-velocity stars. Our
sample has a wide iron abundance range of $-2.5 \le \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \le -0.9$.
Their chemistry indicate that at least 50\% of them are accreted extragalactic
stars, with iron-peak elements consistent with prior sub-Chandrasekhar mass
type Ia supernova enrichment. Without indication of binary companions, their
chemical abundances and orbital parameters are indicative that they are the

be put in a queue of waiting requests. The second model, called the ambulance
reassignment problem, is used when an ambulance finishes its current task to
decide whether the ambulance should be dispatched to a request waiting in

to an ambulance staging location, and if so, which ambulance staging location.
These decisions affect not only the emergency call and ambulance under

of future calls. We propose a rolling horizon approach that combines the
current decisions to be made as first-stage decisions with second-stage models

approximately optimal first-stage decisions. We compare our resulting dispatch

convolutional neural network, which is the dominant network to develop the

Although CapsNet comes with an impressive ability to represent the entities'
hierarchical relationships through a high-dimensional vector embedding, it
fails to capture the long-term temporal correlation of run-to-failure time
series measured from degraded mechanical equipment. On the other hand, the
slow-varying dynamics, which reveals the low-frequency information hidden in
mechanical dynamical behaviour, is overlooked in the existing RUL estimation
models, limiting the utmost ability of advanced networks. To address the
aforementioned concerns, we propose a Slow-varying Dynamics assisted Temporal
CapsNet (SD-TemCapsNet) to simultaneously learn the slow-varying dynamics and
temporal dynamics from measurements for accurate RUL estimation. First, in
light of the sensitivity of fault evolution, slow-varying features are
decomposed from normal raw data to convey the low-frequency components
corresponding to the system dynamics. Next, the long short-term memory (LSTM)
mechanism is introduced into CapsNet to capture the temporal correlation of
time series. To this end, experiments conducted on an aircraft engine and a
milling machine verify that the proposed SD-TemCapsNet outperforms the
mainstream methods. In comparison with CapsNet, the estimation accuracy of the
aircraft engine with four different scenarios has been improved by 10.17%,
24.97%, 3.25%, and 13.03% concerning the index root mean squared error,

evolution of the matter distribution, since clusters form at the highest
density peaks. However, the 3D cluster mass cannot be inferred without
deprojecting the observations, introducing model-dependent biases and
uncertainties due to the mismatch between the assumed and the true cluster
density profile and the neglected matter along the sightline. Since projected
aperture masses can be measured directly in simulations and observationally
through weak lensing, we argue that they are better suited for cluster
cosmology. Using the Mira-Titan suite of gravity-only simulations, we show that
aperture masses correlate strongly with 3D halo masses, albeit with large
intrinsic scatter due to the varying matter distribution along the sightline.
Nonetheless, aperture masses can be measured $\approx 2-3$ times more precisely
from observations, since they do not require assumptions about the density
profile and are only affected by the shape noise in the weak lensing
measurements. We emulate the cosmology dependence of the aperture mass function
directly with a Gaussian process. Comparing the cosmology sensitivity of the
aperture mass function and the 3D halo mass function for a fixed survey solid
angle and redshift interval, we find the aperture mass sensitivity is higher
for $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $w_a$, similar for $\sigma_8$, $n_\mathrm{s}$, and
$w_0$, and slightly lower for $h$. With a carefully calibrated aperture mass
function emulator, cluster cosmology analyses can use cluster aperture masses
directly, reducing the sensitivity to model-dependent mass calibration biases
and uncertainties.

heavier than iron, which are observed in the Solar System, but discrepancies
still persist and important questions concerning the astrophysical site(s) of
the p-process remain unanswered. We investigate how the p-process operates in
exploding rotating massive stars that have experienced an enhanced s-process
nucleosynthesis during their life through rotational mixing. We computed 25
$M_{\odot}$ stellar models at a metallicity of $Z=10^{-3}$ with different
initial rotation velocities and rates for the uncertain
$^{17}$O($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{21}$Ne reaction. The nucleosynthesis calculation,
followed with a network of 737 isotopes, was coupled to stellar evolution, and
the p-process nucleosynthesis was calculated in post-processing during both the
final evolutionary stages and spherical explosions of various energies. In our
models, the p-nuclides are mainly synthesized during the explosion, but not
much during the ultimate hydrostatic burning stages. The p-process yields
mostly depend on the initial number of trans-iron seeds, which in turn depend
on the initial rotation. We found that the impact of rotation on the p-process
is comparable to the impact of rotation on the s-process. From no to fast
rotation, the s-process yields of nuclides with mass number $A<140$ increase by
$3-4$ dex, and so do the p-process yields. Fast rotation with a lower
$^{17}$O($\alpha,\gamma$) rate significantly produces s- and p-nuclides with
$A\geq140$. Our results suggest that the contribution of core-collapse
supernovae from massive stars to the solar (and Galactic) p-nuclei has been
underestimated in the past, and more specifically, that the contribution from
massive stars with sub-solar metallicities may even dominate. A more detailed
study including stellar models with a wide range of masses and metallicities
remains to be performed.

to its environmental coupling. As a paradigmatic platform for this intriguing
phenomenon, we study a central spin that is quasiperiodically driven by two
incommensurate frequencies, and statically coupled to $N-1$ surrounding spins.
In the strong coupling regime, the adiabatic dynamics of the total system is
readily understood to imprint on the central spin an $N$-fold enhanced
topological frequency conversion between the two driving frequencies. We argue
that the topological burning glass effect is induced by the non-unitary
dynamics of the central spin, which locally involves the collective motion of
the surrounding spins. Our results are derived in the framework of adiabatic
perturbation theory and fully corroborated by exact numerical simulations.

senders and receivers, such as co-authoring a scientific article or sending an
email. A number of relational event frameworks have been proposed to address
specific issues raised by modelling time-stamped data with complex temporal and
spatial dependencies. These models attempt to quantify how individuals'
behaviour, external factors and interaction with other individuals change the
network structure over time. It is often of interest to determine whether
changes in the network can be attributed to endogenous mechanisms reflecting
natural relational tendencies, such as reciprocity or triadic effects, with the
latter thought to represent the inherent complexity of human interaction.
  The propensity to form (or receive) ties can also be related to individual
actors' attributes. Nodal heterogeneity in the network is often modelled by
including actor-specific or dyadic covariates, such as age, gender, shared
neighbourhood, etc. However, capturing personality traits such as popularity or
expansiveness is difficult, if not impossible. A failure to account for
unobserved heterogeneity may confound the substantive effect of key variables
of interest. This research shows how node level popularity in terms of sender
and receiver effects may mask ghost triadic effects. These results suggest that
unobserved nodal heterogeneity plays a substantial role in REM estimation
procedure and influences the conclusions drawn from real-world networks.

Simultaneously, a novel double-energy-function analysis method, equipped with

is constructed using the ERA5 dataset as baseline and it consists of 2004
annotated images. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind to be
publicly released. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model to
classify the labeled images. Evaluated on an independent test set, the model
yields an F-1 score of 0.95, indicating that polar lows can be consistently
detected from SAR images. Interpretability techniques applied to the deep
learning model reveal that atmospheric fronts and cyclonic eyes are key
features in the classification. Moreover, experimental results show that the
model is accurate even if: (i) such features are significantly cropped due to
the limited swath width of the SAR, (ii) the features are partly covered by sea
ice and (iii) land is covering significant parts of the images. By evaluating
the model performance on multiple input image resolutions (pixel sizes of 500m,

(WD) and either a low-mass Sun-like star (classical novae) or, a red giant. GeV
gamma-ray emission has been detected from a dozen of classical novae and from
one novae in symbiotic system (V407 Cyg) by Fermi-LAT. For classical novae,
gamma-ray emission is generally thought to be related to internal shocks formed
as fast outflow collides with the slow outflow. However, for V407 Cyg, the
origin of the gamma-ray emission has been debated, as both internal shock and
external shock, resulted from the collision between the nova ejecta and the
ambient wind of the giant companion, were suggested to explain the gamma-ray
data. Recently, bright GeV and TeV gamma-ray emission has been detected from a
nova in symbiotic system, RS Ophiuchi, during its 2021 outburst, which shows a
remarkably smooth power-law decay in time up to about one month after the
outburst. We show that this temporal decay behavior can be interpreted as
arising from an adiabatic external shock expanding in the red giant wind. In
this interpretation, the gamma-rays are produced by shock-accelerated protons
interacting with the dense wind through the hadronic process. We also derive
the scaling relations for the decay slopes for both adiabatic and radiative
nova shocks in the self-similar deceleration phase.

this methodology to design optics, its performance in physical setups is still
limited and affected by manufacturing artifacts of DOE, mismatch between
simulated and resultant experimental point spread functions, and calibration
errors. Additionally, the computational burden of the digital differentiable
model to effectively design the DOE is increasing, thus limiting the size of
the DOE that can be designed. To overcome the above mentioned limitations, the
broadband imaging system with phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) as an
encoded DOE is proposed and developed in this paper. A co-design of the SLM
phase pattern and image reconstruction algorithm is produced following the
end-to-end strategy, using for optimization a convolutional neural network
equipped with quantitative and qualitative loss functions. The optics of the
imaging system is hybrid consisting of SLM as DOE and refractive lens. SLM
phase-pattern is optimized by applying the Hardware-in-the-loop technique,
which helps to eliminate the mismatch between numerical modeling and physical
reality of image formation as light propagation is not numerically modeled but
is physically done. In our experiments, the hybrid optics is implemented by the
optical projection of the SLM phase-pattern on a lens plane for a depth range
0.4-1.9m. Comparison with compound multi-lens optics such as Sony A7 III and

singing voice of a speaker without his or her singing data by learning from
data recorded by others, i.e., the singing teacher. Inspired by the fact that
pitch is the key style factor to distinguish singing from speaking voice, the
proposed Learn2Sing 2.0 first generates the preliminary acoustic feature with
averaged pitch value in the phone level, which allows the training of this
process for different styles, i.e., speaking or singing, share same conditions
except for the speaker information. Then, conditioned on the specific style, a
diffusion decoder, which is accelerated by a fast sampling algorithm during the
inference stage, is adopted to gradually restore the final acoustic feature.
During the training, to avoid the information confusion of the speaker
embedding and the style embedding, mutual information is employed to restrain
the learning of speaker embedding and style embedding. Experiments show that
the proposed approach is capable of synthesizing high-quality singing voice for
the target speaker without singing data with 10 decoding steps.

nondegenerate fibration extends to a global fibration, and we study the
relationship between nondegenerate line fibrations and contact structures in

estimated sensitive attribute information to learn fair models. Experimental
results on real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our framework in terms

representing spherical data as a sequence of triangular patches, extracted from
a subdivided icosphere. A transformer model encodes the sequence of patches via
successive multi-head self-attention layers while preserving the sequence
resolution. We validate the performance of the proposed Surface Vision

Experiments show that the SiT generally outperforms surface CNNs, while
performing comparably on registered and unregistered data. Analysis of

for evaluating medical image segmentation. They have also been criticised, when
reported alone, for their unclear or even misleading clinical interpretation.
DSCs may also differ substantially from HDs, due to boundary smoothness or
multiple regions of interest (ROIs) within a subject. More importantly, either
metric can also have a nonlinear, non-monotonic relationship with outcomes
based on Type 1 and 2 errors, designed for specific clinical decisions that use
the resulting segmentation. Whilst cases causing disagreement between these
metrics are not difficult to postulate. This work first proposes a new
asymmetric detection metric, adapting those used in object detection, for
planning prostate cancer procedures. The lesion-level metrics is then compared
with the voxel-level DSC and HD, whereas a 3D UNet is used for segmenting
lesions from multiparametric MR (mpMR) images. Based on experimental results we
report pairwise agreement and correlation 1) between DSC and HD, and 2) between
voxel-level DSC and recall-controlled precision at lesion-level, with Cohen's
[0.49, 0.61] and Pearson's [0.66, 0.76] (p-values}<0.001) at varying cut-offs.
However, the differences in false-positives and false-negatives, between the
actual errors and the perceived counterparts if DSC is used, can be as high as
152 and 154, respectively, out of the 357 test set lesions. We therefore
carefully conclude that, despite of the significant correlations, voxel-level
metrics such as DSC can misrepresent lesion-level detection accuracy for
evaluating localisation of multifocal prostate cancer and should be interpreted
with caution.

capture local signal patterns in sequence-to-point settings due to the lack of
inductive bias in local context. In this work, we propose an efficient
localness transformer for non-intrusive load monitoring (ELTransformer).
Specifically, we leverage normalization functions and switch the order of
matrix multiplication to approximate self-attention and reduce computational
complexity. Additionally, we introduce localness modeling with sparse local
attention heads and relative position encodings to enhance the model capacity
in extracting short-term local patterns. To the best of our knowledge,
ELTransformer is the first NILM model that addresses computational complexity
and localness modeling in NILM. With extensive experiments and quantitative
analyses, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the the proposed
ELTransformer with considerable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the
practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible
software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical
research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the
experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in
the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or

interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In
this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin

implicitly attract anchors to their corresponding positive sample with various

processes within a computer. The focus is on simulating the mammalian working
memory system. There should be two interacting working memory stores, one
analogous to sustained firing lending the system a focus of attention, and
another analogous to synaptic potentiation lending the system a short-term
memory. These working memory stores retain and coactivate representations,
using them to search long-term memory for appropriate updates. The working
memory stores should be updated continuously, and in an iterative fashion,
meaning that, in the next state, some proportion of the coactive items should
always be retained. Thus, the set of concepts coactive in working memory will
evolve gradually and incrementally over time. This makes each state a revised
iteration of the preceding state and causes successive states to overlap and
blend with respect to the set of representations they contain. As new
representations are added and old ones are subtracted, some remain active for
several seconds over the course of these changes. This persistent activity,
similar to that used in contemporary artificial recurrent neural networks, is
used to spread activation energy throughout the global workspace to search for
the next associative update. The result is a chain of associatively linked
intermediate states that are capable of advancing toward a solution or goal.
Iterative updating is conceptualized here as an information processing
strategy, a computational and neurophysiological determinant of the stream of
thought, and an algorithm for designing and programming artificial general

associated with subsets of key depression symptoms. This paper presents strong
evidence in support of this argument. First, we present a novel large,
cross-sectional, multi-modal dataset collected at Thymia. We then present a set
of machine learning experiments that demonstrate that combining speech with
features from an n-Back working memory assessment improves classifier
performance when predicting the popular eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire
depression scale (PHQ-8). Finally, we present a set of experiments that
highlight the association between different speech and n-Back markers at the
PHQ-8 item level. Specifically, we observe that somatic and psychomotor
symptoms are more strongly associated with n-Back performance scores, whilst
the other items: anhedonia, depressed mood, change in appetite, feelings of
worthlessness and trouble concentrating are more strongly associated with
speech changes.

(ASR) as a metric to evaluate the attack strength but exclusively investigated
it in the white-box setting, while our work extends it to a more practical
black-box setting: transferable attack. It is widely reported that stronger
I-FGSM transfers worse than simple FGSM, leading to a popular belief that
transferability is at odds with the white-box attack strength. Our work
challenges this belief with empirical finding that stronger attack actually
transfers better for the general top-$k$ ASR indicated by the interest class
rank (ICR) after attack. For increasing the attack strength, with an intuitive
interpretation of the logit gradient from the geometric perspective, we
identify that the weakness of the commonly used losses lie in prioritizing the
speed to fool the network instead of maximizing its strength. To this end, we
propose a new normalized CE loss that guides the logit to be updated in the
direction of implicitly maximizing its rank distance from the ground-truth
class. Extensive results in various settings have verified that our proposed
new loss is simple yet effective for top-$k$ attack. Code is available at:

is hybrid, first based on the identification of profiles in a top-down manner,
and then on the refinement of profiles by a personalized data-driven approach.
In this work we report our initial experiment on building such top-down
profiles. We consider the correlations between ethics positions (idealism and
relativism) personality traits (honesty/humility, conscientiousness,
Machiavellianism and narcissism) and worldview (normativism), and then we use a

threatening user privacy as the location-sensitive data needs to be handled by
cloud servers. Although there have been several on-device frameworks for
privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they are still resource-intensive when
it comes to storage and computation, and show limited robustness to the high
sparsity of user-POI interactions. On this basis, we propose a novel
decentralized collaborative learning framework for POI recommendation (DCLR),
which allows users to train their personalized models locally in a
collaborative manner. DCLR significantly reduces the local models' dependence
on the cloud for training, and can be used to expand arbitrary centralized
recommendation models. To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data when
learning each local model, we design two self-supervision signals to pretrain
the POI representations on the server with geographical and categorical
correlations of POIs. To facilitate collaborative learning, we innovatively
propose to incorporate knowledge from either geographically or semantically
similar users into each local model with attentive aggregation and mutual
information maximization. The collaborative learning process makes use of
communications between devices while requiring only minor engagement from the
central server for identifying user groups, and is compatible with common
privacy preservation mechanisms like differential privacy. We evaluate DCLR
with two real-world datasets, where the results show that DCLR outperforms
state-of-the-art on-device frameworks and yields competitive results compared
with centralized counterparts.

theoretical and practical challenges for learning accurate preferences from

networks are widely adopted for its effectiveness and relative simplicity.
Despite being extensively studied, existing attentions still suffer from two
limitations: i) conventional attentions mainly take into account the spatial
correlation between user behaviors, regardless the distance between those
behaviors in the continuous time space; and ii) these attentions mostly provide
a dense and undistinguished distribution over all past behaviors then
attentively encode them into the output latent representations. This is however
not suitable in practical scenarios where a user's future actions are relevant
to a small subset of her/his historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
novel attention network, named self-modulating attention, that models the
complex and non-linearly evolving dynamic user preferences. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on top-N sequential recommendation
tasks, and the results on three large-scale real-world datasets show that our
