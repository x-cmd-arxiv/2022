decades, human-robot collaboration (HRC) remains important to conduct complex
construction tasks. Considering its complexity and uniqueness, it is still
unclear how HRC process will impact construction productivity. To this end, an
agent-based (AB) multi-fidelity modeling approach is introduced to simulate and
evaluate how HRC influences construction productivity. A high-fidelity model is
first proposed for a scenario with one robot. Then, a low-fidelity model is
established to extract key parameters that capture the inner relationship among
scenarios. The multi-fidelity models work together to simulate complex
scenarios. Simulation and experiements show that: 1) the proposed approach is
feasible and flexible for simulation of complex HRC processes, and can cover
multiple collaboration and interaction modes; 2) the influence of the
supplement strategy is simple when there is only one robot, where lower Check
Interval (CI) and higher Supplement Limit (SL) will improve productivity. But
the influence becomes much more complicated when there are more robots due to
the internal competition among robots for the limited time of workers; 3) the
productivity per robot improves when there are more robots and workers, even if
the human-robot ratio remains the same; 4) introducing proactive interaction
between robots and workers could improve productivity significantly, up to 22%
in our experiments, which further depends on the supplement strategy and the
human-robot ratio. Overall, this research contributes an integrated approach to
simulate and evaluate HRC's impacts on productivity as well as valuable
insights on how to optimize HRC for better performance.

for any research and development activities at the start of the twentyfirst
century. Therefore, large research efforts are already based on or will be
targeted on the development of clean fuels to replace fossil fuels, the
improvement of the existing resources and the discovery of new sustainable
energy resources, the establishment of new efficient ways to store sustainable
energy, and the replacement of the existing high energy consuming technologies
with the more energy efficient ones. The latter concept has resulted in
considerable efforts recently to renovate the conventional synthetic chemical
industry by introducing new green chemistry concepts, where the energy
requirements for chemical processing or synthesis would be drastically reduced.
In this context, a vast amount of novel chemical synthesis techniques have been
developed during the last decades. Such innovative techniques include
combustion, sol gel and coprecipitation methods, sonochemistry, hydrothermal
synthesis, and microwave-assisted techniques. Significant qualitative drawbacks
in materials synthesized by such novel ways in terms of crystal quality and
physical properties are usually not encountered. In some cases, even
quantitative improvements, novel crystal arrangements, and interesting particle
shapes can be achieved. The concept of combining several of the recently
developed nonconventional and innovative synthesis techniques is an interesting
concept to even further reduce the energy requirements and particle sizes as
compared to one technique alone. Microwave assisted combustion and sol gel
synthesis are now employed frequently, as well as the combination of
hydrothermal and microwave assisted synthesis, where the latter technique is
the topic of this review.

mel-spectrogram is commonly applied as an intermediate representation, and the
necessity for a mel-spectrogram vocoder is increasing. A mel-spectrogram
vocoder must solve three inverse problems: recovery of the original-scale
magnitude spectrogram, phase reconstruction, and frequency-to-time conversion.
A typical convolutional mel-spectrogram vocoder solves these problems jointly
and implicitly using a convolutional neural network, including temporal
upsampling layers, when directly calculating a raw waveform. Such an approach
allows skipping redundant processes during waveform synthesis (e.g., the direct
reconstruction of high-dimensional original-scale spectrograms). By contrast,
the approach solves all problems in a black box and cannot effectively employ
the time-frequency structures existing in a mel-spectrogram. We thus propose
iSTFTNet, which replaces some output-side layers of the mel-spectrogram vocoder
with the inverse short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) after sufficiently
reducing the frequency dimension using upsampling layers, reducing the
computational cost from black-box modeling and avoiding redundant estimations
of high-dimensional spectrograms. During our experiments, we applied our ideas
to three HiFi-GAN variants and made the models faster and more lightweight with
a reasonable speech quality. Audio samples are available at

Lucas et al. (2019) proposed a method called Aggregated Heavy-Ball (AggHB) that
uses multiple momentum vectors corresponding to different momentum parameters
and averages these vectors to compute the update direction at each iteration.
Lucas et al. (2019) show that AggHB is more stable than the classical
Heavy-Ball method even with large momentum parameters and performs well in
practice. However, the method was analyzed only for quadratic objectives and
for online optimization tasks under uniformly bounded gradients assumption,
which is not satisfied for many practically important problems. In this work,
we address this issue and propose the first analysis of AggHB for smooth
objective functions in non-convex, convex, and strongly convex cases without
additional restrictive assumptions. Our complexity results match the best-known

freedom, the quantum configuration space is rather based on areas as more
fundamental variables. This is also highlighted by the semi-classical limit of
four-dimensional spin foam models, which is described by the Area Regge action.
Despite its central importance to spin foams the dynamics encoded by the Area
Regge action is only poorly understood, in particular in the continuum limit.
We perform here a systematic investigation of the dynamics defined by the Area
Regge action on a regular centrally subdivided hypercubical lattice. This
choice of lattice avoids many problems of the non-subdivided hypercubical
lattice, for which the Area Regge action is singular. The regularity of the
lattice allows to extract the continuum limit and its corrections, order by
order in the lattice constant. We show that, contrary to widespread
expectations which arose from the so-called flatness problem of spin foams, the
continuum limit of the Area Regge action does describe to leading order the
same graviton dynamics as general relativity. The next-to-leading order
correction to the effective action for the length metric is of second order in
the lattice constant, and is given by a quadratic term in the Weyl curvature
tensor. This correction can be understood to originate from an underlying
dynamics of area metrics. This suggests that the continuum limit of spin foam
dynamics does lead to massless gravitons, and that the leading order quantum
corrections can be understood to emerge from a generalization of the

for the observation of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, using a
germanium detector. Given the low recoil energy threshold, these data are
particularly interesting for a low-energy determination of the weak mixing
angle and for the study of new physics leading to spectral distortions at low
momentum transfer. Using two hypotheses for the quenching factor, we study the
impact of the data on: (i) The weak mixing angle at a renormalization scale of
$\sim 10\,\text{MeV}$, (ii) neutrino generalized interactions with light
mediators, (iii) the sterile neutrino dipole portal. The results for the weak
mixing angle show a strong dependence on the quenching factor choice. Although
still with large uncertainties, the Dresden-II data provide for the first time
a determination of $\sin^2\theta_W$ at such scale using coherent elastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering data. Tight upper limits are placed on the light
vector, scalar and tensor mediator scenarios. Kinematic constraints implied by
the reactor anti-neutrino flux and the ionization energy threshold allow the
sterile neutrino dipole portal to produce up-scattering events with sterile
neutrino masses up to $\sim 8\,$MeV. In this context, we find that limits are
also sensitive to the quenching factor choice, but in both cases competitive
with those derived from XENON1T data and more stringent that those derived with
COHERENT data, in the same sterile neutrino mass range.

follows: the high-frequency waves ({\nu}>5 mHz) in the photosphere, in both
cases, before and after the flare, are generated at the foot-points of the
chromospheric loop, while in the chromosphere (H{\alpha} line), before the
event the power enhancement exhibits for maximum of flare emission, and after
the eruption the enhancement by all frequencies is observed only in the post

area before the flare has a random character, while after the flare
oscillation's power is concentrated in the pore, and weakened outside of. We
conclude that the accurate detection of high-frequency acoustic waves in the

behavior of the gluon plasma produced in the early stages of a heavy-ion

functions of quarks and gluons in QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT) exhibit
self-similar ""scaling"" evolution with time-dependent scaling exponents long
before those exponents reach their pre-hydrodynamic fixed-point values. In this
work we shed light on the origin of this time-dependent scaling phenomenon in
the small-angle approximation to the Boltzmann equation. We first solve the
Boltzmann equation numerically and find that time-dependent scaling is a
feature of this kinetic theory, and that it captures key qualitative features
of the scaling of hard gluons in QCD EKT. We then proceed to study scaling
analytically and semi-analytically in this equation. We find that an
appropriate momentum rescaling allows the scaling distribution to be identified
as the instantaneous ground state of the operator describing the evolution of
the distribution function, and the approach to the scaling function is
described by the decay of the excited states. That is to say, there is a frame
in which the system evolves adiabatically. Furthermore, from the conditions for
adiabaticity we can derive evolution equations for the time-dependent scaling
exponents. In addition to the known free-streaming and BMSS fixed points, we
identify a new ""dilute"" fixed point when the number density becomes small
before hydrodynamization. Corrections to the fixed point exponents in the
small-angle approximation agree quantitatively with those found previously in
QCD EKT and arise from the evolution of the ratio between hard and soft scales.

given to obtain the conditions on the system parameters for stable dynamics in
negative as well as positive index regimes of metamaterial waveguides. Similar
to the conventional medium, the three-dimensional (3D) light bullets are highly
unstable in metamaterials with the Kerr type nonlinearity alone. However, in
the negative index regime of metamaterials, stable propagation of light bullets
may occur in the normal dispersion regime balancing with defocusing cubic
nonlinearity and focusing quintic nonlinearity. As in the conventional case,
the stable dynamics is also observed in the case of anomalous dispersion with
focusing cubic nonlinearity and defocusing quintic nonlinearity in the positive
index regime. To test the solitonic nature of the 3D light bullets in the
metamaterials, we also numerically investigate the collision dynamics of two
light bullets. The study shows that the spatio-temporal soliton propagates
without any change except perhaps some phase shift after a collision with
another spatio-temporal soliton in competing cubic and quintic nonlinear
metamaterials. The improper balancing between the linear and nonlinear effects
results to form the bullet molecules in a distorted form with a large amount of
energy after interaction and in the long run, oscillations of the light bullets
grow and the bullets become filaments. We have observed the same collision

$\mathbf{F}_k=\sum_{i=1}^n {f_i}^k,$ where $i\in [n]$. This is also called as
$\ell_k$ norm of the frequency vector $(f_1, f_2, \ldots f_n).$ Another
important problem is to compute the similarity between two data streams by
computing the inner product of the corresponding frequency vectors. The seminal
work of Alon, Matias, and Szegedy~\cite{AMS}, \textit{a.k.a. Tug-of-war} (or
AMS) sketch gives a randomized sublinear space (and linear time) algorithm for
computing the frequency moments, and the inner product between two frequency
vectors corresponding to the data streams. However, the variance of these
estimates typically tends to be large. In this work, we focus on minimizing the
variance of these estimates. We use the techniques from the classical
Control-Variate method~\cite{Lavenberg} which is primarily known for variance
reduction in Monte-Carlo simulations, and as a result, we are able to obtain
significant variance reduction, at the cost of a little computational overhead.
We present a theoretical analysis of our proposal and complement it with
supporting experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets.

thermometry, which poses a major challenge for future quantum-technological
applications. Low-temperature sensitivity might be manipulated by tailoring the
interactions between probe and sample. Unfortunately, the tunability of these
interactions is usually very restricted. Here, we focus on a more practical
solution to boost thermometric precision -- driving the probe. Specifically, we
solve for the limit cycle of a periodically modulated linear probe in an
equilibrium sample. We treat the probe-sample interactions \textit{exactly} and
hence, our results are valid for arbitrarily low temperatures $ T $ and any
spectral density. We find that weak near-resonant modulation strongly enhances
the signal-to-noise ratio of low-temperature measurements, while causing
minimal back action on the sample. Furthermore, we show that near-resonant
driving changes the power law that governs thermal sensitivity over a broad
range of temperatures, thus `bending' the fundamental precision limits and
enabling more sensitive low-temperature thermometry. We then focus on a
concrete example -- impurity thermometry in an atomic condensate. We
demonstrate that periodic driving allows for a sensitivity improvement of
several orders of magnitude in sub-nanokelvin temperature estimates drawn from
the density profile of the impurity atoms. We thus provide a feasible upgrade
that can be easily integrated into low-$T$ thermometry experiments.

of parametric working memory. Such activity `bumps' represent the continuous
location of a cue over several seconds. Pyramidal (excitatory) and

linking neural dynamics to behavioral inaccuracies observed in memory recall.
However, many bump attractor models collapse these subpopulations into a single
joint excitatory/inhibitory (lateral inhibitory) population, and do not
consider the role of interpopulation neural architecture and noise
correlations. Both factors have a high potential to impinge upon the stochastic
dynamics of these bumps, ultimately shaping behavioral response variance. In
our study, we consider a neural field model with separate excitatory/inhibitory
(E/I) populations and leverage asymptotic analysis to derive a nonlinear
Langevin system describing E/I bump interactions. While the E bump attracts the
I bump, the I bump stabilizes but can also repel the E bump, which can result
in prolonged relaxation dynamics when both bumps are perturbed. Furthermore,
the structure of noise correlations within and between subpopulations strongly
shapes the variance in bump position. Surprisingly, higher interpopulation
correlations reduce variance.

parameters. They are found to be rotating faster than the corresponding VFTS
B-type sample but simulations imply that their projected rotational velocities
are inconsistent with them all rotating at near critical velocities. The
de-convolution of the projected rotational velocities estimates leads to a mean
rotational velocity estimate of 320-350 km/s, approximately 100 km/s larger
than that for the corresponding B-type sample. There is a dearth of targets
with rotational velocities less than 0.4 of the critical velocity, with a broad
distribution reaching up to critical rotation. Our best estimate for the mean

Rapidly-rotating B-type stars are more numerous than their Be-type
counterparts, whilst the observed frequency of Be-type stars identified as
binary systems is significantly lower than that for normal B-type stars,
consistent with their respective radial-velocity dispersions. The
semi-amplitudes for the Be-type binaries are also smaller. Similar results are
found for a SMC Be-type sample centred on NGC346 with no significant
differences being found between the two samples. These results are compared
with the predictions of single and binary stellar evolutionary models for
Be-type stars. Assuming that a single mechanism dominated the production of
classical Be-type stars, our comparison would favour a binary evolutionary

to enhance both stability and accuracy. Such methods imply that the systems
must integrate one or more times per co-simulation step (the interval between
two consecutive communications) in order to find the best satisfying interface
values for exchanged data (according to a given coupling constraint). This
requires that every system involved in the modular model is capable of
rollback: the ability to re-integrate a time interval that has already been
integrated with different input commands. In a paper previously introduced by
Eguillon et al. in 2022, the COSTARICA process is presented and consists in
replacing the non-rollback-capable systems by an estimator on the non-last
integrations of the iterative process. The MISSILES algorithm, introduced in
this paper, consists in applying the COSTARICA process on every system of a
modular model simulated with the IFOSMONDI-JFM iterative co-simulation method
(introduced by Eguillon et al. in 2021). Indeed, in this case, the iterative
part on the estimators of each system can be avoided as the global resolution
on a co-simulation step can be written as a single global linear system to
solve. Consequently, MISSILES is a non-iterative method that leads to the same
solution than the IFOSMONDI-JFM iterative co-simulation method applied to

study of the second- and fourth-order CE for the one-dimensional Holstein model

systems as well as the approach to the thermodynamic limit, drawing
distinctions and connections between the behavior of systems in and away from
the thermodynamic limit that enable a greater understanding of the ability of
the CE to capture real-frequency information across the full range of wave
vectors. We find that for zero electronic momentum, the spectral function is
well described by the second-order CE at low and high temperatures. However,
for non-zero electronic momenta, the CE is only accurate at high temperature.
We analyze the fourth-order cumulant, and find that while it improves the
description of the short-time dynamics encoded in the one-particle Green's
function, it can introduce divergences in the time domain as well as unphysical
negative spectral weight in the spectral function. When well-behaved, the
fourth-order CE does provide notable accurate corrections to the second-order
CE. Finally, we use our results to comment on the use of the CE as a tool for
calculating transport behavior in the realistic ab initio modeling of

This defect is partially ameliorated when studying systems in the thermodynamic
limit, enabling the demonstration that the SC-CE corrects many deficits of the
standard perturbative CE in the (non-dispersive) Holstein model. The natural
phonon damping that arises in the more realistic dispersed Holstein model
renders the SC-CE stable, allowing for a complete assessment of the method.

transition the surface associated with the equation of state for the

to a phase separation region ending in a quantum critical point (QCP) at finite

can only carry a limited sensor suite, e.g. a monocular camera instead of a
stereo pair or LiDAR, complicating tasks like dense mapping and markerless
multi-person 3D human pose estimation, which are needed to operate in tight
environments around people. Monocular approaches to such tasks exist, and dense
monocular mapping approaches have been successfully deployed for UAV
applications. However, despite many recent works on both marker-based and

interaction (or communication) between software systems, for example, between a
user-space program and the kernel or between a local application and an online
service. Ensuring conformance to protocols avoids a significant class of
software errors. Subsequently, there has been a lot of work on verifying code
against formal protocol specifications. The pervading approaches focus on
distributed settings involving parallel composition of processes within a
single monolithic protocol description. However we observe that, at the level
of a single thread/process, modern software must often implement a number of
clearly delineated protocols at the same time which become dependent on each
other, e.g., a banking API and one or more authentication protocols. Rather
than plugging together modular protocol-following components, the code must
re-integrate multiple protocols into a single component.
  We address this concern of combining protocols via a novel notion of
'interleaving' composition for protocols described via a process algebra.
User-specified, domain-specific constraints can be inserted into the individual
protocols to serve as 'contact points' to guide this composition procedure,
which outputs a single combined protocol that can be programmed against. Our
approach allows an engineer to then program against a number of protocols that
have been composed (re-integrated), reflecting the true nature of applications
that must handle multiple protocols at once.
  We prove various desirable properties of the composition, including behaviour
preservation: that the composed protocol implements the behaviour of both
component protocols. We demonstrate our approach in the practical setting of
Erlang, with a tool implementing protocol composition that both generates
Erlang code from a protocol and generates a protocol from Erlang code. This
tool shows that, for a range of sample protocols (including real-world
examples), a modest set of constraints can be inserted to produce a small
number of candidate compositions to choose from.
  As we increasingly build software interacting with many programs and
subsystems, this new perspective gives a foundation for improving software
quality via protocol conformance in a multi-protocol setting.

algebraic representations of the associated transformation groups. For the
universal cover, this yields an extension of the Sullivan-Wilkerson theorem to
higher homotopy and cohomology groups. For the cover corresponding to the
kernel of the homology representation, this proves algebraicity of the
cohomology of the homotopy Torelli space. For the cover that classifies what we
call normal unipotent fibrations, we then prove the stronger result that there
exists a nilpotent dg Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}(X)$ in algebraic
representations that models its equivariant rational homotopy type. This leads
to an algebraic model for the space $B\operatorname{aut}(X)$ and to a
description of its rational cohomology ring as the cohomology of a certain
arithmetic group $\Gamma(X)$ with coefficients in the Chevalley-Eilenberg
cohomology of $\mathfrak{g}(X)$. This has strong structural consequences for
the cohomology ring and, in certain cases, allows it to be completely
determined using invariant theory and calculations with modular forms. We
illustrate these points with concrete examples. As another application, we

and Raviart-Thomas elements that makes use of the concept of polynomial
histopolation (polynomial fitting using prescribed mean values over certain
regions). This spectral equivalence, coupled with algebraic multigrid methods
constructed using the low-order discretization, results in highly scalable
matrix-free preconditioners for high-order finite element problems in the full

preconditioner is developed for high-order interior penalty discontinuous
Galerkin (DG) discretizations, for which spectral equivalence results and
convergence proofs for algebraic multigrid methods are provided. In all cases,
the spectral equivalence results are independent of polynomial degree and mesh
size; for DG methods, they are also independent of the penalty parameter. These
new solvers are flexible and easy to use; any ""black-box"" preconditioner for
low-order problems can be used to create an effective and efficient
preconditioner for the corresponding high-order problem. A number of numerical
experiments are presented, based on an implmentation in the finite element
library MFEM. The theoretical properties of these preconditioners are

While high level execution frameworks such as state machines and behavior trees
are commonly used to formalize such decision-making problems, these frameworks
require a mechanism to detect the high-level symbolic state. Handcrafting
heuristics to identify symbolic states can be brittle, and using data-driven
methods can produce noisy predictions, particularly when working with limited
datasets, as is common in real-world robotic scenarios. This paper proposes a
Bayesian state estimation method to predict symbolic states with predicate
classifiers. This method requires little training data and allows fusing noisy
observations from multiple sensor modalities. We evaluate our framework on a
set of real-world peg-in-hole and connector-socket insertion tasks,
demonstrating its ability to classify symbolic states and to generalize to
unseen tasks, outperforming baseline methods. We also demonstrate the ability
of our method to improve the robustness of manipulation policies on a real
robot.

topic. In this work we present a multiscale quantum mechanics classical
molecular dynamics investigation of aqueous mono- and divalent salt
electrolytes in contact with fully polarizable charged graphene sheets. By
computing both the electrochemical double layer and quantum capacitance we
observe a constant electrode specific capacitance with cationic radii and
charge. Counterintuitively, we determine that a switch in the cation adsorption
mechanism from inner to outer Helmholtz layers leads to negligible changes to
the EDL capacitance, this appears to be due to the robust electronic structure
of the graphene electrodes. However, the ability of ions (such as K+) with a
relatively low hydration free energy to penetrate the inner Helmholtz plane and
adsorb directly on the electrode surface is found to slow their diffusion
parallel to the interface. Ions in the outer Helmholtz layer are found to have
higher diffusivity at the surface due to their position in ion channels between
water layers. Our results show that surface effects such as the surface
polarization and the partial dehydration and local structuring of ions on the
surface underpin the behaviour of cations at the interface and add a vital new
perspective on trends in ion mobilities seen under confinement.

each edge to a partner. We obtain a random sphere-homeomorphic surface by
sampling uniformly from the gluings that produce a topological sphere. As $n$
tends to infinity, these random surfaces (appropriately scaled) converge in
law. The limit is a ""canonical"" sphere-homeomorphic random surface, much the
way Brownian motion is a canonical random path.
  Depending on how the surface space and convergence topology are specified,
the limit is the Brownian sphere, the peanosphere, the pure Liouville quantum
gravity sphere, or a certain conformal field theory. All of these objects have
concise definitions, and are all in some sense equivalent, but the equivalence
is highly non-trivial, building on hundreds of math and physics papers over the
past half century.
  More generally, the ""continuum random surface embedded in $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space"" makes a kind of sense for $d \in (-\infty, 25)$ even when $d$
is not a positive integer; and this can be extended to higher genus surfaces,
surfaces with boundary, and surfaces with marked points or other decoration.
  These constructions have deep roots in both mathematics and physics, drawing
from classical graph theory, complex analysis, probability and representation
theory, as well as string theory, planar statistical physics, random matrix
theory and a simple model for two-dimensional quantum gravity.
  We present here an informal, colloquium-level overview of the subject, which
we hope will be accessible to both newcomers and experts. We aim to answer, as

notion of compressibility by using source coding concepts, and (ii) showing
that the `compression error rate' can be linked to the generalization error
both in expectation and with high probability. We show that in the `lossless
compression' setting, we recover and improve existing mutual information-based

to the rate-distortion dimension -- a particular notion of fractal dimension.

not idle, is challenging due to (1) the close proximity that the robots must
operate in to manipulate the structure and (2) the inherent structural partial
orderings on when each part can be installed. In this paper, we present a task
and motion planning framework that jointly plans safe, low-makespan plans for a
team of robots to assemble complex spatial structures. Our framework takes a
hierarchical approach that, at the high level, uses Mixed-integer Linear
Programs to compute an abstract plan comprised of an allocation of robots to
tasks subject to precedence constraints and, at the low level, builds on a
state-of-the-art algorithm for Multi-Agent Path Finding to plan collision-free
robot motions that realize this abstract plan. Critical to our approach is the
inclusion of certain collision constraints and movement durations during
high-level planning, which better informs the search for abstract plans that
are likely to be both feasible and low-makespan while keeping the search
tractable. We demonstrate our planning system on several challenging assembly
domains with several (sometimes heterogeneous) robots with grippers or suction
plates for assembling structures with up to 23 objects involving Lego bricks,

exponentially large. To do so, we fix the the set of sites where the particles

problems that can be applied in multi-agent settings and evaluate them in
Mujoco tasks such as multi-agent Hide and Seek as well as a diagnostic
single-agent maze task. Of the intrinsic rewards considered we found value

iterative root-finding methods on the feedback control targets, we propose a

discovers the location of equilibria and stabilizes them simultaneously. We
call the proposed control zero-in-equilibrium feedback control and we prove
that it is able to stabilize branches of equilibria, except at singularities of
codimension n+1, where n is the number of state space dimensions the feedback
can depend on.
  We apply the method to a simulated evacuation scenario were pedestrians have
to reach an exit after maneuvering left or right around an obstacle. The
scenario shows a hysteresis phenomenon with bistability and tipping between two

open set, and the deployed recognition system will encounter novel objects
belonging to categories unseen during training. Detecting such ""novel category""
objects is usually formulated as an anomaly detection problem. Anomaly
detection algorithms for feature-vector data identify anomalies as outliers,
but outlier detection has not worked well in deep learning. Instead, methods
based on the computed logits of visual object classifiers give state-of-the-art
performance. This paper proposes the Familiarity Hypothesis that these methods
succeed because they are detecting the absence of familiar learned features
rather than the presence of novelty. This distinction is important, because
familiarity-based detection will fail in many situations where novelty is
present. For example when an image contains both a novel object and a familiar
one, the familiarity score will be high, so the novel object will not be
noticed. The paper reviews evidence from the literature and presents additional
evidence from our own experiments that provide strong support for this
hypothesis. The paper concludes with a discussion of whether familiarity-based
detection is an inevitable consequence of representation learning.

fields of commensurate frequencies $r\omega$ and $s\omega$, with emphasis on
the existing symmetries and for which values of the relative phase between the
two driving waves they are kept or broken. Using group-theoretical methods, we
show that, additionally to the well-known half-cycle symmetry, which is broken
for $r+s$ odd, there are reflection symmetries around the field zero crossings
and maxima, which may or may not be kept, depending on how both waves are
dephased. The three symmetries are always present for monochromatic fields,
while for bichromatic fields this is not guaranteed, even if $r+s$ is even and
the half-cycle symmetry is retained. Breaking the half-cycle symmetry
automatically breaks one of the other two, while, if the half-cycle symmetry is
retained, the other two symmetries are either \textit{both} kept or broken. We
analyze how these features affect the ionization times and saddle-point
equations for different bichromatic fields. We also provide general expressions
for the relative phases $\phi$ which retain specific symmetries. As an
application, we compute photoelectron momentum distributions for
$\omega-2\omega$ fields with the Coulomb Quantum Orbit Strong-Field
approximation and assess how holographic structures such as the fan, the spider
and interference carpets behave, focusing on the reflection symmetries. The
features encountered can be traced back to the field gradient and amplitude
affecting ionization probabilities and quantum interference in different
momentum regions.

is desirable to generate narrow beams to extend the coverage of a 5G network by

that a UCCA with a larger antenna element spacing is capable of generating a

centers to systems architectures (e.g., wormhole-routing networks on chip). A
worst-case end-to-end delay in such networks can be computed using Network
Calculus (NC), an algebraic theory where traffic and service guarantees are
represented as curves in a Cartesian plane. NC uses transformation operations,
e.g., the min-plus convolution, to model how the traffic profile changes with
the traversal of network nodes. NC allows one to model flow-controlled systems,
hence one can compute the end-to-end service curve describing the minimum
service guaranteed to a flow traversing a tandem of flow-controlled nodes.
However, while the algebraic expression of such an end-to-end service curve is
quite compact, its computation is often untractable from an algorithmic
standpoint: data structures tend to explode, making operations unfeasibly
complex, even with as few as three hops. In this paper, we propose
computational and algebraic techniques to mitigate the above problem. We show
that existing techniques (such as reduction to compact domains) cannot be used
in this case, and propose an arsenal of solutions, which include methods to
mitigate the data representation space explosion as well as computationally
efficient algorithms for the min-plus convolution operation. We show that our
solutions allow a significant speedup, enable analysis of previously unfeasible
case studies, and - since they do not rely on any approximation - still provide
exact results.

global optimization with lower computational cost. The initial geometry is
inspired in a Y-type micromixer with cylindrical grooves on the surface of the
main channel and obstructions inside it. Simulations for circular obstructions
were carried out using the OpenFOAM software to observe the influences of
obstacles. The effects of obstruction diameter (OD), and offset (OF) in the
range of [20,140] mm and [10,160] mm, respectively, on percentage of mixing
($\varphi$), pressure drop ($\Delta P$) and energy cost ($\Delta P/\varphi$)
were investigated. Numerical experiments were analyzed using machine learning.
Firstly, a neural network was used to train the dataset composed by the inputs
OD and OF and outputs $\varphi$ and $\Delta P$. The objective functions (ObF)
chosen to numerically optimize the performance of micromixers with grooves and
obstructions were $\varphi$, $\Delta P$, $\Delta P/\varphi$. The genetic
algorithm obtained the geometry that offers the maximum value of $\varphi$ and
the minimum value of $\Delta P_s$. The results show that $\varphi$ increases
monotonically with increasing OD at all values of OF. The inverse is observed
with increasing offset. Furthermore, the results reveal that $\Delta P$ e
$\Delta P/\varphi$ also increase with OD. On the other hand, the pressure drop
and the cost of mixing energy present a maximum close to the lowest values of
OF. Finally, the optimal value obtained for the diameter was OD=131 mm and for
the offset OF=10 mm, which corresponds to obstruction of medium size close to

  Our analysis is based on a newly produced grid of $\sim 3\times 10^6$ TRGB

and covering a wide range of metallicity (Z = 0.0001-0.02) and initial mass (M

radiative opacity. Results are also provided in several photometric bands.

this paper, we present a novel attention mechanism for pansharpening called
HyperTransformer, in which features of LR-HSI and PAN are formulated as queries

multi-head feature soft attention module, and a spatial-spectral feature fusion

the pansharpened HSI by learning cross-feature space dependencies and
long-range details of PAN and LR-HSI. Furthermore, HyperTransformer can be
utilized across multiple spatial scales at the backbone for obtaining improved

of molecular clouds based on their morphology. This is achieved using a
recently published catalogue of 10663 clouds obtained from the first data
release of the SEDIGISM survey. The clouds are classified into four different
morphologies by visual inspection and using an automated algorithm -- J plots.
The visual inspection also serves as a test for the J plots algorithm, as this
is the first time it has been used on molecular gas. Generally, it has been
found that the structure of molecular clouds is highly filamentary and our
observations indeed verify that most of our molecular clouds are elongated
structures. Based on our visual classification of the 10663 SEDIGISM clouds,
15% are ring-like, 57% are elongated, 15% are concentrated and 10% are clumpy
clouds. The remaining clouds do not belong to any of these morphology classes
and are termed unclassified. We compare the SEDIGISM molecular clouds with
structures identified through other surveys, i.e. ATLASGAL elongated structures
and the bubbles from Milky Way Project (MWP). We find that many of the ATLASGAL
and MWP structures are velocity coherent. ATLASGAL elongated structures overlap
with ~ 21% of the SEDIGISM elongated structures (elongated and clumpy clouds)
and MWP bubbles overlap with ~ 25% of the SEDIGISM ring-like clouds. We also
analyse the star-formation associated with different cloud morphologies using
two different techniques. The first technique examines star formation
efficiency (SFE) and the dense gas fraction (DGF), based on SEDIGISM clouds and
ATLASGAL clumps data. The second technique uses the high-mass star formation
(HMSF) threshold for molecular clouds. The results indicate that clouds with
ring-like and clumpy morphologies show a higher degree of star formation.

mean metallicity $[Fe/H] = -3.38\pm0.06$. Its low metallicity dispersion
($\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}$ $<$ 0.18 at the 95\% confidence level) as well as
variations in sodium abundances strongly suggest a globular cluster origin. In
this work, we use VLT/UVES spectra of seven C-19 stars to derive more precise
velocity measurements for member stars, and to identify two new members with
radial velocities and metallicities consistent with the stream's properties.
One of these new member stars is located 30 $\deg$ away from the previously
identified body of C-19, implying that the stream is significantly more
extended than previously known and that more members likely await discovery. In
the main part of C-19, we measure a radial velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$ =
6.2$^{+2.0}_{-1.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ from nine members, and a stream width of
0.56$\deg\pm0.08\deg$, equivalent to $\sim$158 pc at a heliocentric distance of
18 kpc. These confirm that C-19 is comparatively hotter, dynamically, than
other known globular cluster streams and shares the properties of faint dwarf
galaxy streams. On the other hand, the variations in the Na abundances of the
three newly observed bright member stars, the variations in Mg and Al for two
of them, and the normal Ba abundance of the one star where it can be measured
provide further evidence for a globular cluster origin. The tension between the
dynamical and chemical properties of C-19 suggests that its progenitor
experienced a complex birth environment or disruption history.

associated metal-poor stars in the halo of the Milky Way lacking an obvious
progenitor. The stream spans an arc of ~15 degrees in the sky, and
orbit-fitting suggests an apocentric distance of ~20 kpc and a pericentre of
~10 kpc. The narrow metallicity dispersion of stars with available spectra,
together with light element abundance variations, suggests a globular cluster
(GC) origin. The observed metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ -3.4), however, is much lower
than that of any known GC. In addition, the width and velocity dispersion of
the stream are similar to those expected from disrupting dwarf galaxies, and
substantially larger than the tidal debris of GCs able to disrupt on C-19's
orbit. We propose here an unconventional model where the C-19 progenitor is a
dark matter-dominated stellar system with GC-like abundance patterns. We use
N-body simulations to show that the tidal disruption of a ~100 pc King-model
stellar component embedded in a ~20 km/s cuspy cold dark matter halo yields
debris consistent with C-19's observed width and velocity dispersion. The
stellar component of the progenitor is fully disrupted, and is spread over two
distinct streams; one corresponding to C-19 and another possibly hiding behind
the Galactic plane. If such companion stream were found, it would suggest that
dark matter-dominated dwarfs may also develop GC-like enrichment patterns, a
finding that would inform our theoretical understanding of the formation of
multiple populations in GCs and dwarf galaxies alike.

efficiently in binaries on moderately eccentric orbits ($0.0 \lesssim e_{\rm b}

stellar binaries and massive black hole binaries. We further find that the
response of a CBD can be divided into three regimes, depending on eccentricity
and mass ratio: (i) CBDs around circular binaries always precess freely,
whereas CBDs around eccentric binaries either (ii) undergo forced precession or
(iii) remain locked at an angle with respect to the binary periapsis. Forced
precession in eccentric binaries is associated with strong modulation of

observable signature in accreting binaries with short orbital periods. We

black hole and tidal spin-up of the second-born black hole using a rapid
population synthesis approach with detailed considerations of spin-up through
tidal interactions. Even with the most optimistic assumptions regarding the
efficiency at which an accreting star receives material from a donor, we find
that it is difficult to form systems with significant mass asymmetry and
moderate or high spins in the primary black hole component. Assuming efficient
angular momentum transport within massive stars and Eddington-limited accretion
onto black holes, we find that $< 1.5\%$ of systems in the underlying binary
black hole population have a primary black hole spin greater than 0.2 and a
mass asymmetry of greater than 2:1 in our most optimistic models, with most
models finding that this criteria is only met in $\sim 0.01\%$ of systems. The
production of systems with significant mass asymmetries and spin in the primary

by means of algebraic operations. The classical limit of a theory of physical
particles and fakeons is described by an ordinary Lagrangian plus Hermitian,
micro acausal and micro nonlocal self-interactions. Quantum gravity propagates
the graviton, a massive scalar field (the inflaton) and a massive spin-2
fakeon, and leads to a constrained primordial cosmology, which predicts the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ in the window $0.4\lesssim 1000r\lesssim 3.5$. The
interpretation of inflation as a cosmic RG flow allows us to calculate the
perturbation spectra to high orders in the presence of the Weyl squared term.
In models of new physics beyond the standard model, fakeons evade various
phenomenological bounds, because they are less constrained than normal
particles. The resummation of self-energies reveals that it is impossible to
get too close to the fakeon peak. The related peak uncertainty, equal to the
fakeon width divided by 2, is expected to be observable.

NSCs are extremely dense stellar environments with conditions that can
theoretically facilitate massive BH formation. Recent work by Stone et al.
(2017) finds that sufficiently dense NSCs should be unstable to the runaway
growth of a stellar mass BH into a massive BH via tidal captures. Furthermore,
there is a velocity dispersion threshold ($40\;\rm{km\;s^{-1}}$) above which
NSCs should inevitably form a massive BH. To provide an observational test of
these theories, we measure X-ray emission from NSCs and compare to the measured
velocity dispersion and tidal capture runaway timescale. We find that NSCs
above the $40\;\rm{km\;s^{-1}}$ threshold are X-ray detected at roughly twice
the rate of those below (after accounting for contamination from X-ray
binaries). These results are consistent with a scenario in which dense,
high-velocity NSCs can form massive BHs, providing a formation pathway that
does not rely on conditions found only at high redshift.

For instance, variational approaches suffer from the need for a large number of
measurements. However, the grid encoding of first quantized Hamiltonians only
requires measuring in position and momentum bases, irrespective of the system
size. Their combination with variational approaches is therefore particularly
attractive. Moreover, heuristic variational forms can be employed to overcome
the limitation of the hard decomposition of Trotterized first quantized
Hamiltonians into quantum gates. We apply this quantum algorithm to the
dynamics of several systems in one and two dimensions. Our simulations exhibit
the previously observed numerical instabilities of variational time propagation
approaches. We show how they can be significantly attenuated through subspace
diagonalization at a cost of an additional $\mathcal{O}(MN^2)$ 2-qubit gates

Self-consistent metallicity, ionization parameter, and pressure maps are
calculated simultaneously through an iterative process to provide useful
measures of the local chemical abundance and its relation to localized ISM
properties. We constrain the presence of azimuthal variations in metallicity by
measuring the residual metallicity offset $\Delta$(O/H) after subtracting the
linear fits to the radial metallicity profiles. We however find weak evidence
of azimuthal variations in most of the galaxies, with small (mean 0.03 dex)
scatter. The galaxies instead reveal that HII regions with enhanced and reduced
abundances are found distributed throughout the disk. While the spiral pattern
plays a role in organizing the ISM, it alone does not establish the relatively
uniform azimuthal variations we observe. Differences in the metal abundances
are more likely driven by the strong correlations with the local physical
conditions. We find a strong and positive correlation between the ionization
parameter and the local abundances as measured by the relative metallicity
offset $\Delta$(O/H), indicating a tight relationship between local physical
conditions and their localized enrichment of the ISM. Additionally, we
demonstrate the impact of unresolved observations on the measured ISM
properties by rebinning the datacubes to simulate low-resolution (1 kpc)

CUDA+MPI programs and providing design rules that discriminate slow from fast

task of redesigning and reoptimizing these programs to effectively utilize each

  In our approach, a directed acyclic graph of CUDA and MPI operations defines
the design space for the program. Monte-Carlo tree search discovers regions of
the design space that have large impact on the program's performance. A
sequence-to-vector transformation defines features for each explored
implementation, and each implementation is assigned a class label according to
its relative performance. A decision tree is trained on the features and labels
to produce design rules for each class; these rules can be used by systems

The large-scale [O III] $\lambda5007$ \AA velocity field shows a superposition
of two disk kinematics: one similar to that of the stars and another along the

medical image SSL. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we
collected a metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) dataset that
aims to optimize MESCC diagnosis and classification for improved specialist

chains to be upward skip-free, we first establish a gateway relation, a concept

spectrally negative self-similar Markov processes on $\mathbb{R}_+$. As a
by-product, we prove that each of these Markov chains, after an appropriate
scaling, converge in the Skorohod metric, to the associated self-similar Markov
process. By a linear perturbation of the generator of these Markov chains, we
obtain a class of ergodic Markov chains, which are non-reversible. By means of
intertwining and interweaving relations, where the latter was recently
introduced in [27], we derive several deep analytical properties of such
ergodic chains including the description of the spectrum, the spectral
expansion of their semigroups, the study of their convergence to equilibrium in

scintillators (slabs). An array of 8 monolithic LYSO slabs of dimensions 3.9 x
32 x 19 mm3 was read out by a 64-channel photosensor containing digital SiPMs.
The position estimation in the detector's monolithic and DOI direction was
based on a calibration with a fan beam collimator and the machine learning
technique gradient tree boosting (GTB). We achieved a positioning performance
in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.44 mm and 2.12 mm for DOI
considering a wide energy window of 300 - 700 keV. The energy resolution was
determined to be 11.3%. We established both an analytical and
machine-learning-based timing calibration approach and applied them for a
first-photon trigger. The analytical timing calibration corrects for electronic
and optical time skews leading to 240 ps coincidence resolving time (CRT) for a
pair of slab-detectors. The CRT was significantly improved by utilizing GTB to
predict the time difference based on specific training data and applied on top
of the analytical calibration. We achieved 209 ps for the wide energy window
and 198 ps for a narrow selection around the photopeak (411 - 561 keV). To
maintain the detector's sensitivity, no filters were applied to the data during
processing. Overall, the semi-monolithic detector provides attractive
performance characteristics. Especially, a good CRT can be achieved while
introducing DOI capabilities to the detector, making the concept suitable for
clinical PET scanners.

the operation count analysis used by asymptotic time complexity with

computation directly over ciphertext. Unfortunately, a key challenge for HE is
that implementations can be impractically slow and have limits on computation

elementary logic gates to implement so performance depends on logical circuit
depth. For even heavily quantized fixed-point arithmetic operations, these HE

  This paper explores the merit of using stochastic computing (SC) encodings to

efficient hardware implementations are available, HE provides support for only
a limited number of primitive operators and their performance may not directly

solved by approximating the integral by a finite summation using a quadrature
rule. The proposed method is then applied to a three-dimensional rigid body
pendulum colliding with a wall, evolving on the product of the
three-dimensional special orthogonal group and the Euclidean space. It is
illustrated that the proposed method exhibits numerical results consistent with
a Monte Carlo simulation, while explicitly generating the density function that
carries the complete stochastic information of the hybrid state.

  Sa, Zhiru Zhang","Structured Pruning is All You Need for Pruning CNNs at Initialization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pruning is a popular technique for reducing the model size and computational
cost of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, a slow retraining or
fine-tuning procedure is often required to recover the accuracy loss caused by
pruning. Recently, a new research direction on weight pruning,
pruning-at-initialization (PAI), is proposed to directly prune CNNs before
training so that fine-tuning or retraining can be avoided. While PAI has shown
promising results in reducing the model size, existing approaches rely on
fine-grained weight pruning which requires unstructured sparse matrix
computation, making it difficult to achieve real speedup in practice unless the
sparsity is very high. This work is the first to show that fine-grained weight
pruning is in fact not necessary for PAI. Instead, the layerwise compression
ratio is the main critical factor to determine the accuracy of a CNN model
pruned at initialization. Based on this key observation, we propose
PreCropping, a structured hardware-efficient model compression scheme.
PreCropping directly compresses the model at the channel level following the
layerwise compression ratio. Compared to weight pruning, the proposed scheme is
regular and dense in both storage and computation without sacrificing accuracy.
In addition, since PreCropping compresses CNNs at initialization, the
computational and memory costs of CNNs are reduced for both training and
inference on commodity hardware. We empirically demonstrate our approaches on
several modern CNN architectures, including ResNet, ShuffleNet, and MobileNet
for both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

request patterns and are implemented using a multitude of services with tight
latency requirements. These characteristics render ineffective existing energy
conserving techniques when processors are idle due to the long transition time
from a deep idle power state (C-state). While prior works propose management
techniques to mitigate this inefficiency, we tackle it at its root with
AgileWatts (AW): a new deep C-state architecture optimized for datacenter
server processors targeting latency-sensitive applications. AW is based on
three key ideas. First, AW eliminates the latency overhead of saving/restoring
the core context (i.e., micro-architectural state) when powering-off/-on the
core in a deep idle power state by i) implementing medium-grained power-gates,
carefully distributed across the CPU core, and ii) retaining context in the
power-ungated domain. Second, AW eliminates the flush latency overhead (several
tens of microseconds) of the L1/L2 caches when entering a deep idle power state
by keeping L1/L2 cache content power-ungated. A minimal control logic also
remains power-ungated to serve cache coherence traffic (i.e., snoops)
seamlessly. AW implements sleep-mode in caches to reduce caches leakage power
consumption and lowers a core voltage to the minimum operational voltage level
to minimize the leakage power of the power-ungated domain. Third, using a
state-of-the-art power efficient all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) clock
generator, AW keeps the PLL active and locked during the idle state, further
cutting precious microseconds of wake-up latency at a negligible power cost.
Our evaluation with an accurate simulator calibrated against an Intel Skylake
server shows that AW reduces the energy consumption of Memcached by up to 71%
(35% on average) with up to 1% performance degradation.

distributed systems against adversarial attacks, by increasing the number of
faulty parties that can be tolerated. While this is well-studied for consensus,
it has been underexplored in the context of fault-tolerant clock
synchronization, even in fully connected systems. Here, the honest parties of
an $n$-node system are required to compute output clocks of small skew (i.e.,
maximum phase offset) despite local clock rates varying between $1$ and
$\vartheta>1$, end-to-end communication delays varying between $d-u$ and $d$,
and the interference from malicious parties. So far, it is only known that
clock pulses of skew $d$ can be generated with (trivially optimal) resilience
of $\lceil n/2\rceil-1$ (PODC `19), improving over the tight bound of $\lceil
n/3\rceil-1$ holding without signatures for \emph{any} skew bound (STOC `84,
PODC `85). Since typically $d\gg u$ and $\vartheta-1\ll 1$, this is far from
the lower bound of $u+(\vartheta-1)d$ that applies even in the fault-free case
(IPL `01).
  We prove matching upper and lower bounds of $\Theta(u+(\vartheta-1)d)$ on the
skew for the resilience range from $\lceil n/3\rceil$ to $\lceil n/2\rceil-1$.
The algorithm showing the upper bound is, under the assumption that the
adversary cannot forge signatures, deterministic. The lower bound holds even if
clocks are initially perfectly synchronized, message delays between honest
nodes are known, $\vartheta$ is arbitrarily close to one, and the
synchronization algorithm is randomized. This has crucial implications for
network designers that seek to leverage signatures for providing more robust
time. In contrast to the setting without signatures, they must ensure that an
attacker cannot easily bypass the lower bound on the delay on links with a
faulty endpoint.

face recognition using only a single 3D template (one scan total, not one per

that enables the learning of the distribution of 3D faces using one 3D template
and a small number of 2D images. This approach could also provide a model for
the origins of face perception in human infants, who appear to start with an

Cox proportional hazards model is one of the common approaches used for primary
analysis. While small-sample corrections have been studied under marginal
models with continuous, binary and count outcomes, no prior research has been
devoted to the development and evaluation of bias-corrected sandwich variance
estimators when clustered time-to-event outcomes are analyzed by the marginal
Cox model. To improve current practice, we propose 9 bias-corrected sandwich
variance estimators for the analysis of CRTs using the marginal Cox model, and
report on a simulation study to evaluate their small-sample properties. Our
results indicate that the optimal choice of bias-corrected sandwich variance
estimator for CRTs with survival outcomes can depend on the variability of
cluster sizes, and can also slightly differ whether it is evaluated according
to relative bias or type I error rate. Finally, we illustrate the new variance
estimators in a real-world CRT where the conclusion about intervention
effectiveness differs depending on the use of small-sample bias corrections.

dominant nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange with weaker
further-neighbor Heisenberg terms. In addition, we find a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interaction which primarily drives a topological gap in the spin-wave spectrum
at the Dirac point, and uncover a non-negligible antiferromagnetic Kitaev
coupling between the S=3/2 Cr moments. The out-of-plane magnetic moment is
stabilized by weak symmetric bond-dependent terms and a local single-ion
anisotropy. Using linear spin wave theory, we find that our exchange parameters
are in reasonably good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering (INS)
experiments. Employing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we study the magnetic
phase transition temperature $T_c$ and its evolution with an applied in-plane
magnetic field. We further demonstrate how future high-resolution INS
experiments on the magnon dispersion of single crystals in an in-plane magnetic
field may be used to quantitatively extract the strength of the
antiferromagnetic Kitaev exchange coupling.

infinite-layer nickelate thin films have been hampered by materials limitations
of these metastable compounds - in particular, a relatively high density of
extended defects. Here, by moving to a substrate

exhibits a low-temperature upturn in the underdoped regime, linear behavior
near optimal doping, and quadratic temperature dependence for overdoping. This
is strikingly similar to the copper oxides, despite key distinctions - namely
the absence of an insulating parent compound, multiband electronic structure,

observing the reached state, and updating the Abstract Model with the acquired

assessment of histochemical stained tissues and has some major limitations. For
example, the preparation of stained specimens for brightfield assessment
requires lengthy sample processing, delaying interventions for days or even
weeks. Hence, there is a pressing need for improved histopathology methods. In
this paper, we present a deep-learning-based approach for virtual label-free
histochemical staining of total-absorption photoacoustic remote sensing
(TA-PARS) images of unstained tissue. TA-PARS provides an array of directly
measured label-free contrasts such as scattering and total absorption
(radiative and non-radiative), ideal for developing H&E colorizations without
the need to infer arbitrary tissue structures. We use a Pix2Pix generative
adversarial network (GAN) to develop visualizations analogous to H&E staining
from label-free TA-PARS images. Thin sections of human skin tissue were first
virtually stained with the TA-PARS, then were chemically stained with H&E
producing a one-to-one comparison between the virtual and chemical staining.
The one-to-one matched virtually- and chemically- stained images exhibit high
concordance validating the digital colorization of the TA-PARS images against
the gold standard H&E. TA-PARS images were reviewed by four dermatologic
pathologists who confirmed they are of diagnostic quality, and that resolution,
contrast, and color permitted interpretation as if they were H&E. The presented
approach paves the way for the development of TA-PARS slide-free histology,
which promises to dramatically reduce the time from specimen resection to
histological imaging.

in datacenters and enterprise settings. Many commonly used NFs such as
firewalls, load balancers and NATs are shallow - i.e., they only examine the
packet's header, despite the entire packet being transferred on and off the
server. As a result, the gap between moved and inspected data when handling
large packets exceeds 20x. At modern network rates, such excess data movement
is detrimental to performance, hurting both the average and 90% tail latency of
large packets by up to 1.7x. Our thorough performance analysis identifies high
contention on the NIC-server PCIe interface and in the server's memory
hierarchy as the main bottlenecks.
  We introduce NFSlicer, a data movement optimization implemented as a NIC
extension to mitigate the bottlenecks stemming from data movement deluge in
deployments of shallow NFs on commodity servers. NFSlicer only transfers the
small portion of each packet that the deployed NFs actually inspect, by slicing
the packet's payload and temporarily storing it in on-NIC memory. When the
server later transmits the processed packet, NFSlicer splices it to its
previously sliced payload. We develop a software-based emulation platform and
demonstrate that NFSlicer effectively minimizes data movement between the NIC
and the server, bridging the latency gap between small and large packet NF
processing. On a range of shallow NFs handling 1518B packets, NFSlicer reduces
average and 90% tail latency by up to 17% / 29%, respectively.

  of Evaluation Results in DevOps","15 pages, 2 figures, 8 code listings",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quality requirements typically differ among software features, e.g., due to
different usage contexts of the features, different impacts of related quality
deficiencies onto overall user satisfaction, or long-term plans of the
developing organization. For instance, maintainability requirements might be
particularly high for software features which are frequently used or bear
strategic value for the developing organization. Also, software features where
even the smallest delays are perceived as negative by the user will be
subjected to specially tight performance requirements.
  We defined an operational DSL to define software quality requirements as
individual feature-level constraints based on quantitative measures. The DSL
provides language elements to define the operationalization of measures from
external systems, time series operations, time filters, and the automatic
evaluation of these feature-level constraints in DevOps based on comparison
operators and threshold values. In addition, quality ratings summarize
evaluation results of features on an ordinal grading scheme. Likewise, quality
gates use these quality ratings to reflect the fitness of software features or
the overall software product using different states. Finally, we show an
example based on a widely-adopted secure mobile messaging app that illustrates
the interplay of the different DSL elements.

autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings. However, existing
camera-based object detection approaches for autonomous driving lack the
ability to provide comprehensive feedback on detection performance for
individual frames. To address this limitation, we propose a novel evaluation
metric, named as the detection quality index (DQI), which assesses the
performance of camera-based object detection algorithms and provides
frame-by-frame feedback on detection quality. The DQI is generated by combining
the intensity of the fine-grained saliency map with the output results of the
object detection algorithm. Additionally, we have developed a superpixel-based
attention network (SPA-NET) that utilizes raw image pixels and superpixels as
input to predict the proposed DQI evaluation metric. To validate our approach,
we conducted experiments on three open-source datasets. The results demonstrate
that the proposed evaluation metric accurately assesses the detection quality
of camera-based systems in autonomous driving environments. Furthermore, the
proposed SPA-NET outperforms other popular image-based quality regression
models. This highlights the effectiveness of the DQI in evaluating a camera's
ability to perceive visual scenes. Overall, our work introduces a valuable
self-evaluation tool for camera-based object detection in autonomous vehicles.

workloads to the cloud requires enterprises to first assess risks by gaining
knowledge of possible network services' anomalies and second, to build trust in
the cloud by designing effective mechanisms to detect such anomalies. This
survey provides scrutiny of network services anomalies that may occur in the
NFV environments. We first present a taxonomy of network service anomalies and
analyze their negative impacts on critical service attributes, including
security and performance. Second, we compare and classify the existing

a small number of times to implement a target measurement with average error
that drops off exponentially with the number of imperfect measurements used. We
hope that could be useful in near-term applications as a type of lightweight
error mitigation of the measuring devices. As well as the view to practical
applications, we consider the question from a general theoretical perspective
in the most general setting where both the available and target measurements
are arbitrary generalised quantum measurements. We show that this general
problem in fact reduces to the ability to reproduce the statistics of
(complete) von Neumann measurements, and that in the asymptotic limit of
infinitely many uses of the available measurement, a simple protocol based upon
'classical cloning' can perfectly achieve this task. We show that
asymptotically all (non-trivial) quantum measurements are equivalent. We also
study optimal protocols for a fixed number of uses of the available
measurement. This includes, but is not limited to, improving both noisy and
lossy quantum measurements. Furthermore, we show that, in a setting where we
perform multiple measurements in parallel, we can achieve finite-rate
measurement reproduction, by using block-coding techniques from classical
information theory. Finally, we show that advantages can also be gained by
making use of probabilistic protocols.

extending pathwise coordinate descent algorithms to more the general bridge or

This allows us to improve computation of the mode-thresholding function for
$\ell_q$ penalized regression problems in practice and introduce two separate
pathwise algorithms. We show that either pathwise algorithm is faster than the
corresponding cold-start alternative, and demonstrate that different pathwise
algorithms may be more likely to reach better solutions.

boundary conditions for partial differential equations (PDEs). It has many
desirable properties, including the preservation of variational consistency and
the fact that it yields symmetric, positive-definite discrete linear systems
that are not overly ill-conditioned. In recent years, the method has gained in
popularity in a number of areas, including isogeometric analysis, immersed
methods, and contact mechanics. However, arriving at a formulation based on
Nitsche's method can be a mathematically arduous process, especially for
high-order PDEs. Fortunately, the derivation is conceptually straightforward in
the context of variational problems. To facilitate the process, we devised an
abstract framework for constructing Nitsche's method for these types of
problems in [J. Benzaken, J. A. Evans, S. McCormick, and R. Tamstorf, Nitsche's
method for linear Kirchhoff-Love shells: Formulation, error analysis, and

goal of this paper is to elucidate the process through a sequence of didactic
examples. First, we show the derivation of Nitsche's method for Poisson's
equation to gain an intuition for the various steps. Next, we present the
abstract framework and then revisit the derivation for Poisson's equation to
use the framework and add mathematical rigor. In the process, we extend our
derivation to cover the vector-valued setting. Armed with a basic recipe, we
then show how to handle a higher-order problem by considering the vector-valued
biharmonic equation and the linearized Kirchhoff-Love plate. In the end, the
hope is that the reader will be able to apply Nitsche's method to any problem
that arises from variational principles.

integration to provide ""background"" dialogue capabilities to any preexisting
Natural Language Processing ability that the robot may already have as part of
its basic skills. By connecting to the cloud, developers are provided with a
sustainable solution to manage verbal interaction through a network connection,
with about 3,000 topics of conversation ready for ""chit-chatting"" and a library
of pre-cooked plans that only needs to be grounded into the robot's physical
capabilities. The system is structured as a set of REST API endpoints so that
it can be easily expanded by adding new APIs to improve the capabilities of the
clients connected to the cloud. Another key feature of the system is that it
has been designed to make the development of its clients straightforward: in
this way, multiple robots and devices can be easily endowed with the capability
of autonomously interacting with the user, understanding when to perform
specific actions, and exploiting all the information provided by cloud
services. The article outlines and discusses the results of the experiments
performed to assess the system's performance in terms of response time, paving
the way for its use both for research and market solutions. Links to

sparse integer least square problem (SILS), which is the NP-hard variant of the
least square problem, where we only consider sparse {0, +1, -1}-vectors. We
propose an l1-based SDP relaxation to SILS, and introduce a randomized
algorithm for SILS based on the SDP relaxation. In fact, the proposed
randomized algorithm works for a broader class of binary quadratic program with
cardinality constraint, where the objective function can be possibly
non-convex. Moreover, when the sparsity parameter is fixed, we provide
sufficient conditions for our SDP relaxation to solve SILS. The class of data
input which guarantee that SDP solves SILS is broad enough to cover many cases
in real-world applications, such as privacy preserving identification, and
multiuser detection. To show this, we specialize our sufficient conditions to
two special cases of SILS with relevant applications: the feature extraction
problem and the integer sparse recovery problem. We show that our SDP
relaxation can solve the feature extraction problem with sub-Gaussian data,
under some weak conditions on the second moment of the covariance matrix. We
also show that our SDP relaxation can solve the integer sparse recovery problem
under some conditions that can be satisfied both in high and low coherence
settings.

search-and-rescue operation, is often constrained by limitations on how agents
can communicate with each other. One such limitation is the case when agents
can communicate with each other only when they are in line-of-sight (LOS).
Developing decentralized planning methods that guarantee safety is difficult in
this case, as agents that are occluded from each other might not be able to
communicate until it's too late to avoid a safety violation. In this paper, we
develop a decentralized planning method that explicitly avoids situations where
lack of visibility of other agents would lead to an unsafe situation. Building
on top of an existing Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)-based approach, our
method guarantees safety at each iteration. Simulation studies show the
effectiveness of our method and compare the degradation in performance with
respect to a clairvoyant decentralized planning algorithm where agents can

datasets of plants intended to be commonly used by farmers and researchers to
create AI-driven solutions in agriculture. As a result, a publicly available
plant species recognition dataset composed of 40,000 images with different
sizes consisting of 8 plant species was created with the system in order to
demonstrate its capabilities. This paper proposes a novel method, called
Variably Overlapping Time-Coherent Sliding Window (VOTCSW), that transforms a
dataset composed of images with variable size to a 3D representation with fixed
size that is suitable for convolutional neural networks, and demonstrates that
this representation is more informative than resizing the images of the dataset
to a given size. We theoretically formalized the use cases of the method as
well as its inherent properties and we proved that it has an oversampling and a
regularization effect on the data. By combining the VOTCSW method with the 3D
extension of a recently proposed machine learning model called 1-Dimensional
Polynomial Neural Networks, we were able to create a model that achieved a
state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.9% on the dataset created by the EAGL-I system,
surpassing well-known architectures such as ResNet and Inception. In addition,
we created a heuristic algorithm that enables the degree reduction of any
pre-trained N-Dimensional Polynomial Neural Network and which compresses it
without altering its performance, thus making the model faster and lighter.
Furthermore, we established that the currently available dataset could not be
used for machine learning in its present form, due to a substantial class
imbalance between the training set and the test set. Hence, we created a
specific preprocessing and a model development framework that enabled us to
improve the accuracy from 49.23% to 99.9%.

problem due to the long-range nature of gravitation. In this work, we conduct
global 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study this effect in the scenario of a
binary system, where the collision of outflows from both stars creates a
suitable configuration. We demonstrate with simulations that a dense and slow
outflow can give rise to a positive torque on the binary and lead to the
expansion of the orbit. As an application, we show that binaries consisting of
an AGB star and an outflowing pulsar can experience $\sim 10~\%$ orbit

We also prove that the gravitational force drops as $O(r^{-3})$ from the center

the number of parameters in convolutional kernels and the complexity of these

decomposition (CPD) and Tucker tensor decomposition (TKD) are two solutions to
this problem and provide promising results. However, CPD often fails due to
degeneracy, making the networks unstable and hard to fine-tune. TKD does not
provide much compression if the core tensor is big. This motivates using a
hybrid model of CPD and TKD, a decomposition with multiple Tucker models with
small core tensor, known as block term decomposition (BTD). This paper proposes
a more compact model that further compresses the BTD by enforcing core tensors
in BTD identical. We establish a link between the BTD with shared parameters
and a looped chain tensor network (TC). Unfortunately, such strongly
constrained tensor networks (with loop) encounter severe numerical instability,
as proved by y (Landsberg, 2012) and (Handschuh, 2015a). We study perturbation

  Physics","16 pages, 3 figures",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In previous work we analyzed databases for 95 classes to show that the
percent grade scale was correlated with a much higher student fail rate than
the 4.0 grade scale. This paper builds on this work and investigates equity
gaps occurring under both scales. By employing a ""Course Deficit Model"" we
attribute the responsibility for closing the gaps to those who are responsible
for the policies that guide the course. When comparing course grades in classes
graded using the percent scale with those in courses graded using the 4.0
scale, we find that students identifying as belonging to racial or ethnic
minorities underrepresented in physics suffer a grade penalty under both grade
scales but suffer an extra penalty under percent scale graded courses. We then
use the fraction of A grades each student earns on individual exam items as a
proxy for the instructor's perception of each student's understanding of the
course material to control for student understanding and find that the extra
grade penalty students from groups underrepresented in physics students suffer
under percent scale grading is independent of the student's understanding of
physics. When we control for more student level variables to determine the
source of the grade scale dependent penalty, we find that it is primarily the
low F grades (partial credit scores) on exam problems that are the source of
these inequities. We present an argument that switching from percent scale
grading to a 4.0 grade scale (or similar grades scale) could reduce equity gaps
by 20-25\% without making any other course changes or controlling for any
incoming differences between students.

learning provides promising tools to tackle this challenge. However, a major
bottleneck of applying model-free reinforcement learning in real world is
safety. In this paper, we propose a safe reinforcement learning framework that
switches between a safe recovery policy that prevents the robot from entering
unsafe states, and a learner policy that is optimized to complete the task. The
safe recovery policy takes over the control when the learner policy violates
safety constraints, and hands over the control back when there are no future
safety violations. We design the safe recovery policy so that it ensures safety
of legged locomotion while minimally intervening in the learning process.
Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the proposed framework and provide an
upper bound on the task performance. We verify the proposed framework in four
locomotion tasks on a simulated and real quadrupedal robot: efficient gait,
catwalk, two-leg balance, and pacing. On average, our method achieves 48.6%
fewer falls and comparable or better rewards than the baseline methods in
simulation. When deployed it on real-world quadruped robot, our training
pipeline enables 34% improvement in energy efficiency for the efficient gait,
40.9% narrower of the feet placement in the catwalk, and two times more jumping

models while protecting privacy by independently training local models on each
client and then aggregating parameters on a central server, thereby producing
an effective global model. Although a variety of FL algorithms have been
proposed, their training efficiency remains low when the data are not
independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) across different
clients. We observe that the slow convergence rates of the existing methods are
(at least partially) caused by the catastrophic forgetting issue during the
local training stage on each individual client, which leads to a large increase
in the loss function concerning the previous training data at the other
clients. Here, we propose FedReg, an algorithm to accelerate FL with alleviated
knowledge forgetting in the local training stage by regularizing locally
trained parameters with the loss on generated pseudo data, which encode the
knowledge of previous training data learned by the global model. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FedReg not only significantly
improves the convergence rate of FL, especially when the neural network
architecture is deep and the clients' data are extremely non-i.i.d., but is
also able to protect privacy better in classification problems and more robust

Cluster-based Contrastive Disentangling (CCD) method to improve GZSL by
alleviating the semantic gap and domain shift problems. Specifically, we first
cluster the batch data to form several sets containing similar classes. Then,
we disentangle the visual features into semantic-unspecific and
semantic-matched variables, and further disentangle the semantic-matched
variables into class-shared and class-unique variables according to the
clustering results. The disentangled learning module with random swapping and
semantic-visual alignment bridges the semantic gap. Moreover, we introduce
contrastive learning on semantic-matched and class-unique variables to learn
high intra-set and intra-class similarity, as well as inter-set and inter-class
discriminability. Then, the generated visual features conform to the underlying
characteristics of general images and have strong discriminative information,
which alleviates the domain shift problem well. We evaluate our proposed method
on four datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in both conventional and
generalized settings.

this paper proposes that new techniques should be developed to help catch

Following ideas from classical computers, a compile-time technique can be
designed to scan quantum computer programs for malicious or suspicious code

novel Ensemble Knowledge Guidance (EKG) to solve both problems at once. First,
we experimentally prove that the fluctuation of loss landscape can be an

sub-network with the smoothest loss landscape at a low cost, we employ EKG as a
search reward. EKG utilized for the following search iteration is composed of
the ensemble knowledge of interim sub-networks, i.e., the by-products of the
sub-network evaluation. Next, we reuse EKG to provide a gentle and informative
guidance to the pruned network while fine-tuning the pruned network. Since EKG
is implemented as a memory bank in both phases, it requires a negligible cost.
For example, when pruning and training ResNet-50, just 315 GPU hours are
required to remove around 45.04% of FLOPS without any performance degradation,
which can operate even on a low-spec workstation. the implemented code is

consistency across views via common latent subspace learning, and preserving
the data topological structure within the same network through graph Laplacian.

of ENSO complexity, which is a central problem in contemporary meteorology with
large societal impacts. The information theory advances a unique way to
quantify the forecast uncertainty and allows to distinguish the predictability
limit of different ENSO events. One key step in applying the framework to
compute the information gain representing the predictability is to build a
statistically accurate dynamical model. To this end, a recently developed
multiscale stochastic model, which succeeds in capturing both the large-scale
dynamics and many crucial statistical properties of the observed ENSO
complexity, is incorporated into the information-theoretic framework. It is
shown that different ENSO events possess very distinct predictability limits.
In addition to the ensemble mean, the ensemble spread also has remarkable
contributions to the predictability. While the information theory indicates
that predicting the onset of the eastern Pacific El Ni\~nos is challenging, it
reveals a universal tendency to convert strong predictability to skillful
forecast for predicting many central Pacific El Ni\~nos about two years in
advance. In addition, strong predictability is found for the La Ni\~na events,
corresponding to the effective discharge process. In the climate change
scenario with the strengthening of the background Walker circulation, the
predictability of sea surface temperature in central Pacific has a significant
response with a notable increase in summer and fall. Finally, the Gaussian
approximation is shown to be accurate in computing the information gain, which
facilitates the use of more sophisticated models to study the ENSO
predictability.

is non-trivial; subsequently, scope of most of the structural reliability

representations can transform any nonlinear dynamical system into a linear
dynamical system, the time evolution of dynamical systems can be obtained by
Koopman operators seamlessly regardless of the nonlinear or chaotic behavior.
Despite the fact that the Koopman theory has been in vogue a long time back,
identifying intrinsic coordinates is a challenging task; to address this, we
propose an end-to-end deep learning architecture that learns the Koopman
observables and then use it for time marching the dynamical response. Unlike
purely data-driven approaches, the proposed approach is robust even in the
presence of uncertainties; this renders the proposed approach suitable for
time-dependent reliability analysis. We propose two architectures; one suitable
for time-dependent reliability analysis when the system is subjected to random
initial condition and the other suitable when the underlying system have
uncertainties in system parameters. The proposed approach is robust and
generalizes to unseen environment (out-of-distribution prediction). Efficacy of
the proposed approached is illustrated using three numerical examples. Results

in the skyrmion size distribution during field-cooling, which leads to a loss
of lattice order and an evolution of the skyrmion liquid phase. Remarkably, the

activates discriminative object regions and falsely includes lots of
object-related backgrounds. As only a fixed set of image-level object labels
are available to the WSSS (weakly supervised semantic segmentation) model, it
could be very difficult to suppress those diverse background regions consisting
of open set objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross Language Image
Matching (CLIMS) framework, based on the recently introduced Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, for WSSS. The core idea of our
framework is to introduce natural language supervision to activate more
complete object regions and suppress closely-related open background regions.
In particular, we design object, background region and text label matching
losses to guide the model to excite more reasonable object regions for CAM of
each category. In addition, we design a co-occurring background suppression
loss to prevent the model from activating closely-related background regions,
with a predefined set of class-related background text descriptions. These
designs enable the proposed CLIMS to generate a more complete and compact
activation map for the target objects. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2012

state-of-the-art methods.

only give the ellipsoidal posterior contours of parameters and lose the
higher-order information beyond Gaussianity. We extend the FM in
gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis using the Derivative Approximation for
LIkelihoods (DALI), a method to expand the likelihood while keeping it positive
definite and normalizable at every order, for more accurate forecasts and

can reduce the difference between FM approximation and the real posterior by 5
times in the best case. The calculation time of DALI and FM is at the same
order of magnitude, while obtaining the real full posterior will take several
orders of magnitude longer. Besides more accurate approximations, higher-order
correction from DALI provides a fast assessment on the FM analysis and gives
suggestions for complex sampling techniques which are computationally
intensive. We recommend using the DALI method as an extension to the FM method
in GW data analysis to pursue better accuracy while still keeping the speed.

observation from \textit{Fermi}-LAT, \textit{Swift}-XRT/UVOT as well as radio
archival data are used for our spectro-temporal investigation. We estimate the
variability time-scale of the source from the flux doubling time in different
flaring regions detected in \textit{Fermi}-LAT observation and the shortest
variability time is used to put a constraint on the minimum Doppler factor and
on the size of the emission region. We have detected a statistically
significant quasi-periodic oscillation feature (QPO) at $\sim$ 17 days. The
broad-band emission is satisfactorily represented during its flaring state with
a leptonic synchrotron and inverse Compton component. From the broadband
spectral modeling, we observe the external Comptonization of the seed photons
originating in the broad line region to be dominant compared to the dusty
torus. This is further supported by the fact that the emission region is also
found to be residing within the BLR. The equipartition value implies the energy
density of the magnetic field in the jet comoving frame is weak, and that is
also reflected in the magnetic field and low power corresponding to the
magnetic field component of the jet. In order to produce the high energy hump,
we need the injection of a large population of high energy electrons and/or the
presence of strong magnetic field; and we observe the later component to be
sub-dominant in our case. The flat rising and steep falling profile in the
$\gamma$-ray SED as well as the break or spectral curvature at $\sim$ 1 GeV are
in commensuration with the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) nature of the

closed systems one can build unitary models using non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
(i.e., $H \neq H^\dagger$) which are Hermitizable (so that one can write,
simultaneously, $H = H^\ddagger$). The essence of the trick is that the
reference Hilbert space $\cal R$ (in which we use the conventional inner
product $\langle \psi_a|\psi_b\rangle$ and write $H \neq H^\dagger$) is
declared unphysical. The necessary Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian $H =

a correct physical Hilbert space $\cal H$. The feasibility of the construction
is based on a factorization postulate $\Theta={\cal PC}$ where, usually, ${\cal
P}$ is parity and ${\cal C}$ is charge. In our paper we propose a more general
factorization recipe in which one constructs $\Theta=Z_NZ_{N-1}\ldots Z_1$, at

interest. Recent memory subsystem upgrades including the introduction of HBM in
FPGAs promise to further alleviate memory bottlenecks. However, modern
multi-channel HBM requires much more processing pipelines to fully utilize its
bandwidth potential. Existing designs do not scale well, resulting in
underutilization of the HBM facilities even when all other resources are fully
consumed. In this paper, we re-examined the graph processing workloads and
found much diversity in processing. We also found that the diverse workloads
can be easily classified into two types, namely dense and sparse partitions.
This motivates us to propose a resource-efficient heterogeneous pipeline
architecture. Our heterogeneous architecture comprises of two types of
pipelines: Little pipelines to process dense partitions with good locality and
Big pipelines to process sparse partitions with the extremely poor locality.
Unlike traditional monolithic pipeline designs, the heterogeneous pipelines are
tailored for more specific memory access patterns, and hence are more
lightweight, allowing the architecture to scale up to more effectively with
limited resources. In addition, we propose a model-guided task scheduling
method that schedules partitions to the right pipeline types, generates the
most efficient pipeline combination and balances workloads. Furthermore, we
develop an automated open-source framework, called ReGraph, which automates the
entire development process. ReGraph outperforms state-of-the-art FPGA
accelerators by up to 5.9 times in terms of performance and 12times in terms of
resource efficiency.

strong interpretability, and speech editability, while the neural vocoders have
the advantage of high synthesis quality. To combine the advantages of two
vocoders, inspired by the traditional deterministic plus stochastic model, this
paper proposes a novel neural vocoder named NeuralDPS which can retain high
speech quality and acquire high synthesis efficiency and noise controllability.
Firstly, this framework contains four modules: a deterministic source module, a
stochastic source module, a neural V/UV decision module and a neural filter
module. The input required by the vocoder is just the spectral parameter, which
avoids the error caused by estimating additional parameters, such as F0.
Secondly, to solve the problem that different frequency bands may have
different proportions of deterministic components and stochastic components, a
multiband excitation strategy is used to generate a more accurate excitation
signal and reduce the neural filter's burden. Thirdly, a method to control
noise components of speech is proposed. In this way, the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of speech can be adjusted easily. Objective and subjective experimental
results show that our proposed NeuralDPS vocoder can obtain similar performance
with the WaveNet and it generates waveforms at least 280 times faster than the
WaveNet vocoder. It is also 28% faster than WaveGAN's synthesis efficiency on a

effectively control the noise components in the predicted speech and adjust the

  Approach in Cloud Environment","24 pages","ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, 2022","10.1145/3524114",,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Cloud computing has been regarded as a successful paradigm for IT industry by
providing benefits for both service providers and customers. In spite of the
advantages, cloud computing also suffers from distinct challenges, and one of
them is the inefficient resource provisioning for dynamic workloads. Accurate
workload predictions for cloud computing can support efficient resource
provisioning and avoid resource wastage. However, due to the high-dimensional
and high-variable features of cloud workloads, it is difficult to predict the
workloads effectively and accurately. The current dominant work for cloud
workload prediction is based on regression approaches or recurrent neural
networks, which fail to capture the long-term variance of workloads. To address
the challenges and overcome the limitations of existing works, we proposed an
efficient supervised learning-based Deep Neural Network (esDNN}) approach for
cloud workload prediction. Firstly, we utilize a sliding window to convert the
multivariate data into supervised learning time series that allow deep learning
for processing. Then we apply a revised Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to achieve
accurate prediction. To show the effectiveness of esDNN, we also conduct
comprehensive experiments based on realistic traces derived from Alibaba and
Google cloud data centers. The experimental results demonstrate that esDNN can
accurately and efficiently predict cloud workloads. Compared with the
state-of-the-art baselines, esDNN can reduce the mean square errors
significantly, e.g. 15% than the approach using GRU only. We also apply esDNN
for machines auto-scaling, which illustrates that esDNN can reduce the number
of active hosts efficiently, thus the costs of service providers can be
optimized.

objects that are visually blended into their surroundings, which is extremely
complex and difficult in real-world scenarios. Apart from high intrinsic
similarity between the camouflaged objects and their background, the objects
are usually diverse in scale, fuzzy in appearance, and even severely occluded.
To deal with these problems, we propose a mixed-scale triplet network,
\textbf{ZoomNet}, which mimics the behavior of humans when observing vague
images, i.e., zooming in and out. Specifically, our ZoomNet employs the zoom
strategy to learn the discriminative mixed-scale semantics by the designed
scale integration unit and hierarchical mixed-scale unit, which fully explores
imperceptible clues between the candidate objects and background surroundings.
Moreover, considering the uncertainty and ambiguity derived from
indistinguishable textures, we construct a simple yet effective regularization
constraint, uncertainty-aware loss, to promote the model to accurately produce
predictions with higher confidence in candidate regions. Without bells and
whistles, our proposed highly task-friendly model consistently surpasses the
existing 23 state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets. Besides, the
superior performance over the recent cutting-edge models on the SOD task also
verifies the effectiveness and generality of our model. The code will be

(FedDG) for person re-identification (re-ID), which aims to learn a generalized
model with multiple decentralized labeled source domains. An empirical method
(FedAvg) trains local models individually and averages them to obtain the
global model for further local fine-tuning or deploying in unseen target
domains. One drawback of FedAvg is neglecting the data distributions of other
clients during local training, making the local model overfit local data and
producing a poorly-generalized global model. To solve this problem, we propose
a novel method, called ""Domain and Feature Hallucinating (DFH)"", to produce
diverse features for learning generalized local and global models.
Specifically, after each model aggregation process, we share the Domain-level
Feature Statistics (DFS) among different clients without violating data
privacy. During local training, the DFS are used to synthesize novel domain
statistics with the proposed domain hallucinating, which is achieved by
re-weighting DFS with random weights. Then, we propose feature hallucinating to
diversify local features by scaling and shifting them to the distribution of
the obtained novel domain. The synthesized novel features retain the original
pair-wise similarities, enabling us to utilize them to optimize the model in a
supervised manner. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed DFH can
effectively improve the generalization ability of the global model. Our method
achieves the state-of-the-art performance for FedDG on four large-scale re-ID
benchmarks.

little mathematical modeling behind specific applications. In this paper, we
focus on the sparse feature segmentation task and make a task-oriented network
design, in which the target objects are sparsely distributed and the background
is hard to be mathematically modeled. We start from an image decomposition
model with sparsity regularization, and propose a deep unfolding network,
namely IDNet, based on an iterative solver, scaled alternating direction method
of multipliers (scaled-ADMM). The IDNet splits raw inputs into double feature
layers. Then a new task-oriented segmentation network is constructed, dubbed as
IDmUNet, based on the proposed IDNets and a mini-UNet. Because of the sparsity
prior and deep unfolding method in the structure design, this IDmUNet combines
the advantages of mathematical modeling and data-driven approaches. Firstly,
our approach has mathematical interpretability and can achieve favorable
performance with far fewer learnable parameters. Secondly, our IDmUNet is
robust in a simple end-to-end training with explainable behaviors. In the
experiments of retinal vessel segmentation (RVS), IDmUNet produces the
state-of-the-art results with only 0.07m parameters, whereas SA-UNet, one of
the latest variants of UNet, contains 0.54m and the original UNet 31.04m.
Moreover, the training procedure of our network converges faster without
overfitting phenomenon. This decomposition-based network construction strategy
can be generalized to other problems with mathematically clear targets and
complicated unclear backgrounds.

limited compared to that of wide band gap crystals. When a glide-symmetric
dislocation is introduced in a 2D crystal, we show that a pair of

We observe experimentally and by mathematical means that already when the

Pareto front remain. The reason for this phenomenon is that the NSGA-II in the
selection stage computes the crowding distance once and then repeatedly removes
individuals with smallest crowding distance without updating the crowding
distance after each removal. We propose an efficient way to implement the
NSGA-II using the momentary crowding distance. In our experiments, this
algorithm approximates the Pareto front much better than the previous version.
We also prove that the gaps in the Pareto front are at most a constant factor
larger than the theoretical minimum.

star is an M4 dwarf with an effective temperature of $T_{eff} = 3185 \pm

often used to evaluate the interestingness of patterns, with the hope to reveal
a ranking that is as close as possible to the user-specific ranking. In this
paper, we formulate the problem of learning pattern ranking functions as a
multicriteria decision making problem. Our approach aggregates different
interestingness measures into a single weighted linear ranking function, using
an interactive learning procedure that operates in either passive or active
modes. A fast learning step is used for eliciting the weights of all the
measures by mean of pairwise comparisons.
  This approach is based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and a set of
user-ranked patterns to build a preference matrix, which compares the
importance of measures according to the user-specific interestingness. A
sensitivity based heuristic is proposed for the active learning mode, in order
to insure high quality results with few user ranking queries. Experiments
conducted on well-known datasets show that our approach significantly reduces
the running time and returns precise pattern ranking, while being robust to
user-error compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

method, we study the overall many-electron dynamics, triggered by the
ionization of outer-valence orbitals of different tautomers of a prototype

initially created averaged hole density of each system, we identify distinctly
different charge dynamics response in the tautomers. We observe that keto form
shows charge migration direction away from the nitrogen bonded with tautomeric
hydrogen, while in enol - away from oxygen bonded to tautomeric hydrogen.
Additionally, the dynamics following ionization of molecular orbitals of
different symmetry reveal that a' orbitals show fast and highly delocalized
charge in comparison to a"" symmetry. These observations indicate why different
tautomers respond differently to an XUV ionization, and might explain the
subsequent different fragmentation pathways. An experimental schematics
allowing detection and reconstruction of such charge dynamics is also proposed.
Although the present study uses a simple, prototypical bio-relevant molecule,
it reveals the explicit role of molecular symmetry and tautomerism in the
ionization-triggered charge migration that controls many ultrafast physical,
chemical, and biological processes, making tautomeric forms a promising tool of
molecular design for desired charge migration.

related to the IEF reach on average a height of 3 Mm over a length of 13 Mm.
The inner (outer) foot points are located at 1.2 (1.9) sunspot radii. The
average field strength difference $\Delta B$ between inner and outer foot
points is +400 G. The temperature difference $\Delta T$ is anti-correlated with
$\Delta B$ with an average value of -100 K. The pressure difference $\Delta p$
is dominated by $\Delta B$ and is primarily positive with a driving force
towards the inner foot points of 1.7 kPa on average. The velocities predicted
from $\Delta p$ reproduce the LOS velocities of 2-10 km s$^{-1}$ with a
square-root dependence. We find that the IEF is driven along magnetic field
lines connecting network elements with the outer penumbra by a gas pressure
difference that results from a difference in field strength as predicted by the

detection of High Frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) with frequency
of $68.14-72.32$ Hz, significance of $2.75-11 \sigma$, and rms amplitude of
$1.48-2.66\%$ in $\delta$, $\kappa$, $\omega$ and $\gamma$ variability classes.
Energy dependent power spectra impart that HFQPOs are detected only in $6-25$
keV energy band and rms amplitude is found to increase ($1-8\%$) with energy.
The dynamical power spectra of $\kappa$ and $\omega$ classes demonstrate that
HFQPOs seem to be correlated with high count rates. We observe that wide-band
($0.7-50$ keV) energy spectra can be described by the thermal Comptonization
component (nthComp) with photon index ($\Gamma_{\rm nth}$) of $1.83-2.89$ along
with an additional steep ($\Gamma_{\rm PL}\sim3$) powerlaw component. The
electron temperature ($kT_e$) of $1.82 -3.66$ keV and optical depth ($\tau$) of
$2-14$ indicate the presence of a cool and optically thick corona. In addition,
nthComp components ($1.97 \lesssim \Gamma_{\rm nth} \lesssim 2.44$, $1.06

\lesssim 4.46\times 10^{-8}$) are found to dominate in presence of HFQPOs.
Overall, these findings infer that HFQPOs are possibly resulted due to the
modulation of the 'Comptonizing corona'. Further, we find that the bolometric
luminosity ($0.3-100$ keV) of the source lies within the sub-Eddington
($3-34\%$ $L_{\rm Edd}$) regime. Finally, we discuss and compare the obtained
results in the context of existing models on HFQPOs.

an active region located near the far-side central meridian from Earth's
perspective. The event and its accompanying shock were remotely observed by the
STEREO-A, STEREO-B and SOHO spacecraft. The interplanetary counterpart (ICME)
was intercepted by MESSENGER near 0.3 au, and by both STEREO-A and STEREO-B,
near 1 au, which were separated by 78{\deg} in heliolongitude. The main
objective of this study is to follow the radial and longitudinal evolution of
the ICME throughout the inner heliosphere, and to examine possible scenarios
for the different magnetic flux-rope configuration observed on the solar disk,
and measured in situ at the locations of MESSENGER and STEREO-A, separated by
15{\deg} in heliolongitude, and at STEREO-B, which detected the ICME flank.
Results: We find that the magnetic flux-rope structure detected at STEREO-B
belongs to the same ICME detected at MESSENGER and STEREO-A. The opposite
helicity deduced at STEREO-B, might be due to the spacecraft intercepting one
of the legs of the structure far from the flux-rope axis, while STEREO-A and
MESSENGER are crossing through the core of the magnetic flux rope. The
different flux-rope orientations measured at MESSENGER and STEREO-A arise
probably because the two spacecraft measure a curved, highly distorted and
rather complex magnetic flux-rope topology. The ICME may have suffered
additional distortion in its evolution in the inner heliosphere, such as the
west flank is propagating faster than the east flank when arriving 1 au.
Conclusions: This work illustrates how the ambient conditions can significantly
affect the expansion and propagation of the CME/ICME, introducing additional
irregularities to the already asymmetric eruption, and how these complex
structures cannot be directly reconstructed with the current models available.

researchers proposed to use a part of important nodes to construct 2-hop labels
(partial 2-hop labels) to cover as much reachability information as possible.
Then, we may achieve better query performance with limited index size and index
construction time. However, partial 2-hop labels do not always perform well on
different graphs.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of how to efficiently compute
reachability ratio, such that to help users determine whether partial 2-hop
labels should be used to answer reachability queries for the given graph.
Intuitively, reachability ratio denotes the ratio of the number of reachable
queries that can be answered by partial 2-hop labels over the total number of
reachable queries involved in the given graph. We discuss the difficulties of
reachability ratio computation, and propose an incremental-partition algorithm
for reachability ratio computation. We show by rich experimental results that
our algorithm can efficiently get the result of reachability ratio, and show
how the overall query performance is affected by different partial 2-hop
labels. Based on the experimental results, we give out our findings on whether
partial 2-hop labels should be used to the given graph for reachability queries
processing.

great evolution in Android malware detection in recent years, is typically
applied in the classification phase. Since the correlation between features is
ignored in some traditional ranking-based feature selection algorithms,
applying wrapper-based feature selection models is a topic worth investigating.
Though considering the correlation between features, wrapper-based approaches
are time-consuming for exploring all possible valid feature subsets when
processing a large number of Android features. To reduce the computational
expense of wrapper-based feature selection, a framework named DroidRL is
proposed. The framework deploys DDQN algorithm to obtain a subset of features
which can be used for effective malware classification. To select a valid
subset of features over a larger range, the exploration-exploitation policy is
applied in the model training phase. The recurrent neural network (RNN) is used
as the decision network of DDQN to give the framework the ability to
sequentially select features. Word embedding is applied for feature
representation to enhance the framework's ability to find the semantic
relevance of features. The framework's feature selection exhibits high
performance without any human intervention and can be ported to other feature
selection tasks with minor changes. The experiment results show a significant
effect when using the Random Forest as DroidRL's classifier, which reaches
95.6% accuracy with only 24 features selected.

data with new relations while avoiding forgetting old ones. Some previous work
has proved that storing a few typical samples of old relations and replaying
them when learning new relations can effectively avoid forgetting. However,
these memory-based methods tend to overfit the memory samples and perform
poorly on imbalanced datasets. To solve these challenges, a consistent
representation learning method is proposed, which maintains the stability of
the relation embedding by adopting contrastive learning and knowledge
distillation when replaying memory. Specifically, supervised contrastive
learning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that
the model can effectively learn the relation representation. Then, contrastive
replay is conducted of the samples in memory and makes the model retain the
knowledge of historical relations through memory knowledge distillation to
prevent the catastrophic forgetting of the old task. The proposed method can
better learn consistent representations to alleviate forgetting effectively.
Extensive experiments on FewRel and TACRED datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and yield strong
robustness on the imbalanced dataset.

The upper bounds of the estimation error and the regret of the adaptive

the set convergence of zero elements with a finite number of observations is
obtained under a cooperative non-persistent excitation condition. It is shown

already predict snap-through bi-stability in a buckled CNT resonator. However,
we prove that the experimental data, in which the snap-through buckling occurs
at a finite frequency, cannot be explained without taking into account
out-of-plane motion. The buckled CNTs are the first type of buckled beams to
exhibit out-of-plane static motion, resulting in a unique three-dimensional
snap-through transition, never before predicted. In addition, we show the
criteria under which these devices can also exhibit latching phenomena, meaning
that they can maintain their buckle configuration when no force is applied,
making these devices appealing for mechanical memory applications.

motion and virtual motion, allowing users to explore virtual environments with
more flexibility. In seated situations with only head movements available, the
difference of stimulus might cause the detection thresholds of rotation gains
to differ from that of redirected walking. Therefore we present an experiment

literature of upper bounds, lower bounds, and applications. The goal is to
store a dynamically-changing set of $n$ items in an array of $m$ slots, while
maintaining the invariant that the items appear in sorted order, and while
minimizing the relabeling cost, defined to be the number of items that are
moved per insertion/deletion.
  For the linear regime, where $m = (1 + \Theta(1)) n$, an upper bound of
$O(\log^2 n)$ on the relabeling cost has been known since 1981. A lower bound
of $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ is known for deterministic algorithms and for so-called
smooth algorithms, but the best general lower bound remains $\Omega(\log n)$.
The central open question in the field is whether $O(\log^2 n)$ is optimal for
all algorithms.
  In this paper, we give a randomized data structure that achieves an expected
relabeling cost of $O(\log^{3/2} n)$ per operation. More generally, if $m = (1
+ \varepsilon) n$ for $\varepsilon = O(1)$, the expected relabeling cost
becomes $O(\varepsilon^{-1} \log^{3/2} n)$.
  Our solution is history independent, meaning that the state of the data
structure is independent of the order in which items are inserted/deleted. For
history-independent data structures, we also prove a matching lower bound: for
all $\epsilon$ between $1 / n^{1/3}$ and some sufficiently small positive
constant, the optimal expected cost for history-independent list-labeling
solutions is $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^{3/2} n)$.

discrete or continuous environments, training agents that cannot generalize
across the two. The fundamental difference between the two setups is that
discrete navigation assumes prior knowledge of the connectivity graph of the
environment, so that the agent can effectively transfer the problem of
navigation with low-level controls to jumping from node to node with high-level
actions by grounding to an image of a navigable direction. To bridge the
discrete-to-continuous gap, we propose a predictor to generate a set of
candidate waypoints during navigation, so that agents designed with high-level
actions can be transferred to and trained in continuous environments. We refine
the connectivity graph of Matterport3D to fit the continuous
Habitat-Matterport3D, and train the waypoints predictor with the refined graphs
to produce accessible waypoints at each time step. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the predicted waypoints can be augmented during training to diversify the
views and paths, and therefore enhance agent's generalization ability. Through
extensive experiments we show that agents navigating in continuous environments
with predicted waypoints perform significantly better than agents using
low-level actions, which reduces the absolute discrete-to-continuous gap by
11.76% Success Weighted by Path Length (SPL) for the Cross-Modal Matching Agent

the wide range of observed variability time scales between the radio and
gamma-ray band. In addition constraints are also provided by very-long-baseline
interferometry (VLBI), which shows a large variety of moving and standing
emission zones with distinct behaviors. We aim to characterize the evolution of
stationary and moving emission zones in the jet and to study their
multi-wavelength signatures through emission maps and light curves. We focus
our study on flare events that occur during strong interactions between moving
ejecta and stationary recollimation shocks. We simulate relativistic jets with
the magneto-hydrodynamic code MPI-AMRVAC and inject non-thermal particle
distributions of electrons in shock regions. We follow the propagation of a
moving shock and its interactions with a structure of standing re-collimation
shocks in the jet. Synchrotron emission and radiative transfer are calculated
in the post-processing code RIPTIDE for given observation angles and
frequencies. We demonstrate the appearance of trailing components behind the
leading moving shock. The latter destabilizes the jet, causing the emergence of
oscillating standing shocks and relaxation shocks. Emissions from these regions
can dominate the overall flux or lead to flare echos in the light curve.
Another observational marker of relaxation shocks appears in time-distance
plots of bright VLBI components of the jet. Our scenario provides a plausible
explanation for radio VLBI observations of the radio-galaxy 3C 111 where
trailing components have been observed during a radio outburst event in 1997.

turbulence (Ivanov et al. 2020) to include variations along the magnetic field.
We consider a three-field fluid model for the perturbations of electrostatic
potential, ion temperature, and ion parallel flow in a
constant-magnetic-curvature geometry without magnetic shear. It is derived in
the cold-ion, long-wavelength asymptotic limit of the gyrokinetic theory. Just
as in the 2D model, a low-transport (Dimits) regime exists and is found to be
dominated by a quasi-static staircase-like arrangement of strong zonal flows
and zonal temperature. This zonal staircase is formed and maintained by a
negative turbulent viscosity for the zonal flows. Unlike the 2D model, the 3D
one does not suffer from an unphysical blow up beyond the Dimits threshold
where the staircase becomes nonlinearly unstable. Instead, a well-defined
finite-amplitude saturated state is established. This qualitative difference
between 2D and 3D is due to the appearance of small-scale `parasitic' modes
that exist only if we allow perturbations to vary along the magnetic field
lines. These modes extract energy from the large-scale perturbations and
provide an effective enhancement of large-scale thermal diffusion, thus aiding
the energy transfer from large injection scales to small dissipative ones. We
show that in our model, the parasitic modes always favour a
zonal-flow-dominated state. In fact, a Dimits state with a zonal staircase is
achieved regardless of the strength of the linear drive provided the system is
sufficiently extended along the magnetic field and sufficient parallel
resolution is provided.

since being proposed due to the high quality of the generated data. While
achieving increasingly impressive results, the resource demands associated with
the large model size hinders the usage of GANs in resource-limited scenarios.
For inference, the existing model compression techniques can reduce the model
complexity with comparable performance. However, the training efficiency of
GANs has less been explored due to the fragile training process of GANs. In
this paper, we, for the first time, explore the possibility of directly
training sparse GAN from scratch without involving any dense or pre-training
steps. Even more unconventionally, our proposed method enables directly
training sparse unbalanced GANs with an extremely sparse generator from
scratch. Instead of training full GANs, we start with sparse GANs and
dynamically explore the parameter space spanned over the generator throughout
training. Such a sparse-to-sparse training procedure enhances the capacity of
the highly sparse generator progressively while sticking to a fixed small
parameter budget with appealing training and inference efficiency gains.
Extensive experiments with modern GAN architectures validate the effectiveness
of our method. Our sparsified GANs, trained from scratch in one single run, are
able to outperform the ones learned by expensive iterative pruning and
re-training. Perhaps most importantly, we find instead of inheriting parameters
from expensive pre-trained GANs, directly training sparse GANs from scratch can
be a much more efficient solution. For example, only training with a 80% sparse
generator and a 70% sparse discriminator, our method can achieve even better
performance than the dense BigGAN.

the region around the K (Dirac) point of the Brillouin zone: creation of a gap
with opposing flat valence and conduction bands, creation of a gap with
opposing concave symmetric valence and conduction bands -- which would
correspond to a material with an effective negative electron-hole mass --, or
closure of the gap when departing from a modified graphene model with a
non-zero field-free gap. We employ time periodic drives with several frequency
components and polarizations, in contrast to the usual monochromatic fields,
and use control theory to find the amplitudes of each component that optimize
the shape of the bands as desired. In addition, we use quantum control methods
to find realistic switch-on pulses that bring the material into the predefined
stationary Floquet band structure, i.e. into a state in which the desired
Floquet modes of the target bands are fully occupied, so that they should
remain stroboscopically stationary, with long lifetimes, when the weak periodic
drives are started. Finally, we note that although we have focused on solid

systems(RS) are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, and the attackers have
the ability to mislead the system to perform as their desires. A widely studied
attack approach, injecting fake users, can be applied on the NRS when the NRS
is treated the same as the other systems whose items are fixed. However, in the
NRS, as each item (i.e. news) is more informative, we propose a novel approach
to poison the NRS, which is to perturb contents of some browsed news that
results in the manipulation of the rank of the target news. Intuitively, an
attack is useless if it is highly likely to be caught, i.e., exposed. To
address this, we introduce a notion of the exposure risk and propose a novel
problem of attacking a history news dataset by means of perturbations where the
goal is to maximize the manipulation of the target news rank while keeping the
risk of exposure under a given budget. We design a reinforcement learning
framework, called TDP-CP, which contains a two-stage hierarchical model to
reduce the searching space. Meanwhile, influence estimation is also applied to
save the time on retraining the NRS for rewards. We test the performance of
TDP-CP under three NRSs and on different target news. Our experiments show that
TDP-CP can increase the rank of the target news successfully with a limited

restoration. Conventional non-local attention processes features of each layer
separately, so it risks missing correlation between features among different
layers. To address this problem, we aim to design attention modules that
aggregate information from different layers. Instead of finding correlated key
pixels within the same layer, each query pixel is encouraged to attend to key
pixels at multiple previous layers of the network. In order to efficiently
embed such attention design into neural network backbones, we propose a novel
Adaptive Cross-Layer Attention (ACLA) module. Two adaptive designs are proposed
for ACLA: (1) adaptively selecting the keys for non-local attention at each
layer; (2) automatically searching for the insertion locations for ACLA
modules. By these two adaptive designs, ACLA dynamically selects a flexible
number of keys to be aggregated for non-local attention at previous layer while
maintaining a compact neural network with compelling performance. Extensive
experiments on image restoration tasks, including single image
super-resolution, image denoising, image demosaicing, and image compression
artifacts reduction, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of ACLA. The
code of ACLA is available at \url{https://github.com/SDL-ASU/ACLA}.

paper, we develop an integrated convolutional neural network feasible to tackle
an arbitrary-length (including one) image sequence suffering from inaccurate

the base component of the input image sequence for the Fusion and Correction

that our FCNet is effective arbitrary-length exposure estimation (both SEC and

utilizes the dimensional reduction, from a higher-dimensional input to a

extracted features from AE are then utilized to generate probability
distributions across the latent space, by passing the features through a
kernel-embedded Perron-Frobenius (kPF) operator. Finally, long short-term

existing benchmark models. Detailed analysis is carried out to evaluate the

exploiting a certain correspondence between the IFDMA signal processing and the
Cooley-Tukey IFFT/FFT algorithmic structure so that IFDMA streams can be
