subject of considerable interest over the past two years. Our review begins
with a general introduction to Lovelock's theorem, and the subject of
Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action for gravity. These areas are of fundamental
importance for understanding modified theories of gravity, and inform our
subsequent discussion of recent attempts to include the effects of a
Gauss-Bonnet term in four space-time dimensions by re-scaling the appropriate
coupling parameter. We discuss the mathematical complexities involved in
implementing this idea, and review recent attempts at constructing
well-defined, self-consistent theories that enact it. We then move on to
consider the gravitational physics that results from these theories, in the
context of black holes, cosmology, and weak-field gravity. We show that 4D
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity exhibits a number of interesting phenomena in
each of these areas.

functional, at basis computation from input to output, and the interactive,
where computation reacts to its environment while underway. Central to any
compositional theory of interaction is the dichotomy between a system and its
environment. Concurrent games and strategies address the dichotomy in fine
detail, very locally, in a distributed fashion, through distinctions between
Player moves (events of the system) and Opponent moves (those of the
environment). A functional approach has to handle the dichotomy much more
ingeniously, through its blunter distinction between input and output. This has
led to a variety of functional approaches, specialised to particular
interactive demands. Through concurrent games we can more clearly see what
separates and connects the differing paradigms, and show how:
  * to lift functions to strategies; the ""Scott order"" intrinsic to concurrent
games plays a key role in turning functional dependency to causal dependency.
  * several paradigms of functional programming and logic arise naturally as
subcategories of concurrent games, including stable domain theory;
nondeterministic dataflow; geometry of interaction; the dialectica
interpretation; lenses and optics; and their extensions to containers in
dependent lenses and optics.
  * to transfer enrichments of strategies (such as to probabilistic, quantum or
real-number computation) to functional cases.

diagnosis and grading, but the manual process for obtaining MC from whole-slide
histopathological images is very time-consuming and prone to error. Therefore,
deep learning models have been proposed to facilitate this process. Existing
approaches utilize a two-stage pipeline: the detection stage for identifying
the locations of potential mitotic cells and the classification stage for
refining prediction confidences. However, this pipeline formulation can lead to
inconsistencies in the classification stage due to the poor prediction quality
of the detection stage and the mismatches in training data distributions
between the two stages. In this study, we propose a Refine Cascade Network
(ReCasNet), an enhanced deep learning pipeline that mitigates the
aforementioned problems with three improvements. First, window relocation was
used to reduce the number of poor quality false positives generated during the
detection stage. Second, object re-cropping was performed with another deep
learning model to adjust poorly centered objects. Third, improved data
selection strategies were introduced during the classification stage to reduce
the mismatches in training data distributions. ReCasNet was evaluated on two
large-scale mitotic figure recognition datasets, canine cutaneous mast cell
tumor (CCMCT) and canine mammary carcinoma (CMC), which resulted in up to 4.8%
percentage point improvements in the F1 scores for mitotic cell detection and
44.1% reductions in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for MC prediction.
Techniques that underlie ReCasNet can be generalized to other two-stage object
detection networks and should contribute to improving the performances of deep
learning models in broad digital pathology applications.

interface is essential for a wide range of systems and motion control
applications. Coupling terms within the dynamics of an inertial pair connected

understudied in system communities. This problem is particularly challenging
from a point of view of modeling the interaction forces and motion state
variables. This paper deals with a generalized motion problem in systems with a
free (of additional constraints) friction interface, assuming the classical
Coulomb friction with discontinuity at the velocity zero crossing. We formulate
the dynamics of motion as the closed-form ordinary differential equations
containing the sign operator for mapping both, the Coulomb friction and the
switching conditions, and discuss the validity of the model in the generalized
force and motion coordinates. The system has one active degree of freedom (the
driving body) and one passive degree of freedom (the driven body). We
demonstrate the global convergence of trajectories for a free system with no
external excitation forces. Then, an illustrative case study is presented for a
harmonic oscillator with a frictionally coupled second mass that is not
grounded or connected to a fixed frame. This simplified example illustrates a
realization and main features of the proposed (general) modeling framework.

By jointly learning these and a task-skill allocation matrix, the network for

solidify in the presence of magnetic fields due to the particles forming chains

solidification process and determine the yield stress of the material. Here, we
investigate how reversible chemical links between particles influence MRF yield
stress and stiffness through rheological testing in flow and oscillation mode.
First, we functionalize particles with phosphonate groups that are expected to
link through hydrogen bonding and find that this MRF exhibits up to 40% higher
yield stress and 100% higher stiffness than an MRF composed of unfunctionalized
particles. To explain this, we model the chemical attraction as an adhesion
that supplements dipole-dipole interactions between particles. Interestingly,
we find that the increase in yield stress is largest for dilute suspensions
that are expected to solidify into isolated chains, while the proportional
increase in yield stress is less for MRF with higher concentrations. This is
explained by the higher concentration MRF forming a body-centered tetragonal
(BCT) lattice in which interparticle adhesion forces are no longer aligned with
the field. To explore the possibility of dynamically tuning interparticle
interactions, we functionalize particles with polystyrene polymers with thymine
terminal groups that will only exhibit interparticle hydrogen bonding in the
presence of a linking molecule, namely melamine. We find that MRF formed with
these particles also exhibit up to a 40% increase in yield stress and ~100%
increase in stiffness, but only in the presence of melamine. In addition to
confirming the role of hydrogen bonding in increasing MRF performance, these
results highlight the possibility of dynamically tuning MRF performance using
magnetic fields and chemical modifications.

particles and fields. What is the fundamental physics behind dark matter and
dark energy? What generated the initial fluctuations in the early Universe?
Polarised light of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) may hold the key to
answers. In this article, we discuss two new developments in this research
area. First, if the physics behind dark matter and dark energy violates parity
symmetry, their coupling to photons rotates the plane of linear polarisation as
the CMB photons travel more than 13 billion years. This effect is known as
`cosmic birefringence': space filled with dark matter and dark energy behaves
as if it were a birefringent material, like a crystal. A tantalising hint for
such a signal has been found with the statistical significance of $3\sigma$.
Next, the period of accelerated expansion in the very early Universe, called
`cosmic inflation', produced a stochastic background of primordial
gravitational waves (GW). What generated GW? The leading idea is vacuum
fluctuations in spacetime, but matter fields could also produce a significant
amplitude of primordial GW. Finding its origin using CMB polarisation opens a
new window into the physics behind inflation. These new scientific targets may
influence how data from future CMB experiments are collected, calibrated, and
analysed.

composition of planets forming around them. We use the GGchem code to simulate
the condensation of solids in protoplanetary disks with a Minimum Mass Solar
Nebula around main sequence G-type stars in the Solar neighbourhood. We extract
the stellar elemental composition from the Hypatia database. We find that a
lower Mg/Si ratio shifts the condensation sequence from forsterite

Fe/S ratio leads to the formation of FeS and FeS$_2$ and little or no
Fe-bearing silicates. Ratios of refractory elements translate directly from the
gas phase to the condensed phase for $T\,<\,1000$~K. However, ratios with
respect to volatile elements (e.g.\ oxygen and sulphur) in the condensates --
the building blocks of planets -- differ from the original stellar composition.
Our study shows that the composition of planets crucially depends on the
abundances of the stellar system under investigation. Our results can have
important implications for planet interiors, which depend strongly on the
degree of oxidation and the sulphur abundance.

tool for understanding their dynamics and evolutionary states. However, in the
case of gravitationally lensed systems, it has proved difficult to model both
lensing and intrinsic kinematics in a way that takes full advantage of the
information available in the spectral domain. In this paper, we introduce a new
method for pixel-based source reconstruction that alters standard
regularization schemes for two-dimensional data in a way that leverages
kinematic information in a physically motivated but flexible fashion, and that
is better suited to the three-dimensional nature of integral field data. To
evaluate the performance of this method, we compare its results to those of a
more traditional two-dimensional non-parametric approach using mock ALMA
observations of a typical high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxy. We find that
3D regularization applied to an entire data cube reconstructs a source's
intensity and velocity structure more accurately than 2D regularization applied
to separate velocity channels. Cubes reconstructed with 3D regularization also
have more uniform noise and resolution properties and are less sensitive to the
signal-to-noise ratio of individual velocity channels than the results of 2D
regularization. Our new approach to modeling integral field observations of
lensed systems can be implemented without making restrictive a priori
assumptions about intrinsic kinematics, and opens the door to new observing
strategies that prioritize spectral resolution over spatial resolution (e.g.,
for multi-configuration arrays like ALMA).

account the relative difficulty of performing `nonlocal' operations that act on
many degrees of freedom at once.) While simply formulated and geometrically
attractive, this notion of complexity is numerically intractable save for toy
models with Hilbert spaces of very low dimensions. To bypass this difficulty,
we trade the exact definition in terms of geodesics for an upper bound on
complexity, obtained by minimizing the distance over an explicitly prescribed
infinite set of curves, rather than over all possible curves. Identifying this
upper bound turns out equivalent to the closest vector problem (CVP) previously
studied in integer optimization theory, in particular, in relation to
lattice-based cryptography. Effective approximate algorithms are hence provided
by the existing mathematical considerations, and they can be utilized in our
analysis of the upper bounds on quantum evolution complexity. The resulting

solving diverse image reconstruction tasks, where a subset of pixel values in
the image is missing. However, it entails a high computational complexity due
to its iterative, blockwise procedure to reconstruct the missing pixel values.
Although the complexity of FSR can be considerably decreased by performing its
computations in the frequency domain, the reconstruction procedure still takes
multiple seconds up to multiple minutes depending on the parameterization.
However, FSR has the potential for a massive parallelization greatly improving
its reconstruction time. In this paper, we introduce a novel highly
parallelized formulation of FSR adapted to the capabilities of modern GPUs and
propose a considerably accelerated calculation of the inherent argmax
calculation. Altogether, we achieve a 100-fold speed-up, which enables the
usage of FSR for real-time applications.

towards the G+0.693$-$0.027 molecular cloud covers four different rotational
transitions of this molecule, two of which ($J$=1$-$0 and $J$=2$-$1) appear
free of contamination from other species. The fit performed, assuming Local
Thermodynamic Equilibrium conditions, yields a column density of
$N$=(6.0$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. The resulting molecular abundance
with respect to molecular hydrogen is 4.5$\times$10$^{-12}$. The column density
of PO$^{+}$ normalised by the cosmic abundance of P is larger than those of
NO$^{+}$ and SO$^{+}$, normalised by N and S, by factors of 3.6 and 2.3,
respectively. The $N$(PO$^{+}$)/$N$(PO) ratio is 0.12$\pm$0.03, more than one
order of magnitude higher than those of $N$(SO$^{+}$)/$N$(SO) and
$N$(NO$^{+}$)/$N$(NO). These results indicate that P is more efficiently
ionised in the ISM than N and S. We have performed new chemical models that
confirm that the PO$^+$ abundance is strongly enhanced in shocked regions with
high values of cosmic-ray ionisation rates (10$^{-15}-$10$^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$), as
occurs in the G+0.693$-$0.027 molecular cloud. The shocks sputter the
interstellar icy grain mantles, releasing into the gas phase most of their P
content, mainly in the form of PH$_3$, which is converted into atomic P, and
then ionised efficiently by cosmic rays, forming P$^+$. Further reactions with
O$_2$ and OH produce PO$^{+}$. The cosmic-ray ionisation of PO might also
contribute significantly, which would explain the high $N$(PO$^{+}$)/$N$(PO)
observed. The relatively high gas-phase abundance of PO$^{+}$ with respect to
other P-bearing species stresses the relevance of this species in the
interstellar chemistry of P.

generalized polylogarithmic function, often called the Lerch function, defined
by $$\Phi_{s}(x,z)= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{k+1}}{(k+x+1)^s}\enspace.$$ We
prove the linear independence over any number field $K$ of the numbers $1$ and
$\Phi_{s_j}(x_j,\alpha_i)$ with any choice of distinct shifts $x_1,\ldots, x_d$
with $0\le x_1<\ldots<x_d<1$, as well as any choice of depths $1\leq s_1\leq
r_1,\ldots, 1\leq s_d\leq r_d$, at distinct algebraic numbers
$\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m\in K$ subject to a metric condition. As is usual in
the theory, the points $\alpha_i$ need to be chosen sufficiently close to zero
with respect to a given fixed place $v_0$ of $K$, Archimedean or finite.
  This is the first linear independence result with distinct shifts $x_1,
\ldots, x_d$ that allows values at different points for generalized
polylogarithmic functions. Previous criteria were only for the functions with
one fixed shift or at one point. Further, we establish another linear
independence criterion for values of the generalized polylogarithmic function
with cyclic coefficients. Let $q\geq 1$ be an integer and
$\boldsymbol{a}=(a_1,\ldots, a_q)\in K^q$ be a $q$-tuple whose coordinates
supposed to be cyclic with the period $q$. Consider the generalized
polylogarithmc function with coefficients $$\Phi_{\boldsymbol{a},s}(x,z)=
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{k+1\bmod(q)}\cdot z^{k+1}}{(k+x+1)^s}\enspace.$$
Under suitable condition, we show that the values of these functions are
linearly independent over $K$. Our key tool is a new non-vanishing property for
a generalized Wronskian of Hermite type associated to our explicit
constructions of Pad\'e approximants for this family of generalized
polylogarithmic function.

holds significant advantages over standard frequentist learning, including the
capacity to quantify uncertainty. Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) is an efficient
gradient-based approximate Bayesian learning strategy that aims at producing
samples drawn from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Prior
work focused on a distributed implementation of LMC over a multi-access
wireless channel via analog modulation. In contrast, this paper proposes
quantized federated LMC (FLMC), which integrates one-bit stochastic
quantization of the local gradients with channel-driven sampling.
Channel-driven sampling leverages channel noise for the purpose of contributing
to Monte Carlo sampling, while also serving the role of privacy mechanism.
Analog and digital implementations of wireless LMC are compared as a function
of differential privacy (DP) requirements, revealing the advantages of the
latter at sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio.

hands and objects in a specific region degrades the ability of the hand-object

called Background Mixup that leverages data-mixing regularization while
reducing the unintended effects in hand-object detection. Instead of mixing two
images where a hand and an object in contact appear, we mix a target training
image with background images without hands and objects-in-contact extracted
from external image sources, and use the mixed images for training the

decarbonization targets calls for a rapid expansion of renewable technologies.
Due to their decentral and intermittent nature, these technologies require
robust planning that considers non-technical constraints and flexibility
options to be integrated effectively. Energy system models (ESMs) are
frequently used to support decision-makers in this planning process. In this
study, 116 case studies of local, integrated ESMs are systematically reviewed
to identify best-practice approaches to model flexibility and to address
non-technical constraints. Within the sample, storage systems and sector
coupling are the most common types of flexibility. Sector coupling with the
transportation sector, specifically with electric vehicles that could be used
for smart charging or vehicle-to-grid operation, is rarely considered. Social
aspects are generally either completely neglected or modeled exogenously.
Lacking actor heterogeneity, which can lead to unstable results in optimization
models, can be addressed through building-level information. A strong emphasis
on cost is found and while emissions are also frequently reported, additional
metrics such as imports or the share of renewable generation are nearly absent.
To guide future modeling, the paper concludes with a roadmap highlighting
flexibility and robustness options that either represent low-hanging fruit or
have a large impact on results.

even more inefficient. On top of that, it is also not possible to detect
internal defects that these parts could have. The use of X-Ray images has made
this process much easier, allowing not only to detect superficial defects in a
much simpler way, but also to detect welding or casting defects that could
represent a serious hazard for the physical integrity of the metal parts. On
the other hand, the use of an automatic segmentation approach for detecting
defects would help diminish the dependence of defect detection on the
subjectivity of the factory operators and their time dependence variability.
The aim of this paper is to apply a deep learning system based on Detectron2, a
state-of-the-art library applied to object detection and segmentation in
images, for the identification and segmentation of these defects on X-Ray
images obtained mainly from automotive parts

Shape to reveal their 3D shape. All these nova remnants but CKVul can be
described by prolate ellipsoidal shells with different eccentricity degree,
from the spherical QUVul to the highly elongated shell with an equatorial
component HRDel. On the other hand, CKVul shows a more complex structure, with
two pairs of nested bipolar lobes. The spatio-kinematic properties of the
ellipsoidal nova shells derived from our models include their true axial
ratios. This parameter is expected to correlate with the expansion velocity and
decline time C3 (i.e., their speed class) of a nova as the result the
interaction of the ejecta with the circumstellar material and rotation speed
and magnetic field of the white dwarf. We have compared these three parameters
including data available in the literature for another two nova shells, V533
Her and FH Ser. There is an anti-correlation between the expansion velocity and
the axial ratio and decline time C3 for nova remnants with ellipsoidal
morphology, and a correlation between their axial ratios and decline times C3,
confirming theoretical expectations that the fastest expanding novae have the
smallest axial ratios. We note that the high expansion velocity of the nova

past decade due to advances in computing power and crystal structure prediction
algorithms (CSPA). However, the computational cost of the \textit{ab initio}
calculations required by CSPA limits its utility to small unit cells, reducing
the compositional and structural space the algorithms can explore. Past studies
have bypassed many unneeded \textit{ab initio} calculations by utilizing
machine learning methods to predict formation energy and determine the
stability of a material. Specifically, graph neural networks display high
fidelity in predicting formation energy. Traditionally graph neural networks
are trained on large data sets of relaxed structures. Unfortunately, the
geometries of unrelaxed candidate structures produced by CSPA often deviate
from the relaxed state, which leads to poor predictions hindering the model's
ability to filter energetically unfavorable prior to \textit{ab initio}
evaluation. This work shows that the prediction error on relaxed structures
reduces as training progresses, while the prediction error on unrelaxed
structures increases, suggesting an inverse correlation between relaxed and
unrelaxed structure prediction accuracy. To remedy this behavior, we propose a
simple, physically motivated, computationally cheap perturbation technique that
augments training data to improve predictions on unrelaxed structures
dramatically. On our test set consisting of 623 Nb-Sr-H hydride structures, we
found that training a crystal graph convolutional neural networks, utilizing
our augmentation method, reduced the MAE of formation energy prediction by 66\%
compared to training with only relaxed structures. We then show how this error
reduction can accelerates CSPA by improving the model's ability to filter out
energetically unfavorable structures accurately.

complex multiphysics nature challenges the accuracy and efficiency of numerical
models. Here, we study the dynamics of rapid fluid-driven granular erosion
through a mesh-free particle method based on the enhanced weakly-compressible
Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method. To that end, we develop and
validate a new multi-resolution multiphase MPS formulation for the consistent
and conservative form of the governing equations, including particle
stabilization techniques. First, we discuss the numerical accuracy and
convergence of the proposed approximation operators through two numerical
benchmark cases: the multi-viscosity Poiseuille flow and the multi-density
hydrostatic pressure. Then, coupling the developed model with a generalized
rheology equation, we investigate the water dam-break waves over movable beds.
The particle convergence study confirms that the proposed multi-resolution
formulation predicts the analytical solutions with acceptable accuracy and
order of convergence. Validating the multiphase granular flow reveals that the
mechanical behavior of this fluid-driven problem is highly sensitive to the
water-sediment density ratio; the bed with lighter grains experiences extreme
erosion and interface deformations. For the bed with a heavier material but
different geometrical setups, the surge speed and the transport layer thickness
remain almost identical (away from the gate). Furthermore, while the
multi-resolution model accurately estimates the global sediment dynamics, the
single-resolution model underestimates the flow evolution. Overall, the
qualitative and quantitative analysis of results emphasizes the importance of
multi-scale multi-density interactions in fluid-driven modeling.

Defending against such attacks is essential to maintaining the integrity of the

comprehensive manual review infeasible.
  We present Amalfi, a machine-learning based approach for automatically
detecting potentially malicious packages comprised of three complementary
techniques. We start with classifiers trained on known examples of malicious
and benign packages. If a package is flagged as malicious by a classifier, we
then check whether it includes metadata about its source repository, and if so
whether the package can be reproduced from its source code. Packages that are
reproducible from source are not usually malicious, so this step allows us to
weed out false positives. Finally, we also employ a simple textual
clone-detection technique to identify copies of malicious packages that may
have been missed by the classifiers, reducing the number of false negatives.
  Amalfi improves on the state of the art in that it is lightweight, requiring
only a few seconds per package to extract features and run the classifiers, and
gives good results in practice: running it on 96287 package versions published

linear, incompressible, and isotropic fluid, having a viscous shear stress, an
active chiral driving stress, and a Hall stress allowed by the lack of
time-reversal symmetry. The droplet interacts with itself through its driven
internal mechanics and by driving flows in the underlying 3D Stokes phase. We
pose the dynamics as the solution to a singular integral-differential equation,
over the droplet surface, using the mapping from surface stress to surface
velocity for the 3D Stokes equations. Specializing to the case of axisymmetric
droplets, exact representations for the chiral surface flow are given in terms
of solutions to a singular integral equation, solved using both analytical and
numerical techniques. For a disc-shaped monolayer, we additionally employ a
semi-analytical solution that hinges on an orthogonal basis of Bessel functions
and allows for efficient computation of the monolayer velocity field, which
ranges from a nearly solid-body rotation to a unidirectional edge current
depending on the subphase depth and the Saffman-Delbruck length. Except in the
near-wall limit, these solutions have divergent surface shear stresses at

the similar idea. We ask here the opposite one i.e can we generate a graph from
the density matrix? To investigate this question, we have constructed a unital
map $\phi$ such that $\phi(\rho)=L_{\rho}+\rho$, where the quantum state is
described by the density operator $\rho$. The entries of $L_{\rho}$ depends on
the entries of the quantum state $\rho$ and the entries are taken in such a way
that $L_{\rho}$ satisfies all the properties of the Laplacian. This make
possible to design a simple connected weighted graph from the Laplacian
$L_{\rho}$. We show that the constructed unital map $\phi$ characterize the
quantum state with respect to its purity by showing that if the determinant of
the matrix $\phi(\rho)-I$ is positive then the quantum state $\rho$ represent a
mixed state. Moreover, we study the positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion
in terms of the spectrum of the density matrix under investigation and the
spectrum of the Laplacian associated with the given density matrix.
Furthermore, we derive the inequality between the minimum eigenvalue of the
density matrix and the weight of the edges of the connected subgraph of a

processes at the lowest frequencies, where the minimum acquisition time is so
long that it is impossible to average on a sequence of data record. Therefore,
averaging is possible only on simultaneous observation of multiple instruments.
This is the case of radio astronomy, which we take as the paradigm, but
examples may be found in other fields such as climatology and geodesy. We
compare the Bayesian confidence interval of the red-noise parameter using two
estimators, the spectrum average and the cross-spectrum. While the spectrum
average is widely used, the cross-spectrum using multiple instruments is rather
uncommon. With two instruments, the cross-spectrum estimator leads to the
Variance-Gamma distribution. A generalization to $q$ devices is provided, with
the example of the observation of millisecond pulsars with 5 radio telescopes.

  As far as we know, it might be that a tournament $H$ has this property if and
only if its vertex set has a linear ordering in which its backedges form a
forest. Certainly this condition is necessary, but we are far from proving
sufficiency. We make a small step in this direction, showing that if a

EH-property (except for one case, that we could not decide). In particular,
every tournament with at most six vertices has the property, except for three
that we could not decide. We also give a seven-vertex tournament that does not
have the strong EH-property.
  This is related to the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture, which in one form says that
for every tournament $H$ there exists $\tau>0$ such that every tournament $G$
not containing $H$ as a subtournament has a transitive subtournament of
cardinality at least $|G|^\tau$. Let us say that a tournament $H$ satisfying

still carries risks: AI learning them will inevitably also gain information on
human irrationalities and human behaviour/policy. Both of these can be
dangerous: knowing human policy allows an AI to become generically more

cloud, nearly all clumps follow the column-density-mass trend N~M^s, where s =
0.38 +- 0.03 is near the pressure-bounded limit s=1/3. This trend is expected
when gravitationally unbound clumps in VE have similar velocity dispersion and
external pressure. Nine of these clouds also harbor one or two distinctly more
massive clumps. These properties allow a VE model of bound and unbound clumps
in each cloud, where the most massive clump has the VE critical mass. These
models indicate that 213 clumps have velocity dispersion 1-2 km s^(-1), mean
external pressure 0.5-4 x 10^8 cm^(-3) K, bound clump fraction 0.06, and
typical virial parameter alpha=4-15. These mostly unbound clumps may be in VE
with their turbulent cloud pressure, possibly driven by inflow from the
galactic bar. In contrast, most Sgr B2 clumps are bound according to their
associated sources and N-M trends. When the CMZ clumps are combined into mass
distributions, their typical power-law slope is analyzed with a stopped
accretion model. It also indicates that most clumps are unbound and cannot grow
significantly, due to their similar time scales of accretion and dispersal,
~0.2 Myr. Thus, virial and dynamical analyses of the most extensive clump
census available indicate that star formation in the CMZ may be suppressed by a
significant deficit of gravitationally bound clumps.

Grassmannians and the CKP integrable hierarchy. The Lagrange map from the
Lagrangian Grassmannian of maximal isotropic (Lagrangian) subspaces of a finite
dimensional symplectic vector space $V\oplus V^*$ into the projectivization of
the exterior space $\Lambda V$ is defined by restricting the Pl\""ucker map on
the full Grassmannian to the Lagrangian sub-Grassmannian and composing it with
projection to the subspace of symmetric elements under dualization $V
\leftrightarrow V^*$. In terms of the affine coordinate matrix on the big cell,
this reduces to the principal minors map, whose image is cut out by the $2
\times 2 \times 2$ quartic {\em hyperdeterminantal} relations. To apply this to
the CKP hierarchy, the Lagrangian Grassmannian framework is extended to
infinite dimensions, with $V\oplus V^*$ replaced by a polarized Hilbert space $
{\mathcal H} ={\mathcal H}_+\oplus {\mathcal H}_-$, with symplectic form
$\omega$. The image of the Plucker map in the fermionic Fock space ${\mathcal
F}= \Lambda^{\infty/2}{\mathcal H}$ is identified and the infinite dimensional
Lagrangian map is defined. The linear constraints defining reduction to the CKP
hierarchy are expressed as a fermionic null condition and the infinite analogue
of the hyperdeterminantal relations is deduced. A multiparametric family of
such relations is shown to be satisfied by the evaluation of the
$\tau$-function at translates of a point in the space of odd flow variables
along the cubic lattices generated by power sums in the parameters.

[arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited
in computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be
completely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum

technique for the diagnosis and treatment of early-stage lung cancer. During
VATS, large lung deformation occurs as a result of a change of patient position
and a pneumothorax (lung deflation), which hinders the intraoperative
localization of pulmonary nodules. Modeling lung deformation during VATS for
surgical navigation is desirable, but the mechanisms causing such deformation
are yet not well-understood. In this study, we estimate, quantify and analyze
the lung deformation occurring after a change of patient position during VATS.
We used deformable image registration to estimate the lung deformation between
a preoperative CT (in supine position) and an intraoperative CBCT (in lateral
decubitus position) of six VATS clinical cases. We accounted for sliding motion
between lobes and against the thoracic wall and obtained consistently low
average target registration errors (under 1 mm). We observed large lung
displacement (up to 40 mm); considerable sliding motion between lobes and
against the thoracic wall (up to 30 mm); and localized volume changes
indicating deformation. These findings demonstrate the complexity of the change
of patient position phenomenon, which should necessarily be taken into account
to model lung deformation for intraoperative guidance during VATS.

  Methods: The BART toolbox offers a rich set of implementations of calibration

this work, BART was extended by a non-linear operator framework that provides
automatic differentiation to allow computation of gradients. Existing
MRI-specific operators of BART, such as the non-uniform fast Fourier transform,
are directly integrated into this framework and are complemented by common
building blocks used in neural networks. To evaluate the use of the framework
for advanced deep-learning-based reconstruction, two state-of-the-art unrolled

implemented.
  Results: State-of-the-art deep image-reconstruction networks can be
constructed and trained using BART's gradient based optimization algorithms.
The BART implementation achieves a similar performance in terms of training
time and reconstruction quality compared to the original implementations based
on TensorFlow.
  Conclusion: By integrating non-linear operators and neural networks into

cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The mapping between galaxy and halo
variables is stochastic in the absence of perfect information, but conventional
machine learning models are deterministic and hence cannot capture its
intrinsic scatter. To overcome this limitation, we design an ensemble of neural
networks with a Gaussian loss function that predict probability distributions,
allowing us to model statistical uncertainties in the galaxy-halo connection as
well as its best-fit trends. We extract a number of galaxy and halo variables
from the Horizon-AGN and IllustrisTNG100-1 simulations and quantify the extent
to which knowledge of some subset of one enables prediction of the other. This
allows us to identify the key features of the galaxy-halo connection and
investigate the origin of its scatter in various projections. We find that
while halo properties beyond mass account for up to 50 per cent of the scatter
in the halo-to-stellar mass relation, the prediction of stellar half-mass
radius or total gas mass is not substantially improved by adding further halo
properties. We also use these results to investigate semi-analytic models for
galaxy size in the two simulations, finding that assumptions relating galaxy
size to halo size or spin are not successful.

real-time voltage control in power systems, including an online method to
estimate the bus admittance matrix $\mathbf{Y}$ to let it be time-varying and
unknown a priori. The prevalent control designs are either (a) centralized,
providing optimal solutions but less scalable and susceptible to single-point
failures/attacks, or (b) decentralized or localized, having increased
scalability and attack resilience but are suboptimal. The proposed distributed
solution offers the attractive features of both methodologies, where
neighboring nodes share state information to attain a globally optimal
solution. In addition, the presented framework provides a data-driven
estimation of Y to circumvent the challenging issue of acquiring accurate
knowledge of the line impedance (required to form Y). We first introduce the
centralized version of the predictive voltage control problem and then transfer
it to a distributed version. The distributed version is solved via the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), using only local

system. The proposed framework is resilient to prediction uncertainty, modeling
error, and communication link failure, and the in-built redundancy within the

high-energy colliders. Despite the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large
Hadron Collider, and of the overwhelming successes of the Standard Model,
several observational and theoretical problems remain to be addressed. In
addition to neutrino oscillation phenomena, the Standard Model fails to explain
the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and does not offer a viable dark matter
candidate. In recent years, numerous deviations between the Standard Model
prediction and experimental measurements have been identified; interestingly,
most are closely connected to lepton flavours.
  In this thesis we have explored several aspects of flavour physics, focusing
on the phenomenological implications of models of massive neutrinos, and of
several Standard Model extensions capable of accommodating current tensions on
anomalous magnetic moments of charged leptons and several $B$-meson decay

under arbitrary strains by employing irreducible second order displacement
derivatives of the Born-Oppenheimer potential and their strain dependence,
which are efficiently and precisely computed using the lone irreducible

discretized strain grid interpolation and a Taylor series expansion in
symmetrized strain. We illustrate our approach by evaluating the temperature

expansion in thoria (ThO$_2$) using density functional theory with three
exchange-correlation functionals. The QHA results are compared to our

our domain knowledge-informed self-supervised approaches (pose contrastive

space. Despite being learned with no supervision, it is surprisingly
well-behaved and remarkably disentangled. Combined with StyleGAN's visual
quality, these properties gave rise to unparalleled editing capabilities.
However, the control offered by StyleGAN is inherently limited to the

well-known that over-parameterized networks tend to overfit and do not
generalize. In this work, we propose a principled approach for robust training
of over-parameterized deep networks in classification tasks where a proportion

is sparse and incoherent with the network learned from clean data, so we model
the noise and learn to separate it from the data. Specifically, we model the
label noise via another sparse over-parameterization term, and exploit implicit
algorithmic regularizations to recover and separate the underlying corruptions.
Remarkably, when trained using such a simple method in practice, we demonstrate
state-of-the-art test accuracy against label noise on a variety of real
datasets. Furthermore, our experimental results are corroborated by theory on
simplified linear models, showing that exact separation between sparse noise
and low-rank data can be achieved under incoherent conditions. The work opens

behave as active droplets, which often break symmetry and change shape
spontaneously. Here, I show that active nematic droplets can experience a
fingering instability. I consider an active fluid that acquires nematic order
through anchoring at the droplet interface, and I predict its morphological
stability in terms of three dimensionless parameters: the anchoring angle, the
penetration length of nematic order compared to droplet size, and an active
capillary number. Droplets with extensile (contractile) stresses and planar
(homeotropic) anchoring are unstable above a critical activity or droplet size.
This instability is interfacial in nature: It arises through the coupling of
active flows with interface motion, even when the bulk instability of active
nematics cannot take place. In contrast to the dynamic states characteristic of
active matter, the instability could produce static fingering patterns. The
number of fingers increases with activity but varies non-monotonically with the
nematic penetration length. Overall, these results can help to understand the
self-organized shapes of biological systems, and to design patterns in active
materials.

is desirable to jointly train models across aggregations of datasets to enhance
data volume and diversity. However, label spaces differ across datasets and may
even be in conflict with one another. This paper proposes UniSeg, an effective
approach to automatically train models across multiple datasets with differing
label spaces, without any manual relabeling efforts. Specifically, we propose
two losses that account for conflicting and co-occurring labels to achieve
better generalization performance in unseen domains. First, a gradient conflict
in training due to mismatched label spaces is identified and a
class-independent binary cross-entropy loss is proposed to alleviate such label
conflicts. Second, a loss function that considers class-relationships across
datasets is proposed for a better multi-dataset training scheme. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses on road-scene datasets show that UniSeg

work, we investigate the environment induced effects on transport properties
for quasi-periodic systems, namely the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper

B\""uttiker probe approach. We first consider voltage probe situation and study
the electrical conductance properties in the linear response regime. At zero
temperature, we observe enhancement in conductance at all the no-transport
regimes, located both inside and outside of the band of the original system,
for small probe coupling strength $\gamma$ with a power-law scaling $\gamma^4$.
Whereas, for large probe coupling strengths, the conductance at all Fermi
energies is the same and decays as a power-law with scaling $1/\gamma^4$. This
particular scaling survives even in the finite-temperature limit.
Interestingly, this scaling result is different from the one recently predicted
following the local Lindblad master equation approach. The transport eventually
becomes diffusive for all energy ranges and in all regimes of the original
model for a sufficiently strong coupling with the probes. We further extend our
study and consider voltage-temperature probes to analyze the thermoelectric
performance of the chain in terms of the figure of merit. We also demonstrate
the validity of two recently obtained bounds on thermoelectric efficiency that
are tighter than the seminal Carnot bound and express the same in terms of the

involving content level and appearance level. While the latter is concerned
with appearance style, the former problem arises from a different mechanism,
i.e., content mismatch in attributes such as camera viewpoint, object placement

gap, the content-level discrepancy has not been broadly studied. To address the
content-level misalignment, we propose an attribute descent approach that
automatically optimizes engine attributes to enable synthetic data to
approximate real-world data. We verify our method on object-centric tasks,
wherein an object takes up a major portion of an image. In these tasks, the
search space is relatively small, and the optimization of each attribute yields
sufficiently obvious supervision signals. We collect a new synthetic asset
VehicleX, and reformat and reuse existing the synthetic assets ObjectX and
PersonX. Extensive experiments on image classification and object
re-identification confirm that adapted synthetic data can be effectively used
in three scenarios: training with synthetic data only, training data
augmentation and numerically understanding dataset content.

different figures of merit including conversion efficiency, bandwidth, and
added noise. Here we utilize the concept of quantum capacity, the highest

performance of a transducer. By evaluating the continuous-time quantum capacity
across the conversion band, quantum capacity can serve as a single metric that
unifies various desirable criteria of a transducer -- high efficiency, large
bandwidth, and low noise. Moreover, using the quantum capacities of bosonic
pure-loss channels as benchmarks, we investigate the optimal designs of generic
quantum transduction schemes implemented by transmitting external signals
through a coupled bosonic chain. Under the physical constraint of a bounded
maximal coupling rate $g_{\rm max}$, the highest continuous-time quantum
capacity $Q^{\rm max} \approx 31.4 g_{\rm max}$ is achieved by transducers with
a maximally flat conversion frequency response, analogous to Butterworth

We have cataloged the satellites of 25 of the 31 such hosts, with another five
taken from the literature. All hosts are surveyed out to at least 150 projected
kpc ($\sim R_\mathrm{vir}/2$) with the majority surveyed to 300 kpc ($\sim

extensive tests with injected galaxies, the catalogs are complete to
$M_V\sim-9$ mag and $\mu_{0,V}\sim26.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Candidates are
confirmed to be real satellites through distance measurements including
redshift, tip of the red giant branch, and surface brightness fluctuations.
Across all 30 surveyed hosts, there are 338 confirmed satellites with a further
105 candidates awaiting distance measurement. For the vast majority of these,
we provide consistent multi-band S\'{e}rsic photometry. We show that satellite
abundance correlates with host mass, with the MW being quite typical amongst
comparable systems, and that satellite quenched fraction rises steeply with
decreasing satellite mass, mirroring the quenched fraction for the MW and M31.
The ELVES survey represents a massive increase in the statistics of surveyed

We use a high-resolution cosmological suite of simulations Romulus and compare
simulated central galaxies in group-scale halos at $z=0$ to observed BGGs. The
comparison encompasses the stellar mass-halo mass relation, various kinematic
properties and scaling relations, morphologies, and the star formation rates.
Generally, we find that Romulus reproduces the full spectrum of diversity in
the properties of the BGGs very well, albeit with a tendency toward lower than
the observed fraction of quenched BGGs. We find both early-type S0 and
elliptical galaxies as well as late-type disk galaxies; we find Romulus
galaxies that are fast-rotators as well as slow-rotators; and we observe
galaxies transforming from late-type to early-type following strong dynamical
interactions with satellites. We also carry out case studies of selected
Romulus galaxies to explore the link between their properties, and the recent
evolution of the stellar system as well as the surrounding
intragroup/circumgalactic medium. In general, mergers/strong interactions
quench star-forming activity and disrupt the stellar disk structure. Sometimes,
however, such interactions can also trigger star-formation and galaxy
rejuvenation. Black hole feedback can also lead to a decline of the star
formation rate but by itself, it does not typically lead to complete quenching
of the star formation activity in the BGGs.

age or internal rotation. An accurate spectroscopic determination of its
chemical properties is still missing. We analyse spectra obtained with MUSE in
adaptive optics mode of 1167 stars in both components of this cluster (NGC1850A
and NGC1850B). Thanks to this dataset, we measure an average metallicity of
<[M/H]>=-0.31 +/- 0.01, a mean Ba abundance of <[Ba/Fe]>=+0.40 +/- 0.02 and a
systemic radial velocity of <v_{LOS}>=251.1 +/- 0.3 km/s. The dispersion of the
radial velocities suggests a dynamical mass of log(M/Ms)=4.84 +/- 0.1, while no
significant systemic rotation is detected. We detect a significant bimodality
in OI line strength among the TO stars of NGC1850A with ~66% of stars with
[O/Fe]~-0.16 and the rest with no detectable line. The majority of O-weak stars
populate preferentially the red side of the MSTO and show H lines in emission,
suggesting that they are Be stars rotating close to their critical velocity.
Among normal MSTO stars, red stars have on average broader line profiles than
blue ones, suggesting a correlation between colour and rotational velocity. The
mean metallicity of this cluster lies at the metal-rich side of the metallicity
distribution of the LMC following its age-metallicity relation. The Ba and O
abundances agree with those measured in the bar of this galaxy. The observed
spread in OI line width among its MS stars can be interpreted as an effect of
rotational mixing occurring in the envelopes of O-weak stars. The correlation
between line broadening and colour suggests that the observed colour spread
among turn-off stars can be due to a wide range in rotational velocity covered
by these stars.

information from baryonic fields such as the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)

baryonic physics that is usually modeled by expensive hydrodynamic simulations.
We train neural networks on the IllustrisTNG-300 cosmological simulation to
predict the continuous electron pressure field in galaxy clusters from
gravity-only simulations. Modeling clusters is challenging for neural networks
as most of the gas pressure is concentrated in a handful of voxels and even the
largest hydrodynamical simulations contain only a few hundred clusters that can
be used for training. Instead of conventional convolutional neural net (CNN)
architectures, we choose to employ a rotationally equivariant DeepSets
architecture to operate directly on the set of dark matter particles. We argue
that set-based architectures provide distinct advantages over CNNs. For
example, we can enforce exact rotational and permutation equivariance,
incorporate existing knowledge on the tSZ field, and work with sparse fields as
are standard in cosmology. We compose our architecture with separate,
physically meaningful modules, making it amenable to interpretation. For
example, we can separately study the influence of local and cluster-scale
environment, determine that cluster triaxiality has negligible impact, and
train a module that corrects for mis-centering. Our model improves by 70 % on
analytic profiles fit to the same simulation data. We argue that the electron
pressure field, viewed as a function of a gravity-only simulation, has inherent
stochasticity, and model this property through a conditional-VAE extension to
the network. This modification yields further improvement by 7 %, it is limited
by our small training set however. (abridged)

phase transitions in the pure state entanglement. In realistic settings,
however, this dynamics may be spoiled by decoherence, e.g., dephasing, due to
coupling to an environment or measurement imperfections. We investigate the
impact of dephasing and the inevitable evolution into a non-Gaussian, mixed
state, on the dynamics of monitored fermions. We approach it from three
complementary perspectives: (i) the exact solution of the conditional master
equation for small systems, (ii) quantum trajectory simulations of Gaussian
states for large systems, and (iii) a renormalization group analysis of a
bosonic replica field theory. For weak dephasing, constant monitoring preserves
a weakly mixed state, which displays a robust measurement-induced phase
transition between a critical and a pinned phase, as in the decoherence-free
case. At strong dephasing, we observe the emergence of a new scale describing
an effective temperature, which is accompanied with an increased mixedness of
the fermion density matrix. Remarkably, observables such as density-density
correlation functions or the subsystem parity still display scale invariant
behavior even in this strongly mixed phase. We interpret this as a signature of
gapless, classical diffusion, which is stabilized by the balanced interplay of
Hamiltonian dynamics, measurements, and decoherence.

indication that the Class 0/I/Flat Spectrum system may be difficult to tie
uniquely to the evolutionary state of protostars. When comparing with Class II
disk dust masses in Taurus from similar radiative transfer modeling, we further
find that the trend of disk dust mass decreasing from Class 0 to Class II disks

fair due to differences in star forming region and modeling techniques.

When $J_z$ is antiferromagnetic ($J_{z}>0$) and $J_x$ is ferromagnetic

which has power-law correlations at $T=0$. For $J_{z}<0$ and $J_{x}>0$,
spin-two excitations are found to have lower energy than spin-one at the
transition away from the fully polarized state, showing evidence for incipient
spin-nematic order. When both interactions are antiferromagnetic, we find a
non-degenerate ground state with no broken symmetries and a robust energy gap.
The low energy spectra evolve smoothly from predominantly Ising to
predominantly XY interactions. In the spin-liquid regime of small $|J_{x}|$, we
study the confinement of monopole-anti-monopole pairs and find that the
confinement length scale is larger for $J_x<0$ than for $J_{x}>0$, although

tides increases the number of BH-star mergers by up to 75 per cent but it does
not affect the number of BH-BH mergers. These results highlight the importance
of including orbital energy dissipation due to dynamical tides during few-body
encounters and evolution of close binary systems within stellar cluster
simulations. Consistent with previous studies, we find that the inclusion of PN
terms increases the number of BH-BH mergers during binary-single encounters.
However, BH-star mergers are largely unaffected by the inclusion of these

Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. Recent studies have shown that MFC can
well-approximate MARL when the population size is large and the agents are
exchangeable. Unfortunately, the presumption of exchangeability implies that
all agents uniformly interact with one another which is not true in many
practical scenarios. In this article, we relax the assumption of
exchangeability and model the interaction between agents via an arbitrary
doubly stochastic matrix. As a result, in our framework, the mean-field `seen'
by different agents are different. We prove that, if the reward of each agent
is an affine function of the mean-field seen by that agent, then one can
approximate such a non-uniform MARL problem via its associated MFC problem
within an error of $e=\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}[\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|} +
\sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}])$ where $N$ is the population size and $|\mathcal{X}|$,
$|\mathcal{U}|$ are the sizes of state and action spaces respectively. Finally,
we develop a Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithm that can provide a
solution to the non-uniform MARL with an error
$\mathcal{O}(\max\{e,\epsilon\})$ and a sample complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for any $\epsilon >0$.

angles of attack. The passive deployment of self-actuating covert feathers in
response to unsteady flow separation while performing such maneuvers provides a
passive flow control paradigm for these aerodynamic capabilities. Most studies
involving covert-feathers-inspired passive flow control have modeled the
feathers as a rigidly attached or a freely moving flap on a wing. A flap
mounted via a torsional spring enables a configuration more emblematic of the
finite stiffness associated with the covert-feather dynamics. The performance
benefits and flow physics associated with this more general case remain largely
unexplored. In this work, we model covert feathers as a passively deployable,
torsionally hinged flap on the suction surface of a stationary airfoil. We
numerically investigate this airfoil-flap system at a low Reynolds number of
$Re=1{,}000$ and angle of attack of $20^\circ$ by performing high-fidelity
nonlinear simulations using a projection-based immersed boundary method. A
parametric study performed by varying the stiffness of the spring, mass of the
flap and location of the hinge yielded lift improvements as high as 27%
relative to the baseline flap-less case and revealed two dominant flow
behavioral regimes. A detailed analysis revealed that the stiffness-dependent
mean flap deflection and inertia-dependent amplitude and phase of flap
oscillations altered the dominant flow characteristics in both the regimes. Of
special interest for performance benefits were the flap parameters that
enhanced the lift-conducive leading-edge vortex while weakening the
trailing-edge vortex and associated detrimental effect of upstream propagation
of reverse flow. These parameters also yielded a favorable temporal
synchronization of flap oscillations with the vortex-shedding process in both
regimes.

  Trainable with Low-Frequency Data","accepted to ICRA2022, added appendix",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.GR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tensegrity robots, composed of rigid rods and flexible cables, are difficult
to accurately model and control given the presence of complex dynamics and high
number of DoFs. Differentiable physics engines have been recently proposed as a
data-driven approach for model identification of such complex robotic systems.
These engines are often executed at a high-frequency to achieve accurate
simulation. Ground truth trajectories for training differentiable engines,
however, are not typically available at such high frequencies due to
limitations of real-world sensors. The present work focuses on this frequency
mismatch, which impacts the modeling accuracy. We proposed a recurrent
structure for a differentiable physics engine of tensegrity robots, which can
be trained effectively even with low-frequency trajectories. To train this new
recurrent engine in a robust way, this work introduces relative to prior work:
(i) a new implicit integration scheme, (ii) a progressive training pipeline,
and (iii) a differentiable collision checker. A model of NASA's icosahedron
SUPERballBot on MuJoCo is used as the ground truth system to collect training
data. Simulated experiments show that once the recurrent differentiable engine
has been trained given the low-frequency trajectories from MuJoCo, it is able
to match the behavior of MuJoCo's system. The criterion for success is whether
a locomotion strategy learned using the differentiable engine can be
transferred back to the ground-truth system and result in a similar motion.
Notably, the amount of ground truth data needed to train the differentiable
engine, such that the policy is transferable to the ground truth system, is 1%
of the data needed to train the policy directly on the ground-truth system.

kiloton) water and scintillator neutrino detectors.
  In parallel, the fundamental physics community has been developing detectors
at similar scales and with similar design features for a range of high-priority
physics topics, primarily in fundamental neutrino physics. These topics include
neutrino oscillation studies at beams and reactors, solar, and geological
neutrino measurements, supernova studies, and others.
  Examples of ongoing synergistic work at U.S. national laboratories and
universities include prototype gadolinium-doped water and water-based and
opaque scintillator test-beds and demonstrators, extensive testing and industry
partnerships related to large area fast position-sensitive photomultiplier
tubes, and the development of concepts for a possible underground kiloton-scale
water-based detector for reactor monitoring and technology demonstrations.

chance-constrained optimal power flow (CC-OPF) calculation, as a means to take

promoted. Compared to the local CC-OPF within a regional grid, the global
CC-OPF of a multi-regional interconnected grid is able to coordinate across
different regions and therefore improve the economic efficiency when
integrating high percentage of wind power generation. In this global problem,
however, multiple regional independent system operators (ISOs) participate in
the decision-making process, raising the need for distributed but coordinated
approaches. Most notably, due to regulation restrictions, commercial interest,
and data security, regional ISOs may refuse to share confidential information
with others, including generation cost, load data, system topologies, and line

regional ISOs to determine the optimal dispatchable generations within their
regions without disclosing confidential data. This method does not require
parameter tunings and will not suffer from convergence challenges. Results from
IEEE test cases show that this method is highly accurate.

ensembles of Pd-Zn atoms as a function of composition and temperature.
Combining the present extensive first-principles calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) and available experimental data, the Pd-Zn system was
remodeled using the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) approach. High
throughput modeling tools with uncertainty quantification, i.e., ESPEI and
PyCalphad, were incorporated in the phase analysis. The site occupancies across
the {\gamma}-phase composition region were given special attention. A
four-sublattice model was used for the {\gamma}-phase owing to its four Wyckoff

occupancy preference of Pd in the OT and OH sublattices in agreement with
experimental observations. The force constants obtained from DFT-based phonon
calculations further supports the tendency of Pd occupying the OH sublattice
compared with the IT and CO sublattice. The catalytic assembles changing from
Pd monomers (Pd1) to trimers (Pd3) on the surface of the {\gamma}-phase is
attributed to the increase of Pd occupancy in the OH sublattice.

of available methods, existing PLF approaches rarely take system control into
account. However, system control, as an automatic buffer between the
fluctuations in random variables and the variations in system states, has a
significant impact on the final PLF result. To consider control actions'
influence, this paper proposes the first analytical PLF method for the
transmission grid that takes into account primary and secondary frequency
controls. This method is based on a high-precision linear power flow model,
whose precision is even further improved in this paper by an original
correction approach. This paper also proves that if the joint probability
distribution (JPD) of random variables is expressed by a Gaussian mixture model
(GMM), then the JPD of system states (e.g., nodal voltages) is an infinite GMM.
By leveraging this proposition, the proposed method can generate the joint PLF

set of images of a scene with sensor poses and calibrations and estimates a
photo-real digital model. One of the key innovations is that the underlying
volumetric representation is completely explicit in contrast to neural
network-based (implicit) alternatives. We encode scenes explicitly using clear
and understandable mappings of optimization variables to scene geometry and
their outgoing surface radiance. We represent them using hierarchical
volumetric fields stored in a sparse voxel octree. Robustly reconstructing such
a volumetric scene model with millions of unknown variables from registered
scene images only is a highly non-convex and complex optimization problem. To
this end, we employ stochastic gradient descent (Adam) which is steered by an
inverse differentiable renderer.
  We demonstrate that our method can reconstruct models of high quality that
are comparable to state-of-the-art implicit methods. Importantly, we do not use
a sequential reconstruction pipeline where individual steps suffer from
incomplete or unreliable information from previous stages, but start our
optimizations from uniformed initial solutions with scene geometry and radiance
that is far off from the ground truth. We show that our method is general and
practical. It does not require a highly controlled lab setup for capturing, but
allows for reconstructing scenes with a vast variety of objects, including
challenging ones, such as outdoor plants or furry toys. Finally, our
reconstructed scene models are versatile thanks to their explicit design. They
can be edited interactively which is computationally too costly for implicit
alternatives.

Contrary to our expectations, results show that in many cases out-of-domain

Confounding adjustment when studying the effects of DDIs can be accomplished
via inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), a standard approach
originally developed for binary treatments and later generalized to
multi-valued treatments. However, this approach generally results in biased
results when the propensity score model is misspecified. Motivated by the need

properties in 2D Heisenberg models with spin and spatial anisotropies. We have
measured the magnetic excitations at zero field and in fields up to 5 T,
finding a complex mode structure with multiple characteristic features that
allow us to extract all the relevant magnetic interactions by modelling within
the linear spin-wave approximation. We demonstrate that
Ba(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$ is a checkerboard system with almost equal intra- and
inter-plaquette couplings, in which the intra-plaquette DM interaction is
instrumental both in enforcing robust magnetic order and in opening a large gap

generalized phase diagrams for spin-1/2 square-lattice models and materials,

optimal transport based graph matching (OT-GM) method for 3D mouse OCT image
registration. We first perform registration of fundus-like images obtained by
projecting all b-scans of a volume on a plane orthogonal to them, hereafter
referred to as the x-y plane. We introduce Adaptive Weighted Vessel Graph
Descriptors (AWVGD) and 3D Cube Descriptors (CD) to identify the correspondence
between nodes of graphs extracted from segmented vessels within the OCT
projection images. The AWVGD comprises scaling, translation and rotation, which
are computationally efficient, whereas CD exploits 3D spatial and frequency
domain information. The OT-GM method subsequently performs the correct
alignment in the x-y plane. Finally, registration along the direction
orthogonal to the x-y plane (the z-direction) is guided by the segmentation of
two important anatomical features peculiar to mouse b-scans, the Internal
Limiting Membrane (ILM) and the hyaloid remnant (HR). Both subjective and
objective evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other
well-established methods on mouse OCT images within a reasonable execution

spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling, where the dust attenuation
properties are modeled simultaneously with other galaxy physical properties. In
this paper, we assess the ability of SED modeling to infer these dust
attenuation curves from broadband photometry, and suggest a new flexible model
that greatly improves the accuracy of attenuation curve derivations. To do
this, we fit mock SEDs generated from the Simba cosmological simulation with
the Prospector SED fitting code. We consider the impact of the commonly-assumed
uniform screen model and introduce a new non-uniform screen model parameterized
by the fraction of unobscured stellar light. This non-uniform screen model
allows for a non-zero fraction of stellar light to remain unattenuated,
resulting in a more flexible attenuation curve shape by decoupling the shape of
the UV attenuation curve from the optical attenuation curve. The ability to
constrain the dust attenuation curve is significantly improved with the use of
a non-uniform screen model, with the median offset in UV attenuation decreasing
from $-0.30$ dex with a uniform screen model to $-0.17$ dex with the
non-uniform screen model. With this increase in dust attenuation modeling
accuracy, we also improve the star formation rates (SFRs) inferred with the
non-uniform screen model, decreasing the SFR offset on average by $0.12$ dex.
We discuss the efficacy of this new model, focusing on caveats with modeling
star-dust geometries and the constraining power of available SED observations.

passing them through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we
show that converting depth maps into pseudo-LiDAR signals, previously shown to
be useful for 3D object detection, is a better representation for camera
localization tasks by projecting point clouds that can accurately determine
6DOF camera pose. This is demonstrated by first comparing localization
accuracies of a network operating exclusively on pseudo-LiDAR representations,
with networks operating exclusively on depth maps. We then propose FusionLoc, a
novel architecture that uses pseudo-LiDAR to regress a 6DOF camera pose.
FusionLoc is a dual stream neural network, which aims to remedy common issues

FusionLoc performs better than a number of other camera localization methods,

conditions, the optimal energy usage strategy for lap time minimisation is
typically computed through a constrained optimisation problem. To the best of
our knowledge, the majority of state-of-the-art works neglects competitors.
This leads to a mismatch with the real world, where traffic generates
considerable time losses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new framework to
offline compute optimal strategies for the powertrain energy management
considering competitors. Through analysis of the available data from previous
events, statistics on the sector times and overtaking probabilities are
extracted to encode the competitors' behaviour. Adopting a multi-agent model,
the statistics are then used to generate realistic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation

the optimal strategy as follows. We develop a longitudinal vehicle model for
the ego-vehicle and implement an optimisation problem for lap time minimisation
in absence of traffic, based on Genetic Algorithms. Solving the optimisation
problem for a variety of constraints generates a set of candidate optimal
strategies. Stochastic Dynamic Programming is finally implemented to choose the
best strategy considering competitors, whose motion is generated by the MC

multiagent system (MAS). Enacting a protocol presupposes that agents are bound
to the its roles. Existing protocol-based approaches, however, do not
adequately treat the practical aspects of how roles bindings come about.
  Pippi addresses this problem of MAS instantiation. It proposes the notion of
a metaprotocol, enacting which instantiates a MAS suitable for enacting a given
protocol. Pippi demonstrates the subtleties involved in instantiating MAS
arising from protocol composition, correlation, and decentralization. To
address these subtleties and further support practical application patterns, we
introduce an enhanced protocol language, with support for parameter types
(including role and protocol typed parameters, for metaprotocols), interface
flexibility, and binding constraints. We discuss the realization of our
approach through an extended agent architecture, including the novel concept of
a MAS adapter for contact management. We evaluate Pippi's expressiveness by
demonstrating common patterns for agent discovery.

(ML) for this purpose has been growing over the last few years, primarily due
to the availability of large-scale galactic surveys. However, due to
observational errors, a significant fraction of these data sets often have
missing entries, rendering that fraction unusable for ML regression
applications. In this study, we demonstrate the performance of an imputation
technique called Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), which
rectifies the issue of missing data entries by imputing them using the
available information in the catalog. We use the Fermi-LAT Fourth Data Release

methodology described in Dainotti et al. (2021) and create an ML model for
estimating the redshift of 4LAC AGNs. We present results which highlight
positive impact of MICE imputation technique on the machine learning models

purely data-based fashion and for linear single-input and single-output
systems, both robustly stable and performing control systems for tracking
piecewise constant reference signals. The approach uses both (i) Virtual
Reference Feedback Tuning for enforcing suitable performances and (ii) the Set
Membership framework for providing a-priori robust stability guarantees.
Indeed, an uncertainty set for the system parameters is obtained through Set
Membership identification, where an algorithm based on the scenario approach is
proposed to estimate the inflation parameter in a probabilistic way. Based on
this set, robust stability conditions are enforced as Linear Matrix Inequality
constraints within an optimization problem whose linear cost function relies on
Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning. To show the generality and effectiveness of
our approach, we apply it to two of the most widely used yet simple control
schemes, i.e., where tracking is achieved thanks to (i) a static feedforward
action and (ii) an integrator in closed-loop. The proposed method is not fully
direct due to the Set Membership identification. However, the uncertainty set
is used with the only objective of providing robust stability guarantees for
the closed-loop system and it is not directly used for the performances
optimization, which instead is totally based on data. The effectiveness of the
developed method is demonstrated with reference to two simulation examples. A
comparison with other data-driven methods is also carried out.

various existing neural network optimizers as approximate stochastic proximal
point methods which trade off the current-batch loss with proximity terms in
both function space and weight space. The idea behind APO is to amortize the
minimization of the proximal point objective by meta-learning the parameters of
an update rule. We show how APO can be used to adapt a learning rate or a
structured preconditioning matrix. Under appropriate assumptions, APO can
recover existing optimizers such as natural gradient descent and KFAC. It
enjoys low computational overhead and avoids expensive and numerically
sensitive operations required by some second-order optimizers, such as matrix
inverses. We empirically test APO for online adaptation of learning rates and
structured preconditioning matrices for regression, image reconstruction, image
classification, and natural language translation tasks. Empirically, the
learning rate schedules found by APO generally outperform optimal fixed
learning rates and are competitive with manually tuned decay schedules. Using
APO to adapt a structured preconditioning matrix generally results in
optimization performance competitive with second-order methods. Moreover, the
absence of matrix inversion provides numerical stability, making it effective
for low precision training.

probability of return for the departing customer but at a cost that is convex
increasing in the amount of reduction in the return probability. Other costs
are incurred as customers wait in the queue and every time they return for
service. Our primary motivation comes from post-discharge Quality Improvement
(QI) interventions (e.g., follow up phone-calls, appointments) frequently used
in a variety of healthcare settings to reduce unplanned hospital readmissions.
Our objective is to understand how the cost of interventions should be balanced
with the reductions in congestion and service costs. To this end, we consider a
fluid approximation of the queueing system and characterize the structure of
optimal long-run average and bias-optimal transient control policies for the
fluid model. Our structural results motivate the design of intuitive surge
protocols whereby different intensities of interventions (corresponding to
different levels of reduction in the return probability) are provided based on
the congestion in the system. Through extensive simulation experiments, we
study the performance of the fluid policy for the stochastic system and
identify parameter regimes where it leads to significant cost savings compared
to a fixed long-run average optimal policy that ignores holding costs and a
simple policy that uses the highest level of intervention whenever the queue is
non-empty. In particular, we find that in a parameter regime relevant to our
motivating application, dynamically adjusting the intensity of interventions
could result in up to 25.4% reduction in long-run average cost and 33.7% in
finite-horizon costs compared to the simple aggressive policy.

for significant improvements of some already-existing results by relaxing

generate long-range quantum entanglement, a property of topological matter.
Another approach to strong non-local correlations employs the macroscopic
coherence of superconductors. Impurity spins in superconductors are thought to
be unamenable to the formation of long-range spin entanglement because each
spin tends to be screened by binding to a quasiparticle from the superconductor
to form a local singlet. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to attach a
second quasiparticle to the spin, overscreening it into a doublet state
carrying ferromagnetic correlations between two quasiparticles over a
micrometer distance. To demonstrate this effect, which is strongest for equal
binding, we symmetrically couple the spin of a quantum dot to two ultrasmall
superconducting islands. The overscreened state requires sufficiently large
Coulomb repulsion and exchange binding to become well defined. We predict that
this state will carry long-range correlations for an alternating chain of
quantum dots and superconducting islands, opening a new route to controllable
large-scale entanglement in the solid state.

proposed in [1,2] are non-circular. This particular deviation from circularity
can result in cusps, a dent and an asymmetry in the photon rings surrounding
the black-hole shadow. Finally, we explore a new class of non-circular
deviations from Kerr black holes, which promote the spin parameter to a
function, and find indications that regularity cannot be achieved in this
setting. This result strengthens the case for regular black holes based on a
promotion of the mass parameter to a function.

In total, the wave functions of more than 10,000 intermediate $1^+$ states in
$^{76}$As were calculated in a three-step procedure allowing an efficient use

The wave functions of the rest of the states, up to some 30 MeV, were computed

computed magnitudes of the $2\nu\beta\beta$ nuclear matrix elements (including
the value of the axial-vector coupling $g_{\rm A}$), $\vert M_{2\nu}\vert

used to derive the value $g_{\rm A}=0.80\pm0.01$ for the axial-vector coupling,

with objects lead to our excellent perception of moving objects. The human
ability to detect and segment moving objects works in the presence of multiple
objects, complex background geometry, motion of the observer and even
camouflage. How humans perceive moving objects so reliably is a longstanding
research question in computer vision and borrows findings from related areas
such as psychology, cognitive science and physics. One approach to the problem
is to teach a deep network to model all of these effects. This contrasts with
the strategy used by human vision, where cognitive processes and body design
are tightly coupled and each is responsible for certain aspects of correctly
identifying moving objects. Similarly from the computer vision perspective,
there is evidence that classical, geometry-based techniques are better suited
to the ""motion-based"" parts of the problem, while deep networks are more
suitable for modeling appearance. In this work, we argue that the coupling of
camera rotation and camera translation can create complex motion fields that
are difficult for a deep network to untangle directly. We present a novel
probabilistic model to estimate the camera's rotation given the motion field.
We then rectify the flow field to obtain a rotation-compensated motion field
for subsequent segmentation. This strategy of first estimating camera motion,
and then allowing a network to learn the remaining parts of the problem, yields
improved results on the widely used DAVIS benchmark as well as the recently
published motion segmentation data set MoCA (Moving Camouflaged Animals).

problem whose viable solutions are usually found by heuristic algorithms.
Considering the increasing need of improvement on logistics, the use of robots
for increasing the efficiency of logistics warehouses is becoming a
requirement. In a smart warehouse the main tasks consist of employing a fleet
of automated picking and mobile robots that coordinate by picking up items from
a set of orders from the shelves and dropping them at the delivery stations.
Two aspects generally justify multi-robot task allocation complexity: (i)
environmental aspects, such as multi-delivery stations and dispersed robots
(since they remain in constant motion) and (ii) fleet heterogeneity, where
robots' traffic speed and capacity loads are different from each other. Despite
these properties have been widely researched in the literature, they usually
are investigated separately. This work proposes a scalable and efficient task
allocation algorithm for smart warehouses with multi-delivery stations and
heterogeneous fleets. Our strategy employs a novel cost estimator, which
computes costs as a function of the robots' variable characteristics and
capacity while they receive new tasks. For validating the strategy a series of
experiments is performed simulating the operation of smart warehouses with
multiple delivery stations and heteregenous fleets. The results show that our
strategy generates routes costing up to $33$\% less than the routes generated
by a state-of-the-art task allocation algorithm and $96$\% faster in test
instances representing our target scenario. Considering single-delivery
stations and non-dispersed robots, we reduced the number of robots by up to
$18$\%, allocating tasks $92$\% faster, and generating routes whose costs are
statistically similar to the routes generated by the state-of-the-art

improve. For example, people wishing to get a loan may be able to take some
actions that increase their perceived credit-worthiness and others that also
increase their true credit-worthiness. A decision-maker would like to define a
classification rule with few false-positives (does not give out many bad loans)
while yielding many true positives (giving out many good loans), which includes
encouraging agents to improve to become true positives if possible. We consider
two models for this problem, a general discrete model and a linear model, and
prove algorithmic, learning, and hardness results for each. For the general
discrete model, we give an efficient algorithm for the problem of maximizing
the number of true positives subject to no false positives, and show how to
extend this to a partial-information learning setting. We also show hardness
for the problem of maximizing the number of true positives subject to a nonzero
bound on the number of false positives, and that this hardness holds even for a
finite-point version of our linear model. We also show that maximizing the
number of true positives subject to no false positive is NP-hard in our full
linear model. We additionally provide an algorithm that determines whether
there exists a linear classifier that classifies all agents accurately and
causes all improvable agents to become qualified, and give additional results
for low-dimensional data.

goals. Given a set of target skill levels, we assume each agent will try to
improve from their initial skill level to the closest target level within reach
or do nothing if no target level is within reach. We consider two models: the
common improvement capacity model, where agents have the same limit on how much
they can improve, and the individualized improvement capacity model, where
agents have individualized limits. Our goal is to optimize the target levels
for social welfare and fairness objectives, where social welfare is defined as
the total amount of improvement, and fairness objectives are considered where
the agents belong to different underlying populations. A key technical
challenge of this problem is the non-monotonicity of social welfare in the set
of target levels, i.e., adding a new target level may decrease the total amount
of improvement as it may get easier for some agents to improve. This is
especially challenging when considering multiple groups because optimizing
target levels in isolation for each group and outputting the union may result
in arbitrarily low improvement for a group, failing the fairness objective.
Considering these properties, we provide algorithms for optimal and
near-optimal improvement for both social welfare and fairness objectives. These
algorithmic results work for both the common and individualized improvement
capacity models. Furthermore, we show a placement of target levels exists that
is approximately optimal for the social welfare of each group. Unlike the
algorithmic results, this structural statement only holds in the common
improvement capacity model, and we show counterexamples in the individualized
improvement capacity model. Finally, we extend our algorithms to learning
settings where we have only sample access to the initial skill levels of

capitalizes on the carrier-phase fixed-ambiguity residual cost produced by a

tightly coupled with a low-cost IMU. The carrier-phase fixed-ambiguity residual
cost is sensitive at the sub-centimeter-level to discrepancies between measured
carrier phase values and the values predicted by prior measurements and by the

Such discrepancies will arise in a spoofing attack due to the attacker's
practical inability to predict the centimeter-amplitude vehicle movement caused
by roadway irregularities. The effectiveness of the developed spoofing
detection method is evaluated with data captured by a vehicle-mounted sensor

is based on a repeated application of the functional relations proposed by the
author. Explicit formulae are given for reducing one-loop scalar integrals to a
simpler ones, the arguments of which are the ratios of polynomials in the
masses and kinematic invariants. We show that a general scalar $n$-point
integral, depending on $n(n+1)/2$ generic masses and kinematic variables, can
be expressed as a linear combination of integrals depending only on $n$
variables. The latter integrals are given explicitly in terms of hypergeometric
functions of $(n-1)$ dimensionless variables. Analytic expressions for the 2-,
3- and 4-point integrals, that depend on the minimal number of variables, were
also obtained by solving the dimensional recurrence relations. The resulting
expressions for these integrals are given in terms of Gauss' hypergeometric
function $_2F_1$, the Appell function $F_1$ and the hypergeometric Lauricella -
Saran function $F_S$. A modification of the functional reduction procedure for
some special values of kinematical variables is considered.

Analysis to evaluate how good a prediction model is. This paper proposes a
decomposition of the C-Index into a weighted harmonic mean of two quantities:
one for ranking observed events versus other observed events, and the other for
ranking observed events versus censored cases. This decomposition allows a more
fine-grained analysis of the pros and cons of survival prediction methods. The
utility of the decomposition is demonstrated using three benchmark survival
analysis models (Cox Proportional Hazard, Random Survival Forest, and Deep
Adversarial Time-to-Event Network) together with a new variational generative
neural-network-based method (SurVED), which is also proposed in this paper. The
demonstration is done on four publicly available datasets with varying
censoring levels. The analysis with the C-index decomposition shows that all
methods essentially perform equally well when the censoring level is high
because of the dominance of the term measuring the ranking of events versus
censored cases. In contrast, some methods deteriorate when the censoring level
decreases because they do not rank the events versus other events well.

capable of finding approximate solutions to problems posed with little more
constraints than a suitably-posed mathematical system and an objective
function. Consequently, DNNs have considerably more flexibility in applications
than classical numerical methods. On the other hand they offer an uncontrolled
approximation to the sought-after mathematical solution. This suggests that
hybridization of classical numerical methods with DNN-based approximations may
be a desirable approach. In this work a DNN-based approximator inspired by the
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) methodology is used to provide an
initial guess to a Newton's method iteration of a very-high order implicit
Runge-Kutta (IRK) integration of a nonlinear system of ODEs, namely the Lorenz

guess to the implicit system's nonlinear solver, requiring enough work to make
the IRK method infeasible. The DNN-based approach described in this work
enables large implicit time-steps to be taken to any desired degree of accuracy
for as much effort as it takes to converge the DNN solution to within a few

matter physics in colloidal suspensions have reported normal diffusion with a
Laplacian probability distribution in the particles displacements (i.e.,
Brownian yet non Gaussian diffusion). To model this behavior different
stochastic models had been proposed, with all of them introducing new random
elements that incorporate our lack of information about the media. Although
these models work in practice, due to their own nature a thorough understanding
of how the media interacts with itself and with the Brownian particle in
Brownian yet non Gaussian diffusion is outside of their aim and scope. For this
reason, a comprehensive mathematical model to explain Brownian yet non Gaussian
diffusion that includes molecular interactions is proposed in this paper. Based
on the theory of interfaces by Gennes and Langevin dynamics, it is shown that
long-range interactions in a weakly interacting fluid and in a microscopic
regime of zero viscosity leads to a Laplacian probability distribution in the
particles displacements. Further, it is shown that a phase transition can
explain a high diffusivity and causes this Laplacian distribution to evolve
towards a Gaussian via a transition probability in the interval of time as it
was observed in experiments. To validate these model predictions, the
experimental data of the Brownian motion of colloidal beads on phospholipid
bilayer by Wang et al. is used and compared with the results of the theory.
This comparison suggests that the proposed model not only is able to explain
qualitatively the Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion, but also quantitatively.

networks (OWSNs) can offer lower latency than optical fiber terrestrial
networks (OFTNs). However, when is it beneficial to switch or crossover from an
OFTN to an OWSN for lower latency data communications? In this work, we
introduce a crossover function that enables to find the crossover distance,
i.e., a distance between two points on the surface of the Earth beyond which
switching or crossing over from an OFTN to an OWSN for data communications
between these points is useful in terms of latency. Numerical results reveal
that a higher refractive index of optical fiber (or $i$) in an OFTN and a lower
altitude of satellites (or $h$) in an OWSN result in a shorter crossover
distance. To account for the variation in the end-to-end propagation distance
that occurs over the OWSN, we examine the crossover function in four different
scenarios. Numerical results indicate that the crossover distance varies with
the end-to-end propagation distance over an OWSN and is different for different
scenarios. We calculate the average crossover distance over all scenarios for
different $h$ and $i$ and use it to evaluate the simulation results.
Furthermore, for a comparative analysis of OFTNs and OWSNs in terms of latency,
we study three different OFTNs having different refractive indices and three
different OWSNs having different satellite altitudes in three different
scenarios for long-distance inter-continental data communications, including
connections between New York and Dublin, Sao Paulo and London, and Toronto and
Sydney.

smoothing was recently introduced as a means to alleviate the curse of
dimensionality, giving rise to a parametric convergence rate in any dimension,
while preserving the Wasserstein metric and topological structure. To
facilitate valid statistical inference, in this work, we develop a
comprehensive limit distribution theory for the empirical smooth Wasserstein

after embedding the domain of the Wasserstein distance into a certain dual
Sobolev space, characterizing its Hadamard directional derivative for the dual
Sobolev norm, and establishing weak convergence of the smooth empirical process
in the dual space. To estimate the distributional limits, we also establish
consistency of the nonparametric bootstrap. Finally, we use the limit

distance estimation with the smooth Wasserstein distance, showing asymptotic

the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) via phase I clinical trials. Generally
speaking, phase I trial designs can be classified as either model-based or
algorithm-based approaches. Model-based phase I designs are typically more
efficient by using all observed data, while there is a potential risk of model
misspecification that may lead to unreliable dose assignment and incorrect MTD
identification. In contrast, most of the algorithm-based designs are less
efficient in using cumulative information, because they tend to focus on the
observed data in the neighborhood of the current dose level for dose movement.
To use the data more efficiently yet without any model assumption, we propose a
novel approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach for phase I trial design.
Not only is the ABC design free of any dose--toxicity curve assumption, but it
can also aggregate all the available information accrued in the trial for dose
assignment. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate its robustness and
efficiency compared with other phase I designs. We apply the ABC design to the
MEK inhibitor selumetinib trial to demonstrate its satisfactory performance.
The proposed design can be a useful addition to the family of phase I clinical

parameterized upper and lower approximations of the indicator function in the

convexification of nonconvexity and nondifferentiability via surrogation. The

poorly constrained by experimental data. Since it is chiral-odd, it can only be
accessed through channels that couple to other chiral-odd distributions, like
the Collins fragmentation functions (so-called Collins effect) or the
interference fragmentation functions. Recently, a detailed calculation using
the soft-collinear effective theory found that the Collins effect in $pp$
collisions involves a mixture of collinear and transverse momentum dependent
(TMD) factorization. The Collins effect provides a direct probe to the Collins
fragmentation function and enables testing of its evolution, universality and
factorization breaking in the transverse momentum dependent formalism. In 2018,
STAR published the first measurements of Collins asymmetries for charged pions
in jets in polarized $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV based on data

value in quantum information processing. The existing quantum control methods
treat the generation of the maximally entangled state (MES) as a problem of
state transfer by specifying the desired MES as the target state. Current
methods suffer from two major deficiencies: the structure of the MES to be
prepared must be known in advance, and the quantum control can only be designed
for one MES at a time, and when the target MES changes, the quantum control
must be redesigned. In order to solve these two deficiencies, this paper
proposes an improved quantum Lyapunov control method, in which the
establishment of the Lyapunov function is based on the measure of quantum
entanglement rather than the distance between two quantum states. This
innovative approach allows us to prepare all MESs, whether their structures are
known or unknown in advance, through a single control design. Since the control
target is the scalar entanglement measure, not the quantum state vector, the
entanglement control strategy proposed in this paper is not influenced by the
number of entangled particles. The proposed method will be applied to bipartite
pure states first to show that all Bell states and their equivalent states can
be prepared through one control design. Secondly, it is applied to bipartite
mixed states and multipartite states to show that this method has the ability
to generate currently unknown MESs.

that the popular chain-ladder reserving approach is at significant risk to such
aberrant observations in that reserve estimates can be significantly shifted in
the presence of even one outlier. As a consequence the chain-ladder reserving
technique is non-robust. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of
reserves and mean squared errors of prediction under Mack's Model (Mack, 1993).
This is done through the derivation of impact functions which are calculated by
taking the first derivative of the relevant statistic of interest with respect
to an observation. We also provide and discuss the impact functions for
quantiles when total reserves are assumed to be lognormally distributed.
Additionally, comparisons are made between the impact functions for individual
accident year reserves under Mack's Model and the Bornhuetter-Ferguson
methodology. It is shown that the impact of incremental claims on these
statistics of interest varies widely throughout a loss triangle and is heavily
dependent on other cells in the triangle.
  Results are illustrated using data from a Belgian non-life insurer.

structure, contributing to the total SMD, is the disk, and holds a fairly
constant share of $\sim60\%$ of the total SMD from $z = 0.8$ to $z = 0.2$,
dropping to $\sim30\%$ at $z = 0.0$ (representing $\sim33\%$ decline in the
total disk SMD). Other classes (E, dB, and cB) show steady growth in their
numbers and integrated stellar mass densities. By number, the most dramatic
change across the full mass range is in the growth of diffuse bulges. In terms

rising from 20\% at $z = 0.8$ to equal that of disks at $z = 0.0$ (30\%)

be similar. This is distinct from the general unsupervised contrastive learning
that assumes an image and its augmentations share a similar representation.
Specifically, relation graphs are constructed using the nearest neighbours to
identify existing similar samples, then the constructed inter-instance relation
graphs are transferred to the missing views to build graphs on the
corresponding missing data. Subsequently, two main components, within-view
graph contrastive learning (WGC) and cross-view graph consistency learning
(CGC), are devised to maximize the mutual information of different views within
a cluster. The proposed approach elevates instance-level contrastive learning

discriminative visual features due to poor lighting. In this paper, we present
a novel multimodal person detection architecture to address the mobile robot

training approach using 1) a unique pretraining method we define as Temporal
Invariant Multimodal Contrastive Learning (TimCLR), and 2) a Multimodal Faster
R-CNN (MFRCNN) detector. TimCLR learns person representations that are
invariant under intraclass variations through unsupervised learning. Our
approach is unique in that it generates image pairs from natural variations
within multimodal image sequences, in addition to synthetic data augmentation,
and contrasts crossmodal features to transfer invariances between different
modalities. These pretrained features are used by the MFRCNN detector for
finetuning and person detection from RGB-D images. Extensive experiments
validate the performance of our DL architecture in both human-centered crowded

the three-port AC/DC admittance model of VSCs is established, and the

methods are presented: the one is based on the system open-loop model, where
the stability can be judged via the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC); the
other one is based on the system closed-loop model, whose stability can be

bounds of the prepared entangled states follow the Heisenberg-limited scalings.
These states can also be used as the input states for Ramsey interferometry and
the final measurement precisions still follow the Heisenberg-limited scalings.
While the pulse train along only one axis is more simple and efficient, the
scheme using pulse sequence along two orthogonal axes show better robustness
against atom number deviation. Our protocol with DRL is efficient and easy to

with an outstanding success in image recognition applications, such as material

rely on the abundance of labelled observations to train a prospective model.
These models are composed of millions of parameters to estimate, increasing the
need of more training observations. Frequently it is expensive to gather
labelled observations of data, making the usage of deep learning models not
ideal, as the model might over-fit data. In a semi-supervised setting,
unlabelled data is used to improve the levels of accuracy and generalization of
a model with small labelled datasets. Nevertheless, in many situations
different unlabelled data sources might be available. This raises the risk of a
significant distribution mismatch between the labelled and unlabelled datasets.
Such phenomena can cause a considerable performance hit to typical
semi-supervised deep learning frameworks, which often assume that both labelled

this paper we study the latest approaches for semi-supervised deep learning for
image recognition. Emphasis is made in semi-supervised deep learning models

critical given the increasing demand for practical applications including

impact on other behavior, causing regressions, i.e., the updated DNN fails with
inputs correctly handled by the original one. This problem is crucial when
engineers are required to investigate failures in intensive assurance
activities for safety or trust. Search-based repair techniques for DNNs have
potentials to tackle this challenge by enabling localized updates only on

proposed a novel layer-adaptive OOD detection framework (LA-OOD) for DNNs that
can fully utilize the intermediate layers' outputs. Specifically, instead of
training a unified OOD detector at a fixed ending layer, we train multiple
One-Class SVM OOD detectors simultaneously at the intermediate layers to
exploit the full spectrum characteristics encoded at varying depths of DNNs. We
develop a simple yet effective layer-adaptive policy to identify the best layer
for detecting each potential OOD example. LA-OOD can be applied to any existing
DNNs and does not require access to OOD samples during the training. Using

significant improvement over the $ O(n+k^2)$ computation cost that is achieved
by the recent PI-RAPPOR algorithm (Feldman and Talwar; 2021). Our empirical
evaluation shows a speedup of over 50x over PI-RAPPOR while using approximately
75x less memory for practically relevant parameter settings. In addition, the

improve the quality for NMT, which seeks for a consensus translation that is
closest on average to other candidates from the n-best list. We argue that MBR
still suffers from the following problems: The utility function only considers
the lexical-level similarity between candidates; The expected utility considers
the entire n-best list which is time-consuming and inadequate candidates in the

blocks for learning models which aim to capture the intrinsic structure of
statistical populations of positive-definite matrices (here called covariance
matrices). While the potential applications of such models have attracted
significant attention, a major obstacle still stands in the way of these
applications: there seems to exist no practical method of computing the
normalising factors associated with Riemannian Gaussian distributions on spaces
of high-dimensional covariance matrices. The present paper shows that this
missing method comes from an unexpected new connection with random matrix
theory. Its main contribution is to prove that Riemannian Gaussian
distributions of real, complex, or quaternion covariance matrices are
equivalent to orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic log-normal matrix ensembles.
This equivalence yields a highly efficient approximation of the normalising
factors, in terms of a rather simple analytic expression. The error due to this
approximation decreases like the inverse square of dimension. Numerical
experiments are conducted which demonstrate how this new approximation can
unlock the difficulties which have impeded applications to real-world datasets
of high-dimensional covariance matrices. The paper then turns to Riemannian
Gaussian distributions of block-Toeplitz covariance matrices. These are
equivalent to yet another kind of random matrix ensembles, here called
""acosh-normal"" ensembles. Orthogonal and unitary ""acosh-normal"" ensembles
correspond to the cases of block-Toeplitz with Toeplitz blocks, and
block-Toeplitz (with general blocks) covariance matrices, respectively.

safe autonomous driving system. However, deep learning models for 3D semantic
segmentation often suffer from the class imbalance problem and
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this study, we explore how the class
imbalance problem affects 3DSS performance and whether the model can detect the
category prediction correctness, or whether data is ID (in-distribution) or
OOD. For these purposes, we conduct two experiments using three representative
3DSS models and five trust scoring methods, and conduct both a confusion and
feature analysis of each class. Furthermore, a data augmentation method for the
3D LiDAR dataset is proposed to create a new dataset based on SemanticKITTI and
SemanticPOSS, called AugKITTI. We propose the wPre metric and TSD for a more
in-depth analysis of the results, and follow are proposals with an insightful
discussion. Based on the experimental results, we find that: (1) the classes
are not only imbalanced in their data size but also in the basic properties of
each semantic category. (2) The intraclass diversity and interclass ambiguity
make class learning difficult and greatly limit the models' performance,
creating the challenges of semantic and data gaps. (3) The trust scores are
unreliable for classes whose features are confused with other classes. For 3DSS
models, those misclassified ID classes and OODs may also be given high trust
scores, making the 3DSS predictions unreliable, and leading to the challenges
in judging 3DSS result trustworthiness. All of these outcomes point to several
research directions for improving the performance and reliability of the 3DSS
models used for real-world applications.

  In this paper, we use the recently developed Instruction-Level Abstraction
(ILA) for accelerators to serve this purpose, similar to how the Instruction
Set Architecture (ISA) has been used as the software/hardware interface for

prototype compiles programs from high-level domain-specific languages, e.g.,
PyTorch and MxNet, to multiple target accelerators with no target-specific
extensions to the application or compiler - thus demonstrating application
portability. It includes compiler optimizations through instruction selection
using equality saturation-based flexible matching. Finally, we show checking
the correctness of the resulting code through formal verification of individual
matched operations and fully automated simulation-based validation of complete
applications. The evaluation of the prototype compiler is based on six
different DL applications and three different accelerators. Overall, this

of a control centre and multiple retailers by enabling multiple REPs to build a

critical issues such as data privacy, data security and scalability. For
forecasting, we use a state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural

promises of higher accuracy with time-series data while solving the vanishing

to be a complete cessation of accretion, a phenomenon that has been observed
only once before in an intermediate polar. Simultaneous ground-based
observations of this faint state establish that when accretion is negligible,
YY Dra fades to $g=17.37\pm0.12$, which we infer to be the magnitude of the
combined photospheric contributions of the white dwarf and its red dwarf
companion. Using survey photometry, we identify additional low states in
2018-2019 during which YY Dra repeatedly fades to -- but never below -- this
threshold. This implies relatively frequent cessations in accretion.
Spectroscopic observations during future episodes of negligible accretion can
be used to directly measure the field strength of the white dwarf by Zeeman
splitting. Separately, we search newly available catalogs of variable stars in
an attempt to resolve the long-standing dispute over the proper identifier of
this system.

present our selection criteria, which is based on an implementation of the
Earth Similarity Index, as well as the results of an initial investigation into
the desiccation of the targets, which reveals that TOI 203 b is almost
certainly desiccated based on TESS observations. We then describe the
characterization of the remaining targets and their host stars from 2MASS,
Gaia, and TESS data and the derivation of sampled probability distributions for
their parameters. Following this, we describe our process of simulating the
desiccation of the targets hydrospheres using the Virtual Planet Simulator,
VPLanet, with inputs directly linked to the previously derived probability
distributions. We find that 50.86 percent of the likely cases for TOI 700 d are
desiccated and no modeled cases for TOI 256 b are without water. In addition,
we calculate the remaining water inventory for the targets, the percentage of
cases that are continuing to lose water, and the rate at which these cases are
losing water.

to develop tools for inferring these rates from publicly available daily

depend on covariates, such as hospital bed occupancy and daily SARS-CoV-2 test
positivity rate, which may drive changes in hospital ICU operations. We
demonstrate via simulation studies that the proposed method performs well on
noisy time series data and apply our statistical framework to hospitalization

death rates can vary with covariates, we find, through rigorous model
selection, that hospitalization and positivity rates are crucial covariates for
modeling ICU stay dynamics and validate our per-patient ICU stay estimates
using anonymized patient-level UCI hospital data.

influence maximization to sensor placement to content recommendation, is to
select the optimal group of $k$ items from a larger set. Submodularity has been
very effective in allowing approximation algorithms for such subset selection
problems. However, in several applications, we are interested not only in the
elements of a set, but also the order in which they appear, breaking the
assumption that all selected items receive equal consideration. One such
category of applications involves the presentation of search results, product
recommendations, news articles, and other content, due to the well-documented
phenomenon that humans pay greater attention to higher-ranked items. As a
result, optimization in content presentation for diversity, user coverage,
calibration, or other objectives more accurately represents a sequence
selection problem, to which traditional submodularity approximation results no
longer apply. Although extensions of submodularity to sequences have been
proposed, none is designed to model settings where items contribute based on
their position in a ranked list, and hence they are not able to express these
types of optimization problems. In this paper, we aim to address this modeling
gap.
  Here, we propose a new formalism of ordered submodularity that captures these
ordering problems in content presentation, and more generally a category of
optimization problems over ranked sequences in which different list positions
contribute differently to the objective function. We analyze the natural
ordered analogue of the greedy algorithm and show that it provides a
$2$-approximation. We also show that this bound is tight, establishing that our
new framework is conceptually and quantitatively distinct from previous
formalisms of set and sequence submodularity.

three-step Newton-Traub technique for solving nonlinear equations in Banach
spaces with a convergence rate of five. The first order derivative of a
nonlinear operator is assumed to satisfy the generalized Lipschitz condition,
i.e. the $\kappa$-average condition. Furthermore, a few results on the
convergence of the same method in Banach spaces are developed under the
assumption that the derivative of the operators satisfies the radius or center
Lipschitz condition with a weak $\kappa$-average, and that $\kappa$ is a
positive integrable function but not necessarily non-decreasing. Our new notion
provides a tighter convergence analysis without the need for new circumstances.
As a result, we broaden the applicability of iterative approaches. Theoretical
results are supported further by illuminating examples. The existence and
uniqueness of the solution $x^*$ are examined in the convergence theorem. In
the end, we achieve weaker sufficient convergence criteria and more specific
information on the position of the solution than previous efforts requiring the
same computational effort. We obtain the convergence theorems as well as some
novel results by applying the results to some specific functions for
$\kappa(u)$. A numerical test is carried out to corroborate the hypothesis
established in this work.

proposes Pond, the first memory pooling system that both meets cloud
performance goals and significantly reduces DRAM cost. Pond builds on the
Compute Express Link (CXL) standard for load/store access to pool memory and
two key insights. First, our analysis of cloud production traces shows that
pooling across 8-16 sockets is enough to achieve most of the benefits. This
enables a small-pool design with low access latency. Second, it is possible to
create machine learning models that can accurately predict how much local and
pool memory to allocate to a virtual machine (VM) to resemble same-NUMA-node
memory performance. Our evaluation with 158 workloads shows that Pond reduces
DRAM costs by 7% with performance within 1-5% of same-NUMA-node VM allocations.

success in recent years on various multi-modal benchmarks. However, the

image-text data, which is costly to collect, compared to image-only or

pre-training (UVLP) to learn the cross-modal representation from non-parallel
image and text datasets. We found two key factors that lead to good
unsupervised V+L pre-training without parallel data: (i) joint image-and-text
input (ii) overall image-text alignment (even for non-parallel data).
Accordingly, we propose a novel unsupervised V+L pre-training curriculum for
non-parallel texts and images. We first construct a weakly aligned image-text
corpus via a retrieval-based approach, then apply a set of multi-granular
alignment pre-training tasks, including region-to-tag, region-to-phrase, and
image-to-sentence alignment, to bridge the gap between the two modalities. A
comprehensive ablation study shows each granularity is helpful to learn a
stronger pre-trained model. We adapt our pre-trained model to a set of V+L
downstream tasks, including VQA, NLVR2, Visual Entailment, and RefCOCO+. Our
model achieves the state-of-art performance in all these tasks under the

annihilation experiments, background contributions from the continuum amplitude
and its interference with the resonance amplitude are irreducible. These
effects become more and more significant as the precision of experimental
measurements improves. While the former can be easily subtracted with data
taken off the resonance peak, the latter depends on the relative size and phase
between the resonance and continuum amplitudes. Two ratios are defined to
estimate the size of these effects, $r_{R}^{f}$ for the ratio of the
contribution of the interference term to the resonance term and $r_{c}^{f}$ for
that to the continuum term. We find that $r_{R}^{f}$ could be as large as a few
percent for narrow resonances, and both $r_{R}^{f}$ and $r_{c}^{f}$ could be
large for broad resonances. This indicates that the interference effect is
crucial for the measurements of the branching fractions aiming at the percent

idea is to incorporate the internal inhomogeneity information (e.g., edges of

the conductivity profiles (to be detected). We study the NWATV image
reconstruction by employing a novel soft thresholding based reformulation
included in the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). To evaluate
the proposed approach, 2D and 3D numerical experiments and human EIT lung
imaging are carried out. It is demonstrated that the properties of the internal
inhomogeneity are well preserved and improved with the proposed regularization
approach, in comparison to traditional total variation (TV) and recently
proposed fidelity embedded regularization approaches. Owing to the simplicity
of the proposed method, the computational cost is significantly decreased
compared with the well established primal-dual algorithm. Meanwhile, it was
found that the proposed regularization method is quite robust to the
measurement noise, which is one of the main uncertainties in EIT.

the main reason is that real-world applications can only access the text
outputs by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, which may be with
errors because of the limitation of model capacity. Through further analysis of
the ASR outputs, we find that in some cases the sentiment words, the key
sentiment elements in the textual modality, are recognized as other words,
which makes the sentiment of the text change and hurts the performance of
multimodal sentiment models directly. To address this problem, we propose the
sentiment word aware multimodal refinement model (SWRM), which can dynamically
refine the erroneous sentiment words by leveraging multimodal sentiment clues.
Specifically, we first use the sentiment word position detection module to
obtain the most possible position of the sentiment word in the text and then
utilize the multimodal sentiment word refinement module to dynamically refine
the sentiment word embeddings. The refined embeddings are taken as the textual
inputs of the multimodal feature fusion module to predict the sentiment labels.

  Learning on Image Filters","14 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image filters are fast, lightweight and effective, which make these
conventional wisdoms preferable as basic tools in vision tasks. In practical
scenarios, users have to tweak parameters multiple times to obtain satisfied
results. This inconvenience heavily discounts the efficiency and user
experience. We propose basis composition learning on single image filters to
automatically determine their optimal formulas. The feasibility is based on a
two-step strategy: first, we build a set of filtered basis (FB) consisting of
approximations under selected parameter configurations; second, a dual-branch
composition module is proposed to learn how the candidates in FB are combined
to better approximate the target image. Our method is simple yet effective in
practice; it renders filters to be user-friendly and benefits fundamental
low-level vision problems including denoising, deraining and texture removal.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves an appropriate
balance among the performance, time complexity and memory efficiency.

  Anomaly Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Density-based and classification-based methods have ruled unsupervised
anomaly detection in recent years, while reconstruction-based methods are
rarely mentioned for the poor reconstruction ability and low performance.
However, the latter requires no costly extra training samples for the
unsupervised training that is more practical, so this paper focuses on
improving this kind of method and proposes a novel Omni-frequency
Channel-selection Reconstruction (OCR-GAN) network to handle anomaly detection
task in a perspective of frequency. Concretely, we propose a Frequency
Decoupling (FD) module to decouple the input image into different frequency
components and model the reconstruction process as a combination of parallel
omni-frequency image restorations, as we observe a significant difference in
the frequency distribution of normal and abnormal images. Given the correlation
among multiple frequencies, we further propose a Channel Selection (CS) module
that performs frequency interaction among different encoders by adaptively
selecting different channels. Abundant experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our approach over different kinds of methods,
e.g., achieving a new state-of-the-art 98.3 detection AUC on the MVTec AD
dataset without extra training data that markedly surpasses the
reconstruction-based baseline by +38.1 and the current SOTA method by +0.3.

intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics has allowed us to construct
a large number of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) that are distinct
from the traditional true number generators. This article provides a review of
the existing QRNGs with a focus on their various possible features (e.g.,
device independence, semi-device independence) that are not achievable in the
classical world. It also discusses the origin, applicability, and other facets
of randomness. Specifically, the origin of randomness is explored from the
perspective of a set of hierarchical axioms for quantum mechanics, implying
that succeeding axioms can be regarded as a superstructure constructed on top
of a structure built by the preceding axioms. The axioms considered are: (Q1)
incompatibility and uncertainty; (Q2) contextuality; (Q3) entanglement; (Q4)
nonlocality and (Q5) indistinguishability of identical particles. Relevant toy
generalized probability theories (GPTs) are introduced, and it is shown that
the origin of random numbers in different types of QRNGs known today are
associated with different layers of nonclassical theories and all of them do
not require all the features of quantum mechanics. Further, classification of
the available QRNGs has been done and the technological challenges associated
with each class are critically analyzed. Commercially available QRNGs are also
compared.

surplus or deficit in each nanogrid is embodied differently across time. To
stimulate local renewable energy consumption and minimize the long-term energy
cost, some issues still remain to be explored: when and how the energy demand
and bidirectional trading prices are scheduled considering personal comfort
preferences and environmental factors. For this purpose, the demand response
and two-way pricing problems concurrently for nanogrids and a public monitoring
entity (PME) are studied with exploiting the large potential thermal elastic
ability of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) units. Different
from nanogrids, in terms of minimizing time-average costs, PME aims to set
reasonable prices and optimize profits by trading with nanogrids and the main
grid bi-directionally. In particular, such bilevel energy management problem is
formulated as a stochastic form in a long-term horizon. Since there are
uncertain system parameters, time-coupled queue constraints and the interplay
of bilevel decision-making, it is challenging to solve the formulated problems.
To this end, we derive a form of relaxation based on Lyapunov optimization
technique to make the energy management problem tractable without forecasting
the related system parameters. The transaction between nanogrids and PME is
captured by a one-leader and multi-follower Stackelberg game framework. Then,
theoretical analysis of the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium

devise an optimization algorithm to reach the SE with less information
exchange. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

competing effects of silica surfaces: the emergence of larger pores as a result

first-order phase transition. Remarkably, the HIQTH effect vanishes close to
$H^*$. Furthermore, we find that the spin-fractionalization feature is retained
well above $H^\ast$. These imply the emergence of the phase transition that

clouds where the CO line peaks at a high velocity ($\sim$ 11000 \kms). \HI in
absorption also show high-velocity clouds around the D1 region, which might be
due to inflows caused by the merging of two or more galaxy components. Based on
the high-resolution K-band VLA and L-band VLBA observations of the radio
continuum emission, we derived the brightness temperature in the range $10^{5}$
K to $10^{6}$ K, which is consistent with other starburst dominant OHM sources
in the literature. The multi-band VLA observations show that the radio
continuum emission of comp D might also have contributions from free-free
emission, besides synchrotron emission. As a concenquence, these results
support a starburst origin for the OHMs, without the presence of an AGN.

The ESF is an investor-owned and independently-operated, seeking to maximize
its total profit while hedging the system against net-load variation. To do so,
an exact computationally efficient bi-level mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) is envisaged. The ESF operator tries to maximize its own profit at the
upper level while ISO seeks to clear the markets at the lower level. In
principle, the ESF will be able to construct its bidding/offering curves to
buy/sell from/to different markets. To maintain the tractability of the
problem, each lower level is replaced by its KKT optimality conditions, and
nonlinearities are converted into linear equivalents using strong duality
theory rendering the single-level MILP and consequently recast as an MPEC.
Additionally, the proposed framework is constructed according to the
information gap decision theory (IGDT) instrument to capture the adverse impact
of uncertainty on the profit of ESF.

Transformer based on Differentiable Trees (R2D2) makes it possible to scale to
large language model pre-training even with complex tree encoder by introducing
a heuristic pruning method. However, the rule-based pruning approach suffers
from local optimum and slow inference issues. In this paper, we fix those
issues in a unified method. We propose to use a top-down parser as a
model-based pruning method, which also enables parallel encoding during
inference. Typically, our parser casts parsing as a split point scoring task,
which first scores all split points for a given sentence, and then recursively
splits a span into two by picking a split point with the highest score in the
current span. The reverse order of the splits is considered as the order of
pruning in R2D2 encoder. Beside the bi-directional language model loss, we also
optimize the parser by minimizing the KL distance between tree probabilities
from parser and R2D2. Our experiments show that our Fast-R2D2 improves
performance significantly in grammar induction and achieves competitive results
in downstream classification tasks.

more specifically, in Location Science. When the location space is a network,
the most frequent assumption is to consider the candidate facility locations,
the points to be covered, or both, to be discrete sets. In this work, we study
the set-covering location problem when both candidate locations and demand
points are continuous sets on a network. This variant has received little
attention, and the scarce existing approaches have focused on particular cases,
such as tree networks and integer covering radius. Here we study the general
problem and present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation (MILP) for
networks with edges' lengths no greater than the covering radius. The model
does not lose generality, as any edge not satisfying this condition can be
partitioned into subedges of appropriate lengths without changing the problem.
We propose a preprocessing algorithm to reduce the size of the MILP, and devise
tight big-$M$ constants and valid inequalities to strengthen our formulations.
Moreover, a second MILP is proposed, which admits edges' lengths greater than
the covering radius. As opposed to existing formulations of the problem
(including the first MILP proposed herein), the number of variables and
constraints of this second model does not depend on the lengths of the
network's edges. This second model represents a scalable approach that
particularly suits real-world networks, whose edges are usually greater than
the covering radius. Our computational experiments show the strengths and
limitations of our exact approach on both real-world and random networks. Our
formulations are also tested against an existing exact method.

the competitive ratio is unbounded. In contrast, previous work on online
algorithms with untrusted predictions generally studied problems where an
online algorithm with a constant competitive ratio is known. The prediction,

the average size of those smallest items that fit in the knapsack. For the
prediction error in this hard online problem, we use the ratio
$r=\frac{a}{\hat{a}}$ where $a$ is the actual value for this average size and
$\hat{a}$ is the prediction. The algorithm presented achieves a competitive

of multiple characters. Such difference motivates us to investigate whether WWM
leads to better context understanding ability for Chinese BERT. To achieve
this, we introduce two probing tasks related to grammatical error correction
and ask pretrained models to revise or insert tokens in a masked language
modeling manner. We construct a dataset including labels for 19,075 tokens in
10,448 sentences. We train three Chinese BERT models with standard
character-level masking (CLM), WWM, and a combination of CLM and WWM,
respectively. Our major findings are as follows: First, when one character
needs to be inserted or replaced, the model trained with CLM performs the best.
Second, when more than one character needs to be handled, WWM is the key to
better performance. Finally, when being fine-tuned on sentence-level downstream
tasks, models trained with different masking strategies perform comparably.

Computability results are obtained within the framework of effectively given

preventing earthquakes through fluid injections in the earth's crust. The
designed robust controllers drive aseismically a fault system to a new
equilibrium point of lower energy by tracking a slow reference signal. The
control design is based on a reduced-order nonlinear model able to reproduce
earthquake-like instabilities. Uncertainties related to the frictional and
mechanical properties of the underlying physical process and external
perturbations are considered. Two types of controllers are derived. The first
one is based on sliding-mode theory and leads to local finite-time convergence
of the tracking error and rejection of Lipschitz w.r.t. time perturbations. The
second controller is based on LQR control and presents global exponential
stability of the tracking error and rejection of Lipschitz w.r.t. states
perturbations. Both controllers generate a continuous control signal,
attenuating the chattering effect in the case of the sliding-mode algorithms.
The developed controllers are tested extensively and compared on the basis of
numerical simulations and experiments in the laboratory. The present work opens
new perspectives for the application of robust nonlinear control theory to
complex geosystems, earthquakes and sustainable energy production.

context, Automatic Depression Detection (ADD) has been attracting more
attention for its low cost and objectivity. ADD systems are able to detect
depression automatically from some medical records, like video sequences.
However, it remains challenging to effectively extract depression-specific
information from long sequences, thereby hindering a satisfying accuracy. In
this paper, we propose a novel ADD method via learning and fusing features from

the Feature-Wise Attention (FWA) module is adopted to fuse different features

further enhance the detection accuracy. Our method achieves the

an object detector that processes these images. The quality of the images
directly affects the performance of the object detector. Many works nowadays
focus either on improving the image quality or improving the object detection

two subsystems. The goal of this paper is to tune the detection throughput and
accuracy of existing object detectors in the remote sensing scenario by
focusing on optimizing the input images tailored to the object detector. To
achieve this, we empirically analyze the influence of two selected camera

five image parameters (quantization, compression, resolution, color model,
additional channels) for these applications. For our experiments, we utilize
three UAV data sets from different domains and a mixture of large and small

divide videos into semantically coherent and taxonomy-free units, and could
serve as an important pre-processing step for long-form video understanding.
Previous works often separately handle these different types of generic
boundaries with specific designs of deep networks from simple CNN to LSTM.
Instead, in this paper, we present Temporal Perceiver, a general architecture
with Transformer, offering a unified solution to the detection of arbitrary
generic boundaries, ranging from shot-level, event-level, to scene-level GBDs.
The core design is to introduce a small set of latent feature queries as
anchors to compress the redundant video input into a fixed dimension via
cross-attention blocks. Thanks to this fixed number of latent units, it greatly
reduces the quadratic complexity of attention operation to a linear form of
input frames. Specifically, to explicitly leverage the temporal structure of
videos, we construct two types of latent feature queries: boundary queries and
context queries, which handle the semantic incoherence and coherence
accordingly. Moreover, to guide the learning of latent feature queries, we
propose an alignment loss on the cross-attention maps to explicitly encourage
the boundary queries to attend on the top boundary candidates. Finally, we
present a sparse detection head on the compressed representation, and directly
output the final boundary detection results without any post-processing module.
We test our Temporal Perceiver on a variety of GBD benchmarks. Our method
obtains the state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks with RGB single-stream

However, inconsistencies between onboard and server estimates can occur due to

between robot and server graphs are exploited at different spatial scales using
graph spectral analysis to generate necessary constraints for the individual

chance of being damaged and falling. We hypothesize that humanoid robots would
be mostly used in buildings, which makes them likely to be close to a wall. To
avoid a fall, they can therefore lean on the closest wall, as a human would do,
provided that they find in a few milliseconds where to put the hand(s). This
article introduces a method, called D-Reflex, that learns a neural network that
chooses this contact position given the wall orientation, the wall distance,
and the posture of the robot. This contact position is then used by a
whole-body controller to reach a stable posture. We show that D-Reflex allows a
simulated TALOS robot (1.75m, 100kg, 30 degrees of freedom) to avoid more than
75% of the avoidable falls and can work on the real robot.

algorithms, such as the adaptive GSP Least Mean Squares (GLMS) algorithm and
the normalized GLMS (GNLMS) algorithm, the GNLMP algorithm has the ability to
reconstruct a graph signal that is corrupted by non-Gaussian noise with
heavy-tailed characteristics. Compared to the recently introduced adaptive GSP

of iterations to converge to a steady graph signal. The convergence condition
of the GNLMP algorithm is derived, and the ability of the GNLMP algorithm to
process multidimensional time-varying graph signals with multiple features is
demonstrated as well. Simulations show the performance of the GNLMP algorithm
in estimating steady-state and time-varying graph signals is faster than GLMP

accretion disk is thought to influence its rotational evolution. We use 2.5D
magnetohydrodynamic, axisymmetric simulations of star-disk interaction,
computed via the PLUTO code, to calculate the net torque acting on these stars.
We divide the net torque into three contributions: accretion (spin-up), stellar
winds (spin-down), and magnetospheric ejections (MEs) (spin-up or down). In
Paper I, we explored interaction regimes in which the stellar magnetosphere
truncates the inner disk at a location spinning faster than the star, resulting
in a strong net spin-up contribution from accretion and MEs (""steady accretion""
regime). In this paper, we investigate interaction regimes in which the
truncation radius gets closer to and even exceeds corotation, where it is
possible for the disk material to gain angular momentum and be periodically
ejected by the centrifugal barrier (""propeller"" regime). This reduces the
accretion torque, can change the sign of the ME torque, and can result in a net
stellar spin-down configuration. These results suggest it is possible to have a
net spin-down stellar torque even for truncation radii within the corotation
radius ($R_\text{t} \gtrsim 0.7 R_\text{co}$). We fit semi-analytic functions
for the truncation radius, and the torque associated with star-disk interaction
(i.e., the sum of accretion and ME torques) and stellar wind, allowing for the
prediction of the net stellar torque for a parameter regime covering both net
spin-up and spin-down configurations, as well as the possibility of
investigating rotational evolution via 1D stellar evolution codes.

quality compared to regular patterns due to reduced aliasing effects. On the
downside, random patterns feature large void areas which is also
disadvantageous. In the scope of this work, we present two techniques to design
optimized non-regular image sampling patterns for arbitrary sampling densities.

tune the Zeeman energy splitting by applying an external magnetic field. In
this way, the prerequisites for stimulated emission by means of resonant
microwaves in the 10 GHz range are fulfilled. On the way to realising a maser,
we were able to systematically solve a series of subtasks that improved the
underlying relevant physical parameters of the SiC samples. Among others, we

  For proof of concept, we examine the IID representation learning on
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization tasks. Concretely, by utilizing the

prediction of molecular characteristics (molecular prediction) on two

CeAu1-xCuxGe, with potentially unusual electronic states, in the whole
concentration range (x = 0.0 - 1.0). The parent CeAuGe compound, crystallizing
in a non-centrosymmetric hexagonal structure, is a ferromagnetic semimetal with
Curie temperature 10 K. Cu-doping on Au-site of CeAuGe, CeAu1-xCuxGe, changes
the crystal structure from the non-centrosymmetric (P63mc) to centrosymmetric
(P63/mmc) space group at the concentration x ~ 0.5, where the c-lattice
constant has a maximum value. Magnetic susceptibility and electrical
resistivity measurements reveal that all Cu-doped compounds undergo magnetic
phase transition near 10 K, with the maximum transition temperature of 12 K for
x = 0.5. The neutron powder diffraction experiments show the ferromagnetic
ordering of Ce3+ magnetic moments with a value of ~ 1.2 Bohr magneton at 1.8 K,
oriented perpendicular to the hexagonal c-axis. By using symmetry analysis, we
have found the solutions for the magnetic structure in the ferromagnetic
Shubnikov space groups Cmc'21' and P21'/m' for x < 0.5 and x >= 0.5,
respectively. Electrical resistivity exhibits a metallic temperature behaviour
in all compounds. The resistivity has a local minimum in the paramagnetic state
due to Kondo effects at high doping x = 0.8 and 1.0. At the small Cu-doping
level, x = 0.2, the resistivity shows a broad feature at the ferromagnetic
transition temperature and an additional transition-like peculiarity at 2.5 K
in the ferromagnetic state.

higher resolution images without increasing the number of pixels. This is
achieved by covering three quarters of each pixel of a low-resolution sensor
such that only one quadrant of the sensor area of each pixel is sensitive to
light. By randomly masking different parts, effectively a non-regular sampling
of a higher resolution image is performed. Combining a properly designed mask
and a high-quality reconstruction algorithm, a higher image quality can be
achieved than using a low-resolution sensor and subsequent upsampling. For the
latter case, the image quality can be enhanced using super resolution
algorithms. Recently, algorithms based on machine learning such as the Very
Deep Super Resolution network (VDSR) proofed to be successful for this task. In
this work, we transfer the concepts of VDSR to the special case of quarter
sampling. Besides adapting the network layout to take advantage of the case of
quarter sampling, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique enabled by
quarter sampling. Altogether, using the quarter sampling sensor, the image
quality in terms of PSNR can be increased by +0.67 dB for the Urban 100 dataset

While resetting to a synchronized state, it may happen between two successive

random time interval between the two resets. Here, we unveil how such a
protocol of stochastic resetting dramatically modifies the phase diagram of the
bare model, allowing in particular for the emergence of a synchronized phase

different topological structures on the solution behaviour, in particular
regarding crystallization and melting processes. In addition, we compare
protiated and deuterated microgels, in both water and deuterated water. The DSC
results are complemented by dynamic light scattering experiments, which confirm
that the selective isotopic substitution differently affects the solution
behaviour. Our findings highlight the important role played by the polymer
architecture on the solution behaviour: indeed, microgels turn out to be more
efficient confining agents, able to avoid water crystallization in a wider
concentration range with respect to linear chains. Altogether, the present data
will be valuable to interpret future low-temperature investigations of PNIPAM
dispersions, particularly by neutron scattering experiments.

of a quark-antiquark color dipole subject to high-energy evolution, which are
represented by a set of dipoles generated by a stochastic binary branching
process, in the scattering off a large nucleus, and produce predictions for
diffractive dissociation in electron-ion collisions, based on the dipole
picture of QCD. Our main results are as follows. First, the scattering events
of a color dipole, when parameters are set in such a way that the total cross
section is small, are triggered by rare partonic fluctuations, which look
different as seen from different reference frames. It turns out that the
freedom to select a frame allows to deduce an asymptotic expression for the
rapidity distribution of the first branching of the slowest parent dipole of
the set of those which scatter. In another aspect, such study implies the
importance of the characterization of particle distribution in the frontier
region in the states generated by the QCD dipole branching, and more generally,
by any one-dimensional branching random walk model. To this aim, we develop a
Monte Carlo algorithm to generate the frontier region of a branching random
walk. Furthermore, we are able to calculate the diffractive cross section
demanding a minimal rapidity gap $Y_0$ and the distribution of rapidity gaps
$Y_{gap}$ in the diffractive dissociation of a small dipole off a large
nucleus, in a well-defined parametric region. They are the asymptotic solutions
to the so-called Kovchegov-Levin equation, which describes the diffractive
dissociation at high energy. Finally, we present predictions for the rapidity
gap distributionin realistic kinematics of future electron-ion machines, based
on the numerical solutions of the original Kovchegov-Levin equation and of its

in the diagnosis of several cardiac pathologies. However, it remains more
challenging to segment the RV than the left ventricle (LV). In this paper, we
focus on segmenting the RV in both short (SA) and long-axis (LA) cardiac MR
images simultaneously. For this task, we propose a new multi-input/output
architecture, hybrid 2D/3D geometric spatial TransformEr Multi-Pass fEature
pyRAmid (Tempera). Our feature pyramid extends current designs by allowing not
only a multi-scale feature output but multi-scale SA and LA input images as
well. Tempera transfers learned features between SA and LA images via layer
weight sharing and incorporates a geometric target transformer to map the
predicted SA segmentation to LA space. Our model achieves an average Dice score
of 0.836 and 0.798 for the SA and LA, respectively, and 26.31 mm and 31.19 mm
Hausdorff distances. This opens up the potential for the incorporation of RV
segmentation models into clinical workflows.

proposes a real-time centimeter-level indoor localization method based on
psycho-visually invisible projected tags (IPT), requiring a projector as the
sender and quadrotors with high-speed cameras as the receiver. The method
includes a modulation process for the sender, as well as demodulation and pose
estimation steps for the receiver, where screen-camera communication technology
is applied to hide fiducial tags using human vision property. Experiments have
demonstrated that IPT can achieve accuracy within ten centimeters and a speed
of about ten FPS. Compared with other localization methods for AR robotics
platforms, IPT is affordable by using only a projector and high-speed cameras
as hardware consumption and convenient by omitting a coordinate alignment step.
To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first time screen-camera
communication is utilized for AR robot localization.

conjecture that the ellipsoid is the only inclusion possessing the uniformity
property that a uniform eigenstrain is transformed into a uniform elastic
strain. For the three-dimensional isotropic medium, the weak version of the
Eshelby conjecture has been substantiated. The previous work of Ammari et al.
substantiates the strong version of the Eshelby conjecture for the cases when
the three eigenvalues of the eigenstress are distinct or all the same, whereas
the case where two of the eigenvalues of the eigenstress are identical and the
other one is distinct remains a difficult problem. In this work, we study the
latter case. To this end, firstly, we present and prove a necessary condition
for a convex inclusion being capable of transforming a single uniform
eigenstress into a uniform elastic stress field. Since the necessary condition
is not enough to determine the shape of the inclusion, secondly, we introduce a
constraint that is concerned with the material parameters, and prove that there
exist combinations of the elastic tensors and uniform eigenstresses such that
only an ellipsoid can have the Eshelby uniformity property for these
combinations simultaneously. Finally, we provide a more specifically
constrained proof of the conjecture by proving that for the uniform strain
fields constrained to that induced by an ellipsoid from a set of specified
uniform eigenstresses, the strong version of the Eshelby conjecture is true for
a set of isotropic elastic tensors which are associated with the specified
uniform eigenstresses. This work makes some progress towards the complete
solution of the intriguing and longstanding Eshelby conjecture for
three-dimensional isotropic media.

model to the Spitzer data shows no significant thermal hotspot offset, in
contrast to the previously observed offset for the well-studied USP planet 55

collected by Kepler during two separate K2 campaigns. We model the planetary
emission with a range of toy models that include a reflective and a thermal
contribution. With a two-temperature model, we measure a dayside temperature of
2049 +/- 361 K and a night-side temperature that is consistent with zero (Tp,n

a better fit to the data than a uniform dayside temperature (DeltaBIC = 22.2).
We also find evidence for a non-zero geometric albedo Ag = 0.28 +/- 0.07. We
also compare the data to a physically motivated, pseudo-2D rock vapor model and
a 1D turbulent boundary layer model. Both models fit the data well. Notably, we
find that the optical eclipse depth can be explained by thermal emission from a
hot inversion layer, rather than reflected light. A thermal inversion may also
be responsible for the deep optical eclipse observed for another USP, Kepler-10
b. Finally, we significantly improve the ephemerides for K2-141 b and c, which

that we each split into three user groups differing in their inclination to
popularity, i.e., LowPop, MedPop and HighPop. Using these user groups, we
evaluate four collaborative filtering-based algorithms with respect to
popularity bias on the item and the user level. Our findings are three-fold:
firstly, we show that users with little interest into popular items tend to
have large user profiles and thus, are important data sources for multimedia
recommender systems. Secondly, we find that popular items are recommended more
frequently than unpopular ones. Thirdly, we find that users with little
interest into popular items receive significantly worse recommendations than
users with medium or high interest into popularity.

can exceed this threshold if they are highly precessing and they exceed a

detection approaches on unseen data difficult. Several contemporary evaluation

larger, and the performance of Deep Neural Networks is known to fluctuate

empirically demonstrate that current protocols may fail to provide reliable

elastic mechanical lattice which supports translational and rotational waves.
The model used in this work is motivated by the recent experimental results of
B. Deng et al., Nat. Commun. 9, 3410 (2018). This lattice is characterized by
strong geometrical nonlinearities and the coupling of two degrees-of-freedom
(DoFs) per site. Although the linear limit of the structure consists of a
linear Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and a linear Klein-Gordon (KG) lattice
whose DoFs are uncoupled, by using single site initial excitations on the
rotational DoF, we evoke the nonlinear coupling between the system's
translational and rotational DoFs. Our results reveal that such coupling
induces rich wave-packet spreading behavior in the presence of strong disorder.
In the weakly nonlinear regime, we observe energy spreading only due to the
coupling of the two DoFs (per site) which is in contrast to what is known for
KG lattices with a single DoF per lattice site, where the spreading occurs due
to chaoticity. Additionally, for strong nonlinearities, we show that initially
localized wave-packets attain near ballistic behavior in contrast to other
known models. We also reveal persistent chaos during energy spreading, although
its strength decreases in time as quantified by the evolution of the system's
finite-time maximum Lyapunov exponent. Our results show that flexible,
disordered and strongly nonlinear lattices are a viable platform to study
energy transport in combination with multiple DoFs (per site), also present an
alternative way to control energy spreading in heterogeneous media.

reasons (e.g., a hammer with uneven mass distribution) or task constraints
(e.g., food that should not be spoiled). In such situations, the preferences of
experts need to be taken into account.
  In this paper, we introduce a data-efficient grasping pipeline (Latent Space
GP Selector -- LGPS) that learns grasp preferences with only a few labels per
object (typically 1 to 4) and generalizes to new views of this object. Our
pipeline is based on learning a latent space of grasps with a dataset generated
with any state-of-the-art grasp generator (e.g., Dex-Net). This latent space is
then used as a low-dimensional input for a Gaussian process classifier that
selects the preferred grasp among those proposed by the generator.

as CLIP-GEN for general text-to-image generation with the language-image priors
extracted with a pre-trained CLIP model. In our approach, we only require a set
of unlabeled images in the general domain to train a text-to-image generator.
Specifically, given an image without text labels, we first extract the
embedding of the image in the united language-vision embedding space with the
image encoder of CLIP. Next, we convert the image into a sequence of discrete
tokens in the VQGAN codebook space (the VQGAN model can be trained with the
unlabeled image dataset in hand). Finally, we train an autoregressive
transformer that maps the image tokens from its unified language-vision
representation. Once trained, the transformer can generate coherent image
tokens based on the text embedding extracted from the text encoder of CLIP upon
an input text. Such a strategy enables us to train a strong and general
text-to-image generator with large text-free image dataset such as ImageNet.
Qualitative and quantitative evaluations verify that our method significantly
outperforms optimization-based text-to-image methods in terms of image quality
while not compromising the text-image matching. Our method can even achieve

  University, 2020",,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reinforcement learning defines the problem facing agents that learn to make
good decisions through action and observation alone. To be effective problem
solvers, such agents must efficiently explore vast worlds, assign credit from
delayed feedback, and generalize to new experiences, all while making use of
limited data, computational resources, and perceptual bandwidth. Abstraction is
essential to all of these endeavors. Through abstraction, agents can form
concise models of their environment that support the many practices required of
a rational, adaptive decision maker. In this dissertation, I present a theory
of abstraction in reinforcement learning. I first offer three desiderata for
functions that carry out the process of abstraction: they should 1) preserve
representation of near-optimal behavior, 2) be learned and constructed
efficiently, and 3) lower planning or learning time. I then present a suite of
new algorithms and analysis that clarify how agents can learn to abstract
according to these desiderata. Collectively, these results provide a partial
path toward the discovery and use of abstraction that minimizes the complexity
of effective reinforcement learning.

citizens and take back control. Citizens are locked into big-tech for personal

proven to be essential, especially due to increased home Internet traffic
during the COVID pandemic. Citizens do not possess their own travel documents.
The European Commission aims to transition this governmental property towards
self-sovereign identity, introducing many new opportunities. Citizens are
locked into banks with non-portable IBAN accounts and unsustainable legacy
banking infrastructures. Migration to all-digital low-fraud infrastructures and
healthier competitive ecosystems is essential. The overall challenge is to
return the power to citizens and users again. The transition to a more
decentralized Internet is the first crucial step in the realization of
user-centricity. This thesis presents the first exploratory study that
integrates governmental-issued travel documents into a (decentralized) societal

private and secure transfer of money and data, and can effectively provide
trust in authenticity that is currently missing in online conversations. A

kernel technique into it and more importantly, follows the success on
systematically solving its linear task. Its optimal condition is explored
theoretically and a working set selection alternating direction method of

Moreover, we firstly present a closed-form definition to the support vector

are only located on the parallel decision surfaces. The experiment part also
shows that $L_{0/1}$-KSVM has much fewer SVs, simultaneously with a decent
predicting accuracy, when comparing to its linear peer $L_{0/1}$-SVM and the
other six nonlinear benchmark SVM classifiers.

environments to combat the severe attenuation and blockages in millimeter-wave
(mmWave) bands. However, to achieve the optimal enhancement of performance, the
instantaneous channel state information (CSI) needs to be estimated at the cost
of a large overhead that scales with the number of RIS elements and the number
of users. In this paper, we design a quasi-static broad coverage at the RIS
with the reduced overhead based on the statistical CSI. We propose a design
framework to synthesize the power pattern reflected by the RIS that meets the
customized requirements of broad coverage. For the communication of broadcast
channels, we generalize the broad coverage of the single transmit stream to the
scenario of multiple streams. Moreover, we employ the quasi-static broad
coverage for a multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access
(OFDMA) system, and derive the analytical expression of the downlink rate,
which is proved to increase logarithmically with the power gain reflected by
the RIS. By taking into account the overhead of channel estimation, the
proposed quasi-static broad coverage even outperforms the design method that
optimizes the RIS phases using the instantaneous CSI. Numerical simulations are
conducted to verify these observations.

Electron anti-neutrinos are detected via the inverse beta decay by measuring
the correlated positron and neutron signals. In this detection channel cosmic
ray muon induced radioactive isotopes are the main background, especially those
connected to cosmogenic backgrounds ($^{9}$Li/$^{8}$He and fast neutrons). They
are predominantly produced by showing muons which account for about 10\% of all
muons. Considering that the $^{9}$Li/$^{8}$He background is correlated with the
parent muon in time and space, the vertex reconstruction of showers along the
muon track is helpful to reject the backgrounds of $^{9}$Li/$^{8}$He and other
isotopes. Based on the waveform simulation analysis, we know that the
multi-peaks in waveform output by PMTs are mainly caused by these showers.
Waveform analysis of muon events and preliminary results of shower vertex

targeting M dwarfs because any habitable zone terrestrial-mass planets will
induce a high RV and orbit on shorter periods than for more massive stars. One
of the main caveats is that M dwarfs show a wide range of activity levels from
inactive to very active, which can induce an asymmetry in the line profiles
and, consequently, a spurious RV measurement. We aim to benchmark the impact of
stellar activity on high-precision RV measurements using regular-cadence
CARMENES visible and near-infrared observations of the active M3.5 dwarf EV
Lac. We used the newly developed technique of low-resolution Doppler imaging to
determine the centre-of-light, or spot-induced RV component, for eight
observational epochs. We confirm a statistically significant and strong
correlation between the independently measured centre-of-light and the
chromatic index, which is a measure of the amplitude variation with wavelength
of the RVs. We also find circular closed-loop relations of several activity
indices with RV for a subset of data that covers only several rotation periods.
We also investigate the implications of large phase gaps in the periodograms of
activity indicators. Finally, by removing the spot-induced RV component we
improve the planet-mass sensitivity by a factor of at least three. We conclude
that for active M stars, a regular-cadence observing strategy is the most
efficient way to identify and eliminate sources of correlated noise.

joint deblurring and denoising approach that had been previously proved to be
effective for the restoration of THz-TDS images in transmission geometry, but
that had never been tested in reflection modality. This mode is often the only
one that can be effectively used in most cases, for example when analyzing
objects that are either opaque in the THz range, or that cannot be displaced
from their location (e.g., museums), such as those of cultural interest.
Compared to transmission mode, reflection geometry introduces, however, further
distortion to THz data, neglected in existing literature. In this work, we
successfully implement image deblurring and denoising of both uniform-shape
samples (a contemporary 1 Euro cent coin and an inlaid pendant) and samples
with the uneven reliefs and corrosion products on the surface which make the

during gas pressure change across the transition region between $\alpha$ and
$\gamma$ discharge modes. The hysteresis is manifested in that the critical
pressure of mode transition depends on the direction of pressure change. As a
corollary, the plasma would attain different discharge properties under the
same operating parameters (pressure, power, and gas composition), suggesting a
bi-stability or existence of memory effect. Analysis of the rotational and
vibrational temperatures measured from the OH (A-X) line emissions shows that
the hysteresis is mainly due to the fast gas heating in the $\gamma$-mode
leading to a smaller neutral density than that of the $\alpha$-mode. When
increasing the gas pressure, the $\gamma$-mode discharge maintains a relatively
higher temperature and lower neutral density, and thus, it requires a higher
operating pressure to reach the $\alpha$-mode. On the other hand, decreasing
the pressure while maintaining $\alpha$-mode, the transition to $\gamma$-mode
occurs at a lower pressure than the former case due to a relatively higher
neutral density of $\alpha$-mode discharge. This interpretation is supported by
the fact that the hysteresis disappears when the plasma properties are
presented with respect to the neutral gas density instead of pressure.

approach is based on e-values, a new tool for hypothesis testing. An e-value is
a random variable with expected value less or equal to one under a null
hypothesis. Large e-values give evidence against the null hypothesis, and the
multiplicative inverse of an e-value is a p-value. Our test uses online
isotonic regression to estimate the calibration curve as a `betting strategy'
against the null hypothesis. We show that the test has power against
essentially all alternatives, which makes it theoretically superior to the HL
test and at the same time resolves the well-known instability problem of the
latter. A simulation study shows that a feasible version of the proposed eHL
test can detect slight miscalibrations in practically relevant sample sizes,
but trades its universal validity and power guarantees against a reduced
empirical power compared to the HL test in a classical simulation setup.We
illustrate our test on recalibrated predictions for credit card defaults during
the Taiwan credit card crisis, where the classical HL test delivers equivocal
results.

struggled to clearly define and implement HCML in computer science. This
article proposes practices for human-centered machine learning, an area where
studying and designing for social, cultural, and ethical implications are just
as important as technical advances in ML. These practices bridge between
interdisciplinary perspectives of HCI, AI, and sociotechnical fields, as well
as ongoing discourse on this new area. The five practices include ensuring HCML

allows to transfer an unknown arbitrary quantum state from one location to
another without having to transmit the quantum system through the intermediate
region. Quantum states, quantum channels, and indefinite causal structures are
all examples of quantum causal structures that not only enable advanced quantum
information processing functions, but can also model causal structures in
nonclassical spacetimes. In this letter, we develop quantum teleportation of
arbitrary quantum causal structures, as formalized by the process matrix
framework. Instead of teleporting all the physical degrees of freedom that
implement the causal structure, the central idea is to just teleport the inputs
to and outputs from the operations of agents. The communication of outcomes of
Bell state measurements, which is necessary for deterministic quantum
teleportation, is not possible for all causal structures that one might wish to
investigate. To avoid this problem, we propose partially and fully
post-selected teleportation protocols. We prove that our partially
post-selected teleportation protocol is compatible with all quantum causal
structures, including those that involve indefinite causal order.

introduce HDBSCAN instead of DBSCAN to do clustering, which can generate better

plasma-assisted combustion. In this research we investigate positive streamers
in a stoichiometric air-methane mixture at 1 bar and 300 K with a
three-dimensional particle-in-cell model for the electrons. We first discuss
suitable electron scattering cross sections and an extension of the
photoionization mechanism to air-methane mixtures. We discuss that the addition
of 9.5% methane leaves electron transport and reaction coefficients essentially
unchanged, but it largely suppresses photoionization and shortens the photon
mean free path. This leads to (1) accelerated streamer branching, (2) higher
electric field enhancement at the streamer head, (3) lower internal electric
fields, and (4) higher electron densities in the streamer channel. We also
calculate the time-integrated energy density deposited during the evolution of
positive streamers in background electric fields of 12.5 and 20 kV/cm. We find
typical values of the deposited energy density in the range of 0.5-2.5
kJ/m$^{3}$ within the ionized interior of streamers with a length of 5 mm; this
value is rather independent of the electric fields applied here. Finally we
find that the energy deposited in the inelastic electron scattering processes
mainly produces reactive nitrogen species: N$_2$ triplet states and N, but also
O and H radicals. The production of H$_2$ and O$_2$ singlet states also occurs
albeit less pronounced. Our calculation of the primary production of reactive
species can for example be used in global chemistry models.

problem is that the cycle must be embedded without bends and does not intersect
itself and the polygon. This problem is a special case of the open problem of
finding a (s, X, t) - simple Hamiltonian path inside a simple polygon that does
not intersect itself and the sides of the polygon. The complexity of the
problem is examined in this paper is open, but it has been proved that similar

a genetic algorithm for straight-line embedding of a cycle with the minimum
numbers of intersections, onto a given set of points inside simple polygons.
The efficiency of the proposed genetic algorithm is due to the definition of
the mutation operation, which removes it if there is an intersection between
the embedded edges of the cycle. The experimental results show that the results
of the version of the algorithm that uses this mutation operation are much more
efficient than the version that uses only the usual two-points mutation
operation.

  (MIDL) 2022",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fundus photography has been routinely used to document the presence and
severity of various retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macula
degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy, for which the fovea, optic
disc (OD), and optic cup (OC) are important anatomical landmarks.
Identification of those anatomical landmarks is of great clinical importance.
However, the presence of lesions, drusen, and other abnormalities during
retinal degeneration severely complicates automatic landmark detection and
segmentation. Most existing works treat the identification of each landmark as
a single task and typically do not make use of any clinical prior information.
In this paper, we present a novel method, named JOINED, for prior guided
multi-task learning for joint OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection. An
auxiliary branch for distance prediction, in addition to a segmentation branch
and a detection branch, is constructed to effectively utilize the distance
information from each image pixel to landmarks of interest. Our proposed JOINED
pipeline consists of a coarse stage and a fine stage. At the coarse stage, we
obtain the OD/OC coarse segmentation and the heatmap localization of fovea
through a joint segmentation and detection module. Afterwards, we crop the
regions of interest for subsequent fine processing and use predictions obtained
at the coarse stage as additional information for better performance and faster
convergence. Experimental results reveal that our proposed JOINED outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches on the publicly-available GAMMA, PALM, and
REFUGE datasets of fundus images. Furthermore, JOINED ranked the 5th on the
OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection tasks in the GAMMA challenge hosted by
the MICCAI2021 workshop OMIA8.

Kirchhoff's laws. Whenever small and abundant loops in factor graphs are
systematically generated by constraints between variables in the original

provides a fast and reliable algorithm to perform marginalization in tasks like
state determination, estimation, or optimization issues in supply networks.

more detail. We found that most of the plasma in the NPS/Loop I favors the
state of NEI, and has the density-weighted ionization timescale of $n_e
t\sim10^{11-12}$ s cm$^{-3}$ and the electron number density $n_e\sim$ a few
$\times$ 10$^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$. The plasma shock age, $t$, or the time elapsed
after the shock front passed through the plasma, is estimated to be on the
order of a few $\rm{Myr}$ for the NPS/Loop I, which puts a strict lower limit
to the age of the whole NPS/Loop I structure. We found that NEI results in
significantly higher temperature and lower emission measure than those
currently derived under CIE assumption. The electron temperature under NEI is
estimated to be as high as 0.5 keV toward the brightest X-ray NPS ridge at
$\Delta\theta=-20^\circ$, which decreases to 0.3 keV at $-10^\circ$, and again
increases to $\sim 0.6$ keV towards the outer edge of Loop I at

optimization strategy to estimate clean spectrum stage by stage. Specifically,
the low- (0-8 kHz), middle- (8-16 kHz), and high-frequency (16-24 kHz) regions
are mapped by three separate sub-networks and are then fused to obtain the
full-band clean target STFT spectrum. Comprehensive experiments on two public

the diagnostic SN properties by employing the hydrodynamic explosion model of a
9 MSun red supergiant progenitor with an iron core and a pre-collapse mass of
8.75 Msun. The explosion of the star was obtained by the neutrino-driven
mechanism in a fully self-consistent simulation in three dimensions (3D).
Multi-band light curves and photospheric velocities for the plateau phase are
computed with the one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics code STELLA, applied
to the spherically averaged 3D explosion model as well as spherisized radial
profiles in different directions of the 3D model. We find that the overall
evolution of the bolometric light curve, duration of the plateau phase, and
basic properties of the multi-band emission can be well reproduced by our SN
model with its explosion energy of only 0.7x10^50 erg and an ejecta mass of 7.4
Msun. These values are considerably lower than the previously reported numbers,
but they are compatible with those needed to explain the fundamental
observational properties of the prototype low-luminosity SN 2005cs. Because of
the good compatibility of our photospheric velocities with line velocities
determined for SN 2005cs, we conclude that the line velocities of SN 2020cxd
are probably overestimated by up to a factor of about 3. The evolution of the
line velocities of SN 2005cs compared to photospheric velocities in different
explosion directions might point to intrinsic asymmetries in the SN ejecta.

implies that any linear dynamical system can be stabilized from fewer observed

captured data (i.e. the shared gradients) and do not exploit the data the
adversary themselves control as part of the training consortium. In this work,
we propose a novel model inversion framework that builds on the foundations of
gradient-based model inversion attacks, but additionally relies on matching the
features and the style of the reconstructed image to data that is controlled by
an adversary. Our technique outperforms existing gradient-based approaches both
qualitatively and quantitatively, while still maintaining the same
honest-but-curious threat model, allowing the adversary to obtain enhanced
reconstructions while remaining concealed.

have recently become a focus area of software engineering research. While this
research focus has been met with some enthusiastic endorsement from industry,
prior work nevertheless mostly studied flakiness using a code-centric approach
by mining software repositories. What data extracted from software repositories
cannot tell us, however, is how developers perceive flakiness: How prevalent is
test flakiness in developers' daily routine, how does it affect them, and most
importantly: What do they want us researchers to do about it? To answer these
questions, we surveyed 335 professional software developers and testers in
different domains. The survey respondents confirm that flaky tests are a common
and serious problem, thus reinforcing ongoing research on flaky test detection.
Developers are less worried about the computational costs caused by re-running
tests and more about the loss of trust in the test outcomes. Therefore, they
would like to have IDE plugins to detect flaky code as well as better
visualizations of the problem, particularly dashboards showing test outcomes
over time; they also wish for more training and information on flakiness. These
important aspects will require the attention of researchers as well as tool
developers.

non-verbal communication. However, controlling the motions of a robotic eye
that display similar performance as the human oculomotor system is still a
major challenge. In this paper, we study how to control a realistic model of
the human eye with a cable-driven actuation system that mimics the six degrees
of freedom of the extra-ocular muscles. The biomimetic design introduces novel
challenges to address, most notably the need to control the pretension on each
individual muscle to prevent the loss of tension during motion, that would lead
to cable slack and lack of control. We built a robotic prototype and developed
a nonlinear simulator and two controllers. In the first approach, we linearized
the nonlinear model, using a local derivative technique, and designed
linear-quadratic optimal controllers to optimize a cost function that accounts
for accuracy, energy expenditure, and movement duration. The second method uses
a recurrent neural network that learns the nonlinear system dynamics from
sample trajectories of the system, and a non-linear trajectory optimization
solver that minimizes a similar cost function. We focused on the generation of
rapid saccadic eye movements with fully unconstrained kinematics, and the
generation of control signals for the six cables that simultaneously satisfied
several dynamic optimization criteria. The model faithfully mimics the
three-dimensional rotational kinematics and dynamics observed for human
saccades. Our experimental results indicate that while both methods yielded

computing. Accurate future population prediction can provide rich insights for
urban planners or developers. However, predicting the future population is a
challenging task due to its complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Many existing
works have attempted to capture spatial correlations by partitioning a city
into grids and using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, CNN merely
captures spatial correlations by using a rectangle filter; it ignores urban
environmental information such as distribution of railroads and location of
POI. Moreover, the importance of those kinds of information for population
prediction differs in each region and is affected by contextual situations such
as weather conditions and day of the week. To tackle this problem, we propose a
novel deep learning model called Attention-based Contextual Multi-View Graph
Convolutional Networks (ACMV-GCNs). We first construct multiple graphs based on
urban environmental information, and then ACMV-GCNs captures spatial
correlations from various views with graph convolutional networks. Further, we
add an attention module to consider the contextual situations when leveraging
urban environmental information for future population prediction. Using
statistics population count data collected through mobile phones, we
demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms baseline methods. In addition,
by visualizing weights calculated by an attention module, we show that our
model learns an efficient way to utilize urban environment information without
any prior knowledge.

analyze the statefinder parameters, $\omega'{}_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ plots, and
classical stability features of the model. The results state that the
deceleration parameter provides the phase transition from decelerated to
accelerated phase. The $\omega_{DE}$ graphs show the phantom behavior, while
the $\omega_{tot}$ exhibits the quintessence and phantom during the evolution
of the Universe. Following the graphs, the Statefinder analysis shows the
quintessence behavior of the model for the past and present. However, it tends
to the $\Lambda CDM$ in the following era. The $\omega'{}_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$
plot indicates the thawing or freezing area depending on the type of era and
different values of $b^{2}$, $\delta$, and $m$. By the square of the sound
speed, we see the model is stable in the past, stable or unstable at the
current time, and unstable in the future for selected values of $b^{2}$,
$\delta$, and $m$. To test the model, we use the recent Hubble data. We also
employ Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) to compare the model with the $\Lambda CDM$ as the reference model. In
addition, we test the model using the $H-z$ plot, and we see a turning point in
the future time. The results from the best fit values for the $\omega_{tot}$
plot emphasize that the Universe is in the quintessence region in the current
time. It will enter the phantom phase, and then it will approach the $\Lambda$
state in the future. But, the $\omega_{DE}$ always stays on the phantom region.
The model is unstable in the present and progressive era.

Fermi surfaces and the saddle points, many interesting orders are expected.
Here, we report the observation of superconductivity by pressurizing a kagome
compound Rb$_2$Pd$_3$Se$_4$ using a DAC anvil. The parent compound shows an
insulating behavior; however, it gradually becomes metallic and turns to a
superconducting state when a high pressure is applied. High pressure
synchrotron measurements show that there is no structural transition occurring
during this transition. The density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations
illustrate that the insulating behavior of the parent phase is due to the
crystalline field splitting of the partial Pd-4d $t_{2g}$ bands and the
Se-derivative 4$p$-band. However, the threshold of metallicity and
superconductivity are reached when the Lifshitz transition occurs, leading to
the emergence of tiny Fermi surface at $\Gamma$ point. Our results point to an
unconventional superconductivity and shed new light on understanding the

age, heart disease, average glucose level, and hypertension are the most
important factors for detecting stroke in patients. Furthermore, a perceptron
neural network using these four attributes provides the highest accuracy rate
and lowest miss rate compared to using all available input features and other
benchmarking algorithms. As the dataset is highly imbalanced concerning the
occurrence of stroke, we report our results on a balanced dataset created via

experiences, which are key characteristics that help participants to advance
technical work. Several specific issues are faced and need to be solved when
running online coding camps, which can achieve the same level of positive
outcomes for participants. One of such issues is how to keep the same level of
fun that participants obtained through physical activities and interactions in
the face-to-face settings. In this paper, we report on our experience and
insights gained from designing and running a fully remote coding camp that
exposes high school students to Agile-based Software Engineering practices to
enhance their ability to develop high-quality software. To design the online
coding camp, we adapted the face-to-face version of the coding camp to keep the
same ""level of fun"", i.e., adaptations aimed at increasing communication,
engaging participants, and introducing fun items to reduce fatigue due to
prolonged computer use, while preserving the technical curriculum that enables
students to attain the learning goals originally planned. The comparison with
the results of the face-to-face coding camp shows that we succeeded in keeping
the fun alive in the online edition, and the participants of online camp were
able to produce the results at the same level of quality in terms of product
and process as in the face-to-face edition. From our experience, we synthesize
lessons learned, and we sketch some guidelines for educators.

system of two normal metal (NM) leads connected to a superconductor (SC) that
converts the electron like excitations in one metallic lead into hole like
excitations in the other metallic lead. The scattering phenomena viz. electron
tunneling (ET), electron reflection (ER) and Andreev reflection (AR) compete
with CAR and reduce the probability of CAR generically. One of the
experimentally realized proposals to observe CAR is to employ two ferromagnetic
(FM) leads in antiparallel configuration connected to the SC by suppressing ET
and AR. But CAR probability cannot be tuned in this setup. We propose a setup
consisting of a gate tunable NM region connected to two superconducting regions
on either side which are connected to FM leads further away in antiparallel
configuration, in which probabilities of CAR and ER can be changed from $0$ to
$1$ by a changing the gate voltage applied to the NM region. The gate voltage
applied to the NM region dictates the chemical potential of the NM region and
gives a handle on the Fabry-P\'erot interference of the electron and hole modes
in the NM region. We calculate differential transconductance for the proposed
setup which can be tuned across the range $0$ to $-e^2/h$.

re-analyse Li/C, Be/C, and B/C AMS-02 data. We built three equally plausible
cross-section sets. Compared to the initial cross-section sets, they lead to an
average enhanced production of Li ($\sim20-50\%$) and Be ($\sim5-15\%$), while
leaving the B flux mostly unchanged. In particular, Fe fragmentation is found
to contribute to up to 10\% of the Li and Be fluxes. Used in the combined
analysis of AMS-02 Li/C, Be/C, and B/C data, the fit is significantly improved,
with an enhanced diffusion coefficient ($\sim 20\%)$. The three updated
cross-section sets are found to either slightly undershoot or overshoot the
Li/C and B/C ratios: this strongly disfavours evidence for a primary source of
Li in cosmic rays. We stress that isotopic cosmic-ray ratios of Li (and to a
lesser extent Be), soon to be released by AMS-02, are also impacted by the use
of these updated sets. Almost no nuclear data exist for the production of Li

to account for $\sim 20\%$ of the total production. New nuclear measurements

out-of-distribution generation to avoid spurious sample generation, thereby
limiting their creativity. Thus, incorporating research on human creativity
into generative deep learning techniques presents an opportunity to make their
outputs more compelling and human-like. As we see the emergence of generative
models directed toward creativity research, a need for machine learning-based
surrogate metrics to characterize creative output from these models is
imperative. We propose group-based subset scanning to identify, quantify, and
characterize creative processes by detecting a subset of anomalous
node-activations in the hidden layers of the generative models. Our experiments
on the standard image benchmarks, and their ""creatively generated"" variants,
reveal that the proposed subset scores distribution is more useful for
detecting creative processes in the activation space rather than the pixel
space. Further, we found that creative samples generate larger subsets of
anomalies than normal or non-creative samples across datasets. The node
activations highlighted during the creative decoding process are different from
those responsible for the normal sample generation. Lastly, we assess if the
images from the subsets selected by our method were also found creative by
human evaluators, presenting a link between creativity perception in humans and
node activations within deep neural nets.

rotating black holes in these theories are likely to not have a fourth constant

phase space present chaotic features that will affect the inspiral of small
compact objects into supermassive black holes in these theories. Nevertheless,
the characteristic size of these chaotic features is tiny and their location in

split-operator KSL (TT-SOKSL) method for quantum simulations in tensor-train
(TT)/matrix product state (MPS) representations. TT-SOKSL propagates the
quantum state as a tensor train using the Trotter expansion of the
time-evolution operator, as in the tensor-train split-operator Fourier
transform (TT-SOFT) method. However, the exponential operators of the Trotter
expansion are applied using a rank adaptive TT-KSL scheme instead of using the
scaling and squaring approach as in TT-SOFT. We demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of TT-SOKSL as applied to simulations of the photoisomerization of
the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin, including non-adiabatic dynamics at a
conical intersection of potential energy surfaces. The quantum evolution is
described in full dimensionality by a time-dependent wavepacket evolving
according to a two-state 25-dimensional model Hamiltonian. We find that
TT-SOKSL converges faster than TT-SOFT with respect to the maximally allowed
memory requirement of the tensor-train representation and better preserves the
norm of the time-evolving state. When compared to the corresponding simulations
based on the TT-KSL method, TT-SOKSL has the advantage of avoiding the need of
constructing the matrix product state Laplacian by exploiting the linear
scaling of multidimensional tensor train Fourier transforms.

interpretable DR mappings in the form of symbolic expressions. There exists a
number of ways in which GP can be used to this end and no study exists that
performs a comparison. In this paper, we fill this gap by comparing existing GP
methods as well as devising new ones. We evaluate our methods on several
benchmark datasets based on predictive accuracy and on how well the original

Finally, we qualitatively assess the resulting expressions and their

phase of the early universe before the electroweak phase transition. The
behavior of HMFs is driven by the analog of the chiral magnetic effect
accounting for the asymmetries of leptons and Higgs bosons. These asymmetries
are also dynamical variables of the model and evolve together with HMFs.
Moreover, we account for the contribution of the hyper-MHD turbulence in the
effective diffusion coefficient and the $\alpha$-dynamo parameter. The
realistic spectrum of seed HMFs consists of two branches: Batchelor and
Kolmogorov ones. The impact of HMFs on the production of relic gravitational
waves (GWs) and the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU), as well as flavor
oscillations of supernova neutrinos in the stochastic GWs generated, are
considered. We establish the constraint on the strength of the seed HMF
comparing the spectral density of produced GWs with the observations of the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. The stronger upper bound on the seed HMF is
obtained from the condition of not exceeding the observed value of BAU.

deuteron and the angular dependence of the double polarisation observable $E$
for the quasi-free single $\pi^0$ production off the proton and the neutron
have been measured for the first time from the threshold region up to the

facility of the MAMI accelerator and used a circularly polarised photon beam
and longitudinally polarised deuteron target. The reaction products were
detected using the large acceptance Crystal Ball/TAPS calorimeter, which
covered 97% of the full solid angle.
  Comparing the cross section from the deuteron with the sum of free nucleon
cross sections provides a quantitative estimate of the effects of the nuclear
medium on pion production. In contrast, comparison of $E$ helicity asymmetry
data from quasi-free protons off deuterium with data from a free proton target
indicates that nuclear effects do not significantly affect this observable. As
a consequence, it is deduced that the helicity asymmetry $E$ on a free neutron
can be reliably extracted from measurements on a deuteron in quasi-free
kinematics.

topologically non-trivial properties survive at finite temperatures and, if so,
whether they disappear only at the temperature of topological gap closing.
Here, we study this problem, using quantum fidelity as a measure, by means of
\emph{ab-initio} methods supplemented by an effective dissipative theory built
on the top of the \emph{ab-initio} electron and phonon band structures. In the
case of SnTe, the prototypical crystal topological insulator, we reveal the
presence of a characteristic temperature, much lower than the gap-closing one,
that marks a loss of coherence of the topological state. The transition is not
present in a purely electronic system but it appears once we invoke coupling
with a dissipative bosonic bath. Features in the dependence with temperature of
the fidelity susceptibility can be related to changes in the band curvature,
but signatures of a topological phase transition appear in the fidelity only
though the non-adiabatic coupling with soft phonons. Our argument is valid for
valley topological insulators, but in principle can be generalized to the
broader class of topological insulators which host any symmetry-breaking boson.

been extensively studied. With the surgence of deep learning and large-scale
pre-training techniques, various neural information retrieval models are
proposed and they have demonstrated the power for improving search (especially,
the ranking) quality. All these existing search methods follow a common
paradigm, i.e. index-retrieve-rerank, where they first build an index of all
documents based on document terms (i.e., sparse inverted index) or
representation vectors (i.e., dense vector index), then retrieve and rerank
retrieved documents based on similarity between the query and documents via
ranking models. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm of information
retrieval with neither sparse nor dense index but only a model. Specifically,
we propose a pre-training model-based IR system called DynamicRetriever. As for
this system, the training stage embeds the token-level and document-level
information (especially, document identifiers) of the corpus into the model
parameters, then the inference stage directly generates document identifiers
for a given query. Compared with existing search methods, the model-based IR
system has two advantages: i) it parameterizes the traditional static index
with a pre-training model, which converts the document semantic mapping into a
dynamic and updatable process; ii) with separate document identifiers, it
captures both the term-level and document-level information for each document.
Extensive experiments conducted on the public search benchmark MS MARCO verify
the effectiveness and potential of our proposed new paradigm for information
retrieval.

with large problem spaces. State representations serve both to approximate the
value function with few parameters, but also to generalize to newly encountered
states. Their features may be learned implicitly (as part of a neural network)
or explicitly (for example, the successor representation of
\citet{dayan1993improving}). While the approximation properties of
representations are reasonably well-understood, a precise characterization of
how and when these representations generalize is lacking. In this work, we
address this gap and provide an informative bound on the generalization error
arising from a specific state representation. This bound is based on the notion
of effective dimension which measures the degree to which knowing the value at
one state informs the value at other states. Our bound applies to any state
representation and quantifies the natural tension between representations that
generalize well and those that approximate well. We complement our theoretical
results with an empirical survey of classic representation learning methods

that the generalization behaviour of learned representations is well-explained

Education (NYC DOE) to increase the number of admissions of students from low
socio-economic background to specialized high schools. This policy has been
instrumental in increasing the number of disadvantaged students attending these
schools. However, assuming that students care more about the school they are
assigned to rather than the type of seat they occupy (\emph{school-over-seat
hypothesis}), our empirical analysis using data from 12 recent academic years
shows that DISC creates about 950 in-group blocking pairs each year amongst
disadvantaged students, impacting about 650 disadvantaged students every year.
Moreover, we find that this program does not respect improvements, thus
unintentionally creating an incentive to under-perform. These experimental
results are confirmed by our theoretical analysis.
  In order to alleviate the concerns caused by DISC, we explore two alternative
policies: the minority reserve (MR) and the joint-seat allocation (JSA)
mechanisms. As our main theoretical contribution, we introduce a feature of
markets, that we term high competitiveness, and we show that under this
condition, JSA dominates MR for all disadvantaged students. We give sufficient
conditions under which high competitiveness is verified. Data from NYC DOE
satisfies the high competitiveness condition, and for this dataset our
empirical results corroborate our theoretical predictions, showing the
superiority of JSA. Given that JSA can be implemented by a simple modification
of the classical deferred acceptance algorithm with responsive preference
lists, we believe that, when the school-over-seat hypothesis holds, the
discovery program can be changed for the better by implementing the JSA
mechanism, leading in particular to aligned incentives for the top-performing
disadvantaged students.

to learn a unitary transformation efficiently is a fundamental problem in
quantum machine learning. The most natural and leading strategy is to train a
quantum machine learning model based on a quantum dataset. Although the
presence of more training data results in better models, using too much data
reduces the efficiency of training. In this work, we solve the problem on the
minimum size of sufficient quantum datasets for learning a unitary
transformation exactly, which reveals the power and limitation of quantum data.
First, we prove that the minimum size of a dataset with pure states is $2^n$
for learning an $n$-qubit unitary transformation. To fully explore the
capability of quantum data, we introduce a practical quantum dataset consisting
of $n+1$ elementary tensor product states that are sufficient for exact
training. The main idea is to simplify the structure utilizing decoupling,
which leads to an exponential improvement in the size of the datasets with pure
states. Furthermore, we show that the size of the quantum dataset with mixed
states can be reduced to a constant, which yields an optimal quantum dataset
for learning a unitary. We showcase the applications of our results in oracle
compiling and Hamiltonian simulation. Notably, to accurately simulate a 3-qubit
one-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg model, our circuit only uses $96$

the Internet. Search engines, social networks, content delivery and retail and
e-commerce sites belong to this group of applications. An important element in
the architecture of data centers where these applications run is the
communication infrastructure, commonly known as data center networks (DCNs). A
critical challenge DCNs have to address is the processing of the traffic of
cloud applications, which due to its properties is essentially different to the
traffic of other Internet applications. In order to improve the responsiveness
and throughput of applications, DCNs should be able to prioritize short flows
(a few KB) over long flows (several MB). However, given the time and space
variations the traffic presents, the information about flow sizes is not
available in advance in order to plan the flow scheduling. In this paper, we
present an adaptable mechanism called Adaptable Workload-Agnostic Flow
Scheduling (AWAFS). It is an adaptable approach that can adjust in an agnostic
way the scheduling configuration of DCN forwarding devices. This agnostic
adjustment contributes to reduce the Flow Completion Time (FCT) of those short
flows, representing around 85% of the traffic handled by cloud applications.
Our evaluation results based on simulation show that AWAFS can reduce the
average FCT of short flows between 16.9% and 45.2% when compared to the best
existing agnostic non-adaptable solution, without inducing starvation on long
flows. Indeed, it can provide improvements as high as 39% for long flows.
Additionally, AWAFS can improve the FCT for short flows in scenarios with high
heterogeneity in the traffic present in the network, with a reduction up to 5%
for the average FCT and 15% for the tail FCT.

  Given a multivariate signal, the algorithm $MPE_G$ involves two main steps:
1) we construct an underlying graph G as the Cartesian product of two graphs G1

often vulnerable to adversarial examples and distribution shifts, limiting
model generalization ability in real-world applications. To alleviate these
problems, recent approaches leverage distributional robustness optimization
(DRO) to find the most challenging distribution, and then minimize loss
function over this most challenging distribution. Regardless of achieving some
improvements, these DRO approaches have some obvious limitations. First, they
purely focus on local regularization to strengthen model robustness, missing a
global regularization effect which is useful in many real-world applications
(e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization, and adversarial machine
learning). Second, the loss functions in the existing DRO approaches operate in
only the most challenging distribution, hence decouple with the original
distribution, leading to a restrictive modeling capability. In this paper, we
propose a novel regularization technique, following the veins of
Wasserstein-based DRO framework. Specifically, we define a particular joint
distribution and Wasserstein-based uncertainty, allowing us to couple the
original and most challenging distributions for enhancing modeling capability

cosmological simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies. We perform a differential
analysis with the goal of understanding how each of the updates affects star
cluster populations. Two key parameters are the momentum boost of supernova
feedback $f_{\mathrm{boost}}$ and star formation efficiency per freefall time
$\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$. We find that $f_{\mathrm{boost}}$ has a strong
influence on the galactic star formation rate, with higher values leading to
less star formation. The efficiency $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ does not have a
significant impact on the global star formation rate, but dramatically changes
cluster properties, with increasing $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ff}}$ leading to a
higher maximum cluster mass, shorter age spread of stars within clusters, and
higher integrated star formation efficiencies. We also explore the redshift
evolution of the observable cluster mass function, finding that most massive
clusters have formed at high redshift $z>4$. Extrapolation of cluster
disruption to $z=0$ produces good agreement with both the Galactic globular
cluster mass function and age-metallicity relation. Our results emphasize the

matrix formalism to treat each layer as the propagating matrix. The crucial
idea is to expand the propagating matrix of the resonant atomic layer under
ultrathin-film approximation, then derive the analytical expression of the
spectral observation, i.e, the cavity reflectance. The typical cavity effects
of cavity enhanced decay rate, cavity induced energy shift and the Fano
interference which were observed in the recent experiments could be
phenomenologically interpreted. The second quantum model employs the analytical
Green's function to solve the cavity system. The system Hamiltonian and the
effective energy-level are derived. The effective energy-level scheme indicates
that the cavity effect acts on the regulation of the intermediated core-hole
state. To test the validity of the semi-classical matrix and quantum Green's
function models, the classical Parratt's formalism and the dispersion
correction of the atomic refractive index are also recalled. Very good
agreements in reflectivity spectra between semi-classical and quantum models

map a constellation to a descriptor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
Deep Learned Constellation Descriptor (Descriptellation) on two real-world

Descriptellation also outperforms state-of-the-art and handcrafted

polar Fr\""ohlich coupling have advanced considerably in recent years. The
Fr\""ohlich electron-phonon matrix element is by now well understood in the case
of bulk three-dimensional (3D) materials. In the case of two-dimensional (2D)
materials, the standard procedure to include Fr\""ohlich coupling is to employ
Coulomb truncation, so as to eliminate artificial interactions between periodic
images of the 2D layer. While these techniques are well established, the
transition of the Fr\""ohlich coupling from three to two dimensions has not been
investigated. Furthermore, it remains unclear what error one makes when
describing 2D systems using the standard bulk formalism in a periodic supercell
geometry. Here, we generalize previous work on the \textit{ab initio}
Fr\""ohlich electron-phonon matrix element in bulk materials by investigating
the electrostatic potential of atomic dipoles in a periodic supercell
consisting of a 2D material and a continuum dielectric slab. We obtain a
unified expression for the matrix element, which reduces to the existing
formulas for 3D and 2D systems when the interlayer separation tends to zero or
infinity, respectively. This new expression enables an accurate description of
the Fr\""ohlich matrix element in 2D systems without resorting to Coulomb
truncation. We validate our approach by direct \textit{ab initio}
density-functional perturbation theory calculations for monolayer BN and
MoS$_2$, and we provide a simple expression for the 2D Fr\""ohlich matrix
element that can be used in model Hamiltonian approaches. The formalism
outlined in this work may find applications in calculations of polarons,
quasiparticle renormalization, transport coefficients, and superconductivity,
in 2D and quasi-2D materials.

parameters of unresolved extragalactic Globular Clusters is through the study
of their integrated spectroscopy, where Balmer line-strength indices are

spectral line-strength index H$\beta_o$ was observed in a sample of Galactic
globular clusters at all metallicities resulting in an apparent ""upper branch""
and ""lower branch"" of globular clusters in the H$\beta_o$ - [MgFe] diagram.
This was suggested to be caused by the presence of hot Blue straggler stars
(BSSs), resulting in an underestimation of 'spectroscopic' ages in the upper
branch. Over a decade on, we look to re-evaluate these findings. We make use of
new, large Galactic Globular Cluster integrated spectroscopy datasets. To
produce a large, homogeneously combined sample we have considered a number of
factors including the radial dependence of Balmer and metal lines. Using this
new sample, in disagreement with previous work, we find the splitting in
H$\beta_o$ only occurs at intermediate to high metallicities ([M/H]$>-1$), and
is not the result of an increased fraction of BSSs, but rather is due to an
increased Helium abundance. We explore the possible impact of varying Helium on
simple stellar population models to provide a theoretical basis for our
hypothesis and then use the relationship between upper branch candidacy and
enhanced Helium to predict the Helium content of three M31 clusters. We discuss
what this can tell us about their mass and fraction of first generation stars.

optimal strong convergence order $1$ of the numerical solution. Further, we
propose a novel localization argument to estimate the total variation distance

the density of the numerical solution finally yields the convergence of density
in $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ of the numerical solution. This partially answers

matter (DM) and gravity in the dynamics of local spiral galaxies. In
particular, we consider a theoretically motivated NMC that may arise
dynamically from the collective behavior of the coarse-grained DM field (e.g.,
via Bose-Einstein condensation) with averaging/coherence length $L$. In the
Newtonian limit, this NMC amounts to modify the Poisson equation by a term
$L^{2} \nabla^{2} \rho$ proportional to the Laplacian of the DM density itself.
We show that such a term, when acting as a perturbation over the standard
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile of cold DM particles, can substantially alter
the dynamical properties of galaxies, in terms of their total radial
acceleration within the disk and rotation velocity. Specifically, we find that
this NMC model can properly fit the stacked rotation curves of local spiral
galaxies with different velocities at the optical radius, including dwarfs and
low-surface brightness systems, at a level of precision comparable to, and in
some instances even better than, the phenomenological Burkert profile. Finally
we show that, extrapolating down to smaller masses the scaling of $L$ vs. halo
mass found from the above rotation curve analysis, the NMC model can adequately
reproduce the radial acceleration relation (or RAR) in shape and normalization
down to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy range, a task which constitutes a serious
challenge for alternative DM models even inclusive of baryonic effects.

which all layers are trained, we provide a detailed characterization of the

both models display sample-wise double-descent behavior in the presence of
label noise. Random feature models can also display model-wise double-descent
if there are narrow bottleneck layers, while deep networks do not show these

dielectric response over the short length scales of interfacial heterogeneity.
Here we circumvent this problem for thin water films by adopting a
thermodynamic approach. Using molecular simulations, we calculate the solvent's
contribution to the reversible work of charging a parallel plate capacitor. We
find good agreement with a simple dielectric continuum model that assumes bulk
dielectric permittivity all the way up to the liquid's boundary, even for very
thin ($\sim 1$ nm) films. This comparison requires careful attention to the
placement of dielectric boundaries between liquid and vapor, which also
resolves apparent discrepancies with dielectric imaging experiments.

approaches access 3D information by scanning the sample with respect to the
X-ray source. However, the scanning process limits the temporal resolution when
studying dynamics and is not feasible for some applications, such as surgical
guidance in medical applications. Alternatives to obtaining 3D information when
scanning is not possible are X-ray stereoscopy and multi-projection imaging.
However, these approaches suffer from limited volumetric information as they
only acquire a small number of views or projections compared to traditional 3D
scanning techniques. Here, we present ONIX (Optimized Neural Implicit X-ray
imaging), a deep-learning algorithm capable of retrieving 3D objects with
arbitrary large resolution from only a set of sparse projections. ONIX,
although it does not have access to any volumetric information, outperforms
current 3D reconstruction approaches because it includes the physics of image
formation with X-rays, and it generalizes across different experiments over
similar samples to overcome the limited volumetric information provided by
sparse views. We demonstrate the capabilities of ONIX compared to
state-of-the-art tomographic reconstruction algorithms by applying it to
simulated and experimental datasets, where a maximum of eight projections are
acquired. We anticipate that ONIX will become a crucial tool for the X-ray
community by i) enabling the study of fast dynamics not possible today when
implemented together with X-ray multi-projection imaging, and ii) enhancing the
volumetric information and capabilities of X-ray stereoscopic imaging in

DHRN) is proposed for analyzing valves acoustic signals. Firstly, a data
augmentation method based on sliding window with fast Fourier transform
(Swin-FFT) is developed to alleviate the small-sample issue confronted in this
study. Secondly, a 1-D double hierarchical residual block (1-D DHRB) is
constructed to capture sensitive features from the frequency domain acoustic
signals of valve. Then, a new structure of 1-D DHRN is proposed. Finally, the
devised 1-D DHRN is evaluated on two datasets of valve acoustic signals without
noise (Dataset 1 and Dataset 2) and one dataset of valve acoustic signals with
realistic surrounding noise (Dataset 3) provided by SAMSON AG (Frankfurt). Our
method has achieved state-of-the-art results. The prediction accurcies of 1-D
DHRN for cavitation intensitys recognition are as high as 93.75%, 94.31% and
100%, which indicates that 1-D DHRN outperforms other DL models and
conventional methods. At the same time, the testing accuracies of 1-D DHRN for
cavitation detection are as high as 97.02%, 97.64% and 100%. In addition, 1-D
DHRN has also been tested for different frequencies of samples and shows
excellent results for frequency of samples that mobile phones can accommodate.

using Markov chain Monte Carlo based methods since these rely on local
operations. And although more recent variational inference (VI) based methods
offer speed improvements, they rely on expensive auto-differentiation
operations for learning the variational parameters. We propose VaiPhy, a
remarkably fast VI based algorithm for approximate posterior inference in an
augmented tree space. VaiPhy produces marginal log-likelihood estimates on par
with the state-of-the-art methods on real data and is considerably faster since
it does not require auto-differentiation. Instead, VaiPhy combines coordinate
ascent update equations with two novel sampling schemes: (i) SLANTIS, a
proposal distribution for tree topologies in the augmented tree space, and (ii)
the JC sampler, to the best of our knowledge, the first-ever scheme for
sampling branch lengths directly from the popular Jukes-Cantor model. We
compare VaiPhy in terms of density estimation and runtime. Additionally, we

interest in developing novel neuromorphic hardware, including photonic
integrated circuits. Although an optical waveguide can accommodate hundreds of
channels with THz bandwidth, the channel count of photonic systems is always
bottlenecked by the devices within. In WDM-based photonic neural networks, the
synapses, i.e. network interconnections, are typically realized by microring
resonators (MRRs), where the WDM channel count (N) is bounded by the
free-spectral range of the MRRs. For typical Si MRRs, we estimate N <= 30
within the C-band. This not only restrains the aggregate throughput of the
neural network but also makes applications with high input dimensions
unfeasible. We experimentally demonstrate that photonic crystal nanobeam based
synapses can be FSR-free within C-band, eliminating the bound on channel count.
This increases data throughput as well as enables applications with
high-dimensional inputs like natural language processing and high resolution

in a broader problem of the effect of a timing error in cyber-physical systems.
These systems rely on the requirement that certain things happen at the same

these systems get more complex, timing errors can occur between the components
thereby violating the assumption about events being simultaneous (or periodic).
  We consider the problem of a surgical navigation system where optical markers
detected in the 2D pictures taken by two cameras are used to localize the
markers in 3D space. A predefined array of such markers, known as a reference
element, is used to navigate the corresponding CAD model of a surgical

pictures from both cameras are taken exactly at the same time. If a timing
error occurs then the instrument may have moved between the pictures. We find
that, depending upon the location of the instrument, this can lead to a
substantial error in the localization of the instrument. Specifically, we find
that if the actual movement is $\delta$ then the observed movement may be as
high as $5\delta$ in the operating range of the camera. Furthermore, we also
identify potential issues that could affect the error in case there are changes

dark energy is still an open question. In General Relativity Theory, the
simplest explanation for dark energy is the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.
However, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ facing a sensitive problem called
fine-tunning problem. In the present work, we follow a different approach where
the gravitational sector is the responsible candidate for the evolution of dark
energy instead of the matter source. The modified symmetric teleparallel
gravity or $f(Q)$ gravity is a recently proposed theory of gravity where the
gravitational interaction ruled by the non-metricity term $Q$. In this
manuscript, we assume a $f(Q)$ model that contains a linear and a non-linear
form of non-metricity scalar, particularly $f(Q)=\alpha Q + \beta Q^n$, where
$\alpha$, $\beta$, and $n$ are free model parameters. Then we find the values
of our model parameters that would be in agreement with the observed value of
cosmographic parameters. We analyze the behavior of different cosmological
parameters like deceleration parameter, density, and the equation of state
parameter with the energy conditions for our cosmological model. We found that
for higher positive values of $n$ specifically $n \geq 1$, dark energy fluid
part evolving due to non-metricity behaves like quintessence type dark energy
while for higher negative values of $n$ specifically $n \leq -1$ it follows
phantom scenario. Further for $n=0$, our cosmological $f(Q)$ model behaves like
$\Lambda$CDM model. Thus, we conclude that the geometrical generalization of GR
can be a viable candidate for the description of origin of the dark energy.

inherent attosecond temporal resolution, which has been applied successfully to
a broad variety of systems in the gas phase and solid state. Here, we extend
HHS to the liquid phase, and uncover the mechanism of high-harmonic generation
(HHG) for this phase of matter. Studying HHG over a broad range of wavelengths
and intensities, we show that the cut-off ($E_c$) is independent of the
wavelength beyond a threshold intensity, and find that $E_c$ is a
characteristic property of the studied liquid. We explain these observations
within an intuitive semi-classical model based on electron trajectories that
are limited by scattering to a characteristic length, which is connected to the
electron mean-free path. Our model is validated against rigorous multi-electron
time-dependent density-functional theory calculations in, both, supercells of
liquid water with periodic boundary conditions, and large clusters of a variety
of liquids. These simulations confirm our interpretation and thereby clarify
the mechanism of HHG in liquids. Our results demonstrate a new, all-optical
access to effective mean-free paths of slow electrons ($\leq$10 eV) in liquids,
in a regime that is inaccessible to accurate calculations, but is critical for
the understanding of radiation damage to living tissue. Our work also
establishes the possibility of resolving sub-femtosecond electron dynamics in

Many solutions have been designed in the literature. The deterministic input,
noisy ""and"" gate (DINA) model is a classical cognitive diagnosis model and can
provide interpretable cognitive parameters, e.g., student vectors. However, the
assumption of the probabilistic part of DINA is too strong, because it assumes
that the slip and guess rates of questions are student-independent. Besides,
the question matrix (i.e., Q-matrix) recording the skill distribution of the
questions in the cognitive diagnosis domain often requires precise labels given
by domain experts. Thus, we propose an explicit student vector estimation
(ESVE) method to estimate the student vectors of DINA with a local
self-consistent test, which does not rely on any assumptions for the
probabilistic part of DINA. Then, based on the estimated student vectors, the
probabilistic part of DINA can be modified to a student dependent model that
the slip and guess rates are related to student vectors. Furthermore, we
propose an unsupervised method called heuristic bidirectional calibration
algorithm (HBCA) to label the Q-matrix automatically, which connects the
question difficulty relation and the answer results for initialization and uses
the fault tolerance of ESVE-DINA for calibration. The experimental results on
two real-world datasets show that ESVE-DINA outperforms the DINA model on
accuracy and that the Q-matrix labeled automatically by HBCA can achieve
performance comparable to that obtained with the manually labeled Q-matrix when
using the same model structure.

  Optimization","16 pages, 12 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To facilitate the antenna design with the aid of computer, one of the
practices in consumer electronic industry is to model and optimize antenna
performances with a simplified antenna geometric scheme. Traditional antenna
modeling requires profound prior knowledge of electromagnetics in order to
achieve a good design which satisfies the performance specifications from both
antenna and product designs. The ease of handling multidimensional optimization
problems and the less dependence on domain knowledge and experience are the key
to achieve the popularity of simulation driven antenna design and optimization
for the industry. In this paper, we introduce a flexible geometric scheme with
the concept of mesh network that can form any arbitrary shape by connecting
different nodes. For such problems with high dimensional parameters, we propose
a machine learning based generative method to assist the searching of optimal
solutions. It consists of discriminators and generators. The discriminators are
used to predict the performance of geometric models, and the generators to
create new candidates that will pass the discriminators. Moreover, an
evolutionary criterion approach is proposed for further improving the
efficiency of our method. Finally, not only optimal solutions can be found, but
also the well trained generators can be used to automate future antenna design
and optimization. For a dual resonance antenna design with wide bandwidth, our
proposed method is in par with Trust Region Framework and much better than the
other mature machine learning algorithms including the widely used Genetic
Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization. When there is no wide bandwidth
requirement, it is better than Trust Region Framework.

epidemiological models in order to forecast the spread of disease and the

social distancing and vaccination. Traditional scientific modeling workflows
detach the structure of a model -- its submodels and their interactions -- from
its implementation in software. Consequently, incorporating local changes to
model components may require global edits to the code-base through a manual,
time-intensive, and error-prone process. We propose a compositional modeling
framework that uses high-level algebraic structures to capture domain-specific
scientific knowledge and bridge the gap between how scientists think about
models and the code that implements them. These algebraic structures, grounded
in applied category theory, simplify and expedite modeling tasks such as model
specification, stratification, analysis, and calibration. With their structure
made explicit, models also become easier to communicate, criticize, and refine
in light of stakeholder feedback.

fully connected deep neural networks (DNNs) with rectified linear units (ReLU).
It was shown that (i) the information in the gates is analytically
characterised by a kernel called the neural path kernel (NPK) and (ii) most
critical information is learnt in the gates, in that, given the learnt gates,
the weights can be retrained from scratch without significant loss in
performance. Using the dual view, in this paper, we rethink the conventional
interpretations of DNNs thereby explicitsing the implicit interpretability of
DNNs. Towards this, we first show new theoretical properties namely rotational
invariance and ensemble structure of the NPK in the presence of convolutional
layers and skip connections respectively. Our theory leads to two surprising
empirical results that challenge conventional wisdom: (i) the weights can be
trained even with a constant 1 input, (ii) the gating masks can be shuffled,
without any significant loss in performance. These results motivate a novel
class of networks which we call deep linearly gated networks (DLGNs). DLGNs
using the phenomenon of dual lifting pave way to more direct and simpler
interpretation of DNNs as opposed to conventional interpretations. We show via
extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 that these DLGNs lead to much
better interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.

made great technical progress but its practical deployment has not been as
successful. This is mostly owing to the cost and technical difficulty of
synthesizing such computationally designed molecules. To overcome such
barriers, various methods for synthetic route design using deep neural networks
have been studied intensively in recent years. However, little progress has
been made in designing molecules and their synthetic routes simultaneously.
Here, we formulate the problem of simultaneously designing molecules with the
desired set of properties and their synthetic routes within the framework of
Bayesian inference. The design variables consist of a set of reactants in a
reaction network and its network topology. The design space is extremely large
because it consists of all combinations of purchasable reactants, often in the
order of millions or more. In addition, the designed reaction networks can
adopt any topology beyond simple multistep linear reaction routes. To solve
this hard combinatorial problem, we present a powerful sequential Monte Carlo
algorithm that recursively designs a synthetic reaction network by sequentially
building up single-step reactions. In a case study of designing drug-like
molecules based on commercially available compounds, compared with heuristic
combinatorial search methods, the proposed method shows overwhelming
performance in terms of computational efficiency and coverage and novelty with
respect to existing compounds.

basic optical properties have received little attention. In this paper we take

of absorption and scattering coefficients of a sunscreen by analysis of
experimental transmittance and reflectance spectra. We model the optical
properties of the sunscreen by two flux theory, develop approximate expressions
for interface reflection coefficients and obtain the remaining optical
parameters by fitting the two-flux theory to measurements. We analyze
spectrophotometric reflectance and transmittance spectra of experimental narrow

scattering coefficient spectra give information on the relative contributions
of these processes to the UV blocking effect as well as the scattering of
