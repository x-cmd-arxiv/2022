and fail at generalizing, especially when facing heterogeneous scenarios. In
this work, we investigate such behavior through the lens of geometry of the
loss and Hessian eigenspectrum, linking the model's lack of generalization
capacity to the sharpness of the solution. Motivated by prior studies
connecting the sharpness of the loss surface and the generalization gap, we
show that i) training clients locally with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)
or its adaptive version (ASAM) and ii) averaging stochastic weights (SWA) on
the server-side can substantially improve generalization in Federated Learning
and help bridging the gap with centralized models. By seeking parameters in
neighborhoods having uniform low loss, the model converges towards flatter
minima and its generalization significantly improves in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
those optimizers across a variety of benchmark vision datasets (e.g.
CIFAR10/100, Landmarks-User-160k, IDDA) and tasks (large scale classification,
semantic segmentation, domain generalization).

People are
constantly on the lookout for tasty foods, with junk foods being the most

gravitating toward junk food more than ever, which is bad for our health and
increases our risk of acquiring health problems. Machine learning principles
are applied in every aspect of our lives, and one of them is object recognition
via image processing. However, because foods vary in nature, this procedure is
crucial, and traditional methods like ANN, SVM, KNN, PLS etc., will result in a
low accuracy rate. All of these issues were defeated by the Deep Neural
Network. In this work, we created a fresh dataset of 10,000 data points from 20
junk food classifications to try to recognize junk foods. All of the data in
the data set was gathered using the Google search engine, which is thought to
be one-of-a-kind in every way. The goal was achieved using Convolution Neural

a 98.05\% accuracy rate throughout the research, which was satisfactory. In
addition, we conducted a test based on a real-life event, and the outcome was
extraordinary. Our goal is to advance this research to the next level, so that
it may be applied to a future study. Our ultimate goal is to create a system

time-invariant systems implies that the graphs of the open-loop systems are
quadratically separated. This separation is defined by an object known as the
multiplier. The theory of integral quadratic constraints shows that the
converse also holds under certain conditions. This paper establishes that if
the feedback is robustly stable against certain structured uncertainty, then
there always exists a multiplier that takes a corresponding form. In
particular, if the feedback is robustly stable to certain gain-type
uncertainty, then there exists a corresponding multiplier that is of
phase-type, i.e., its diagonal blocks are zeros. These results build on the
notion of phases of matrices and systems, which was recently introduced in the
field of control. Similarly, if the feedback is robustly stable to certain
phase-type uncertainty, then there exists a gain-type multiplier, i.e., its
off-diagonal blocks are zeros. The results are meaningfully instructive in the
search for a valid multiplier for establishing robust closed-loop stability,
and cover the well-known small-gain and the recent small-phase theorems.

AGT correspondence, to carry special SL(2)-monodromy charges not seen for other
branes, but none of these had previously been identified in the expected brane
charge quantization law given by K-theory.
  Here we observe that it is the subtle (and previously somewhat neglected)
twisting of equivariant K-theory by flat complex line bundles appearing inside
orbi-singularities (""inner local systems"") that makes the secondary Chern
character on a punctured plane inside an A-type singularity evaluate to the
twisted holomorphic de Rham cohomology which Feigin, Schechtman & Varchenko
showed realizes sl(2,C)-conformal blocks, here in degree 1 -- in fact it gives
the direct sum of these over all admissible fractional levels. The remaining
higher-degree conformal blocks appear similarly if we assume our previously
discussed ""Hypothesis H"" about brane charge quantization in M-theory. Since
conformal blocks -- and hence these twisted equivariant secondary Chern
characters -- solve the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation and thus constitute
representations of the braid group of motions of defect branes inside their

the problems of harvesting of natural resources. A paradigmatic situation where
this question is raised is that of fishing strategies. Indeed, overfishing is a
well-known problem in the management of live-stocks, as being too greedy may
lead to an overall dramatic depletion of the population we are harvesting. A
closely related topic is that of Nash equilibria in the context of fishing
policies. Namely, two players being in competition for the same pool of
resources, is it possible for them to find an equilibrium situation? The goal
of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of these two queries
(\emph{i.e} optimal fishing strategies for single-player models and study of
Nash equilibria for multiple players games) by using a basic yet instructive
mathematical model, the logistic-diffusive equation. In this framework, the
underlying model simply reads $-\mu\Delta \theta=\theta(K(x)-\alpha(x)-\theta)$
where $K$ accounts for natural resources, $\theta$ for the density of the
population that is being harvested and $\alpha=\alpha(x)$ encodes either the
single player fishing strategy or, when dealing with Nash equilibria, a
combination of the fishing strategies of both players. This article consists of
two main parts. The first one gives a very fine characterisation of the
optimisers for the single-player game. In the case where two players are
involved, we aim at finding a Nash equilibrium. We prove the existence of Nash
equilibria in several different regimes \textcolor{black}{and investigate
several related qualitative queries}.Our study is completed by a variety of

variation in the description of symptoms based on gender. We collect a corpus
of $150k$ items (posts and comments) annotated using the subreddit labels and
transfer learning approaches. We propose GeM, a novel task-adaptive multi-task
learning approach to identify the MH symptoms in CVD patients based on gender.
Specifically, we adapt a knowledge-assisted RoBERTa based bi-encoder model to
capture CVD-related MH symptoms. Moreover, it enhances the reliability for
differentiating the gender language in MH symptoms when compared to the
state-of-art language models. Our model achieves high (statistically
significant) performance and predicts four labels of MH issues and two gender
labels, which outperforms RoBERTa, improving the recall by 2.14% on the symptom
identification task and by 2.55% on the gender identification task.

factor to enable 5G cell densification, by providing lower cost and more agile
deployment of small cells. In addition, the adoption of MEC is important to
support ultra-low latency and high reliability required by mission-critical
applications, which constitute a milestone of the 5G and beyond vision of a
fully connected society. However, connecting antenna site, C-RAN processing and
MEC at low cost is challenging, as it requires high-capacity, low latency
connectivity delivered through a highly inter-connected topology. While PON is
being considered as a solution for providing low-cost connectivity to C-RAN,
they only allow data transmission from the endpoints (for example hosting RU at
the antenna site) towards a central node (e.g., the central office, hosting
computing equipment), thus cannot support traffic from RU towards MEC end nodes
that could host DU and possibly CU and network core. This led to research into
the evolution of PON architectures with the ability to provide direct
communications between endpoints, thus supporting mesh traffic patterns
required by MEC installations. In this context, virtualization plays a key role
in enabling efficient resource allocation (i.e. optical transmission capacity)
to endpoints, according to their communication patterns. In this article, we
address the challenge of dynamic allocation of virtual PON slices over mesh-PON
architectures to support C-RAN and MEC nodes. We make use of a mixed
analytical-iterative model to compute optimal virtual PON slice allocation,
with the objective of minimizing the use of MEC node resources, while meeting a
target latency threshold (100 $\mu s$ in our scenario). Our method is
particularly effective in reducing computation time, enabling virtual PON slice
allocation in timescales compatible with real-time or near real-time
operations.

program $\max c^Tx,\ Ax\leq b,\ x\in\{0,1\}^n$ with $m$ constraints and that of
its linear programming relaxation for a wide range of distributions on
$(A,b,c)$ . We are motivated by the work of Dey, Dubey, and Molinaro (SODA
'21), who gave a framework for relating the size of Branch-and-Bound (B&B)
trees to additive integrality gaps.
  Dyer and Frieze (MOR '89) and Borst et al. (Mathematical Programming '22),
respectively, showed that for certain random packing and Gaussian IPs, where
the entries of $A,c$ are independently distributed according to either the
uniform distribution on $[0,1]$ or the Gaussian distribution
$\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the integrality gap is bounded by $O_m(\log^2 n / n)$ with
probability at least $1-1/n-e^{-\Omega_m(1)}$. In this paper, we generalize
these results to the case where the entries of $A$ are uniformly distributed on
an integer interval (e.g., entries in $\{-1,0,1\}$), and where the columns of
$A$ are distributed according to an isotropic logconcave distribution. Second,
we substantially improve the success probability to $1-1/poly(n)$, compared to
constant probability in prior works (depending on $m$). Leveraging the
connection to Branch-and-Bound, our gap results imply that for these IPs B&B
trees have size $n^{poly(m)}$ with high probability (i.e., polynomial for fixed
$m$), which significantly extends the class of IPs for which B&B is known to be
polynomial.
  Our main technical contribution is a new linear discrepancy theorem for
random matrices. Our theorem gives general conditions under which a target
vector is equal to or very close to a $\{0,1\}$ combination of the columns of a
random matrix $A$ . The proof uses a Fourier analytic approach, building on
work of Hoberg and Rothvoss (SODA '19) and Franks and Saks (RSA '20).

initially homogeneous one - is one of the most important physical phenomena by
which gas-liquid, liquid-liquid and solid-liquid phase separation takes place.
Accordingly, thermodynamics sets the asymptotic boundaries towards which the
system must evolve, while kinetics tries to cope with it by imposing the
transport rates at which phase separation is realized. In all heterogeneous
colloidal systems observed in nature, the composition, shape, structure and
ultimately physical properties result from the trade-off between thermodynamics
and kinetics. In this work we demonstrate, by carefully selecting colloidal
systems and controlling phase separation in microfluidic devices, that it
becomes possible to go beyond N&G, disentangling kinetics effects from
thermodynamics in composition, structure and physical properties of the final
system. Using amyloid fibril and cellulose nanocrystal filamentous colloids for
which the binodal curve defining the two-phase region in the phase diagram is
given by two separate vertical lines, we extrude a solution set at one
thermodynamic branch inside the other branch, realizing nematic or cholesteric
droplets where the composition is set by thermodynamics, while the structure
and morphology are defined by dynamic flow parameters. We demonstrate that
departing from the N&G paradigm unveils new physical phenomena, such as orders
of magnitude shorter timescales, a wider phase diagram and internal cholesteric
structures that are not observable via conventional LLPS. We also show that by
co-dispersing plasmonic gold nanoparticles within colloidal liquid crystalline
droplets, our approach enables on-demand fabrication of multicomponent
heterogeneous liquid crystals, enhancing their potential, and introducing
original fundamental and technological directions in multicomponent structured

appendages coordinate and communicate among themselves during different stages
of their existence? How frequently do the fluctuations drive the length of
these dynamic protrusions out of the acceptable bounds? These questions are
addressed from a broad perspective in this review which is organized in three
parts. In part-I the list of all known cell protrusions is followed by a
comprehensive list of the mechanisms of length control of cell protrusions
reported in the literature. We review not only the dynamics of the genesis of
the protrusions, but also their resorption and regrowth as well as regeneration
after amputation. As a case study in part-II, the specific cell protrusion that

simultaneously record the activity of thousands of neurons. However, the
development of analysis approaches for such large-scale neural recordings have
been slower than those applicable to single-cell experiments. One approach that
has gained recent popularity is neural manifold learning. This approach takes
advantage of the fact that often, even though neural datasets may be very high
dimensional, the dynamics of neural activity tends to traverse a much
lower-dimensional space. The topological structures formed by these
low-dimensional neural subspaces are referred to as neural manifolds, and may
potentially provide insight linking neural circuit dynamics with cognitive
function and behavioural performance. In this paper we review a number of
linear and non-linear approaches to neural manifold learning, by setting them
within a common mathematical framework, and comparing their advantages and
disadvantages with respect to their use for neural data analysis. We apply them
to a number of datasets from published literature, comparing the manifolds that
result from their application to hippocampal place cells, motor cortical
neurons during a reaching task, and prefrontal cortical neurons during a
multi-behaviour task. We find that in many circumstances linear algorithms
produce similar results to non-linear methods, although in particular in cases
where the behavioural complexity is greater, nonlinear methods tend to find
lower dimensional manifolds, at the possible expense of interpretability. We
demonstrate that these methods are applicable to the study of neurological
disorders through simulation of a mouse model of Alzheimers Disease, and
speculate that neural manifold analysis may help us to understand the
circuit-level consequences of molecular and cellular neuropathology.

  GPU hardware","21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The interior-point method (IPM) has become the workhorse method for nonlinear
programming. The performance of IPM is directly related to the linear solver
employed to factorize the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system at each iteration
of the algorithm. When solving large-scale nonlinear problems, state-of-the art
IPM solvers rely on efficient sparse linear solvers to solve the KKT system.
Instead, we propose a novel reduced-space IPM algorithm that condenses the KKT
system into a dense matrix whose size is proportional to the number of degrees
of freedom in the problem. Depending on where the reduction occurs we derive
two variants of the reduced-space method: linearize-then-reduce and
reduce-then-linearize. We adapt their workflow so that the vast majority of
computations are accelerated on GPUs. We provide extensive numerical results on
the optimal power flow problem, comparing our GPU-accelerated reduced space IPM
with Knitro and a hybrid full space IPM algorithm. By evaluating the
derivatives on the GPU and solving the KKT system on the CPU, the hybrid
solution is already significantly faster than the CPU-only solutions. The two
reduced-space algorithms go one step further by solving the KKT system entirely
on the GPU. As expected, the performance of the two reduction algorithms
depends intrinsically on the number of available degrees of freedom: their
performance is poor when the problem has many degrees of freedom, but the two
algorithms are up to 3 times faster than Knitro as soon as the relative number
of degrees of freedom becomes smaller.

detecting novel objects guided by natural language, has gained increasing
attention from the community. Ideally, we would like to extend an
open-vocabulary detector such that it can produce bounding box predictions
based on user inputs in form of either natural language or exemplar image. This
offers great flexibility and user experience for human-computer interaction. To
this end, we propose a novel open-vocabulary detector based on DETR -- hence
the name OV-DETR -- which, once trained, can detect any object given its class
name or an exemplar image. The biggest challenge of turning DETR into an
open-vocabulary detector is that it is impossible to calculate the
classification cost matrix of novel classes without access to their labeled
images. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the learning objective as a
binary matching one between input queries (class name or exemplar image) and
the corresponding objects, which learns useful correspondence to generalize to
unseen queries during testing. For training, we choose to condition the
Transformer decoder on the input embeddings obtained from a pre-trained
vision-language model like CLIP, in order to enable matching for both text and
image queries. With extensive experiments on LVIS and COCO datasets, we
demonstrate that our OV-DETR -- the first end-to-end Transformer-based

exploration where new vertices attach to the current network via randomly

of the exploration step distribution lead to the well-studied affine
preferential attachment and uniform attachment models, as well as less well
understood dynamic network models with global attachment functionals such as
PageRank scores [Chebolu-Melsted (2008)]. We obtain local weak limits for such
networks and use them to derive asymptotics for the limiting empirical degree

PageRank of fixed vertices, including the root, and the height of the network.
Two distinct regimes are seen to emerge, based on the expected exploration
distance of incoming vertices, which we call the `fringe' and `non-fringe'
regimes. These regimes are shown to exhibit different qualitative and
quantitative properties. In particular, networks in the non-fringe regime
undergo `condensation' where the root degree grows at the same rate as the
network size. Networks in the fringe regime do not exhibit condensation. A
non-trivial phase transition phenomenon is also displayed for the PageRank
distribution, which connects to the well known power-law hypothesis. In the
process, we develop a general set of techniques involving local limits,
infinite-dimensional urn models, related multitype branching processes and
corresponding Perron-Frobenius theory, branching random walks, and in
particular relating tail exponents of various functionals to the scaling
exponents of quasi-stationary distributions of associated random walks. These

phonons are excited to average energies much higher than the phonon frequency,
eliminating the need for a quantum description. The numerical efficiency of
this method allows us to perform a self-consistent time evolution out to very
long times (tens of picoseconds) enabling us to model pump-probe experiments of
a charge density wave (CDW) material. Our system is a half-filled,
one-dimensional (1D) Holstein chain that exhibits CDW ordering due to a Peierls
transition. The chain is subjected to a time-dependent electromagnetic pump
field that excites it out of equilibrium, and then a second probe pulse is
applied after a time delay. By evolving the system to long times, we capture
the complete process of lattice excitation and subsequent relaxation to a new
equilibrium, due to an exchange of energy between the electrons and the
lattice, leading to lattice relaxation at finite temperatures. We employ an
indirect (impulsive) driving mechanism of the lattice by the pump pulse due to
the driving of the electrons by the pump field. We identify two driving
regimes, where the pump can either cause small perturbations or completely
invert the initial CDW order. Our work successfully describes the ringing of
the amplitude mode in CDW systems that has long been seen in experiment, but
never successfully explained by microscopic theory.

Dynamical Radiative and Elastic ENergy-loss Approach (DREENA) framework. We
report insensitivity of $v_2$ to the initial stages, making it unable to
distinguish between different cases. $R_{AA}$ displays sensitivity to the
presumed initial stages, but current experimental precision does not allow
resolution between these cases. We further revise the commonly accepted
procedure of fitting the energy loss parameters, for each individual initial
stage, to the measured $R_{AA}$. We show that the sensitivity of $v_2$ to
various initial stages obtained through such procedure is mostly a consequence
of fitting procedure, which may obscure the physical interpretations. Overall,
the simultaneous study of high-$p_\perp$ observables, with unchanged energy
loss parametrization and restrained temperature profiles, is crucial for future
constraints on initial stages.

polarized Alfv\'en waves and comoving, magnetosonic (fast) waves modified by

adiabatic index and we consider the limits of hydrodynamics without
self-gravity in addition to the full solution. In addition to these analytic
solutions, the linearized equations are solved numerically for a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. We use the analytic and numeric solutions to compare with results
obtained using the cosmological MHD code AREPO and find good agreement when

clearly evident in simulations with few grid points by further deriving the

batch is reconstructed given model weights and the corresponding gradients. We
introduce a method, named GradViT, that optimizes random noise into naturally
looking images via an iterative process. The optimization objective consists of
(i) a loss on matching the gradients, (ii) image prior in the form of distance
to batch-normalization statistics of a pretrained CNN model, and (iii) a total
variation regularization on patches to guide correct recovery locations. We
propose a unique loss scheduling function to overcome local minima during
optimization. We evaluate GadViT on ImageNet1K and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, and
observe unprecedentedly high fidelity and closeness to the original (hidden)

more vulnerable than previously studied CNNs due to the presence of the

in opposite hemispheres and across even and odd cycles. These regions also
present a systematic north-south polarity orientation (Joy's law) that helps
build the poloidal field that seeds the new cycle. Exceptions to Hale's law are
rare and difficult to study due to their low numbers. Here, we present a
statistical analysis of the inclination (tilt) with respect to the equator of
Hale versus anti-Hale regions spanning four solar cycles, considering two
complementary tilt definitions adopted in previous studies. Our results show
that anti-Hale regions belong to a separate population than Hale regions,

see this as evidence that they belong to a common toroidal flux system. We
speculate that anti-Hale regions originate from poloidal field sheared and
strengthened on the spot after the emergence of Hale regions with very strong
poloidal contribution. Thus, they are not in contradiction with the idea of

estimates, without significant change to provider workflows, we leverage AI to
interpret standard plane ultrasound images as well as 'fly-to' ultrasound
videos, which are 5-10s videos automatically recorded as part of the standard
of care before the still image is captured. We developed and validated three AI
models: an image model using standard plane images, a video model using fly-to
videos, and an ensemble model (combining both image and video). All three were
statistically superior to standard fetal biometry-based GA estimates derived by
expert sonographers, the ensemble model has the lowest mean absolute error

introduce a novel confinement method, dispersion-engineered temporal trapping,

Temporal confinement is imposed by an auxiliary trap pulse via cross-phase

creates a ""flying cavity"" that enhances the nonlinear interaction strength by
at least an order of magnitude. Numerical simulations confirm that temporal
trapping confines the multimode nonlinear dynamics to a single-mode subspace,

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Nevertheless, data obtained with recent
neuronal recording techniques support that the nature of the computations
carried out in the ventral visual stream is not completely captured by current
deep CNN models. To fill the gap between the ventral visual stream and deep
models, several benchmarks have been designed and organized into the
Brain-Score platform, granting a way to perform multi-layer (V1, V2, V4, IT)
and behavioral comparisons between the two counterparts. In our work, we aim to
shift the focus on architectures that take into account lateral recurrent

adaptive receptive fields. Through recurrent connections, the input s
long-range spatial dependencies can be captured in a local multi-step fashion

interfacing asynchronous outputs with a synchronously clocked telemetry (TM)

low cost alternatives including custom hardware, microcontrollers and
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This paper outlines how a TM interface

power consumption and high speed FPGAs are available as commercial
off-the-shelf (COTS) products and can be used to develop the main component of
the TMIF. Then, only a small amount of additional hardware is required for
signal buffering and level translating. This paper also discusses how this
system can be tested with a simulated TM chain in the small laboratory setting
using FPGAs and COTS specialized data acquisition products.

output of the Sun and determines its impact on the heliosphere roughly every 11
years. Besides this main periodicity, it shows century-long variations
(including periods of abnormally low solar activity called grand minima). The
Maunder Minimum (1645-1715) has generated significant interest as the archetype
of a grand minimum in magnetic activity for the Sun and other stars, suggesting
a potential link between the Sun and changes in terrestrial climate. Recent
reanalyses of sunspot observations have yielded a conflicted view on the
evolution of solar activity during the past 400 years (a steady increase versus
a constant level). This has ignited a concerted community-wide effort to
understand the depth of the Maunder Minimum and the subsequent secular
evolution of solar activity. The goal of this Perspective is to review recent
work that uses historical data to estimate long-term solar variability, and to
provide context to users of these estimates that may not be aware of their

observational coverage for different periods, as well as the level of

critical point by mapping the energetics of their structural instabilities

show a phonon instability in the $P4/mmm$ phase leading to the $I4/mcm$
structure for $R$NiO$_2$ with $R$ = Sm--Lu. I then study the non-spin-polarized
phonon dispersions of the $I4/mcm$ phase and find that they exhibit rare-earth
size dependent instabilities at the $X$ and $M$ points for materials with $R$ =
Eu--Lu. Group-theoretical analysis was used to enumerate all the isotropy
subroups due to these instablities, and the distorted structures corresponding
to their order parameters were generated using the eigenvectors of the unstable
phonons. These structures were then fully relaxed by minimizing both the atomic
forces and lattice stresses. I was able to stabilize only five out of the
twelve possible distortions. The $Pbcn$ isotropy subgroup with the $M_5^+(a,a)$
order parameter shows noticeable energy gain relative to other distortions for
the compounds with late rare-earth ions. However, the order parameter of the
lowest-energy phase switches first to $X_2^- (0,a) + M_5^+ (b,0)$ and then to
$X_2^- (0,a)$ as the size of the rare-earth ion is progressively increased.
Additionally, several distorted structures lie close in energy for the early
members of this series. These features of the structural energetics persist
even when antiferromagnetism is allowed. Such a competition between different
order parameters that can be tuned by rare-earth ion substitution suggests that
any structural transition that could arise from the phonon instabilities
present in these materials can be suppressed to 0 K.

antiferromagnetic interlayer superexchange coupling competes with the
ferromagnetic interlayer coupling mediated by the antisite Mn spins. The
temperature-pressure phase diagrams reveal that while the ordering temperature
from the paramagnetic to ordered states is almost pressure-independent, the
metamagnetic transitions show non-trivial pressure and temperature dependence,
even re-entrance. For these highly anisotropic magnets, we attribute the former
to the ordering temperature being only weakly dependent on the intralayer
parameters, the latter to the parametrically different pressure and temperature
dependence of the two interlayer couplings. Our independent probing of these
disparate magnetic interactions paves an avenue for efficient magnetic

This system uses the behaviors of other agents to create more diverse driving

from other vehicles is that there is no sensor information. We use a set of
supervisory tasks to learn an intermediate representation that is invariant to
the viewpoint of the controlling vehicle. This not only provides a richer
signal at training time but also allows more complex reasoning during
inference. Learning how all vehicles drive helps predict their behavior at test
time and can avoid collisions. We evaluate this system in closed-loop driving
simulations. Our system outperforms all prior methods on the public CARLA

density. In the vector case, the central soliton in less dense and has a
smoother transition to an $r^{-3}$ tail compared to the scalar case. As
compared to SDM, wave interference in VDM is $\sim 1/\sqrt{3}$ times smaller,
resulting in fewer low and high density regions, and more diffuse granules in
the halo. The ratio of VDM core mass to the total halo mass is lower than that
in SDM, with a steeper dependence on the total energy of the system and a
slightly larger scatter. Finally, we also initiate a study of the evolution of
intrinsic spin angular momentum in the VDM case. We see a positive correlation
between the total intrinsic spin in the simulation and the spin of the final
central core, with significant scatter. We see large intrinsic spin in the core
being possible even with vanishing amounts total angular momentum in the

recent models involving one or two stellar-mass companions around the central

attention. While these have been compared only qualitatively with observations,
the phenomenology of QPEs is developing at a fast pace, with the potential to

eRO-QPE1, the brightest QPE source discovered so far: i) the eruptions in
eRO-QPE1 occur sometimes as single isolated bursts, and at others as chaotic
mixtures of multiple overlapping bursts with very different amplitudes; ii) we
confirm that QPEs peak at later times and are broader at lower energies, with
respect to higher energies while, for the first time, we find that QPEs also
start earlier at lower energies. Furthermore, eruptions appear to undergo an
anti-clockwise hysteresis cycle in a plane of hardness ratio versus total count
rate. Behavior i) was not found before in any other QPE source and implies that
if a common trigger mechanism is in place for all QPEs, it must be able to
produce both types of timing properties, regular and complex. Result ii)
implies that the X-ray emitting component does not have an achromatic evolution
even during the start of QPEs, and that the rise is harder than the decay at a
given total count rate. This specific energy dependence could be qualitatively
compatible with inward radial propagation during the rise within a compact
accretion flow, the presence of which is suggested by the stable quiescence

post-process three high-resolution TIGRESS magnetohydrodynamic simulations
modeling local patches of star-forming galactic disks. Together, the three
simulations cover a wide range of gas surface density, gravitational potential,
and star formation rate (SFR). Our prescription for CR propagation includes the
effects of advection by the background gas, streaming along the magnetic field
at the local ion Alfv\'en speed, and diffusion relative to the Alfv\'en waves,
with the diffusion coefficient set by the balance between streaming-driven
Alfv\'en wave excitation and damping mediated by local gas properties. We find
that the combined transport processes are more effective in environments with
higher SFR. These environments are characterized by higher-velocity hot
outflows (created by clustered supernovae) that rapidly advect CRs away from
the galactic plane. As a consequence, the ratio of midplane CR pressure to
midplane gas pressures decreases with increasing SFR. We also use the
post-processed simulations to make predictions regarding potential dynamical
impacts of CRs. The relatively flat CR pressure profiles near the midplane
argue that they would not provide significant support against gravity for most
of the ISM mass. However, the CR pressure gradients are larger than the other
pressure gradients in the extra-planar region (|z|>0.5 kpc), suggesting that
CRs may affect the dynamics of galactic fountains and/or winds. The degree of
this impact is expected to increase in environments with lower SFR.

VLT/SPHERE, Subaru/SCExAO, and Gemini/GPI. A vortex also casts a shadow in the

the expectations from a rotating disc (disc+bulge for the most massive

of outflows. We find clear evidence for outflows in the most massive,
$\log(M_\star/M_{\odot}) > 10.8$, AGN-dominated galaxies, suggesting that AGNs
may be the primary drivers of these gas flows. Surprisingly, at
$\log(M_\star/M_{\odot})\leq 9.6$, the observed line profiles are fully
consistent with a rotating disc model, indicating that ionised gas outflows in
dwarf galaxies might play a negligible role even during the peak of cosmic
star-formation activity. Finally, we find that the observed mass loading factor
scales with stellar mass as expected from the TNG50 cosmological simulation,

X-ray faint for their mass. These clusters have an average low X-ray surface
brightness, a low gas fraction and are under-represented (by a factor of 10) in
X-ray surveys or entirely absent in SZ surveys. With the inclusion of these
objects, we find that the temperature-mass relation has an unprecedented large
scatter, 0.20+-0.03 dex at fixed mass, as wide as allowed by the temperature
range, and the location of a cluster in this plane depends on its surface
brightness. Clusters obey a relatively tight luminosity-temperature relation
independently of the their brightness. We interpret the wide difference in
scatter around the two relations as due to the fact that X-ray luminosity and
temperature are dominated by photons coming from small radii (in particular for
T we used a 300 kpc aperture radius) and strongly affected by gas
thermodynamics (e.g. shocks, cool-cores), whereas mass is dominated by dark
matter at large radii. We measure a slope of 2.0+-0.2 for the L500-T relation.
Given the characteristics of our sample, this value is free from the
collinearity (degeneracy) between evolution and slope and from hypothesis on
the undetected population, that both affect the analysis of X-ray selected

constrained region. This approach significantly reduces the parameter volume
emulated over, thus achieving much smaller emulator errors with fixed number of

simulations result in tight emulator errors comparable to expected DESI Y1 LRG
sample variance. We leverage the new AbacusSummit simulations and apply our
hybrid approach to CMASS non-linear galaxy clustering data. We infer
constraints on $\sigma_8 = 0.762\pm0.024$ and $f\sigma_8 (z_{eff} = 0.52) =
0.444\pm0.016$, the tightest among contemporary galaxy clustering studies. We
also demonstrate that our $f\sigma_8$ constraint is robust against secondary
biases and other HOD model choices, a critical first step towards showcasing
the robust cosmology information accessible in non-linear scales. We speculate
that the additional statistical power of DESI Y1 should tighten the growth rate
constraints by at least another 50-60%, significantly elucidating any potential
tension with Planck. We also address the ""lensing is low"" tension, where we
find that the combined effect of a lower $f\sigma_8$ and environment-based bias

stability, are the necessary criteria for the formation of accretion disc and
to radiate steadily. Turbulent motions originating from magneto-rotational
instability or hydrodynamic instability can do the required transport. We
explore the effect of a large-scale magnetic field (LSMF) over the turbulent
transport in an optically thin advective disc. In this work, turbulent
transport is represented through the usual Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-viscosity.
The evolution of the magnetic field and other variables is found by solving
vertically integrated height averaged magnetohydrodynamic equations. Depending
on its configuration, the LSMF can support or oppose $\alpha$ in outward
transport of angular momentum. Once outward transport of angular momentum is
assured, i.e., formation of the disc is confirmed through the combined effect
of $\alpha$-viscosity and the LSMF, we explore the impact of the LSMF in
thermally stabilizing the disc. As found earlier, we also find that the
advection of heat energy becomes zero or negative with increasing accretion
rate. That is why at or above a critical accretion rate, the optically thin
advective disc becomes thermally unstable. We show however that with the
addition of a strong enough magnetic field, the disc regains its thermal
stability and Joule heating turns out to play the key role in that. Throughout
our analysis the plasma-$\beta$ ($\beta_\mathrm{m}$) remains within the range
of 5-$10^3$, which does not impose any restriction in the simultaneous
operation of the LSMF and the turbulent transport.

implemented using vision-based measurements to achieve a desired formation.
Gradient-descent-based controllers using bearing measurements have been shown
to have many beneficial characteristics, such as global convergence,
applicability to different graph topologies and workspaces of arbitrary
dimension, and some flexibility in the choice of the cost. In practice,
however, such controllers typically yield convoluted paths from their initial
location to the final position in the formation. In this paper we propose a
novel procedure to optimize gradient-descent-based bearing-based formation
controllers to obtain shorter paths. Our approach is based on the
parameterization of the cost function and, by extension, of the controller. We
form and solve a nonlinear optimization problem with the sum of path lengths of
the agent trajectories as the objective and subject to the original equilibria
and global convergence conditions for formation control. Our simulation shows
that the parameters can be optimized from a very small number of training
samples (1 to 7) to straighten the trajectory by around 16% for a large number
of random initial conditions for bearing-only formation. However, in the
absence of any range information, the scale of the formation is not fixed and
this optimization may lead to an undesired compression of the formation size.
Including range measurements avoids this issue and leads to further
trajectories straightening by 66%.

the limitations of a novel hybrid Cerenkov-scintillation detector and the

Carlo simulations, previous experimental irradiations of the hybrid detector
with a linear accelerator were replicated to evaluate its general performances
and limitations. Cerenkov angular calibration curves and irradiation angle
measurements were then compared. Furthermore, the impact of the Cerenkov light
energy dependency on the detector accuracy was investigated using the energy
spectra of electrons travelling through the detector. Main results: Monte Carlo
simulations were found to be in good agreement with experimental values. The
irradiation angle absolute mean error was found to be lesser than what was
obtained experimentally, with a maximum value of 1.12 degree for the 9 MeV
beam. A 0.4% increase of the ratio of electrons having an energy below 1 MeV to
the total electrons was found to impact the Cerenkov light intensity collected
as a function of the incident angle. The effect of the Cerenkov intensity
variation on the measured angle was determined to vary according to the slope
of the angular calibration curve. While the contribution of scattered electrons
with a lower energy affects the detector accuracy, greatest discrepancies
result from the limitations of the calculation method and the calibration curve
itself. Significance: A precise knowledge of the limitations of the hybrid
detector and the irradiation angle calculation method is crucial for a clinical
implementation. Moreover, the simulations performed in this study also
corroborates hypotheses made regarding the relations between multiple Cerenkov
dependencies and observations from the experimental measurements.

and molecular gas mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm mol}$) are the main
quantities responsible for locally setting the star formation rate. This
regulation is inferred from locally resolved scaling relations between these
two quantities and the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$). However, the universality of these relations is debated. Here, we probe
the interplay between these three quantities across different galactic
environments at a spatial resolution of 150 pc. We perform a hierarchical
Bayesian linear regression to find the best set of parameters $C_{*}$, $C_{\rm
mol}$, and $C_{\rm norm}$ that describe the star-forming plane conformed by
these quantities, such that $\log \Sigma_{\rm SFR} = C_{*} \log \Sigma_{*} +
C_{\rm mol} \log \Sigma_{\rm mol} + C_{\rm norm}$, and explore variations in
the determined parameters across galactic environments, focusing our analysis
on the $C_{*}$ and $C_{\rm mol}$ slopes. We find signs of variations in the
posterior distributions of $C_{*}$ and $C_{\rm mol}$ across different galactic
environments. Bars show the most negative value of $C_{*}$, a sign of longer
depletion times, while spiral arms show the highest $C_{*}$ among all
environments. We conclude that systematic variations in the interplay of
$\Sigma_{*}$, $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ across galactic
environments exist at a spatial resolution of 150 pc, and we interpret these
variations as produced by an additional mechanism regulating the formation of
stars that is not captured by either $\Sigma_{*}$ or $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$. We
find that these variations correlate with changes in the star formation
efficiency across environments, which could be linked to the dynamical state of
the gas that prevents it from collapsing and forming stars, or to changes in
the molecular gas fraction.

with very large populations of strategic agents. Recently, the question of
learning equilibria in MFGs has gained momentum, particularly using model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) methods. One limiting factor to further scale up
using RL is that existing algorithms to solve MFGs require the mixing of
approximated quantities such as strategies or $q$-values. This is far from
being trivial in the case of non-linear function approximation that enjoy good
generalization properties, e.g. neural networks. We propose two methods to
address this shortcoming. The first one learns a mixed strategy from
distillation of historical data into a neural network and is applied to the
Fictitious Play algorithm. The second one is an online mixing method based on
regularization that does not require memorizing historical data or previous
estimates. It is used to extend Online Mirror Descent. We demonstrate
numerically that these methods efficiently enable the use of Deep RL algorithms
to solve various MFGs. In addition, we show that these methods outperform SotA

  Protocol Sustainability and Application QoE",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Middleboxes such as web proxies, firewalls, etc. are widely deployed in
today's network infrastructure. As a result, most protocols need to adapt their
behavior to co-exist. One of the most commonly used transport protocols, QUIC,
adapts to such middleboxes by falling back to TCP, where they block it. In this
paper, we argue that the blind fallback behavior of QUIC, i.e., not
distinguishing between failures caused by middleboxes and that caused by
network congestion, hugely impacts the performance of QUIC. For this, we focus
on YouTube video streaming and conduct a measurement study by utilizing
production endpoints of YouTube by enabling TCP and QUIC at a time. In total,
we collect over 2600 streaming hours of data over various bandwidth patterns,
from 5 different geographical locations and various video genres. To our
surprise, we observe that the legacy setup (TCP) either outperforms or performs
the same as the QUIC-enabled browser for more than 60% of cases. We see that
our observation is consistent across individual QoE parameters, bandwidth
patterns, locations, and videos. Next, we conduct a deep-dive analysis to
discover the root cause behind such behavior. We find a good correlation
(0.3-0.7) between fallback and QoE drop events, i.e., quality drop and
re-buffering or stalling. We further perform Granger causal analysis and find
that fallback Granger causes either quality drop or stalling for 70% of the
QUIC-enabled sessions. We believe our study will help designers revisit the
decision to enable fallback in QUIC and distinguish between the packet drops
caused by middleboxes and network congestion.

at the $\sim$3$\sigma$ level when averaging the emission across the entire
disk. The corresponding polarization fraction is $P_\textrm{frac}$ = $0.51 \pm
0.19$%. The polarization position angle $\chi$ is aligned with the minor axis
of the disk, as expected from models of dust grains aligned via radiative
alignment torques (RAT) with respect to a toroidal magnetic field ($B$-RAT) or
with respect to the anisotropy in the radiation field ($k$-RAT). When averaging
the polarized emission across the outer versus inner thirds of the disk, we
find that the polarization arises primarily from the SW third. We perform
synthetic observations assuming grain alignment via both $k$-RAT and $B$-RAT.
Both models produce polarization fractions close to our observed value when the
emission is averaged across the entire disk. When we average the models in the
inner versus outer thirds of the disk, we find that $k$-RAT is the likely
mechanism producing the polarized emission in $\beta$ Pic. A comparison of

boundedness, positivity and persistence of the nonlinear dynamical system is
established. The system being non-singular about origin, its dynamics is
explored by transforming it to a regular system. It is observed that the system
may collapse even with positive initial conditions attracted to one of the
boundary points under certain conditions. The local stability of various other
equilibrium states of the dynamic model is investigated. The region of
attraction of interior equilibrium state is obtained using Lyapunov stability.
The occurrence of hopf bifurcation about the coexistence equilibrium point with
respect to the parameter m (fraction of predators available for harvesting) is
established. The sustainable harvesting is possible in two ways firstly in the
form of stable interior equilibrium state and secondly in the form of limit
cycle. Considering the fraction m as a control variable, the optimal harvesting
policy is obtained using Pontraygin's maximum principle. The two-parameter
bifurcation diagram is obtained with respect to c and d (the cost of harvesting
and the death rate of predators respectively). The two bi-stability regions of
parameter space are identified. It is proved that for sustainable harvesting of
predators the ratio of p to c (price to cost) should be greater than a certain
threshold value dependent on predator density. The analytical results are
illustrated numerically with different parametric values.

address these issues in ViT, this paper proposes to learn Patch-to-Cluster

keys and values are directly based on clustering (with a predefined small
number of clusters). The clusters are learned end-to-end, leading to better
tokenizers and inducing joint clustering-for-attention and
attention-for-clustering for better and interpretable models. The quadratic
complexity is relaxed to linear complexity. The proposed PaCa module is used in
designing efficient and interpretable ViT backbones and semantic segmentation
head networks. In experiments, the proposed methods are tested on ImageNet-1k
image classification, MS-COCO object detection and instance segmentation and
MIT-ADE20k semantic segmentation. Compared with the prior art, it obtains
better performance in all the three benchmarks than the SWin and the PVTs by
significant margins in ImageNet-1k and MIT-ADE20k. It is also significantly
more efficient than PVT models in MS-COCO and MIT-ADE20k due to the linear
complexity. The learned clusters are semantically meaningful. Code and model

avoidance and trajectory recovery problem. The problem of finding least
deviation conflict-free aircraft trajectories that guarantee the return to a
target waypoint is highly complex due to the nature of the nonlinear
trajectories that are sought. We present a two-stage iterative algorithm that
first solves initial conflict by manipulating their speed and heading control
and then identifying each aircraft's optimal time to recover its trajectory
towards their nominal. The avoidance stage extends existing mixed-integer
programming formulations, and for the recovery stage, we propose a novel
mixed-integer formulation. We assume that speed and heading control are
continuous variables for this approach while the recovery time is treated as a
discrete variable. In this approach, it is shown that the trajectory recovery
costs can be anticipated by inducing avoidance trajectories with higher

  Framework","Accepted by ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The current popular two-stream, two-stage tracking framework extracts the
template and the search region features separately and then performs relation
modeling, thus the extracted features lack the awareness of the target and have
limited target-background discriminability. To tackle the above issue, we
propose a novel one-stream tracking (OSTrack) framework that unifies feature
learning and relation modeling by bridging the template-search image pairs with
bidirectional information flows. In this way, discriminative target-oriented
features can be dynamically extracted by mutual guidance. Since no extra heavy
relation modeling module is needed and the implementation is highly
parallelized, the proposed tracker runs at a fast speed. To further improve the
inference efficiency, an in-network candidate early elimination module is
proposed based on the strong similarity prior calculated in the one-stream
framework. As a unified framework, OSTrack achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple benchmarks, in particular, it shows impressive results
on the one-shot tracking benchmark GOT-10k, i.e., achieving 73.7% AO, improving
the existing best result (SwinTrack) by 4.3\%. Besides, our method maintains a
good performance-speed trade-off and shows faster convergence. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/botaoye/OSTrack.

oscillator, and so can suffer from a phenomenon known as resonance. We
approximate the learning system as a time varying system of ordinary
differential equations, and leverage existing theory to characterize the
system's divergence/convergence as resonant/nonresonant modes. The theoretical

empirically supplement this result to show that resonance phenomena persist
even under non-periodic covariate shift, nonlinear dynamics with neural

problem: Is every compact operator a commutator of compact operators? Our goal
is to analyze and generalize the 1970's work in this area of Joel Anderson
combined with the work of the last named author of this paper. We reduce the
general problem to a simpler sequence of finite matrix equations with norm
constraints, while at the same time developing strategies for counterexamples.
Our approach is to ask which compact operators $T$ are commutators $AB-BA$ of
compact operators $A,B$; and to analyze the implications of Joel Anderson's
contributions to this problem, which will yield a generalization of his method.
By extending the techniques of Anderson [1] we obtain new classes of operators
that are commutators of compact operators beyond those obtained in [17] and
[2]. And by employing the techniques of the last named author [22], we found
obstructions to extending Anderson's techniques in terms of certain constraints
for $T$, with special focus on when $T$ is a strictly positive compact diagonal
operator. Some of these constraints involve general universal block tridiagonal
matrix forms for operators, and some involve $\mathcal{B(H)}$-ideal
constraints. And in terms of these matrix forms, we give some equivalences,
some sufficient conditions and some necessary conditions for this
Pearcy--Topping problem and its various offshoots to hold true. These matrix
forms are a sparsification of matrix representations of an operator (an
increase in the proportion of zeros in its corners by a change of basis) and we
measure the support density of these forms. And finally we provide some
necessary conditions for the Pearcy--Topping problem involving singular numbers
and $\mathcal{B(H)}$-ideal constraints.

systems (CPS) security and resilience. The risk preference of the insured plays
an important role in cyber insurance markets. With the advances in information
technologies, it can be reshaped through nudging, marketing, or other types of
information campaigns. In this paper, we propose a framework of risk preference
design for a class of principal-agent cyber insurance problems. It creates an
additional dimension of freedom for the insurer for designing
incentive-compatible and welfare-maximizing cyber insurance contracts.
Furthermore, this approach enables a quantitative approach to reduce the moral
hazard that arises from information asymmetry between the insured and the
insurer. We characterize the conditions under which the optimal contract is
monotone in the outcome. This justifies the feasibility of linear contracts in
practice. This work establishes a metric to quantify the intensity of moral

risk preference design. We use a linear contract case study to show numerical

attention in precision medicine, mainly because it has the potential to
translate discoveries from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into medical
advances. As the high dimensional covariance matrix (or the linkage
disequilibrium (LD) pattern) of genetic variants has a block-diagonal
structure, many existing methods attempt to account for the dependence among
variants in predetermined local LD blocks/regions. Moreover, due to privacy
restrictions and data protection concerns, genetic variant dependence in each
LD block is typically estimated from external reference panels rather than the
original training dataset. This paper presents a unified analysis of block-wise
and reference panel-based estimators in a high-dimensional prediction framework
without sparsity restrictions. We find that, surprisingly, even when the
covariance matrix has a block-diagonal structure with well-defined boundaries,
block-wise estimation methods adjusting for local dependence can be
substantially less accurate than methods controlling for the whole covariance
matrix. Further, estimation methods built on the original training dataset and
external reference panels are likely to have varying performance in high
dimensions, which may reflect the cost of having only access to summary level
data from the training dataset. This analysis is based on our novel results in
random matrix theory for block-diagonal covariance matrix. We numerically
evaluate our results using extensive simulations and the large-scale UK Biobank

of amplitude and phase, a process known as registration, is essential in
exploring the underlying structure of functional data in a variety of areas,
from environmental monitoring to medical imaging. Critically, such data are
often gathered sequentially with new functional observations arriving over
time. Despite this, most available registration procedures are only applicable
to batch learning, leading to inefficient computation. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Bayesian framework for sequential registration of
functional data, which updates statistical inference as new sets of functions
are assimilated. This Bayesian model-based sequential learning approach
utilizes sequential Monte Carlo sampling to recursively update the alignment of
observed functions while accounting for associated uncertainty. As a result,
distributed computing, which is not generally an option in batch learning,
significantly reduces computational cost. Simulation studies and comparisons to
existing batch learning methods reveal that the proposed approach performs well

brought about in the Friedman equations due to Barrow entropy. In particular,
by applying the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture one obtains extra terms in
the Friedmann equations that change the Hubble function evolution during the
radiation-dominated epoch. Hence, even in the case of standard coupling between
the Ricci scalar and baryon current they can lead to a non-zero baryon
asymmetry. In order to match observations we find that the Barrow exponent
should lie in the interval $0.005 \lesssim \Delta \lesssim 0.008$, which
corresponds to a slight deviation from the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
The upper bound is tighter than the one of other observational constraints,
however the interesting feature is that in the present analysis we obtain a
non-zero lower bound. Nevertheless this lower bound would disappear if the
baryon asymmetry in Barrow-modified cosmology is generated by other mechanisms,

energies as the available generation techniques are only applicable to the soft

neutrons, or non-relativistic atoms. The highly energetic vortex particles with
an orbital angular momentum would come in handy for a number of experiments in
atomic physics, nuclear, hadronic, and accelerator physics, and to generate
them one needs to develop alternative methods, applicable for ultrarelativistic
energies and for composite particles. Here, we show that the vortex states of
in principle arbitrary particles can be generated during photon emission in
helical undulators, via Cherenkov radiation, in collisions of charged particles
with intense laser beams, in such scattering or annihilation processes as $e\mu
\to e\mu, ep \to ep, e^-e^+ \to p\bar{p}$, and so forth. The key element in
obtaining them is the postselection protocol due to entanglement between a pair
of final particles and it is largely not the process itself. The state of a
final particle -- be it a $\gamma$-ray, a hadron, a nucleus, or an ion --
becomes twisted if the azimuthal angle of the other particle momentum is
measured with a large error or is not measured at all. As a result,
requirements to the beam transverse coherence can be greatly relaxed, which
enables the generation of highly energetic vortex beams at accelerators and
synchrotron radiation facilities, thus making them a new tool for hadronic and
spin studies.

partially accessible physical system is a central challenge in stochastic
thermodynamics. A common approach is coarse-graining, which maps the dynamics
of such a system to a reduced effective one. While coarse-graining states of
the system into compound ones is a well studied concept, recent evidence hints
at a complementary description by considering observable transitions and
waiting times. In this work, we consider waiting time distributions between two
consecutive transitions of a partially observable Markov network. We formulate
an entropy estimator using their ratios to quantify irreversibility. Depending
on the complexity of the underlying network, we formulate criteria to infer
whether the entropy estimator recovers the full physical entropy production or
whether it just provides a lower bound that improves on established results.
This conceptual approach, which is based on the irreversibility of underlying
cycles, additionally enables us to derive estimators for the topology of the
network, i.e., the presence of a hidden cycle, its number of states and its
driving affinity. Adopting an equivalent semi-Markov description, our results
can be condensed into a fluctuation theorem for the corresponding semi-Markov
process. This mathematical perspective provides a unifying framework for the
entropy estimators considered here and established earlier ones. The crucial
role of the correct version of time-reversal helps to clarify a recent debate
on the meaning of formal versus physical irreversibility. Extensive numerical
calculations based on a direct evaluation of waiting-time distributions
illustrate our exact results and provide an estimate on the quality of the
bounds for affinities of hidden cycles.

suggest that radiative and mechanical feedback from young massive stars
regulate the physical and chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM)
significantly. Recent SOFIA [CII] 158 micron observations of the Orion Veil
revealed that the expanding bubble is powered by stellar winds and influenced
by previously active molecular outflows of ionizing massive stars. We aim to
investigate the mechanical feedback on the whole Veil shell by searching for
jets/outflows interacting with the Veil shell and determining the
origin/driving mechanisms of these collisions. In the light of these findings,
as well as the momenta of the dents and their dynamical timescales, we propose
that the dents are created by the interaction of collimated jets/outflows from
protostars with luminosities ranging from 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ $L_\odot$ indicating
B-type stars in the Orion star-forming cloud with the surrounding Veil shell.
However, it is challenging to pinpoint the driving stars as they may have moved
from the original ejection points of the jets/outflows. We conclude that the
dynamics of the expanding Veil shell is influenced not just by the O-type stars
in the Trapezium cluster, but also by less massive stars, especially B-type, in
the Orion Nebula. Mechanical feedback from protostars with a range of masses
appears to play an important role in determining the morphology of [HII]
regions and injecting turbulence into the medium.

formation. Because CRs are long-lived and because they are transported along
magnetic field lines independently of any gas flow, they can efficiently
distribute their feedback energy within the galaxy. We present an in-depth
investigation of (i) how CRs launch galactic winds from a disc that is forming
in a $10^{11} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ halo and (ii) how CR transport affects the
dynamics in a galactic outflow. To this end, we use the Arepo moving-mesh code
and model CR transport with the two-moment description of CR hydrodynamics.
This model includes the CR interaction with gyroresonant Alfv\'en waves that
enables us to self-consistently calculate the CR diffusion coefficient and CR
transport speeds based on coarse-grained models for plasma physical effects.
This delivers insight into key questions such as whether the effective CR
transport is streaming-like or diffusive-like, how the CR diffusion coefficient
and transport speed change inside the circumgalactic medium (CGM), and to what
degree the two-moment approximation is needed to faithfully capture these
effects. We find that the CR-diffusion coefficient reaches a steady-state in
most environments with the notable exception of our newly discovered
Alfv\'en-wave dark regions where the toroidal wind magnetic field is nearly
perpendicular to the CR pressure gradient so that CRs are unable to excite
gyroresonant Alfv\'en waves. However, CR transport itself cannot reach a
steady-state and is not well described by either the CR streaming paradigm, the
CR diffusion paradigm or a combination of both.

vinegrette. The observation that phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids
is widespread in living cells has opened an entire field of research into the
biological significance and the biophysical mechanisms of phase separation and
protein condensation in biology. Recent evidence indicate that certain proteins
and nucleic acids condensates are not simple liquids and instead display both
viscous and elastic behaviours, which in turn may have biological significance.
The aim of this perspective is to review the state-of-the-art of this quickly
emerging field focusing on the material and rheological properties of protein
condensates. Finally, we discuss the different techniques that can be employed
to quantify the viscoelasticity of condensates and highlight potential future
directions and opportunities for interdisciplinary cross-talk between chemists,
physicists and biologists.

the potential to replace large portions of the world's plastic supply with

traditional resource-intensive experimentation. In this work, we develop
multitask deep neural network property predictors using available experimental

the predictors, we identify 14 PHA-based bioplastics from a search space of

  simplified model parameters",,,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The search for dark matter is one of the main science drivers of the particle
and astroparticle physics communities. Determining the nature of dark matter
will require a broad approach, with a range of experiments pursuing different
experimental hypotheses. Within this search program, collider experiments
provide insights on dark matter which are complementary to direct/indirect
detection experiments and to astrophysical evidence. To compare results from a
wide variety of experiments, a common theoretical framework is required. The
ATLAS and CMS experiments have adopted a set of simplified models which
introduce two new particles, a dark matter particle and a mediator, and whose
interaction strengths are set by the couplings of the mediator.
  So far, the presentation of LHC and future hadron collider results has
focused on four benchmark scenarios with specific coupling values within these
simplified models. In this work, we describe ways to extend those four
benchmark scenarios to arbitrary couplings, and release the corresponding code
for use in further studies. This will allow for more straightforward comparison
of collider searches to accelerator experiments that are sensitive to smaller
couplings, such as those for the US Community Study on the Future of Particle
Physics (Snowmass 2021), and will give a more complete picture of the coupling
dependence of dark matter collider searches when compared to direct and
indirect detection searches. By using semi-analytical methods to rescale
collider limits, we drastically reduce the computing resources needed relative
to traditional approaches based on the generation of additional simulated
signal samples.

originates from the large-scale structure of the universe. Building on the
observational success of cosmic shear, along with the unprecedented quality of
large-scale cosmological datasets, the time is ripe to explore the practical
constraints from cosmic flexion. Unlike cosmic shear, which has a broad window
function for power, cosmic flexion is only measurable on small scales and
therefore can uniquely place constraints on the small-scale matter power
spectrum. Here, we present a full theoretical formalism for cosmic flexion,
including both flexion-flexion and shear-flexion two-point correlations. We
present forecasts for measuring cosmic flexion in the Dark Energy Survey (DES),
a Stage III cosmological survey, and comment on the future prospects of
measuring these cosmological flexion signals in the upcoming era of Stage IV
experiments.

Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, will enable a significant expansion of the
physics program of the CMS experiment. However, the accelerator upgrades will
also make the experimental conditions more challenging, with implications for
detector operations, triggering, and data analysis. The luminosity of the
proton-proton collisions is expected to exceed
$2-3\times10^{34}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for Run 3 (starting in 2022), and it will
be at least $5\times10^{34}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ when the High Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider is completed for Run 4. These conditions will affect muon
triggering, identification, and measurement, which are critical capabilities of
the experiment. To address these challenges, additional muon detectors are
being installed in the CMS endcaps, based on Gas Electron Multiplier
technology. For this purpose, 161 large triple-Gas Electron Multiplier
detectors have been constructed and tested. Installation of these devices began
in 2019 with the GE1/1 station and will be followed by two additional stations,
GE2/1 and ME0, to be installed in 2023 and 2026, respectively. The assembly and
quality control of the GE1/1 detectors were distributed across several
production sites around the world. We motivate and discuss the quality control
procedures that were developed to standardize the performance of the detectors,
and we present the final results of the production. Out of 161 detectors
produced, 156 detectors passed all tests, and 144 detectors are now installed
in the CMS experiment. The various visual inspections, gas tightness tests,
intrinsic noise rate characterizations, and effective gas gain and response
uniformity tests allowed the project to achieve this high success rate.

(FRBs) detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast
Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB), during the first part of the third observing
run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo (1 April 2019 15:00 UTC-1 Oct 2019
15:00 UTC). Triggers from 22 FRBs were analyzed with a search that targets
compact binary coalescences with at least one neutron star component. A
targeted search for generic gravitational-wave transients was conducted on 40
FRBs. We find no significant evidence for a gravitational-wave association in
either search. Given the large uncertainties in the distances of the FRBs
inferred from the dispersion measures in our sample, however, this does not
conclusively exclude any progenitor models that include emission of a
gravitational wave of the types searched for from any of these FRB events. We
report $90\%$ confidence lower bounds on the distance to each FRB for a range
of gravitational-wave progenitor models. By combining the inferred maximum
distance information for each FRB with the sensitivity of the
gravitational-wave searches, we set upper limits on the energy emitted through
gravitational waves for a range of emission scenarios. We find values of order
$10^{51}$-$10^{57}$ erg for a range of different emission models with central
gravitational wave frequencies in the range 70-3560 Hz. Finally, we also found
no significant coincident detection of gravitational waves with the repeater,
FRB 20200120E, which is the closest known extragalactic FRB.

  layers: Application to super-hydrophobic surfaces","18 pages, 14 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Super Hydrophobic (SH) coatings are widely used to mitigate drag in various
applications. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the beneficial wall-slip
effect produced by these materials disappears in laminar flow regimes. The main
mechanisms considered to be behind the decrease in performance are
Marangoni-induced stresses and air/liquid interface deformation. In the present
study, a new mechanism is proposed to explain the loss of performances of
SH-surfaces in laminar flow regimes. Here we consider the flow of air inside
the plastron and the associated momentum loses induced by roughness elements
with different geometric characteristics. The effects of air motion within the
plastron is coupled to the outer fluid with a homogenised boundary condition
approach. To this end, numerical simulations at the scale of the roughness
element were conducted as a function of the porosity and the tortuosity of the
domain to determine the slip velocity at the air-liquid interface.
  The homogenised boundary condition is then implemented in a theoretical model
for the outer flow to compute drag on SH-spheres at low $Re$ numbers.
Experiments of laminar SH falling spheres indicate that high values of the
tortuosity and low values of porosity lead to a loss of performances when
considering drag reduction. As anticipated, a 3D printed sphere with low
tortuosity and similar porosity demonstrated near-optimal drag reductions. A
comparative study between the predicted values and experiments shows that the
homogenised model is able to accurately predict the drag on SH surfaces for
values of the porosity and tortuosity estimated from microscopy images of the
SH textured surface.

possessing some, like credibility. However, first-price auctions are also
inherently non-truthful, and non-truthfulness may result in instability and
inefficiencies. Given these pros and cons, we seek to quantify the extent to
which first-price auctions are susceptible to manipulation. In this work we
adopt a metric that was introduced in the context of bitcoin fee design
markets: the percentage change in payment that can be achieved by being
strategic. We study the behavior of this metric for single-unit and $k$-unit
auction environments with $n$ i.i.d. buyers, and seek conditions under which
the percentage change tends to zero as $n$ grows large. To the best of our
knowledge, ours is the first rigorous study of the extent to which large
multi-unit first price auctions are susceptible to manipulation. We provide an
almost complete picture of the conditions under which they are truthful in the
large, and exhibit some surprising boundaries.

evolution of white dwarfs based on sophisticated simulations of element
transport. In this paper, we focus on the transformation of PG 1159 stars into
DO/DB white dwarfs due to the gravitational settling of heavy elements, and
then into DQ white dwarfs through the convective dredge-up of carbon. We study
the impact of several physical parameters on the evolution of the surface
carbon abundance over a wide range of effective temperature. In the hot PG 1159
and DO phases, our calculations confirm that the temperature of the PG
1159-to-DO transition depends sensitively on the stellar mass and the wind
mass-loss rate. We show that measured carbon abundances of DOZ white dwarfs are
mostly accounted for by our models, with the notable exception of the coolest
DOZ stars. In the cooler DB and DQ phases, the predicted atmospheric
composition is strongly influenced by the stellar mass, the thickness of the
envelope, the initial carbon content, the efficiency of convective overshoot,
and the presence of residual hydrogen. We demonstrate that, under reasonable
assumptions, our simulations reproduce very well the observed carbon abundance
pattern of DQ stars, which thus allows us to constrain the extent of the
overshoot region in cool helium-rich white dwarfs. We also argue that our
calculations naturally explain a number of recent empirical results, such as
the relative excess of low-mass DQ stars and the presence of trace hydrogen
and/or carbon at the surface of most DC and DZ stars.

neural network (DNN) implementations. Several prior works have utilized
side-channel leakage to recover the model architecture while the target is
executing on a hardware acceleration platform. In this work, we target an
open-source deep-learning accelerator, Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA), and
utilize electromagnetic (EM) side-channel leakage to comprehensively learn the
association between DNN architecture configurations and EM emanations. We also
consider the holistic system -- including the low-level tensor program code of
the VTA accelerator on a Xilinx FPGA and explore the effect of such low-level
configurations on the EM leakage. Our study demonstrates that both the
optimization and configuration of tensor programs will affect the EM
side-channel leakage.
  Gaining knowledge of the association between the low-level tensor program and
the EM emanations, we propose NNReArch, a lightweight tensor program scheduling
framework against side-channel-based DNN model architecture reverse
engineering. Specifically, NNReArch targets reshaping the EM traces of
different DNN operators, through scheduling the tensor program execution of the
DNN model so as to confuse the adversary. NNReArch is a comprehensive
protection framework supporting two modes, a balanced mode that strikes a
balance between the DNN model confidentiality and execution performance, and a
secure mode where the most secure setting is chosen. We implement and evaluate
the proposed framework on the open-source VTA with state-of-the-art DNN
architectures. The experimental results demonstrate that NNReArch can
efficiently enhance the model architecture security with a small performance
overhead. In addition, the proposed obfuscation technique makes reverse
engineering of the DNN architecture significantly harder.

The proposed approach has a two-stage control architecture consisting of the

velocity, heave velocity, and pitch angle setpoints are optimized by minimizing
the required vehicle propulsion energy under currents, and the line-of-sight
(LOS) guidance law is used to generate the yaw angle setpoint that ensures path
following. In the second stage, two model predictive controllers are designed
to control the vehicle motion in the horizontal and vertical planes by tracking
the optimal setpoints. The proposed controller is compared with a conventional
LOS-based control that maintains zero heave velocity relative to the current
(i.e., relative heave velocity) and derives pitch angle setpoint using LOS
guidance to reach the desired depth. Through simulations, we show that the
proposed approach can achieve more than 13% energy saving on a lawnmower-type

assumptions about what dynamics the players follow. In this paper we provide
new results and techniques that apply to broader families of games and learning
dynamics. First, we use a regret-based analysis to show that in a class of
games that includes constant-sum polymatrix and strategically zero-sum games,
dynamics such as \emph{optimistic mirror descent (OMD)} have \emph{bounded
second-order path lengths}, a property which holds even when players employ
different algorithms and prediction mechanisms. This enables us to obtain
$O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rates and optimal $O(1)$ regret bounds. Our analysis also
reveals a surprising property: OMD either reaches arbitrarily close to a Nash
equilibrium, or it outperforms the \emph{robust price of anarchy} in
efficiency. Moreover, for potential games we establish convergence to an
$\epsilon$-equilibrium after $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations for mirror descent
under a broad class of regularizers, as well as optimal $O(1)$ regret bounds
for OMD variants. Our framework also extends to near-potential games, and
unifies known analyses for distributed learning in Fisher's market model.

analysis and computations. However, a difficulty arises when accounting for
twist and cross-sectional rotation: because the angular velocity of a filament
can vary depending on the order of magnitude of the applied torque, asymptotic
theories must give accurate results for rotational dynamics over a range of
angular velocities. In this paper, we first survey the challenges in applying
existing SBTs, which are based on either singularity or full boundary integral
representations, to rotating filaments, showing in particular that they fail to
consistently treat rotation-translation coupling in curved filaments. We then
provide an alternative approach which approximates the three-dimensional

near the filament, this approach gives a grand mobility with symmetric
rotation-translation and translation-rotation coupling, making it applicable to
a broad range of angular velocities. To restore fidelity to the
three-dimensional filament geometry, we use our regularized singularity model
to inform a simple empirical equation which relates the mean force and torque

and investigates a novel approach to risk-averse shape optimization of tall

velocity, terrain conditions, and wind flow direction. A body-fitted finite
element approximation is used for the CFD with different wind directions
incorporated by re-meshing the fluid domain. The bending moment at the base of
the building is minimized, resulting in a building with reduced cost, material,
and hence, a reduced carbon footprint. Both risk-neutral and risk-averse
optimization of the twist and tapering of a representative building are
presented under uncertain inflow wind conditions that have been calibrated to
fit freely-available site-specific data from Basel, Switzerland. The
risk-averse strategy uses the conditional value-at-risk to optimize for the
low-probability high-consequence events appearing in the worst 10% of loading
conditions. Adaptive sampling is used to accelerate the gradient-based
stochastic optimization pipeline. The adaptive method is easy to implement and
particularly helpful for compute-intensive simulations because the number of
gradient samples grows only as the optimal design algorithm converges. The
performance of the final risk-averse building geometry is exceptionally
favorable when compared to the risk-neutral optimized geometry, thus,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the risk-averse design approach in

We observe that an approximate count should have 3 properties -- (i) it should
increase if there are more edges reachable from a seed; (ii) it should decrease
if mutation history information suggests an edge is hard to reach or is located
far away from currently visited edges; and (iii) it should be efficient to
compute over large CFGs. We observe that centrality measures from graph
analysis naturally provide these three properties and therefore can efficiently
approximate the likelihood of reaching unvisited edges by mutating a seed. We
therefore build a graph called the edge horizon graph that connects seeds to
their closest unvisited nodes and compute the seed node's centrality to measure
the potential edge coverage gain from mutating a seed. We implement our
approach in K-scheduler and compare with many popular seed scheduling
strategies. We find that K-scheduler increases feature coverage by 25.89%
compared to Entropic and edge coverage by 4.21% compared to the next-best
AFL-based seed scheduler, in arithmetic mean on 12 Google FuzzBench programs.
It also finds 3 more previously-unknown bugs than the next-best AFL-based seed
scheduler.

correlated distribution of play is an $\Omega(\text{poly}(\epsilon))$-strong

guarantee convergence to an exact CCE after only $O(1)$ iterations. Our results
reveal that uncoupled no-regret learning algorithms can converge to CCE in

To establish this, we show that when OMD does not reach arbitrarily close to a

contrast, we reconstruct 3D planes with a multi-view-stereo (MVS) pipeline that
takes advantage of multi-view geometry. We decouple plane reconstruction into a
semantic plane detection branch and a plane MVS branch. The semantic plane
detection branch is based on a single-view plane detection framework but with
differences. The plane MVS branch adopts a set of slanted plane hypotheses to
replace conventional depth hypotheses to perform plane sweeping strategy and
finally learns pixel-level plane parameters and its planar depth map. We
present how the two branches are learned in a balanced way, and propose a
soft-pooling loss to associate the outputs of the two branches and make them

that PlaneMVS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-view

SLOPE can be null (sparsity) or can be equal in absolute value (clustering).
Consequently, SLOPE may eliminate irrelevant predictors and may identify groups
of predictors having the same influence on the vector of responses. The notion
of SLOPE pattern allows to derive theoretical properties on sparsity and
clustering by SLOPE. Specifically, the SLOPE pattern of a vector provides: the
sign of its components (positive, negative or null), the clusters (indices of

give a necessary and sufficient condition for SLOPE pattern recovery of an

range of computer vision tasks, with the state-of-the-art results obtained

applications on resource-constrained platforms. As a result, there is much
interest in the research and development of dedicated deep learning (DL)
hardware to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of DNNs. Low-precision
representation of DNN data-structures through quantization would bring great
benefits to specialized DL hardware. However, the rigorous quantization leads
to a severe accuracy drop. As such, quantization opens a large hyper-parameter
space at bit-precision levels, the exploration of which is a major challenge.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework referred to as the Fixed-Point
Quantizer of deep neural Networks (FxP-QNet) that flexibly designs a mixed
low-precision DNN for integer-arithmetic-only deployment. Specifically, the
FxP-QNet gradually adapts the quantization level for each data-structure of
each layer based on the trade-off between the network accuracy and the
low-precision requirements. Additionally, it employs post-training
self-distillation and network prediction error statistics to optimize the
quantization of floating-point values into fixed-point numbers. Examining
FxP-QNet on state-of-the-art architectures and the benchmark ImageNet dataset,
we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FxP-QNet in achieving the

that FxP-QNet-quantized AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-18 reduce the overall

along with their applications in diverse domains. Current solutions for QNNs
pose significant challenges concerning their scalability, ensuring that the
postulates of quantum mechanics are satisfied and that the networks are
physically realizable. The exponential state space of QNNs poses challenges for
the scalability of training procedures. The no-cloning principle prohibits
making multiple copies of training samples, and the measurement postulates lead
to non-deterministic loss functions. Consequently, the physical realizability
and efficiency of existing approaches that rely on repeated measurement of
several copies of each sample for training QNNs are unclear. This paper
presents a new model for QNNs that relies on band-limited Fourier expansions of
transfer functions of quantum perceptrons (QPs) to design scalable training
procedures. This training procedure is augmented with a randomized quantum
stochastic gradient descent technique that eliminates the need for sample
replication. We show that this training procedure converges to the true minima
in expectation, even in the presence of non-determinism due to quantum

for QNNs can be made scalable; (ii) it eliminates the need for resampling, thus
staying consistent with the no-cloning rule; and (iii) enhanced data efficiency
for the overall training process since each data sample is processed once per

in-field failures of software from users is through bug reports. Unfortunately,
the quality of manually written bug reports can vary widely due to the effort
required to include essential pieces of information, such as detailed
reproduction steps (S2Rs). Despite the difficulty faced by reporters, few
existing bug reporting systems attempt to offer automated assistance to users
in crafting easily readable, and conveniently reproducible bug reports. To
address the need for proactive bug reporting systems that actively aid the user
in capturing crucial information, we introduce a novel bug reporting approach
called EBug. EBug assists reporters in writing S2Rs for mobile applications by
analyzing natural language information entered by reporters in real-time, and
linking this data to information extracted via a combination of static and
dynamic program analyses. As reporters write S2Rs, EBug is capable of
automatically suggesting potential future steps using predictive models trained
on realistic app usages. To evaluate EBug, we performed two user studies based
on 20 failures from $11$ real-world apps. The empirical studies involved ten
participants that submitted ten bug reports each and ten developers that
reproduced the submitted bug reports. In the studies, we found that reporters
were able to construct bug reports 31 faster with EBug as compared to the
state-of-the-art bug reporting system used as a baseline. EBug's reports were
also more reproducible with respect to the ones generated with the baseline.
Furthermore, we compared EBug's prediction models to other predictive modeling
approaches and found that, overall, the predictive models of our approach
outperformed the baseline approaches. Our results are promising and demonstrate
the potential benefits provided by proactively assistive bug reporting systems.

well as 2-dimensional extended magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulations showing
that a 5T initial B-field is compressed up to 25kT during the implosion. Under
these circumstances, the electrons become magnetized, which severely modifies
the plasma conditions at stagnation. In particular, in the hot spot the
electron temperature is increased (from 1keV to 5keV) while the density is

hostile regions and stay longer in their comfort zones. Running a series of
stochastic simulations, we calculate the alterations in the spatial patterns
and population densities in scenarios where not all organisms are physically or
cognitively conditioned to perform the behavioural strategy. Although the
adaptive movement strategy is not profitable in terms of territorial dominance
for the species, it may promote biodiversity. Our findings show that if all
individuals are apt to move adaptively, coexistence probability increases for
intermediary mobility. The outcomes also show that even if not all individuals
can react to the signals received from the neighbourhood, biodiversity is still
benefited, but for a shorter mobility range. We find that the improvement in
the coexistence conditions is more accentuated if organisms adjust their
movement intensely and can receive sensory information from longer distances.
We also discover that biodiversity is slightly promoted for high mobility if
the proportion of individuals participating in the strategy is low. Our results

takes place. These particles affect the grain boundary migration and the
strength of the steel. However, a reduction of the Hall-Petch coefficient as
compared to the coarse-grained (CG) steel due to the fragmentation of the
delta-ferrite particles was observed. The samples of the UFG steel were found
to have 2-3 times higher stress relaxation resistance as compared to the CG
steel (a higher macroelasticity stress and a lower stress relaxation
magnitude). The differences in the stress relaxation resistance of the UFG and
CG steels were investigated. ECAP was shown to result in an increase in the
corrosion rate and in an increased tendency to the intergranular corrosion
(IGC). The reduction of the corrosion resistance of the UFG steel was found to
originate from the increase in the fraction of the strain-induced martensite
during ECAP.

years. One recent approach is local search towards a heuristically defined
objective, which specifies language fluency, semantic meanings, and other
task-specific attributes. Search in the sentence space is realized by
word-level edit operations including insertion, replacement, and deletion.
However, such objective function is manually designed with multiple components.
Although previous work has shown maximizing this objective yields good
performance in terms of true measure of success (i.e. BLEU and iBLEU), the
objective landscape is considered to be non-smooth with significant noises,
posing challenges for optimization. In this dissertation, we address the
research problem of smoothing the noise in the heuristic search objective by
learning to model the search dynamics. Then, the learned model is combined with
the original objective function to guide the search in a bootstrapping fashion.
Experimental results show that the learned models combined with the original

exchanging materials between blood and tissues. The endothelial surface layer
(ESL) plays a critical role in regulating vascular permeability, hindering
leukocyte adhesion as well as inhibiting coagulation during inflammation.
Changes in the ESL structure are believed to cause vascular hyperpermeability
and induce thrombus formation during sepsis. In addition, ESL topography is
relevant for the interactions between red blood cells (RBCs) and the vessel
wall, including the wall-induced migration of RBCs and formation of a cell-free
layer. To investigate the influence of the ESL on the motion of RBCs, we
construct two models to represent the ESL using the immersed boundary method in
two dimensions. In particular, we use simulations to study how lift force and
drag force change over time when a RBC is placed close to the ESL as the
thickness, spatial variation, and permeability of the ESL vary. We find that
spatial variation has a significant effect on the wall-induced migration of the
RBC when the ESL is highly permeable and that the wall-induced migration can be
significantly inhibited by the presence of a thick ESL.

further propose a metric which balances the pixel classification and clustering
aspects. Moreover, we build benchmark tests on top of existing datasets and
propose a simple neural architecture as a baseline, which jointly predicts

large-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric
to efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional
latent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical
evidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through
these metrics. We further devise a mix-up strategy based on our metrics to
improve the robustness of the trained model. Our experiments on AudioSet and
Kinetics-Sounds verify our hypothesis that multi-modal models are not
necessarily more robust than their uni-modal counterparts in the face of
adversarial examples. We also observe our mix-up trained method could achieve
as much protection as traditional adversarial training, offering a
computationally cheap alternative. Implementation:

$\sim 2.4$ mag. Assuming our starburst galaxies at half their lifetimes, we
infer a duration of the starburst phase of $\sim 160$ Myr. The median stellar
mass and SFR are $\log(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot)\sim 10.6$ and
$\sim220~\mathrm{M}_\odot~$yr$^{-1}$. Assuming this SFR and the inferred
duration of the starburst phase, the stellar mass added during this phase
corresponds to $\sim 40$ per cent the median stellar mass of our sample. The
young-population age determines the position of our galaxies in the

useful for problems involving fluid-structure interactions or complex
geometries. By making use of a regular Cartesian grid that is independent of
the geometry, the IB framework yields a robust numerical scheme that can
efficiently handle immersed deformable structures. Additionally, the IB method
has been adapted to problems with prescribed motion and other PDEs with given
boundary data. IB methods for these problems traditionally involve penalty
forces which only approximately satisfy boundary conditions, or they are
formulated as constraint problems. In the latter approach, one must find the
unknown forces by solving an equation that corresponds to a poorly conditioned
first-kind integral equation. This operation can require a large number of
iterations of a Krylov method, and since a time-dependent problem requires this
solve at each time step, this method can be prohibitively inefficient without
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce a new, well-conditioned IB
formulation for boundary value problems, which we call the Immersed Boundary
Double Layer (IBDL) method. We present the method as it applies to Poisson and
Helmholtz problems to demonstrate its efficiency over the original constraint
method. In this double layer formulation, the equation for the unknown boundary
distribution corresponds to a well-conditioned second-kind integral equation
that can be solved efficiently with a small number of iterations of a Krylov
method. Furthermore, the iteration count is independent of both the mesh size
and immersed boundary point spacing. The method converges away from the
boundary, and when combined with a local interpolation, it converges in the
entire PDE domain. Additionally, while the original constraint method applies
only to Dirichlet problems, the IBDL formulation can also be used for Neumann
conditions.

electron population. The radio-to-near-infrared spectrum is confirmed to
exhibit a far-infrared break feature at the frequency of
$\nu_\mathrm{br}=2.0^{+1.2}_{-0.8} \times10^{12}$ Hz. The change in energy
index at the break ($\Delta\alpha=0.5$) is interpreted as the impact of
radiative cooling on an electron distribution sustained by continuous injection
from diffusive shock acceleration. By ascribing the derived break to this
cooling break, the magnetic field, $B$, in the hot spot is determined as a
function of its radius, $R$ within a uniform one-zone model combined with the
strong relativistic shock condition. An independent $B$-$R$ constraint is
obtained by assuming the X-ray spectrum is wholly due to
synchrotron-self-Compton emission. By combining these conditions, the two

not only should the system inputs be varied, but also the surrounding
environment should be accounted for. A number of tools have been developed to
test the system model for the possible inputs falsifying its requirements.
However, they are not directly applicable to autonomous cyber physical systems,
as the inputs to their models are generated while operating in a virtual
environment. In this paper, we aim to design a search based framework, named
AmbieGen, for generating diverse fault revealing test scenarios for autonomous
cyber physical systems. The scenarios represent an environment in which an
autonomous agent operates. The framework should be applicable to generating
different types of environments. To generate the test scenarios, we leverage
the NSGA II algorithm with two objectives. The first objective evaluates the
deviation of the observed system behaviour from its expected behaviour. The
second objective is the test case diversity, calculated as a Jaccard distance
with a reference test case. We evaluate AmbieGen on three scenario generation

a vehicle lane keeping assist system. We compared three configurations of
AmbieGen: based on a single objective genetic algorithm, multi objective, and

identification research as it offers a way to overcome the shortcomings of
port-based and deep packet inspection, especially for P2P-based Skype.
However,recent studies have focused mainly on traffic identification based on a
full-packet dataset, which poses great challenges to identifying online network
traffic. This study aims to provide a new flow identification algorithm by
taking the sampled flow records as the object. The study constructs flow
records from a Skype set as the dataset, considers the inherent NETFLOW and
extended flow metrics as features, and uses a fast correlation-based filter
algorithm to select highly correlated features. The study also proposes a new
NFI method that adopts a Bayesian updating mechanism to improve the classifier
model. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve much
better identification performance than existing state-of-the-art traffic
identification methods, and a typical feature metric is analyzed in the
sampling environment. The NFI method improves identification accuracy and
reduces false positives and false negatives compared to other methods.

field of catalysis because of the microscopic insights it provides, and thus
can guide experimental searches of novel catalysts. Several recent works have
demonstrated that low-dimensional materials can be very efficient catalysts.
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have gained much attention in past years due to
their unique properties like low toxicity, chemical inertness,
biocompatibility, crystallinity, etc. These properties of GQDs which are due to
quantum confinement and edge effects facilitate their applications in various
fields like sensing, photoelectronics, catalysis, and many more. Furthermore,
the properties of GQDs can be enhanced by doping and functionalization. In
order to understand the effects of functionalization by oxygen and boron based
groups on the catalytic properties relevant to the hydrogen-evolution reaction
(HER), we perform a systematic study of GQDs functionalized with the oxygen
(O), borinic acid (BC$_2$O), and boronic acid (BCO$_2$ ). All calculations that
included geometry optimization, electronic and adsorption mechanism, were
carried out using the Gaussian16 package, employing the hybrid functional
B3LYP, and the basis set 6-31G(d,p). With the variation in functionalization
groups in GQDs, we observe significant changes in their electronic properties.
The adsorption energy E$_{ads}$ of hydrogen over O-GQD, BC$_2$O-GQD, and
BCO$_2$-GQD is -0.059 eV, -0.031 eV and -0.032 eV respectively. Accordingly,
Gibbs free energy ($\Delta G$) of hydrogen adsorption is extraordinarily near
the ideal value (0 eV) for all the three types of functionalized GQDs. Thus,
the present work suggests pathways for experimental realization of low-cost and
multifunctional GQDs based catalysts for clean and renewable hydrogen energy
production.

3D fully nonlinear and kinetic descriptions based on the particle-in-cell (PIC)

approximation (QSA) have been successfully applied to efficiently model the
beam-plasma interaction. In a QSA-PIC algorithm, the plasma response to a
charged particle beam or laser driver is calculated based on self-consistent
forces from the QSA form of Maxwell's equations. These fields are then used to
advance the charged particle beam or laser forward by a large time step. Since
the time step is not limited by the regular Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition
that constrains a standard 3D fully electromagnetic PIC code, a 3D QSA-PIC code
can achieve orders of magnitude speedup in performance. Recently, a new hybrid
QSA-PIC algorithm that combines another speedup technique known as azimuthal
Fourier decomposition has been proposed and implemented. This hybrid algorithm
decomposes the electromagnetic fields, charge and current density into
azimuthal harmonics and only the Fourier coefficients need to be updated, which
can significantly reduce the algorithmic complexity. Modeling the laser-plasma
interaction in a full 3D PIC algorithm is very computationally expensive due to
the enormous disparity of physical scales to be resolved. In the QSA the laser
is modeled using the ponderomotive guiding center (PGC) approach. We describe
how to implement a PGC algorithm compatible with the QSA PIC algorithms based
on the azimuthal mode expansion. This algorithm permits time steps orders of

trivial. Moreover, problems exist, including blurry segmentation caused by
anisotropy resolution, high computational cost, inter-class similarity and
intra-class variability, and data imbalances. We proposed a two-stage
algorithm, named semi-supervised hybrid spine network (SSHSNet), to address
these problems by achieving accurate simultaneous VB and IVD segmentation. In
the first stage, we constructed a 2D semi-supervised DeepLabv3+ by using cross
pseudo supervision to obtain intra-slice features and coarse segmentation. In
the second stage, a 3D full-resolution patch-based DeepLabv3+ was built. This
model can be used to extract inter-slice information and combine the coarse
segmentation and intra-slice features provided from the first stage. Moreover,
a cross tri-attention module was applied to compensate for the loss of
inter-slice and intra-slice information separately generated from 2D and 3D
networks, thereby improving feature representation ability and achieving
satisfactory segmentation results. The proposed SSHSNet was validated on a
publicly available spine MR image dataset, and remarkable segmentation
performance was achieved. Moreover, results show that the proposed method has
great potential in dealing with the data imbalance problem. Based on previous
reports, few studies have incorporated a semi-supervised learning strategy with
a cross attention mechanism for spine segmentation. Therefore, the proposed
method may provide a useful tool for spine segmentation and aid clinically in
spinal disease diagnoses and treatments. Codes are publicly available at:

eliminate dispatch errors caused by loop flow effects and asymptotically

Subsequently, distributed algorithms are proposed for each area to recover

We
study the potential effects of global and persistent geopolitical conflicts on
trade, technological innovation, and economic growth. In conventional trade
models the welfare costs of such conflicts are modest. We build a multi-sector
multi-region general equilibrium model with dynamic sector-specific knowledge
diffusion, which magnifies welfare losses of trade conflicts. Idea diffusion is
mediated by the input-output structure of production, such that both sector
cost shares and import trade shares characterize the source distribution of
ideas. Using this framework, we explore the potential impact of a ""decoupling
of the global economy,"" a hypothetical scenario under which technology systems
would diverge in the global economy. We divide the global economy into two
geopolitical blocs -- East and West -- based on foreign policy similarity and
model decoupling through an increase in iceberg trade costs (full decoupling)
or tariffs (tariff decoupling). Results yield three main insights. First, the
projected welfare losses for the global economy of a decoupling scenario can be
drastic, as large as 15% in some regions and are largest in the lower income
regions as they would benefit less from technology spillovers from richer
areas. Second, the described size and pattern of welfare effects are specific
to the model with diffusion of ideas. Without diffusion of ideas the size and
variation across regions of the welfare losses would be substantially smaller.
Third, a multi-sector framework exacerbates diffusion inefficiencies induced by
trade costs relative to a single-sector one.

balancing framework for estimating the causal effect of a binary intervention
on an outcome. TFB first regresses the outcome on observed covariates, and then
selects weights that balance functions (of the covariates) that are
probabilistically near the resulting regression function. This yields balance
in the predicted values of the regression function and the covariates, with the
regression function's estimated variance determining how much balance in the
covariates is sufficient. Notably, TFB demonstrates that intentionally leaving
imbalance in some covariates can increase efficiency without introducing bias,
challenging traditions that warn against imbalance in any variable. TFB is
shown here to be useful in high-dimensional settings, with particular focus
given to kernel regularized least squares and the LASSO as potential regression
estimators. With the former, TFB contributes to the literature of kernel-based
weights. As for the LASSO, TFB uses the regression function's estimated
variance to prioritize balance in certain dimensions of the covariates, a
feature that can be exploited to great effects by choosing a sparse regression
estimator. Most appealing is that TFB is entirely defined by the choice of
regression estimator and an estimator for the resulting function's variance,
turning the problem of how best to balance the covariates into how best to
model the outcome. Additionally, this paper introduces a balance diagnostic,
Targeted Function Imbalance, which TFB minimizes subject to constraints on its

of reduced order models (ROMs) constructed using the least-squares
Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) projection method through the introduction of
preconditioning. Unlike prior related work, which focuses on preconditioning
the linear systems arising within the ROM numerical solution procedure to
improve linear solver performance, our approach leverages a preconditioning
matrix directly within the LSPG minimization problem. Applying preconditioning
in this way can improve ROM accuracy for several reasons. First,
preconditioning the LSPG formulation changes the norm defining the residual
minimization, which can improve the residual-based stability constant bounding
the ROM solution's error. The incorporation of a preconditioner into the LSPG
formulation can have the additional effect of scaling the components of the
residual being minimized, which can be beneficial for problems with disparate
scales. Importantly, we demonstrate that an 'ideal preconditioned' LSPG ROM (a
ROM preconditioned with the inverse of the Jacobian of its corresponding full
order model, or FOM) emulates projection of the FOM solution increment onto the
reduced basis, a lower bound on the ROM solution error for a given reduced
basis. By designing preconditioners that approximate the Jacobian inverse, a
ROM whose error approaches this lower bound can be obtained. The proposed
approach is evaluated in the predictive regime on several mechanical and
thermo-mechanical problems within the Albany HPC code. We demonstrate
numerically that the introduction of simple Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and ILU

a large Fermi surface with a rhombic shape in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane overlapping
neighboring Fermi surfaces. The $k_z$ dependence of the band structure suggests
that the band dispersion observed by ARPES comes from the three-dimensional
band structure of MnGa folded by a $\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}$ reconstruction.
The band dispersion across the corner of the rhombic Fermi surface forms an
electron pocket with a weak $k_z$ dependence. The effective mass and the
mobility of the bands crossing the Fermi level near the corner are estimated
from the ARPES images. Based on the experimental findings, the relationship

longstanding challenge in the Artificial Intelligence community. Current CSR
benchmarks use multiple-choice (and in relatively fewer cases, generative)
question-answering instances to evaluate machine commonsense. Recent progress
in transformer-based language representation models suggest that considerable
progress has been made on existing benchmarks. However, although tens of CSR
benchmarks currently exist, and are growing, it is not evident that the full
suite of commonsense capabilities have been systematically evaluated.
Furthermore, there are doubts about whether language models are 'fitting' to a
benchmark dataset's training partition by picking up on subtle, but normatively
irrelevant (at least for CSR), statistical features to achieve good performance
on the testing partition. To address these challenges, we propose a benchmark
called Theoretically-Grounded Commonsense Reasoning (TG-CSR) that is also based
on discriminative question answering, but with questions designed to evaluate
diverse aspects of commonsense, such as space, time, and world states. TG-CSR
is based on a subset of commonsense categories first proposed as a viable
theory of commonsense by Gordon and Hobbs. The benchmark is also designed to be
few-shot (and in the future, zero-shot), with only a few training and
validation examples provided. This report discusses the structure and
construction of the benchmark. Preliminary results suggest that the benchmark
is challenging even for advanced language representation models designed for
discriminative CSR question answering tasks.

generalized Langevin equation, of which relation to the microscopic dynamics is
well-established. In this work, we show that the dynamic equations with the
transient potential can be derived for the coupled oscillator model, without
any approximations. It is known that the dynamics of the coupled oscillator
model can be exactly described by the generalized Langevin type equations. This
fact implies that the dynamic equations with the transient potential can be
utilized as a coarse-grained dynamics model in a similar way to the generalized
Langevin equation. Then we show that the dynamic equations for the transient
potential can be also formally derived for the microscopic Hamiltonian
dynamics, without any approximations. We use the projection operator method for
the coarse-grained variables and transient potential. The dynamic equations for
the coarse-grained positions and momenta are similar to those in the
Hamiltonian dynamics, but the interaction potential is replaced by the
transient potential. The dynamic equation for the transient potential is the
generalized Langevin equation with the memory effect. Our result justifies the
use of the transient potential to describe the coarse-grained dynamics. We
propose several approximations to obtain simplified dynamics model. We show
that, under several approximations, the dynamic equation for the transient
potential reduces to the relatively simple Markovian dynamic equation for the
potential parameters.

of machine learning algorithms. However, such applications tend to use
multi-dimensional user data, which has raised widespread concerns about the
breach of users privacy. Meanwhile, wearable technologies have enabled users to
collect fitness-related data through embedded sensors to monitor their
conditions or achieve personalized fitness goals. In this paper, we propose a
novel privacy-aware personalized fitness recommender system. We introduce a
multi-level deep learning framework that learns important features from a
large-scale real fitness dataset that is collected from wearable IoT devices to
derive intelligent fitness recommendations. Unlike most existing approaches,
our approach achieves personalization by inferring the fitness characteristics
of users from sensory data and thus minimizing the need for explicitly
collecting user identity or biometric information, such as name, age, height,
weight. In particular, our proposed models and algorithms predict (a)
personalized exercise distance recommendations to help users to achieve target
calories, (b) personalized speed sequence recommendations to adjust exercise
speed given the nature of the exercise and the chosen route, and (c)
personalized heart rate sequence to guide the user of the potential health
status for future exercises. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world Fitbit
dataset demonstrated high accuracy in predicting exercise distance, speed
sequence, and heart rate sequence compared to similar studies. Furthermore, our
approach is novel compared to existing studies as it does not require
collecting and using users sensitive information, and thus it preserves the
users privacy.

contextual information considering structural relationship in context,
including inter-phrase and inter-sentence relations. Moreover, to encourage
this encoder to learn style representation better, we introduce a novel

the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized speech.

rate. Factors influencing recurrence and metastasis are currently unknown and
there are no distinct histopathological or morphological features indicating
the risks of recurrence and metastasis in LSCC. Our study focuses on the
recurrence prediction of LSCC based on H&E-stained histopathological
whole-slide images (WSI). Due to the small size of LSCC cohorts in terms of
patients with available recurrence information, standard end-to-end learning
with various convolutional neural networks for this task tends to overfit.
Also, the predictions made by these models are hard to interpret.
Histopathology WSIs are typically very large and are therefore processed as a
set of smaller tiles. In this work, we propose a novel conditional
self-supervised learning (SSL) method to learn representations of WSI at the
tile level first, and leverage clustering algorithms to identify the tiles with
similar histopathological representations. The resulting representations and
clusters from self-supervision are used as features of a survival model for
recurrence prediction at the patient level. Using two publicly available
datasets from TCGA and CPTAC, we show that our LSCC recurrence prediction
survival model outperforms both LSCC pathological stage-based approach and
machine learning baselines such as multiple instance learning. The proposed
method also enables us to explain the recurrence histopathological risk factors
via the derived clusters. This can help pathologists derive new hypotheses
regarding morphological features associated with LSCC recurrence.

an attacker running on another core can exploit the access timing of the victim

Following this principle, we propose to enrich the ""diversity"" of forgeries by
synthesizing augmented forgeries with a pool of forgery configurations and
strengthen the ""sensitivity"" to the forgeries by enforcing the model to predict

proposed integration method is based on the assumption that the correspondence

constraint pairs. Experimental results show that our method consistently

developers on GitHub, and whether end-users and developers discuss the same
human-centric issues. We then investigate whether an automated tool might help

led to a taxonomy of human-centric issues that categorises human-centric issues

developed machine learning and deep learning models that are promising in
automatically identifying and classifying human-centric issues from app reviews

user pairing in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), pairing often needs to
be conducted at high speed in dynamically changing environments; hence,
efficient recognition of the environment and finding high reward pairings are
highly demanded. In this paper, we demonstrate an efficient pairing algorithm
to recognize compatibilities among elements as well as to find a pairing that
yields a high total compatibility. The proposed pairing strategy consists of
two phases. The first is the observation phase, where compatibility information
among elements is obtained by only observing the sum of rewards. We show an
efficient strategy that allows obtaining all compatibility information with
minimal observations. The minimum number of observations under these conditions

phosphorene and antimonene, has recently gained an increasing attention owning
to its various interesting properties which can be altered or intentionally
functionalized by chemical reactions with various molecules. This work provides
a systematic study on the interactions of arsenene with the small molecules,
including H2, NH3, O2, H2O, NO, and NO2. It is predicted that O2, H2O, NO, and
NO2 are strong acceptors, while NH3 serves as a donor. Importantly, it is shown
a negligible charge transfer between H2 and arsenene which is ten times lower
than that between H2 and phosphorene and about thousand times lower than that
between H2 and InSe and antimonene. The calculated energy barrier for O2
splitting on arsenene is found to be as low as 0.67 eV. Thus, pristine arsenene
may easily oxidize in ambient conditions as other group V 2D materials. On the
other hand, the acceptor role of H2O on arsenene, similarly to the cases of
antimonene and InSe, may help to prevent the proton transfer between H2O and O
species by forming acids, which suppresses further structural degradation of
arsenene. The structural decomposition of the 2D layers upon interaction with
the environment may be avoided due to the acceptor role of H2O molecules as the
study predicts from the comparison of common group V 2D materials. However, the
protection for arsenene is still required due to its strong interaction with

eigenvalue problem, which approximates numerically the stress, displacement,
and rotation, by piecewise $(k+1)$, $k$ and $(k+1)$-th degree polynomial
functions ($k\geq 1$), respectively. The numerical eigenfunction of stress is
symmetric. By the discrete $H^1$-stability of numerical displacement, we prove
an $O(h^{k+2})$ approximation to the $L^{2}$-orthogonal projection of the
eigenspace of exact displacement for the eigenvalue problem, with proper
regularity assumption. Thus via postprocessing, we obtain a better
approximation to the eigenspace of exact displacement for the eigenproblem than
conventional methods. We also prove that numerical approximation to the
eigenfunction of stress is locking free with respect to Poisson ratio. We
introduce a hybridization to reduce the mixed method to a condensed
eigenproblem and prove an $O(h^2)$ initial approximation (independent of the
inverse of the elasticity operator) of the eigenvalue for the nonlinear
eigenproblem by using the discrete $H^1$-stability of numerical displacement,
while only an $O(h)$ approximation can be obtained if we use the traditional
inf-sup condition. Finally, we report some numerical experiments.

  Fail in Deep Learning? (Provably)","41 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the remarkable success of deep multi-modal learning in practice, it
has not been well-explained in theory. Recently, it has been observed that the
best uni-modal network outperforms the jointly trained multi-modal network,
which is counter-intuitive since multiple signals generally bring more
information. This work provides a theoretical explanation for the emergence of
such performance gap in neural networks for the prevalent joint training
framework. Based on a simplified data distribution that captures the realistic
property of multi-modal data, we prove that for the multi-modal late-fusion
network with (smoothed) ReLU activation trained jointly by gradient descent,
different modalities will compete with each other. The encoder networks will
learn only a subset of modalities. We refer to this phenomenon as modality
competition. The losing modalities, which fail to be discovered, are the
origins where the sub-optimality of joint training comes from. Experimentally,
we illustrate that modality competition matches the intrinsic behavior of
late-fusion joint training.

surface (HR-RIS) to enhance the performance of a covert communication system.
Specifically, the HR-RIS consists of passive reflecting elements and active
relay elements to manipulate the wireless signals from a transmitter to a
desired receiver while ensuring the covertness of the transmission via avoiding
such signals being detected by a warden. To fully explore the benefits offered
by the HR-RIS, we first formulate the joint design of the transmit power and
relay/reflection coefficients of the HR-RIS as an optimization problem to
maximize the covert rate subject to a covertness constraint. To tackle the
solution to this optimization problem, we then derive a closed-form expression
for an upper bound on covert rate, based on which we develop an alternate
algorithm to solve the formulated optimization problem. Our examination shows
that the HR-RIS outperforms the traditional RIS in term of achieving a higher
covert rate. Interestingly, we also observe the major part of the performance
gain brought by the HR-RIS can be obtained by a small number of active relay
elements (e.g., 5) and further increasing this number does not improve the
covert communication performance.

consistent improvement recently. However, most existing methods ignore the
efficiency issues, e.g., high computational complexity and slow adaptation
speed. Notably, efficiency has become an increasingly important evaluation
metric for few-shot techniques due to an emerging trend toward embedded AI. To
this end, we present an efficient pretrain-transfer framework (PTF) baseline
with no computational increment, which achieves comparable results with
previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Upon this baseline, we devise an
initializer named knowledge inheritance (KI) to reliably initialize the novel
weights for the box classifier, which effectively facilitates the knowledge
transfer process and boosts the adaptation speed. Within the KI initializer, we
propose an adaptive length re-scaling (ALR) strategy to alleviate the vector
length inconsistency between the predicted novel weights and the pretrained
base weights. Finally, our approach not only achieves the SOTA results across
three public benchmarks, i.e., PASCAL VOC, COCO and LVIS, but also exhibits
high efficiency with 1.8-100x faster adaptation speed against the other methods
on COCO/LVIS benchmark during few-shot transfer. To our best knowledge, this is
the first work to consider the efficiency problem in FSOD. We hope to motivate
a trend toward powerful yet efficient few-shot technique development. The codes

utilized to compensate for the singular behavior of the exact solution at $t=0$

formulate a fully discrete implicit difference scheme, we employ a standard
centered difference formula for the second-order spatial derivative, and the
Galerkin method based on piecewise linear test functions is used to approximate
the nonlinear convection term. Then we derive the existence and uniqueness of
numerical solutions for the proposed implicit difference scheme. Meanwhile,

phase offset from that below $1.5\times10^{38}$erg\,s$^{-1}$, which strongly
supports for a transition from a pencil beam to a fan beam, and thus for the
formation of shock dominated accretion column. During the rising stage of the
high double-peak regime, the faint peak got saturated in 10-100 keV band above
a luminosity of $L_t\sim1.3\times10^{39}$erg\,s$^{-1}$, which is coincident
with sudden spectral changes of both the main and faint peaks. They imply a
sudden change of emission pattern around $L_t$. The spin-up rate ($\dot{\nu}$)
is linearly correlated with luminosity ($L$) below $L_t$, consistent with the
prediction of a radiation pressure dominated (RPD) disk. The $\dot{\nu}-L$
relation flattens above $L_t$, indicating a less efficient transfer of angular
momentum and a change of accretion disk geometry above $L_t$. It is likely due
to irradiation of the disk by the central accretion column and indicates
significant radiation feedback before the inner disk radius reaching the
spherization radius.

properties given a set of covariates, provides the mathematical foundation in
practical operations management such as risk analysis and decision making given

the conditional joint distribution of bivariate outcomes based on the
distribution regression and factorization methods. This method is considered
semiparametric in that it allows for flexible modeling of both the marginal and
joint distributions conditional on covariates without imposing global
parametric assumptions across the entire distribution. In contrast to existing
parametric approaches, our method can accommodate discrete, continuous, or
mixed variables, and provides a simple yet effective way to capture
distributional dependence structures between bivariate outcomes and covariates.
Various simulation results confirm that our method can perform similarly or
better in finite samples compared to the alternative methods. In an application
to the study of a motor third-part liability insurance portfolio, the proposed
method effectively estimates risk measures such as the conditional
Value-at-Risks and Expexted Sortfall. This result suggests that this

instance discrimination, which specifies that each instance belongs to a single

Such a pre-training task is not conducive to human activity recognition tasks,
which are mainly classification tasks. To address this problem, we follow
SimCLR to propose a new contrastive learning framework that negative selection
by clustering in HAR, which is called ClusterCLHAR. Compared with SimCLR, it
redefines the negative pairs in the contrastive loss function by using
unsupervised clustering methods to generate soft labels that mask other samples
of the same cluster to avoid regarding them as negative samples. We evaluate
ClusterCLHAR on three benchmark datasets, USC-HAD, MotionSense, and UCI-HAR,
using mean F1-score as the evaluation metric. The experiment results show that

  Approach","19 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contour tracking plays a crucial role in multi-axis motion control systems,
and it requires both multi-axial contouring as well as axial precision
tracking. Among the existing contouring control methods, the cross coupled
control (CCC) lacks of an asymptotical tracking performance for general
contours, and the task coordinate frame (TCF) control usually leads to system
nonlinearity, and by design is not well-suited for multi-axis contour tracking.
Here we propose a novel time-varying internal model principle-based contouring
control (TV-IMCC) methodology to enhance contour tracking performance with both
axial and contour error reduction. The proposed TV-IMCC is twofold, including
an extended position domain framework with master-slave structures for contour
regulation, and a time-varying internal model principle-based controller for
each axial tracking precision improvement. More specifically, a novel signal
conversion algorithm is proposed with the extended position domain framework,
hence the original multi-axis contouring problem can be decoupled into numerous
axial master-slave tracking problems in the position domain, and the class of
contour candidates can be extended as well. With this, the time-varying
internal model principle-based control method is proposed to deal with the
time-varying dynamics in the axial systems resulted by the transformation
between the time and position domains. Furthermore, the stability analysis is
provided for the closed-loop system of the TV-IMCC. Various simulation and
experimental results validate the TV-IMCC with enhanced contour tracking
performance compared with the existing methods. Moreover, there is no strict
requirement on the precision of the master axis, therefore a potential of the
TV-IMCC is multi-axis macro-micro motion systems, such as laser scanner-stage
synchronized ones.

variance of object sizes and class imbalance (i.e., the extreme ratio between

overcome these challenges by introducing a novel approach, Scale-Equivalent

(1) SED imposes a consistency regularization to handle the large scale variance
problem. (2) SED alleviates the noise problem from the False Negative samples
and inferior localization precision. (3) A re-weighting strategy can implicitly
screen the potential foreground regions of the unlabeled data to reduce the
effect of class imbalance. Extensive experiments show that SED consistently
outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets with

mitigates the severe domain gaps by fine-tuning the pre-trained classifiers

spatial correlations between two polarities of events to handle noise under
extreme illumination, where different polarities of events exhibit distinctive

detect the presence of stealthy sensor attacks in industrial control systems,
where (legacy) control devices critically rely on accurate (and usually
non-encrypted) sensor readings. Specifically, we focus on stealthy attacks that
crash a sensor and then immediately impersonate that sensor by sending out fake
readings. We consider attackers who aim to stay hidden in the system for a
prolonged period. To detect such attacks, our approach relies on continuous
injection of ""micro distortion"" to the original sensor's readings. In
particular, the injected distortion should be kept strictly within a small
magnitude (e.g., $0.5\%$ of the possible operating value range), to ensure it
does not affect the normal functioning of the ICS. Our approach uses a
pre-shared secret sequence between a sensor and the defender to generate the
micro-distortions. One key challenge is that the micro-distortions injected are
often much lower than the sensor's actual readings, hence can be easily
overwhelmed by the latter. To overcome this, we leverage the observation that
sensor readings in many ICS (and power grid in particular) often change
gradually in a significant fraction of time (i.e., with small difference
between consecutive time slots). We devise a simple yet effective algorithm
that can detect stealthy attackers in a highly accurate and fast (i.e., using
less than 100 samples) manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense

$3$, respectively, in $S_{N}$, and consider, say, the permutation
$\alpha\beta\alpha\beta^{-1}$. How many fixed points does this random
permutation have on average? The current paper studies questions of this kind
and relates them to surprising topological and algebraic invariants of elements
in free products of groups.
  Formally, let $\Gamma=G_{1}*\ldots*G_{k}$ be a free product of groups where
each of $G_1,\ldots,G_k$ is either finite, finitely generated free, or an
orientable hyperbolic surface group. For a fixed element $\gamma\in\Gamma$, a
$\gamma$-random permutation in the symmetric group $S_{N}$ is the image of
$\gamma$ through a uniformly random homomorphism $\Gamma\to S_{N}$. In this
paper we study local statistics of $\gamma$-random permutations and their
asymptotics as $N$ grows. We first consider
$\mathbb{E}\left[\mathrm{fix}_{\gamma}\left(N\right)\right]$, the expected
number of fixed points in a $\gamma$-random permutation in $S_{N}$. We show
that unless $\gamma$ has finite order, the limit of
$\mathbb{E}\left[\mathrm{fix}_{\gamma}\left(N\right)\right]$ as $N\to\infty$ is
an integer, and is equal to the number of subgroups $H\le\Gamma$ containing
$\gamma$ such that $H\cong\mathbb{Z}$ or $H\cong C_{2}*C_{2}$. Equivalently,
this is the number of subgroups $H\le\Gamma$ containing $\gamma$ and having
(rational) Euler characteristic zero. We also prove there is an asymptotic
expansion for $\mathbb{E}\left[\mathrm{fix}_{\gamma}\left(N\right)\right]$ and
determine the limit distribution of the number of fixed points as $N\to\infty$.
These results are then generalized to all statistics of cycles of fixed
lengths.

cameras. Each pixel is triggered asynchronously by event. The trigger event is
the change of the brightness irradiated on the pixel. If the increment or
decrement of brightness is higher than a certain threshold, an event is output.
Compared with traditional cameras, event cameras have the advantages of high
dynamic range and no motion blur. Since events are caused by the apparent
motion of intensity edges, the majority of 3D reconstructed maps consist only
of scene edges, i.e., semi-dense maps, which is not enough for some
applications. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to realize event-based dense
reconstruction. First, deep learning is used to reconstruct intensity images
from events. And then, structure from motion (SfM) is used to estimate camera
intrinsic, extrinsic and sparse point cloud. Finally, multi-view stereo (MVS)
is used to complete dense reconstruction.

Here, the interest to protect the species of S is assessed by the resulting
expected phylogenetic diversity (ePD) of the set T, a widely used criterion for
measuring the expected amount of evolutionary history associated with T. We
consider that the survival of the protected species is assured and, on the
contrary, that there is a risk of extinction for the unprotected species. The
problem is easy to solve by a greedy type method if the extinction
probabilities of the unprotected species are known but these probabilities are
generally not easy to quantify. We show in this note that the choice of the
precise values attributed to the extinction probabilities-provided it respects
the rank of imperilment of each species-is not as decisive as might be feared
for the considered problem. The values of these probabilities have a clear
impact on the selection of the species to be protected but a little impact on
the resulting ePD. More precisely, if T1 and T2 are the two optimal subsets of
species corresponding to two scenarios (two different sets of probabilities)
the ePDs of T1 and T2 , calculated with the probabilities of the first
scenario-or with the probabilities of the second scenario-are not very

peers to adaptively form an effective clustered topology. Specifically, we
present two novel metrics for measuring client similarity and a two-stage

Maximization under the Gaussian Mixture Model assumption. We have conducted
theoretical analyses of PANM on the probability of neighbor estimation and the
error gap to the clustered optimum. We have also implemented extensive

Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments show that the proposed algorithm

predicting failure of structures and parts is required for efficient designs.
The simulation of failure processes is, from a mechanical and a numerical point
of view, challenging, especially for inhomogeneous materials, where the
microstructure influences crack initiation and propagation and leads to complex
crack patterns. The phase field method for fracture is a promising approach to
encounter such materials since it is able to describe complex fracture
phenomena like crack kinking, branching and coalescence. Moreover, it is a
largely mesh independent approach, given that the mesh is homogenous around the
crack. However, the broadly used formulation of the phase field method is
limited to isotropic materials and does not account for preferable fracture
planes defined through the material's microstructure. In this work, the method
is expanded to take orthotropic constitutive behavior and preferable directions
of crack propagation into account. We show that by using a stress-based split
and multiple phase field variables with preferable fracture planes, in
combination with a hybrid phase field approach, a general framework can be
found for simulating anisotropic, inhomogeneous materials. The stress-based
split is based on fictitious crack faces and is, herein, expanded to
anisotropic materials. Furthermore, a novel hybrid approach is used, where the
degradation of the sound material is performed based on a smooth traction free
crack boundary condition, which proves to be the main driving factor for
recovering observed crack patterns. This is shown by means of a detailed
analysis of two examples: a wooden single edge notched plate and a wood board
with a single knot and complex fiber directions. In both cases, the proposed
novel hybrid phase field approach can realistically reproduce complex failure
modes.

that $\mathcal{F}(G, \mu, b)^{wa}$ is maximal (in the sense that it's a union

it's also equivalent to the condition that the Newton stratification is finer

Newton stratum is completely contained in the weakly admissible locus involving

the resolution from 1K to 4K has no significant difference in player

  Communication with UAV Jittering",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-enabled communication is a promising solution
for secure air-to-ground (A2G) networks due to the additional secure degrees of
freedom afforded by mobility. However, the jittering characteristics caused by
the random airflow and the body vibration of the UAV itself have a
non-negligible impact on the performance of UAV communication. Considering the
impact of UAV jittering, this paper propose a robust and secure transmission
design assisted by an novel active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS),where
the reflecting elements in IRS not only adjust the phase shift but also amplify
the amplitude of signals. Specifically, under the worst-case secrecy rate
constraints, we aim to minimize the transmission power by the robust joint
design of active IRS's reflecting coefficient and beamforming at the UAV-borne
base station (UBS). However,it is challenging to solve the joint optimization
problem due to its non-convexity. To tackle this problem, the non-convex
problem is reformulated with linear approximation for the channel variations
and linear matrix inequality transformed by S-procedure and Schur's complement.
Then, we decouple this problem into two sub-problems, namely, passive
beamforming and active IRS's reflecting coefficient optimization, and solve
them through alternate optimization (AO). Finally, the numerical results
demonstrate the potential of active IRS on power saving under secure
transmission constraints and the impact of UAV jittering.

simultaneously correct and downscale (super-resolve) global ensemble forecasts

coined CorrectorGAN -- via a custom training procedure and augmented loss
function, to produce ensembles of high-resolution, bias-corrected forecasts

meteorological fields. Our model outperforms an interpolation baseline, as well
as super-resolution-only and CNN-based univariate methods, and approaches the
performance of an operational regional high-resolution model across an array of
established probabilistic metrics. Crucially, CorrectorGAN, once trained,
produces predictions in seconds on a single machine. These results raise
exciting questions about the necessity of regional models, and whether
data-driven downscaling and correction methods can be transferred to data-poor
regions that so far have had no access to high-resolution forecasts.

pilot symbols that are transmitted every coherence interval. For channels with
high Doppler spread, the rapid channel variations over time will require
considerable bandwidth for pilot transmission, leading to poor throughput. In
this paper, we propose a novel receiver architecture using deep recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) that learns the channel variations and thereby reduces
the number of pilot symbols required for channel estimation. Specifically, we
design and train an RNN to learn the correlation in the time-varying channel
and predict the channel coefficients into the future with good accuracy over a
wide range of Dopplers and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The proposed training
methodology enables accurate channel prediction through the use of techniques
such as teacher-force training, early-stop, and reduction of learning rate on
plateau. Also, the robustness of prediction for different Dopplers and SNRs is
achieved by adapting the number of predictions into the future based on the
Doppler and SNR. Numerical results show that good bit error performance is
achieved by the proposed receiver in time-varying fading channels. We also
propose a data decision driven receiver architecture using RNNs that further
reduces the pilot overhead while maintaining good bit error performance.

cameras where scenes with a wide range of illumination can not be accurately
captured with a single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image. This is generally
accomplished by capturing several LDR images with varying exposure values whose
information is then incorporated into a merged HDR image. While such approaches
work well for static scenes, dynamic scenes pose several challenges, mostly
related to the difficulty of finding reliable pixel correspondences.
Data-driven approaches tackle the problem by learning an end-to-end mapping
with paired LDR-HDR training data, but in practice generating such HDR
ground-truth labels for dynamic scenes is time-consuming and requires complex
procedures that assume control of certain dynamic elements of the scene (e.g.
actor pose) and repeatable lighting conditions (stop-motion capturing). In this
work, we propose a novel self-supervised approach for learnable HDR estimation
that alleviates the need for HDR ground-truth labels. We propose to leverage
the internal statistics of LDR images to create HDR pseudo-labels. We
separately exploit static and well-exposed parts of the input images, which in
conjunction with synthetic illumination clipping and motion augmentation
provide high quality training examples. Experimental results show that the HDR
models trained using our proposed self-supervision approach achieve performance
competitive with those trained under full supervision, and are to a large
extent superior to previous methods that equally do not require any
supervision.

tracking the temperature evolution of the in-plane and out-of-plane components
of the muon-spin polarization, an enhancement of the internal field width

by a change of the local field direction at the muon site from the $ab$-plane

two-step feature becomes well pronounced when a magnetic field of 8~T is
applied along the crystallographic $c-$axis, thus indicating a field-induced
enhancement of the electronic response at the CDW transition. These results
point to a TRSB in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ by charge order with an onset of

boundary conditions for this equation have been proposed. Recently, a family of
models using Cahn-Hilliard-type equations on the boundary of the domain to
describe adsorption processes was analysed (cf. Knopf, Lam, Liu, Metzger,

auxiliary variables introduced in the discrete setting completely. Finally, we
present simulations based on the proposed linear scheme and compare them to
results obtained using a stable, non-linear scheme to underline the

give critical insights into a data-set. Typical questions are: `Do underlying
relationships exist?', `Are some variables redundant?', and `Is some target
variable $Y$ highly or weakly dependent on variable $X$?' Interestingly,
despite the evident need for a general-purpose measure of dependency between
RV's, common practice of data analysis is that most data analysts use the
Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) to quantify dependence between RV's,
while it is well-recognized that the PCC is essentially a measure for linear
dependency only. Although many attempts have been made to define more generic
dependency measures, there is yet no consensus on a standard, general-purpose
dependency function. In fact, several ideal properties of a dependency function
have been proposed, but without much argumentation. Motivated by this, in this

diffusion after school opening in a homogeneous geographical territory. The
identification of causal effects derives from a comparison of the change in

available, and in 2021/22, when the vaccination campaign targeted individuals
of age 12-19 and above 19. The results indicate that, while school opening
determined an increase in the growth rate of Covid-19 cases in 2020/2021, this
effect has been substantially reduced by school-age vaccination in 2021/2022.
In particular, we find that an increase of approximately 10% in the vaccination
rate of school-age population reduces the growth rate of Covid-19 cases after

suggests that a permanent no vaccination scenario would have implied an

probability of the eavesdropper accumulating enough coded packets to recover
the message, known as the intercept probability, has been studied in the

However, as the channel conditions deteriorate, PPR-assisted RLC decoding
significantly improves the chances of the eavesdropper recovering the source

and clarity is crucial to prevent failure of information system development.
Past studies have found that more expressive models lead to higher performance
on tasks measuring a user s deep understanding of the model and attributed this
to lower experience of cognitive workload associated with these models. This
study examined this hypothesis by measuring users EEG brain activity while they
completed a task with different conceptual models. 30 participants were divided
into two groups: One group used a low ontologically expressive model (LOEM),
and the other group used a high ontologically expressive model (HOEM).
Cognitive workload during the task was quantified using EEG Engagement Index,
which is a ratio of brain activity power in beta as opposed to the sum of alpha
and theta frequency bands. No significant difference in cognitive workload was
found between the LOEM and HOEM groups indicating equal amounts of cognitive
processing required for understanding of both models. The main contribution of
this study is the introduction of neurophysiological measures as an objective
quantification of cognitive workload in the field of conceptual modeling and

rise to shadows seen in scattered light observations. Small warps ($<20^\circ$
misalignment) are probably more common but are also more difficult to detect
than the large misalignments studied previously. We present the characteristics
of CO emission that may be used to identify a small disc warp, found from
synthetic $^{13}$CO maps of a model misaligned circumbinary disc. The spectra
are not symmetrical, so fitting a Keplerian model is not appropriate and can
hide a warp or lead to spurious features such as spirals appearing in the
residuals. We quantify the observed warp structure by fitting sinusoids to
concentric annuli of the disc. From this we can trace the radial variation of
the peak velocity and of the azimuth of the peak velocity, i.e., the twist. At
near face-on inclinations, these radial profiles reveal the warp structure. The
twist remains detectable at moderate inclinations (${i_{\rm outer~disc}\lesssim
35^{\circ}}$) in the absence of radial flows but the measured inclination must
be accurate to $\lesssim 5^{\circ}$ to allow detection of the radial variation.
The observed twist does not provide a direct measure of the warp structure
because of its dependence on optical depth. The warp causes broad asymmetries
in the channel maps that span several channels and that are distinct from
localised features caused by embedded planets and gravitational instability. We
suspect that kinematic evidence of warps may have been missed and we suggest a
few examples where the data may be revisited.

provides hyperspectral images of surfaces, which can be used to identify the
surface type, but are difficult to analyze. Here, we demonstrate the use of an
algorithm for factorizing the data into spectra and concentrations of
characteristic components (FSC3) for identifying distinct physical surface
phases. Importantly, FSC3 is an unsupervised and fast algorithm. As example
data we use experiments on the growth of praseodymium oxide or ruthenium oxide
on ruthenium single crystal substrates, both featuring a complex distribution
of coexisting surface components, varying in both chemical composition and
crystallographic structure. With the factorization result a sparse sampling
method is demonstrated, reducing the measurement time by 1-2 orders of
magnitude, relevant for dynamic surface studies. The FSC3 concentrations are
providing the features for a support vector machine (SVM) based supervised
classification of the types. Here, specific surface regions which have been
identified structurally, via their diffraction pattern, as well as chemically
by complementary spectro-microscopic techniques, are used as training sets. A
reliable classification is demonstrated on both exemplary LEEM I-V datasets.

Gev/$c$ is presented by the PHENIX collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider. A significant direct-photon yield is observed in both collision
systems. A universal scaling is observed when the direct-photon $p_T$ spectra
for different center-of-mass energies and for different centrality selections
at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=62.4$ GeV is scaled with $(dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta)^{\alpha}$
for $\alpha=1.21{\pm}0.04$. This scaling also holds true for direct-photon
spectra from Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV measured earlier
by PHENIX, as well as the spectra from Pb$+$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=2760$ GeV
published by ALICE. The scaling power $\alpha$ seems to be independent of
$p_T$, center of mass energy, and collision centrality. The spectra from
different collision energies have a similar shape up to $p_T$ of 2 GeV/$c$. The
spectra have a local inverse slope $T_{\rm eff}$ increasing with $p_T$ of
$0.174\pm0.018$ GeV/$c$ in the range $0.4<p_T<1.3$ GeV/$c$ and increasing to
$0.289\pm0.024$ GeV/$c$ for $0.9<p_T<2.1$ GeV/$c$. The observed similarity of
low-$p_T$ direct-photon production from $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}= 39$ to 2760 GeV
suggests a common source of direct photons for the different collision energies
and event centrality selections, and suggests a comparable space-time evolution
of direct-photon emission.

stationary state of spreading dynamics in a population of mobile agents thus
depends on the interplay between the time and length scales involved in the
epidemic process and their motion in space. We analyze the steady properties
resulting from such interplay in a simple model describing epidemic spreading
(modeled as a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible process) on self-propelled
particles (performing Run-and-Tumble motion). Focusing our attention on the
diffusive long-time regime, we find that the agents' motion changes
qualitatively the nature of the epidemic transition characterized by the
emergence of a macroscopic fraction of infected agents. Indeed, the transition
becomes of the mean-field type for agents diffusing in one, two and three
dimensions, while, in the absence of motion, the epidemic outbreak depends on
the dimension of the underlying static network determined by the agents' fixed
locations. The insights obtained from a continuum description of the system are
validated by numerical simulations of an agent-based model. Our work aims at
bridging soft active matter physics and theoretical epidemiology, and may be of
interest for researchers in both communities.

largest measured. We conduct an analysis of the physics behind the electronic
mechanisms that contribute to the one- and two-bond couplings $^n {\mathbf
J}_{\mathrm{Hg}-\mathrm{Hg}}$ ($n=1, 2$). We performed calculations for
$J$-couplings in X$_2^{2+}$ and $X_3^{2+}$ ions ($X$ = Zn, Cd, Hg), within
polarization propagator theory, using the random phase approximation (RPA) and
the pure zeroth order approximation (PZOA), with Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) and
Dirac-Kohn-Sham (DKS) orbitals, both at four-component and ZORA levels. We show
that the ""paramagnetic-like"" mechanism contribute with more than 99.98\% to the
total isotropic component of the coupling tensor. By means of an analysis of
the molecular and atomic orbitals involved in the total value of the response
function, we find that the $s$-type valence atomic orbitals have a predominant
role in the description of the coupling. This fact allows us to develop an
effective model from which quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects on
$J$-coupling in the aforementioned ions can be estimated. The estimated QED
corrections were found in the interval $(0.7; ~ 1.7)$\% of the total
relativistic effect on isotropic one-bond $^1 {\mathbf J}$ coupling and from
the interval $(-0.2; ~ -0.4)$\%, in Zn-containing ions, to $(-0.8; ~ -1.2)$\%,
in Hg-containing ions, of the total isotropic coupling constant in the studied
systems. We also show that estimated QED corrections cast a visible dependence
on the nuclear charge $Z$ of each atom $X$ in the form of a power-law $\propto
Z^5$.

potentially provide a huge amount of flexibility for the power system,

this paper presents a novel distributed control strategy to coordinate space
heating across numerous residential households with diversified thermal
parameters. By employing an iterative algorithm under the game-theoretical
framework, each household adjusts its own heating schedule through demand shift
and thermal comfort compensation with the purpose of achieving individual cost
savings, whereas the aggregate peak demand is effectively shaved on the system
level. Additionally, an innovative thermal comfort model which considers both

transformer encoder layers for utterance-level LID. We call this architecture
CNN-Trans. We evaluate it on AP17-OLR data and the MLS14 set of NIST LRE 2017,

highest LID performance among all models, achieving over 40% relative

remaining for use in secondary applications. Yet, direct repurposing is
generally not possible and each cell in a battery must be evaluated, increasing
the cost of the repurposed packs due to the time intensive screening process.
In this paper, a rapid assessment of the internal resistance of a cell is
proposed. First, this method of measuring the resistance is completed on cells
from twelve retired battery packs and one fresh pack using a hybrid pulse power
characterization (HPPC) test as a benchmark for the analysis. Results from
these tests show relatively constant resistance measurements across mid to high
terminal voltages, allowing this metric to be independent of state of charge
(SOC). Then, the relation between internal resistance and capacity across the
various packs is discussed. Initial experimental results from this study show a
correlation between internal resistance and capacity which can be approximated
with a linear fit, suggesting internal resistance measurements taken above a
threshold cell terminal voltage may be a suitable initial screening metric for
the capacity of retired cells without knowledge of the SOC.

portion of the population. Since their generation does not require access to
the information of the enrolled subjects, MasterFace attacks represent a
potential security risk for widely-used face recognition systems. Previous
works proposed methods for generating such images and demonstrated that these
attacks can strongly compromise face recognition. However, previous works
followed evaluation settings consisting of older recognition models, limited
cross-dataset and cross-model evaluations, and the use of low-scale testing
data. This makes it hard to state the generalizability of these attacks. In
this work, we comprehensively analyse the generalizability of MasterFace
attacks in empirical and theoretical investigations. The empirical
investigations include the use of six state-of-the-art FR models, cross-dataset
and cross-model evaluation protocols, and utilizing testing datasets of
significantly higher size and variance. The results indicate a low
generalizability when MasterFaces are training on a different face recognition
model than the one used for testing. In these cases, the attack performance is
similar to zero-effort imposter attacks. In the theoretical investigations, we
define and estimate the face capacity and the maximum MasterFace coverage under
the assumption that identities in the face space are well separated. The
current trend of increasing the fairness and generalizability in face
recognition indicates that the vulnerability of future systems might further
decrease. Future works might analyse the utility of MasterFaces for
understanding and enhancing the robustness of face recognition models.

play an important role in the context of origin of life on our planet. It has
been observed in different environments in space including the protostellar
regions and comets. The abundance and stability of NH$_2$CHO in the early
stages of star formation can be better understood by incorporating the
formation and destruction data in the astrochemical models. We carried out an
experimental investigation to study the destruction of pure NH$_2$CHO ice at 12
K by the interaction of Ly$\alpha$ (121.6 nm) photons. The UV photo destruction
of NH$_2$CHO was studied using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. After
UV processing, the intensity of NH$_2$CHO IR bands decreases and new bands
corresponding to HCN, CO, NH$_4^+$ OCN$^-$, HNCO, and CO$_2$ appeared in the
spectrum. Destruction and cumulative product formation cross-sections were
derived. The comparison of destruction rate derived from the cross-section in
cold and dense molecular cloud for different energetic processing agents,
reveals that UV photons induces an order of magnitude higher NH$_2$CHO
destruction than cosmic rays, but three orders of magnitude lower than for H
atoms.

present an effective theoretical model and use Onsager variational principle to
successfully derive the governing equations of non-equilibrium electrowetting
dynamics for a droplet in both overdamped and underdamped regimes. It is found
that the spreading and retraction dynamics of a droplet on EWOD substrates can
be fairly well captured in the overdamped regime. By varying liquid viscosity,
droplet size, and applied voltage, we confirm that the transient dynamics of EW
can be characterized by a timescale independent of liquid viscosity, droplet

of quantum computing the goal is to output a multivariate function. The success
of such a computation can be related to the violation of a generalised Bell

quantum correlations can compute all Boolean functions using at most $2^n-1$
qubits, whereas local hidden variables (LHVs) are restricted to linear
functions. Here, we extend these results to NMQC with qutrits and prove that
quantum correlations enable the computation of all ternary functions using the

most $3^n-1$ qutrits. This yields a corresponding generalised GHZ type paradox
for any ternary function that LHVs cannot compute. We give an example for an

relevant methods toward describing quantum systems. Two generalizations of
classical graphical models are investigated, namely double-edge factor graphs
(DeFGs) and quantum factor graphs (QFGs). Conventionally, a factor in a factor
graph represents a nonnegative real-valued local functions. Two different
approaches to generalize factors in classical factor graphs yield DeFGs and
QFGs, respectively. We proposed/re-proposed and analyzed generalized versions
of belief-propagation algorithms for DeFGs/QFGs. As a particular application of
the DeFGs, we investigate the information rate and their upper/lower bounds of
classical communications over quantum channels with memory. In this study, we
also propose a data-driven method for optimizing the upper/lower bounds on
information rate.

For several of them, the agents choose control velocities using algorithms that
extract information from the environment and combine that information in
meaningful ways. From this basic formation, a framework is proposed that
classifies each robots' measurement information as sets of relevant scalars and
vectors and creates a linear combination of the measured vector sets. Along
with an optimizable parameter set, the scalar measurements are used to generate
the coefficients for the linear combination. With this framework and Bayesian
optimization, we can create effective control systems for several multi-robot
tasks, including cohesion and segregation, pattern formation, and

dependence on contact points which for deformable objects depend on the
deformations. This paper proposes a grasp quality measure for deformable
objects that uses information about object deformation to calculate the grasp
quality. Grasps are evaluated by simulating the deformations during grasping
and predicting the contacts between the gripper and the grasped object. The
contact information is then used as input for a new grasp quality metric to
quantify the grasp quality. The approach is benchmarked against two classical
rigid-body quality metrics on over 600 grasps in the Isaac gym simulation and
over 50 real-world grasps. Experimental results show an average improvement of
18\% in the grasp success rate for deformable objects compared to the classical

studied and explicit expressions are derived for the Riemann invariants and the
Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. Due to the presence of multiple characteristics in
the system under consideration, non-standard wave phenomena can occur.
Therefore we briefly review admissibility conditions for discontinuities and
then discuss possible wave interactions. In particular we will show that
overlapping rarefaction waves are possible and moreover we may have shocks that
lie inside a rarefaction wave. In contrast to nonconservative two phase flow
models, such as the Baer-Nunziato system, we can use the advantage of the
conservative form of the model under consideration. Furthermore, we show the
relation between the considered conservative SHTC system and the corresponding
barotropic version of the nonconservative Baer-Nunziato model. Additionally, we
derive the reduced four equation Kapila system for the case of instantaneous
relaxation, which is the common limit system of both, the conservative SHTC
model and the non-conservative Baer-Nunziato model. Finally, we compare exact

the feasibility to resolve the polarization of mid-infrared light with a single
chemical-vapor-deposited graphene-channel device with dissimilar metal

graphene-metal junctions on gate voltage and polarization angle. Namely, there
exist certain gate voltages providing the polarization-insensitive signal;
operation at these voltages can be used for power calibration of the detector.
At other gate voltages, the detector features very strong polarization
sensitivity, with the ratio of signals for two orthogonal polarizations
reaching ~10. Operation at these voltages can provide information about

more efficient computation than standard Neural Networks. In SNNs, neuronal
outputs (i.e. activations) are not encoded with real-valued activations but
with sequences of binary spikes. The motivation of using SNNs over conventional
neural networks is rooted in the special computational aspects of SNNs,
especially the very high degree of sparsity of neural output activations. Well
established architectures for conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
feature large spatial arrays of Processing Elements (PEs) that remain highly
underutilized in the face of activation sparsity. We propose a novel
architecture that is optimized for the processing of Convolutional SNNs (CSNNs)
that feature a high degree of activation sparsity. In our architecture, the
main strategy is to use less but highly utilized PEs. The PE array used to
perform the convolution is only as large as the kernel size, allowing all PEs
to be active as long as there are spikes to process. This constant flow of
spikes is ensured by compressing the feature maps (i.e. the activations) into
queues that can then be processed spike by spike. This compression is performed
in run-time using dedicated circuitry, leading to a self-timed scheduling. This
allows the processing time to scale directly with the number of spikes. A novel
memory organization scheme called memory interlacing is used to efficiently
store and retrieve the membrane potentials of the individual neurons using
multiple small parallel on-chip RAMs. Each RAM is hardwired to its PE, reducing
switching circuitry and allowing RAMs to be located in close proximity to the
respective PE. We implemented the proposed architecture on an FPGA and achieved
a significant speedup compared to other implementations while needing less
hardware resources and maintaining a lower energy consumption.

positions, galaxy lensing, and lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
offer powerful constraints on the large-scale structure of the Universe. In a
forthcoming analysis, we will present cosmological constraints from the
analysis of such cross-correlations measured using Year 3 data from the Dark
Energy Survey (DES), and CMB data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and
Planck. Here we present two key ingredients of this analysis: (1) an improved
CMB lensing map in the SPT-SZ survey footprint, and (2) the analysis
methodology that will be used to extract cosmological information from the
cross-correlation measurements. Relative to previous lensing maps made from the
same CMB observations, we have implemented techniques to remove contamination
from the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, enabling the extraction of
cosmological information from smaller angular scales of the cross-correlation
measurements than in previous analyses with DES Year 1 data. We describe our
model for the cross-correlations between these maps and DES data, and validate
our modeling choices to demonstrate the robustness of our analysis. We then
forecast the expected cosmological constraints from the galaxy survey-CMB
lensing auto and cross-correlations. We find that the galaxy-CMB lensing and
galaxy shear-CMB lensing correlations will on their own provide a constraint on
$S_8=\sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ at the few percent level, providing a
powerful consistency check for the DES-only constraints. We explore scenarios
where external priors on shear calibration are removed, finding that the joint
analysis of CMB lensing cross-correlations can provide constraints on the shear
calibration amplitude at the 5 to 10% level.

gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are sensitive to
the distribution of large-scale structure in the Universe. Such
cross-correlations are also expected to be immune to some of the systematic
effects that complicate correlation measurements internal to galaxy surveys. We
present measurements and modeling of the cross-correlations between galaxy
positions and galaxy lensing measured in the first three years of data from the
Dark Energy Survey with CMB lensing maps derived from a combination of data
from the 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey conducted with the South Pole Telescope and
full-sky data from the Planck satellite. The CMB lensing maps used in this
analysis have been constructed in a way that minimizes biases from the thermal
Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect, making them well suited for cross-correlation
studies. The total signal-to-noise of the cross-correlation measurements is
23.9 (25.7) when using a choice of angular scales optimized for a linear
(nonlinear) galaxy bias model. We use the cross-correlation measurements to
obtain constraints on cosmological parameters. For our fiducial galaxy sample,
which consist of four bins of magnitude-selected galaxies, we find constraints
of $\Omega_{m} = 0.272^{+0.032}_{-0.052}$ and $S_{8} \equiv \sigma_8
\sqrt{\Omega_{m}/0.3}= 0.736^{+0.032}_{-0.028}$ ($\Omega_{m} =
0.245^{+0.026}_{-0.044}$ and $S_{8} = 0.734^{+0.035}_{-0.028}$) when assuming
linear (nonlinear) galaxy bias in our modeling. Considering only the
cross-correlation of galaxy shear with CMB lensing, we find $\Omega_{m} =
0.270^{+0.043}_{-0.061}$ and $S_{8} = 0.740^{+0.034}_{-0.029}$. Our constraints
on $S_8$ are consistent with recent cosmic shear measurements, but lower than
the values preferred by primary CMB measurements from Planck.

radio-frequency (SRF) cavities operating in accelerators and it occurs whenever
contaminants, like dust, metal flakes or even absorbates, are present on the
surface of the cavity high electric field region. Field emission reduces the
maximum achievable accelerating field and generates free electrons that may
interact with the beam, damage or activate the beamline. One practical method
that can be used to mitigate this problem is in-situ plasma cleaning, or plasma
processing. The development of a processing that can be applied in-situ is
extremely advantageous, since it enables the recovery of the cryomodule
performance without the need of disassembling the whole cryomodule, which is an
extremely expensive and time-consuming process. On the other hand, plasma
processing only requires the cryomodule warm-up to room-temperature and the
subsequent processing of the contaminated cavities. The entire process is
reasonably quick and involves a limited number of personnel. For these reasons
we would like to advocate for continuing to invest in the R\&D of plasma
processing to optimize its applicability in cryomodules and for extending the
technique to other frequency ranges and cavities geometries.

processes such as droplet coalescence, development of precipitation and
ultimately cloud lifetime, may depend on the presence of surfactants in the

is based on the Lagrangian particle-based microphysics-scheme super-droplet

results show that surfactant facilitates cloud formation by increasing the

This indicates a circulation of droplets that involves activation and growth
processes from the bottom of the cloud towards the top. Moreover, our
conclusions are independent of the particular approach used for modeling the

volumes of annotated data. However, annotating medical images is laborious,
expensive, and requires human expertise, which induces the label scarcity
problem. Especially when encountering the domain shift, the problem becomes
more serious. Although deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) can leverage
well-established source domain annotations and abundant target domain data to
facilitate cross-modality image segmentation and also mitigate the label
paucity problem on the target domain, the conventional UDA methods suffer from
severe performance degradation when source domain annotations are scarce. In
this paper, we explore a challenging UDA setting - limited source domain
annotations. We aim to investigate how to efficiently leverage unlabeled data
from the source and target domains with limited source annotations for
cross-modality image segmentation. To achieve this, we propose a new
label-efficient UDA framework, termed MT-UDA, in which the student model
trained with limited source labels learns from unlabeled data of both domains
by two teacher models respectively in a semi-supervised manner. More
specifically, the student model not only distills the intra-domain semantic
knowledge by encouraging prediction consistency but also exploits the
inter-domain anatomical information by enforcing structural consistency.
Consequently, the student model can effectively integrate the underlying
knowledge beneath available data resources to mitigate the impact of source
label scarcity and yield improved cross-modality segmentation performance. We
evaluate our method on MM-WHS 2017 dataset and demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin under the
source-label scarcity scenario.

explore the potential for graph learning methods to learn embedded

a citation network. This facilitates the identification of interdisciplinary
research without the use of disciplinary categories. We evaluate these
representations and their ability to identify interdisciplinary research,
according to their utility in interdisciplinary citation prediction. We find
that those representations which preserve structural equivalence in the
citation graph are best able to predict distant, interdisciplinary interactions
in the network, according to multiple definitions of citation distance.

multi-scale discrete Boltzmann method (DBM) based on density functional kinetic
theory for thermal multiphase flow systems, ranging from continuum to
transition flow regime; the second is to present some new insights into the
thermo-hydrodynamic non-equilibrium (THNE) effects in the phase separation
process. Methodologically, DBM includes three main pillars: (i) the
determination of the fewest kinetic moment relations, which are required by the
description of significant THNE effects beyond the realm of continuum fluid
mechanics, (ii) the construction of appropriate discrete equilibrium
distribution function recovering all the desired kinetic moments, (iii) the
detection, description, presentation and analysis of THNE based on the moments
of the non-equilibrium distribution ($f-f^{(eq)}$). The incorporation of
appropriate additional higher-order thermodynamic kinetic moments considerably
extends the DBM's capability of handling larger values of the liquid-vapor
density ratio, curbing spurious currents, and ensuring mass-momentum-energy
conservation. Compared with the DBM with only first-order THNE (Gan et al. Soft
Matter 11,5336), the model retrieves kinetic moments beyond the third-order
super-Burnett level, and is accurate for weak, moderate, and strong THNE cases
even when the local Knudsen number exceeds $1/3$. Physically, the ending point
of the linear relation between THNE and the concerned physical parameter
provides a distinct criterion to identify whether the system is near or far
from equilibrium. Besides, the surface tension refrains the local THNE around
the interface, but expands the THNE range and strengthens the THNE intensity
away from the interface through interface smoothing and widening.

possibility that the encoder and decoder have shared randomness, as is the case
in systems using dithered quantizers. We define two extremal prefix-free
requirements that may be imposed on the message packets; such constraints are
useful in that they allow the decoder, and potentially other agents to uniquely
identify the end of a transmission in an online fashion. We then derive a lower
bound on the rate of prefix-free coding in terms of directed information; in
particular we show that a previously known bound still holds in the case with
shared randomness. We generalize the bound for when prefix constraints are
relaxed, and conclude with a rate-distortion formulation.

strong guidance to the planner, but their ruggedness and multi-modality can be
the major obstacle; (2) the extents of guidance and number of global/local
optima are sensitive to the changing environment, but not the ruggedness of the
surface; (3) the local optima are often closer to the global optimum than other
random points; and (4) there are considerable (and useful) overlaps on the

  Social Networks",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the use of
relational event models for dynamic social network analysis. The basis of these
models is the concept of an ""event"", defined as a triplet of time, sender, and
receiver of some social interaction. The key question that relational event
models aim to answer is what drives social interactions among actors.
Researchers often consider a very large number of predictors in their studies
(including exogenous variables, endogenous network effects, and various
interaction effects). The problem is however that employing an excessive number
of effects may lead to model overfitting and inflated Type-I error rates.
Consequently, the fitted model can easily become overly complex and the implied
social interaction behavior becomes difficult to interpret. A potential
solution to this problem is to apply Bayesian regularization using shrinkage
priors. In this paper, we propose Bayesian regularization methods for
relational event models using four different priors: a flat prior model with no
shrinkage effect, a ridge estimator with a normal prior, a Bayesian lasso with
a Laplace prior, and a horseshoe estimator with a numerically constructed prior
that has an asymptote at zero. We develop and use these models for both an
actor-oriented relational event model and a dyad-oriented relational event
model. We show how to apply Bayesian regularization methods for these models
and provide insights about which method works best and guidelines how to apply
them in practice. Our results show that shrinkage priors can reduce Type-I
errors while keeping reasonably high predictive performance and yielding
parsimonious models to explain social network behavior.

recent development of tomographic image reconstruction on sparse-view
measurements employs deep neural networks in a supervised way to tackle such

the given paired measurements/images. We propose a novel untrained Transformer
to fit the CBCT inverse solver without training data. It is mainly comprised of
an untrained 3D Transformer of billions of network weights and a multi-level
loss function with variable weights. Unlike conventional deep neural networks
(DNNs), there is no requirement of training steps in our approach. Upon
observing the hardship of optimising Transformer, the variable weights within
the loss function are designed to automatically update together with the
iteration process, ultimately stabilising its optimisation. We evaluate the
proposed approach on two publicly available datasets: SPARE and Walnut. The
results show a significant performance improvement on image quality metrics
with streak artefact reduction in the visualisation. We also provide a clinical
report by an experienced radiologist to assess our reconstructed images in a
diagnosis point of view. The source code and the optimised models are available

success in removing objects from pictures, they have yet to achieve acceptable
results for attributing consistency to gender, ethnicity, expression, and other
characteristics like the topological structure of the face. The purpose of this
work is to extract the mask region from a masked image and rebuild the area
that has been detected. This problem is complex because (i) it is difficult to
determine the gender of an image hidden behind a mask, which causes the network
to become confused and reconstruct the male face as a female or vice versa;
(ii) we may receive images from multiple angles, making it extremely difficult
to maintain the actual shape, topological structure of the face and a natural
image; and (iii) there are problems with various mask forms because, in some
cases, the area of the mask cannot be anticipated precisely; certain parts of
the mask remain on the face after completion. To solve this complex task, we
split the problem into three phases: landmark detection, object detection for
the targeted mask area, and inpainting the addressed mask region. To begin, to
solve the first problem, we have used gender classification, which detects the
actual gender behind a mask, then we detect the landmark of the masked facial
image. Second, we identified the non-face item, i.e., the mask, and used the
Mask R-CNN network to create the binary mask of the observed mask area.
Thirdly, we developed an inpainting network that uses anticipated landmarks to
create realistic images. To segment the mask, this article uses a mask R-CNN
and offers a binary segmentation map for identifying the mask area.
Additionally, we generated the image utilizing landmarks as structural guidance
through a GAN-based network. The studies presented in this paper use the FFHQ
and CelebA datasets.

for such a phenomenon is the Brownian gyrator -- a two-degree of freedom
stochastically driven system that exchanges energy and heat with the

entails a forced periodic trajectory of the system state on the thermodynamic
manifold. Dissipation and work output are expressed accordingly as path
integrals of a controlled process, and fundamental limitations on power and

focused on leveraging extra information (e.g., part-of-speech tags) or

neglected: the attention of individual heads in the transformer will be diluted

previous contexts, not the followings, are comparatively more valuable to the

architecture. One module involves interaction between attention heads to
encourage the communication, and another masked attention module captures the
dependent feature representation. Then, it aggregates two feature embeddings to
fuse information and enhances context-awareness. The experiments on the popular

a\sup{3}{\Pi}\sub{1} excited states of TlCl as well as TlF, the latter serving

have been cross-validated by, and turned out to be consistent with,

to experiment values, while for TlCl the lifetime of the a3{\Pi}+0 state is now
estimated to be 175 ns, which is much shorter than previous calculations
indicated, thus yielding a different, more favorable cooling dynamics. By
solving the rate-equation numerically, we provide evidence that TlCl could have
cooling properties similar to those of TlF. Our investigations also point to

allocate scarce resources. Technically, any scheme for lottery needs to be fair
and secure, but none of the classical schemes for lottery are unconditionally
secure and fair. As fairness demands complete unpredictability of the outcome
of the lottery, it essentially requires perfect randomness. Quantum mechanics
not only guarantees the generation of perfect randomness, it can also provide
unconditional security. Motivated by these facts, a set of strategies for
performing lottery using different type of quantum resources (e.g., single
photon states, and entangled states) are proposed here, and it's established
that the proposed strategies leads to unconditionally secure and fair lottery
schemes. A scheme for semi-quantum lottery that allows some classical users to
participate in the lottery involving quantum resources is also proposed and the
merits and demerits of all the proposed schemes are critically analysed. Its
also established that the level of security is intrinsically related to the

chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a popular iterative sampling technique, to sample
from the Boltzmann distribution of classical Ising models. In each step, the
quantum processor explores the model in superposition to propose a random move,
which is then accepted or rejected by a classical computer and returned to the
quantum processor, ensuring convergence to the desired Boltzmann distribution.
We find that this quantum algorithm converges in fewer iterations than common

long-range and symmetric nature of the exchange interactions. In this work we
prove that it is possible to obtain a highly frustrated ferromagnetic phase in
a multi-sublattices cubic structure through a fine tuning of the magnetic
interactions. This peculiar state is achieved in Ni-Mn-(In, Sn) Heusler alloys
and results in the effective decoupling of their two intertwined ferromagnetic
sublattices. One sublattice is ferromagnetic long range ordered below the
macroscopic Curie temperature (TC ) whereas the second one remains disordered
until a crossover to a polarized state occurs at T << TC . This result points
out that a fine engineering of the magnetic interactions in metallic systems
can lead to interesting novel and emergent phenomena.

validate our derivations and exhibit superior performance for the proposed

deployed in real-world sitautions: out-of-distribution data, and complex noise

amino-acid-based connectivity among MS; (2) A global-local fusion decoder to
progressively assimilate contextualized spectrum representations with a

spatial autocorrelation model. However, the theoretical basis of the inner
product equation for Moran's index is not clear. This paper is devoted to
revealing the antecedents and consequences of the inner product equation of
Moran's index. The method is mathematical derivation and empirical analysis.
The main results are as follows. First, the inner product equation is derived
from a simple spatial autoregressive model, and thus the relation between
Moran's index and spatial autoregressive coefficient is clarified. Second, the
least squares regression is proved to be one of effective approaches for
estimating spatial autoregressive coefficient. Third, the value ranges of the
spatial autoregressive coefficient can be identified from three angles of view.
A conclusion can be drawn that a spatial autocorrelation model is actually an
inverse spatial autoregressive model, and Moran's index and spatial
autoregressive models can be integrated into the same framework through inner
product and outer product equations. This work may be helpful for understanding
the connections and differences between spatial autocorrelation measurements

its grip from the beginning of 2020, has resulted in an unprecedented level of
public interest and media attention on the field of mathematical epidemiology.
Ever since the disease came to worldwide attention, numerous models with
varying levels of sophistication have been proposed; many of these have tried
to predict the course of the disease over different time-scales. Other models
have examined the efficacy of various policy measures that have been adopted
(including the unparalleled use of ""lockdowns"") to contain and combat the
disease. This multiplicity of models may have led to bewilderment in many
quarters about the true capabilities and utility of mathematical modeling. Here
we provide a brief guide to epidemiological modeling, focusing on how it has
emerged as a tool for informed public-health policy-making and has in turn,
influenced the design of interventions aimed at preventing disease outbreaks
from turning into raging epidemics. We show that the diversity of models is
somewhat illusory, as the bulk of them are rooted in the compartmental modeling
framework that we describe here. While their basic structure may appear to be a
highly idealized description of the processes at work, we show that features
that provide more realism, such as the community organization of populations or
strategic decision-making by individuals, can be incorporated into such models.
We conclude with the argument that the true value of models lies in their
ability to test in silico the consequences of different policy choices in the
course of an epidemic, a much superior alternative to trial-and-error
approaches that are highly costly in terms of both lives and socio-economic
disruption.

functioning relies on the interaction of radiation with matter is a super-human
task, given the large dimensionality of the space of possible choices for
geometry, detection technology, materials, data-acquisition, and
information-extraction techniques, and the interdependence of the related

standard, ""experience-driven"" layouts are in principle within our reach if an
objective function fully aligned with the final goals of the instrument is
maximized by means of a systematic search of the configuration space. The
stochastic nature of the involved quantum processes make the modeling of these
systems an intractable problem from a classical statistics point of view, yet
the construction of a fully differentiable pipeline and the use of deep
learning techniques may allow the simultaneous optimization of all design
parameters.
  In this document we lay down our plans for the design of a modular and
versatile modeling tool for the end-to-end optimization of complex instruments
for particle physics experiments as well as industrial and medical applications
that share the detection of radiation as their basic ingredient. We consider a
selected set of use cases to highlight the specific needs of different

denotes the number of days with 144 the daily 10-min observations. Upon
successful time series partitioning, a point forecast is computed for each of
the 144 datasets extracted from the 10 minutes wind speed observations using an
Auto-Regressive (AR) process which is then combined together to give the (N+1)

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown outstanding
performance for locomotion control of highly articulated robotic systems. Such
approaches typically involve tedious reward function tuning to achieve the
desired motion style. Imitation learning approaches such as adversarial motion
priors aim to reduce this problem by encouraging a pre-defined motion style. In
this work, we present an approach to augment the concept of adversarial motion
prior-based RL to allow for multiple, discretely switchable styles. We show
that multiple styles and skills can be learned simultaneously without notable
performance differences, even in combination with motion data-free skills. Our
approach is validated in several real-world experiments with a wheeled-legged
quadruped robot showing skills learned from existing RL controllers and
trajectory optimization, such as ducking and walking, and novel skills such as
switching between a quadrupedal and humanoid configuration. For the latter
skill, the robot is required to stand up, navigate on two wheels, and sit down.
Instead of tuning the sit-down motion, we verify that a reverse playback of the
stand-up movement helps the robot discover feasible sit-down behaviors and
avoids tedious reward function tuning.

Due to the heterogenous distribution of population and public facilities, and
the structural heterogeneity of human mobility network embedded in space,
infectious diseases break out at different locations would cause different
transmission risk and control difficulty. This study aims to investigate the
impact of initial outbreak locations on the risk of spatiotemporal transmission
and reveal the driving force behind high-risk outbreak locations. First,
integrating mobile phone location data, we built a SLIR
(susceptible-latent-infectious-removed)-based meta-population model to simulate
the spreading process of an infectious disease (i.e., COVID-19) across
fine-grained intra-urban regions (i.e., 649 communities of Shenzhen City,
China). Based on the simulation model, we evaluated the transmission risk
caused by different initial outbreak locations by proposing three indexes
including the number of infected cases (CaseNum), the number of affected
regions (RegionNum), and the spatial diffusion range (SpatialRange). Finally,
we investigated the contribution of different influential factors to the
transmission risk via machine learning models. Results indicates that different
initial outbreak locations would cause similar CaseNum but different RegionNum
and SpatialRange. To avoid the epidemic spread quickly to more regions, it is
necessary to prevent epidemic breaking out in locations with high
population-mobility flow density. While to avoid epidemic spread to larger
spatial range, remote regions with long daily trip distance of residents need
attention. Those findings can help understand the transmission risk and driving
force of initial outbreak locations within cities and make precise prevention
and control strategies in advance.
