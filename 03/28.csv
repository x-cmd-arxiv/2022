dense wireless multi-hop networks can have overwhelmingly high overhead,
causing increased congestion, energy consumption, radio footprint, and security
vulnerability. For wireless networks with dense connectivity, we propose a
distributed scheme for link sparsification with graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), which can reduce the scheduling overhead while keeping most of the
network capacity. In a nutshell, a trainable GCN module generates node
embeddings as topology-aware and reusable parameters for a local decision
mechanism, based on which a link can withdraw itself from the scheduling
contention if it is not likely to win. In medium-sized wireless networks, our
proposed sparse scheduler beats classical threshold-based sparsification
policies by retaining almost $70\%$ of the total capacity achieved by a
distributed greedy max-weight scheduler with $0.4\%$ of the point-to-point
message complexity and $2.6\%$ of the average number of interfering neighbors
per link.

quantum groups, also known as $q$-deformed Lie algebras. In this approach, a
mobile impurity can be depicted as a deformation of the Lie algebra of the
bosonic creation and annihilation operators of the bath, in which the impurity
is immersed. Accordingly, the Bose polaron can be described as a bath of
noninteracting $q$-deformed bosons, which allows us to provide an analytical
formulation of the Bose polaron at arbitrary couplings. Particularly, we derive
its ground state energy in the phonon branch of the Bogoliubov dispersion and
demonstrate that the previously observed transition from a repulsive to an
attractive polaron occurs at the vicinity where the quantum group symmetry is
broken. Furthermore, our approach has the potential to open up new avenues in
polaron physics by connecting it with seemingly unrelated research topics where
quantum groups play an essential role, such as anyons.

globally, and its early diagnosis is pivotal for the complete elimination of
malignant tumors from the body. This research develops an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) framework for supervised skin lesion segmentation employing
the deep learning approach. The proposed framework, called MFSNet (Multi-Focus
Segmentation Network), uses differently scaled feature maps for computing the
final segmentation mask using raw input RGB images of skin lesions. In doing
so, initially, the images are preprocessed to remove unwanted artifacts and
noises. The MFSNet employs the Res2Net backbone, a recently proposed
convolutional neural network (CNN), for obtaining deep features used in a
Parallel Partial Decoder (PPD) module to get a global map of the segmentation
mask. In different stages of the network, convolution features and multi-scale
maps are used in two boundary attention (BA) modules and two reverse attention
(RA) modules to generate the final segmentation output. MFSNet, when evaluated
on three publicly available datasets: $PH^2$, ISIC 2017, and HAM10000,
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, justifying the reliability of the

  Observation-centric Re-Update (ORU)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Kalman filter (KF) based methods for multi-object tracking (MOT) make an
assumption that objects move linearly. While this assumption is acceptable for
very short periods of occlusion, linear estimates of motion for prolonged time
can be highly inaccurate. Moreover, when there is no measurement available to
update Kalman filter parameters, the standard convention is to trust the priori
state estimations for posteriori update. This leads to the accumulation of
errors during a period of occlusion. The error causes significant motion
direction variance in practice. In this work, we show that a basic Kalman
filter can still obtain state-of-the-art tracking performance if proper care is
taken to fix the noise accumulated during occlusion. Instead of relying only on
the linear state estimate (i.e., estimation-centric approach), we use object
observations (i.e., the measurements by object detector) to compute a virtual
trajectory over the occlusion period to fix the error accumulation of filter
parameters during the occlusion period. This allows more time steps to correct
errors accumulated during occlusion. We name our method Observation-Centric
SORT (OC-SORT). It remains Simple, Online, and Real-Time but improves
robustness during occlusion and non-linear motion. Given off-the-shelf
detections as input, OC-SORT runs at 700+ FPS on a single CPU. It achieves
state-of-the-art on multiple datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, KITTI, head
tracking, and especially DanceTrack where the object motion is highly
non-linear. The code and models are available at

for systems that can efficiently evaluate spatial queries over large data sets.
These queries are notoriously expensive using traditional database solutions.
While faster response times can be attained through powerful clusters or
servers with large main-memory, these options, due to cost and complexity, are
out of reach to many data scientists and analysts making up the long tail.
  Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are now widely available even in

  In this paper we present SPADE, a GPU-powered spatial database engine that
supports a rich set of spatial queries. We discuss the challenges involved in
attaining efficient query evaluation over large datasets as well as portability
across different GPU hardware, and how these are addressed in SPADE. We
performed a detailed experimental evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the

optimized for normalized discounted cumulative gains (NDCG) or online

pairs of diameter $d=4$ and $d=5$, which generate S-boxes of size $6\times 6$

leverage multi-resolution occlusion masks to achieve more effective feature
fusion. Finally, additional auxiliary loss functions are designed to ensure
that there is a clear division of labor in the network modules, encouraging the
network to generate high-quality images. Our method can animate a variety of

($\alpha_0$ = 79.95 deg +0.22 -0.23, $\delta_0$ = -69.31 deg +0.12 -0.11) that
is in agreement with that resulting from Hubble Space Telescope data. The
inferred viewing angles of the LMC disc (i = 33.5 deg +1.2 -1.3, $\Theta$ =

a higher rotation amplitude for the young ($\lesssim$0.5~Gyr) stars compared to

asymmetric drift. We constructed spatially resolved velocity maps of the

90%. It also exhibits excellent antimicrobial performance in inhibiting the
growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (E.coli and

the cellulose film shows nearly 100% resistance to skin scraping in dry

development process. Improvements in the brightness of lab-based X-ray
micro-sources in combination with the development of new metrology methods, and
in particular ptychographic X-ray speckle tracking, enable characterization of
X-ray optics in the lab with a precision and sensitivity not possible before.
Here, we present a laboratory set-up that utilizes a commercially available
X-ray source and can be used to characterize different types of X-ray optics.
The set-up is used in our laboratory on a routine basis to characterize
multilayer Laue lenses of high numerical aperture and other optical elements.
This typically includes measurements of the wavefront distortions, optimum
operating photon energy and focal length of the lens. To check the sensitivity
and accuracy of this laboratory set-up we compared the results to those
obtained at the synchrotron and saw no significant difference. To illustrate
the feedback of measurements on performance, we demonstrated the correction of
the phase errors of a particular multilayer Laue lens using a 3D printed
compound refractive phase plate.

Abstract shortened to fit arXiv requirements",,"10.1109/FOCS52979.2021.00069",,"cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  For a complexity class $C$ and language $L$, a constructive separation of $L
\notin C$ gives an efficient algorithm (also called a refuter) to find
counterexamples (bad inputs) for every $C$-algorithm attempting to decide $L$.
We study the questions: Which lower bounds can be made constructive? What are
the consequences of constructive separations? We build a case that
""constructiveness"" serves as a dividing line between many weak lower bounds we
know how to prove, and strong lower bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$. Put
another way, constructiveness is the opposite of a complexity barrier: it is a
property we want lower bounds to have. Our results fall into three broad
categories.
  1. Our first set of results shows that, for many well-known lower bounds
against streaming algorithms, one-tape Turing machines, and query complexity,
as well as lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, making these
lower bounds constructive would imply breakthrough separations ranging from
$EXP \neq BPP$ to even $P \neq NP$.
  2. Our second set of results shows that for most major open problems in lower
bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$, including $P \neq NP$, $P \neq PSPACE$,
$P \neq PP$, $ZPP \neq EXP$, and $BPP \neq NEXP$, any proof of the separation
would further imply a constructive separation. Our results generalize earlier
results for $P \neq NP$ [Gutfreund, Shaltiel, and Ta-Shma, CCC 2005] and $BPP
\neq NEXP$ [Dolev, Fandina and Gutfreund, CIAC 2013].
  3. Our third set of results shows that certain complexity separations cannot
be made constructive. We observe that for all super-polynomially growing
functions $t$, there are no constructive separations for detecting high
$t$-time Kolmogorov complexity (a task which is known to be not in $P$) from
any complexity class, unconditionally.

forceful fingertip haptic interface is challenging due to trade-offs among
miniaturization, multifunctionality, and manufacturability. Downsizing
electromagnetic actuators that produce high torques is infeasible, and
integrating multiple actuators, links, joints, and transmission elements
increases device size and weight. 3-D printing enables rapid manufacturing of
complex devices with minimal assembly in large batches. However, it requires a
careful arrangement of material properties, geometry, scale, and printer
capabilities. Here we present a fully 3-D printed, soft, monolithic fingertip
haptic device based on an origami pattern known as the ""waterbomb"" base that
embeds foldable vacuum actuation and produces 4-DoF of motion on the fingerpad

25 N-mm). Including the thimble mounting, the compact device is 40 mm long and

the practice is severely limited by high computational costs in the rendering

can render an editable free-view video of a human performer in real-time. It
separates the high-frequency (i.e., non-smooth) human appearance from the 3D
volume, and encodes them into 2D neural texture stacks (NTS). The smooth UV
volumes allow much smaller and shallower neural networks to obtain densities
and texture coordinates in 3D while capturing detailed appearance in 2D NTS.
For editability, the mapping between the parameterized human model and the
smooth texture coordinates allows us a better generalization on novel poses and
shapes. Furthermore, the use of NTS enables interesting applications, e.g.,
retexturing. Extensive experiments on CMU Panoptic, ZJU Mocap, and H36M

though rarely investigated, as different downstream tasks (e.g., general and
fine-grained classification) often require different or multi-granular
features, e.g.~fine- or coarse-grained one or their mixture. In this work, for
the first time, we propose an effective MUlti-Granular Self-supervised learning
(Mugs) framework to explicitly learn multi-granular visual features. Mugs has
three complementary granular supervisions: 1) an instance discrimination
supervision (IDS), 2) a novel local-group discrimination supervision (LGDS),
and 3) a group discrimination supervision (GDS). IDS distinguishes different
instances to learn instance-level fine-grained features. LGDS aggregates
features of an image and its neighbors into a local-group feature, and pulls
local-group features from different crops of the same image together and push
them away for others. It provides complementary instance supervision to IDS via
an extra alignment on local neighbors, and scatters different local-groups
separately to increase discriminability. Accordingly, it helps learn high-level
fine-grained features at a local-group level. Finally, to prevent similar
local-groups from being scattered randomly or far away, GDS brings similar
samples close and thus pulls similar local-groups together, capturing
coarse-grained features at a (semantic) group level. Consequently, Mugs can
capture three granular features that often enjoy higher generality on diverse
downstream tasks over single-granular features, e.g.~instance-level
fine-grained features in contrastive learning. By only pretraining on
ImageNet-1K, Mugs sets new SoTA linear probing accuracy 82.1$\%$ on ImageNet-1K

to turn Brazil into a self-sufficient country in the production of

describes other applications as irradiation and testing of nuclear fuels and
structural material analysis, for instance. There are many techniques in the
project to study structural aspects of materials, where neutron diffraction
represents one of the priorities for implementation. This technique will take
place mainly on two diffractometers on Thermal Neutron Guide 1 (TG1), namely
Araponga, a high-resolution diffractometer, and Flautim, a high-intensity
diffractometer. In this work, we study the performance of the Araponga
diffractometer through McStas simulations with input produced by the MCNP code
of the RMB core. We investigate the neutron flux values considering a
state-of-art high-resolution diffractometer, and the results are promising
since some simulated scenarios present values compatible with high-intensity

the (p)reheating era can act as a novel probe of the non-thermal dark matter
production in the early Universe. Such scenarios are of utmost interest when no
other interaction between the visible and dark sectors is present, therefore
having no other detectability prospects. We consider the remnant energy in the
coherently oscillating inflaton zeroth mode to contribute as the observed relic
dark matter density in the Universe. To fully capture the nonlinear dynamics
and the effects of back-reactions during the oscillation, we resort to fully
nonlinear lattice simulation with pseudo-spectral methods to eliminate the
differencing noises. We investigate for models whose behavior during the
reheating era is of quadratic ($m_{\Phi}^2\Phi^2$ type) and find the typical
primordial stochastic GW background (SGWB) spectrum from scatterings among
highly populated inflaton modes behaving like matter, as expected, during this
nonlinear phase. We predict the detectable dark matter mass ranges within the
future GW detectors such as BBO, DECIGO, PTA, AION-MAGIS, and CE to be (MeV -
TeV) ranges. We conclude that with the current and future GW detectors
operating at high frequencies one will be able to probe non-thermal dark matter
which is otherwise impossible to test at laboratories and astrophysical
searches due to feeble or no interaction among the visible and dark sectors.

perpendicular magnetic anisotropy system, an additional in-plane direction
magnetic field is essential for deterministic switching by breaking the
magnetization symmetry. Realizing chirality in a magnetic ordering system can
be one approach for achieving asymmetry in the lateral direction for field-free
magnetization switching. However, systematic analysis of the influence of the
chiral spin system on deterministic switching is still scarce. In this report,
the achievement of field-free SOT-induced magnetization switching by using a
chiral spin configuration is investigated by experiments and micromagnetic
simulations. We designed a system in which only part of the ferromagnetic layer
overlaps with the heavy metal layer in the Pt/Co/MgO structure. Therefore, a
spin current is exerted only on a local area of the ferromagnetic layer, which
results in a N\'eel-type chiral spin configuration. The induced chiral spin
configuration can be stabilized (or destabilized) depending on the sign of the
interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction of the system. The stabilized
spin configuration plays a crucial role in the deterministic switching in zero
field. We expect our findings to widen the perspective on chirality-based
all-electrical SOT device fabrication.

The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with staffing (i.e.,
employment), capacity allocation, over-staffing, and under-staffing. We propose
two-stage stochastic programming (SP) and distributionally robust optimization
(DRO) approaches to model and solve this problem considering two types of
decision-makers, namely an everything in advance decision-maker (EA) and a
flexible adjustment decision-maker (FA). In the EA models, we determine the
staffing and capacity allocation decisions in the first stage before observing
the demand. In the FA models, we decide the staffing decisions in the first

realizations in the second stage. We derive equivalent mixed-integer linear

EA decision-maker that can be implemented and efficiently solved using
off-the-shelf optimization software. We propose a computationally efficient
column-and-constraint generation algorithm with valid inequalities to solve the

numerical experiments comparing the operational and computational performance
of the proposed approaches and discuss insights and implications for home care

engineering. Several quantum methods for optimization have recently been
developed, in different settings including both exact and approximate solvers.
Addressing this field of research, this manuscript has three distinct purposes.
First, we present an intuitive method for synthesizing and analyzing discrete
(i.e., integer-based) optimization problems, wherein the problem and
corresponding algorithmic primitives are expressed using a discrete quantum
intermediate representation (DQIR) that is encoding-independent. This compact
representation often allows for more efficient problem compilation, automated
analyses of different encoding choices, easier interpretability, more complex
runtime procedures, and richer programmability, as compared to previous
approaches, which we demonstrate with a number of examples. Second, we perform
numerical studies comparing several qubit encodings; the results exhibit a
number of preliminary trends that help guide the choice of encoding for a
particular set of hardware and a particular problem and algorithm. Our study
includes problems related to graph coloring, the traveling salesperson problem,
factory/machine scheduling, financial portfolio rebalancing, and integer linear
programming. Third, we design low-depth graph-derived partial mixers (GDPMs) up
to 16-level quantum variables, demonstrating that compact (binary) encodings
are more amenable to QAOA than previously understood. We expect this toolkit of
programming abstractions and low-level building blocks to aid in designing
quantum algorithms for discrete combinatorial problems.

using the non-Abelian dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method and
perturbation theory. Upon doping a Kondo insulator, an electronic mode emerges
in the Kondo insulating gap, exhibiting the momentum-shifted magnetic
dispersion relation. Although the ground-state properties are similar to those
of a doped band insulator, the emergence of the electronic mode reflecting
spin-charge separation of the Kondo insulator is a crucial interaction effect
that allows us to regard the Kondo-insulator--metal transition as a type of

Such the assumption for the evaluation task does not suit some downstream

scenario, we propose Optimal Correction Cost (OC-cost), which assesses
detection accuracy at image level. OC-cost computes the cost of correcting
detections to ground truths as a measure of accuracy. The cost is obtained by
solving an optimal transportation problem between the detections and the ground
truths. Unlike mAP, OC-cost is designed to penalize false positive and false
negative detections properly, and every image in a dataset is treated equally.
Our experimental result validates that OC-cost has better agreement with human
preference than a ranking-based measure, i.e., mAP for a single image. We also
show that detectors' rankings by OC-cost are more consistent on different data
splits than mAP. Our goal is not to replace mAP with OC-cost but provide an
additional tool to evaluate detectors from another aspect. To help future
researchers and developers choose a target measure, we provide a series of

equatorial region of the Maryland impact crater or close to the Bright spots
area on the large lobe. Also, particles in a spherical cloud orbiting Arrokoth
accumulate preferentially near low-mid-latitudes regions close to the
longitudes of Maryland crater and Bright spots area. In contrast, a few
particles will fall in regions diametrically opposite to them, as in the
LL_Term boundary on the large lobe. High-latitudes are those more empty of
impacts, as in polar sites. In addition, particles larger than a couple of
microns are not significantly perturbed by solar radiation pressure in the

present results of a set of numerical simulations carried out to obtain
long-duration orbits for a probe around Titania. Through an expansion of the
gravitational potential up to second order, the asymmetry of the gravitational
field due to Titania's coefficient $C_{22}$, the zonal coefficient $J_2$, and
the gravitational perturbation of Uranus is considered. The analysis of
lifetime sensitivity due to possible errors in the values of $J_2$ and $C_{22}$
is investigated using multiple regression models. Simulations were performed
for different eccentricity values, and lifetime maps were constructed. The
results show that low-altitude and near-circular orbits have longer lifetimes
due to the balance between the disturbance of Uranus and the gravitational
coefficients of Titania. The results also show that non-zero values of the
longitude of periapsis ($\omega$) and longitude of the ascending node
($\Omega$) are essential to increase the lifetime up to eight times compared to
cases where $\omega= \Omega=0^\circ$. We also show that an orbit with

spatial inconsistency and boundary confusion) produced by the existing

novel Decoupled Multi-task Learning with Cyclical Self-Regulation (DML-CSR) for
face parsing. Specifically, DML-CSR designs a multi-task model which comprises
face parsing, binary edge, and category edge detection. These tasks only share
low-level encoder weights without high-level interactions between each other,
enabling to decouple auxiliary modules from the whole network at the inference
stage. To address spatial inconsistency, we develop a dynamic dual graph
convolutional network to capture global contextual information without using
any extra pooling operation. To handle boundary confusion in both single and
multiple face scenarios, we exploit binary and category edge detection to
jointly obtain generic geometric structure and fine-grained semantic clues of
human faces. Besides, to prevent noisy labels from degrading model
generalization during training, cyclical self-regulation is proposed to
self-ensemble several model instances to get a new model and the resulting
model then is used to self-distill subsequent models, through alternating
iterations. Experiments show that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art

expensive matrix operations. Here, we propose an efficient quantum algorithm to
solve it based on a assumption that the element of each vertex and its norms
can be effectively accessed via a quantum random access memory data structure.
Specifically, we adopt the optimal Hamiltonian simulation technique based on
the block-encoding framework to implement the quantum simulation of the

matrix are extracted by the quantum phase estimation algorithm. The core of our
entire algorithm is to construct the block-encoding of the Laplacian matrix. To
achieve this, we propose in detail how to construct the block-encodings of
operators containing the information of the weight matrix and the degree matrix
respectively, and further obtain the block-encoding of the Laplacian matrix.
Compared with its classical counterpart, our algorithm has a polynomial speedup
on the number of vertices and an exponential speedup on the dimension of each
vertex. We also show that our algorithm can be extended to solve the
eigenproblem of symmetric (non-symmetric) normalized Laplacian matrix.

SC^2-PCR. Firstly, we propose a second order spatial compatibility (SC^2)
measure to compute the similarity between correspondences. It considers the
global compatibility instead of local consistency, allowing for more
distinctive clustering between inliers and outliers at early stage. Based on
this measure, our registration pipeline employs a global spectral technique to
find some reliable seeds from the initial correspondences. Then we design a
two-stage strategy to expand each seed to a consensus set based on the SC^2
measure matrix. Finally, we feed each consensus set to a weighted SVD algorithm
to generate a candidate rigid transformation and select the best model as the
final result. Our method can guarantee to find a certain number of outlier-free
consensus sets using fewer samplings, making the model estimation more
efficient and robust. In addition, the proposed SC^2 measure is general and can
be easily plugged into deep learning based frameworks. Extensive experiments
are carried out to investigate the performance of our method. Code will be

semimetals, the number of Fermi arcs at the system boundaries is determined by
the topological charge $J$, a direct consequence of the ""bulk-boundary""
correspondence principle. Analogously, we find that $J$ also modulates the bulk
Fano profile of the system with an embedded quantum impurity. Thus, by
increasing $J$, the Fano lineshape evolves from resonant, typical for $J=1$
(single Weyl), towards antiresonant, extrapolating to the so-called hyper Weyl
semimetals with $J\gg1$. Specially for the maximum case protected by the
rotational symmetry $C_{2J=6}$, namely the $J=3$ (triple Weyl), which acquires
asymmetric Fano profile, the Fano parameter absolute value is predicted to be
$\tan(C_{2J=6})$, where $C_{2J}\equiv(360^{\circ}/2J)$ defines the rotational
angle. Hence, the Fano discretization in the $J$ term introduces the
topological charge Fano effect in multi-Weyl semimetals. We also suggest a
transport device where we expect that the proposed Fano effect could be
detected.

to transition from quintessence to phantom. In addition, we show that the model

generate a rationale given the correct answer; fine-tune on all the rationales

significantly improves performance on multiple datasets compared to a model

fine-tuning a 30$\times$ larger state-of-the-art language model on

In all these applications, temperature-dependent material properties play an
important role and often adversely impact performance depending on the

modeling based on Mie scattering theory to investigate and compare the
temperature and polarization-dependent optical anisotropy of metallic (gold,

bandgap semiconducting nanowires. Results indicate that plasmonic scattering
resonances in semiconductors, within the absorption band, deteriorate with an
increase in temperature whereas those occurring away from the absorption band
strengthen as a result of the increase in phononic contribution.
Indirect-bandgap thin ($20 \,\mathrm{nm}$) Si nanowires present low absorption
efficiencies for both the transverse electric (TE, $E_{\perp}$) and magnetic
(TM, $E_{\parallel}$) modes, and high scattering efficiencies for the TM mode
at shorter wavelengths making them suitable as highly efficient scatterers.
Temperature-resilient higher-order anapole modes with their characteristic high
absorption and low scattering efficiencies are also observed in the
semiconductor nanowires ($r \! = \! 125 \! - \! 130$ nm) for the TE

offloading computation tasks is promising, the high traffic demands overwhelm

segmentation, as the lack of obvious and concentrated regions of interest
(RoIs) forces the adoption of uniform compression strategies, leading to low
compression ratios or accuracy. This paper introduces STAC, a DNN-driven
compression scheme tailored for edge-assisted semantic video segmentation. STAC
is the first to exploit DNN's gradients as spatial sensitivity metrics for
spatial adaptive compression and achieves superior compression ratio and
accuracy. Yet, it is challenging to adapt this content-customized compression
to videos. Practical issues include varying spatial sensitivity and huge
bandwidth consumption for compression strategy feedback and offloading. We
tackle these issues through a spatiotemporal adaptive scheme, which (1) takes
partial strategy generation operations offline to reduce communication load,
and (2) propagates compression strategies and segmentation results across
frames through dense optical flow, and adaptively offloads keyframes to
accommodate video content. We implement STAC on a commodity mobile device.
Experiments show that STAC can save up to 20.95% of bandwidth without losing
accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm.

storing, manipulating, and gaining insight from data. Evidence includes the
versatile set of machine learning, data visualization, and manipulation
packages used for the ever-growing size of available data. The Zen of Python is
a set of guiding design principles that developers use to write acceptable and
elegant Python code. Most principles revolve around simplicity. However, as the
need to compute large amounts of data, performance has become a necessity for
the Python programmer. The new idea in this paper is to confirm whether writing
the Pythonic way peaks performance at scale. As a starting point, we conduct a
set of preliminary experiments to evaluate nine Pythonic code examples by
comparing the performance of both Pythonic and Non-Pythonic code snippets. Our
results reveal that writing in Pythonic idioms may save memory and time. We
show that incorporating list comprehension, generator expression, zip, and
itertools.zip_longest idioms can save up to 7,000 MB and up to 32.25 seconds.

computer vision to physical modeling. Most previous methods struggle with
generality, simplicity, and expressiveness -- some are designed ad hoc for
specific data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacrifice
flexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework
to achieve equivariance for point cloud analysis based on the message passing
(graph neural network) scheme. We find the equivariant property could be
obtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative
position for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud.
Therefore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns
orientations for each point. Before aggregating information from the neighbors
of a point, the networks transforms the neighbors' coordinates based on the
point's learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance
of the proposed framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our proposed method
is competitive on both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks. Code

examined, applying complex network analysis. Results indicate that, although
the secured market has less participants, its nodes are more densely connected
than in the unsecured market. The interrelationships in the unsecured market
are less stable, making its structure more volatile and vulnerable to negative
shocks. The analysis identifies two 'hidden' underlying sub-networks within the
REPO market: one based on the transactions collateralized by Treasury bonds
(REPO-T) and other based on the operations collateralized by Central Bank (CB)
securities (REPO-CB). The changes in monetary policy stance and monetary
conditions seem to have a substantially smaller impact in the former than in
the latter 'sub-market'. The connectivity levels within the REPO-T market and
its structure remain relatively unaffected by the (in some period pronounced)
swings in the other segment of the market. Hence, the REPO market shows signs
of fragmentation in its inner structure, according to the type of collateral
asset involved in the transactions, so the average REPO interest rate reflects
the interplay between these two partially fragmented sub-markets. This mixed
structure of the REPO market entails one of the main sources of differentiation
with respect to the CALL market.

($\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$) and Chern-Simons theory by constructing the anisotropic
black D3-brane solution in IIB supergravity. The deformed bulk geometry is
obtained by performing a double Wick rotation and dimension reduction which
becomes an anisotropic bubble configuration exhibiting confinement in the dual
theory. And its anisotropy also reduces to a Chern-Simons term due to the
presence of the dissolved D7-branes or the axion field in bulk. Using the
bubble geometry, we investigate the the ground-state energy density, quark
potential, entanglement entropy and the baryon vertex according to the standard
methods in the AdS/CFT dictionary. Our calculation shows that the ground-state
energy illustrates degenerate to the Chern-Simons coupling coefficient which is
in agreement with the properties of the gauge Chern-Simons theory. The behavior
of the quark tension, entanglement entropy and the embedding of the baryon
vertex further implies strong anisotropy may destroy the confinement.
Afterwards, we additionally introduce various D7-branes as flavor and
Chern-Simons branes to include the fundamental matter and effective
Chern-Simons level in the dual theory. By counting their orientation, we
finally obtain the associated topological phase in the dual theory and the
critical mass for the phase transition. Interestingly the formula of the
critical mass reveals the flavor symmetry, which may relate to the chiral
symmetry, would be restored if the anisotropy increases greatly. As all of the
analysis is consistent with characteristics of quark-gluon plasma, we therefore
believe our framework provides a remarkable way to understand the features of
Chern-Simons theory, the strong coupled nuclear matter and its deconfinement

the surface in the $\gamma$ phase. Here in our work, we circumvent this issue
by investigating the effect of alloying addition of La on Ce, by means of

phenomenological periodic Anderson model and a modified Anderson impurity

era in the understanding of how B-fields are organized in star forming regions,
unveiling an intricate interplay between the B-fields and the gas in

of solar-type star formation, it is key to be able to understand to what extent
these polarized dust emissions are good tracers of the B-field in the youngest
protostellar objects. We present a thorough investigation of the fidelity and
limitations of using dust polarized emission to map the B-field topologies in
low-mass protostars. To assess the importance of these effects, we performed
the analysis of B-field properties in 27 realizations of MHD models of
star-forming cores. Assuming a uniform population of dust grains whose sizes
follow the standard MRN, we analyze the synthetic polarized dust emission maps
produced if these grains align with the local B-field thanks to B-RATs. We find
that (sub-)millimeter polarized dust emission is a robust tracer of the B-field
topologies in inner protostellar envelopes and is successful at capturing the
details of the B-field spatial distribution down to radii ~100 au. Measurements
of the los averaged B-field orientation using the polarized dust emission are
precise to < 15{\deg} in about 75 - 95% of the independent lines of sight
peering through protostellar envelopes. Large discrepancies between the
integrated B-field mean orientation and the orientation reconstructed from the
polarized dust emission are mostly observed in (i) lines of sight where the
B-field is highly disorganized and (ii) lines of sight probing large column

of the growth schedule to sub-network architecture optimization problem, then
propose one-shot estimation of the sub-network performance via an elastic
supernet. The searching overhead is reduced to minimal by recycling the

addition, the quantification of estimation uncertainty remains a challenge. We
develop a general approach to statistical inference for heterogeneous treatment

sampling framework to a common setting, in which researchers use an ML
algorithm to estimate the conditional average treatment effect and then divide
the sample into several groups based on the magnitude of the estimated effects.
We show how to estimate the average treatment effect within each of these
groups, and construct a valid confidence interval. In addition, we develop
nonparametric tests of treatment effect homogeneity across groups, and
rank-consistency of within-group average treatment effects. The validity of our
methodology does not rely on the properties of ML algorithms because it is
solely based on the randomization of treatment assignment and random sampling
of units. Finally, we generalize our methodology to the cross-fitting procedure
by accounting for the additional uncertainty induced by the random splitting of

approach that facilitates data-efficient high-quality video re-synthesis by
optimizing low-dimensional edits of a single Identity-latent. The approach
builds on StyleGAN2 image inversion and multi-stage non-linear latent-space
editing to generate videos that are nearly comparable to input videos. While
existing StyleGAN latent-based editing techniques focus on simply generating
plausible edits of static images, we automate the latent-space editing to
capture the fine expressive facial deformations in a sequence of frames using
an encoding that resides in the Style-latent-space (StyleSpace) of StyleGAN2.
The encoding thus obtained could be super-imposed on a single Identity-latent

economically captures face identity, head-pose, and complex expressive facial
motions at fine levels, and thereby bypasses training, person modeling,
dependence on landmarks/ keypoints, and low-resolution synthesis which tend to
hamper most re-enactment approaches. The approach is designed with maximum data

high-fidelity video rendering. This pipeline can also be used for puppeteering

Whitney spaces. Nodal elements impose both tangential and normal continuity of
vector or scalar fields across interface boundaries. But in edge elements only
tangential continuity is imposed across interface boundaries, which is
consistent with electromagnetic field problems. Therefore, the required
continuities in the electromagnetic analysis are directly obtained with edge
elements, whereas in nodal elements they are attained through potential
formulations. Hence, while using edge elements, field variables are directly
calculated, but with nodal elements, post-processing is required to obtain the
field variables from the potentials. Here, we present the finite element
formulations with the edge element as well as with nodal elements. Thereafter,
we have demonstrated the relative performances of different nodal and edge
elements through a series of examples. All possible complexities like curved
boundaries, non-convex domains, sharp corners, non-homogeneous domains have
been addressed in those examples. The robustness of edge elements in predicting
the singular eigen values for the domains with sharp edges and corners is
evident in the analysis. A better coarse mesh accuracy has been observed for
all the edge elements as compared to the respective nodal elements. Edge
elements are also not susceptible to mesh distortion.

dependence on large amounts of voxel-level annotated data is a disadvantage
that needs to be addressed given the high cost to obtain such annotation.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) solve this issue by training models with a large
unlabelled and a small labelled dataset. The most successful SSL approaches are
based on consistency learning that minimises the distance between model
responses obtained from perturbed views of the unlabelled data. These
perturbations usually keep the spatial input context between views fairly
consistent, which may cause the model to learn segmentation patterns from the
spatial input contexts instead of the segmented objects. In this paper, we
introduce the Translation Consistent Co-training (TraCoCo) which is a
consistency learning SSL method that perturbs the input data views by varying
their spatial input context, allowing the model to learn segmentation patterns
from visual objects. Furthermore, we propose the replacement of the commonly
used mean squared error (MSE) semi-supervised loss by a new Cross-model
confident Binary Cross entropy (CBC) loss, which improves training convergence
and keeps the robustness to co-training pseudo-labelling mistakes. We also
extend CutMix augmentation to 3D SSL to further improve generalisation. Our
TraCoCo shows state-of-the-art results for the Left Atrium (LA) and Brain Tumor

high-accuracy 6D pose estimation results becomes a better option.
State-of-the-art approaches typically use different backbones to extract
features for RGB and depth images. They use a 2D CNN for RGB images and a
per-pixel point cloud network for depth data, as well as a fusion network for
feature fusion. We find that the essential reason for using two independent
backbones is the ""projection breakdown"" problem. In the depth image plane, the
projected 3D structure of the physical world is preserved by the 1D depth value
and its built-in 2D pixel coordinate (UV). Any spatial transformation that
modifies UV, such as resize, flip, crop, or pooling operations in the CNN
pipeline, breaks the binding between the pixel value and UV coordinate. As a
consequence, the 3D structure is no longer preserved by a modified depth image
or feature. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method
denoted as Uni6D that explicitly takes the extra UV data along with RGB-D
images as input. Our method has a Unified CNN framework for 6D pose estimation
with a single CNN backbone. In particular, the architecture of our method is
based on Mask R-CNN with two extra heads, one named RT head for directly
predicting 6D pose and the other named abc head for guiding the network to map
the visible points to their coordinates in the 3D model as an auxiliary module.
This end-to-end approach balances simplicity and accuracy, achieving comparable

IRS, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
required by communication users, the minimum SINR required by the radar, and
the cross-correlation pattern design. In particular, we consider two cases,
namely, case I and case II, based on the presence or absence of the radar
cross-correlation design and the interference introduced by the IRS on the
Radcom BS. For case I where the cross correlation design and the interference
are not considered, we prove that the dedicated radar signals are not needed,
which significantly reduces implementation complexity and simplifies algorithm
design. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting
non-convex optimization problem. Whereas for case II considering the

the resulting optimization problem is more challenging to solve as compared

suppresses the informative knowledge of data via minimizing the corresponding

This explains the vulnerability of error-minimizing noise in adversarial

introduced to reduce the adversarial training loss. Experiments show that the

a good agreement between atmospheric parameters of OBAF-type stars when

labels the APOGEE spectra are (far) less informative than the BOSS spectra of
these stars, while log(g), v*sin(i), and [M/H] are in most cases too uncertain

efficient performance in terms of compression ratio and time for linear-algebra
operations. Experiments show that, as a compressor, our tool is clearly
superior to gzip and it is usually within 20% of xz in terms of compression
ratio. In addition, our compressed format supports matrix-vector
multiplications in time and space proportional to the size of the compressed
representation, unlike gzip and xz that require the full decompression of the
compressed matrix. To our knowledge our lossless compressor is the first one
achieving time and space complexities which match the theoretical limit
expressed by the $k$-th order statistical entropy of the input.

scales poorly to large scale corpora. In this paper, we treat aspect-based
similarity as a classical vector similarity problem in aspect-specific
embedding spaces. We represent a document not as a single generic embedding but
as multiple specialized embeddings. Our approach avoids document segmentation
and scales linearly w.r.t.the corpus size. In an empirical study, we use the
Papers with Code corpus containing 157,606 research papers and consider the
task, method, and dataset of the respective research papers as their aspects.
We compare and analyze three generic document embeddings, six specialized
document embeddings and a pairwise classification baseline in the context of
research paper recommendations. As generic document embeddings, we consider
FastText, SciBERT, and SPECTER. To compute the specialized document embeddings,
we compare three alternative methods inspired by retrofitting, fine-tuning, and
Siamese networks. In our experiments, Siamese SciBERT achieved the highest
scores. Additional analyses indicate an implicit bias of the generic document
embeddings towards the dataset aspect and against the method aspect of each
research paper. Our approach of aspect-based document embeddings mitigates
potential risks arising from implicit biases by making them explicit.

data; hence, label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data
negatively impacts the generalization performance of deep neural networks. To
combat label noise, recent state-of-the-art methods employ some sort of sample
selection mechanism to select a possibly clean subset of data. Next, an
off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning method is used for training where
rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. Our comprehensive analysis
shows that current selection methods disproportionately select samples from
easy (fast learnable) classes while rejecting those from relatively harder
ones. This creates class imbalance in the selected clean set and in turn,
deteriorates performance under high label noise. In this work, we propose
UNICON, a simple yet effective sample selection method which is robust to high
label noise. To address the disproportionate selection of easy and hard
samples, we introduce a Jensen-Shannon divergence based uniform selection
mechanism which does not require any probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter
tuning. We complement our selection method with contrastive learning to further
combat the memorization of noisy labels. Extensive experimentation on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of UNICON; we obtain an 11.4%
improvement over the current state-of-the-art on CIFAR100 dataset with a 90%

Most widely-used CL methods rely on a rehearsal memory of data points to be
reused while training on new data. Curating such a rehearsal memory to maintain
a small, informative subset of all the data seen so far is crucial to the
success of these methods. We devise a coreset selection method for
rehearsal-based continual learning. Our method is based on the idea of gradient
matching: The gradients induced by the coreset should match, as closely as
possible, those induced by the original training dataset. Inspired by the
neural tangent kernel theory, we perform this gradient matching across the
model's initialization distribution, allowing us to extract a coreset without
having to train the model first. We evaluate the method on a wide range of
continual learning scenarios and demonstrate that it improves the performance
of rehearsal-based CL methods compared to competing memory management
strategies such as reservoir sampling.

Transportation System (ITS) and Cooperative Vehicle Infrastructure System
(CVIS), which is usually achieved by monocular 3D vehicle detection. However,
depth information cannot be obtained directly by monocular cameras due to the
inherent imaging mechanism, resulting in more challenging monocular 3D tasks.
Most of the current monocular 3D vehicle detection methods leverage 2D
detectors and additional geometric modules, which reduces the efficiency. In
this paper, we propose a 3D vehicle localization network CenterLoc3D for
roadside monocular cameras, which directly predicts centroid and eight vertexes
in image space, and the dimension of 3D bounding boxes without 2D detectors. To
improve the precision of 3D vehicle localization, we propose a weighted-fusion
module and a loss with spatial constraints embedded in CenterLoc3D. Firstly,
the transformation matrix between 2D image space and 3D world space is solved
by camera calibration. Secondly, vehicle type, centroid, eight vertexes, and
the dimension of 3D vehicle bounding boxes are obtained by CenterLoc3D.
Finally, centroid in 3D world space can be obtained by camera calibration and
CenterLoc3D for 3D vehicle localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of 3D vehicle localization for roadside monocular
cameras. Hence, we also propose a benchmark for this application including a
dataset (SVLD-3D), an annotation tool (LabelImg-3D), and evaluation metrics.
Through experimental validation, the proposed method achieves high accuracy and
real-time performance. (limited words, please see the article for more details)

by the single-scale alignment for restoration. However, they typically suffer
from misalignment caused by severe blur. In this work, we aim to better utilize
neighboring frames with high efficient feature alignment. We propose a Pyramid
Feature Alignment Network (PFAN) for video deblurring. First, the multi-scale
feature of blurry frames is extracted with the strategy of Structure-to-Detail
Downsampling (SDD) before alignment. This downsampling strategy makes the edges
sharper, which is helpful for alignment. Then we align the feature at each
scale and reconstruct the image at the corresponding scale. This strategy
effectively supervises the alignment at each scale, overcoming the problem of
propagated errors from the above scales at the alignment stage. To better
handle the challenges of complex and large motions, instead of aligning
features at each scale separately, lower-scale motion information is used to
guide the higher-scale motion estimation. Accordingly, a Cascade Guided
Deformable Alignment (CGDA) is proposed to integrate coarse motion into
deformable convolution for finer and more accurate alignment. As demonstrated
in extensive experiments, our proposed PFAN achieves superior performance with
competitive speed compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

IQA model, which are then fed into another windowed transformer architecture
for video quality assessment (VQA). The VQA model efficiently reuses attention

diffusion-weighted images (DWI) with high spatial resolution and low

between shots. In this work, we aim at solving the challenging reconstructions
under inter-shot motions between shots and a low signal-to-noise ratio.
Methods: An explicit phase model with paired phase and magnitude priors is
proposed to regularize the reconstruction (PAIR). The former prior is derived
from the smoothness of the shot phase and enforced with low-rankness in the
k-space domain. The latter explores similar edges among multi-b-value and
multi-direction DWI with weighted total variation in the image domain. Results:
Extensive simulation and in vivo results show that PAIR can remove ghost
artifacts very well under a high number of shots (8 shots) and significantly
suppress the noise under the ultra-high b-value (4000 s/mm2). Conclusion: The
explicit phase model PAIR with complementary priors has a good performance on
challenging reconstructions under inter-shot motions between shots and a low
signal-to-noise ratio. Significance: PAIR has great potential in advanced
clinical DWI applications and brain function research.

attack detection (PAD) has attracted attention recently with its robustness
against unseen attack scenarios. Existing DA/DG-based PAD methods, however,
have not yet fully explored the domain-specific style information that can
provide knowledge regarding attack styles (e.g., materials, background,
illumination and resolution). In this paper, we introduce a novel Style-Guided
Domain Adaptation (SGDA) framework for inference-time adaptive PAD.
Specifically, Style-Selective Normalization (SSN) is proposed to explore the
domain-specific style information within the high-order feature statistics. The
proposed SSN enables the adaptation of the model to the target domain by
reducing the style difference between the target and the source domains.
Moreover, we carefully design Style-Aware Meta-Learning (SAML) to boost the
adaptation ability, which simulates the inference-time adaptation with style
selection process on virtual test domain. In contrast to previous domain
adaptation approaches, our method does not require either additional auxiliary
models (e.g., domain adaptors) or the unlabeled target domain during training,
which makes our method more practical to PAD task. To verify our experiments,
we utilize the public datasets: MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, OULU-NPU and Idiap
REPLAYATTACK. In most assessments, the result demonstrates a notable gap of
performance compared to the conventional DA/DG-based PAD methods.

$\mbox{dep}(G)=\max\limits_{e\in E(G)}d_{G}(e)$ is called the spanning tree

$p/q\in (0,1)$, if there exists a graph $G$ and an edge $e\in E(G)$ such that
$d_{G}(e)=p/q$, then we say the density $p/q$ is constructible. More specially,
if there exists a graph $G$ such that $\mbox{dep}(G)=p/q$, then we say the

the open problem of which rational densities and dependences are constructible.
In 2016, Kahl provided constructions that show all rational densities and
dependences are constructible. Moreover, He showed that all rational densities
are constructible even if $G$ is restricted to bipartite graphs or planar
graphs. He thus conjectured that all rational dependences are also
constructible even if $G$ is restricted to bipartite graphs (Conjecture 1), or
planar graphs (Conjecture 2). In this paper, by combinatorial and electric
network approach, firstly, we show that all rational dependences are
constructible via bipartite graphs, which confirms the first conjecture of
Kahl. Secondly, we show that all rational dependences are constructible for
planar multigraphs, which confirms Kahl's second conjecture for planar
multigraphs. However, for (simple) planar graphs, we disprove the second
conjecture of Kahl by showing that the dependence of any planar graph is larger
than $\frac{1}{3}$. On the other hand, we construct a family of planar graphs
that show all rational dependences $p/q>\frac{1}{2}$ are constructible via
planar graphs.

computational demand of mobile users. This potential mainly stems from the
capacity of task offloading and allocation at the network edge, which reduces
the delay and improves the quality of service. Despite the significant
potential, optimizing the performance of a fog network is often challenging. In
the fog architecture, the computing nodes are heterogeneous smart devices with
distinct abilities and capacities, thereby, preferences. Besides, in an
ultra-dense fog network with random task arrival, centralized control results
in excessive overhead, and therefore, it is not feasible. We study a
distributed task allocation problem in a heterogeneous fog computing network
under uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a social-concave game, where the
players attempt to minimize their regret on the path to Nash equilibrium. To
solve the formulated problem, we develop two no-regret decision-making
strategies. One strategy, namely bandit gradient ascent with momentum, is an
online convex optimization algorithm with bandit feedback. The other strategy,
Lipschitz Bandit with Initialization, is an EXP3 multi-armed bandit algorithm.
We establish a regret bound for both strategies and analyze their convergence
characteristics. Moreover, we compare the proposed strategies with a
centralized allocation strategy named Learning with Linear Rewards. Theoretical
and numerical analysis shows the superior performance of the proposed
strategies for efficient task allocation compared to the state-of-the-art

control of the density $n_{e}$ of the two-dimensional electron system in the QW
and that ($n_\text{SL}$) of excess electrons in the modulation-doping

fixed $n_{e}$, we observe a decrease in the apparent energy gap of the FQHEs
deduced from thermal activation, which signifies a corresponding increase in
the disorder broadening $\Gamma$ of composite fermions (CFs). Interestingly,
the increase in $\Gamma$ is accompanied by a noticeable increase in the
longitudinal resistivity at $\nu = 1/2$ ($\rho_{1/2}$), with a much stronger
correlation with $\Gamma$ than electron mobility $\mu$ has. The in-situ control

theoretical framework that can be utilized to estimate the performance of a
neural architecture at initialization. In this work, we revisit several
at-initialization metrics that can be derived from the NTK and reveal their key
shortcomings. Then, through the empirical analysis of the time evolution of
NTK, we deduce that modern neural architectures exhibit highly non-linear
characteristics, making the NTK-based metrics incapable of reliably estimating
the performance of an architecture without some amount of training. To take
such non-linear characteristics into account, we introduce Label-Gradient
Alignment (LGA), a novel NTK-based metric whose inherent formulation allows it
to capture the large amount of non-linear advantage present in modern neural
architectures. With minimal amount of training, LGA obtains a meaningful level
of rank correlation with the post-training test accuracy of an architecture.
Lastly, we demonstrate that LGA, complemented with few epochs of training,
successfully guides existing search algorithms to achieve competitive search

surfaces in $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$ having an isolated Cauchy-Riemann (CR)
singularity at the origin. These are perturbations of {\it Bishop quadrics}.
There are two kinds of CR singularities stable under perturbation~: {\it
elliptic} and {\it hyperbolic}. Elliptic case was studied by Moser-Webster
\cite{moser-webster} who showed that such a surface is locally, near the CR
singularity, holomorphically equivalent to {\it normal form} from which lots of
geometric features can be read off.
  In this article we focus on perturbations of {\it hyperbolic} quadrics. As
was shown by Moser-Webster \cite{moser-webster}, such a surface can be
transformed to a formal {\it normal form} by a formal change of coordinates
that may not be holomorphic in any neighborhood of the origin.
  Given a {\it non-degenerate} real analytic surface $M$ in $(\mathbb{C}^2,0)$
having a {\it hyperbolic} CR singularity at the origin, we prove the existence
of a non-constant Whitney smooth family of connected holomorphic curves
intersecting $M$ along holomorphic hyperbolas. This is the very first result
concerning hyperbolic CR singularity not equivalent to quadrics.
  This is a consequence of a non-standard KAM-like theorem for pair of germs of
holomorphic involutions $\{\tau_1,\tau_2\}$ at the origin, a common fixed
point. We show that such a pair has large amount of invariant analytic sets
biholomorphic to $\{z_1z_2=const\}$ (which is not a torus) in a neighborhood of
the origin, and that they are conjugate to restrictions of linear maps on such
invariant sets.

in 60 GHz band is elaborated, and the sensing performance is investigated in an
application of hand gesture recognition. Specifically, in this integrated
system, there are two radio frequency (RF) chains at the receiver and one at
the transmitter. Each RF chain is connected with one phased array for analog
beamforming. To facilitate simultaneous sensing and communication, the
transmitter delivers one stream of information-bearing signals via two beam
lobes, one is aligned with the main signal propagation path and the other is
directed to the sensing target. Signals from the two lobes are received by the
two RF chains at the receiver, respectively. By cross ambiguity coherent
processing, the time-Doppler spectrograms of hand gestures can be obtained.
Relying on the passive sensing system, a dataset of received signals, where
three types of hand gestures are sensed, is collected by using Line-of-Sight
(LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) paths as the reference channel respectively.
Then a neural network is trained by the dataset for motion detection. It is
shown that the classification accuracy rate is high as long as sufficient
sensing time is assured. Finally, an empirical model characterizing the
relation between the classification accuracy and sensing duration is derived
analytically.

integrable quantum many-body systems relax after a quantum quench, is based
upon the principle of maximum entropy. In contrast, there are no universal and
model-independent laws that govern the relaxation dynamics and stationary
states of open quantum systems, which are subjected to Markovian drive and
dissipation. Yet, as we show, relaxation of driven-dissipative systems after a
quantum quench can, in fact, be determined by a maximum entropy ensemble, if
the Liouvillian that generates the dynamics of the system has parity-time
symmetry. Focusing on the specific example of a driven-dissipative Kitaev
chain, we show that, similarly to isolated integrable systems, the approach to
a parity-time symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble becomes manifest in the
relaxation of local observables and the dynamics of subsystem entropies. In
contrast, the directional pumping of fermion parity, which is induced by
nontrivial non-Hermitian topology of the Kitaev chain, represents a phenomenon
that is unique to relaxation dynamics in driven-dissipative systems. Upon
increasing the strength of dissipation, parity-time symmetry is broken at a
finite critical value, which thus constitutes a sharp dynamical transition that
delimits the applicability of the principle of maximum entropy. We show that
these results, which we obtain for the specific example of the Kitaev chain,

calm solar wind intervals, and assess the precision of the Parker model as a
function of distance to the Sun. We then assume that the solar wind is composed
of two populations, the background calm solar wind and the population of SB,
characterized by larger fluctuations. We model the total distribution of
deflection angles we observe in the solar wind as a weighed sum of two distinct
normal distributions, each corresponding to one of the populations. We fit the
observed data with our model using a MCMC algorithm and retrieve the most
probable mean vector and covariance matrix coefficients of the two Gaussian
functions, as well as the population proportion. We first observe that the
accuracy of the spiral direction in the ecliptic is a function of radial
distance, in a manner that is consistent with PSP being near the solar wind
acceleration region. We then find that the fitted switchback population
presents a systematic bias in its deflections compared to the calm solar wind
population. This result holds for all encounters but E6, and regardless of the

SB in the clockwise direction in the ecliptic plane, and we discuss this result

To improve user comfort, preserve data privacy, and reduce the system's

microcontroller units (MCUs) embedded on edge devices to process the
electroencephalographic (EEG) data in real-time close to the sensors. However,
most of the classification models present in the literature are too
resource-demanding, making them unfit for low-power MCUs. This paper proposes
an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) for EEG-based MI classification
that achieves comparable accuracy while being orders of magnitude less
resource-demanding and significantly more energy-efficient than
state-of-the-art (SoA) models for a long-lifetime battery operation. To further
reduce the model complexity, we propose an automatic channel selection method
based on spatial filters and quantize both weights and activations to 8-bit
precision with negligible accuracy loss. Finally, we implement and evaluate the
proposed models on leading-edge parallel ultra-low-power (PULP) MCUs. The final
2-class solution consumes as little as 30 uJ/inference with a runtime of 2.95
ms/inference and an accuracy of 82.51% while using 6.4x fewer EEG channels,
becoming the new SoA for embedded MI-BMI and defining a new Pareto frontier in

start from a microscopic description of the interactions between a large but
finite number of small bubbles with a surrounding compressible fluid. This
microscopic model has been derived and analysed in the first paper. In the
present one, provided physical parameters scale according to the number of
bubbles, we prove that solutions to the microscopic model exist on a timespan
independent of the number of bubbles. Considering then that we have a large
number of bubbles, we propose a construction of the macroscopic variables and
derive the averaged system satisfied by these quantities. Our method is based
on a compactness approach in a strong-solution setting. In the last section, we
propose the derivation of the Williams-Boltzmann equation corresponding to our
setting.

pass on biases present in society to NLP solutions. Many papers attempted to
quantify bias in word or sentence embeddings to evaluate debiasing methods or
compare different embedding models, often with cosine-based scores. However,
some works have raised doubts about these scores showing that even though they
report low biases, biases persist and can be shown with other tests. In fact,
there is a great variety of bias scores or tests proposed in the literature
without any consensus on the optimal solutions. We lack works that study the
behavior of bias scores and elaborate their advantages and disadvantages. In
this work, we will explore different cosine-based bias scores. We provide a
bias definition based on the ideas from the literature and derive novel
requirements for bias scores. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the
existing cosine-based scores and their limitations in order to show why these
scores fail to report biases in some situations. Finally, we propose a new bias
score, SAME, to address the shortcomings of existing bias scores and show
empirically that SAME is better suited to quantify biases in word embeddings.

(which are cellular automata that accept if and only if all cells
simultaneously accept) so that every cell changes its state not only dependent
on the states it sees in its neighborhood but also on an unbiased coin toss of
its own. The resulting model is dubbed probabilistic ACA (PACA). We consider
one- and two-sided error versions of the model (in the same spirit as the
classes $\mathsf{RP}$ and $\mathsf{BPP}$) and establish a separation between
the classes of languages they can recognize all the way up to $o(\sqrt{n})$
time. As a consequence, we have a $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound for
derandomizing constant-time two-sided error PACAs (using deterministic ACAs).
We also prove that derandomization of $T(n)$-time PACAs (to polynomial-time
deterministic cellular automata) for various regimes of $T(n) = \omega(\log n)$
implies non-trivial derandomization results for the class $\mathsf{RP}$ (e.g.,
$\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{RP}$). The main contribution is an almost full
characterization of the constant-time PACA classes: For one-sided error, the
class equals that of the deterministic model; that is, constant-time one-sided
error PACAs can be fully derandomized with only a constant multiplicative
overhead in time complexity. As for two-sided error, we identify a natural
class we call the linearly testable languages ($\mathsf{LLT}$) and prove that
the languages decidable by constant-time two-sided error PACAs are ""sandwiched""
in-between the closure of $\mathsf{LLT}$ under union and intersection and the
class of locally threshold testable languages ($\mathsf{LTT}$).

of trace O interstitials is beneficial, reducing the magnitude of bas<a> slip

Furthermore, we compare several domain adaptation approaches to tackle the

set of unlabeled CT image pairs which differ only in reconstruction kernels

becomes unstable by flutter-type instability at a critical flow velocity;
moreover, the pipe undergoes periodic self-excited oscillations in the

the magnetized pipe is exposed to an actuating parallel magnetic field. The
question arises as to whether the actuating magnetic field leads to lessening
the oscillation amplitude of the system in the post-flutter region. To answer
the question, the nonlinear responses of a fluid-conveying cantilevered hard

its residual magnetic flux density vary along its length. The mathematical

solved by employing the Galerkin technique in conjunction with the Runge-Kutta

Unlike interstellar ionising radiation, they can penetrate large column
densities of gas, and reach molecular cloud cores. By maintaining there a small

the plasma and the magnetic field, which in turn affects the dynamical
evolution of clouds and impacts on the process of star and planet formation.
The cosmic-ray ionisation of molecular hydrogen in interstellar clouds also

lines in a broad region of the electromagnetic spectrum, spanning from the

optical channels over Hollow Core Nested Antiresonant Nodeless Fibre (HC-NANF)
is experimentally explored for the first time in terms of achievable quantum
bit error rate (QBER), secret key rate (SKR) as well as classical signal bit
error rates (BER). A coexistence transmission of 1.6 Tbps is achieved for the
classical channels simultaneously with a quantum channel over a 2 km-long
HC-NANF with a total coexistence power of 0 dBm. To find the best and worst
wavelength position for the classical channels, we simulated different
classical channels bands with different spacing between the quantum and
classical channels considering the crosstalk generated from both Raman
scattering and four-wave-mixing (FWM) on the quantum channel. Following our
simulation, we numerically estimate the best (Raman spectrum dip) and worst
locations (Raman spectrum peak) of the classical channel with respect to its
impact on the performance on the quantum channel in terms of SKR and QBER. We
further implemented a testbed to experimentally test both single mode fibre
(SMF) and HC-NANF in the best and worst-case scenarios. In the best-case
scenario, the spacing between quantum and classical is 200 GHz (1.6 nm) with 50
GHz (0.4 nm) spacing between each classical channel. The SKR was preserved
without any noticeable changes when coexisting the quantum channel with eight
classical channels at 0 dBm total coexistence power in HC-NANF compared to a
significant drop of 73% when using SMF at -24 dBm total coexistence power which
is 250 times lower than the power used in HC-NANF. In the worst-case scenario
using the same powers, and with 1 THz (8 nm) spacing between quantum and
classical channels, the SKR dropped 10% using the HC-NANF, whereas in the SMF
the SKR plummeted to zero.

Initially, a ring is considered to be in an eigenstate, i.e. in a commensurate
configuration with equal site fillings and equal phase differences between
neighboring sites. Such a ring should exhibit a circulating current whose value
will depend on the initial, non-zero phase difference. The appearance of such
currents is a signature of an established coherence along the ring. If phase
difference falls between $\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$ and interparticle interaction in
condensates exceeds a critical interaction value $u_c$, the coherence is
supposed to be quickly destroyed because the system enters a chaotic regime due
to inherent instabilities. This is, however, only a part of the story. It turns
out that chaotic dynamics and resulting averaging of circular current to zero
is generally offset by a critical time-scale $t_c$, which is almost two orders
of magnitude larger than the one expected from the linear stability analysis.
We study the critical time-scale in detail in a broad parameter range.

acceleration algorithms with dynamic window sizes and optimized damping.
Although Anderson acceleration (AA) has been used for decades to speed up
nonlinear solvers in many applications, most authors are simply using and
analyzing the stationary version of Anderson acceleration (sAA) with fixed
window size and a constant damping factor. The behavior and potential of the
non-stationary version of Anderson acceleration methods remain an open
question. Since most efficient linear solvers use composable algorithmic
components. Similar ideas can be used for AA to solve nonlinear systems. Thus
in the present work, to develop non-stationary Anderson acceleration
algorithms, we first propose two systematic ways to dynamically alternate the
window size $m$ by composition. One simple way to package sAA(m) with sAA(n) in
each iteration is applying sAA(m) and sAA(n) separately and then average their
results. It is an additive composite combination. The other more important way
is the multiplicative composite combination, which means we apply sAA(m) in the
outer loop and apply sAA(n) in the inner loop. By doing this, significant gains
can be achieved. Secondly, to make AA to be a fully non-stationary algorithm,
we need to combine these strategies with our recent work on the non-stationary
Anderson acceleration algorithm with optimized damping (AAoptD), which is
another important direction of producing non-stationary AA and nice performance
gains have been observed. Moreover, we also investigate the rate of convergence
of these non-stationary AA methods under suitable assumptions. Finally, our
numerical results show that some of these proposed non-stationary Anderson
acceleration algorithms converge faster than the stationary sAA method and they
may significantly reduce the storage and time to find the solution in many
cases.

subsurface structure of the Earth. The dispersion property is usually measured
by using frequency-phase velocity (f-c) analysis and by picking phase
velocities from the obtained f-c spectrum. However, because of potential
contamination the f-c spectrum often has multimodalities at each frequency for
each mode. These introduce uncertainty and errors in the picked phase
velocities, and consequently the obtained shear velocity structure is biased.
To overcome this issue, in this study we introduce a new method which directly
uses the spectrum as data. We achieve this by solving the inverse problem in a
Bayesian framework and define a new likelihood function, the energy likelihood
function, which uses the spectrum energy to define data fit. We apply the new
method to a land dataset recorded by a dense receiver array, and compare the
results to those obtained using the traditional method. The results show that
the new method produces more accurate results since they better match
independent data from refraction tomography. This real-data application also
shows that it can be applied efficiently since it removes the need to pick
phase velocities, and with relatively little adjustment to current practice
since it uses standard f-c panels to define the likelihood. We therefore
recommend using the energy likelihood function rather than explicitly picking
phase velocities in surface wave dispersion inversion.

offline mapping approaches due to their simplicity, computational efficacy, and
ability to work with minimal parallel resources. However, they crucially depend
on the assumption of embedding spaces being approximately isomorphic i.e.

to poorer performance on low-resource and distant language pairs. In this
paper, we introduce a framework to learn CLWEs, without assuming isometry, for
low-resource pairs via joint exploitation of a related higher-resource
language. In our work, we first pre-align the low-resource and related language
embedding spaces using offline methods to mitigate the assumption of isometry.
Following this, we use joint training methods to develops CLWEs for the related
language and the target embed-ding space. Finally, we remap the pre-aligned
low-resource space and the target space to generate the final CLWEs. We show
consistent gains over current methods in both quality and degree of
isomorphism, as measured by bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) and eigenvalue
similarity respectively, across several language pairs: {Nepali, Finnish,

essential feature for a reliable modelization of the nuclear matter equation of
state (EoS). Phenomenological models that make use of energy density
functionals (EDFs) offer a convenient approach to account for the presence of
these bound states of nucleons when introduced as additional degrees of
freedom. However, in these models clusters dissolve, by construction, when the
nuclear saturation density is approached from below, revealing inconsistencies
with recent findings that evidence the existence of short-range correlations
(SRCs) even at larger densities.
  In this work, within the EDF framework, a novel approach is proposed to embed
SRCs within a relativistic mean-field model with density dependent couplings.
This is realized through the introduction of suitable in-medium modifications
of the cluster binding energy shifts, which are responsible for describing the
cluster dissolution. As a first exploratory step, the example of a
quasi-deuteron within the generalized relativistic density functional approach
is investigated.
  For the first time, suitable parameterizations of the cluster mass shift at
zero temperature are derived for all baryon densities. They are constrained by
experimental results for the effective deuteron fraction in nuclear matter near
saturation and by microscopic many-body calculations in the low-density limit.
The strength of the deuteron-meson couplings is assessed to be of crucial
importance. The findings of the present study represent a first step to improve
the description of nuclear matter and its EoS at supra-saturation densities in
EDFs by considering correlations in an effective way. Novel effects on some
thermodynamic quantities, such as the matter incompressibility, the symmetry
energy and its slope, are finally discerned and discussed.

scheme with low computational complexity. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
our proposed method requires less time-frequency resources in channel
acquisition as the complexity is independent to the total size of the RIS but

Large performance gains are confirmed in simulations, which proves the

up into four bins) and a sample of background submillimeter galaxies from
H-ATLAS with photometric redshifts in the range $1.2 < z < 4.0$. We model the
weak lensing signal within the halo model formalism and carry out a Markov

from the non-tomographic analysis are not stringent, there is a remarkable
improvement in terms of uncertainty reduction when tomography is adopted.
Moreover, with respect to the traditional ST triple of values from numerical
simulations, the results from the three-parameter fit predict a higher number

to capture local patterns in sequences, while also correlating them globally.

simultaneously performing voice conversion and language code-switching using
multilingual VQ-VAE speech synthesis in German, French, English and Italian. In
this paper, we utilize VQ code indices representing phone information from
VQ-VAE to perform code-switching and a VQ speaker code to perform voice
conversion in a single system with a neural vocoder. Our analysis examines
several aspects of code-switching including the number of language switches and
the number of words involved in each switch. We found that speech synthesis
quality degrades after increasing the number of language switches within an
utterance and decreasing the number of words. We also found some evidence of
accent transfer when performing voice conversion across languages as observed
when a speaker's original language differs from the language of a synthetic
target utterance. We present results from our listening tests and discuss the
inherent difficulties of assessing accent transfer in speech synthesis. Our
work highlights some of the limitations and strengths of using a
semi-supervised end-to-end system like VQ-VAE for handling multilingual

challenging and we suggest some directions for expanding work in this area.

schemes for phase-field optimal control problems. Specifically in the optimal
control minimization problem, a tracking-type cost functional is minimized to
steer the crack via the phase-field variable into a desired pattern. To achieve
such optimal solutions, Neumann type boundary conditions need to be determined.
First, a time discretization of the forward problem is derived using a
discontinuous Galerkin formulation. Here, a challenge is to include
regularization terms and the crack irreversibility constraint. The optimal
control setting is formulated by means of the Lagrangian approach from which
the primal part, adjoint, tangent and adjoint Hessian are derived. Herein the
overall Newton algorithm is based on a reduced approach by eliminating the
state constraint, namely the displacement and phase-field unknowns, but keeping
the control variable as the only unknown. From the low-order discontinuous
Galerkin discretization, adjoint time-stepping schemes are finally obtained.
Both our formulation and algorithmic developments are substantiated and
illustrated with six numerical experiments.

novel framework to group and refine the 3D instances. In practice, we first
learn an offset vector for each point and shift it to its predicted instance
center. To better group these points, we propose a Hierarchical Point Grouping
algorithm to merge the centrally aggregated points progressively. All points
are grouped into small clusters, which further gradually undergo another
clustering procedure to merge into larger groups. These multi-scale groups are
exploited for instance prediction, which is beneficial for predicting instances
with different scales. In addition, a novel MaskScoreNet is developed to
produce binary point masks of these groups for further refining the
segmentation results. Extensive experiments conducted on the ScanNetV2 and
S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For
instance, our approach achieves a 66.4\% mAP with the 0.5 IoU threshold on the

inverse, is its inverse also intransitive? This question is closely related to
the invariant subspace problem. Ever since Enflo's celebrated counterexample on
$\ell_1$ answered the invariant subspace problem in negative, the Banach space

non-Markovian behaviour is there implemented by replacing standard
thermalization strokes with so-called extremal thermal operations which cannot
be realized without the memory effects. The second one is a three-stroke engine
in which the cycle consists of two extremal thermal operations and a single
qubit rotation. It is shown that the non-Markovian Otto engine can generate
more work-per-cycle for a given efficiency than its Markovian counterpart,
whereas performance of both setups is superior to the three-stroke engine.
Furthermore, both the non-Markovian Otto engine and the three-stroke engine can
reduce the work fluctuations in comparison with the Markovian Otto engine, with
their relative advantage depending on the performance target. This demonstrates
the beneficial influence of non-Markovianity on both the average performance

improvements are made to the sensor design, modern event cameras are trending
toward higher and higher sensor resolutions, which result in higher bandwidth
and computational requirements on downstream tasks. Despite this trend, the
benefits of using high-resolution event cameras to solve standard computer
vision tasks are still not clear. In this work, we report the surprising
discovery that, in low-illumination conditions and at high speeds,
low-resolution cameras can outperform high-resolution ones, while requiring a
significantly lower bandwidth. We provide both empirical and theoretical
evidence for this claim, which indicates that high-resolution event cameras
exhibit higher per-pixel event rates, leading to higher temporal noise in
low-illumination conditions and at high speeds. As a result, in most cases,
high-resolution event cameras show a lower task performance, compared to lower
resolution sensors in these conditions. We empirically validate our findings
across several tasks, namely image reconstruction, optical flow estimation, and
camera pose tracking, both on synthetic and real data. We believe that these
findings will provide important guidelines for future trends in event camera
development.

explored in detail, especially with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), due to
difficulties in calibrating the data and accounting for instrumental leakage.
Here, using a unique method to correct the polarisation observations, we
explore the circular polarisation of different sub-types of solar type III
radio bursts and a type I noise storm observed with LOFAR, which occurred
during March-April 2019. We analysed six individual radio bursts from two
different dates. We present the first Stokes V low frequency images of the Sun
with LOFAR in tied-array mode observations. We find that the degree of circular
polarisation for each of the selected bursts increases with frequency for
fundamental emission, while this trend is either not clear or absent for
harmonic emission. The type III bursts studied, that are part of a
long--lasting type III storm, can have different senses of circular
polarisation, occur at different locations and have different propagation
directions. This indicates that the type III bursts forming a classical type
III storm do not necessarily have a common origin but instead they indicate the
existence of multiple, possibly unrelated, acceleration processes originating
from solar minimum active regions.

reduces the label noise by employing the complementary relationship between

the similarity of k-nearest neighbors between feature spaces to exploit the
reliable complementary relationship. Based on the cross agreement, we refine
pseudo-labels of global features by ensembling the predictions of part
features, which collectively alleviate the noise in global feature clustering.
We further refine pseudo-labels of part features by applying label smoothing
according to the suitability of given labels for each part. Thanks to the
reliable complementary information provided by the cross agreement score, our
PPLR effectively reduces the influence of noisy labels and learns
discriminative representations with rich local contexts. Extensive experimental

their internal prediction construction process is opaque and largely not
understood. In this work, we make a substantial step towards unveiling this
underlying prediction process, by reverse-engineering the operation of the
feed-forward network (FFN) layers, one of the building blocks of transformer
models. We view the token representation as a changing distribution over the
vocabulary, and the output from each FFN layer as an additive update to that
distribution. Then, we analyze the FFN updates in the vocabulary space, showing
that each update can be decomposed to sub-updates corresponding to single FFN
parameter vectors, each promoting concepts that are often human-interpretable.
We then leverage these findings for controlling LM predictions, where we reduce
the toxicity of GPT2 by almost 50%, and for improving computation efficiency
with a simple early exit rule, saving 20% of computation on average.

in the information retrieval community and search engine industry. The
classical paradigm mainly relies on the flat Euclidean geometry. In recent
years, hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature)
representation methods have shown their superiority to capture hierarchical and
cyclic data structures respectively. However, in industrial scenarios such as
e-commerce sponsored search platforms, the large-scale heterogeneous
query-item-advertisement interaction graphs often have multiple structures
coexisting. Existing methods either only consider a single geometry space, or
combine several spaces manually, which are incapable and inflexible to model
the complexity and heterogeneity in the real scenario. To tackle this
challenge, we present a web-scale Adaptive Mixed-Curvature ADvertisement
retrieval system (AMCAD) to automatically capture the complex and heterogeneous
graph structures in non-Euclidean spaces. Specifically, entities are
represented in adaptive mixed-curvature spaces, where the types and curvatures
of the subspaces are trained to be optimal combinations. Besides, an attentive
edge-wise space projector is designed to model the similarities between
heterogeneous nodes according to local graph structures and the relation types.
Moreover, to deploy AMCAD in Taobao, one of the largest ecommerce platforms
with hundreds of million users, we design an efficient two-layer online
retrieval framework for the task of graph based advertisement retrieval.
Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets and A/B tests on online traffic
are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

cryptocurrencies and services. Cryptocurrencies are used to securely send
payments online. Payments via the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, use
pseudonymous addresses that have limited privacy and anonymity guarantees.
Research has shown that this pseudonymity can be broken, allowing users to be
tracked using clustering and tagging heuristics. Such tracking allows crimes to
be investigated. If a user has coins stolen, investigators can track addresses
to identify the destination of the coins. This, combined with an explosion in
the popularity of blockchain, has led to a vast increase in new coins and
services. These offer new features ranging from coins focused on increased
anonymity to scams shrouded as smart contracts. In this study, we investigated
the extent to which transaction privacy has improved and whether users can
still be tracked in these new ecosystems. We began by analysing the
privacy-focused coin Zcash, a Bitcoin-forked cryptocurrency, that is considered
to have strong anonymity properties due to its background in cryptographic
research. We revealed that the user anonymity set can be considerably reduced
using heuristics based on usage patterns. Next, we analysed cross-chain
transactions collected from the exchange ShapeShift, revealing that users can
be tracked as they move across different ledgers. Finally, we present a
measurement study on the smart-contract pyramid scheme Forsage, a scam that
cycled $267 million USD (of Ethereum) within its first year, showing that at
least 88% of the participants in the scheme suffered a loss. The significance
of this study is the revelation that users can be tracked in newer

categories, but will not understand sketches existing in different test-time
distribution as a result. We thus extend ZS-SBIR asking it to transfer to both
categories and sketch distributions. Our key contribution is a test-time
training paradigm that can adapt using just one sketch. Since there is no
paired photo, we make use of a sketch raster-vector reconstruction module as a
self-supervised auxiliary task. To maintain the fidelity of the trained
cross-modal joint embedding during test-time update, we design a novel
meta-learning based training paradigm to learn a separation between model
updates incurred by this auxiliary task from those off the primary objective of

giant stars of Pal 12 published in literature, re-analyzed by us using the same

increased interest in the research community due to its excellent research
value and broad real-world application. It is designed for the scenarios where
the queries are from one modality and the retrieval galleries from another
modality. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on the ITR
approaches from four perspectives. By dissecting an ITR system into two
processes: feature extraction and feature alignment, we summarize the recent
advance of the ITR approaches from these two perspectives. On top of this, the
efficiency-focused study on the ITR system is introduced as the third
perspective. To keep pace with the times, we also provide a pioneering overview
of the cross-modal pre-training ITR approaches as the fourth perspective.
Finally, we outline the common benchmark datasets and valuation metric for ITR,
and conduct the accuracy comparison among the representative ITR approaches.
Some critical yet less studied issues are discussed at the end of the paper.

Apart from
low-level representations such as meshes and voxels, researchers also seek to
semantically abstract complex objects with basic geometric primitives. Recent
deep learning methods rely heavily on datasets, with limited generality to
unseen categories. Furthermore, abstracting an object accurately yet with a
small number of primitives still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose
a novel non-parametric Bayesian statistical method to infer an abstraction,
consisting of an unknown number of geometric primitives, from a point cloud. We
model the generation of points as observations sampled from an infinite mixture
of Gaussian Superquadric Taper Models (GSTM). Our approach formulates the
abstraction as a clustering problem, in which: 1) each point is assigned to a
cluster via the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP); 2) a primitive representation
is optimized for each cluster, and 3) a merging post-process is incorporated to
provide a concise representation. We conduct extensive experiments on two
datasets. The results indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
in terms of accuracy and is generalizable to various types of objects.

principles beyond von-Neumann computing. Magnetic skyrmions, topological
particle-like spin textures in magnetic films are particularly promising for
implementing RC, since they respond strongly nonlinear to external stimuli and
feature inherent multiscale dynamics. However, despite several theoretical
proposals that exist for skyrmion reservoir computing, experimental
realizations have been elusive until now. Here, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a conceptually new approach to skyrmion RC that leverages the
thermally activated diffusive motion of skyrmions. By confining the
electrically gated and thermal skyrmion motion, we find that already a single
skyrmion in a confined geometry suffices to realize non-linearly separable
functions, which we demonstrate for the XOR gate along with all other Boolean
logic gate operations. Besides this universality, the reservoir computing
concept ensures low training costs and ultra-low power operation with current
densities orders of magnitude smaller than those used in existing spintronic
reservoir computing demonstrations. Our proposed concept can be readily
extended by linking multiple confined geometries and/or by including more
skyrmions in the reservoir, suggesting high potential for scalable and
low-energy reservoir computing.

universe typically use initial conditions with a fixed power spectrum and
random phases of the density field, leading to structure consistent with the
local distribution of galaxies only in a statistical sense. It is, however,
possible to infer the initial phases which lead to the configuration of
galaxies and clusters that we see around us. We analyse the CSiBORG suite of
101 simulations, formed by constraining the density field within 155 Mpc$/h$
with dark matter particle mass $4.38\times10^9 M_\odot$, to quantify the degree
to which constraints imposed on 2.65 Mpc$/h$ scales reduce variance in the halo
mass function and halo-halo cross-correlation function on a range of scales.
This is achieved by contrasting CSiBORG with a subset of the unconstrained
Quijote simulations and expectations for the $\Lambda$CDM average. Using the
FOF, PHEW and HOP halofinders, we show that the CSiBORG suite beats cosmic
variance at large mass scales ($\gtrsim 10^{14}M_{\odot}/h$), which are most
strongly constrained by the initial conditions, and exhibits a significant
halo-halo cross-correlation out to $\sim30$ Mpc$/h$. Moreover, the effect of
the constraints percolates down to lower mass objects and to scales below those
on which they are imposed. Finally, we develop an algorithm to ""twin"" halos
between realisations and show that approximately 50% of halos with mass greater
than $10^{15}M_{\odot}/h$ can be identified in all realisations of the CSiBORG

  Limited Data","Minor errors corrected, additional clarification added, results
  unchanged",,,,"math.AP q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pattern formation in biological tissues plays an important role in the
development of living organisms. Since the classical work of Alan Turing, a
pre-eminent way of modelling has been through reaction-diffusion mechanisms.
More recently, alternative models have been proposed, that link dynamics of
diffusing molecular signals with tissue mechanics. In order to distinguish
among different models, they should be compared to experimental observations.
However, in many experimental situations only the limiting, stationary regime
of the pattern formation process is observable, without knowledge of the
transient behaviour or the initial state. The unstable nature of the underlying
dynamics in all alternative models seriously complicates model and parameter
identification, since small changes in the initial condition lead to distinct
stationary patterns. To overcome this problem the initial state of the model
can be randomised. In the latter case, fixed values of the model parameters
correspond to a family of patterns rather than a fixed stationary solution, and
standard approaches to compare pattern data directly with model outputs, e.g.,
in the least squares sense, are not suitable. Instead, statistical
characteristics of the patterns should be compared, which is difficult given
the typically limited amount of available data in practical applications. To
deal with this problem, we extend a recently developed statistical approach for
parameter identification using pattern data, the so-called Correlation Integral
Likelihood (CIL) method. We suggest modifications that allow increasing the
accuracy of the identification process without resizing the data set. The
proposed approach is tested using different classes of pattern formation
models. For all considered equations, parallel GPU-based implementations of the
numerical solvers with efficient time stepping schemes are provided.

address this issue, multi-panel user equipment (MPUE) is adopted for FR2
whereby multiple antenna panels are placed on the UE body to leverage gains
from antenna directivity. In contrast to traditional UEs with isotropic
radiation patterns, signal measurements of cells in the network may not be

signal measurements that affect the reliability of mobility decisions. In this
paper, we investigate the mobility performance of two different MPUE schemes
following different paradigms for signal measurement and compare their
performance with traditional UEs. This performance evaluation is based in
multi-beam 5G networks operating in FR2 where there are multiple simultaneously
active beams per cell to realize the high throughput requirements. Furthermore,
an in-depth analysis of the mobility performance is carried out to determine
the best mobility parameter combinations for the different MPUE schemes.
Results have shown that both MPUE schemes offer considerable mobility

unique electronic, mechanical and thermal properties. In particular, they are
promising candidates for monochromatic, table-top X-ray sources. This work
reveals that the versatility of the table-top vdW X-ray source goes beyond what
has been demonstrated so far. By introducing a tilt angle between the vdW
structure and the incident electron beam, it is theoretically and
experimentally shown that the accessible photon energy range is more than
doubled. This allows for greater versatility in real-time tuning of the vdW
X-ray source. Furthermore, this work shows that the accessible photon energy
range is maximized by simultaneously controlling both the electron energy and
the vdW structure tilt. These results should pave the way for highly tunable,
compact X-ray sources, with potential applications including hyperspectral
X-ray fluoroscopy and X-ray quantum optics.

pollutant concentrations, are becoming increasingly prevalent in environmental
and public health research. However, low-cost air pollution data can be noisy,
biased by environmental conditions, and usually need to be field-calibrated by
collocating low-cost sensors with reference-grade instruments. We show,
theoretically and empirically, that the common procedure of regression-based
calibration using collocated data systematically underestimates high air
pollution concentrations, which are critical to diagnose from a health
perspective. Current calibration practices also often fail to utilize the
spatial correlation in pollutant concentrations. We propose a novel spatial
filtering approach to collocation-based calibration of low-cost networks that
mitigates the underestimation issue by using an inverse regression. The
inverse-regression also allows for incorporating spatial correlations by a
second-stage model for the true pollutant concentrations using a conditional
Gaussian Process. Our approach works with one or more collocated sites in the
network and is dynamic, leveraging spatial correlation with the latest
available reference data. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate how the
spatial filtering substantially improves estimation of pollutant
concentrations, and measures peak concentrations with greater accuracy. We
apply the methodology for calibration of a low-cost PM2.5 network in Baltimore,
Maryland, and diagnose air pollution peaks that are missed by the
regression-calibration.

noisy modalities. Most state-of-the-art methods for audio-visual (A-V) fusion
rely on recurrent networks or conventional attention mechanisms that do not
effectively leverage the complementary nature of A-V modalities. In this paper,
we focus on dimensional emotion recognition based on the fusion of facial and
vocal modalities extracted from videos. Specifically, we propose a joint
cross-attention model that relies on the complementary relationships to extract
the salient features across A-V modalities, allowing for accurate prediction of
continuous values of valence and arousal. The proposed fusion model efficiently
leverages the inter-modal relationships, while reducing the heterogeneity
between the features. In particular, it computes the cross-attention weights
based on correlation between the combined feature representation and individual
modalities. By deploying the combined A-V feature representation into the
cross-attention module, the performance of our fusion module improves
significantly over the vanilla cross-attention module. Experimental results on
validation-set videos from the AffWild2 dataset indicate that our proposed A-V
fusion model provides a cost-effective solution that can outperform

experimental datasets including the fluidic pinball, a swirling jet, and the
wake behind a couple of tandem cylinders. Analyzing the fluidic pinball, the
manifold is able to describe the pitchfork bifurcation and the chaotic regime
with only three feature coordinates. These coordinates are linked to
vortex-shedding phases and the force coefficients. The manifold coordinates of
the swirling jet are comparable to the POD mode amplitudes, yet allow for a
more distinct manifold identification which is less sensitive to measurement
noise. As similar observation is made for the wake of two tandem cylinders
(Raiola et al., 2016). The tandem cylinders are aligned in streamwise distance
which corresponds to the transition between the single bluff body and the
reattachment regimes of vortex shedding. Isomap unveils these two shedding
regimes while the Lissajous plots of first two POD mode amplitudes feature a
single circle. The reconstruction error of the manifold model is small compared
to the fluctuation level, indicating that the low embedding dimensions contains
the coherent structure dynamics. The proposed Isomap-KNN manifold learner is
expected to be of large importance in estimation, dynamic modeling and control

packing of soft, deformable balls. This is motivated by recent studies of
quasi-periodic equilibria arising from dense packings of diblock and star
polymers. Restricting to the planar case, we investigate the equilibrium
packings of identical, deformable objects whose shapes are determined by an
$N$-site Voronoi tessellation of a periodic rectangle. We derive a reduced
formulation of the system showing at equilibria each site must reside at the
``max-center'' of its associated Voronoi region and construct a family of
ordered ``single-string'' minimizers whose cardinality is $O(N^2)$. We identify
sharp conditions under which the system admits a regular hexagonal tessellation
and establish that in all cases the average energy per site is bounded below by
that of a regular hexagon of unit size. However, numerical investigation of
gradient flow of random initial data, reveals that for modest values of $N$ the
system preponderantly equilibrates to quasi-ordered states with low energy and
large basins of attraction. For larger $N$ the distribution of equilibria
energies appears to approach a $\delta$-function limit, whose energy is
significantly higher than the ground state hexagon. This limit is possibly
shaped by two mechanisms: a proliferation of moderate-energy disordered
equilibria that block access of the gradient flow to lower energy quasi-ordered
states and a rigid threshold on the maximum energy of stable states.

In the
local Universe, these sources are generally selected through the detection of
the HCN-vib (3-2) emission line at submillimetre wavelengths. In this work, we
present a diagnostic method to select deeply buried nuclei based on
mid-infrared (mid-IR) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and continuum
ratios. Using Spitzer/IRS spectra of a representative sample of local ULIRGs
(z<0.27), we examine their PAH and underlying continuum emission ratios. For
deeply embedded sources, we find that the 9.7 micron silicate absorption band
has a particularly pronounced effect on the 11.3 micron PAH feature. The low
flux level in the nuclear silicate absorption band enhances the 11.3 micron PAH
feature contrast (high PAH equivalent width) compared to that of the other PAH
features. The technique has been extended to include the use of the continuum
ratios. However, the latter are affected both by the extinction coming from the
host galaxy as well as the nuclear region, whereas the foreground extinction is
cancelled out when using the PAH equivalent width ratios. We apply our method
to the HERUS and GOALS samples and classify as CON candidates 14 ULIRGs and 10
LIRGs, corresponding to 30% of ULIRGs and 7% of LIRGs from these samples. We
find that the observed continuum ratios of CON-dominated sources can be
explained by assuming torus models with a tapered disk geometry and a smooth
dust distribution. This suggests that the nuclear dusty structure of CONs has
an extremely high dust coverage. We also demonstrate that the use of mid-IR
color-color diagrams is an effective way to select CON-dominated sources at
different redshifts. In particular, the combination of filters of the JWST/MIRI
will enable the selection of CONs out to z~1.5. This will allow extending the
selection of CONs to high redshifts where U/LIRGs are more numerous.

data indicated that the addition of Cd2+ ions induces the compaction of the

threshold level inducing the switch from non-wetting to partial wetting state,
[Cd2+] = 0.25 mM, was determined by microinterferometry. The interactions
between vesicles and brushes were evaluated by height fluctuations of the
membrane in contact with brushes and the shape of vesicles near the surface. To
analyze these experiments, we have studied adhesion of axially symmetric
vesicles for finite-range membrane-substrate interaction and buoyancy through
simulations. We found that the local transversality condition that relates the
maximal curvature at the edge of the adhesion zone to the adhesion strength
remains rather accurate. Thus, although it is not experimentally possible to
prepare vesicles at zero buoyancy, we can use the transversality condition to
estimate the adhesion strength. However, the adhesion diagram is significantly
modified by a finite range of membrane-substrate interaction and buoyancy. For
downward buoyancy, vesicles merely sediment onto the substrate and there is no
mean-field adhesion transition. For upward buoyancy, adhered vesicles are
metastable at best. Thus, a mean-field adhesion transition can only occur at
vanishing buoyancy. Only for zero-range membrane-substrate interaction does a
second-order adhesion transition occur at finite interaction strength. For any
finite-range interaction, the transition occurs when the membrane-substrate
interaction changes from repulsive to attractive. We present a adhesion diagram
as a function of adhesion strength and buoyancy and compare the adhesion
behavior of vesicles to the wetting behavior of droplets of liquids.

  We next consider the semi-streaming regime, where computing even the exact

offer unique advantages for several quantum information applications. However,
a given quantum information application for its optimal performance requires
generation of a specific OAM entangled state with full control over the shape
of the OAM Schmidt spectrum. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is
the most widely used method for generating OAM entangled states. Most of the
existing methods for controlling the generation of the state employ
postselection, which invariably compromises the security benefits of quantum
information applications. The postselection-free generation of OAM entangled
states can be achieved either by adjusting the SPDC phase matching condition or
by shaping the profile of the pump field used for down-conversion. While it is
known that the phase matching adjustments can only change the width of the OAM
Schmidt spectrum, even the most recent works based on pump shaping have
demonstrated generation of only up to 24-dimensional states with very limited
control over the OAM Schmidt spectrum. Here, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a technique that employs both the phase matching adjustments and
pump-shaping for generating high-dimensional OAM entangled states with complete
control over the shape of the OAM Schmidt spectrum. We report generation of up
to 200-dimensional OAM entangled states with three different spectra, namely,
Gaussian, rectangular and triangular, with up to 99% generation accuracy.

  oscillatory flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many complications in physiology are associated with a deviation in flow in
arteries due to a stenosis. The presence of stenosis may transition the flow to
weak turbulence. The degree of stenosis as well as its configuration whether
symmetric or non-symmetric to the parent artery influences whether the flow
would stay laminar or transition to turbulence. Plenty of research efforts
focus on investigating the role of varying degrees of stenosis in the onset of
turbulence under steady and pulsatile flow conditions. None of the studies,
however, have focused on investigating this under oscillatory flow conditions
as flow reversal is a major occurrence in a number of physiologic flows, and is
of particular relevance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow research. Following
up on the previous work in which a 75% stenosis was studied, this contribution
is a detailed investigation of the role of degrees of stenosis on transition in
an oscillatory flow. A cylindrical pipe with 25%, 50% and 60% reductions in
area in axisymmetric and eccentric configurations is studied for transition
with 3 different pulsation frequencies of a purely oscillatory flow. Cycle
averaged Reynolds numbers between 1800 and 2100 in steps of 100 are studied for
each configuration resulting in 72 simulations each conducted on 76800 CPU
cores of a modern supercomputer. It is found that a higher degree of stenosis
and eccentricity causes earlier transition to turbulence in oscillatory flow.
The results further demonstrate that a higher frequency of oscillation results
in larger hydrodynamic instability in the flow, which is more prominent in
smaller degrees of stenosis.

decoupling of storage results in further challenges for highly distributed edge
environments.
  To address this, we propose SyncMesh, a system to manage, query, and
transform data in a scalable and stateless manner by leveraging the
capabilities of Function-as-a-Service and at the same time enabling data
locality. Furthermore, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it
against established centralized and decentralized systems in regard to traffic
usage and request times.
  The preliminary results indicate that SyncMesh is able to exonerate the
network layer and accelerate the transmission of data to clients, while
simultaneously improving local data processing.

by some external events (e.g., COVID-19 caused increasing purchase of the face

for a complete DFA. The hypothesis was formulated in 1966 by Starke. The
problem has motivated great and constantly growing number of investigations and
generalizations. We present the proof of the \v{C}erny-Starke conjecture: the
deterministic complete n-state synchronizing automaton has synchronizing word
of length at most (n-1)(n-1). The proof used connection between dimension of
the space and the length of words on paths of edges in underlying graph of
automaton.

field of communications and sensing. Its ultrahigh efficiency is
unprecedentedly desired in the current green and data era. However,
dramatically increasing the modulation efficiency is difficult due to the
monotonic mapping relationship between the electrical signal and modulated
optical signal. Here, a new mechanism termed phase-transition EO modulation is
revealed from the reciprocal transition between two distinct phase planes
arising from the bifurcation. Remarkably, a monolithically integrated
mode-locked laser (MLL) is implemented as a prototype. A 24.8-GHz
radio-frequency signal is generated and modulated, achieving a modulation
energy efficiency of 3.06 fJ/bit improved by about four orders of magnitude and
a contrast ratio exceeding 50 dB. Thus, MLL-based phase-transition EO
modulation is characterised by ultrahigh modulation efficiency and ultrahigh
contrast ratio, as experimentally proved in radio-over-fibre and underwater
acoustic-sensing systems. This phase-transition EO modulation opens a new
avenue for green communication and ubiquitous connections.

computational photography. Significant progress has been made with multi-frame
HDR reconstruction methods, producing high-resolution, rich and accurate color
reconstructions with high-frequency details. However, they are still prone to
fail in dynamic or largely over-exposed scenes, where frame misalignment often
results in visible ghosting artifacts. Recent approaches attempt to alleviate
this by utilizing an event-based camera (EBC), which measures only binary
changes of illuminations. Despite their desirable high temporal resolution and
dynamic range characteristics, such approaches have not outperformed
traditional multi-frame reconstruction methods, mainly due to the lack of color
information and low-resolution sensors. In this paper, we propose to leverage
both bracketed LDR images and simultaneously captured events to obtain the best
of both worlds: high-quality RGB information from bracketed LDRs and
complementary high frequency and dynamic range information from events. We
present a multi-modal end-to-end learning-based HDR imaging system that fuses
bracketed images and event modalities in the feature domain using attention and
multi-scale spatial alignment modules. We propose a novel event-to-image
feature distillation module that learns to translate event features into the
image-feature space with self-supervision. Our framework exploits the higher
temporal resolution of events by sub-sampling the input event streams using a
sliding window, enriching our combined feature representation. Our proposed
approach surpasses SoTA multi-frame HDR reconstruction methods using synthetic
and real events, with a 2dB and 1dB improvement in PSNR-L and PSNR-mu on the
HdM HDR dataset, respectively.

events, involving 460 positive individuals, as identified in early 2021 by
routine surveillance and through an extensive screening conducted on students,
school personnel, and their household members during an outbreak in a small
municipality of Italy. Results From the analysis of potential transmission
chains, we estimated that, on average, 55.1%, 17.3% and 27.6% infection
episodes were linked to household, school, and community contacts,
respectively. Clusters originated from students or school personnel showed a
larger average cluster size (3.32 vs 1.15), a larger average number of
generations in the transmission chain (1.56 vs 1.17) and a larger set of
associated close contacts (11.3 vs 3.15, on average). We found substantial
transmission heterogeneities, with 20% positive individuals seeding 75-80 of
all transmission. A higher proportion of infected individuals causing onward
transmission was found among students (48.8% vs 29.9%, on average), who also
caused a markedly higher number of secondary cases (mean: 1.3 vs 0.5).
Conclusions Uncontrolled transmission at school could disrupt the regular
conduct of teaching activities, likely seeding the transmission into other
settings, and increasing the burden on contact-tracing operations.

the difference is even smaller: 0.715 vs. 0.722. Meanwhile, the resulting
learnable process-based models can output a full set of untrained variables,
e.g., soil and groundwater storage, snowpack, evapotranspiration, and baseflow,
and later be constrained by their observations. Both simulated
evapotranspiration and fraction of discharge from baseflow agreed decently with
alternative estimates. The general framework can work with models with various

of Meta Functional Learning (MFL) by meta-learning a generalisable functional
model from data-rich tasks whilst simultaneously regularising knowledge
transfer to data-scarce tasks. The MFL computes meta-knowledge on functional
regularisation generalisable to different learning tasks by which functional
training on limited labelled data promotes more discriminative functions to be
learned. Based on this framework, we formulate three variants of MFL: MFL with
Prototypes (MFL-P) which learns a functional by auxiliary prototypes, Composite
MFL (ComMFL) that transfers knowledge from both functional space and
representational space, and MFL with Iterative Updates (MFL-IU) which improves
knowledge transfer regularisation from MFL by progressively learning the
functional regularisation in knowledge transfer. Moreover, we generalise these
variants for knowledge transfer regularisation from binary classifiers to
multi-class classifiers. Extensive experiments on two few-shot learning
scenarios, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL),
show that meta functional learning for knowledge transfer regularisation can

$P_2$ are antimagic. Denote the disjoint union of graphs $G$ and $H$ by $G \cup
H$, and the disjoint union of $t$ copies of $G$ by $tG$. For an antimagic graph
$G$ (connected or disconnected), we define the parameter $\tau(G)$ to be the
maximum integer such that $G \cup tP_3$ is antimagic for all $t \leq \tau(G)$.
Chang, Chen, Li, and Pan showed that for all antimagic graphs $G$, $\tau(G)$ is
finite [Graphs and Combinatorics 37 (2021), 1065--1182]. Further, Shang, Lin,
Liaw [Util. Math. 97 (2015), 373--385] and Li [Master Thesis, National Chung
Hsing University, Taiwan, 2019] found the exact value of $\tau(G)$ for special
families of graphs: star forests and balanced double stars respectively. They
did this by finding explicit antimagic labelings of $G\cup tP_3$ and proving a
tight upper bound on $\tau(G)$ for these special families. In the present
paper, we generalize their results by proving an upper bound on $\tau(G)$ for
all graphs. For star forests and balanced double stars, this general bound is
equivalent to the bounds given in \cite{star forest} and \cite{double star} and
tight. In addition, we prove that the general bound is also tight for every
other graph we have studied, including an infinite family of jellyfish graphs,
cycles $C_n$ where $3 \leq n \leq 9$, and the double triangle $2C_3$.

advocating the use of sketches as a new modality for class support. The product
is a ""Doodle It Yourself"" (DIY) FSCIL framework where the users can freely
sketch a few examples of a novel class for the model to learn to recognize

Traditional trace-based cache simulators precisely account for sophisticated
real-world cache models and support arbitrary workloads, but their runtime is
proportional to the number of memory accesses performed by the program under

polyhedral model, analytical approaches often achieve problem-size-independent

  We introduce a hybrid approach, warping cache simulation, that aims to
achieve applicability to real-world cache models and problem-size-independent

polyhedral model, which allows to reason about the sequence of memory accesses

fast-forward the simulation. By this process of warping, we accelerate the
simulation so that its cost is often independent of the number of memory

has shown tremendous success at finding universal phenomenology. However,
further progress is often burdened by the difficulty of determining the forces
that control the dynamics of the individual elements within each system.
Accessing this local information is key to understanding the physics dominating
the system and to create the models that can explain the observed collective
phenomena. In this work, we present a machine-learning model, a graph neural
network, that uses the collective movement of the system to learn the active
and two-body forces controlling the individual dynamics of the particles. We
verify our approach using numerical simulations of active brownian particles,
considering different interaction potentials and levels of activity. Finally,
we apply our model to experiments of electrophoretic Janus particles,
extracting the active and two-body forces that control the dynamics of the
colloids. Due to this, we can uncover the physics dominating the behavior of
the system. We extract an active force that depends on the electric field and
also area fraction. We also discover a dependence of the two-body interaction
with the electric field that leads us to propose that the dominant force
between these colloids is a screened electrostatic interaction with a constant
length scale. We expect that this methodology can open a new avenue for the
study and modeling of experimental systems of active particles.

the governing equations, we investigate the transverse linear instability of
these periodic waves and the induced dimension-breaking bifurcation. The two

linearization at a periodic wave. We apply a simple general criterion for the
transverse linear instability problem and a Lyapunov center theorem for the
dimension-breaking bifurcation. For parameters $(\alpha,\beta)$ in the open set

executed on the blockchain. Vulnerabilities in their implementation have led to
severe loss of cryptocurrency. Smart contracts become immutable when deployed
to the Ethereum blockchain. Therefore, it is essential to understand the nature
of vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts to prevent them in the future.
Existing classifications exist, but are limited in several ways. Objective: We
aim to characterize vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts written in
Solidity, and unify existing classifications schemes. Method: We extracted 2143
vulnerabilities from public coding platforms and popular vulnerability
databases and categorized them using a card sorting approach. We targeted the
Ethereum blockchain in this paper, as it is the first and most popular
blockchain to support the deployment of smart contracts, and Solidity as the
most widely used language to implement smart contracts. We devised a
classification scheme of smart contract vulnerabilities according to their
error source and impact. Afterwards, we mapped existing classification schemes
to our classification. Results: The resulting classification consists of 11
categories describing the error source of a vulnerability and 13 categories
describing potential impacts. Our findings show that the language specific
coding and the structural data flow categories are the dominant categories, but
that the frequency of occurrence differs substantially between the data
sources. Conclusions: Our findings enable researchers to better understand
smart contract vulnerabilities by defining various dimensions of the problem
and supporting our classification with mappings with literature-based
classifications and frequency distributions of the defined categories.

Sketches are collections of rules of the form C -> E over a given set of

Sketches can encode simple goal serializations, general policies, or
decompositions of bounded width that can be solved greedily, in polynomial
time, by the SIW_R variant of the SIW algorithm. Previous work has shown the
computational value of sketches over benchmark domains that, while tractable,

positive is essential for both physical considerations and numerical stability.
This is a challenge, due to the underlying relation between such
positivity-preserving (PP) property and the magnetic divergence-free (DF)
constraint as well as the strong nonlinearity of the MHD equations. This paper
presents the first rigorous PP analysis of the central discontinuous Galerkin
(CDG) methods and constructs arbitrarily high-order PP CDG schemes for ideal
MHD. By the recently developed geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach, our
analysis reveals that the PP property of standard CDG methods is closely
related to a discrete DF condition, whose form was unknown and differs from the
non-central DG and finite volume cases in [K. Wu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2018].
This result lays the foundation for the design of our PP CDG schemes. In 1D
case, the discrete DF condition is naturally satisfied, and we prove the
standard CDG method is PP under a condition that can be enforced with a PP
limiter. However, in the multidimensional cases, the discrete DF condition is
highly nontrivial yet critical, and we prove the the standard CDG method, even
with the PP limiter, is not PP in general, as it fails to meet the discrete DF
condition. We address this issue by carefully analyzing the structure of the
discrete divergence and then constructing new locally DF CDG schemes for
Godunov's modified MHD equations with an additional source. The key point is to
find out the suitable discretization of the source term such that it exactly
offsets all the terms in the discrete DF condition. Based on the GQL approach,
we prove the PP property of the new multidimensional CDG schemes. The
robustness and accuracy of PP CDG schemes are validated by several demanding
examples, including the high-speed jets and blast problems with very low plasma
beta.

propose a novel width-depth synchronous extension-based basis pursuit (WSEBP)
algorithm which solves the ML-CSC problem without the limitation of the number
of iterations compared to the SOTA algorithms and maximizes the performance by
an effective initialization in each layer. Then, we propose a simple and

ML-CSC-based feature encoder and a fully-connected layer to validate the
performance of WSEBP on image classification task. The experimental results
show that our proposed WSEBP outperforms SOTA algorithms in terms of accuracy
and consumption resources. In addition, the WSEBP integrated in CNNs can
improve the performance of deeper CNNs and make them interpretable. Finally,

inability to benchmark (e.g., due to selective participation into the trial) or
a failure of the emulation (e.g., due to unmeasured confounding), but we cannot

several different phases are realized, such as the familiar Bose-glass (BG),
Mott insulator (MI), superfluid (SF) phases, and, additionally, we observe a
mixed phase, specific to the QP disorder, which we call as a QM phase.
Incidentally, the QP disorder stabilizes the BG phase more efficiently than the
case of random disorder. Further, we have employed a finite-size scaling
analysis to characterize various phase transitions via computing the critical
transition points and the corresponding critical exponents. The results show
that for both types of disorder, the transition from the BG phase to the SF
phase belongs to the same universality class. However, the QM to the SF
transition for the QP disorder comprises of different critical exponents,
thereby hinting at the involvement of a different universality class therein.
The critical exponents that depict all the various phase transitions occurring

and 2.3-fold higher vs. control at 3 h, and the efferent VNS normalized glucose
levels. Complete withdrawal of vagal innervation results in a 72h delayed onset
of sustained increase in glucose levels for at least 54h and intermittent
hyperinsulinemia. Under conditions of moderate fetal inflammation, this is
related to higher levels of gut inflammation; the efferent VNS reduces the
systemic inflammatory response as well as restores both the levels of glucose
and terminal ileum inflammation, but not the insulin levels. Our findings
reveal a novel regulatory, hormetic, role of the vagus nerve in the
immunometabolic response to endotoxin in near-term fetuses.

artificial non-absorbing barriers makes the LA schemes resilient to being
trapped in absorbing barriers, a phenomenon which is often referred to as lock
in probability leading to an exclusive choice of one action after convergence.
Within the field of LA and reinforcement learning in general, there is a
sacristy of theoretical works and applications of schemes with artificial
barriers. In this paper, we devise a LA with artificial barriers for solving a
general form of stochastic bimatrix game. Classical LA systems possess
properties of absorbing barriers and they are a powerful tool in game theory
and were shown to converge to game's of Nash equilibrium under limited
information. However, the stream of works in LA for solving game theoretical
problems can merely solve the case where the Saddle Point of the game exists in
a pure strategy and fail to reach mixed Nash equilibrium when no Saddle Point
exists for a pure strategy. In this paper, by resorting to the powerful concept
of artificial barriers, we suggest a LA that converges to an optimal mixed Nash
equilibrium even though there may be no Saddle Point when a pure strategy is
invoked. Our deployed scheme is of Linear Reward-Inaction ($L_{R-I}$) flavor
which is originally an absorbing LA scheme, however, we render it non-absorbing
by introducing artificial barriers in an elegant and natural manner, in the
sense that that the well-known legacy $L_{R-I}$ scheme can be seen as an
instance of our proposed algorithm for a particular choice of the barrier.
Furthermore, we present an $S$ Learning version of our LA with absorbing
barriers that is able to handle $S$-Learning environment in which the feedback
is continuous and not binary as in the case of the $L_{R-I}$.

communications for DRL-based platoon controllers is studied with an emphasis on
the tradeoff between the gain of including exogenous information in the system
state for reducing uncertainty and the performance erosion due to the

the most appropriate state space. SSDP models are conceived for platoon control
under different information topologies (IFT) by taking into account `just

requirements of their embedding tables. These embedding tables can often reach
hundreds of gigabytes which increases hardware requirements and training cost.
A common technique to reduce model size is to hash all of the categorical
variable identifiers (ids) into a smaller space. This hashing reduces the
number of unique representations that must be stored in the embedding table;
thus decreasing its size. However, this approach introduces collisions between
semantically dissimilar ids that degrade model quality. We introduce an
alternative approach, Learned Hash Functions, which instead learns a new
mapping function that encourages collisions between semantically similar ids.
We derive this learned mapping from historical data and embedding access
patterns. We experiment with this technique on a production model and find that
a mapping informed by the combination of access frequency and a learned low
dimension embedding is the most effective. We demonstrate a small improvement
relative to the hashing trick and other collision related compression

(sEMG) signals has recently shown significant potential for development of
advanced myoelectric-controlled prosthesis. Existing deep learning approaches,
typically, include only one model as such can hardly maintain acceptable
generalization performance in changing scenarios. In this paper, we aim to
address this challenge by capitalizing on the recent advances of hybrid models
and transformers. In other words, we propose a hybrid framework based on the
transformer architecture, which is a relatively new and revolutionizing deep
learning model. The proposed hybrid architecture, referred to as the
Transformer for Hand Gesture Recognition (TraHGR), consists of two parallel
paths followed by a linear layer that acts as a fusion center to integrate the
advantage of each module and provide robustness over different scenarios. We
evaluated the proposed architecture TraHGR based on the commonly used second
Ninapro dataset, referred to as the DB2. The sEMG signals in the DB2 dataset
are measured in the real-life conditions from 40 healthy users, each performing
49 gestures. We have conducted extensive set of experiments to test and
validate the proposed TraHGR architecture, and have compared its achievable
accuracy with more than five recently proposed HGR classification algorithms
over the same dataset. We have also compared the results of the proposed TraHGR
architecture with each individual path and demonstrated the distinguishing
power of the proposed hybrid architecture. The recognition accuracies of the
proposed TraHGR architecture are 86.18%, 88.91%, 81.44%, and 93.84%, which are
2.48%, 5.12%, 8.82%, and 4.30% higher than the state-ofthe-art performance for
DB2 (49 gestures), DB2-B (17 gestures), DB2-C (23 gestures), and DB2-D (9
gestures), respectively.

enrolled with one stylus and then, later on, they produce some testing samples
using a different stylus model with different pressure response. Experimental
results show: 1) a saturation behavior in pressure signal 2) different dynamic
ranges in the different stylus studied 3) improved biometric recognition
accuracy by means of pressure signal normalization as well as a performance
degradation in mismatched conditions 4) interoperability between different

produces an improvement in signature identification rates higher than 7%

to their low profile and advantageous applications. Practically, many
metasurface designs start with a set of constraints for the radiated far-field,
such as main-beam direction(s) and side lobe levels, and end with a non-uniform
physical structure for the surface. This problem is quite challenging, since
the required tangential field transformations are not completely known when
only constraints are placed on the scattered fields. Hence, the required
surface properties cannot be solved for analytically. Moreover, the translation
of the desired surface properties to the physical unit cells can be
time-consuming and difficult, as it is often a one-to-many mapping in a large
solution space. Here, we divide the inverse design process into two steps: a
macroscopic and microscopic design step. In the former, we use an iterative
optimization process to find the surface properties that radiate a far-field
pattern that complies with specified constraints. This iterative process
exploits non-radiating currents to ensure a passive and lossless design. In the
microscopic step, these optimized surface properties are realized with physical
unit cells using machine learning surrogate models. The effectiveness of this
end-to-end synthesis process is demonstrated through measurement results of a
beam-splitting prototype.

One with a clean inlet and the other with an inlet disturbance given by white
Gaussian noise superimposed on the inlet velocity. For the clean inlet case,
the flow remains laminar on the entire blade surface for both the test cases.
It undergoes transition on the suction side for the inlet disturbance case. The
pressure coefficient for the T106A and the isentropic Mach number on the blade
surface for the T106C matches well with the experimental results. Also, the
qualitative comparison of flow features in terms of the Q-criterion is in good
