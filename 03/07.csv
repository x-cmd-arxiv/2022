  L-functions","30 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.NT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We provide efficient methods to evaluate the Riemann zeta, the Lerch zeta and
the Dirichlet $L$-functions. The method uses the Riemann-Siegel (RS) type
formulas and a modified double exponential (MDE) quadrature method near the
saddle point of appropriate integrands. We provide simplified derivations of
the RS formulas, containing finite series sums and residual integrals, for the
Lerch and the Dirichlet $L$-functions. The MDE method allows us to remove the
contribution of the singularities near the contour of integration for the
residual integrals. The method allows us to evaluate the residual integrals to
any prescribed accuracy. The numerical cost of evaluating them is minimal
compared to the main series sums. Thus even highly oscillatory integrands for
these functions can be evaluated with the same complexity as the RS formula. In
particular, the numerical complexity to evaluate the $\zeta(s)$ and the Lerch
zeta function with $s=\sigma+i t$ scales as $\sqrt{t}$, and for Dirichlet
$L$-function it scales as $\max(q, \sqrt{q t})$. The method allows the
automatic setting of integral cutoffs and finite discretization size to achieve
prescribed accuracy. Furthermore, it ensures that every halving of the
discretization interval almost leads to doubling the accuracy of the results.
Thus, it allows for a further check on the accuracy of the results obtained.

power-law size distribution index $3.2 \pm 0.2$, was impulsively produced

endorse the notion that above a critical mass stars fail to produce supernova

suppressing star formation feedback for some 5--10 million years, in practice
leading to runaway star formation, analog to {\it overcooling} that in absence
of feedback would have turned most baryons into stars in the early Universe.
Under such conditions, multiple episodes of stars formation, incorporating
binary star ejecta from previous episodes, appear to be unavoidable, thus
accounting for the ubiquity of the multiple population phenomenon in globular

throughput in future communication systems is compatible with various
communication techniques such as non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA). In this
paper, the downlink transmission of IRS-assisted NOMA communication is
considered while undergoing imperfect channel state information (CSI).
Consequently, a robust IRS-aided NOMA design is proposed by solving the
sum-rate maximization problem to jointly find the optimal beamforming vectors
for the access point and the passive reflection matrix for the IRS, using the
penalty dual decomposition (PDD) scheme. This problem can be solved through an
iterative algorithm, with closed-form solutions in each step, and it is shown
to have very close performance to its upper bound obtained from perfect CSI
scenario. We also present a trellis-based method for optimal discrete phase
shift selection of IRS which is shown to outperform the conventional
quantization method. Our results show that the proposed algorithms, for both
continuous and discrete IRS, have very low computational complexity compared to
other schemes in the literature. Furthermore, we conduct a performance
comparison from achievable sum-rate standpoint between IRS-aided NOMA and
IRS-aided orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which demonstrates superiority of
NOMA compared to OMA in case of a tolerated channel uncertainty.

set in a two-dimensional strip-like geometry, with periodic boundary conditions
respect to the horizontal direction $x_1\in\mathbb{T}$. We prove that the
system is locally null-controllable in any positive time, by means of a control
supported within an arbitrary open and non-empty subset. We proceed by a linear
test and duality, but quickly find that the linearized system is not symmetric
and the adjoint has a dynamic coupling between the two states through the
(fixed) boundary. Hence, motivated by a Fourier decomposition with respect to
$x_1$, we consider a family of one-dimensional systems and prove observability
results which are uniform with respect to the Fourier frequency parameter. The
latter results are also novel, as we compute the full spectrum of the
underlying operator for the non-zero Fourier modes. The zeroth mode system, on
the other hand, is seen as a controllability problem for the linear heat
equation with a finite-dimensional constraint. The complete observability of
the adjoint is derived by using a Lebeau-Robbiano strategy, and the local
controllability of the nonlinear system is then shown by combining an
adaptation of the source term method introduced in \cite{tucsnak_burgers} and a
Banach fixed point argument. Numerical experiments motivate several challenging
open problems, foraying even beyond the specific setting we deal with herein.

approximates the law of a particular diffusion bridge process $\{X_t\}_{t\in

suffer from the time discretization bias or the bias related with the

effectively leveraging the audio modality in vision-specific annotated videos

propose a novel audio-visual framework that effectively leverages the audio

models (e.g., BERT) to build a semantic audio-video label dictionary (SAVLD)
that maps each video label to its most K-relevant audio labels in which SAVLD
serves as a bridge between audio and video datasets. Then, SAVLD along with a

irrelevant audio modality and fuse only the relevant modalities. Moreover, we
present a new two-stream video Transformer for efficiently modeling the visual

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.105.034211",,"nlin.AO","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Frequency plays a crucial role in exhibiting various collective dynamics in
the coexisting co- and counter-rotating (CR) systems. To illustrate the impact
of CR frequencies, we consider a network of non-identical and globally coupled
Stuart-Landau oscillators with additional perturbation. Primarily, we
investigate the dynamical transitions in the absence of perturbation,
demonstrating that the transition from desynchronized state to cluster
oscillatory state occurs through an interesting partial synchronization state.
Followed by this, the system dynamics transits to amplitude death and
oscillation death states. Importantly, we find that the observed dynamical
states do not preserve the parity(P) symmetry in the absence of perturbation.
When the perturbation is increased one can note that the system dynamics
exhibits a new kind of transition which corresponds to a change from incoherent
mixed synchronization to coherent mixed synchronization through chimera state.
In particular, incoherent mixed synchronization and coherent mixed
synchronization states completely preserve the P-symmetry, whereas the chimera
state preserves the P-symmetry only partially. To demonstrate the occurrence of
such partial symmetry breaking (chimera) state, we use basin stability analysis
and discover that PSB exists as a result of the coexistence of symmetry
preserving and symmetry breaking behavior in the initial state space. Further,
a measure of the strength of P-symmetry is established to quantify the
P-symmetry in the observed dynamical states. Finally, by increasing the network
size, the robustness of the chimera is also inspected and we find that the
chimera state is robust even in networks of larger sizes. We also show the
generality of the above results in the related phase reduced model as well as
in other coupled models such as the globally coupled van der Pol and R\""ossler

galaxy clusters is the reacceleration of cosmic-ray electrons by turbulences.
However, the origin of the seed electrons for the reacceleration is still
poorly constrained. In the secondary scenario, most of the seed electrons are
injected via collision of proton cosmic-rays, while non-thermal electrons are
directly injected in the primary scenario. In this paper, we examine the two
scenarios for the seed electrons with the observed statistical properties of
RHs, combining two methods: following the temporal evolutions of the electron
energy and radial distributions in a cluster, and the merger history of
clusters. We find that the RH lifetime largely depends on the seed origin, as
it could be longer than the cosmological timescale in the secondary scenario.
We study the condition for the onset of RHs with the observed RH fraction and
the RH lifetime we obtained, and find that long-lived RHs in the secondary
scenario should be originated from major mergers with a mass ratio of
$\xi\sim0.1$, while the short lifetime in the primary scenario requires more
frequent onsets by minor mergers with $\xi\sim0.01$. Our simple model of the
turbulence acceleration can reproduce the observed radio luminosity-mass
relation. The RH luminosity functions we obtained suggest that the expected RH
number count with the ASKAP survey will detect $\approx10^3$ RHs in both the
scenarios.

which extends up to the temperature 150 K. The temperature dependence gets
stronger in alloys with lower $x$; $R_H\left(0\right)$ diverges at $x_c$

coefficient data for alloys with high Ti content to test the theories of
quantum corrections to conductivity. We found that the correction due to weak
localization is dominated by the electron-phonon scattering with the rate
varying with temperature as $\tau_{ep}^{-1}=A_{ep}T^2$. The extracted parameter
$A_{ep}$ is in good agreement with the theory that considers the incomplete

hydrodynamical simulations and the dust is treated in the pressureless-fluid
approximation, assuming a single grain size of $5\,\mu{\mathrm{m}}$. The
initial surface density profiles containing two bumps are motivated by recent
observations of the protoplanetary disc HD163296. When planets are allowed to
migrate, either a single planet from the outer pressure maximum or two planets
from each pressure maximum, the initial pressure bumps quickly spread and merge
into a single bump which is radially wide and has a very low amplitude. The
redistribution of the disc material is accompanied by the Rossby Wave
Instability (RWI) and an appearance of mini-vortices that merge in a short
period of time to form a large vortex. The large vortex induces perturbations
with a spiral wave pattern that propagate away from the vortex as density
waves. We found that these vortex-induced spiral waves strongly interact with
the spiral waves generated by the planet and we called this mechanism the
""\textit{Faraway Interaction}"". It facilitates much slower and/or stagnant
migration of the planets and it excites their orbital eccentricities in some
cases. Our study provides a new explanation for how rocky planets can come to
have a slow migration in protoplanetary discs where vortex formation occurs.

energy injection to the ejecta is possible. In this first paper of a series, we
study the dynamical evolution of the engine-fed kilonova (mergernova) ejecta in
detail. We perform a semi-analytical study of the problem by adopting a
modified mechanical blastwave model that invokes interaction between a
Poynting-flux-dominated flow and a non-magnetized massive ejecta. Shortly after
the engine is turned on, a pair of shocks would be excited. The reverse shock
quickly reaches the wind-acceleration region and disappears (in a few seconds),
whereas the forward shock soon breaks out from the ejecta (in $10^2$ - $10^3$
seconds) and continues to propagate in the surrounding interstellar medium.
Most of the energy injected into the blastwave from the engine is stored as
magnetic energy and kinetic energy. The internal energy fraction is $f_{\rm
int} < 0.3$ for an ejecta mass equal to $10^{-3}M_{\odot}$. Overall, the energy
injecting efficiency $\xi$ is at most $\sim 0.6$ and can be as small as $\sim
0.04$ at later times. Contrary to the previous assumption, efficient heating
only happens before the forward shock breaks out of the ejecta with a heating
efficiency $\xi_t \sim (0.006 - 0.3)$, which rapidly drops to $\sim 0$
afterwards. The engine-fed kilonova lightcurves will be carefully studied in

spectra that represent topological $K$-theory. The spectral multiplicative
structure introduces a new graded commutative ring structure on the $K$-groups,
generalizing the well-known graded ring structure of commutative
$C^*$-algebras. This last structure reflects the multiplicative structure of
topological $K$-theory via Gelfand duality, Swan's theorem and the fiber tensor
product.
  We introduce $\mathscr L$-permutative categories, a generalization of
bipermutative categories, which are permutative categories equipped with a
multiplicative structures induced by coherent actions of the linear isometries
operad. The main class of examples of interest are categories whose objects are
projection matrices of the unitization of the stabilizations
$\widetilde{\mathfrak{KA}}$ of a $C^*$-algebras $\mathfrak A$, and morphisms
partial isometries witnessing the Murray-von Neumann relation.
  We then construct $E_\infty$-ring spaces out of them by adapting the usual
method applied to bipermutative categories. The delooping functor of the
recognition principle, the homotopical augmentation ideal and localization at
the Bott element then give us our algebra spectra.

the context of Hoare triples are the appropriate notion for verifying access
control. It aims at obtaining human-readable descriptions of weakest
preconditions in order to close the validation gap between user requirements
and formal specification of smart contracts.
  As examples for the proposed approach, the paper focuses on two standard
SCRIPT programs that govern the distribution of Bitcoins, Pay to Public Key
Hash (P2PKH) and Pay to Multisig (P2MS). The paper introduces an operational
semantics of the SCRIPT commands used in P2PKH and P2MS, which is formalised in
the Agda proof assistant and reasoned about using Hoare triples. Two
methodologies for obtaining human-readable descriptions of weakest
preconditions are discussed:
  (1) a step-by-step approach, which works backwards instruction by instruction
through a script, sometimes grouping several instructions together;
  (2) symbolic execution of the code and translation into a nested case
distinction, which allows to read off weakest preconditions as the disjunction
of conjunctions of conditions along accepting paths.
  A syntax for equational reasoning with Hoare Triples is defined in order to
formalise those approaches in Agda.

failures, is a fundamental primitive for constructing reliable distributed
systems. The Paxos algorithm is synonymous with consensus and widely utilized
in production. Paxos uses two phases: phase one and phase two, each requiring a
quorum of acceptors, to reach consensus during a round of the protocol.
Traditionally, Paxos requires that all quorums, regardless of phase or round,
intersect and majorities are often used for this purpose. Flexible Paxos proved
that it is only necessary for phase one quorum of a given round to intersect
with the phase two quorums of all previous rounds.
  In this paper, we re-examine how Paxos approaches the problem of consensus.
We look again at quorum intersection in Flexible Paxos and observe that quorum
intersection can be safely weakened further. Most notably, we observe that if a
proposer learns that a value was proposed in some previous round then its phase
one no longer needs to intersect with the phase two quorums from that round or
from any previous rounds. Furthermore, in order to provide an intuitive
explanation of our results, we propose a novel abstraction for reasoning about
Paxos which utilizes write-once registers.

the spectra of 786 IDEOS galaxies. The detections range from single band
detections to detections of all fitted crystalline bands (16, 19, 23, 28 and
33um). We find the strength of the crystalline silicate bands to correlate with
the amorphous silicate strength, and the change from an emission to an
absorption feature to occur at higher obscuration as the wavelength of the
crystalline silicate band is longer. These observed characteristics are
consistent with an origin for the amorphous and crystalline silicate features
in a centrally heated dust geometry, either an edge-on disk or a cocoon. We
find the 23 and 33um crystalline silicate bands to be well-suited to classify
the obscuration level of galactic nuclei, even in the presence of strong
circumnuclear star formation. Based on our detection statistics, we conclude
that crystalline silicates are a common component of the interstellar medium of

  Dataset, http://signal.ee.psu.edu/research/glidenet.html",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Attaching attributes (such as color, shape, state, action) to object
categories is an important computer vision problem. Attribute prediction has
seen exciting recent progress and is often formulated as a multi-label
classification problem. Yet significant challenges remain in: 1) predicting
diverse attributes over multiple categories, 2) modeling attributes-category
dependency, 3) capturing both global and local scene context, and 4) predicting
attributes of objects with low pixel-count. To address these issues, we propose
a novel multi-category attribute prediction deep architecture named GlideNet,
which contains three distinct feature extractors. A global feature extractor
recognizes what objects are present in a scene, whereas a local one focuses on
the area surrounding the object of interest. Meanwhile, an intrinsic feature
extractor uses an extension of standard convolution dubbed Informed Convolution
to retrieve features of objects with low pixel-count. GlideNet uses gating
mechanisms with binary masks and its self-learned category embedding to combine
the dense embeddings. Collectively, the Global-Local-Intrinsic blocks
comprehend the scene's global context while attending to the characteristics of
the local object of interest. Finally, using the combined features, an
interpreter predicts the attributes, and the length of the output is determined
by the category, thereby removing unnecessary attributes. GlideNet can achieve
compelling results on two recent and challenging datasets -- VAW and CAR -- for
large-scale attribute prediction. For instance, it obtains more than 5\% gain
over state of the art in the mean recall (mR) metric. GlideNet's advantages are
especially apparent when predicting attributes of objects with low pixel counts
as well as attributes that demand global context understanding. Finally, we
show that GlideNet excels in training starved real-world scenarios.

importantly, the Tc is shown to sensitively depend on the In2Se3 polarization,
with the higher Tc of ~(8-10) K attributed to enhanced interlayer

a new large eddy simulation (LES) paradigm for efficiently and dynamically
nonlocal LES modeling of the scalar turbulence. To this end, we formulate the
underlying nonlocal model starting from the filtered Boltzmann kinetic
transport equation, where the divergence of subgrid-scale scalar fluxes emerges
as a fractional-order Laplacian term in the filtered advection-diffusion model,
coding the corresponding supper-diffusive nature of scalar turbulence.
Subsequently, we develop a robust data-driven algorithm for estimation of the
fractional (non-integer) Laplacian exponent, where we on-the-fly calculate the
corresponding model coefficient employing a new dynamic procedure. Our
$\textit{a priori}$ tests show that our new dynamically nonlocal LES paradigm
provides better agreements with the ground-truth filtered DNS data in
comparison to the conventional static and dynamic Prandtl-Smagorisnky models.
Moreover, in order to analyze the numerical stability and assessing the model's
performance, we carry out a comprehensive $\textit{a posteriori}$ tests. They
unanimously illustrate that our new model considerably outperforms other
existing functional models, correctly predicting the backscattering phenomena

poses is tedious and erroneous, and also fails to generalize to unseen
scenarios. Besides, category-level pose estimation requires a method to be able
to generalize to unseen objects at test time, which is also challenging.
Drawing inspirations from traditional point pair features (PPFs), in this
paper, we design a novel Category-level PPF (CPPF) voting method to achieve
accurate, robust and generalizable 9D pose estimation in the wild. To obtain
robust pose estimation, we sample numerous point pairs on an object, and for
each pair our model predicts necessary SE(3)-invariant voting statistics on
object centers, orientations and scales. A novel coarse-to-fine voting
algorithm is proposed to eliminate noisy point pair samples and generate final
predictions from the population. To get rid of false positives in the
orientation voting process, an auxiliary binary disambiguating classification
task is introduced for each sampled point pair. In order to detect objects in
the wild, we carefully design our sim-to-real pipeline by training on synthetic
point clouds only, unless objects have ambiguous poses in geometry. Under this
circumstance, color information is leveraged to disambiguate these poses.
Results on standard benchmarks show that our method is on par with current
state of the arts with real-world training data. Extensive experiments further
show that our method is robust to noise and gives promising results under
extremely challenging scenarios. Our code is available on

and the exceptional divisor having simple normal crossings. Moreover, its
geometric quotient is birational to the resolved variety, has abelian quotient
singularities, and can be desingularized directly by combinatorial methods. The
paper is based upon the ideas of the joint work with Abramovich and Temkin and
a similar result by McQuillan on resolution in characteristic zero via
stack-theoretic weighted blow-ups.
  As an application of the method we show the resolution of a certain class of
isolated singularities in positive and mixed characteristic.

paper presents PathBench, a platform for developing, visualizing, training,

path planning algorithms in 2D and 3D grid world environments. Many existing
path planning algorithms are supported; e.g. A*, Dijkstra, waypoint planning
networks, value iteration networks, gated path planning networks; and
integrating new algorithms is easy and clearly specified. The benchmarking
ability of PathBench is explored in this paper by comparing algorithms across
five different hardware systems and three different map types, including
built-in PathBench maps, video game maps, and maps from real world databases.
Metrics, such as path length, success rate, and computational time, were used
to evaluate algorithms. Algorithmic analysis was also performed on a real world

share the same spectrum to send individual messages to their respectively
associated ground base stations (GBSs). The UAV users aim to optimize their
locations to maximize the weighted sum rate. While most existing work considers
simplified line-of-sight (LoS) or statistic air-to-ground (A2G) channel models,
we exploit the location-specific channel knowledge map (CKM) to enhance the
placement performance in practice. However, as the CKMs normally contain
discrete site- and location-specific channel data without analytic model
functions, the corresponding weighted sum rate function becomes
non-differentiable in general. In this case, conventional optimization
techniques relying on function derivatives are inapplicable to solve the
resultant placement optimization problem. To address this issue, we propose a
novel iterative algorithm based on the derivative-free optimization. In each
iteration, we first construct a quadratic function to approximate the
non-differentiable weighted sum rate under a set of interpolation conditions,
and then update the UAVs' placement locations by maximizing the approximate
quadratic function subject to a trust region constraint. Numerical results show
the convergence of the proposed algorithm. It is also shown that the proposed
algorithm achieves a weighted sum rate close to the optimal design based on
exhaustive search with much lower implementation complexity, and it
significantly outperforms the conventional optimization method based on
simplified LoS channel models and the heuristic design with each UAV hovering
above its associated GBS.

ResNets, DenseNets, and other networks with skip connections at the other. For
regression and classification tasks that optimize the squared-error loss, we
show that the optimization loss surface of a modern deep network is piecewise

of a matrix that is a function of the local linear representation. We develop
new perturbation results for how the singular values of matrices of this sort
behave as we add a fraction of the identity and multiply by certain diagonal
matrices. A direct application of our perturbation results explains
analytically why a network with skip connections (such as a ResNet or DenseNet)
is easier to optimize than a ConvNet: thanks to its more stable singular values
and smaller condition number, the local loss surface of such a network is less
erratic, less eccentric, and features local minima that are more accommodating

management and public safety. However, this problem is challenging due to the
spatial heterogeneity of the environment and the sparsity of accidents in space
and time. The occurrence of traffic accidents is affected by complex
dependencies among spatial and temporal features. Recent traffic accident
prediction methods have attempted to use deep learning models to improve
accuracy. However, most of these methods either focus on small-scale and
homogeneous areas such as populous cities or simply use sliding-window-based
ensemble methods, which are inadequate to handle heterogeneity in large
regions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Hierarchical
Knowledge Transfer Network (HintNet) model to better capture irregular
heterogeneity patterns. HintNet performs a multi-level spatial partitioning to
separate sub-regions with different risks and learns a deep network model for
each level using spatio-temporal and graph convolutions. Through knowledge
transfer across levels, HintNet archives both higher accuracy and higher
training efficiency. Extensive experiments on a real-world accident dataset
from the state of Iowa demonstrate that HintNet outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on spatially heterogeneous and large-scale areas.

for parameters of abilities of examinees and difficulties of problems by using
the observed item response matrix consisting of 0/1 value elements. Many papers
discuss the performance of the estimates. However, this paper does not. Using
the maximum likelihood estimates, we can reconstruct the estimated item
response matrix. Then we can assess the accuracy of this reconstructed matrix
to the observed response matrix from the matrix decomposition perspective. That
is, this paper focuses on the performance of the reconstructed response matrix.
To compare the performance of the item response theory with others, we provided
the two kinds of low rank response matrix by approximating the observed
response matrix; one is the matrix via the singular value decomposition method
when the response matrix is a complete matrix, and the other is the matrix via
the matrix decomposition method when the response matrix is an incomplete
matrix. We have, firstly, found that the performance of the singular value
decomposition method and the matrix decomposition method is almost the same
when the response matrix is a complete matrix. Here, the performance is
measured by the closeness between the two matrices using the root mean squared
errors and the accuracy. Secondary, we have seen that the closeness of the
reconstructed matrix obtained from the item response theory to the observed
matrix is located between the two approximated low rank response matrices
obtained from the matrix decomposition method of k= and k=2 to the observed
matrix, where k indicates the first k columns use in the decomposed matrices.

three components, $t_{\rm abs}$, $t_{\rm path}$ and $t_{\rm sc}$, which are
atomic photoemission time delay, delays caused by the propagation of
photoelectron among the surrounding atoms and the scattering of photoelectron
by them, respectively. We applied single scattering approximation to $t_{\rm

synthesize adversarial face images with makeup transferred from reference

joint training strategy to reconcile the conflicts between the adversarial
noises and the cycle consistence loss in makeup transfer, achieving a desirable
balance between the attack strength and visual changes. Extensive experiments
verify that compared with state of the arts, AMT-GAN can not only preserve a
comfortable visual quality, but also achieve a higher attack success rate over
commercial FR APIs, including Face++, Aliyun, and Microsoft.

and spectroscopy yield bespoke data sets containing the information of
structure and functionality of complex systems. In many cases, the resulting
data sets are underpinned by low-dimensional simple representations encoding
the factors of variability within the data. The representation learning methods
seek to discover these factors of variability, ideally further connecting them
with relevant physical mechanisms. However, generally the task of identifying
the latent variables corresponding to actual physical mechanisms is extremely
complex. Here, we explore an approach based on conditioning the data on the
known (continuous) physical parameters, and systematically compare it with the
previously introduced approach based on the invariant variational autoencoders.
The conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) approach does not rely on the
existence of the invariant transforms, and hence allows for much greater
flexibility and applicability. Interestingly, cVAE allows for limited
extrapolation outside of the original domain of the conditional variable.
However, this extrapolation is limited compared to the cases when true physical
mechanisms are known, and the physical factor of variability can be
disentangled in full. We further show that introducing the known conditioning
results in the simplification of the latent distribution if the conditioning
vector is correlated with the factor of variability in the data, thus allowing
to separate relevant physical factors. We initially demonstrate this approach
using 1D and 2D examples on a synthetic dataset and then extend it to the
analysis of experimental data on ferroelectric domain dynamics visualized via
Piezoresponse Force Microscopy.

adversarial attacks. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we first
propose a novel platform called auto adversarial attack and defense ($A^{3}D$),
which can help search for robust neural network architectures and efficient
adversarial attacks. In $A^{3}D$, we employ multiple neural architecture search
methods, which consider different robustness evaluation metrics, including four
types of noises: adversarial noise, natural noise, system noise, and quantified
metrics, resulting in finding robust architectures. Besides, we propose a
mathematical model for auto adversarial attack, and provide multiple
optimization algorithms to search for efficient adversarial attacks. In
addition, we combine auto adversarial attack and defense together to form a
unified framework. Among auto adversarial defense, the searched efficient
attack can be used as the new robustness evaluation to further enhance the
robustness. In auto adversarial attack, the searched robust architectures can
be utilized as the threat model to help find stronger adversarial attacks.
Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed platform, which can also provide
a benchmark and toolkit for researchers in the application of automated machine

system between two supersymmetric Hamiltonians. Such a quench can be created by
carefully changing the external trapping potential and leads to a situation
where the eigenspectra before and after the quench are nearly identical. We
show that the dynamics originating from this can be conveniently described
using knowledge about the initial state only and apply this insight to the
specific example of a fermionic gas that is initially trapped in an infinite
box potential. Quenching to different, higher order supersymmetric partners
potentials we observe the appearance of many-body revivals in the survival
probability and show that some of these are robust at finite temperatures. This
is in contrast to the well known Talbot effect, which is the standard example
for quenching into a system with a quadratic spectrum.

only tuning continuous prompts with a frozen pre-trained language model (PLM),
prompt-tuning takes a step towards deploying a shared frozen PLM to serve
numerous downstream tasks. Although prompt-tuning shows good performance on
certain natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, its effectiveness on
natural language generation (NLG) tasks is still under-explored. In this paper,
we argue that one of the factors hindering the development of prompt-tuning on
NLG tasks is the unfamiliar inputs (i.e., inputs are linguistically different
from the pretraining corpus). For example, our preliminary exploration reveals
a large performance gap between prompt-tuning and fine-tuning when unfamiliar
inputs occur frequently in NLG tasks. This motivates us to propose
input-tuning, which fine-tunes both the continuous prompts and the input
representations, leading to a more effective way to adapt unfamiliar inputs to
frozen PLMs. Our proposed input-tuning is conceptually simple and empirically
powerful. Experimental results on seven NLG tasks demonstrate that input-tuning
is significantly and consistently better than prompt-tuning. Furthermore, on
three of these tasks, input-tuning can achieve a comparable or even better
performance than fine-tuning.

the well-known $k$-means clustering algorithm has been shown to be
implementable on a quantum computer with a significant speedup. However, many
clustering problems cannot be solved by $k$-means, and a powerful method called
spectral clustering is introduced to solve these problems. In this work, we
propose a circuit design to implement spectral clustering on a quantum
processor with a substantial speedup, by initializing the processor into a
maximally entangled state and encoding the data information into an
efficiently-simulatable Hamiltonian. Compared with the established quantum
$k$-means algorithms, our method does not require a quantum random access
memory or a quantum adiabatic process. It relies on an appropriate embedding of
quantum phase estimation into Grover's search to gain the quantum speedup.
Simulations demonstrate that our method is effective in solving clustering
problems and will serve as an important supplement to quantum $k$-means for
unsupervised learning.

cascades in air, an Extensive Air Shower (EAS), emitting coherent radio
emission. This emission is affected by the presence of strong electric fields
during thunderstorm conditions. To reconstruct the atmospheric electric field
from the measured radio footprint of the EAS we use an analytic model for the
calculation of the radio emission, MGMR3D. In this work we make an extensive
comparison between the results of a microscopic model for radio emission,
CoREAS, to obtain an improved parametrization for MGMR3D in the presence of
atmospheric electric fields, as well as confidence intervals. The approach to
extract the electric field structure is applied successfully to an event with a

generalization of phase retrieval to the setting of subspaces of $L_2$ which
coincides with using a continuous frame for phase retrieval when the subspace
is the range of the analysis operator of a continuous frame. We then prove that
there do exist infinite dimensional subspaces of $L_2$ where phase retrieval is
stable. That is, we give a method for constructing an infinite dimensional
subspace $Y\subseteq L_2$ such that there exists $C\geq 1$ so that
$$\min\big(\big\|f-g\big\|_{L_2},\big\|f+g\big\|_{L_2}\big)\leq C \big\|

  This construction also leads to new results on uniform stability of phase
retrieval in finite dimensions. Our construction has a deterministic component
and a random component. When using sub-Gaussian random variables we achieve
phase retrieval with high probability and stability constant independent of the
dimension $n$ when using $m$ on the order of $n$ random vectors. Without
sub-Gaussian or any other higher moment assumptions, we are able to achieve
phase retrieval with high probability and stability constant independent of the

incorporates an attribute$\rightarrow$visual attention sub-net that learns

fundamental questions about its chemical bonding are still being hotly debated.
The complex electronic structure of C$_2$ is a consequence of its dense
manifold of near-degenerate, low-lying electronic states. A global multi-state
diabatic model is proposed here to disentangle the numerous configuration
interactions within four symmetry manifolds of C$_2$ ($^{1}\Pi_g$, $^{3}\Pi_g$,
$^{1}\Sigma_u^+$, and $^{3}\Sigma_u^+$). The key concept of our model is the
existence of two ""valence-hole"" configurations,
$2\sigma_g^22\sigma_u^11\pi_{u}^33\sigma_g^2$ for $^{1,3}\Pi_g$ states and
$2\sigma_g^22\sigma_u^11\pi_{u}^43\sigma_g^1$ for $^{1,3}\Sigma_u^+$ states
that derive from $3\sigma_g\leftarrow2\sigma_u$ electron promotion. The
lowest-energy state from each of the four C$_2$ symmetry species is dominated
by this type of valence-hole configuration at its equilibrium internuclear
separation. As a result of their large binding energy (nominal bond order of 3)
and correlation with the 2s$^2$2p$^2$+2s2p$^3$ separated-atom configurations,
the presence of these valence-hole configurations has a profound impact on the

investigated in the framework of the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF)
model with a high-precision realistic nuclear potential, pvCDBonn A. The
kinetic energy and potential contributions to symmetry energy are decomposed.
They are explicitly expressed by the nucleon self-energies, which are obtained
through projecting the $G$-matrices from the RBHF model into the terms of
Lorentz covariants. The nuclear medium effects on the nucleon self-energy and
nucleon-nucleon interaction in symmetry energy are discussed by comparing the
results from the RBHF model and those from Hartree-Fock and relativistic
Hartree-Fock models. It is found that the nucleon self-energy including the
nuclear medium effect on the single-nucleon wave function provides a largely
positive contribution to the symmetry energy, while {the nuclear medium effect
on the nucleon-nucleon interaction, i.e., the effective $G$-matrices generates
the negative contribution}. The tensor force plays an essential role in the
symmetry energy around the density. The scalar and vector covariant amplitudes
of nucleon-nucleon interaction dominate the potential component of the symmetry
energy. Furthermore, the isoscalar and isovector terms in the optical potential
are extracted from the RBHF model. The isoscalar part is consistent with the
results from the analysis of global optical potential, while the isovector one
has obvious differences at higher incident energy due to the relativistic
effect.

especially successful and sustainable ones. But many OSS projects do not become
sustainable, resulting in abandonment and even risks for the world's digital
infrastructure. Prior work has looked at the reasons for this mainly from two
very different perspectives. In software engineering, the focus has been on
understanding success and sustainability from the socio-technical perspective:
the OSS programmers' day-to-day activities and the artifacts they create. In
institutional analysis, on the other hand, emphasis has been on institutional
designs (e.g., policies, rules, and norms) that structure governance. Even
though each is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of OSS projects, the
connection and interaction between the two approaches have been barely
explored.
  In this paper, we make the first effort toward understanding OSS project
sustainability using a dual-view analysis, by combining institutional analysis
with socio-technical systems analysis. In particular, we (i) use linguistic
approaches to extract institutional rules and norms from OSS contributors'
communications to represent the evolution of their governance systems, and (ii)
construct socio-technical networks based on longitudinal collaboration records
to represent each project's organizational structure. We combined the two
methods and applied them to a dataset of developer traces from 253 nascent OSS
projects within the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) incubator. We find that
the socio-technical and institutional features relate to each other, and
provide complementary views into the progress of the ASF's OSS projects.
Refining these combined analyses can help provide a more precise understanding
of the synchronization between the evolution of institutional governance and
organizational structure.

they instead prefer other model-based approaches for some image regression
problems, and according to the 2021 IEEE International Roadmap for Devices and
Systems (IRDS) report on Metrology a SEMI standardization committee may endorse
this philosophy. The semiconductor manufacturing community does, however,
communicate a need for state-of-the-art statistical analyses to reduce
measurement uncertainty. Prediction intervals which characterize the
reliability of the predictive performance of regression models can impact
decisions, build trust in machine learning, and be applied to other regression
models. However, we are not aware of effective and sufficiently simple
distribution-free approaches that offer valid coverage for important classes of
image data, so we consider the distribution-free conformal prediction and
conformalized quantile regression framework.The image regression problem that
is the focus of this paper pertains to line edge roughness (LER) estimation
from noisy scanning electron microscopy images. LER affects semiconductor
device performance and reliability as well as the yield of the manufacturing
process; the 2021 IRDS emphasizes the crucial importance of LER by devoting a
white paper to it in addition to mentioning or discussing it in the reports of
multiple international focus teams. It is not immediately apparent how to
effectively use normalized conformal prediction and quantile regression for LER

oscillators converge to the all-in-phase synchronous state for almost all
initial conditions. Is there a critical threshold for $p$ above which global
synchrony is extremely likely but below which it is extremely rare? It is
suspected that a critical threshold exists and is close to the so-called

they showed that if $p\gg \log(n)/n^{1/3}$, then \ER networks of Kuramoto

interacting particles, phase transitions continue to be difficult to predict
using statistical thermodynamics. A recent proposal called the topological
hypothesis suggests that the existence of a phase transition could perhaps be
inferred from changes to the topology of the accessible part of the
configuration space. This paper instead suggests that such a topological change
is often associated with a dramatic change in the configuration space geometry,
and that the geometric change is the actual driver of the phase transition.
More precisely, a geometric change that brings about a discontinuity in the
mixing time required for an initial probability distribution on the
configuration space to reach steady-state is conjectured to be related to the
onset of a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. This conjecture is
tested by evaluating the diffusion diameter and $\epsilon$-mixing time of the
configuration spaces of hard disk and hard sphere systems of increasing size.
Explicit geometries are constructed for the configuration spaces of these
systems, and numerical evidence suggests that a discontinuity in the
$\epsilon$-mixing time coincides with the solid-fluid phase transition in the
thermodynamic limit.

ability for some particular problem instance. The goal of this paper is to
sharply characterize the generalization of multi-pass SGD, by developing an
instance-dependent excess risk bound for least squares in the interpolation
regime, which is expressed as a function of the iteration number, stepsize, and
data covariance. We show that the excess risk of SGD can be exactly decomposed
into the excess risk of GD and a positive fluctuation error, suggesting that
SGD always performs worse, instance-wisely, than GD, in generalization. On the
other hand, we show that although SGD needs more iterations than GD to achieve
the same level of excess risk, it saves the number of stochastic gradient
evaluations, and therefore is preferable in terms of computational time.

electronic state of Pt nanoparticles, we performed 195Pt NMR experiments on
thiol-capped Pt nanoparticles with three different average diameters of less
than 3 nm. For the nanoparticles with a diameter of 2.8 nm, we observed usual
metallic behavior with a smaller density of states than that of the bulk Pt. In
contrast, the temperature dependence of 1/T1T in nanoparticles less than 2.5 nm
in diameter is an activation-energy form above 150 K, which is semiconducting
behavior with an energy gap of the order of 2000 K. The significant decrease in
1/T1T by more than two orders of magnitude in the smaller Pt nanoparticles
compared to the bulk Pt is attributable to the disappearance of the density of
states at the Fermi energy, which is consistent with the opening of an energy
gap. These results indicate a metal-insulator transition below 2.5 nm in

a minimax principle for right eigenvalues of dual quaternion Hermitian

interaural time difference (ITD), respectively. The improvement effects of the
proposed methods on binaural sound localization cues were investigated. To
achieve sufficient frequency bandwidth with a single source, a one-way sealed
speaker module was designed to obtain wide band frequency response based on
electro-acoustics, whereas most existing HRTF databases rely on a two-way
vented loudspeaker that has multiple sources. The origin transfer function at
the head center was obtained by the proposed measurement scheme using a 0
degree on-axis microphone to ensure accurate spectral cue pattern of HRTFs,
whereas in the previous measurements with a 90 degree off-axis microphone, the
magnitude response of the origin transfer function fluctuated and decreased
with increasing frequency, causing erroneous SCs of HRTFs. To prevent
discontinuity of ITD due to non-causality of ipsilateral HRTFs, obtained HRIRs
were circularly shifted by time delay considering the head radius of the
measurement subject. Finally, various sound localization cues such as ITD,
interaural level difference (ILD), SC, and horizontal plane directivity (HPD)
were derived from the presented HRTFs, and improvements on binaural sound
localization cues were examined. As a result, accurate SC patterns of HRTFs
were confirmed through the proposed measurement scheme using the 0 degree

from cavitation in fluids to recrystallization in solids. Computational
modeling of interface motion entails a number of challenges, many of which are
related to the range of topological transitions that can occur over the course
of the simulation. Microstructure evolution in a polycrystalline material that
involves grain boundary motion is a particularly complex example due to the
extreme variety, heterogeneity, and anisotropy of grain boundary properties.
Accurately modeling this process is essential to determining
processing-structure-property relationships in polycrystalline materials
though. Simulations of microstructure evolution in such materials often use
diffuse interface methods like the phase field method that are advantageous for
their versatility and ease of handling complex geometries but can be
prohibitively expensive due to the need for high interface resolution. Discrete
interface methods require fewer grid points and can consequently exhibit better
performance but have received comparatively little attention, perhaps due to
the difficulties of maintaining the mesh and consistently implementing
topological transitions on the grain boundary network. This work explicitly
compares a recently-developed discrete interface method to a multiphase field
method on several classical problems relating to microstructure evolution in
polcrystalline materials: a shrinking spherical grain, the steady-state triple
junction dihedral angle, and the steady-state quadruple point dihedral angle.
In each case, the discrete method is found to meet or outperform the multiphase
field method with respect to accuracy for comparable levels of refinement,
demonstrating its potential efficacy as a numerical approach for microstructure
evolution in polycrystalline materials.

in dialogue response generation, chatbots still suffer from generating
inconsistent responses in real-world practice, especially in multi-turn

the golden context, while it has to generate based on the context consisting of
both user utterances and the model predicted utterances during real-world

more serious in the multi-turn settings. In this paper, we propose a
hierarchical sampling-based method consisting of both utterance-level sampling
and semi-utterance-level sampling, to alleviate the discrepancy, which
implicitly increases the dialogue coherence. We further adopt reinforcement
learning and re-ranking methods to explicitly optimize the dialogue coherence
during training and inference, respectively. Empirical experiments show the

linear perturbations of the final Kerr black hole, and a nonlinear region. At
late times, the boundary between the two regions is an infalling shell. The BHP
region contains late-time gravitational-waves emitted toward the future

by imposing no-ingoing wave conditions at past null infinity, and matching
out-going waves at future null infinity with waveforms computed from numerical

these echoes in current and future detectors, and prospects for parameter

based on a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model with $\Omega_\mathrm{m0}=0.3$ and

be favored mildly since it has the least model parameters. Furthermore, once

it is still challenging to use learning-based methods under uncertain
environments while stability, safety, and real-time performance of the system
are desired to guarantee. In this paper, we propose a learning-based tracking
control scheme based on a feedback linearization controller in which uncertain
disturbances are approximated online using Gaussian Processes (GPs). Using the
predicted distribution of disturbances given by GPs, a Control Lyapunov
Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) based Quadratic Program is
applied, with which probabilistic stability and safety are guaranteed. In
addition, the trajectory is optimized first by Model Predictive Control (MPC)
based on the linearized dynamics systems to further reduce the tracking error.
We also design an event trigger for GPs updates to improve efficiency while
stability and safety of the system are still guaranteed. The effectiveness of
the proposed tracking control strategy is illustrated in numerical simulations.

  Tracking",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep Siamese trackers have recently gained much attention in recent years
since they can track visual objects at high speeds. Additionally, adaptive
tracking methods, where target samples collected by the tracker are employed
for online learning, have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. However, single
object tracking (SOT) remains a challenging task in real-world application due
to changes and deformations in a target object's appearance. Learning on all
the collected samples may lead to catastrophic forgetting, and thereby corrupt
the tracking model.
  In this paper, SOT is formulated as an online incremental learning problem. A
new method is proposed for dynamic sample selection and memory replay,
preventing template corruption. In particular, we propose a change detection
mechanism to detect gradual changes in object appearance and select the
corresponding samples for online adaption. In addition, an entropy-based sample
selection strategy is introduced to maintain a diversified auxiliary buffer for
memory replay. Our proposed method can be integrated into any object tracking
algorithm that leverages online learning for model adaptation.
  Extensive experiments conducted on the OTB-100, LaSOT, UAV123, and
TrackingNet datasets highlight the cost-effectiveness of our method, along with
the contribution of its key components. Results indicate that integrating our
proposed method into state-of-art adaptive Siamese trackers can increase the
potential benefits of a template update strategy, and significantly improve
performance.

problem with $k$ unknown reward distributions, which are heavy-tailed and
corrupted by a history-independent adversary or Nature. To be specific, the
reward obtained by playing an arm comes from corresponding heavy-tailed reward
distribution with probability $1-\varepsilon \in (0.5,1]$ and an arbitrary
corruption distribution of unbounded support with probability $\varepsilon \in
[0,0.5)$.
  First, we provide $\textit{a problem-dependent lower bound on the regret}$ of
any corrupted bandit algorithm. The lower bounds indicate that the corrupted
bandit problem is harder than the classical stochastic bandit problem with
sub-Gaussian or heavy-tail rewards.
  Following that, we propose a novel UCB-type algorithm for corrupted bandits,
namely HubUCB, that builds on Huber's estimator for robust mean estimation.
Leveraging a novel concentration inequality of Huber's estimator, we prove that
HubUCB achieves a near-optimal regret upper bound.
  Since computing Huber's estimator has quadratic complexity, we further
introduce a sequential version of Huber's estimator that exhibits linear
complexity. We leverage this sequential estimator to design SeqHubUCB that
enjoys similar regret guarantees while reducing the computational burden.
  Finally, we experimentally illustrate the efficiency of HubUCB and SeqHubUCB
in solving corrupted bandits for different reward distributions and different
levels of corruptions.

transfer knowledge from several well-trained teachers to a multi-talented and

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, there is a tendency that
transformers, with a completely different architecture, are starting to
challenge the domination of CNNs in many computer vision tasks. Nevertheless,
directly applying the previous KA methods to transformers leads to severe
performance degradation. In this work, we explore a more effective KA scheme
for transformer-based object detection models. Specifically, considering the
architecture characteristics of transformers, we propose to dissolve the KA
into two aspects: sequence-level amalgamation (SA) and task-level amalgamation
(TA). In particular, a hint is generated within the sequence-level amalgamation
by concatenating teacher sequences instead of redundantly aggregating them to a
fixed-size one as previous KA works. Besides, the student learns heterogeneous
detection tasks through soft targets with efficiency in the task-level
amalgamation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO have unfolded that
the sequence-level amalgamation significantly boosts the performance of
students, while the previous methods impair the students. Moreover, the
transformer-based students excel in learning amalgamated knowledge, as they
have mastered heterogeneous detection tasks rapidly and achieved superior or at
least comparable performance to those of the teachers in their specializations.

clients are still reluctant to join FL given the communication cost and energy
consumption in their mobile devices. It is important to design pricing
compensations to motivate enough clients to join FL and distributively train
the global model. Prior pricing mechanisms for FL are static and cannot adapt
to clients' random arrival pattern over time. We propose a new dynamic pricing
solution in closed-form by constructing the Hamiltonian function to optimally
balance the client recruitment time and the model training time, without
knowing clients' actual arrivals or training costs. During the client
recruitment phase, we offer time-dependent monetary rewards per client arrival
to trade-off between the total payment and the FL model's accuracy loss. Such
reward gradually increases when we approach to the recruitment deadline or have
greater data aging, and we also extend the deadline if the clients' training
time per iteration becomes shorter. Further, we extend to consider
heterogeneous client types in training data size and training time per
iteration. We successfully extend our dynamic pricing solution and develop an
optimal algorithm of linear complexity to monotonically select client types for
FL. Finally, we also show the robustness of our solution against estimation
error of clients' data sizes and run numerical experiments to validate our
conclusion.

orbiting a bright (G = 8.9 mag), young ($340\pm80$ Myr) K-type star. Although a
validated planetary system, the orbits of the two outer planets were
unconstrained as only two non-consecutive transits were seen in TESS
photometry. This left 11 and 7 possible period aliases for each.
  Aims: To reveal the true orbits of these two long-period planets, precise
photometry targeted on the highest-probability period aliases is required.
Long-term monitoring of transits in multi-planet systems can also help
constrain planetary masses through TTV measurements.
  Methods: We used the MonoTools package to determine which aliases to follow,
and then performed space-based and ground-based photometric follow-up of
TOI-2076 c and d with CHEOPS, SAINT-EX, and LCO telescopes.
  Results: CHEOPS observations revealed a clear detection for TOI-2076 c at
$P=21.01538^{+0.00084}_{-0.00074}$ d, and allowed us to rule out three of the
most likely period aliases for TOI-2076 d. Ground-based photometry further
enabled us to rule out remaining aliases and confirm the $P=35.12537\pm0.00067$
d alias. These observations also improved the radius precision of all three
sub-Neptunes to $2.518\pm0.036$, $3.497\pm0.043$, and $3.232\pm0.063$
$R_\oplus$. Our observations also revealed a clear anti-correlated TTV signal
between planets b and c likely caused by their proximity to the 2:1 resonance,
while planets c and d appear close to a 5:3 period commensurability, although
model degeneracy meant we were unable to retrieve robust TTV masses. Their
inflated radii, likely due to extended H-He atmospheres, combined with low
insolation makes all three planets excellent candidates for future comparative
transmission spectroscopy with JWST.

using image-caption pairs in the training phase. Although challenging, we
except the task can be accomplished by leveraging a training set of images
aligned with visual concepts. Most existing studies use off-the-shelf
algorithms to obtain the visual concepts because the Bounding Box (BBox) labels
or relationship-triplet labels used for the training are expensive to acquire.
In order to resolve the problem in expensive annotations, we propose a novel
approach to achieve cost-effective UIC. Specifically, we adopt image-level
labels for the optimization of the UIC model in a weakly-supervised manner. For
each image, we assume that only the image-level labels are available without
specific locations and numbers. The image-level labels are utilized to train a
weakly-supervised object recognition model to extract object information (e.g.,
instance) in an image, and the extracted instances are adopted to infer the
relationships among different objects based on an enhanced graph neural network
(GNN). The proposed approach achieves comparable or even better performance
compared with previous methods without the expensive cost of annotations.
Furthermore, we design an unrecognized object (UnO) loss combined with a visual
concept reward to improve the alignment of the inferred object and relationship
information with the images. It can effectively alleviate the issue encountered
by existing UIC models about generating sentences with nonexistent objects. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to solve the problem of
Weakly-Supervised visual concept recognition for UIC (WS-UIC) based only on
image-level labels. Extensive experiments have been carried out to demonstrate
that the proposed WS-UIC model achieves inspiring results on the COCO dataset
while significantly reducing the cost of labeling.

electronic states of condensed matter. However, electric fields usually do not
work in metals as free carriers tend to screen electrostatic fields. While a
pseudo-electric field generated by inhomogeneous lattice strain, namely a
flexoelectric field, can in principle work in all classes of materials, it
remains experimentally unexplored in metals. Here, using heteroepitaxy and
atomic-scale imaging, we show that flexoelectric fields can polarize a metallic
oxide SrRuO3 with unexpectedly large Ru off-center displacements. We also
observe that the flexoelectrically induced polar state of SrRuO3 leads to
sizable lattice expansion, similar to the electrostrictive expansion caused by
ionic displacements in dielectrics under an external electric field. We further
suggest that flexoelectrically driven Ru off-centering promotes strong coupling
between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom, possibly enhancing the
ferromagnetism of SrRuO3. Beyond conventional electric fields, flexoelectric
fields may universally engender novel electronic states and their control via
pure atomic displacements in a nondestructive and fast manner.

the planned trajectory is not collision-free. We propose a message passing
algorithm that is more sensitive to obstacles with fast convergence time. We
leverage the utility of min-sum message passing algorithm that performs local
computations at each node to solve the inference problem on factor graph. We
first introduce the notion of compound factor node to transform the factor
graph to a linearly structured graph. We next develop an algorithm denoted as
Min-sum Message Passing algorithm for Motion Planning (MS2MP) that combines
numerical optimization with message passing to find collision-free
trajectories. MS2MP performs numerical optimization to solve non-linear least
square minimization problem at each compound factor node and then exploits the
linear structure of factor graph to compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation of complete graph by passing messages among graph nodes. The
decentralized optimization approach of each compound node increases sensitivity
towards avoiding obstacles for harder planning problems. We evaluate our
algorithm by performing extensive experiments for exemplary motion planning
tasks for a robot manipulator. Our evaluation reveals that MS2MP improves

provide resolutions to both the black hole and big bang singularities. In the

quantum corrected black hole metric is constructed. This metric is also known
as self-dual spacetime since the form of the metric is invariant under the
exchange $r \to a_0/r$ with $a_0$ being proportional to the minimum area in LQG

the Schwarzschild spacetime by the polymeric function $P$, purely due to the
geometric quantum effects from LQG. Here $P$ is related to the polymeric

star forming regions of N44, N79 and N11 based on the IRSF/SIRIUS point source
catalog. The 3D AV maps are compared with the hydrogen column densities N(H) of
three different velocity components where one is of the LMC disk velocity and
the other two are of velocities lower than the disk velocity. As a result, we
obtain 3D dust geometry suggesting that gas collision is on-going between the
different velocity components. We also find difference in the timing of the gas
collision between the massive star forming regions, which indicates that the
gas collision in N44, N79 and N11 occurred later than that in 30 Doradus. In
addition, difference by a factor of two in Av/N(H) is found between the
velocity components for N44, while significant difference is not found for N79
and N11. From the 3D geometry and Av/N(H) in each star forming region, we
suggest that the massive star formation in N44 was induced by an external
trigger of tidal interaction between the LMC and the SMC, while that in N79 and
N11 is likely to have been induced by internal triggers such as gas converging
from the galactic spiral arm and expansion of a supershell although the
possibility of tidal interaction cannot be ruled out.

paper, we deal with this misalignment by achieving the class-conditioned
transferring from a new perspective. We aim to maximize the conditional
independence of feature and domain given class in the reproducing kernel
Hilbert space. The optimization of the conditional independence measure can be
viewed as minimizing a surrogate of a certain mutual information between
feature and domain. An interpretable empirical estimation of the conditional
dependence is deduced and connected with the unconditional case. Besides, we
provide an upper bound on the target error by taking the class-conditional
distribution into account, which provides a new theoretical insight for most
class-conditioned transferring methods. In addition to unsupervised domain
adaptation, we extend our method to the multi-source scenario in a natural and
elegant way. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate the

in the disk atmosphere are of particular interest, as they are connected to the
wind-launching mechanism. In this work, we study the polarization of the light
scattered off of magnetically aligned grains in the disk atmosphere, focusing
on the deviation of the polarization orientation from the canonical azimuthal
direction, which may be detectable in near-IR polarimetry with instruments such
as VLT/SPHERE. We show with a simple disk model that the polarization can even
be oriented along the radial (rather than azimuthal) direction, especially in
highly inclined disks with toroidally dominated magnetic fields. This
polarization reversal is caused by the anisotropy in the polarizibility of
aligned grains and is thus a telltale sign of such grains. We show that the
near-IR light is scattered mostly by $\mu$m-sized grains or smaller at the
$\tau=1$ surface and such grains can be magnetically aligned if they contain
superparamagnetic inclusions. For comparison with observations, we generate
synthetic maps of the ratios of $U_\phi/I$ and $Q_\phi/I$, which can be used to
infer the existence of (magnetically) aligned grains through a negative
$Q_\phi$ (polarization reversal) and/or a significant level of $U_\phi/I$. We
show that two features observed in the existing data, an asymmetric
distribution of $U_\phi$ with respect to the disk minor axis and a spatial
distribution of $U_\phi$ that is predominantly positive or negative, are
incompatible with scattering by spherical grains in an axisymmetric disk. They
provide indirect evidences for scattering by aligned non-spherical grains.

physics and material science. However, to date, most of the established
topological states of matter have been employed in Euclidean systems, where the
interplay between unique geometrical characteristics of curved spaces and
exotic topological phases is less explored, especially on the experimental
perspective. Recently, the experimental realization of the hyperbolic lattice,
which is the regular tessellation in non-Euclidean spaces with a constant
negative curvature, has attracted much attention in the field of simulating
exotic phenomena from quantum physics in curved spaces to the general
relativity. The question is whether there are novel topological states in such
a non-Euclidean system without analogues in Euclidean spaces. Here, we
demonstrate both in theory and experiment that novel topological states
possessing unique properties compared with their Euclidean counterparts can
exist in engineered hyperbolic lattices. Specially, based on the extended
Haldane model, the boundary-dominated first-order Chern edge state with a
nontrivial real-space Chern number is achieved, and the associated one-way
propagation is proven. Furthermore, we show that fractal-like midgap
higher-order zero modes appear in deformed hyperbolic lattices, where the
number of zero modes increases exponentially with the increase of lattice size.
These novel topological states are observed in designed hyperbolic circuit
networks by measuring site-resolved impendence responses and dynamics of
voltage packets. Our findings suggest a novel platform to study topological
phases beyond Euclidean space and may have potential applications in the field
of designing high-efficient topological devices, such as topological lasers,
with extremely fewer trivial regions.

self-attention (XSA-LID) model with knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance its
language identification (LID) performance for both long and short utterances.
The dual-mode XSA-LID model is trained by jointly optimizing both the full and
short modes with their respective inputs being the full-length speech and its
short clip extracted by a specific Boolean mask, and KD is applied to further
boost the performance on short utterances. In addition, we investigate the
impact of clip-wise linguistic variability and lexical integrity for LID by
analyzing the variation of LID performance in terms of the lengths and
positions of the mimicked speech clips. We evaluated our approach on the MLS14
data from the NIST 2017 LRE. With the 3~s random-location Boolean mask, our
proposed method achieved 19.23%, 21.52% and 8.37% relative improvement in
average cost compared with the XSA-LID model on 3s, 10s, and 30s speech,
respectively.

  Carlo",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Importance sampling (IS) is valuable in reducing the variance of Monte Carlo
sampling for many areas, including finance, rare event simulation, and Bayesian
inference. It is natural and obvious to combine quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods
with IS to achieve a faster rate of convergence. However, a naive replacement
of Monte Carlo with QMC may not work well. This paper investigates the
convergence rates of randomized QMC-based IS for estimating integrals with
respect to a Gaussian measure, in which the IS measure is a Gaussian or $t$
distribution. We prove that if the target function satisfies the so-called
boundary growth condition and the covariance matrix of the IS density has
eigenvalues no smaller than 1, then randomized QMC with the Gaussian proposal
has a root mean squared error of $O(N^{-1+\epsilon})$ for arbitrarily small
$\epsilon>0$. Similar results of $t$ distribution as the proposal are also
established. These sufficient conditions help to assess the effectiveness of IS
in QMC. For some particular applications, we find that the Laplace IS, a very
general approach to approximate the target function by a quadratic Taylor
approximation around its mode, has eigenvalues smaller than 1, making the
resulting integrand less favorable for QMC. From this point of view, when using
Gaussian distributions as the IS proposal, a change of measure via Laplace IS
may transform a favorable integrand into unfavorable one for QMC although the
variance of Monte Carlo sampling is reduced. We also give some examples to
verify our propositions and warn against naive replacement of MC with QMC under
IS proposals. Numerical results suggest that using Laplace IS with $t$
distributions is more robust than that with Gaussian distributions.

spectral clustering framework that can address both directed and undirected

respect to an arbitrary positive regularizing measure on the graph edges. We
also propose a practical parametrization of the regularizing measure
constructed from the iterated powers of the natural random walk on the graph.
We present theoretical arguments to explain the efficiency of our framework in

joint distribution over coupled random variables on a factor graph. Leveraging

The computational efficiency of this approach can be used in competitive

the tangential geometry and structural properties inherent in the minimum
curvature planning problem, we represent it on a factor graph, which is
subsequently solved via sparse least-squares optimization. The results obtained
by performing comparative analysis with the quadratic programming-based

behavior of confined liquids, detailed knowledge of this phenomenon,
particularly in the mixed/boundary lubrication regime, remains limited. This
can be attributed to several factors including the difficulty of direct
experimental observations of the behavior of lubricant molecules under
non-equilibrium conditions, the high computational cost of molecular
simulations to reach steady state, and the low signal-to-noise ratio at
extremely low shear rates corresponding to actual operating conditions. To this
end, we studied the correlation between the structure formation and shear
viscosity of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane confined between two mica surfaces in
a mixed/boundary lubrication regime. Three different surface separations
corresponding to two-, three-, and five-layered structures were considered to
analyze the effect of confinement. The orientational distributions with one
specific peak for $n=2$ and two distributions, including a parallel orientation
with the surface normal for $n>2$, were observed at rest. The confined liquids
exhibited a distinct shear-thinning behavior independent of surface separations
for a relatively low sliding velocity, $V_{\rm x}\lesssim 10^{-1}\,{\rm m/s}$.
However, the shear viscosities at $V_{\rm x}\lesssim 10^{-1}\,{\rm m/s}$
depended on the number of layered structures. Newtonian behavior was observed
with a further increase in the sliding velocity. Furthermore, we found a strong
correlation between the degree of molecular orientation and the shear viscosity
of the confined liquids. The magnitude of the shear viscosity of the confined
liquids can primarily be determined by the degree of molecular orientation, and
shear-thinning originates from the vanishing of specific orientational
distributions with increasing sliding velocity.

operation of Li-ion batteries. The intercalation of Li-ions into oxides can
further lead to emergent electronic property changes. Some of the fastest
Li-ion conductors are 4d oxides, and of these, the niobium oxide polymorph
T-Nb2O5 is especially interesting with its two-dimensional fast ion migration
channels. However, the growth of single-crystalline T-Nb2O5 films is
challenging due to its stability over only a limited synthesis temperature
window, the existence of many other polymorphs, and its large orthorhombic unit
cell. Here, we first demonstrate the epitaxial growth of single domain T-Nb2O5
thin films, critically with the ion channels oriented perpendicular to the
film's surface. We show that the insertion of just a small amount of Li using
ionic liquids results in conversion of the initially insulating film to a
metallic state with a colossal change in resistivity of almost eleven orders of
magnitude. In situ experiments, in conjunction with theoretical calculations,
reveal a series of transitions between distinct crystal and electronic
structures as the lithium content is systematically increased. These include
hidden phases that have not previously been identified. Furthermore, replacing
the Au electrode with a Li-oxide electrode allows for a significant reduction
of the gate voltage at which metallization takes place. Our study opens a new

remnant (SNR) HB9 (G160.9+2.6) from the \textit{Fermi}-LAT 12-year observations
to quantify the evolution of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in the SNR. In
the vicinity of HB9, there are molecular clouds whose locations do not coincide
with the SNR shell in the line of sight. We detect significant gamma-ray
emissions above 1~GeV spatially coinciding with the two prominent cloud
regions, as well as a emission from the SNR shell, the latter of which is
consistent with the results of previous studies. The energy spectrum above
1~GeV in each region is fitted with a simple power-law function of $dN/dE
\propto E^{-\Gamma}$. The fitting result indicates harder spectra with
power-law indices of $\Gamma$ = $1.84 \pm 0.18$ and $1.84 \pm 0.14$ than that
at the SNR shell with $\Gamma$= $2.55 \pm 0.10$. The observed spectra from the
cloud regions are found to be consistent with the theoretically expected
gamma-ray emissions originating in the protons that escaped from SNR HB9, where
particles can be accelerated up to higher energies than those at the shell at
present. The resultant diffusion coefficient in the vicinity of the SNR is
comparable to that of the Galactic mean.

that arises due to system-environment interactions. While it is very well known
that quantum error correction (QEC) provides a way to protect against errors
that arise due to the noise affecting the system, a perfect quantum code
requires atleast five physical qubits to observe a noticeable improvement over
the no-QEC scenario. However, in cases where the noise structure in the system
is already known, it might be more useful to consider quantum codes that are
adapted to specific noise models. It is already known in the literature that
such codes are resource efficient and perform on par with the standard codes.
In this spirit, we address the following questions concerning such adaptive
quantum codes in this thesis. (a) Construction: Given a noise model, we propose
a simple and fast numerical optimization algorithm to search for good quantum
codes. (b) Application: As a simple application of noise-adapted codes, we
propose an adaptive QEC protocol that allows transmission of quantum
information from one site to the other over a 1-d spin chain with high
fidelity. (c) Fault-tolerance: Finally, we address the question of whether such
noise-adapted QEC protocols can be made fault-tolerant starting with a [[4,1]]

channel attack that exploits the time difference in detector responses used to
obtain key bits. The recommended solution against this timing side channel
attack is to use a large time bin width instead of high resolution timing
information. Common notion is that using a large bin width reduces the
resolution of detector responses, hence supposedly minimizes the information
leakage to an eavesdropper. We challenge this conventional wisdom, and
demonstrate that increasing the bin width does not monotonically reduce the
mutual information between the key bits and the eavesdropper's observation of
detector responses. Instead of randomly increasing the bin width, it should be
carefully chosen because the mutual information fluctuates with respect to the
bin width. We also examined the effect of full width half maximums (FWHMs) of
the detectors responses on the mutual information and showed that decreasing
the FWHM increases the mutual information. Lastly, the start time of binning is
also shown to be important in binning process and the mutual information
fluctuates periodically with respect to it.

intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Parameterized quantum circuit (PQC)
is such the method, and its current design just can handle linear data
classification. However, data in the real world often shows a topological
structure. In the machine learning field, the classical graph convolutional
layer (GCL)-based graph convolutional network (GCN) can well handle the
topological data. Inspired by the architecture of a classical GCN, in this
paper, to expand the function of the PQC, we design a novel PQC architecture to
realize a quantum GCN (QGCN). More specifically, we first implement an adjacent
matrix based on linear combination unitary and a weight matrix in a quantum
GCL, and then by stacking multiple GCLs, we obtain the QGCN. In addition, we
first achieve gradients decent on quantum circuit following the parameter-shift
rule for a GCL and then for the QGCN. We evaluate the performance of the QGCN
by conducting a node classification task on Cora dataset with topological data.
The numerical simulation result shows that QGCN has the same performance as its
classical counterpart, the GCN, in contrast, requires less tunable parameters.
Compared to a traditional PQC, we also verify that deploying an extra adjacent
matrix can significantly improve the classification performance for quantum
topological data.

various species share similar visual appearances, resulting in
misclassification if merely based on visual clues. Therefore, it is helpful to
leverage additional information, e.g., the locations and dates for data
shooting, which can be easily accessible but rarely exploited. In this paper,
we first demonstrate that existing multimodal methods fuse multiple features
only on a single dimension, which essentially has insufficient help in feature
discrimination. To fully explore the potential of multimodal information, we
propose a dynamic MLP on top of the image representation, which interacts with
multimodal features at a higher and broader dimension. The dynamic MLP is an
efficient structure parameterized by the learned embeddings of variable
locations and dates. It can be regarded as an adaptive nonlinear projection for
generating more discriminative image representations in visual tasks. To our
best knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore the idea of dynamic networks
to exploit multimodal information in fine-grained image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The t-SNE
algorithm visually indicates that our technique improves the recognizability of
image representations that are visually similar but with different categories.

subject to phase segregation is analyzed. A single protein, two RNA species,
and two complexes are considered. Protein and RNA species are governed by
coupled reaction-diffusion equations which also depend on the two complexes.
The latter ones are driven by two Cahn-Hilliard equations with Flory-Huggins
potential and reaction terms depending on the solution variables. The resulting
nonlinear coupled system is equipped with no-flux boundary conditions and
suitable initial conditions. The former ones entail some mass conservation
constraints which are also due to the nature of the reaction terms. The
existence of global weak solutions in a bounded (two- or) three-dimensional
domain is established. In dimension two, some weighted-in-time regularity
properties are shown. In particular, the complexes instantaneously get
uniformly separated from the pure phases. Taking advantage of this result, a
unique continuation property is proven. Among the many technical difficulties,
the most significant one arises from the fact that the two complexes are
initially nonexistent, so their initial conditions are zero i.e., they start
from a pure phase. Thus we must solve, in particular, a system of two coupled
Cahn-Hilliard equations with singular potential and nonlinear sources without
the usual assumption on the initial datum, i.e., the initial phase cannot be
pure. This novelty requires a new approach to estimate the chemical potential
in a suitable $L^p(L^2)$-space with $p\in(1,2)$. This technique can be extended
to other models like, for instance, the well-known Cahn-Hilliard-Oono equation.

the two output ports of the interferometer by selectively imparting 30 Bloch
oscillations to one of them before their detection via time of flight. This
method allows increasing the duration of the interferometer by reducing the
time for discriminating the ports of the interferometer at detection. We study
in detail the impact of this separator on the performance of a dual gravity
sensor, and in particular on its measurement sensitivities to gravity
acceleration and gravity gradients.

formation stem from atomistic simulations of simple model systems, especially
ternary mixtures consisting of saturated and unsaturated lipids, and
cholesterol (Chol). To explore the properties of such systems at large spatial
scales, we here present a simple ternary mixture lattice model, involving a
small number of nearest neighbor interaction terms. Monte Carlo simulations of
mixtures with different compositions show an excellent agreement with
experimental and atomistic simulation observations across multiple scale,
ranging from the local distributions of lipids to the phase diagram of the
system. The simplicity of the model allows us to identify the roles played by
the different interactions between components, and the interplay between them.
Importantly, by changing the value of one of the model parameters, we can tune
the size of the liquid-ordered domains, thereby to simulate both Type II
mixtures exhibiting macroscopic phase separation and Type I mixtures with
nanoscopic domains. The Type II mixture simulation results fit well to the
experimentally-determined phase diagram of mixtures containing saturated
DPPC/unsaturated DOPC/Chol. When the tunable parameter is changed, we obtain
the Type I version of DPPC/DOPC/Chol, i.e., a mixture not showing thermodynamic
phase transitions but one that may be fitted to the same phase diagram if local
measures are used to distinguish between the different states. Our model
results suggest that short range packing is likely to be a key regulator of the
stability and size distribution of biological rafts.

evolution equations for the macroscopic order parameters and eventually derive
pitchfork and Hopf bifurcation curves. Transition from the incoherent state to
standing wave pattern is observed in the presence of the unimodal frequency
distribution. In contrast, a rich variety of dynamical states such as the
incoherent state, partially synchronized state-I, partially synchronized
state-II, and standing wave patterns and transitions among them are observed in
the phase diagram, via various bifurcation scenarios including saddle-node and
homoclinic bifurcations, in the presence of bimodal frequency distribution.
Higher order coupling enhances the spread of the bistable regions in the phase
diagrams and also leads to the manifestation of bistability between incoherent
and partially synchronized states even with unimodal frequency distribution,
which is otherwise not observed with the pairwise coupling. Further, the
asymmetry parameters facilitate the onset of several bistable and multistable
regions in the phase diagrams. Very large values of the asymmetry parameters
allow the phase diagrams to admit only the monostable dynamical states.

N(>logM)\propto M^a, we measured a=-0.95\pm0.04, compared to the canonical
a=-1.35 Salpeter IMF slope. The slope of the CMF is robust with respect to map

how cores transfer their mass to stars and sub-fragment to predict the IMF
resulting from the W43-MM2-MM3 CMF. In stark contrast to the commonly accepted
paradigm, our result argues against the universality of the CMF shape. More
robust functions of the star-formation efficiency and core sub-fragmentation
are required to better predict the resulting IMF, here suggested to remain
top-heavy at the end of the star-formation phase. If confirmed, the IMFs
emerging from starburst events could inherit their top-heavy shape from their
parental CMFs, challenging the IMF universality.

successful in probing regions of parameter space which are as of now unexplored
by any experiment. In addition, for models where the vector boson couples
sub-dominantly to the electron and quarks as compared to muons, e.g. in the

compatible with the anomalous magnetic moment of muon. We discuss these results

of variables and the associated non-linearities of neural models, which are

driving, security and safety, medicine and health, the lack of interpretability
of the network behavior tends to induce skepticism and limited trustworthiness,

Furthermore, a single metric, such as the classification accuracy, provides a
non-exhaustive evaluation of most real-world scenarios. In this paper, we want
to make a step forward towards interpretability in neural networks, providing
new tools to interpret their behavior. We present Agglomerator, a framework

with a point gap on the complex energy plane, has attracted great theoretical
and experimental interest. Much less is studied on the so-called second-order
non-Hermitian skin effect, where the bulk does not support a point gap but
localization at the corner still occurs. This work discovers a class of hybrid
skin-topological modes as the second-order non-Hermitian skin effect without
asymmetric couplings. Specifically, by only adding gain/loss to two-dimensional
Chern insulators and so long as the gain/loss strength does not close the line
gap, all the topological edge states are localized at one corner under the open
boundary condition, with the bulk states extended. The resultant non-Hermitian
Chern bands can be still topologically characterized by Chern numbers, whereas
the hybrid skin-topological modes are understood via some auxiliary Hermitian
systems that belong to either intrinsic or extrinsic second-order topological
insulator phases. By proposing an innovative construction of auxiliary
Hamiltonian, our generic route to hybrid skin-topological modes is further
successfully extended to nonequilibrium topological systems with gain and loss,
where the anomalous Floquet band topology is no longer captured by band Chern
numbers. The extension thus leads to the intriguing finding of nonequilibrium
hybrid skin-topological modes. In addition to offering a straightforward route
to experimental realization of hybrid topological-skin effects, this study also
opens up a promising perspective for the understanding of corner localization
by revealing the synergy of three important concepts, namely, non-Hermitian
topological insulator, second-order non-Hermitian skin effect, and second-order
topological insulator.

  Submitted draft",,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Algebraic effect handlers is a programming paradigm where programmers can
declare their own syntactic operations, and modularly define the semantics of
these using effect handlers.
  However, we cannot directly define algebraic effect handlers for many
higher-order operations (or higher-order effects) -- i.e., operations that have
computations as parameters.
  Examples of such higher-order effects include common programming features,
such as try-catch exception handlers, function abstraction, and more.
  In this paper we present a new kind of effect handler that addresses this
shortcoming.
  Our effect handler approach is closely related to previous work on scoped
effect handlers, which also supports higher-order effects.
  A key difference is that our effect handlers make it easy to understand
separate (higher-order) effects as separate concerns, since effects do not
interact.
  In contrast, effect interaction is the default with scoped effect handlers.
  While separate concerns is the default with our handlers, it is also possible
to define handlers where effects interact.

particular, when a nontrivial EM crystal is in contact with its trivial
counterpart, a topologically protected interface state is formed. While much
attention has been focused on single interface state, multiple interface states
can interact collectively when under suitable conditions, giving rise to
trivial or nontrivial band topologies resembling to the standard SSH model.
Here, we study the topological properties of 1D metallic superlattices that
support multiple interface states. We first demonstrate single interface state
exists at the boundary between two topologically distinct metallic arrays that
carry Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons. Such interface state is then used
as the building block for further constructing the superlattices. By exploiting
the separation between two dimerized interface states and the distinct inter-
and intra-interface configurations to facilitate different intracell and
intercell interactions, we vary the band topology of the superlattices. More
importantly, new superlattice interface state is formed when trivial and
nontrivial superlattices are brought together. The superlattice interface state
is found to have smaller angular divergence and longer localization length than
its single counterpart, thus is desired for robust signal transmission and high
finesse cavity.

However, their recall rate is often low as only the visible faces are included

produce pseudo-labels visually. The ""student"" network is an audio network

independently localize the speaker in the visual frames directly from the audio

assignment from the perspective of conventional multistep reinforcement
learning. We show how e.g., a 1-step `hierarchical backup' can be seen as a
conventional multistep backup with $n$ skip connections over time connecting
each subsequent state to the first independent of actions inbetween.
Furthermore, we find that generalizing hierarchy to multistep return estimation
methods requires us to consider how to partition the environment trace, in
order to construct backup paths. We leverage these insight to develop a new
hierarchical algorithm Hier$Q_k(\lambda)$, for which we demonstrate that
hierarchical credit assignment alone can already boost agent performance (i.e.,
when eliminating generalization or exploration). Altogether, our work yields
fundamental insight into the nature of hierarchical backups and distinguishes

curvature-matter coupling between an arbitrary function of the scalar curvature

a non-vanishing covariant derivative of the energy-momentum tensor, that
implies non-geodesic motion and consequently leads to the appearance of an
extra force. Here, we explore the physical and cosmological implications of the
nonconservation of the energy-momentum tensor by using the formalism of
irreversible thermodynamics of open systems in the presence of matter
creation/annihilation. The particle creation rates, pressure, and the
expression of the comoving entropy are obtained in a covariant formulation and
discussed in detail. Applied together with the gravitational field equations,
the thermodynamics of open systems lead to a generalization of the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm, in which the particle creation rates and
pressures are effectively considered as components of the cosmological fluid
energy-momentum tensor. Furthermore, we also briefly present the coupling of
curvature to geometry in conformal quadratic Weyl gravity, by assuming a
coupling term of the form $L_m\tilde{R}^2$, where $L_m$ is the ordinary matter
Lagrangian, and $\tilde{R}$ is the Weyl scalar. The coupling explicitly
satisfies the requirement of the conformal invariance of the theory. Expressing
$\tilde{R}^2$ with the use of an auxiliary scalar field and of the Weyl scalar,
the gravitational action can be linearized in the Ricci scalar, leading in the
Riemann space to a conformally invariant $f\left(R,L_m\right)$ type theory,

interactions in a Dicke model with driven biased term. The nonlinearity of
spectrum, which can be induced by qubit-resonator interactions, plays an
important role in such controllable interactions. To gain insight into
mechanism of the nonlinearity, we perform a unitary transformation to the
Hamiltonian. The results show that the nonlinearity of the transformed
Hamiltonian depends on the qubit-resonator coupling strength. The general forms
of the effective Hamiltonians are discussed in detail based on the frequency
modulation approach. The dynamical evolution can be switched on and off by
adjusting the modulation parameters. By utilizing such controllable
interactions, we discuss the creation of Dicke states and arbitrary
superposition of Dicke states. We also consider the nonlinearity of energy
level for the limit of large qubit numbers. In the thermodynamics limit, the
kerr type nonlinearity is induced from ""magnon""-resonator coupling, and the
selective preparation of ""magnon"" Fock states can be studied under ""magnon""
scenario.

invariant to label-preserving transformations. Usually this invariance is only
encouraged implicitly by including a single augmented input during training.
However, several works have recently shown that using multiple augmentations
per input can improve generalisation or can be used to incorporate invariances
more explicitly. In this work, we first empirically compare these recently
proposed objectives that differ in whether they rely on explicit or implicit
regularisation and at what level of the predictor they encode the invariances.
We show that the predictions of the best performing method are also the most
similar when compared on different augmentations of the same input. Inspired by
this observation, we propose an explicit regulariser that encourages this
invariance on the level of individual model predictions. Through extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet we show that this explicit regulariser
(i) improves generalisation and (ii) equalises performance differences between
all considered objectives. Our results suggest that objectives that encourage
invariance on the level of the neural network itself generalise better than
those that achieve invariance by averaging predictions of non-invariant models.

Because of this magnetic field, a symmetry of translation in the extra
dimensions is broken which implies the existence of a massless scalar boson. We
then explicitly check that a model with two U(1) gauge symmetries contains a
scalar boson with finite mass but protected from large quantum corrections.
Finally, we study the presence of tachyons in the model with non-abelian gauge

metallicities could be measured for 65 targets using the N2 and O3N2 strong
emission line method. The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the
environment metallicities of Type Ib and Ic SNe tend to higher metallicity than
Type IIP, however Type Ic are also present at lower metallicities whereas Type
Ib are not. The Type Ib frequency distribution is narrower (standard deviation
$\sim$0.06 dex) than the Ic and IIP distributions ($\sim$0.15 dex) giving some
evidence for a significant fraction of single massive progenitor stars; the low
metallicity of Type Ic suggests a significant fraction of compact binary
progenitors. However, both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Anderson-Darling
test indicate no statistical significance for a difference in the local
metallicities of the three SN types. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal a strong
sensitivity of these tests to the uncertainties of the derived metallicities.
Given the uncertainties of the strong emission methods, the applicability of
the tests seems limited. We extended our analysis with the data of the Type
Ib/Ic/IIP SN sample from Galbany et al. (2018). The CDFs created with their
sample confirm our CDFs very well. The statistical tests, combining our sample

strongly correlates with core dust temperature, and $M/L$ strongly correlates
with $M/T$, which is in line with the prediction of the blackbody radiation,
and can be used to trace evolutionary sequence from unbound starless cores to
robust prestellar cores. Crest column densities of the filamentary structures
are clearly related with mass per unit length ($M_{\rm line}$), but are
uncorrelated by three orders ranging from $\sim 10^{20}$ to $\sim 10^{22}$ $

of 0.15 pc, which is consistent with the 0.1 pc typical inner width of the

robust prestellar cores (135/199) embedded in supercritical filaments with
$M_{\rm line}>16~M_{\odot}/{\rm pc}$, which implies that the gravitationally
bound cores come from fragmentation of supercritical filaments. And on the
basis of observational evidences that probability distribution function (PDF)
with power-law distribution in the Perseus south is flatter than north, YSO
number is significantly less than that in the north, and dust temperature
difference. We infer that south region is more gravitationally bound than north

previously learned skills and learn from scratch. We address this issue by
introducing SkillNet-NLU, a general-purpose model that stitches together
existing skills to learn new tasks more effectively. The key feature of our
approach is that it is sparsely activated guided by predefined skills.
Different from traditional dense models that always activate all the model
parameters, SkillNet-NLU only activates parts of the model parameters whose
skills are relevant to the target task. When learning for a new task, our
approach precisely activates required skills and also provides an option to add
new skills. We evaluate on natural language understandings tasks and have the
following findings. First, with only one model checkpoint, SkillNet-NLU
performs better than task-specific fine-tuning and two multi-task learning
baselines (i.e., dense model and Mixture-of-Experts model) on six tasks.
Second, sparsely activated pre-training further improves the overall
performance. Third, SkillNet-NLU significantly outperforms baseline systems
when being extended to new tasks.

About 30 optical and near-infrared spectra ($\Re$ $\sim$ 1500-2000) were
collected between 2014-2019 with the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). From the
spectral analysis we have derived the accretion luminosity and mass accretion
rate, the visual extinction, the temperature and density of the permitted line
formation region, and the signature of the outflowing matter.
  Two sources (ASASSN-13db and iPTF15afq) have been observed in outburst and
quiescence, three during a high-level of brightness (XZ Tau, PV Cep, and NY
Ori), and the others in quiescence. These latter have accretion luminosity and
mass accretion rates in line with the values measured in classical T Tauri
stars of similar mass. All sources observed more than once present accretion
variability. The most extreme case is ASASSN-13db, for which the mass accretion
rate decreases by two orders of magnitude from the outburst peak in 2015 to
quiescence in 2017. Also, in NY Ori the accretion luminosity decreases by a
factor 25 in one year. In 80% of the sample we detect the [OI]630 nm line, a
tracer of mass loss. From the variability of the H$\alpha$/[OI]630, ratio, we
conclude that mass accretion variations are larger than mass loss variations.
From the analysis of the HI recombination lines a correlation is suggested
between the density of the line formation region and the level of accretion
activity of the source.

Meanwhile, it is shown that the multi-scale adversary can make a finer

the Byzantine protocols, especially when a small portion of the low-layer
small-scale protocols are allowed to fail arbitrarily. With this, efficient
Byzantine protocols can be built in large sparse networks with high system

dominant features by scale-space decomposition and assessing feature attributes
by estimating covariance function parameters of the underlying processes and
their associations to potential drivers. We analyze Finnish forest inventory

identify the scales of variation in basal area estimates of most common Finnish
trees, including Scots pine, Norway spruce, birch, and other native deciduous
trees. Comparing the resulting scale-dependent features and their attributes in
these tree species, we identify the different effects of edaphic and
anthropogenic drivers on the spatial distribution of their basal areas. These
data are analyzed for the first time in terms of their scale of variation, and
the resulting scale-dependent maps and estimates are an essential contribution
to the historical forest ecology of Fennoscandia. Until now, this analysis was
not possible with conventional methods.

of the critical challenges of time series renewable energy forecasting is the

develops a BiLO-Auto-TSF/ML framework that automates the optimal design of a

Specifically, the lower-level meta-learning helps boost the base-learner to
mitigate the small data challenge while the hyperparameter optimization at the

have made systematic investigation of the phase diagram of the classical and
quantum $J_{1}-J_{3}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model defined on the Kagome
lattice(KAFHM). While it is shown previously that a large antiferromagnetic
exchange between the third-neighboring spins can drive an emergent $q=4$ Potts
order through the order-by-disorder mechanism, it is elusive what will happen
in the so called ""grey region"" where the Luttinger-Tisza criteria fails to
predict the classical ordering pattern. Through extensive Monte Carlo
simulation, we find that the ""grey region"" is characterized by competing
emergent $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts order, whose emergence are beyond the
description of the conventional order-by-disorder mechanism. Our Schwinger
Boson mean field calculation in the ""grey region"" confirms the existence of the
Potts-3 order in the ground state of quantum $J_{1}-J_{3}$ KAFHM. The predicted
Potts-3 state is found to take two different forms distinguished by their
projective symmetry group character(PSG or quantum order), although they have
exactly the same symmetry. A comparison with the exact diagonalization result
on a 36-site cluster shows that the ""grey region"" may indeed host a nematic
spin liquid ground state featuring an anisotropic ring structure around the
$\mathbf{q}=0$ point in its spinon dispersion relation. We find that such ""grey

playground to study the rich competition between exotic emergent phases, rather
than a burden on their theoretical analysis.

minimizing a cost/loss function that is designed to maximize the overlap

experts. A simple loss function based on the degrees of overlap (i.e., Dice
metric) would not take into account the underlying shape and morphology of the
target subject, as well as its realistic/natural variations; therefore,
suboptimal segmentation results would be observed in the form of islands of
voxels, holes, and unrealistic shapes or deformations. In this light, many
studies have been conducted to refine/post-process the segmentation outcome and
consider an initial guess as prior knowledge to avoid outliers and/or
unrealistic estimations. In this study, a novel shape-based cost function is
proposed which encourages/constrains the network to learn/capture the

  the FP32 theoretical peak performance",,,"10.1177/10943420221090256",,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tensor Core is a mixed-precision matrix-matrix multiplication unit on NVIDIA
GPUs with a theoretical peak performance of more than 300 TFlop/s on Ampere
architectures. Tensor Cores were developed in response to the high demand of
dense matrix multiplication from machine learning. However, many applications
in scientific computing such as preconditioners for iterative solvers and
low-precision Fourier transforms can exploit these Tensor Cores. To compute a
matrix multiplication on Tensor Cores, we need to convert input matrices to
half-precision, which results in loss of accuracy. To avoid this, we can keep
the mantissa loss in the conversion using additional half-precision variables
and use them for correcting the accuracy of matrix-matrix multiplication. Even
with this correction, the use of Tensor Cores yields higher throughput compared
to FP32 SIMT Cores. Nevertheless, the correcting capability of this method
alone is limited, and the resulting accuracy cannot match that of a matrix
multiplication on FP32 SIMT Cores. We address this problem and develop a high
accuracy, high performance, and low power consumption matrix-matrix
multiplication implementation using Tensor Cores, which exactly matches the
accuracy of FP32 SIMT Cores while achieving superior throughput. The
implementation is based on NVIDIA's CUTLASS. We found that the key to achieving
this accuracy is how to deal with the rounding inside Tensor Cores and
underflow probability during the correction computation. Our implementation
achieves 51TFlop/s for a limited exponent range using FP16 Tensor Cores and
33TFlop/s for full exponent range of FP32 using TF32 Tensor Cores on NVIDIA
A100 GPUs, which outperforms the theoretical FP32 SIMT Core peak performance of
19.5TFlop/s.

proposed method won a data competition organized by Western Power Distribution,

close to) mean-motion resonances (MMRs) and resonant chains. Often, the
published data exhibit very high uncertainties due to the observational
limitations that introduce chaos into the evolution of the system on especially
shorter or longer timescales. We propose a study of the dynamics of such
systems by exploring particular regions in phase space. We exemplify our method
by studying the long-term orbital stability of the three-planet system
Kepler-51 and either favor or constrain its data. It is a dual process which
breaks down in two steps: the computation of the families of periodic orbits in
the 1:2:3 resonant chain and the visualization of the phase space through maps
of dynamical stability. We present novel results for the general four-body
problem. Stable periodic orbits were found only in the low-eccentricity regime.
We demonstrate three possible scenarios safeguarding Kepler-51, each followed
by constraints. Firstly, there are the 2/1 and 3/2 two-body MMRs, in which
$e_b<0.02$, such that these two-body MMRs last for extended time spans.
Secondly, there is the 1:2:3 three-body Laplace-like resonance, in which
$e_c<0.016$ and $e_d<0.006$ are necessary for such a chain to be viable.
Thirdly, there is the combination comprising the 1/1 secondary resonance inside
the 2/1 MMR for the inner pair of planets and an apsidal difference oscillation
for the outer pair of planets in which the observational eccentricities, $e_b$
and $e_c$, are favored as long as $e_d\approx 0$. With the aim to obtain an
optimum deduction of the orbital elements, this study showcases the need for
dynamical analyses based on periodic orbits performed in parallel to the
fitting processes.

attributed to a change in the inductive bias by treating the approximations as
exact and reverse-engineering the corresponding prior. We show that the problem
is more complicated than it appears to be at first glance, because the solution
generally depends on the observation. By reframing the problem in terms of
incompatible conditional distributions we arrive at a natural solution: the

helical phase at low fields to a Skyrmion phase at intermediate fields before
finally entering a polarized phase at high fields. The size of each Skyrmion
spans only two unit cells of the lattice, in contrast to tens to hundreds of
unit cells in most chiral magnets. Furthermore, the Skyrmions are driven not by
chiral interactions but by the interplay between competing exchange
interactions and geometric frustration, just as in Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ . When
itinerant electrons are coupled to the localized moments, they exhibit the
usual Skyrmion-driven topological Hall effect (THE) arising from the real space
Berry curvature of the the Skyrmion texture. The small size of the Skyrmions in
this system yield a strong local Berry curvature that results in an enhanced
THE, which is investigated using a strong coupling approximation between the
spins of the itinerant electrons and the localized moments. Our results will be
crucial in understanding the experiments in Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ and other
members of the same family of metallic frustrated magnets.

classification problems that would require intensive computational resources

classify stars in simulated galaxy clusters after subtracting the member
galaxies. These dynamically different components are interpreted as the
individual properties of the stars in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) and
IntraCluster Light (ICL). We employ matched stellar catalogues (built from the
different dynamical properties of BCG and ICL) of 29 simulated clusters from
the DIANOGA set to train and test the classifier. The input features are
cluster mass, normalized particle cluster-centric distance, and rest-frame
velocity. The model is found to correctly identify most of the stars, while the
larger errors are exhibited at the BCG outskirt, where the differences between
the physical properties of the two components are less obvious. We investigate
the robustness of the classifier to numerical resolution, redshift dependence
(up to $z=1$), and included astrophysical models. We claim that our classifier
provides consistent results in simulations for $z<1$, at different resolution
levels and with significantly different subgrid models. The phase-space
structure is examined to assess whether the general properties of the stellar
components are recovered: (i) the transition radius between BCG-dominated and
ICL-dominated region is identified at $0.04$ \r200; (ii) the BCG outskirt ($>
0.1$ \r200) is significantly affected by uncertainties in the classification
process. In conclusion, this work suggests the importance of employing Machine

diagnostic screening and clinical management.
  Methods In this retrospective observational noninterventional study using
administrative medical claims data from 1,463,089 patients, gradient-boosted
decision trees were trained to detect likely NASH patients from an at-risk
patient population with a history of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
metabolic disorder, or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL). Models were trained to
detect likely NASH in all at-risk patients or in the subset without a prior
NAFL diagnosis (non-NAFL at-risk patients). Models were trained and validated
using retrospective medical claims data and assessed using area under precision
recall and receiver operating characteristic curves (AUPRCs, AUROCs).
  Results The 6-month incidence of NASH in claims data was 1 per 1,437 at-risk
patients and 1 per 2,127 non-NAFL at-risk patients. The model trained to detect
NASH in all at-risk patients had an AUPRC of 0.0107 (95% CI 0.0104 - 0.011) and
an AUROC of 0.84. At 10% recall, model precision was 4.3%, which is 60x above
NASH incidence. The model trained to detect NASH in non-NAFL patients had an
AUPRC of 0.003 (95% CI 0.0029 - 0.0031) and an AUROC of 0.78. At 10% recall,
model precision was 1%, which is 20x above NASH incidence.
  Conclusion The low incidence of NASH in medical claims data corroborates the
pattern of NASH underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Claims-based machine
learning could facilitate the detection of probable NASH patients for
diagnostic testing and disease management.

improvement of existing passage retrieval systems. However, in the Chinese
field, especially for specific domains, passage retrieval systems are still

including E-commerce, Entertainment video and Medical. Each dataset contains
millions of passages and a certain amount of human annotated query-passage

a passage retrieval system built on in-domain annotated dataset can achieve
significant improvement, which indeed demonstrates the necessity of domain

shock acceleration, specifically at shocks in supernova remnants (SNRs). These
shocks expand in a complex environment, particularly in the core-collapse
scenario as these SNRs evolve inside the wind-blown bubbles created by their
progenitor stars. The cosmic rays (CRs) at core-collapse SNRs may carry
spectral signatures of that complexity. Aims. We study particle acceleration in
the core-collapse SNR of a progenitor with initial mass 60 $M_\odot$ and
realistic stellar evolution. The SNR shock interacts with discontinuities
inside the wind-blown bubble and generates several transmitted and reflected
shocks. We analyse their impact on particle spectra and the resulting emission
from the remnant. Methods. The hydrodynamic equations for the evolution of SNR
inside the pre-supernova circumstellar medium have been solved simultaneously
with the transport equation for cosmic rays in test-particle approximation and
with the induction equation for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in 1-D spherical
symmetry. Results. The evolution of core-collapse SNRs inside complex
wind-blown bubbles modifies the spectra of both the particles and their
emission. We have found softer particle spectra with spectral indices close to
2.5 during shock propagation inside the shocked wind, and this softness
persists at later evolutionary stages. Further, our calculated total production
spectrum released into the interstellar medium demonstrates spectral
consistency at high energy with the galactic CRs injection spectrum, required
in propagation models. The magnetic field structure effectively influences the
emission morphology of SNR as it governs the transportation of particles and
the synchrotron emissivity.

transfer skills from humans to robots. Traditionally, LfD has been used to
transfer Cartesian and joint positions and forces from human demonstrations.
The traditional approach works well for some robotic tasks, but for many tasks
of interest it is necessary to learn skills such as orientation, impedance,
and/or manipulability that have specific geometric characteristics. An
effective encoding of such skills can be only achieved if the underlying
geometric structure of the skill manifold is considered and the constrains
arising from this structure are fulfilled during both learning and execution.
However, typical learned skill models such as dynamic movement primitives
(DMPs) are limited to Euclidean data and fail in correctly embedding quantities
with geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel and
mathematically principled framework that uses concepts from Riemannian geometry
to allow DMPs to properly embed geometric constrains. The resulting DMP
formulation can deal with data sampled from any Riemannian manifold including,
but not limited to, unit quaternions and symmetric and positive definite
matrices. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated both on
simulated data and real robot experiments. The performed evaluation
demonstrates that beneficial properties of DMPs, such as convergence to a given
goal and the possibility to change the goal during operation, apply also to the
proposed formulation.

recognition (STR) methods, due to its capability of extracting character-level
representations. These methods can be summarized into implicit attention based
and supervised attention based, depended on how the attention is computed,
i.e., implicit attention and supervised attention are learned from
sequence-level text annotations and or character-level bounding box
annotations, respectively. Implicit attention, as it may extract coarse or even
incorrect spatial regions as character attention, is prone to suffering from an
alignment-drifted issue. Supervised attention can alleviate the above issue,
but it is character category-specific, which requires extra laborious
character-level bounding box annotations and would be memory-intensive when
handling languages with larger character categories. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel attention mechanism for STR,
self-supervised implicit glyph attention (SIGA). SIGA delineates the glyph
structures of text images by jointly self-supervised text segmentation and
implicit attention alignment, which serve as the supervision to improve
attention correctness without extra character-level annotations. Experimental
results demonstrate that SIGA performs consistently and significantly better

  Reconfiguration",,,,,"cs.NI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wireless x-haul networks rely on microwave and millimeter-wave links between
4G and/or 5G base-stations to support ultra-high data rate and ultra-low
latency. A major challenge associated with these high frequency links is their
susceptibility to weather conditions. In particular, precipitation may cause
severe signal attenuation, which significantly degrades the network
performance. In this paper, we develop a Predictive Network Reconfiguration
(PNR) framework that uses historical data to predict the future condition of
each link and then prepares the network ahead of time for imminent
disturbances. The PNR framework has two components: (i) an Attenuation
Prediction (AP) mechanism; and (ii) a Multi-Step Network Reconfiguration (MSNR)
algorithm. The AP mechanism employs an encoder-decoder Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) model to predict the sequence of future attenuation levels of each link.
The MSNR algorithm leverages these predictions to dynamically optimize routing
and admission control decisions aiming to maximize network utilization, while
preserving max-min fairness among the base-stations sharing the network and
preventing transient congestion that may be caused by re-routing. We train,
validate, and evaluate the PNR framework using a dataset containing over 2
million measurements collected from a real-world city-scale backhaul network.
The results show that the framework: (i) predicts attenuation with high
accuracy, with an RMSE of less than 0.4 dB for a prediction horizon of 50
seconds; and (ii) can improve the instantaneous network utilization by more
than 200% when compared to reactive network reconfiguration algorithms that
cannot leverage information about future disturbances.

useful applications is to monitor the proportion of non-conforming products.
However, in practical applications, measurement error is ubiquitous and may
occur due to false records or misclassification, which makes the observed
proportion different from the underlying true proportion. It is also well-known
that ignoring measurement error effects provides biases, and is expected that
the resulting control charts may incur wrong detection. In this paper, we study
this important problem and propose a valid method to correct for measurement
error effects and obtain error-eliminated control chart for the proportion of
non-conforming products. In addition, unlike traditional approaches, the
corrected EWMA $p$-control chart provides asymmetric control limits and is
flexible to handle the data with small sample size. Numerical results are
conducted to justify the validity of the corrected EWMA $p$-control chart and
verify the necessity of measurement error correction.

faint rest-UV emission lines in 12 $z \sim$ 3 radio galaxies from the

(NLRs) in high-$z$ active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been investigated mostly
by using only strong rest-UV emission-lines (e.g., NV$\lambda$1240,
CIV$\lambda$1549, HeII$\lambda$1640, and CIII]$\lambda$1909). Such strong-line
diagnostics are based on various assumptions due to the limitation in the
number of available emission-line constraints. In this work, both physical and
chemical properties of NLR clouds in each object are estimated by fitting
detailed photoionization models to the measured emission-line fluxes. We
confirm that the metallicity of NLRs in AGNs at $z \sim$ 3 is solar or
super-solar, without assuming the gas density and ionization parameter thanks
to the constrains from the faint emission lines. This result suggests that
high-$z$ radio galaxies are already chemically matured at $z \sim$ 3.

rich set of bitonal patterns, or screentones, for illustration. However,
screentones can easily be contaminated with visual-unpleasant aliasing and/or
blurriness after resampling, which harms its visualization on displays of
diverse resolutions. To address this problem, we propose the first manga
retargeting method that synthesizes a rescaled manga image while retaining the
screentone in each screened region. This is a non-trivial task as accurate
region-wise segmentation remains challenging. Fortunately, the rescaled manga
shares the same region-wise screentone correspondences with the original manga,
which enables us to simplify the screentone synthesis problem as an
anchor-based proposals selection and rearrangement problem. Specifically, we
design a novel manga sampling strategy to generate aliasing-free screentone
proposals, based on hierarchical grid-based anchors that connect the
correspondences between the original and the target rescaled manga.
Furthermore, a Recurrent Proposal Selection Module (RPSM) is proposed to
adaptively integrate these proposals for target screentone synthesis. Besides,
to deal with the translation insensitivity nature of screentones, we propose a
translation-invariant screentone loss to facilitate the training convergence.

find that observational bounds are competitive with theoretical ones and
together they exclude a significant portion of the model's parameter space. We
argue that the parameter space still remains large and interesting for future

interiors. Analytical descriptions of the global oscillation modes, in
combination with pulsation codes, have provided valuable help in processing and
interpreting the large amount of seismic data collected by the CoRoT, $Kepler$,
and TESS missions. These prior results have paved the way to more in-depth
analyses of the oscillation spectra of stars, which requires innovative
theoretical descriptions of stellar oscillations. In this paper, we aim to
analytically express the resonance condition of the spheroidal adiabatic
oscillation modes in a very general way, applicable at different evolutionary
stages. In the present formulation, a star is represented as an acoustic
interferometer composed of a multitude of resonant cavities where waves can
propagate and the short-wavelength JWKB approximation is met. Each cavity is
separated from the adjacent ones by barriers, which corresponds to regions
either where waves are evanescent or where the JWKB approximation fails. The
stationary modes are computed using two different physical representations: 1)
the infinite-time reflections picture 2) the linear boundary value problem
picture. Both provide the same resonance condition, which ultimately turns out
to depend on a number of parameters: the reflection and transmission phase lags
introduced by each barrier, the coupling factor associated with each barrier,
and the wave number integral over each resonant cavity. Using such a
formulation, we can retrieve the usual forms derived in previous works (e.g.,
mixed modes with two or three cavities, low- and large-amplitude glitches).
This resonance condition provides a new tool that is useful in predicting the
stellar oscillation spectra and interpret seismic observations at different
evolutionary stages. Practical applications are left to future work.

over the use of its generated income. Gaka-chu (""painter"" in Japanese) is a
6-axis robot arm that creates paintings of Japanese characters from an
autoselected keyword. By using a blockchain-based smart contract, Gaka-chu can
autonomously list a painting it made for sale in an online auction. In this
transaction, the robot interacts with the human bidders as a peer not as a
tool. Using the blockchain-based smart contract, Gaka-chu can then use its
income from selling paintings to replenish its resources by autonomously
ordering materials from an online art shop. We built the Gaka-chu prototype
with an Ethereum-based smart contract and ran a 6-month long experiment, during
which the robot created and sold four paintings, simultaneously using its
income to purchase supplies and repay initial investors. In this work, we
present the results of the experiments conducted and discuss the implications
of economically autonomous robots.

temperatures of 140 K and 170 K for VLA4A and VLA4B, respectively. For the
other species the column densities are derived from a LTE analysis. Formamide,
which is the only N-bearing species detected in our observations, is more
prominent around VLA4A, while dimethyl ether, methanol and acetaldehyde are
associated with both VLA4A and VLA4B. We derive in the two hot corinos
abundance ratios of $\sim$ 1 for CH$_{\rm 3}$OH, $^{13}$CH$_{\rm 3}$OH, and
CH$_{\rm 3}$OCH$_{\rm 3}$, $\sim$ 2 for CH$_{\rm 3}$CHO, and $\sim$ 4 for

the different species inside the binary system. The emerging picture is that of
an onion-like structure of the two SVS13-A hot corinos, caused by the different
binding energies of the species, also supported by ad hoc quantum chemistry
calculations. In addition, the comparison between molecular and dust maps
suggests that the interstellar complex organic molecules emission originates
from slow shocks produced by accretion streamers impacting the VLA4A and VLA4B

Here, the novel combination of learning from off-line convex optimisations on

signals increases stability and performance at scale. Using fixed-size

objectives without sharing personal data either with each other or with a

to trade-off accuracy and computational efficiency gradually via offering on
one extreme inference of a potentially fully-connected graph or on another

all pair-wise interactions among time-series which yields the best forecasting

inter-communicating the N time series through a small set of K auxiliary nodes

  Semiring Semantics",,,,,"cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semiring semantics evaluates logical statements by values in some commutative
semiring K. Random semiring interpretations, induced by a probability
distribution on K, generalise random structures, and we investigate here the
question of how classical results on first-order logic on random structures,
most importantly the 0-1 laws of Glebskii et al. and Fagin, generalise to
semiring semantics. For positive semirings, the classical 0-1 law implies that
every first-order sentence is, asymptotically, either almost surely evaluated
to 0 by random semiring interpretations, or almost surely takes only values
different from 0. However, by means of a more sophisticated analysis, based on
appropriate extension properties and on algebraic representations of
first-order formulae, we can prove much stronger results.
  For many semirings K, the first-order sentences can be partitioned into
classes F(j) for all semiring values j in K, such that every sentence in F(j)
evaluates almost surely to j under random semiring interpretations. Further,
for finite or infinite lattice semirings, this partition actually collapses to
just three classes F(0), F(1), and F(e), of sentences that, respectively,
almost surely evaluate to 0, 1, and to the smallest non-zero value e. The
problem of computing the almost sure valuation of a first-order sentence on
finite lattice semirings is PSPACE-complete.
  An important semiring where the analysis is somewhat different is the
semiring of natural numbers. Here, both addition and multiplication are
increasing with respect to the natural semiring order and the classes F(j), for
natural numbers j, no longer cover all FO-sentences, but have to be extended by
the class of sentences that almost surely evaluate to unboundedly large values.

Chamber (TPC) which is equipped with Micropattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD)
readout modules. The LCTPC collaboration was founded in 2007 to design such a
MPGD-based TPC and to build and test demonstrator modules. For this an
experimental setup at DESY, Hamburg, was built, where four different readout
concepts have been studied in many successful test beam campaigns since 2010.
It could be demonstrated that the required transverse and longitudinal space
point resolutions can be reached. Also, a new gating concept was developed that
can effectively eliminate the ion backflow, while marginally degrading the
performance of the detector.

the characteristic of the recording environment. In this regard, deep learning
based approaches have emerged as a useful tool for ASC problems. Conventional
approaches to improving the classification accuracy include integrating
auxiliary methods such as attention mechanism, pre-trained models and ensemble
multiple sub-networks. However, due to the complexity of audio clips captured
from different environments, it is difficult to distinguish their categories
without using any auxiliary methods for existing deep learning models using
only a single classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for ASC
using deep neural decision forest (DNDF). DNDF combines a fixed number of
convolutional layers and a decision forest as the final classifier. The
decision forest consists of a fixed number of decision tree classifiers, which
have been shown to offer better classification performance than a single
classifier in some datasets. In particular, the decision forest differs
substantially from traditional random forests as it is stochastic,
differentiable, and capable of using the back-propagation to update and learn
feature representations in neural network. Experimental results on the
DCASE2019 and ESC-50 datasets demonstrate that our proposed DNDF method
improves the ASC performance in terms of classification accuracy and shows
competitive performance as compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

pre-trained on large corpora to predict attributes from unstructured data, such

the VC dimension or Rademacher complexity, are so far unsuitable for deep
models and it is doubtful that these techniques can yield tight bounds even in
the most idealistic settings (Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019). In this work, we
instead revisit the concept of leave-one-out (LOO) error to measure the
generalization ability of deep models in the so-called kernel regime. While
popular in statistics, the LOO error has been largely overlooked in the context
of deep learning. By building upon the recently established connection between

the leave-one-out error, giving us access to an efficient proxy for the test

is capable of capturing various phenomena in generalization theory, such as
double descent, random labels or transfer learning. Our work therefore
demonstrates that the leave-one-out error provides a tractable way to estimate
the generalization ability of deep neural networks in the kernel regime,
opening the door to potential, new research directions in the field of
generalization.

approach for time series feature extraction using a large number of independent
randomly initialized 1-D convolution kernels of different configurations. The
output of the convolution operation on each time series is represented by a
partial positive value (PPV). A concatenation of PPVs from all kernels is the
input feature vector to a Ridge regression classifier. Unlike typical deep
learning models, the kernels are not trained and there is no weighted/trainable
connection between kernels or concatenated features and the classifier. Since
these kernels are generated randomly, a portion of these kernels may not
positively contribute in performance of the model. Hence, selection of the most
important kernels and pruning the redundant and less important ones is
necessary to reduce computational complexity and accelerate inference of Rocket
for applications on the edge devices. Selection of these kernels is a
combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a scheme for
selecting these kernels while maintaining the classification performance.
First, the original model is pre-trained at full capacity. Then, a population
of binary candidate state vectors is initialized where each element of a vector
represents the active/inactive status of a kernel. A population-based
optimization algorithm evolves the population in order to find a best state
vector which minimizes the number of active kernels while maximizing the
accuracy of the classifier. This activation function is a linear combination of
the total number of active kernels and the classification accuracy of the
pre-trained classifier with the active kernels. Finally, the selected kernels
in the best state vector are utilized to train the Ridge regression classifier

important in the design of thermal energy storage systems for solar power and
nuclear energy production applications. The high temperatures involved make
their experimental determination problematic, and the development of both
macroscopic thermodynamic correlations and predictive molecular-based
methodologies are complicated by the requirement to appropriately incorporate
the chemically reacting vapor-phase species. We derive a general
thermodynamic-based atomistic simulation framework for molten salt VLE
prediction and show its application to NaCl. Its input quantities are
temperature-dependent ideal-gas free energy data for the vapor phase reactions,
and density and residual chemical potential data for the liquid. If these are
not available experimentally, the former may be predicted using standard
electronic structure software, and the latter by means of classical atomistic
simulation methodology. The framework predicts the temperature dependence of
vapor pressure, coexisting phase densities, vapor phase composition, and
vaporization enthalpy. It also predicts the concentrations of vapor phase
species present in minor amounts (such as the free ions), quantities that are
extremely difficult to measure experimentally. We furthermore use the VLE
results to obtain approximations to the complete VLE binodal dome and the
critical properties. We verify the framework for molten NaCl, for which
experimentally based density and chemical potential data are available in the
literature. We then apply it to the analysis of NaCl simulation data for two
commonly used atomistic force fields. The framework can be readily extended to
molten salt mixtures and to ionic liquids.

parameter for solar wind modelling. Here, we use a time series of tomographical
maps gained from coronagraph observations between 2007 - 2020 to directly
measure the longitudinal drift of high-density streamers over time. The method
reveals abrupt changes in rotation rates, revealing a complex relationship
between the coronal rotation and the underlying photosphere. The majority of
rates are between -1.0 to +0.5$^\circ$/day relative to the standard Carrington
rate of 14.18$^\circ$/day, although rates are measured as low as
-2.2$^\circ$/day and as high as 1.6$^\circ$/day. Equatorial rotation rates
during the 2008 solar minimum are slightly faster than the Carrington rate,
with an abrupt switch to slow rotation in 2009, then a return to faster rates
in 2017. Abrupt changes and large variations in rates are seen at all
latitudes. Comparison with a magnetic model suggests that periods of equatorial
fast rotation are associated with times when a large proportion of the magnetic
footpoints of equatorial streamers are near the equator, and we interpret the
abrupt changes in terms of the latitudinal distribution of the streamer
photospheric footpoints. The coronal rotation rate is a key parameter for solar
wind models, and variations of up to a degree per day or more can lead to large
systematic errors over forecasting periods of longer than a few days. The
approach described in this paper gives corrected values that can form a part of
future forecasting efforts.

learned model and its metadata, such as sample counts, in estimating the
system's knowledge through the ""knows what it knows"" framework. A novel
algorithm that extends bidirectional learning to multiple fidelities of

effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in which an

Monte Carlo trials compare the sample efficiency of the proposed algorithm to

recent years. Public datasets have enabled benchmarking of algorithms and have
set standards for the cutting edge technology. However, existing datasets are
not representative of the technological landscape, with only a reduced number
of lidars available. This inherently limits the development and comparison of
general-purpose algorithms in the evolving landscape. This paper presents a
novel multi-modal lidar dataset with sensors showcasing different scanning
modalities (spinning and solid-state), sensing technologies, and lidar cameras.
The focus of the dataset is on low-drift odometry, with ground truth data
available in both indoors and outdoors environment with sub-millimeter accuracy
from a motion capture (MOCAP) system. For comparison in longer distances, we
also include data recorded in larger spaces indoors and outdoors. The dataset
contains point cloud data from spinning lidars and solid-state lidars. Also, it
provides range images from high resolution spinning lidars, RGB and depth
images from a lidar camera, and inertial data from built-in IMUs. This is, to
the best of our knowledge, the lidar dataset with the most variety of sensors
and environments where ground truth data is available. This dataset can be
widely used in multiple research areas, such as 3D LiDAR simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), performance comparison between multi-modal
lidars, appearance recognition and loop closure detection. The datasets are
available at: https://github.com/TIERS/tiers-lidars-dataset.

purposes both in and outside healthcare institutions. Among the various imaging
modalities, only a few are readily portable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
the gold standard for numerous healthcare conditions, does not traditionally
belong to this group. Recently, low-field MRI start-up companies have
demonstrated the first decisive steps towards portability within medical
facilities, but these are so far incompatible with more demanding use cases
such as in remote and developing regions, sports facilities and events, medical
and military camps, or home healthcare. Here we present in vivo images taken
with a light, home-made, low-field extremity MRI scanner outside the controlled
environment provided by medical facilities. To demonstrate the true portability
of the system and benchmark its performance in various relevant scenarios, we
have acquired images of a volunteer's knee in: i) an MRI physics laboratory;
ii) an office room; iii) outside a campus building, connected to a nearby power
outlet; iv) in open air, powered from a small fuel-based generator; and v) at
the volunteer's home. All images have been acquired within clinically viable
times, and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and tissue contrast suffice for 2D and
3D reconstructions with diagnostic value, with comparable overall image quality
across all five situations. Furthermore, the volunteer carries a fixation
metallic implant screwed to the femur, which leads to strong artifacts in
standard clinical systems but appears sharp in our low-field acquisitions.
Altogether, this work opens a path towards highly accessible MRI under
circumstances previously unrealistic.

systems via deep neural networks (DNNs), with the goal of conducting long time
prediction of the evolution of the unknown system. Training a DNN with low
generalization error is a particularly important task in this case as error is
accumulated over time. Because of the inherent randomness in DNN training,
chiefly in stochastic optimization, there is uncertainty in the resulting
prediction, and therefore in the generalization error. Hence, the
generalization error can be viewed as a random variable with some probability
distribution. Well-trained DNNs, particularly those with many hyperparameters,
typically result in probability distributions for generalization error with low
bias but high variance. High variance causes variability and unpredictably in
the results of a trained DNN. This paper presents a computational technique
which decreases the variance of the generalization error, thereby improving the
reliability of the DNN model to generalize consistently. In the proposed
ensemble averaging method, multiple models are independently trained and model
predictions are averaged at each time step. A mathematical foundation for the
method is presented, including results regarding the distribution of the local
truncation error. In addition, three time-dependent differential equation
problems are considered as numerical examples, demonstrating the effectiveness
of the method to decrease variance of DNN predictions generally.

We computed the lateral translation that is to be considered for short-range
applications, such as wavefront sensing and meteor trajectories. We aim to
calculate the lateral shift at each altitude and study its variation according
to meteorological conditions and the location of the observation site. We also
pay special attention to the chromatism of this lateral shift. We extracted the
variation equations of refraction from the geometric tracing of a light ray
path. A numerical method and a dry atmosphere model allowed us to numerically
integrate the system of coupled equations. In addition to this, based on Taylor
expansions, we established three analytic approximations of the lateral shift,
one of which is the one already known in the literature. We compared the three
approximations to the numerical solution. All these estimators are included in
a Python 3.2 package, which is available online. Using the numerical
integration estimator, we calculated the lateral shift values for any zenith
angle including low elevations. The shift is typically around 3 m at a zenith
angle of 45{\deg}, 10 m at 65{\deg}, and even 300 m{\deg} at 85{\deg}. Next,
the study of the variability of the lateral shift as a function of wavelength
shows differences of up to 2% between the visible and near infrared. The
analysis of the errors of each approximation shows the ranges of validity of
the three estimators as a function of the zenith angle. The flat Earth
estimator achieves a relative error of less than 1% up to 55{\deg} while the
new extended second-order estimators improves this result up to 75{\deg}. The
flat Earth estimator is sufficient for applications where the zenith angle is
below 55{\deg} but a refined estimator is necessary to estimate meteor
trajectories at low elevations.

information via signals that vary in time. Computing the information
transmission rate or the information encoded in the temporal characteristics of
these signals, requires the mutual information between the input and output
signals as a function of time, i.e. between the input and output trajectories.
Yet, this is notoriously difficult because of the high-dimensional nature of
the trajectory space, and all existing techniques require approximations. We
present an exact Monte Carlo technique called Path Weight Sampling (PWS) that,
for the first time, makes it possible to compute the mutual information between
input and output trajectories for any stochastic system that is described by a
master equation. The principal idea is to use the master equation to evaluate
the exact conditional probability of an individual output trajectory for a
given input trajectory, and average this via Monte Carlo sampling in trajectory
space to obtain the mutual information. We present three variants of PWS, which
all generate the trajectories using the standard stochastic simulation
algorithm. While Direct PWS is a brute-force method, Rosenbluth-Rosenbluth PWS
exploits the analogy between signal trajectory sampling and polymer sampling,
and Thermodynamic Integration PWS is based on a reversible work calculation in
trajectory space. PWS also makes it possible to compute the mutual information
between input and output trajectories for systems with hidden internal states
as well as systems with feedback from output to input. Applying PWS to the
bacterial chemotaxis system, consisting of 173 coupled chemical reactions,
demonstrates not only that the scheme is highly efficient, but also that the
appropriate measure for quantifying information transmission via time-varying
signals is indeed the information transmission rate.

measurement noise floor in applications ranging from wireless communications to
positioning, navigation, and timing to magnetic resonance imaging. We overcome
this barrier in continuously cooling a ${\sim} 3$ GHz cavity mode by coupling
it to an ensemble of optically spin-polarized nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in
a room-temperature diamond. The NV spins are pumped into a low entropy state
via a green laser and act as a heat sink to the microwave mode through their

realization of efficient mode cooling at ambient temperature opens the door to

The training error decays as a power-law with an exponent that varies
continuously and vanishes at a critical threshold, marking the limit of
trainable responses. We study how the transition affects the vibrational
properties. Approaching the critical threshold, low frequency modes

  block particle filtering",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The particle filter (PF) is a powerful inference tool widely used to estimate
the filtering distribution in non-linear and/or non-Gaussian problems. To
overcome the curse of dimensionality of PF, the block PF (BPF) inserts a
blocking step to partition the state space into several subspaces or blocks of
smaller dimension so that the correction and resampling steps can be performed
independently on each subspace. Using blocks of small size reduces the variance
of the filtering distribution estimate, but in turn the correlation between
blocks is broken and a bias is introduced.
  When the dependence relationships between state variables are unknown, it is
not obvious to decide how to split the state space into blocks and a
significant error overhead may arise from a poor choice of partitioning. In
this paper, we formulate the partitioning problem in the BPF as a clustering
problem and we propose a state space partitioning method based on spectral
clustering (SC). We design a generalized BPF algorithm that contains two new
steps: (i) estimation of the state vector correlation matrix from predicted
particles, (ii) SC using this estimate as the similarity matrix to determine an
appropriate partition. In addition, a constraint is imposed on the maximal
cluster size to prevent SC from providing too large blocks. We show that the
proposed method can bring together in the same blocks the most correlated state
variables while successfully escaping the curse of dimensionality.

initial values of original IVP. This is easily solved using the Lie group and
known symbolic or numerical methods without any network parameters (weights and

trained using the error back propagation method by minimizing an error (loss)

learning to a more realistic scenario that aims at recognizing multiple unseen
labels of classes for each input sample. Existing works usually exploit
attention mechanism to generate the correlation among different labels.
However, most of them are usually biased on several major classes while neglect
most of the minor classes with the same importance in input samples, and may
thus result in overly diffused attention maps that cannot sufficiently cover
minor classes. We argue that disregarding the connection between major and
minor classes, i.e., correspond to the global and local information,
respectively, is the cause of the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework of unbiased multi-label zero-shot learning, by considering various
class-specific regions to calibrate the training process of the classifier.
Specifically, Pyramid Feature Attention (PFA) is proposed to build the
correlation between global and local information of samples to balance the
presence of each class. Meanwhile, for the generated semantic representations
of input samples, we propose Semantic Attention (SA) to strengthen the
element-wise correlation among these vectors, which can encourage the
coordinated representation of them. Extensive experiments on the large-scale
multi-label zero-shot benchmarks NUS-WIDE and Open-Image demonstrate that the
proposed method surpasses other representative methods by significant margins.

multicenter retinal images. RVms mainly consists of a style augmentation and
transfer (SAT) module and a dual-teacher knowledge distillation (DTKD) module.
SAT augments and clusters images into source-similar domains and
source-dissimilar domains via Bezier and Fourier transformations. DTKD utilizes
the augmented and transformed data to train two teachers, one for
source-similar domains and the other for source-dissimilar domains. Afterwards,
knowledge distillation is performed to iteratively distill different domain
knowledge from teachers to a generic student. The local relative intensity
transformation is employed to characterize RVs in a domain invariant manner and
promote the generalizability of teachers and student models. Moreover, we
construct a new multimodal and multicenter vascular segmentation dataset from
existing publicly-available datasets, which can be used to benchmark various
domain adaptation and domain generalization methods. Through extensive
experiments, RVms is found to be very close to the target-trained Oracle in

challenging problems in theoretical high-energy physics. An often-used approach
is to describe the gravitational degrees of freedom by the metric tensor or

model, the gravitational degrees of freedom are encoded in a tensorial quantity
$P_{abc}$, and this quantity is subsequently quantised. This makes the
quantisation much more straightforward mathematically, but the interpretation
of this tensor as a spacetime is less evident. In this work we take a first
step towards fully understanding the relationship to spacetime. By considering
$P_{abc}$ as the generator of an algebra of functions, we first describe how we
can recover the topology and the measure of a compact Riemannian manifold.
Using the tensor rank decomposition, we then generalise this principle in order
to have a well-defined notion of the topology and geometry for a large class of
tensors $P_{abc}$. We provide some examples of the emergence of a topology and
measure of both exact and perturbed Riemannian manifolds, and of a purely

framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity say $f(Q)$ gravity in which the

consider a special form of the $f\left( Q\right) $ function which can be cast
as $f\left( Q\right) =\lambda Q^{n}$, where $\lambda $ and $n$ both are the
dynamical model parameters. Such a choice can be viewed as a hybrid scale
factor that leads to a relation between cosmic time and redshift as $% t=\left(
\frac{\alpha t_{0}}{\beta }\right) W\left[ \frac{\beta }{\alpha }e^{%
\frac{\beta -\ln \left( 1+z\right) }{\alpha }}\right] $ which describes a $%
\Lambda $CDM model of the Universe with the expansion evolving from
decelerating to an acceleration phase. The best values for the model parameters
i.e. $\alpha $ and $\beta $ that would accord with the most current
observational datasets are then estimated. We make use of 57 points from the
Hubble dataset, 1048 points from the supernovae of type Ia dataset and 6 points
from the BAO dataset. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique in
conjunction with Bayesian analysis and the likelihood function. Further, we
study the validity of our model with the investigation of the thermodynamical
quantities, energy conditions along with some physical variables such as the
EoS, and jerk parameters. Next, our results are discussed in light of current

extracting discriminative features utilizing not only in-plane semantics but
also out-of-plane coherence for each separate slice. Specifically, we present a

An extension of ClaDec allows trading comprehensibility and fidelity. We
evaluate our approach for image classification using convolutional neural

AEs. This holds although AEs contain more information on the original input.
Our user study highlights that even non-experts can identify a diverse set of

analog voltages by a sensor pixel array, and then converted to the digital
domain for subsequent AI processing using analog-to-digital converters (ADC).
Recent research has tried to take advantage of massively parallel low-power
analog/digital computing in the form of near- and in-sensor processing, in
which the AI computation is performed partly in the periphery of the pixel
array and partly in a separate on-board CPU/accelerator. Unfortunately,
high-resolution input images still need to be streamed between the camera and

processing a MobileNetV2 model on a TinyML use case for visual wake words

multiple shorter sub-sequences and trains the sub-sequences on different

correction of the hidden state to accelerate end-to-end communication in both
the forward and backward propagation phases of gradient descent. Experimental
results on the HMDB51 dataset, where each video is an image sequence,
demonstrate that the new parallel training scheme achieves up to 6.5$\times$

metamaterials absorption in both microwave and acoustic systems, with the focus
on those that pushed the overall performance close to the causal limit. We take
note of some new, emerging metastructures that can circumvent the constraint
imposed by causal limit, thereby opening a new avenue to low-frequency
absorption. This review concludes by discussing the existing challenges with
possible solutions and the broad horizon for future developments.

the Fermat equation with signature $(p,p,2)$ and $(p,p,3)$ using a method
involving modularity, level lowering and image of inertia comparison. These

consider $K$ a totally real field of degree $n$ with $2 \nmid h_K^+$ and $2$

$K$ and satisfies $\gcd(n,q-1)=1$, then we know that the equation $a^p+b^p=c^2$
has no primitive, non-trivial solutions $(a,b,c) \in \mathcal{O}_K^3$ with $2 |

fundamental interactions -- gravity and those mediated by gauge fields. We
explore product spacetimes which a) have the necessary symmetries for gauge
interactions and four-dimensional gravity and b) reduce to an N-dimensional
isotropic universe in their flat space limit. The key technique is looking at
orbits of the operator form of symmetric rank-two tensors under changes of
coordinate system. Orbits containing diagonal matrices are seen to correspond
to product manifolds. The GL(N, R) symmetry of the decompactified universe acts
non-linearly on such a product spacetime.
  We explore the resulting Kaluza-Klein theories, in which the internal
symmetries act indirectly on space of the extra dimensions, and give two
examples: a six-dimensional model in which the gauge symmetry is U (1) and a
seven-dimensional model in which it is SU (2). We identify constraints that can
be placed on any rank-two symmetric tensor to obtain such spacetimes:
relationships between polynomial invariants. The multiplicities of its
eigenvalues determine the dimensionalities of the factor spaces and hence the
gauge symmetries. If the tensor in question is the Ricci tensor, other than
two-dimensional factor spaces all the factor spaces are Einstein manifolds.
This situation represents the classical vacuum of the Kaluza-Klein theory

  for Research Proposals","11 pages with 2 appendix, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The peer merit review of research proposals has been the major mechanism to
decide grant awards. Nowadays, research proposals have become increasingly
interdisciplinary. It has been a longstanding challenge to assign proposals to
appropriate reviewers. One of the critical steps in reviewer assignment is to
generate accurate interdisciplinary topic labels for proposals. Existing
systems mainly collect topic labels manually reported by discipline
investigators. However, such human-reported labels can be non-accurate and
incomplete. What role can AI play in developing a fair and precise proposal
review system? In this evidential study, we collaborate with the National
Science Foundation of China to address the task of automated interdisciplinary
topic path detection. For this purpose, we develop a deep Hierarchical
Interdisciplinary Research Proposal Classification Network (HIRPCN). We first
propose a hierarchical transformer to extract the textual semantic information
of proposals. We then design an interdisciplinary graph and leverage GNNs to
learn representations of each discipline in order to extract interdisciplinary
knowledge. After extracting the semantic and interdisciplinary knowledge, we
design a level-wise prediction component to fuse the two types of knowledge
representations and detect interdisciplinary topic paths for each proposal. We
conduct extensive experiments and expert evaluations on three real-world
datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

vulnerabilities, their importance in the cybersecurity ecosystem, and a
selection of detection methods. A recent application security report showed 44%
of applications contain critical vulnerabilities in an open source component, a
concerning proportion. Most companies do not have a reliable way of being
directly and promptly notified when zero-day vulnerabilities are found and then
when patches are made available. This means attack vectors in open source exist
longer than necessary. Conventional approaches to vulnerability detection are
outlined alongside some newer research trends. A conclusion is made that it may
not be possible to entirely replace expert human inspection of open source
software, although it can be effectively augmented with techniques such as
machine learning, IDE plug-ins and repository linking to make implementation
and review less time intensive. Underpinning any technological advances should
be better knowledge at the human level. Development teams need trained, coached
and improved so they can implement open source more securely, know what
vulnerabilities to look for and how to handle them. It is the use of this
blended approach to detection which is key.

that directly follows from the causality principle and topology of a system
state space. In generalized mechanics, the Hamiltonian/Schrodinger equations
remain the same, but the Hamiltonian may depend on the action and its
canonically conjugated variables as additional dynamical variables. This
extension of quantum mechanics indicates that the quantization of matter could
be an evolutionary process, and in the distant future, even massive bodies may
become entirely quantum objects without well-defined trajectories and shapes.
In the classical limit, the first approximation of the Hamiltonian with respect
to the action explains the accelerated expansion of the Universe, Hubble law,
formation of spiral galaxies with a non-Kepler curve of rotation velocity, and
asymmetry between distributions of matter and antimatter. This theory predicts
that our open universe could have extended pre-history and be preceded by a
long set of closed precursor universes.

infrastructure composed of a national network of facilities with enhancements
in technology and business models. These enhancements enable application-driven
and challenge-based research and development, and ensure that facilities are
accessible and sustainable. The main tenets are: a challenge-driven operational
model, a next-generation infrastructure to serve that operational model,
technology innovations needed for advanced facilities to speed up learning
cycles, and innovative cost-effective business models for sustainability.
Ultimately, the expected outcomes of such a participatory, scalable, and

to get an explicit form of the concerned metric function. To overcome this, the
notion of $\phi$-metric is developed by making a suitable modification in
triangle inequality and its properties are pretty similar to metric function.
It is shown that one can easily construct a $\phi$-metric from existing
generalized distance functions like S-metric, b-metric, etc. and those are
$\phi$-metrizable. The convergence of sequence on those metric spaces is
identical to the respective induced $\phi$-metric spaces. So, unlike metrics,
concerned $\phi$-metric can be easily constructed and $\phi$-metric functions
may play the role of metric functions substantially. Also, the structure of
$\phi$-metric spaces is studied and some fixed point theorems are established.
