tool to validate general relativity and provide reliable measurements of
principal black hole parameters: spin and mass. Such measurements are possible
though only for nearby supermassive black holes (SMBH) with Space-Earth Very
Long Baseline Interferometry (S-VLBI) in the submillimeter wavelength range.
For subrings to be distinguished S-EVLBI observations with long baselines at
the Lagrangian Sun-Earth L2 libration point are needed. However, the average
fluxes of nearby SMBH: Sagittarius A$^\ast$ (Sgr A$^\ast$) and M87$^\ast$ --
$F_\nu\sim 1$ Jy, are still insufficient to detect the signal from the photon
rings with even such long baselines. We argue that only manifestations of
flares in the submillimeter waveband in their accretion disks can reveal
observable signals from the photon rings with the S-EVLBI at L2. Such
observations will become possible within the planned join program of the {\it
Event Horizon Telescope} (EHT) and {\it Millimetron Space Observatory} (MSO),
and within the planned {\it next generation EHT} (ngEHT) project. Two different
observational tests for photons rings are discussed. The first one involves
observations of a time series of responds from subsequent subrings as can be
seen in a 1D visibility function within the join EHT-MSO configuration, the
second one -- measurements of an increase of the angle between subsequent
subrings in the 2D VLBI image which can be obtained within the ngEHT project.

other cognitive processes, such as those involving language production. In
order to investigate this claim, we analyse a dataset containing tweets of a
heterogeneous group of Twitter users (regular users and professional writers).
Leveraging a methodology similar to the one used to uncover the
well-established social cognitive constraints, we find regularities at both the
structural and semantic level. At the former, we find that a concentric layered
structure (which we call ego network of words, in analogy to the ego network of
social relationships) very well captures how individuals organise the words
they use. The size of the layers in this structure regularly grows
(approximately 2-3 times with respect to the previous one) when moving
outwards, and the two penultimate external layers consistently account for
approximately 60% and 30% of the used words, irrespective of the number of the
total number of layers of the user. For the semantic analysis, each ring of
each ego network is described by a semantic profile, which captures the topics
associated with the words in the ring. We find that ring #1 has a special role

the rings. We also show that the topics that are important in the innermost
ring also have the characteristic of being predominant in each of the other

penetration of new renewable energy sources in electric power systems. Such
sources differ from traditional productions in that, first, they induce larger,
undispatchable fluctuations in power generation and second, they lack inertia.
Therefore, substituting new renewables for traditional generation induces
stronger and more frequent disturbances and modifies the way disturbances
propagate across AC electric power grids. Recent measurements have indeed
reported long, non-Gaussian tails in the distribution of local grid-frequency
data. Large frequency deviations may induce grid instabilities, leading in
worst-case scenarios to cascading failures and large-scale blackouts. In this
manuscript, we investigate how correlated noise disturbances, characterized by
the cumulants of their distribution, propagate through meshed, high-voltage
power grids. We show that for a single source of fluctuations,
non-Gaussianities in the form of finite skewness and positive kurtosis of the
noise distribution propagate over the entire network when the noise correlation
time is larger than the network's intrinsic time scales, but that they vanish
over short distances if the noise fluctuates rapidly. We furthermore show that
a Berry-Esseen theorem leads to the vanishing of non-Gaussianities as the
number of uncorrelated noise sources increases. Our results show that the
persistence of non-Gaussian fluctuations of feed-in power have a global impact
on power-grid dynamics when they fluctuate over time scales larger than the
intrinsic time scales of the system, which, we argue, is the relevant regime in
real power grids. Our predictions are corroborated by numerical simulations on

VPR methods intelligently by evaluating complementarity for some specific VPR
datasets to achieve better performance. This, however, requires ground truth
information (correct matches) which is not available when a robot is deployed
in a real-world scenario. Moreover, running multiple VPR techniques in parallel
may be prohibitive for resource-constrained embedded platforms. To overcome
these limitations, this paper presents a probabilistic complementarity based
switching VPR system, SwitchHit. Our proposed system consists of multiple VPR
techniques, however, it does not simply run all techniques at once, rather
predicts the probability of correct match for an incoming query image and
dynamically switches to another complementary technique if the probability of
correctly matching the query is below a certain threshold. This innovative use
of multiple VPR techniques allow our system to be more efficient and robust
than other combined VPR approaches employing brute force and running multiple
VPR techniques at once. Thus making it more suitable for resource constrained
embedded systems and achieving an overall superior performance from what any
individual VPR method in the system could have by achieved running

such as non-linear least squares (NLLS) is the most widespread method for model
estimation, it suffers from local minima and high computational cost. Deep
Learning approaches are steadily replacing NL fitting, but come with the
limitation that the model needs to be retrained for each acquisition protocol
and noise level. The White Matter Tract Integrity (WMTI)-Watson model was
proposed as an implementation of the Standard Model of diffusion in white
matter that estimates model parameters from the diffusion and kurtosis tensors
(DKI). Here we proposed a deep learning approach based on the encoder-decoder
recurrent neural network (RNN) to increase the robustness and accelerate the
parameter estimation of WMTI-Watson. We use an embedding approach to render the
model insensitive to potential differences in distributions between training
data and experimental data. This RNN-based solver thus has the advantage of
being highly efficient in computation and more readily translatable to other
datasets, irrespective of acquisition protocol and underlying parameter
distributions as long as DKI was pre-computed from the data. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of NLLS, the RNN-based method and a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) on synthetic and in vivo datasets of rat and human brain. We
showed that the proposed RNN-based fitting approach had the advantage of highly
reduced computation time over NLLS (from hours to seconds), with similar
accuracy and precision but improved robustness, and superior translatability to
new datasets over MLP.

(eMSPs), whose binary evolution is poorly understood and believed to be
different to that of traditional MSP+He WD systems. Measuring the masses of the
stars in this system is important for testing hypotheses for the formation of
eMSPs. We have carried out observations of this pulsar with the Parkes and
MeerKAT radio telescopes. Our observations reveal a strong frequency evolution
of this pulsar's intensity, with a spectral index ($\alpha$) of $-3.13(2)$. The
sensitivity of MeerKAT has resulted in a $>10$-fold improvement in the timing
precision compared to older Parkes observations. Combined with the 8-year
timing baseline, it has allowed precise measurements of a proper motion and
three orbital ""post-Keplerian"" parameters: the rate of advance of periastron,
$\dot{\omega} = 0.00152(1) \, {\rm deg} \, yr^{-1}$ and the orthometric Shapiro
delay parameters, $h_3 = 0.89(7) \, \mu$s and $\varsigma = 0.88(2)$. Assuming
general relativity, we obtain $M_{p} = 1.71(2) \, M_{\odot}$ for the mass of
the pulsar and $M_{c} = 0.254(2) \, M_{\odot}$ for the mass of the companion;
the orbital inclination is 83.2(4) degrees. We find that the spin axis has a
misalignment relative to the orbital angular momentum of $> 4.8$ degrees at 99%
CI. While the value of $M_{\rm p}$ falls within the wide range observed in
eMSPs, $M_{\rm c}$ is significantly smaller than expected, allowing several
formation hypotheses being ruled out. $M_{\rm c}$ is also significantly
different from the expected value for an ideal low mass X-ray binary evolution
scenario. The putative misalignment between the spin axis of the pulsar and the
orbital angular momentum suggests that the unknown process that created the
orbital eccentricity of the binary was also capable of changing its orbital
orientation, an important evidence for understanding the origin of eMSPs.

designers) to correctly assess the dependencies within the epidemic. With our
model, we find that digital contact tracing alone can rarely tame an epidemic:
for unrestrained COVID-19, this would require a testing turnaround of around 1
day and app uptake above 80% of the population, which are very difficult to
achieve in practice. However, digital contact tracing can still be effective if
complemented with other mitigation strategies, such as social distancing and

interaction potentials driven over random pinning and compare the behavior
under drives applied parallel and perpendicular to the anisotropy direction.
The number of topological defects reaches a maximum near depinning and then
drops with increasing driving force as the vortices form one-dimensional
chains. This coincides with a transition from a pinned nematic to a moving
smectic aligned with the soft direction of the anisotropy. The system is
generally more ordered when the drive is applied along the soft direction of
the anisotropy, while for driving along the hard direction, there is a critical
value of the anisotropy above which the system remains aligned with the soft
direction. We also observe hysteresis in the dynamics, with one-dimensional
aligned chains persisting during a decreasing drive sweep to drives below the
threshold for chain formation during the increasing drive sweep. More
anisotropic systems have a greater amount of structural disorder in the moving
state. For lower anisotropy, the system forms a moving smectic-A state, while
at higher anisotropy, a moving nematic state appears instead.

  is critically linked to past colonial world order and offshore fiscal havens",,,,,"econ.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The governance of the political and economic world order builds on a complex
architecture of international treaties at various geographical scales. In a
historical phase of high institutional turbulence, assessing the stability of
such architecture with respect to the unilateral defection of single countries
and to the breakdown of single treaties is important. We carry out this
analysis on the whole global architecture and find that the countries with the
highest disruption potential are not major world powers (with the exception of
Germany and France) but mostly medium-small and micro-countries. Political
stability is highly dependent on many former colonial overseas territories that
are today part of the global network of fiscal havens, as well as on emerging
economies, mostly from South-East Asia. Economic stability depends on medium
sized European and African countries. However, single global treaties have
surprisingly less disruptive potential, with the major exception of the WTO.
These apparently counter-intuitive results highlight the importance to a
nonlinear approach to international relations where the complex multilayered
architecture of global governance is analyzed using advanced network science
techniques. Our results suggest that the potential fragility of the world order
seem to be much more directly related to global inequality and fiscal injustice
than it is commonly believed, and that the legacy of the colonial world order
is still very strong in the current international relations scenario. In
particular, vested interests related to tax avoidance seem to have a structural
role in the political architecture of global governance

ingredient is the use of well established spline spaces forming a discrete de

splines of degree $p$, and a dual sequence $\{\tilde{X}^k_h\}_{k=0}^n$,
starting from splines of degree $p-1$. By imposing homogeneous boundary
conditions to the spaces of the primal sequence, the two sequences can be
isomorphically mapped into one another. Within this setup, many familiar second
order partial differential equations can be finally accommodated by explicitly
constructing appropriate discrete versions of constitutive relations, called
Hodge--star operators. Several alternatives based on both global and local
projection operators between spline spaces will be proposed. The appeal of the
approach with respect to similar published methods is twofold: firstly, it
exhibits high order convergence. Secondly, it does not rely on the geometric
realization of any (topologically) dual mesh. Several numerical examples in
various space dimensions will be employed to validate the central ideas of the
proposed approach and compare its features with the standard Galerkin approach

refractory ceramics is of importance for aiding design of hard materials with
enhanced fracture resistance. We carry out ab initio and classical molecular
dynamics (AIMD and CMD) investigations at temperatures between 300 and 1200 K
to identify atomic-scale mechanisms responsible for brittle fracture vs
slip-induced crack-blunting in Ti-N ceramics. AIMD simulations of
single-crystal and notched TiN lattices (1100 atoms) subject to tensile and
shear deformation serve to verify predictions of mechanical properties
separately obtained by CMD. Benchmarked by AIMD results, CMD is thus
confidently used to probe the mechanical response of large (40000 atoms)
notched TiN and TiNx models under mode-I tension. Although crack growth occurs
in most cases, CMD simulations reveal that typically-brittle TiN and TiNx
ceramics can - for comparable rates of accumulation of tensile and shear stress
around a flaw - prevent fracture via nucleation and emission of dislocations
from the notch tip. Furthermore, we identify descriptors based on properties
calculated for ideal single-crystals which reproduce trends in mechanical
behavior of flawed lattices. Specifically: (i) the probability of notched
ceramics to resist fracture via slip-induced plasticity exhibits linear
relationship with ideal tensile-to-shear strength ratios (Iplasticity), (ii) at
parity of Iplasticity values, the effective strength (fracture stress) of
defective systems ranks according to the tensile strength of corresponding
single-crystal phases. The descriptors proposed in this work pave the way for
high-throughput screening of ceramics that may combine high strength to
superior fracture resistance at room and elevated temperature.

inspiralling neutron star binaries become relevant at GW frequencies of a few
hundred Hz and require detectors with exquisite high-frequency sensitivity.
Third generation GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer
will be particularly sensitive in this high-frequency regime, allowing us to
probe neutron star tides beyond the adiabatic approximation. Here we assess
whether dynamical tides can be measured from a neutron star inspiral. We find
that the measurability of dynamical tides depends strongly on the neutron star
mass and equation of state. For a semi-realistic population of 10,000
inspiralling binary neutron stars, we conservatively estimate that on average
$\mathcal{O}(50)$ binaries will have measurable dynamical tides. As dynamical
tides are characterised not only by the star's tidal deformability but also by
its fundamental ($f$-) mode frequency, they present a possibility of probing
higher-order tidal effects and test consistency with quasi-universal relations.

the stars' $f$-mode frequencies can be measured to within a few hundred Hz.

visualizing deep neural network (DNN) behavior during multi-parametric MRI
(mp-MRI) based glioma segmentation as a method to enhance deep learning
explainability. Methods: By hypothesizing that deep feature extraction can be
modeled as a spatiotemporally continuous process, we designed a novel deep
learning model, neural ODE, in which deep feature extraction was governed by an
ODE without explicit expression. The dynamics of 1) MR images after
interactions with DNN and 2) segmentation formation can be visualized after
solving ODE. An accumulative contribution curve (ACC) was designed to
quantitatively evaluate the utilization of each MRI by DNN towards the final
segmentation results. The proposed neural ODE model was demonstrated using 369
glioma patients with a 4-modality mp-MRI protocol: T1, contrast-enhanced T1
(T1-Ce), T2, and FLAIR. Three neural ODE models were trained to segment
enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT). The key MR
modalities with significant utilization by DNN were identified based on ACC
analysis. Segmentation results by DNN using only the key MR modalities were
compared to the ones using all 4 MR modalities. Results: All neural ODE models
successfully illustrated image dynamics as expected. ACC analysis identified
T1-Ce as the only key modality in ET and TC segmentations, while both FLAIR and
T2 were key modalities in WT segmentation. Compared to the U-Net results using
all 4 MR modalities, Dice coefficient of ET (0.784->0.775), TC (0.760->0.758),
and WT (0.841->0.837) using the key modalities only had minimal differences
without significance. Conclusion: The neural ODE model offers a new tool for
optimizing the deep learning model inputs with enhanced explainability. The
presented methodology can be generalized to other medical image-related deep
learning applications.

defined as the minimum visual content changes that the human can perspective,
which has been studied for decades. However, most of the existing methods only
focus on the luminance component of JND modelling and simply regard chrominance
components as scaled versions of luminance. In this paper, we propose a JND
model to generate the JND by taking the characteristics of full RGB channels
into account, termed as the RGB-JND. To this end, an RGB-JND-NET is proposed,
where the visual content in full RGB channels is used to extract features for
JND generation. To supervise the JND generation, an adaptive image quality
assessment combination (AIC) is developed. Besides, the RDB-JND-NET also takes
the visual attention into account by automatically mining the underlying
relationship between visual attention and the JND, which is further used to
constrain the JND spatial distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work on careful investigation of JND modelling for full-color space.
Experimental results demonstrate that the RGB-JND-NET model outperforms the
relevant state-of-the-art JND models. Besides, the JND of the red and blue
channels are larger than that of the green one according to the experimental
results of the proposed model, which demonstrates that more changes can be
tolerated in the red and blue channels, in line with the well-known fact that
the human visual system is more sensitive to the green channel in comparison
with the red and blue ones.

imaging bursts emerge out of noise and without applying (Radio Frequency) RF
pulses when placing spins with sufficient population inversion in a weak
magnetic field gradient. A small difference in initial population inversion
density creates a stronger image contrast than conventional MRI. This contrast
is based on the cooperative nonlinear interaction between all slices. On the
other hand, the cooperative nonlinear interaction gives rise to imaging
artifacts, such as amplitude distortions and side lobes outside of the imaging
domain. Both the contrast and the artifacts are demonstrated experimentally and

the process systems engineering and control communities. Recent works have
investigated the application of RL to identify optimal scheduling decision in

to efficiently address production scheduling problems in the presence of

optimization of risk-sensitive formulations such as the conditional

The proposed strategy is investigated thoroughly in a parallel batch production
environment, and benchmarked against mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
strategies. We show that the policy identified by our approach is able to
account for plant uncertainties in online decision-making, with expected
performance comparable to existing MILP methods. Additionally, the framework
gains the benefits of optimizing for risk-sensitive measures, and identifies
online decisions orders of magnitude faster than the most efficient

are expected to be replaced by post-quantum schemes in the next decade in
billions of devices. To facilitate the transition, NIST is running a
standardization process which is currently in its final Round. Only three
digital signature schemes are left in the competition, among which Dilithium
and Falcon are the ones based on lattices. Classical fault attacks on signature
schemes make use of pairs of faulty and correct signatures to recover the
secret key which only works on deterministic schemes. To counter such attacks,
Dilithium offers a randomized version which makes each signature unique, even
when signing identical messages.
  In this work, we introduce a novel Signature Correction Attack which not only
applies to the deterministic version but also to the randomized version of
Dilithium and is effective even on constant-time implementations using AVX2
instructions. The Signature Correction Attack exploits the mathematical
structure of Dilithium to recover the secret key bits by using faulty
signatures and the public-key. It can work for any fault mechanism which can
induce single bit-flips. For demonstration, we are using Rowhammer induced
faults. Thus, our attack does not require any physical access or special
privileges, and hence could be also implemented on shared cloud servers. We
perform a thorough classical and quantum security analysis of Dilithium and
successfully recover 1,851 bits out of 3,072 bits of secret key $s_1$ for
security level 2. The lattice strength against quantum attackers is reduced
from $2^{128}$ to $2^{81}$ while the strength against classical attackers is
reduced from $2^{141}$ to $2^{89}$. Hence, the Signature Correction Attack may
be employed to achieve a practical attack on Dilithium (security level 2) as
proposed in Round 3 of the NIST post-quantum standardization process.

message passing steps. Although there has been an emerging interest in the
design of scalable GNNs, current researches focus on specific GNN design,
rather than the general design space, limiting the discovery of potential
scalable GNN models. This paper proposes PasCa, a new paradigm and system that
offers a principled approach to systemically construct and explore the design

deconstructing the message passing mechanism, PasCa presents a novel Scalable

implement an auto-search engine that can automatically search well-performing

among practitioners of sensitivity analysis of model outputs. A variance-based
sensitivity analysis typically produces the first-order sensitivity indices
$S_j$ and the so-called total-effect sensitivity indices $T_j$ for the
uncertain factors of the mathematical model under analysis.
  The cost of the analysis depends upon the number of model evaluations needed
to obtain stable and accurate values of the estimates. While efficient
estimation procedures are available for $S_j$, this availability is less the
case for $T_j$. When estimating these indices, one can either use a
sample-based approach whose computational cost depends on the number of factors
or use approaches based on meta modelling/emulators.
  The present work focuses on sample-based estimation procedures for $T_j$ and
tests different avenues to achieve an algorithmic improvement over the existing
best practices. To improve the exploration of the space of the input factors
(design) and the formula to compute the indices (estimator), we propose
strategies based on the concepts of economy and explorativity. We then discuss
how several existing estimators perform along these characteristics.
  We conclude that: a) sample-based approaches based on the use of multiple
matrices to enhance the economy are outperformed by designs using fewer
matrices but with better explorativity; b) among the latter, asymmetric designs
perform the best and outperform symmetric designs having corrective terms for
spurious correlations; c) improving on the existing best practices is fraught
with difficulties; and d) ameliorating the results comes at the cost of
introducing extra design parameters.

end, radiomics was proposed as a field of study where images are used instead
of invasive methods. The first step in radiomic analysis is the segmentation of
the lesion. However, this task is time consuming and can be physician
subjective. Automated tools based on supervised deep learning have made great
progress to assist physicians. However, they are data hungry, and annotated
data remains a major issue in the medical field where only a small subset of
annotated images is available. Methods: In this work, we propose a multi-task
learning framework to predict patient's survival and response. We show that the
encoder can leverage multiple tasks to extract meaningful and powerful features
that improve radiomics performance. We show also that subsidiary tasks serve as
an inductive bias so that the model can better generalize. Results: Our model
was tested and validated for treatment response and survival in lung and
esophageal cancers, with an area under the ROC curve of 77% and 71%

the fraction of shortest paths visiting that node. The computation of the
betweenness centrality measure is a fundamental task in the analysis of modern
networks, enabling the identification of the most central nodes in such
networks. Additionally to being massive, modern networks also contain
information about the time at which their events occur. Such networks are often
called temporal networks. The temporal information makes the study of the
betweenness centrality in temporal networks (i.e., temporal betweenness
centrality) much more challenging than in static networks (i.e., networks
without temporal information). Moreover, the exact computation of the temporal
betweenness centrality is often impractical on even moderately-sized networks,
given its extremely high computational cost. A natural approach to reduce such
computational cost is to obtain high-quality estimates of the exact values of
the temporal betweenness centrality. In this work we present ONBRA, the first
sampling-based approximation algorithm for estimating the temporal betweenness
centrality values of the nodes in a temporal network, providing rigorous
probabilistic guarantees on the quality of its output. ONBRA is able to compute
the estimates of the temporal betweenness centrality values under two different
optimality criteria for the shortest paths of the temporal network. In
addition, ONBRA outputs high-quality estimates with sharp theoretical
guarantees leveraging on the \emph{empirical Bernstein bound}, an advanced
concentration inequality. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows that ONBRA
significantly reduces the computational resources required by the exact
computation of the temporal betweenness centrality on several real world

(introduced by object deformation and high-speed action) and strict task
requirements (defined by a precise goal specification). To address these
challenges, we present Iterative Residual Policy (IRP), a general learning
framework applicable to repeatable tasks with complex dynamics. IRP learns an
implicit policy via delta dynamics -- instead of modeling the entire dynamical
system and inferring actions from that model, IRP learns delta dynamics that
predict the effects of delta action on the previously-observed trajectory. When
combined with adaptive action sampling, the system can quickly optimize its
actions online to reach a specified goal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
IRP on two tasks: whipping a rope to hit a target point and swinging a cloth to
reach a target pose. Despite being trained only in simulation on a fixed robot
setup, IRP is able to efficiently generalize to noisy real-world dynamics, new
objects with unseen physical properties, and even different robot hardware
embodiments, demonstrating its excellent generalization capability relative to
alternative approaches. Video is available at https://youtu.be/7h3SZ3La-oA

neglect that BN is severely biased to the training domain and inevitably
suffers the performance drop if directly generalized without being updated. To

modulates the feature distribution normalized by BN to adapt to the target

namely part positioning and part nearest neighbor matching, which help the
model mine the domain-aware information with respect to the structure and
identity of body parts, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, we conduct extensive experiments on three re-id datasets and confirm

necessity and possibility of a statement should not solely rely on the
satisfaction relation in each world and the accessibility relation. The value

the newest members of this family where Co atoms are intercalated into the Van

band structure of Co1/3NbS2 using both surface and bulk sensitive
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We show that the electronic bands do
not fit into the rigid-band-shift picture after the Co intercalation. Instead,
Co1/3NbS2 displays a different orbital character near the Fermi level compared
to the pristine NbS2 compound and has a clear band dispersion in kz direction
despite its layered structure. Our photoemission study demonstrates the
out-of-plane electronic correlations introduced by the Co intercalation, thus
offering a new perspective on this compound. Finally, we propose how Fermi
level tuning could lead to exotic phases such as spin density wave instability.

Array (ALMA). From the combined analysis of the disk morphology, the
two-dimensional velocity structure, and forward-modeling of the one-dimensional
velocity and velocity dispersion profiles, we conclude that HZ4 has a regular
rotating disk in place. The intrinsic velocity dispersion in HZ4 is high
($\sigma_{0}=65.8^{+2.9}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$), and the ratio between the
rotational velocity and the intrinsic velocity dispersion is $V_{\rm

the trends of increasing $\sigma_{0}$ and decreasing $V_{\rm rot}/\sigma_{0}$
as a function of redshift observed in main-sequence galaxies up to $z\approx4$.
Galaxy evolution models suggest that the high level of turbulence observed in
HZ4 can only be achieved if, in addition to stellar feedback, there is radial
transport of gas within the disk. Finally, we find that HZ4 is baryon dominated
on galactic scales ($\lesssim2\times R_{\rm e}$), with a dark matter fraction
at one effective radius of $f_{\rm DM}(R_{\rm e})=0.41^{+0.25}_{-0.22}$. This
value is comparable to the dark matter fractions found in lower redshift

passive, early type galaxies at $z\approx0$.

perhaps one of the most compelling lines of evidence -- have proven
comparatively elusive. In this work, we test the capabilities of ALMA to detect
the planet-driven spiral signal in continuum emission. Carrying out
hydrodynamic simulations and radiative transfer calculations, we present
synthetic Band 7 continuum images for a wide range of disk and observing
conditions. We show that thermal mass planets at tens of au typically drive
spirals detectable within a few hours of integration time, and the detectable
planet mass may be as low as $\sim$Neptune mass ($0.3 \, M_{\rm th}$). The
grains probed by ALMA form spirals morphologically identical to the underlying
gas spiral. The temperature of the dust spiral is crucial in determining its
contrast, and spirals are easier to detect in disks with an adiabatic equation
of state and longer cooling times. Resolving the spiral is not necessary for
its detection; with the help of residual maps, the optimal beam size is a few
times the spiral width at a constant noise level. Finally, we show how the
presence of gaps and rings can impair our ability to recognize co-located

computing where they are used to solve a broad variety of problems, e.g., in
the design of classical circuits and systems. Analogous to the classical realm,
quantum algorithms are usually modelled as circuits and similar design tasks
need to be tackled. Thus, it is natural to pose the question whether these
design tasks in the quantum realm can also be approached using SAT techniques.
To the best of our knowledge, no SAT formulation for arbitrary quantum circuits
exists and it is unknown whether such an approach is feasible at all. In this
work, we define a propositional SAT encoding that, in principle, can be applied
to arbitrary quantum circuits. However, we show that due to the inherent
complexity of representing quantum states, constructing such an encoding is not
feasible in general. Therefore, we establish general criteria for determining
the feasibility of the proposed encoding and identify classes of quantum
circuits fulfilling these criteria. We explicitly demonstrate how the proposed
encoding can be applied to the class of Clifford circuits as a representative.
Finally, we empirically demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the
proposed encoding for Clifford circuits. With these results, we lay the
foundation for continuing the ongoing success of SAT in classical circuit and
systems design for quantum circuits.

the cold neutral medium (CNM) and the thermally unstable neutral medium (UNM)
up to T <~ 400 K, the density PDF follows the log-normal distribution whose
width sigma_s is well explained by the known relation from the isothermal
turbulence as sigma_s = ln(1 + b^2 * M^2) (where b is the parameter
representing the turbulence mode ratio and M is the turbulent Mach number). The
density PDF of the CNM component alone (T <= 50 K), however, exhibits a
narrower sigma_s by a factor of ~ 2. These results suggest that observational
estimations of b based on the CNM density PDF requires the internal turbulence
within each CNM clump but not the inter-clump relative velocity, the latter of
which is instead powered by the WNM/UNM turbulence.

increasingly important task for the development and testing of quantum
algorithms. In order to alleviate this inherent complexity, efficient data
structures and methods such as tensor networks and decision diagrams have been
proposed. However, their efficiency heavily depends on the order in which the
individual computations are performed. For tensor networks the order is defined
by so-called contraction plans and a plethora of methods has been developed to
determine suitable plans. On the other hand, simulation based on decision
diagrams is mostly conducted in a straight-forward, i.e., sequential, fashion
thus far. In this work, we study the importance of the path that is chosen when
simulating quantum circuits using decision diagrams and show, conceptually and
experimentally, that choosing the right simulation path can make a vast
difference in the efficiency of classical simulations using decision diagrams.
We propose an open-source framework (available at github.com/cda-tum/ddsim)
that not only allows to investigate dedicated simulation paths, but also to
re-use existing findings, e.g., obtained from determining contraction plans for
tensor networks. Experimental evaluations show that translating strategies from
the domain of tensor networks may yield speedups of several factors compared to
the state of the art. Furthermore, we design a dedicated simulation path
heuristic that allows to improve the performance even further -- frequently
yielding speedups of several orders of magnitude. Finally, we provide an
extensive discussion on what can be learned from tensor networks and what
cannot.

generate accurate regression predictions of intelligence scores. Network
topology-based feature selection provides for natively interpretable networks

different form of the coupling between the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet
invariant, a new type of scalarization is possible beyond the standard one that
can be excited only nonlinearly. In this case the spectrum of black hole
solutions can be more complicated, naturally opening the question about their
stability. The goal of the present paper is to study this question including
the possible loss of hyperbolicity of the radial perturbation equation. We show
that one of the nonlinearly scalarized phases of the Schwarzschild black hole

(TDD) mode with user-centric clusters of remote radio units (RUs). Since the
uplink pilot dimensions per channel coherence slot is limited, co-pilot users
might incur mutual pilot contamination. In the current literature, it is
assumed that the long-term statistical knowledge of all user channels is
available. This enables Minimum Mean-Square Error channel estimation or
simplified dominant subspace projection, which achieves significant pilot
decontamination under certain assumptions on the channel covariance matrices.
However, estimating the channel covariance matrix or even just its dominant
subspace at all RUs forming a user cluster is not an easy task. In fact, if not
properly designed, a piloting scheme for such long-term statistics estimation
will also be subject to the contamination problem. In this paper, we propose a
new channel subspace estimation scheme explicitly designed for cell-free
wireless networks. Our scheme is based on 1) a sounding reference signal (SRS)
using latin squares wideband frequency hopping, and 2) a subspace estimation
method based on robust Principal Component Analysis (R-PCA). The SRS hopping
scheme ensures that for any user and any RU participating in its cluster, only
a few pilot measurements will contain strong co-pilot interference. These few
heavily contaminated measurements are (implicitly) eliminated by R-PCA, which
is designed to regularize the estimation and discount the ``outlier''
measurements. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves
almost perfect subspace knowledge, which in turns yields system performance
very close to that with ideal channel state information, thus essentially
solving the problem of pilot contamination in cell-free user-centric TDD
wireless networks.

problem Hamiltonian and optimize its energy by varying over a set of states
with low circuit complexity. Classical processing is typically only used for
the choice of variational parameters following gradient descent. As a
consequence, these approaches are limited by the descriptive power of the
associated states.
  We argue that for certain combinatorial optimization problems, such
algorithms can be hybridized further, thus harnessing the power of efficient
non-local classical processing. Specifically, we consider combining a quantum
variational ansatz with a greedy classical post-processing procedure for the
MaxCut-problem on $3$-regular graphs. We show that the average cut-size
produced by this method can be quantified in terms of the energy of a modified
problem Hamiltonian. This motivates the consideration of an improved algorithm
which variationally optimizes the energy of the modified Hamiltonian. We call
this a twisted hybrid algorithm since the additional classical processing step
is combined with a different choice of variational parameters. We exemplify the
viability of this method using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm
(QAOA), giving analytic lower bounds on the expected approximation ratios
achieved by twisted QAOA. These show that the necessary non-locality of the
quantum ansatz can be reduced compared to the original QAOA: We find that for
levels $p=2,\ldots, 6$, the level $p$ can be reduced by one while roughly
maintaining the expected approximation ratio. This reduces the circuit depth by
$4$ and the number of variational parameters by $2$.

Because of this, the formation and survival of molecules in star-forming
regions located in the inner and outer Galaxy is expected to be different. To
gain understanding on how chemistry changes throughout the Milky Way, it is
crucial to observe outer Galaxy star-forming regions to constrain models
adapted for lower metallicity environments. In this paper we present a new
observational project: chemical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer
Galaxy (CHEMOUT). The goal is to unveil the chemical composition in 35 dense
molecular clouds associated with star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy
through observations obtained with the IRAM 30m telescope. In this first paper,
we present the sample, and report the detection at 3~mm of simple organic
species HCO+, H13CO+, HCN, c-C3H2, HCO, C4H, and HCS+, of the complex
hydrocarbon CH3CCH, and of SiO, CCS and SO. From c-C3H2, we estimate new
kinematic heliocentric and Galactocentric distances based on an updated
rotation curve of the Galaxy. The detection of the molecular tracers does not
seem to have a clear dependence on the Galactocentric distance. We also analyse
the HCO+ line profiles. We find high velocity wings in ~71% of the targets, and
their occurrence does not depend on the Galactocentric distance. Our results,
confirmed by a statistical analysis, show that the presence of organic
molecules and tracers of protostellar activity is ubiquitous in the
low-metallicity environment of the outer Galaxy. Based on this, and on the
additional evidence that small, terrestrial planets are omnipresent in the
Galaxy, we support previous claims that the definition of Galactic Habitable
Zone should be rediscussed in view of the ubiquitous capacity of the
interstellar medium to form organic molecules.

tails are unusually long and narrow. Its -50 km/s line-of-sight velocity
qualifies it as an intermediate velocity cloud, but the tails' orientations
indicate that the cloud's total three-dimensional speed is at least ~100 km/s.
This speed is supersonic in the Reynold's Layer and thick disk. We simulated
the cloud as it travels supersonically through the Galactic thick and thin
disks at an oblique angle relative to the midplane. Our simulated clouds grow
long double tails and reasonably reproduce the H I 21~cm intensity and velocity
of the head of the PP Arch. A bow shock protects each simulated cloud from
excessive shear and lowers its Reynolds number. These factors may similarly
protect the PP Arch and enable the survival of its unusually long tails. The
simulations predict the future hydrodynamic behavior of the cloud when it
collides with denser gas nearer to the Galactic midplane. It appears that the
PP Arch's fate is to deform, dissipate, and merge with the Galactic disk.

used for information transmission are stored, released, and then replenished by
a transmitter (TX). However, the replenishment of signaling molecules at the TX
is challenging in practice. Furthermore, in most envisioned MC applications,
e.g., in the medical field, it is not desirable to insert the TX into the MC
system, as this might impair natural biological processes. In this paper, we
propose the concept of media modulation based MC where the TX is placed outside
the channel and utilizes signaling molecules already present inside the system.
The signaling molecules can assume different states which can be switched by
external stimuli. Hence, in media modulation based MC, the TX modulates
information into the state of the signaling molecules. In particular, we
exploit the group of photochromic molecules, which undergo light-induced
reversible state transitions, for media modulation. We study the usage of these
molecules for information transmission in a three-dimensional duct system,
which contains an eraser, a TX, and a receiver for erasing, writing, and
reading of information via external light, respectively. We develop a
statistical model for the received signal. We adopt a maximum likelihood
detector and show that it can be reduced to a threshold based detector.
Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the optimal threshold value
and the resulting bit error rate (BER), respectively. Finally, we investigate
the impact of various system parameters on the BER of media modulation based
MC. Both the statistical model and BER results are verified by computer
simulations. Our results reveal that media modulation enables reliable
information transmission, validating it as a promising alternative to MC based
on molecule emitting TXs.

that is often characterized by an overall decrease in walking speed and a
unilateral decrease in step length. With millions currently affected by this
dysfunctional gait, robust and effective rehabilitation protocols are needed.
Although robotic devices have been used in numerous rehabilitation protocols
for gait, the lack of significant aftereffects that translate to effective
therapy makes their application still questionable. This paper proposes a novel
type of robot-assisted intervention that results in significant aftereffects
that last much longer than any other previous study. With the utilization of a
novel robotic device, the Variable Stiffness Treadmill (VST), the stiffness of
the walking surface underneath one leg is decreased for a number of steps. This
unilateral stiffness perturbation results in a significant aftereffect that is
both useful for stroke rehabilitation and often lasts for over 200 gait cycles
after the intervention has concluded. More specifically, the aftereffect
created is an increase in both left and right step lengths, with the
unperturbed step length increasing significantly more than the perturbed. These
effects may be helpful in correcting two of the most common issues in
post-stroke gait: overall decrease in walking speed and a unilateral shortened
step length. The results of this work show that a robot-assisted therapy
protocol involving repeated unilateral stiffness perturbations can lead to a
more permanent and effective solution to post-stroke gait.

wave function of a quarkonium, in theories with non-trivial rapidity
evolutions. We found that the rapidity evolution drastically changes the

theory. At large $N_c$, the reduced density matrices that ""resum"" the leading
rapidity-logs can be explicitly constructed, and shown to satisfy
Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK)-like evolution equations. We study their entanglement
entropy in a simplified $1+1$ toy model, and in 3D QCD. The entanglement
entropy in these cases, after re-summation, is shown to saturate the
Kolmogorov-Sinai bound of 1. Remarkably, in 3D QCD the essential growth rate of
the entanglement entropy is found to vanish at large rapidities, a result of
kinematical ""quenching"" in transverse space. The one-body reduction of the
entangled density matrix obeys a BFKL evolution equation, which can be recast
as an evolution in an emergent AdS space, at large impact-parameter and large
rapidity. This observation allows the extension of the perturbative wee parton
evolution at low-x, to a dual non-perturbative evolution of string bits in
curved AdS$_5$ space, with manifest entanglement entropy in the confining

challenges related to detection and reconstruction of low-energy (less than 100
MeV) signatures in liquid argon time-projection chamber (LArTPC) detectors. Key
takeaways are summarized as follows. 1) LArTPCs have unique sensitivity to a
range of physics and astrophysics signatures via detection of event features at
and below the few tens of MeV range. 2) Low-energy signatures are an integral
part of GeV-scale accelerator neutrino interaction final states, and their
reconstruction can enhance the oscillation physics sensitivities of LArTPC
experiments. 3) BSM signals from accelerator and natural sources also generate
diverse signatures in the low-energy range, and reconstruction of these
signatures can increase the breadth of BSM scenarios accessible in LArTPC-based
searches. 4) Neutrino interaction cross sections and other nuclear physics
processes in argon relevant to sub-hundred-MeV LArTPC signatures are poorly
understood. Improved theory and experimental measurements are needed. Pion
decay-at-rest sources and charged particle and neutron test beams are ideal
facilities for experimentally improving this understanding. 5) There are
specific calibration needs in the low-energy range, as well as specific needs
for control and understanding of radiological and cosmogenic backgrounds. 6)
Novel ideas for future LArTPC technology that enhance low-energy capabilities
should be explored. These include novel charge enhancement and readout systems,
enhanced photon detection, low radioactivity argon, and xenon doping. 7)
Low-energy signatures, whether steady-state or part of a supernova burst or
larger GeV-scale event topology, have specific triggering, DAQ and
reconstruction requirements that must be addressed outside the scope of
conventional GeV-scale data collection and analysis pathways.

records at a medium-sized US Regional Optical Network to quantify the changes

that human-driven traffic in the network decreases to around 70%, and mostly
shifts to local ISPs, while VPN and online meeting traffic increases up to 5
times. We also find that networks adopt a variety of online meeting solutions
and favor one but continue using a few others. We find that educational and
government institutions experience large traffic changes, but aim to keep their
productivity via increased online meetings. Some scientific traffic also
reduces possibly leading to loss of research productivity. Businesses mostly
lose their traffic and few show VPN or online meeting activity. Most network
prefixes experience large loss of live addresses but a handful increase their
liveness. We also find increased incidence of network attacks. Our findings can
help plan network provisioning and management to prepare for future possible
infection outbreaks and natural disasters.

of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology to comprehensively uncover functional and

multiscale modeling of both scRNA-seq data and proteomics data. The innovative
and cross-disciplinary approach can be further applied to other computational
studies in tumorigenesis and oncotherapy. Results: A time series of lung
adenocarcinoma-derived A549 cells after DEX treatment were analysed. (1) We
first discovered the differentially expressed genes in those lung cancer cells.
Then through the interrogation of their regulatory network, we identified key
hub genes including TGF-\b{eta}, MYC, and SMAD3 varied underlie DEX treatment.
Further enrichment analysis revealed the TGF-\b{eta} signaling pathway as the
top enriched term. Those genes involved in the TGF-\b{eta} pathway and their
crosstalk with the ERBB pathway presented a strong survival prognosis in
clinical lung cancer samples. (2) Based on biological validation and further
curation, a multiscale model of tumor regulation centered on both
TGF-\b{eta}-induced and ERBB-amplified signaling pathways was developed to
characterize the dynamics effects of DEX therapy on lung cancer cells. Our
simulation results were well matched to available data of SMAD2, FOXO3,
TGF\b{eta}1, and TGF\b{eta}R1 over the time course. Moreover, we provided
predictions of different doses to illustrate the trend and therapeutic

we bridge the gap between the mathematical literature on localization of

organizational interaction networks. To do so, we introduce a new model that
considers a layered structure of teams to unveil a new form of hierarchical
localization (i.e., the localization of information at the top or center of an
organization) and study its interplay with known phenomena of mesoscopic
localization (i.e., the localization of information in large groups), $k$-core
localization (i.e., around denser $k$-cores) and hub localization (i.e., around
high degree stars). We also include a complex contagion mechanism by
considering a general infection kernel which can depend on hierarchical level
(influence), degree (popularity), infectious neighbors (social reinforcement)
or team size (importance). This general model allows us to study the
multifaceted phenomenon of information siloing in complex organizational
interaction networks and opens the door to new optimization problems to promote

by the frequently changing and unpredictable uncertainties at different
timescales. Under this scope, this paper investigates the coordinated energy
management problem for day-ahead and intra-day conditions considering
uncertainties of source-load and market prices concurrently. Note that the
precise knowledge of distributions about uncertainties may be unaccessible
before the decision-making in day-ahead phase. A two-stage chance-constrained
model based on distributionally robust approach with ambiguous moment
information is proposed to immunize scheduling strategies against the
worst-case probability distributions. The first stage is dedicated to obtaining
more energy arbitrage and operation flexibility by optimizing bidding
strategies in day-ahead power, natural gas and carbon markets. The second stage
focuses on the optimization of worst-case expected operation cost. It provides
a robust energy equipment and load scheduling strategy for the reference of
subsequent intra-day arrangements. With respect to different variations of
electrical and thermal components, an intra-day two-timescale coordination is
implemented step by step. The energy scheduling is re-dispatched circularly to
minimize the operation and penalty costs. The possible energy imbalance is also
compensated by this way. As the energy management program is nonlinear,
chance-constrained and multi-stage, linearization and dual transformation
techniques are designed to enhance tractability of programs. Experimental
results show that the developed multi-level framework results in a carbon
emission decrease of 37%, and reduces energy cost averagely 3% compared with
corresponding contrasting cases. The obtained strategy validates a good
tradeoff between robustness and optimality.

years. Despite their great performance, they incur high computational cost. A
common solution is to apply model compression or choose light-weight
architectures, which often need a separate fixed-size model for each desirable
computational budget, and may lose performance in case of heavy compression.
This paper proposes an effective dynamic inference approach, called E-LANG,
which distributes the inference between large accurate Super-models and
light-weight Swift models. To this end, a decision making module routes the
inputs to Super or Swift models based on the energy characteristics of the
representations in the latent space. This method is easily adoptable and
architecture agnostic. As such, it can be applied to black-box pre-trained
models without a need for architectural manipulations, reassembling of modules,
or re-training. Unlike existing methods that are only applicable to
encoder-only backbones and classification tasks, our method also works for
encoder-decoder structures and sequence-to-sequence tasks such as translation.
The E-LANG performance is verified through a set of experiments with T5 and
BERT backbones on GLUE, SuperGLUE, and WMT. In particular, we outperform T5-11B
with an average computations speed-up of 3.3$\times$ on GLUE and 2.9$\times$ on
SuperGLUE. We also achieve BERT-based SOTA on GLUE with 3.2$\times$ less
computations. Code and demo are available in the supplementary materials.

the vibrational properties of molecular compounds or solid state systems. From
a spectroscopic perspective, SRS is able to capture Raman spectra free from

several orders of magnitude with respect to its spontaneous counterpart. Since
its discovery in 1962, SRS has been applied to develop technological
applications, such as Raman-based lasers, frequency shifters for pulsed sources
and Raman amplifiers. For the full exploitation of their potential, however, it
is crucial to have an accurate description of the SRS processes under the large
gain regime. Here, by taking as an example the stimulated Raman spectrum of a
model solvent, namely liquid cyclohexane, we discuss how the spectral profiles
and the lineshapes of Raman excitations critically depend on the pump
excitation regime. In particular, we show that in the large light-matter

approximate $(s,t)$-mincut (equivalently $(s,t)$-maxflow) algorithms in
undirected graphs to obtain near-linear time approximation algorithms for
several cut problems. Informally, for any $\alpha\geq 1$, an $\alpha$-fair
$(s,t)$-cut is an $(s,t)$-cut such that there exists an $(s,t)$-flow that uses
$1/\alpha$ fraction of the capacity of \emph{every} edge in the cut. (So, any
$\alpha$-fair cut is also an $\alpha$-approximate mincut, but not vice-versa.)
We give an algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)$-fair $(s,t)$-cut in
$\tilde{O}(m)$-time, thereby matching the best runtime for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate $(s,t)$-mincut [Peng, SODA '16]. We then demonstrate
the power of this approach by showing that this result almost immediately leads
to several applications:
  - the first nearly-linear time $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that
computes all-pairs maxflow values (by constructing an approximate Gomory-Hu
tree). Prior to our work, such a result was not known even for the special case
of Steiner mincut [Dinitz and Vainstein, STOC '94; Cole and Hariharan, STOC

computing $(1+\epsilon)$-approximations for all-pairs maxflow values (again via
an approximate Gomory-Hu tree) in unweighted graphs;
  - the first near-linear time expander decomposition algorithm that works even

stochastic problems (TSSP) with a large number of scenarios. The main idea
behind the Benders decomposition is to solve a large problem by replacing the
values of the second-stage subproblems with individual variables, and
progressively forcing those variables to reach the optimal value of the
subproblems, dynamically inserting additional valid constraints, known as
Benders cuts. Most traditional implementations add a cut for each scenario
(multi-cut) or a single-cut that includes all scenarios. In this paper we
present a novel Benders adaptive-cuts method, where the Benders cuts are
aggregated according to a partition of the scenarios, which is dynamically
refined using the LP-dual information of the subproblems. This scenario
aggregation/disaggregation is based on the Generalized Adaptive Partitioning
Method (GAPM), which has been successfully applied to TSSPs. We formalize this
hybridization of Benders decomposition and the GAPM, by providing sufficient
conditions under which an optimal solution of the deterministic equivalent can
be obtained in a finite number of iterations. Our new method can be interpreted
as a compromise between the Benders single-cuts and multi-cuts methods, drawing
on the advantages of both sides, by rendering the initial iterations faster (as
for the single-cuts Benders) and ensuring the overall faster convergence (as
for the multi-cuts Benders). Computational experiments on three TSSPs validate
these statements, showing that the new method outperforms the other
implementations of Benders method, as well as other standard methods for
solving TSSPs, in particular when the number of scenarios is very large.

causal inferences using observational data from multiple data sources. For
example, in healthcare, learning from electronic health records contained in
different hospitals is desirable but difficult due to heterogeneity in patient
case mix, differences in treatment guidelines, and data privacy regulations
that preclude individual patient data from being pooled. Motivated to overcome
these issues, we develop a federated causal inference framework. We devise a
doubly robust estimator of the mean potential outcome in a target population
and show that it is consistent even when some models are misspecified. To
enable real-world use, our proposed algorithm is privacy-preserving (requiring
only summary statistics to be shared between hospitals) and
communication-efficient (requiring only one round of communication between
hospitals). We implement our causal estimation and inference procedure to
investigate the quality of hospital care provided by a diverse set of 51
candidate Cardiac Centers of Excellence, as measured by 30-day mortality and
length of stay for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients. We find that our
proposed federated global estimator improves the precision of treatment effect
estimates by 59% to 91% compared to using data from the target hospital alone.
This precision gain results in qualitatively different conclusions about the
estimated effect of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to
medical management (MM) in 63% (32 of 51) of hospitals. We find that hospitals
rarely excel in both PCI and MM, which highlights the importance of assessing

  efficient CNN retraining on edge devices",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the increased deployment of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on edge
devices, the uncertainty of the observed data distribution upon deployment has
led researchers to to utilise large and extensive datasets such as ILSVRC'12 to
train CNNs. Consequently, it is likely that the observed data distribution upon
deployment is a subset of the training data distribution. In such cases, not
adapting a network to the observed data distribution can cause performance
degradation due to negative transfer and alleviating this is the focus of
Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA). Current works targeting PDA do not focus on
performing the domain adaptation on an edge device, adapting to a changing
target distribution or reducing the cost of deploying the adapted network. This
work proposes a novel PDA methodology that targets all of these directions and
opens avenues for on-device PDA. LoCO-PDA adapts a deployed network to the
observed data distribution by enabling it to be retrained on an edge device.
Across subsets of the ILSVRC12 dataset, LoCO-PDA improves classification
accuracy by 3.04pp on average while achieving up to 15.1x reduction in
retraining memory consumption and 2.07x improvement in inference latency on the

Hypoconvex functions are smooth nonconvex functions whose curvature is bounded

rates improve and extend the existing analysis for smooth nonconvex functions
with $L$-Lipschitz gradient (which corresponds to the case $\mu=-L$), and
smoothly interpolates between that class and the class of smooth convex

Control (DLMPC) for large-scale linear systems; DLMPC is a scalable closed-loop
MPC scheme in which subsystems need only exchange local information in order to
synthesize and implement local controllers. In this paper, we provide recursive

System Level Synthesis framework to express the maximal positive robust
invariant set for the closed-loop system and its corresponding Lyapunov
function, both in terms of the closed-loop system responses. We use the
invariant set as the terminal set for DLMPC, and show that this guarantees
feasibility with minimal conservatism. We use the Lyapunov function as the
terminal cost, and show that this guarantees stability. We provide fully
distributed and localized algorithms to compute the terminal set offline, and
also provide necessary additions to the online DLMPC algorithm to accommodate
coupled terminal constraint and cost. In all algorithms, only local information
exchanges are necessary, and computational complexity is independent of the
global system size -- we demonstrate this analytically and experimentally. This
is the first distributed MPC approach that provides minimally conservative yet
fully distributed guarantees for recursive feasibility and asymptotic
stability, for both nominal and robust settings.

encapsulates all shared state between threads. Monitors can be classified as
being either implicit or explicit depending on the primitives they provide.
Implicit monitors are much easier to program but typically not as efficient. To
address this gap, there has been recent research on automatically synthesizing
explicit-signal monitors from an implicit specification, but prior work does
not exploit all paralellization opportunities due to the use of a single lock
for the entire monitor. This paper presents a new technique for synthesizing
fine-grained explicit-synchronization protocols from implicit monitors. Our
method is based on two key innovations: First, we present a new static analysis
for inferring safe interleavings that allow violating mutual exclusion of
monitor operations without changing its semantics. Second, we use the results
of this static analysis to generate a MaxSAT instance whose models correspond
to correct-by-construction synchronization protocols. We have implemented our
approach in a tool called Cortado and evaluate it on monitors that contain
parallelization opportunities. Our evaluation shows that Cortado can synthesize
synchronization policies that are competitive with, or even better than,
expert-written ones on these benchmarks.

by a new decision analysis approach for functional regression that extracts the
critical windows of susceptibility and guides the model interpretations. These
tools help to identify and address broad limitations with the interpretability
of functional regression models. Simulation studies demonstrate more accurate
point estimation, more precise uncertainty quantification, and far superior

(small) polarons. We recently developed an ab initio approach based on
canonical transformations to efficiently compute the formation and energetics
of small polarons[1]. A different approach based on a Landau-Pekar energy
functional has been proposed in the recent literature [2,3]. In this work, we
analyze and compare these two methods in detail. We show that the small polaron
energy is identical in the two formalisms when using the same polaron wave
function. We also show that our canonical transformation formalism can predict
polaron band structures and can properly treat zero- and finite-temperature
lattice vibration effects, although at present using a fixed polaron wave
function. Conversely, the energy functional approach can compute the polaron
wave function, but as we show here it neglects lattice vibrations and cannot
address polaron self-localization and thermal band narrowing. Taken together,
this work relates two different methods developed recently to study polarons
from first-principles, highlighting their merits and shortcomings and
discussing them both in a unified formalism.

diversity, these planets also display dramatic signatures of intra-system
uniformity in their masses, radii, and orbital spacings. Although the details
of their formation and early evolution are poorly known, sub-Jovian planets are
expected to emerge from their natal nebulae as multi-resonant chains, owing to
planet-disk interactions. Within the context of this scenario, the
architectures of observed exoplanet systems can be broadly replicated if
resonances are disrupted through post-nebular dynamical instabilities. Here, we
generate an ad-hoc sample of resonant chains and use a suite of N-body

mass uniformity in a way that is consistent with the data. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that primordial mass uniformity, motivated by the sample of

find that almost all collisions lead to perfect mergers, but some form of

practice, database objects are updated, added, and removed from databases
continuously which makes previous results stale. Running batch algorithms is
infeasible in such scenarios as it would incur a significant overhead if

  Framework",,,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  On-demand and resource reservation pricing models have been widely used in
cloud computing, catering to different user requirements. Nevertheless, in
Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), as the edge has limited resources compared
to the cloud, on-demand users may not get their jobs served on time, or at all,
if too many resources were reserved by reservation plan users. Concurrently,
reservation plan users may possess excess un-utilized quota. To optimize this
resource mismatch scenario, we propose a Sharing Quota Model (SQM) where
reservation plan users can re-sell unused resource quota to on-demand users,
with the mobile network operator (MNO) taking a commission. To analyze the
user's aggregate behavior at equilibrium and investigate the MNO's incentive of
allowing re-selling, we formulate a 3-stage non-cooperative Stackelberg Game.
Solving this game, we characterize the optimal strategies of buyers and
re-sellers. We show that on aggregate, users' optimal strategies give rise to 4
disjoint regions, dependent on the MNO's prices and supply levels. Based on
this, we characterise the MNO's optimal prices for on-demand users. Numerical
results show that having both the sharing and on-demand pool gives the MNO an
optimal revenue when the on-demand pool's supply is low, and when the MNO's
commission is low.

graph-structured data. Many research works focus on developing tools such as
Graph Fourier transforms (GFT), filters, and neural network models to handle
graph signals. Such approaches have successfully taken care of ``signal

``graph signals'' themselves. Although there are characterizations of graph
signals using the notion of bandwidth derived from GFT, we want to argue here
that graph signals may contain hidden geometric information of the network,

Existing works address this problem by explicitly increasing inter-class
separability and intra-class similarity, whether by constructing positive and
negative pairs for contrastive learning or posing tighter class separating
margins. These methods do not exploit the similarity between different classes
as they adhere to i.i.d. assumption in data. In this paper, we embrace the
real-world data distribution setting that some classes share semantic overlaps
due to their similar appearances or concepts. Regarding this hypothesis, we
propose a novel regularization to improve discriminative learning. We first
calibrate the estimated highest likelihood of one sample based on its
semantically neighboring classes, then encourage the overall likelihood
predictions to be deterministic by imposing an adaptive exponential penalty. As
the gradient of the proposed method is roughly proportional to the uncertainty
of the predicted likelihoods, we name it adaptive discriminative regularization
(ADR), trained along with a standard cross entropy loss in classification.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can yield consistent and non-trivial
performance improvements in a variety of visual classification tasks (over 10
benchmarks). Furthermore, we find it is robust to long-tailed and noisy label
data distribution. Its flexible design enables its compatibility with
mainstream classification architectures and losses.

is of high importance for designing human-centered driver-vehicle interaction
systems and to ultimately help build a safer driving experience. However,
driver's state, including stress level and workload, are psychological
constructs that cannot be measured on their own and should be estimated through
sensor measurements such as psychophysiological measures. We propose using a
latent-variable state-space modeling framework for driver state analysis. By
using latent-variable state-space models, we model drivers' workload and stress
levels as latent variables estimated through multimodal human sensing data,
under the perturbations of the environment in a state-space format and in a
holistic manner. Through using a case study of multimodal driving data
collected from 11 participants, we first estimate the latent stress level and
workload of drivers from their heart rate, gaze measures, and intensity of
facial action units. We then show that external contextual elements such as the
number of vehicles as a proxy for traffic density and secondary task demands
may be associated with changes in driver's stress levels and workload. We also
show that different drivers may be impacted differently by the aforementioned
perturbations. We found out that drivers' latent states at previous timesteps
are highly associated with their current states. Additionally, we discuss the
utility of state-space models in analyzing the possible lag between the two
constructs of stress level and workload, which might be indicative of
information transmission between the different parts of the driver's
psychophysiology in the wild.

and treatments vary across subjects - is a fundamental task in causal
inference, playing a crucial role in optimal treatment allocation,
generalizability, subgroup effects, and more. Many flexible methods for
estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) have been proposed in
recent years, but questions surrounding optimality have remained largely
unanswered. In particular, a minimax theory of optimality has yet to be
developed, with the minimax rate of convergence and construction of
rate-optimal estimators remaining open problems. In this paper we derive the
minimax rate for CATE estimation, in a nonparametric model where distributional
components are Holder-smooth, and present a new local polynomial estimator,
giving high-level conditions under which it is minimax optimal. More
specifically, our minimax lower bound is derived via a localized version of the
method of fuzzy hypotheses, combining lower bound constructions for
nonparametric regression and functional estimation. Our proposed estimator can
be viewed as a local polynomial R-Learner, based on a localized modification of
higher-order influence function methods; it is shown to be minimax optimal
under a condition on how accurately the covariate distribution is estimated.
The minimax rate we find exhibits several interesting features, including a
non-standard elbow phenomenon and an unusual interpolation between
nonparametric regression and functional estimation rates. The latter quantifies
how the CATE, as an estimand, can be viewed as a regression/functional hybrid.
We conclude with some discussion of a few remaining open problems.

handle the discrepancy between patch-wise predictions which is a major issue
affecting the merging quality, we propose a new framework with the following
key components. First, we propose a geometry-aware feature fusion mechanism
that combines 3D geometric features with 2D image features to compensate for
the patch-wise discrepancy. Second, we employ the self-attention-based
transformer architecture to conduct a global aggregation of patch-wise

possible to effectively combine information from the high and low resolution
model runs? We propose a Bayesian emulation-calibration approach that
assimilates model outputs and observations at multiple resolutions. As a case
study for a riverine community in Pennsylvania, we demonstrate our approach
using the LISFLOOD-FP flood hazard model. The multiresolution approach results
in improved parameter inference over the single resolution approach in multiple

previous approaches fail to produce faithful descriptions. Though aggregating
2D features into point clouds may be beneficial, it introduces an extra
computational burden, especially in inference phases. In this study, we
investigate a cross-modal knowledge transfer using Transformer for 3D dense
captioning, X-Trans2Cap, to effectively boost the performance of single-modal
3D caption through knowledge distillation using a teacher-student framework. In
practice, during the training phase, the teacher network exploits auxiliary 2D
modality and guides the student network that only takes point clouds as input
through the feature consistency constraints. Owing to the well-designed
cross-modal feature fusion module and the feature alignment in the training
phase, X-Trans2Cap acquires rich appearance information embedded in 2D images
with ease. Thus, a more faithful caption can be generated only using point
clouds during the inference. Qualitative and quantitative results confirm that
X-Trans2Cap outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin, i.e.,

interferometry (VLBI) on the horizon, understanding similar polarized features
in the highly lensed structure known as the ""photon ring,"" where photons make
multiple half-orbits about the black hole before reaching the observer, will be
critical to analysis of future images. Recent work has indicated that this
image region may be depolarized relative to more direct emission. We expand
this observation by decomposing photon half-orbits in the EHT library of
simulated images of the \m{} accretion system and find that images of MAD
simulations show a relative depolarization of the photon ring attributable to
destructive interference of oppositely spiraling electric field vectors; this
antisymmetry, which arises purely from strong gravitational lensing, can
produce up to ${\sim}50\%$ depolarization in the photon ring region with
respect to the direct image. In systems that are not magnetically arrested and
with the exception of systems with high spin and ions and electrons of equal
temperature, we find that highly lensed indirect sub-images are almost
completely depolarized, causing a modest depolarization of the photon ring
region in the complete image. We predict that next-generation EHT observations
of \m{} polarization should jointly constrain the black hole spin and the
underlying emission and magnetic field geometry.

Furthermore, to alleviate the burden of communication during iterative

  In this paper, we target the lane detection system, which is an indispensable

design and realize the first physical backdoor attacks to such system. Our
attacks are comprehensively effective against different types of lane detection

(poison-annotation and clean-annotation) to generate poisoned samples. With
those samples, the trained lane detection model will be infected with the

using Instance Space Analysis (ISA). To do this, we extend recent work focused

between constraint violation and multi-objective fitness. Detailed evaluation

individual players in coalition games, have become a commonly used approach in
explainable machine learning to provide attributions to input features for
black-box machine learning models. A key attraction of Shapley values is that
they uniquely satisfy a very natural set of axiomatic properties. However,
extending the Shapley value to assigning attributions to interactions rather
than individual players, an interaction index, is non-trivial: as the natural
set of axioms for the original Shapley values, extended to the context of
interactions, no longer specify a unique interaction index. Many proposals thus
introduce additional less ''natural'' axioms, while sacrificing the key axiom
of efficiency, in order to obtain unique interaction indices. In this work,
rather than introduce additional conflicting axioms, we adopt the viewpoint of
Shapley values as coefficients of the most faithful linear approximation to the
pseudo-Boolean coalition game value function. By extending linear to
$\ell$-order polynomial approximations, we can then define the general family
of faithful interaction indices. We show that by additionally requiring the
faithful interaction indices to satisfy interaction-extensions of the standard
individual Shapley axioms (dummy, symmetry, linearity, and efficiency), we
obtain a unique Faithful Shapley Interaction index, which we denote Faith-Shap,
as a natural generalization of the Shapley value to interactions. We then

sequential fusion method that generates multi-scale dense voxel feature
representations, improving expressiveness in low point density regions. To
enhance multi-modal learning, we train directly with projected ground truth 3D
bounding box labels, avoiding noisy, detector-specific 2D predictions. Both DVF
and the multi-modal training approach can be applied to any voxel-based LiDAR
backbone. DVF ranks 3rd among published fusion methods on KITTI 3D car

electorate into a collection of districts each of which elects a
representative. A valid redistricting map must satisfy a collection of
constraints such as being compact, contiguous, and of almost equal population.
However, these imposed constraints are still loose enough to enable an enormous
ensemble of valid redistricting maps. This fact introduces a difficulty in
drawing redistricting maps and it also enables a partisan legislature to
possibly gerrymander by choosing a map which unfairly favors it. In this paper,
we introduce an interpretable and tractable distance measure over redistricting
maps which does not use election results and study its implications over the
ensemble of redistricting maps. Specifically, we define a central map which may
be considered as being ""most typical"" and give a rigorous justification for it
by showing that it mirrors the Kemeny ranking in a scenario where we have a
committee voting over a collection of redistricting maps to be drawn. We
include run-time and sample complexity analysis for our algorithms, including
some negative results which hold using any algorithm. We further study outlier
detection based on this distance measure. More precisely, we show gerrymandered
maps that lie very far away from our central maps in comparison to a large
ensemble of valid redistricting maps. Since our distance measure does not rely
on election results, this gives a significant advantage in gerrymandering
detection which is lacking in all previous methods.

task, we propose a target-driven grasping system that simultaneously considers
object relations and predicts 6-DoF grasp poses. A densely cluttered scene is
first formulated as a grasp graph with nodes representing object geometries in
the grasp coordinate frame and edges indicating spatial relations between the
objects. We design a Grasp Graph Neural Network (G2N2) that evaluates the grasp
graph and finds the most feasible 6-DoF grasp pose for a target object.
Additionally, we develop a shape completion-assisted grasp pose sampling method
that improves sample quality and consequently grasping efficiency. We compare
our method against several baselines in both simulated and real settings. In
real-world experiments with novel objects, our approach achieves a 77.78%
grasping accuracy in densely cluttered scenarios, surpassing the

removed impulsively at $t=0$. The resulting buoyancy force at the interface
acting from top to bottom is the seed of the baroclinic instability. Present
high precision computation enables one to capture the ensuing RTI triggered by
ultrasonic waves created at the interface.

stochastic demand processes with zero or constant lead times. While it is true
that in certain niche scenarios, uncertainty in lead times can be ignored, most
real-world scenarios exhibit stochasticity in lead times. These random
fluctuations can be caused due to uncertainty in arrival of raw materials at
the manufacturer's end, delay in transportation, an unforeseen surge in
demands, and switching to a different vendor, to name a few. Stochasticity in
lead times is known to severely degrade the performance in an inventory
management system, and it is only fair to abridge this gap in supply chain
system through a principled approach. Motivated by the recently introduced
delay-resolved deep Q-learning (DRDQN) algorithm, this paper develops a
reinforcement learning based paradigm for handling uncertainty in lead times
(\emph{action delay}). Through empirical evaluations, it is further shown that
the inventory management with uncertain lead times is not only equivalent to
that of delay in information sharing across multiple echelons
(\emph{observation delay}), a model trained to handle one kind of delay is
capable to handle delays of another kind without requiring to be retrained.
Finally, we apply the delay-resolved framework to scenarios comprising of
multiple products subjected to stochasticity in lead times, and elucidate how
the delay-resolved framework negates the effect of any delay to achieve
near-optimal performance.

or utility values.
  We propose two algorithms to sample a random group-fair ranking from the

samples ex-post group-fair rankings uniformly at random in time $O(k^2\ell)$,
where $\ell$ is the number of groups. Our second random walk-based algorithm
samples ex-post group-fair rankings from a distribution $\delta$-close to $D$
in total variation distance and has expected running time $O^*(k^2\ell^2)$,
when there is a sufficient gap between the given upper and lower bounds on the
group-wise representation. The former does exact sampling, but the latter runs
significantly faster on real-world data sets for larger values of $k$. We give

automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, which aims to achieve better
recognition performance by biasing the ASR system to particular context phrases
such as person names, music list, proper nouns, etc. Existing methods mainly
include contextual LM biasing and adding bias encoder into end-to-end ASR
models. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to do contextual biasing by
adding a contextual spelling correction model on top of the end-to-end ASR
system. We incorporate contextual information into a sequence-to-sequence
spelling correction model with a shared context encoder. Our proposed model
includes two different mechanisms: autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive
(NAR). We propose filtering algorithms to handle large-size context lists, and
performance balancing mechanisms to control the biasing degree of the model. We
demonstrate the proposed model is a general biasing solution which is
domain-insensitive and can be adopted in different scenarios. Experiments show
that the proposed method achieves as much as 51% relative word error rate (WER)
reduction over ASR system and outperforms traditional biasing methods. Compared
to the AR solution, the proposed NAR model reduces model size by 43.2% and
speeds up inference by 2.1 times.

materials show hysteresis loops, it is important to understand distinguishing
features (if any) in the same shown by either. Lately, there has been
substantial work that attempts to relate the area enclosed by the hysteresis
loop with the manner in which shear rate is varied in the cycle, in order to
infer thixotropic parameters of a material. In this work, we use the nonlinear
Giesekus model to study its response to the application of cyclic shear-rate
sweep. We find that this model produces each type of ualitatively similar
hysteresis loop that has hitherto been ascribed to thixotropic materials. We
also show that the area of the hysteresis loop for a viscoelastic material as a
function of sweep rate shows bell-shaped/bi-modal curves as has been observed
for thixotropic materials. This study illustrates that caution needs to be
exercised while attributing hysteresis loops and associated features observed
in a material exclusively to thixotropy. Another feature related to the
hysteresis loop is the occurrence of shear banding instability. We find that
viscoelastic hysteresis may not have any connection to shear banding
instability.

on two tightly-coupled and direct odometry subsystems: a VIO subsystem and a
LIO subsystem. The LIO subsystem registers raw points (instead of feature
points on e.g., edges or planes) of a new scan to an incrementally-built point
cloud map. The map points are additionally attached with image patches, which
are then used in the VIO subsystem to align a new image by minimizing the
direct photometric errors without extracting any visual features (e.g., ORB or
FAST corner features). To further improve the VIO robustness and accuracy, a
novel outlier rejection method is proposed to reject unstable map points that
lie on edges or are occluded in the image view. Experiments on both open data
sequences and our customized device data are conducted. The results show our
proposed system outperforms other counterparts and can handle challenging
environments at reduced computation cost. The system supports both multi-line
spinning LiDARs and emerging solid-state LiDARs with completely different

interlayer coupling plays a rather intriguing role. On the one hand, the weak
van der Waals interaction that holds the layers together endows these compounds
with quasi-2D properties, which might imply small interlayer effects on the
electronically active bands. On the other hand, the oft-witnessed differences
in electronic, optical, and magnetic behaviors of monolayers, bilayers, and
multilayers of the same compound must have as their microscopic origin the
detailed interlayer hopping parameters. Given the few experimental reports that
have attempted to explicitly extract these parameters, we employ soft-x-ray
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) to probe the interlayer
coupling in superconducting 2$H$-NbS$_2$. We visualize the S 3$p_z$ bands that
disperse with respect to the out-of-plane momentum and introduce a simple
tight-binding model to extract the interlayer hopping parameters. From
first-principles calculations, we clarify how atomic distances and the proper
accounting for screening via hybrid functionals influence these bands. The
knowledge of interlayer hopping parameters is particularly pertinent in
NbS$_2$, where recent experiments have uncovered fingerprints of

optimized for arbitrary upscaling factors. Our proposed method is the first to
treat arbitrary rescaling, both upscaling and downscaling, as one unified
process. Using joint optimization of both directions, the proposed model is
able to learn upscaling and downscaling simultaneously and achieve
bidirectional arbitrary image rescaling. It improves the performance of current
arbitrary upscaling models by a large margin while at the same time learns to
maintain visual perception quality in downscaled images. The proposed model is
further shown to be robust in cycle idempotence test, free of severe
degradations in reconstruction accuracy when the downscaling-to-upscaling cycle
is applied repetitively. This robustness is beneficial for image rescaling in
the wild when this cycle could be applied to one image for multiple times. It
also performs well on tests with arbitrary large scales and asymmetric scales,
even when the model is not trained with such tasks. Extensive experiments are

  Exclusion of Members","21 pages, 17 figures, 10 tables",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In membership inference attacks (MIAs), an adversary observes the predictions
of a model to determine whether a sample is part of the model's training data.
Existing MIA defenses conceal the presence of a target sample through strong
regularization, knowledge distillation, confidence masking, or differential
privacy.
  We propose MIAShield, a new MIA defense based on preemptive exclusion of
member samples instead of masking the presence of a member. The key insight in
MIAShield is weakening the strong membership signal that stems from the
presence of a target sample by preemptively excluding it at prediction time
without compromising model utility. To that end, we design and evaluate a suite
of preemptive exclusion oracles leveraging model-confidence, exact or
approximate sample signature, and learning-based exclusion of member data
points. To be practical, MIAShield splits a training data into disjoint subsets
and trains each subset to build an ensemble of models. The disjointedness of
subsets ensures that a target sample belongs to only one subset, which isolates
the sample to facilitate the preemptive exclusion goal.
  We evaluate MIAShield on three benchmark image classification datasets. We
show that MIAShield effectively mitigates membership inference (near random
guess) for a wide range of MIAs, achieves far better privacy-utility trade-off
compared with state-of-the-art defenses, and remains resilient against an
adaptive adversary.

order to eliminate the noise signals, two high-precision signal detectors,
square root of maximum eigenvalue times minimum eigenvalue (SR-MME) and
geometric mean (GM), are proposed. Compared to other detectors, SR-MME and GM
can achieve a high detection probability while maintaining extremely low false
alarm probability. Secondly, if the existence of emitters is determined by
detectors, we need to further confirm their number. Therefore, we perform
feature extraction on the the eigenvalue sequence of sample covariance matrix
to construct feature vector and innovatively propose a multi-layer neural
network (ML-NN). Additionally, the support vector machine (SVM), and naive
Bayesian classifier (NBC) are also designed. The simulation results show that
the machine learning-based methods can achieve good results in signal
classification, especially neural networks, which can always maintain the
classification accuracy above 70\% with massive MIMO receive array. Finally, we
analyze the classical signal classification methods, Akaike (AIC) and Minimum

for scenarios with massive MIMO arrays, and they also have much worse

Adversarial learning is therefore becoming a crucial task. We propose a new

theory. The idea is illustrated by creating a new adversarial attack that takes
into account the curvature of the data space. This new adversarial attack
called the two-step spectral attack is a piece-wise linear approximation of a
geodesic in the data space. The data space is treated as a (degenerate)
Riemannian manifold equipped with the pullback of the Fisher Information Metric
(FIM) of the neural network. In most cases, this metric is only semi-definite
and its kernel becomes a central object to study. A canonical foliation is
derived from this kernel. The curvature of transverse leaves gives the
appropriate correction to get a two-step approximation of the geodesic and
hence a new efficient adversarial attack. The method is first illustrated on a
2D toy example in order to visualize the neural network foliation and the
corresponding attacks. Next, experiments on the MNIST dataset with the proposed
technique and a state of the art attack presented in Zhao et al. (2019) are

progress linked to the rise of deep learning, but this effect was slower as it
comes to the downstream task of driver behavior understanding. Understanding
the situation inside the vehicle cabin is essential for Advanced Driving
Assistant System (ADAS) as it enables identifying distraction, predicting
driver's intent and leads to more convenient human-vehicle interaction. At the
same time, driver observation systems face substantial obstacles as they need
to capture different granularities of driver states, while the complexity of
such secondary activities grows with the rising automation and increased driver
freedom. Furthermore, a model is rarely deployed under conditions identical to
the ones in the training set, as sensor placements and types vary from vehicle
to vehicle, constituting a substantial obstacle for real-life deployment of
data-driven models. In this work, we present a novel vision-based framework for
recognizing secondary driver behaviours based on visual transformers and an
additional augmented feature distribution calibration module. This module
operates in the latent feature-space enriching and diversifying the training

Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are convenient owning to its ease of

biometric authentication systems, and the advent of remote PPG (rPPG) enables
adversaries to acquire PPG signals through restoration. While potentially
dangerous, rPPG-based attacks are overlooked because existing methods require
the victim's PPG signals. This paper proposes a novel spoofing attack approach
that uses the waveforms of rPPG signals extracted from video clips to fool the

addresses this limitation and studies the spatial distributions of the
photophysical dynamic parameters controlling the local surface photochemistry
on a plasmonic nanocrystal. We found that the generation of energetic electrons
and holes in small plasmonic nanocrystals with complex shapes is strongly
position-dependent and anisotropic, whereas the phototemperature across the
nanocrystal surface is nearly uniform. Our formalism includes three mechanisms
for the generation of excited carriers: the Drude process, the surface-assisted
generation of hot-electrons in the sp-band, and the excitation of interband
d-holes. Our computations show that the hot-carrier generation originating from
these mechanisms reflects the internal structure of hot spots in nanocrystals
with complex shapes. The injection of energetic carriers and increased surface
phototemperature are driving forces for photocatalytic and photo-growth
processes on the surface of plasmonic nanostructures. Therefore, developing a
consistent microscopic theory of such processes is necessary for designing
efficient nanoantennas for photocatalytic applications.

  unsupervised remote sensing change detection with heterogeneous sensors",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the context of Earth observation, the detection of changes is performed
from multitemporal images acquired by sensors with possibly different spatial
and/or spectral resolutions or even different modalities (e.g. optical, radar).
Even limiting to the optical modality, this task has proved to be challenging
as soon as the sensors have different spatial and/or spectral resolutions. This
paper proposes a novel unsupervised change detection method dedicated to images
acquired with such so-called heterogeneous optical sensors. This method
capitalizes on recent advances which frame the change detection problem into a
robust fusion framework. More precisely, we show that a deep adversarial
network designed and trained beforehand to fuse a pair of multiband optical
images can be easily complemented by a network with the same architecture to
perform change detection. The resulting overall architecture itself follows an
adversarial strategy where the fusion network and the additional network are
interpreted as essential building blocks of a generator. A comparison with
state-of-the-art change detection methods demonstrates the versatility and the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  Perturbation","Accepted at USENIX Security '23",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the problem of learning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
with Differential Privacy (DP). We propose a novel differentially private GNN
based on Aggregation Perturbation (GAP), which adds stochastic noise to the
GNN's aggregation function to statistically obfuscate the presence of a single
edge (edge-level privacy) or a single node and all its adjacent edges
(node-level privacy). Tailored to the specifics of private learning, GAP's new
architecture is composed of three separate modules: (i) the encoder module,
where we learn private node embeddings without relying on the edge information;
(ii) the aggregation module, where we compute noisy aggregated node embeddings
based on the graph structure; and (iii) the classification module, where we
train a neural network on the private aggregations for node classification
without further querying the graph edges. GAP's major advantage over previous
approaches is that it can benefit from multi-hop neighborhood aggregations, and
guarantees both edge-level and node-level DP not only for training, but also at
inference with no additional costs beyond the training's privacy budget. We
analyze GAP's formal privacy guarantees using R\'enyi DP and conduct empirical
experiments over three real-world graph datasets. We demonstrate that GAP
offers significantly better accuracy-privacy trade-offs than state-of-the-art
DP-GNN approaches and naive MLP-based baselines. Our code is publicly available

3D reconstruction algorithms which exploit spatial regularity of natural scenes

computational and memory complexity proportional to the number of recorded
photons. This complexity hinders their real-time deployment on modern lidar

computationally and statistically. Convex approaches have been proven
statistically optimal but suffer from high computational costs, especially
since robust loss functions are usually non-smooth. More recently,
computationally fast non-convex approaches via sub-gradient descent are
proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a statistically consistent
estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Riemannian sub-gradient (RsGrad) algorithm which is not only computationally
efficient with linear convergence but also is statistically optimal, be the
noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed. Convergence theory is established for a general
framework and specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss, and quantile
loss are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals
a surprising phenomenon of dual-phase convergence. In phase one, RsGrad behaves
as in a typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying
stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal
estimator which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly,
during phase two, RsGrad converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth and
strongly convex objective function and thus a constant stepsize suffices.
Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to
the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth.
Lastly, RsGrad is applicable for low-rank tensor estimation under heavy-tailed
noise where a statistically optimal rate is attainable with the same phenomenon
of dual-phase convergence, and a novel shrinkage-based second-order moment
method is guaranteed to deliver a warm initialization. Numerical simulations
confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the superiority of RsGrad over
prior methods.

decomposed into contributions of the individual terms of the Hamiltonian, and
their ratios to the total PY rotational energy are calculated. Except for light
or weakly-deformed nuclei, the ratios of the individual terms of the

kinetic energies are large and close to the rigid-rotor values, although those
of central forces are sizable. For light or weakly-deformed nuclei, the ratios
significantly depend on nuclei and deformation. The contributions of noncentral
forces are not negligible. Regardless of nuclides, the attractive forces
decrease the moment-of-inertia, and the repulsive forces increase it. A general
formula for the PY rotational energy is derived, which suggests that
higher-order terms of the cumulant expansion play roles in the rotational
energy and the moment-of-inertia for light or weakly-deformed nuclei.

also compare observable signatures of 4D EGB Bardeen black holes with those of
the Schwarzschild black holes. The angular position $\theta_\infty$ for Sgr A*

Schwarzschild black hole, respectively, can reach up to $2.3789~\mu$as and
$0.11695~\mu$as for Sgr A* , $1.84084~\mu$as and $0.0905~\mu$as for M87*. On
the other hand, the relative magnification $\in$ (4.65751,\; 6.82173).
Considering twenty-two massive central black holes as lens, we also estimate
the time delay $\Delta T^s_{2,1}$ between the first and second relativistic

large information length and large minimum distance. A class of codes is said
to be asymptotically good if there exists a positive real $\delta$ such that,
for any positive integer $N$ we can find a code in the class with code length
greater than $N$, and with both the rate and the relative minimum distance
greater than $\delta$. The linear codes over any finite field are
asymptotically good. More interestingly, the (asymptotic) GV-bound is a phase
transition point for the linear codes; i.e., asymptotically speaking, the
parameters of most linear codes attain the GV-bound. It is a long-standing open
question: whether or not the cyclic codes over a finite field (which are an
important class of codes) are asymptotically good? However, from a long time
ago the quasi-cyclic codes of index $2$ were proved to be asymptotically good.
This chapter consists of some of our studies on the asymptotic properties of
several classes of quasi-group codes. We'll explain the studies in a consistent
and self-contained style. We begin with the classical results on linear codes.
In many cases we consider the quasi-group codes over finite abelian groups
(including the cyclic case as a subcase of course), and study their asymptotic
properties along two directions: (1) the order of the group (the coindex) is
fixed while the index is going to infinity; (2) the index is small while the
order of the group (the coindex) is going to infinity. Finally we describe the
story on dihedral codes. The dihedral groups are non-abelian but near to cyclic
groups (they have cyclic subgroups of index $2$). The asymptotic goodness of
binary dihedral codes was obtained in the beginning of this century, and
extended to the general dihedral codes recently.

Yet, we find that the crux of the unsatisfactory pseudo masks is the binary
cross-entropy loss (BCE) widely used in CAM. Specifically, due to the
sum-over-class pooling nature of BCE, each pixel in CAM may be responsive to
multiple classes co-occurring in the same receptive field. As a result, given a
class, its hot CAM pixels may wrongly invade the area belonging to other
classes, or the non-hot ones may be actually a part of the class. To this end,
we introduce an embarrassingly simple yet surprisingly effective method:
Reactivating the converged CAM with BCE by using softmax cross-entropy loss
(SCE), dubbed \textbf{ReCAM}. Given an image, we use CAM to extract the feature
pixels of each single class, and use them with the class label to learn another
fully-connected layer (after the backbone) with SCE. Once converged, we extract
ReCAM in the same way as in CAM. Thanks to the contrastive nature of SCE, the
pixel response is disentangled into different classes and hence less mask
ambiguity is expected. The evaluation on both PASCAL VOC and MS~COCO shows that
ReCAM not only generates high-quality masks, but also supports plug-and-play in
any CAM variant with little overhead.

isolation from magnetic noise and potentially long coherence times. However,
their weak coupling to external stimuli makes them hard to integrate into
circuit-QED architectures, the leading technology for solid-state quantum
processors. Here, we study the coupling of $^{173}$Yb(III) nuclear spin states
in an [Yb(trensal)] molecule to superconducting cavities. Experiments have been
performed on magnetically diluted single crystals placed on the inductors of
lumped-element $LC$ superconducting resonators with characteristic frequencies
spanning the range of nuclear and electronic spin transitions. We achieve a
high cooperative coupling to all electronic and most nuclear
[$^{173}$Yb(trensal)] spin transitions. This result is a big leap towards the
implementation of qudit protocols with molecular spins using a hybrid
architecture.

method specifically formulated to deal with tensor data. Precisely, the goal of
MDA is to find mode-specific projections that optimally separate tensor data
from different classes. However, to solve this task, standard MDA methods use
alternating optimization heuristics involving the computation of a succession
of tensor-matrix products. Such approaches are most of the time difficult to
solve and not natural, highligthing the difficulty to formulate this problem in
fully tensor form. In this paper, we propose to solve multilinear discriminant
analysis (MDA) by using the concept of transform domain (TD) recently proposed
in \cite{Kilmer2011}. We show here that moving MDA to this specific transform
domain make its resolution easier and more natural. More precisely, each
frontal face of the transformed tensor is processed independently to build a
separate optimization sub-problems easier to solve. Next, the obtained
solutions are converted into projective tensors by inverse transform. By
considering a large number of experiments, we show the effectiveness of our
approach with respect to existing MDA methods.

makes them an efficient solution for improving power quality and reliability.
This property of MG is very much beneficial for remote and undeveloped areas in
progressing countries. Moreover, ICT technology has led to the development of
Smart Standalone Microgrids (SSMG), which are inundated with a plethora of
sensors. This allows multiple microgrids to be controlled in a coordinated way
to achieve self-sufficiency in power. In such systems, there is much
interdependency between various power, control and communication parameters.
Owing to these developments, the control of physical variables like voltage get
affected by cyber parameters like, communication structure, delay and link
loss. Moreover, due to isolation from main grid and abundance of renewable
power generation units like solar PV, the inertia of these standalone grids is
reduced greatly and calls for advanced control algorithms which use an
abundance of sensors. Hence, the stability of these systems is greatly affected
by sensor failures apart from many physical parameters like load and
environmental conditions. In this thesis, a generic structure of an AC-DC
hybrid microgrid is considered which is subdivided into various AC and DC
counterparts. The AC and DC SSMGs are separately modeled and control solutions
are proposed to improve their stability. The first two contributions propose
adaptive control schemes on the primary level of control in the hybrid
microgrid. Their function is to provide fast and stable parameters regulation
in the DCSSMG when subjected to atmospheric changes along with faults in sensor
readings. The third and fourth contributions cater to development of
coordinated control cyber physical frameworks in the ACSSMG to handle the
presence of simultaneous disturbances from both cyber/physical domains.

its simplicity and practicality. However, there is one main drawback: it is
time-consuming due to its high computational complexity. Herein, a density
peaks clustering algorithm with sparse search and K-d tree is developed to
solve this problem. Firstly, a sparse distance matrix is calculated by using
K-d tree to replace the original full rank distance matrix, so as to accelerate
the calculation of local density. Secondly, a sparse search strategy is
proposed to accelerate the computation of relative-separation with the
intersection between the set of $k$ nearest neighbors and the set consisting of
the data points with larger local density for any data point. Furthermore, a
second-order difference method for decision values is adopted to determine the
cluster centers adaptively. Finally, experiments are carried out on datasets
with different distribution characteristics, by comparing with other six
state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. It is proved that the algorithm can
effectively reduce the computational complexity of the original DPC from
$O(n^2K)$ to $O(n(n^{1-1/K}+k))$. Especially for larger datasets, the
efficiency is elevated more remarkably. Moreover, the clustering accuracy is
also improved to a certain extent. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
overall performance of the newly proposed algorithm is excellent.

applications related to turbulence, including flow control, optimization,
turbulent features reproduction as well as turbulence prediction and modeling.
With this study we aim to assess the capability of these networks to reproduce
the temporal evolution of a minimal turbulent channel flow. We first obtain a
data-driven model based on a modal decomposition in the Fourier domain (which
we denote as FFT-POD) of the time series sampled from the flow. This particular
case of turbulent flow allows us to accurately simulate the most relevant
coherent structures close to the wall. Long-short-term-memory (LSTM) networks
and a Koopman-based framework (KNF) are trained to predict the temporal
dynamics of the minimal-channel-flow modes. Tests with different configurations
highlight the limits of the KNF method compared to the LSTM, given the
complexity of the flow under study. Long-term prediction for LSTM show
excellent agreement from the statistical point of view, with errors below 2%
for the best models with respect to the reference. Furthermore, the analysis of
the chaotic behaviour through the use of the Lyapunov exponents and of the
dynamic behaviour through Poincar\'e maps emphasizes the ability of the LSTM to
reproduce the temporal dynamics of turbulence. Alternative reduced-order models
(ROMs), based on the identification of different turbulent structures, are
explored and they continue to show a good potential in predicting the temporal
dynamics of the minimal channel.

kinodynamic planning. Tree-based planning approaches, such as rapidly exploring
random tree (RRT), are the dominant approach to finding globally optimal plans
in continuous state-space motion planning. Central to these approaches is
tree-expansion, the procedure in which new nodes are added into an
ever-expanding tree. We study the kinodynamic variants of tree-based planning,
where we have known system dynamics and kinematic constraints. In the interest
of quickly selecting nodes to connect newly sampled coordinates, existing
methods typically cannot optimise to find nodes which have low cost to
transition to sampled coordinates. Instead they use metrics like Euclidean
distance between coordinates as a heuristic for selecting candidate nodes to
connect to the search tree. We propose L4KDE to address this issue. L4KDE uses
a neural network to predict transition costs between queried states, which can
be efficiently computed in batch, providing much higher quality estimates of
transition cost compared to commonly used heuristics while maintaining
almost-surely asymptotic optimality guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the
significant performance improvement provided by L4KDE on a variety of
challenging system dynamics, with the ability to generalise across different
instances of the same model class, and in conjunction with a suite of modern
tree-based motion planners.

extends to the hyperbolic plane an observation of Sykes and Essam in 1964.
  It follows that $p_u (G)+p_c (G_*)=p_u(G_*)+p_c(G)=1$, where $G_*$ denotes
the matching graph of $G$. In particular, $p_u(G)+p_c(G)\ge 1$ and hence, when

the more general case of nonseparable states of light, in which two or more

Importantly, classical nonseparable states of light are mathematically analogue
to quantum entangled states. Such similarity has hatched attractive studies in

nonseparable classical states of light are still treated in a fragmented

in using a single distorted configuration obtained from the vibrational

sequential consideration of both corrections systematically improves the band
gaps, reaching a mean absolute error of 0.17 eV with respect to experimental

task at each WD are dynamically determined based on the instantaneous channel
conditions (to capture the transmission opportunities) and the instantaneous
WD-QSI and MEC-QSI (to capture the dynamic urgency of the tasks) to minimize
the average latency of the DNN tasks. The joint optimization can be formulated
as an ergodic Markov decision process (MDP), in which the optimality condition
is characterized by a centralized Bellman equation. However, the brute force
solution of the MDP is not viable due to the curse of dimensionality as well as
the requirement for knowledge of the global state information. To overcome
these issues, we first decompose the MDP into multiple lower dimensional
sub-MDPs, each of which can be associated with a WD or the MEC server. Next, we
further develop a parametric online Q-learning algorithm, so that each sub-MDP
is solved locally at its associated WD or the MEC server. The proposed solution

offloading and the DNN task partitioning can be determined based on the local

Additionally, no prior knowledge of the distribution of the DNN task arrivals

explore systems that can be continuously tuned across these transitions. Here,
we demonstrate such tunability and the electronic correlation effects in
triangular moir\'e superlattices formed between trilayer MoTe$_2$ and monolayer
WSe$_2$ (3L-MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$). Through electric transport measurements, we
firmly establish the Pomeranchuk effect observed at half filling of the first
moir\'e subband, where increasing temperature paradoxically enhances charge
localization. The system simultaneously exhibits the characteristic of a Fermi
liquid with strongly renormalized effective mass, suggesting a correlated metal
state. The state is highly susceptible to out-of-plane electric and magnetic
fields, which induce a Lifshitz transition and a metal-insulator transition
(MIT), respectively. It enables identification of a tricritical point in the
quantum phase diagram at the base temperature. We explain the Lifshitz
transition in terms of interlayer charge transfer by applying the vertical
electric field, which leads to the emergence of a new Fermi surface and
immediate suppression of the Pomeranchuk effect. The existence of quantum
criticality in the magnetic filed induced MIT is supported by scaling behaviors
of the resistance. Our work shows the 3L-MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ lies in the vicinity
to the MIT point of the triangular lattice Hubbard model, rendering it a unique

double-$\beta$ decay of $^{100}$Mo, with and without the emission of two
neutrinos, is performed in the framework of the nuclear shell model. This task
is accomplished starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential, then the
effective shell-model Hamiltonian and decay operators are derived within the
many-body perturbation theory. The exotic features which characterize the
structure of Mo isotopes -- such as shape coexistence and triaxiality softness
-- push the shell-model computational problem beyond its present limits, making
it necessary to truncate the model space. This has been done with the goal to
preserve as much as possible the role of the rejected degrees of freedom in an
effective approach that has been introduced and tested in previous studies.
This procedure is grounded on the analysis of the effective single-particle
energies of a large-scale shell-model Hamiltonian, that leads to a truncation
of the number of the orbitals belonging to the model space. Then, the original
Hamiltonian generates a new one by way of a unitary transformation onto the
reduced model space, to retain effectively the role of the excluded
single-particle orbitals. The predictivity of our calculation of the nuclear
matrix element for the neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay of $^{100}$Mo is
supported by the comparison with experiment of the calculated spectra,
electromagnetic transition strengths, Gamow-Teller transition strengths and the
two-neutrino double-beta nuclear matrix elements.

processes, from cascading failures to epidemic spreading. Standard percolation
assumes short-range interactions, implying that nodes can merge into clusters
only if they are nearest-neighbors. Cumulative Merging Percolation (CMP) is an
new percolation process that assumes long-range interactions, such that nodes
can merge into clusters even if they are topologically distant. Hence in CMP
percolation clusters do not coincide with the topological connected components
of the network. Previous work has shown that a specific formulation of CMP
features peculiar mechanisms for the formation of the giant cluster, and allows
to model different network dynamics such as recurrent epidemic processes. Here
we develop a more general formulation of CMP in terms of the functional form of
the cluster interaction range, showing an even richer phase transition scenario
with competition of different mechanisms resulting in crossover phenomena. Our
analytic predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations.

are widely seen as being short-range. However, the rigorous mathematical
analysis of this type of model turns out to be extremely difficult, in general,

contrast, mean-field models come from different approximations or Ans\""{a}tze,
and are thus less realistic, in a sense, but are technically advantageous, by
allowing explicit computations while capturing surprisingly well many real
physical phenomena. Here, we establish a precise mathematical relation between
mean-field and short-range models, by using the long-range limit that is known
in the literature as the Kac limit. If both attractive and repulsive long-range
forces are present then it turns out that the limit mean-field model is not
necessarily what one traditionally guesses. One important innovation of our
study, in contrast with previous works on the subject, is the fact that we are
able to show the convergence of equilibrium states, i.e., of all correlation
functions. This paves the way for studying phase transitions, or at least
important fingerprints of them like strong correlations at long distances, for
models having interactions whose ranges are finite, but very large. It also
sheds a new light on mean-field models. Even on the level of pressures, our
results go considerably further than previous ones, by allowing, for instance,
a continuum of long-range interaction components, as well as very general
short-range Hamiltonians for the ""free"" part of the model.

TrustZone-agnostic hardware primitives available on commercially off-the-shelf
(COTS) platforms to restrict the privileges of the trusted OS. With ReZone, a
monolithic TEE is restructured and partitioned into multiple sandboxed domains
named zones, which have only access to private resources. We have fully
implemented ReZone for the i.MX 8MQuad EVK and integrated it with Android OS
and OP-TEE. We extensively evaluated ReZone using microbenchmarks and
real-world applications. ReZone can sustain popular applications like
DRM-protected video encoding with acceptable performance overheads. We have
surveyed 80 CVE vulnerability reports and estimate that ReZone could mitigate
86.84% of them.

xenon from materials that do not emanate radon and that fulfill ultra-high

materials were used. Especially, large-area oxygen-free copper fins with high
conductivity in a new design ensure efficient heat transfer. One bath-type

with a reduced diameter of 30 cm using liquid nitrogen to liquefy the xenon. A
model based on conservative assumptions such as film boiling on the nitrogen
side and film condensation on the xenon side was developed and applied to
caluclate the expected heat transfer for our design. We were able to
demonstrate an adjustable xenon liquefaction rate of up to 113 kg/h limited

a reward signal. This means that in situations of sparse rewards the agent has
to focus on exploration, in order to discover which action, or set of actions
leads to the reward. RL agents usually struggle with this. Exploration is the
focus of Quality-Diversity (QD) methods. In this thesis, we approach the
problem of sparse rewards with these algorithms, and in particular with Novelty
Search (NS). This is a method that only focuses on the diversity of the
possible policies behaviors. The first part of the thesis focuses on learning a
representation of the space in which the diversity of the policies is
evaluated. In this regard, we propose the TAXONS algorithm, a method that
learns a low-dimensional representation of the search space through an
AutoEncoder. While effective, TAXONS still requires information on when to
capture the observation used to learn said space. For this, we study multiple
ways, and in particular the signature transform, to encode information about
the whole trajectory of observations. The thesis continues with the
introduction of the SERENE algorithm, a method that can efficiently focus on
the interesting parts of the search space. This method separates the
exploration of the search space from the exploitation of the reward through a
two-alternating-steps approach. The exploration is performed through NS. Any
discovered reward is then locally exploited through emitters. The third and
final contribution combines TAXONS and SERENE into a single approach: STAX.
Throughout this thesis, we introduce methods that lower the amount of prior
information needed in sparse rewards settings. These contributions are a
promising step towards the development of methods that can autonomously explore
and find high-performance policies in a variety of sparse rewards settings.

the peculiar temperature dependence of HHG is a generic feature of Mott

standard tools to synthesize semantically meaningful mixtures of generated
samples. As the generator function is non-linear, commonly used linear
interpolations in the latent space do not yield the shortest paths in the
sample space, resulting in non-smooth interpolations. Recent work has therefore
equipped the latent space with a suitable metric to enforce shortest paths on
the manifold of generated samples. These are often, however, susceptible of
veering away from the manifold of real samples, resulting in smooth but
unrealistic generation that requires an additional method to assess the sample
quality along paths. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by construction,
measure the sample quality using its discriminator network. In this paper, we
establish that the discriminator can be used effectively to avoid regions of
low sample quality along shortest paths. By reusing the discriminator network
to modify the metric on the latent space, we propose a lightweight solution for
improved interpolations in pre-trained GANs.

is achieved by applying an electric potential difference in a composite
electrode structure embedded within the silicon bulk using MEMS fabrication
techniques. Since no gain-layer deactivation is expected with radiation damage,
such a structure is expected to withstand fluences of up to $10^{16} n_{eq}$.
Various geometries and biasing configurations are studied, within the
boundaries imposed by the fabrication process being considered. The effective
gain, the field in the sensor, the leakage current and breakdown conditions are
studied for cell sizes in the range of $6 - 15 \mu m$. Simulations show that
gains in excess of 10 can be achieved, and studies of the time structure of the
induced signals from a charge cloud deposited in the middle of the sensor show
that time resolutions similar to other sensors with internal gain can be
expected. Plans for the manufacture of a proof-of-concept sensor and for its

emission was observed during the late phase of the M9 complex event
SOL2010-02-012T11:25:00, described in a previous publication and was associated
with a secondary energy release, also observed in STEREO 304 {\AA} images:
there was no detectable soft X-ray emission. Triangulation of the STEREO images
allowed the identification of the surge with NRH sources near the central
meridian. The radio emission of the surge occurred in two phases and consisted
of two sources, one located near the base of the surge, apparently at or near
the site of energy release, and another in the upper part of the surge; these
were best visible in the frequency range of 445.0 to about 300MHz, whereas a
spectral component of different nature was observed at lower frequencies.
Sub-second time variations were detected in both sources during both phases,
with 0.2-0.3s a delay of the upper source with respect to the lower, suggesting
superluminal velocities. This effect can be explained if the emission of the
upper source was due to scattering of radiation from the source at the base of
the surge. In addition, the radio emission showed signs of pulsations and
spikes. We discuss possible emission mechanisms for the slow time variability
component of the lower radio source. Gyrosynchrotron emission reproduced fairly
well the characteristics of the observed total intensity spectrum at the start
of the second phase of the event, but failed to reproduce the high degree of
the observed circular polarization as well the spectra at other instances. On
the other hand, type IV-like plasma emission from the fundamental could explain
the high polarization and the fine structure in the dynamic spectrum; moreover,
it gives projected radio source positions on the plane of the sky, as seen from
STEREO-A, near the base of the surge. Taking everything into consideration, we
suggest type IV-like plasma emission with a low intensity gyrosynchrotron
component as the most plausible mechanism.

knowledge graphs (KGs), is a fundamental problem for constructing Web-scale
KGs. Over the course of its development, the label supervision has been
considered necessary for accurate alignments. Inspired by the recent progress
of self-supervised learning, we explore the extent to which we can get rid of
supervision for entity alignment. Commonly, the label information (positive
entity pairs) is used to supervise the process of pulling the aligned entities
in each positive pair closer. However, our theoretical analysis suggests that
the learning of entity alignment can actually benefit more from pushing
unlabeled negative pairs far away from each other than pulling labeled positive
pairs close. By leveraging this discovery, we develop the self-supervised
learning objective for entity alignment. We present SelfKG with efficient
strategies to optimize this objective for aligning entities without label
supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
SelfKG without supervision can match or achieve comparable results with
state-of-the-art supervised baselines. The performance of SelfKG suggests that
self-supervised learning offers great potential for entity alignment in KGs.

Andersen","A Bayesian Approach to CT Reconstruction with Uncertain Geometry","15 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Computed tomography is a method for synthesizing volumetric or
cross-sectional images of an object from a collection of projections. Popular
reconstruction methods for computed tomography are based on idealized models
and assumptions that may not be valid in practice. One such assumption is that
the exact projection geometry is known. The projection geometry describes the
relative location of the radiation source, object, and detector for each
projection. However, in practice, the geometric parameters used to describe the
position and orientation of the radiation source, object, and detector are
estimated quantities with uncertainty. A failure to accurately estimate the
geometry may lead to reconstructions with severe misalignment artifacts that
significantly decrease their scientific or diagnostic value. We propose a novel
reconstruction method that jointly estimates the reconstruction and the
projection geometry. The reconstruction method is based on a Bayesian approach
that yields a point estimate for the reconstruction and geometric parameters
and, in addition, provides valuable information regarding their uncertainty.
This is achieved by approximately sampling from the joint posterior
distribution of the reconstruction and projection geometry using a hierarchical
Gibbs sampler. Using real tomographic data, we demonstrate that the proposed
reconstruction method significantly reduces misalignment artifacts. Compared
with two commonly used alignment methods, our proposed method achieves
comparable or better results under challenging conditions.

870\mu$m) observations recover $123 \pm 73\%$, $60 \pm 15\%$ and $19 \pm 4\%$
respectively of the integrated 850$\mu$m flux density from SCUBA-2, indicating
that there may be additional sources below our SMA detection limit making up a
dense, protocluster core. The fourth 500$\mu$m riser was observed at a lower
frequency and so we cannot make a similar comparison. We estimate photometric
redshifts based on FIR/sub-mm colours, finding that 3/4 likely lie at $z \geq
2$. This fits with the interpretation that the 500$\mu$m riser selection
criterion selects both intrinsically red, individual galaxies at $z > 4$, and
multiple systems at more moderate redshifts, artificially reddened by the
effects of blending. We use the SCUBA-2 850$\mu$m maps to investigate the
environments of these 500$\mu$m risers. By constructing cumulative number
counts and estimating photometric redshifts for surrounding SCUBA-2 detections,
we find that one of our 500$\mu$m risers could plausibly reside in a $z \geq 2$

the CG equations are space averaged to obtain the analytical expression of the

dissipation rate in the simulations and with the classical estimates based on
the ""third-order"" law. Furthermore, we developed an anisotropic version of CG
that allows us to study the magnitude of the cascade rate along different

numerical data with moderate background magnetic field shows a weaker cascade
along the magnetic field than in the perpendicular plane, while an isotropic
cascade is recovered in the absence of a background field. The strength of the
CG approach is further revealed when considering the {\it local-in-space}

such a condition on the discretization step is not satisfied, which we refer to

modeling can provide complimentary guidance to the temporal dependencies
modeling. This paper develops an effective exemplar-consultation mechanism that
first measures the similarity between a frame and exemplary frames, and then
aggregates exemplary features based on the similarity weights. This is also an
efficient mechanism, as both similarity measurement and feature aggregation
require limited computations. Based on the exemplar-consultation mechanism, the
long-term dependencies can be captured by regarding historical frames as
exemplars, while the category-level modeling can be achieved by regarding
representative frames from a category as exemplars. Due to the complementarity

the internal structure of dry and water-rich rocky planets. This model provides
an estimation of the average density and core size of the planet and, with
them, its magnetic moment depending on whether it is tidally locked or not. Our
model estimates the thermodynamic variables as a function of pressure and
includes saltwater as a component of water-rich exoplanets. We have not used
the perfect layer differentiation approximation. We have validated our model
with those planets and satellites in the Solar system with similar
characteristics. The differences with the observed values in the internal
structure characteristics, mass, average density, moment of inertia factor, and
local Rossby number are remarkably low or even negligible. The estimated
magnetic moments are also very similar to the observed ones. We have applied
the model to the first 176 planets confirmed by the TESS, finding that, from an
astrobiological perspective TOI-700 d and TOI-2257 b are the most interesting

one out of $n$ options. Each option is drawn independently from a known
distribution. Instead of inspecting the options herself, P delegates the
information acquisition to a rational and self-interested agent A. After
inspection, A proposes one of the options, and P can accept or reject.
  Delegation is a classic setting in economic information design with many
prominent applications, but the computational problems are only poorly
understood. In this paper, we study a natural online variant of delegation, in
which the agent searches through the options in an online fashion. For each
option, he has to irrevocably decide if he wants to propose the current option
or discard it, before seeing information on the next option(s). How can we
design algorithms for P that approximate the utility of her best option in
hindsight?
  We show that in general P can obtain a $\Theta(1/n)$-approximation and extend
this result to ratios of $\Theta(k/n)$ in case (1) A has a lookahead of $k$
rounds, or (2) A can propose up to $k$ different options. We provide
fine-grained bounds independent of $n$ based on two parameters. If the ratio of
maximum and minimum utility for A is bounded by a factor $\alpha$, we obtain an
$\Omega(\log \log \alpha / \log \alpha)$-approximation algorithm, and we show
that this is best possible. Additionally, if P cannot distinguish options with
the same value for herself, we show that ratios polynomial in $1/\alpha$ cannot
be avoided. If the utilities of P and A for each option are related by a factor
$\beta$, we obtain an $\Omega(1/ \log \beta)$-approximation, where $O(\log \log
\beta/ \log \beta)$ is best possible.

However, such an exact labeling task is costly, especially when the

goes further, presenting a soft-label approach to AL on GNNs. Our key
innovations are: i) relaxed queries where a domain expert (oracle) only judges

identifying the exact class (a multi-class question), and ii) new criteria of

lately. For instance, Index-of-Max (IoM), a recent reported hashing technique,

feasibility to protect the ordered and fixed-length biometric template.
However, biometric templates are not always in the form of ordered and
fixed-length, rather it may be an unordered and variable size point set e.g.
fingerprint minutiae, which restricts the usage of the traditional hashing
technology. In this paper, we proposed a generalized version of IoM hashing

can be used. We demonstrate a realization using a well-known variable size
feature vector, fingerprint Minutia Cylinder-Code (MCC). The gIoM transforms
MCC into index domain to form indexing-based feature representation.
Consequently, the inversion of MCC from the transformed representation is
computational infeasible, thus to achieve non-invertibility while the
performance is preserved. Public fingerprint databases FVC2002 and FVC2004 are
employed for experiment as benchmark to demonstrate a fair comparison with

algorithm have the potential to detect up to 82.8% of the energy losses with

remarkable success in increasing the model capacity of large-scale language
models. However, MoE requires incorporating significantly more parameters than
the base model being extended. In this paper, we propose building a
parameter-efficient MoE architecture by sharing information among experts. We
adopt the matrix product operator (MPO, a tensor decomposition from quantum
many-body physics) to reconstruct the parameter matrix in the expert layer and
increase model capacity for pre-trained language models by sharing parameters
of the central tensor (containing the core information) among different experts
while enabling the specificity through the auxiliary tensors (complementing the
central tensor) of different experts. To address the unbalanced optimization
issue, we further design the gradient mask strategy for the MPO-based MoE
architecture. Extensive experiments based on T5 and GPT-2 show improved
performance and efficiency of the pre-trained language model (27.2x reduction
in total parameters for the superior model performance, compared with the
Switch Transformers). Our code is publicly available at

structures on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}[\![x]\!]$, where $ \mathfrak{g} $
is a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $
F $ of characteristic $ 0 $.
  We introduce the notion of a topological Manin pair $(L,
\mathfrak{g}[\![x]\!])$ and present their classification by relating them to
trace extensions of \( F[\![x]\!] \). Then we recall the classification of
topological doubles of Lie bialgebra structures on $\mathfrak{g}[\![x]\!]$ and
view the latter as a special case of the classification of Manin pairs.
  The classification of topological doubles states that up to some notion of
equivalence there are only three non-trivial doubles. It is proven that
topological Lie bialgebra structures on $\mathfrak{g}[\![x]\!]$ are in
bijection with certain Lagrangian Lie subalgebras of the corresponding doubles.
We then attach algebro-geometric data to such Lagrangian subalgebras and, in
this way, obtain a classification of all topological Lie bialgebra structures
with non-trivial doubles. When $F = \mathbb{C}$ the classification becomes
explicit. Furthermore, this result enables us to classify formal solutions of
the classical Yang-Baxter equation.

the distribution of black hole masses. In this paper, we develop first
time-dependent, multi-dimensional, radiation-hydrodynamical models of the
extended optically thick atmospheres and wind outflows of hydrogen-free
classical WR stars. A flux limiting radiation hydrodynamics approach is used on
a finite volume mesh to model WR outflows. The opacities are described using a
combination of tabulated Rosseland mean opacities and the enhanced line
opacities expected within a supersonic flow. For high-luminosity models, a
radiation-driven, dense, supersonic wind is launched from deep sub-surface
regions associated with peaks in the Rosseland mean opacity. For a model with
lower luminosity, on the other hand, the Rosseland mean opacity is not
sufficient to sustain a net-radial outflow in the sub-surface regions. Rather,
what develops in this case is a ""standard"" line-driven wind launched from the
optically thin regions above an extended and highly turbulent atmosphere. We
thus find here a natural transition from optically thick outflows of classical
WR stars to optically thin winds of hot, compact sub-dwarfs; in our simulations
this transition occurs approximately at a luminosity that is about 40% of the
Eddington luminosity. Because of the changing character of the wind-launching
mechanism, this transition is also accompanied by a large drop (on the
low-luminosity end) in average mass-loss rate.

However, data streams are often challenging to handle owing to their rapid pace
and limited information lifetime. It is difficult to collect and communicate
stream samples while storing, transmitting and computing a function across the
whole stream or even a large segment of it. In answer to this research issue,
many streaming-specific solutions were developed. Stream techniques imply a
limited capacity of one or more resources such as computing power and memory,
as well as time or accuracy limits. Reservoir sampling algorithms choose and
store results that are probabilistically significant. A weighted random
sampling approach using a generalised sampling algorithmic framework to detect
unique events is the key research goal of this work. Briefly, a gradually
developed estimate of the joint stream distribution across all feasible
components keeps k stream elements judged representative for the full stream.
Once estimate confidence is high, k samples are chosen evenly. The complexity
is O(min(k,n-k)), where n is the number of items inspected. Due to the fact
that events are usually considered outliers, it is sufficient to extract
element patterns and push them to an alternate version of k-means as proposed
here. The suggested technique calculates the sum of squared errors (SSE) for
each cluster, and this is utilised not only as a measure of convergence, but
also as a quantification and an indirect assessment of the element
distribution's approximation accuracy. This clustering enables for the
detection of outliers in the stream based on their distance from the usual
event centroids. The findings reveal that weighted sampling and res-means
outperform typical approaches for stream event identification. Detected events
are shown as knowledge graphs, along with typical clusters of events.

along the null rays of the associated light signals. One may therefore
decompose the luminosity distance of a given radiation source along these null
geodesics, instead of the timelike worldlines of the emitting/receiving
observers. In so doing, one obtains (among others) the null counterparts of the
familiar Hubble and deceleration parameters. Although the timelike and the null
sets of these parameters coincide in an exact Friedmann universe, they
generally differ in perturbed cosmological models. The situation becomes more
involved in tilted cosmologies, namely in those equipped with two families of
relatively moving observers. There, the two observer groups generally disagree
on the values of these parameters, simply because of their relative motion.
Assuming a tilted, perturbed Friedmann universe with dust, we find that the
relative-motion effects alone can locally change the sign of the null
deceleration parameter from positive to negative, while at the same time the
host universe is globally decelerating. An exactly analogous effect has also
been reported with regard to the timelike deceleration parameter. The
difference is that, in the null case, the impact of the relative motion is
twice as strong, thus making it easier for the unsuspecting observers to
misinterpret a local change in the sign of the deceleration parameter as recent
global acceleration.

largely unknown how to estimate the scene flow from a 4-D radar - an
increasingly popular automotive sensor for its robustness against adverse

data are drastically sparser, noisier and in much lower resolution. Annotated

measured parameters is insufficient to constrain the many variables involved in
describing the interior structure and composition. One solution is to invoke
additional constraints based on arguments about how the planet formed. However,
a planet's actual structure and composition may hold clues to its formation
which would be lost if this structure were not allowed by the initial
assumptions. It is therefore interesting to explore the space of allowable
compositions and structures in order to better understand which cosmogonic
constraints are absolutely necessary. To this end, we describe a code for
generating random, monotonic, density distributions, rho(r), that fit a given
mass, radius, and moment of inertia.
  Integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium gives the pressure, P(r),
at each point in the body. We then provide three algorithms for generating a
monotonic temperature distribution, T(r), and an associated composition that is
consistent with the rho-P relation, and realistic equations of state. We apply
this code to Uranus as a proof of concept, and show that the ratio of rock to

network module for enhancing the performance of 3D object detection in point

critical to tell the difference when the instance geometry is incomplete or
featureless. We find that relations between proposals provide a good
representation to describe the context. However, adopting relations between all
the object or patch proposals for detection is inefficient, and an imbalanced
combination of local and global relations brings extra noise that could mislead
the training. Rather than working with all relations, we found that training
with relations only between the most representative ones, or anchors, can
significantly boost the detection performance. A good anchor should be
semantic-aware with no ambiguity and independent with other anchors as well. To
find the anchors, we first perform a preliminary relation anchor module with an
objectness-aware sampling approach and then devise a displacement-based module
for weighing the relation importance for better utilization of contextual
information. This lightweight relation module leads to significantly higher
accuracy of object instance detection when being plugged into the
state-of-the-art detectors. Evaluations on the public benchmarks of real-world
scenes show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both SUN

safely learn insertion skills with just a few human interventions and without
hand-crafted rewards or demonstrations. Our InsertionNet version 2.0 provides
an improved technique to robustly cope with a wide range of use-cases featuring
different shapes, colors, initial poses, etc. In particular, we present a
regression-based method based on multimodal input from stereo perception and
force, augmented with contrastive learning for the efficient learning of
valuable features. In addition, we introduce a one-shot learning technique for
insertion, which relies on a relation network scheme to better exploit the
collected data and to support multi-step insertion tasks. Our method improves
on the results obtained with the original InsertionNet, achieving an almost
perfect score (above 97.5$\%$ on 200 trials) in 16 real-life insertion tasks
while minimizing the execution time and contact during insertion. We further
demonstrate our method's ability to tackle a real-life 3-step insertion task
and perfectly solve an unseen insertion task without learning.

and X-structures. The sample was prepared using images from the DESI Legacy
catalogue and contains about 2000 galaxies. To find suitable candidates in
catalogue, we made the assumption that the residues (original images minus
model) of galaxies with B/PS bulges should exhibit a characteristic X-shape.
Galaxies with such features were selected by eye and then used as input data
for a neural network training, which was applied to a bigger sample of edge-on
galaxies. Using the available data and the photometric models from the
literature, we investigated the observational and statistical properties of the
sample created. Comparing the $B/D$ ratios for galaxies with and without B/PS
bulges, we found that the $B/D$ ratio for galaxies from our sample is
statistically higher, with typical values in the range $\approx 0.2-0.5$
depending on the decomposition procedure. We studied how the opening angles
$\varphi$ of the X-structure and the length of its rays are distributed in the
formed sample and found them to be consistent with previous measurements and
predictions from $N$-body models, e.g. $\varphi \gtrsim 25~\deg$, but measured
here for a much larger number of galaxies. We found a sharp increase in the
B/PS bulge fraction for stellar masses $\log M_{\star} \gtrsim 10.4$, but for
edge-on galaxies, which complements the results of previous works. The sample
can be used in future work to test various bar models and their relationship
with B/PS bulges, as well as to study their stability and evolution.

machine learning, is largely dominated by efforts to improve the
state-of-the-art, typically in terms of accuracy measures. Several recent
research works however indicate that the reported improvements over the years
sometimes ""don't add up"", and that methods that were published several years
ago often outperform the latest models when evaluated independently. Different
factors contribute to this phenomenon, including that some researchers probably
often only fine-tune their own models but not the baselines. In this paper, we
report the outcomes of an in-depth, systematic, and reproducible comparison of
ten collaborative filtering algorithms - covering both traditional and neural
models - on several common performance measures on three datasets which are
frequently used for evaluation in the recent literature. Our results show that
there is no consistent winner across datasets and metrics for the examined
top-n recommendation task. Moreover, we find that for none of the accuracy
measurements any of the considered neural models led to the best performance.
Regarding the performance ranking of algorithms across the measurements, we
found that linear models, nearest-neighbor methods, and traditional matrix
factorization consistently perform well for the evaluated modest-sized, but
commonly-used datasets. Our work shall therefore serve as a guideline for
researchers regarding existing baselines to consider in future performance
comparisons. Moreover, by providing a set of fine-tuned baseline models for
different datasets, we hope that our work helps to establish a common
understanding of the state-of-the-art for top-n recommendation tasks.

a grid search with several fundamental parameters: the selection and size of

contribute descriptive research around the life of ""AI"" as a discursive concept

startups--and with a focus on extra-organizational pressures faced by

conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at
early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to
and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension
for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological
rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical
knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused
on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing
messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to
preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and
organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices
and their response to actual or impending regulation. We conclude with a
discussion for how such pressures could be used as leverage for effective
interventions towards building ethical AI.

models with their unique features of rich neuronal dynamics, diverse coding
schemes and low power consumption properties. How to obtain a high-accuracy
model has always been the main challenge in the field of SNN. Currently, there
are two mainstream methods, i.e., obtaining a converted SNN through converting
a well-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to its SNN counterpart or
training an SNN directly. However, the inference time of a converted SNN is too
long, while SNN training is generally very costly and inefficient. In this
work, a new SNN training paradigm is proposed by combining the concepts of the
two different training methods with the help of the pretrain technique and
BP-based deep SNN training mechanism. We believe that the proposed paradigm is
a more efficient pipeline for training SNNs. The pipeline includes pipeS for
static data transfer tasks and pipeD for dynamic data transfer tasks. SOTA
results are obtained in a large-scale event-driven dataset ES-ImageNet. For
training acceleration, we achieve the same (or higher) best accuracy as similar
LIF-SNNs using 1/10 training time on ImageNet-1K and 2/5 training time on
ES-ImageNet and also provide a time-accuracy benchmark for a new dataset
ES-UCF101. These experimental results reveal the similarity of the functions of

the lower mass galaxies did so later, producing a change in the MZR which
becomes shallower in time. Separating the sample into morphology and
star-forming status bins some particularly interesting results appear: The mass
dependency of the MZR becomes less relevant for later morphological types, to
the extent that it inverts for Sd/Irr galaxies, suggesting that morphology is
at least as important a factor as mass in chemical evolution. The MZR for the
full sample shows a flattening at the high-mass end and another at the low-mass
range, but the former only appears for retired galaxies while the latter only
appears for star-forming galaxies. We also find that the average metallicity
gradient is currently negative for all mass bins but for low mass galaxies it
was inverted at some point in the past, before which all galaxies had a
positive gradient. We also compare how diverse the ChEHs are in the different
bins considered as well as what primarily drives the diversity: How much
galaxies become enriched or how quickly they do so.

environment perception tasks, their sensitivity to adversarial perturbations
limits their use in practical applications. In this paper, we (i) propose a
novel adversarial perturbation detection scheme based on multi-task perception
of complex vision tasks (i.e., depth estimation and semantic segmentation).
Specifically, adversarial perturbations are detected by inconsistencies between
extracted edges of the input image, the depth output, and the segmentation
output. To further improve this technique, we (ii) develop a novel edge
consistency loss between all three modalities, thereby improving their initial
consistency which in turn supports our detection scheme. We verify our
detection scheme's effectiveness by employing various known attacks and image
noises. In addition, we (iii) develop a multi-task adversarial attack, aiming
at fooling both tasks as well as our detection scheme. Experimental evaluation
on the Cityscapes and KITTI datasets shows that under an assumption of a 5%
false positive rate up to 100% of images are correctly detected as
adversarially perturbed, depending on the strength of the perturbation. Code is

Weyl semimetals (WSMs) in ongoing experiments, quantum oscillation in linear
response regime has been considered as an important signature in the magneto
transports in WSMs, due to its unique relation to CA. Investigating the
nonlinear planar effects (NPEs) starting from the semiclassical regime to the
ultra-quantum limit within the framework of Boltzmann transport theory
incorporating Landau quantization, we here propose the quantum oscillations in
NPEs can serve as a robust signature of CA in WSMs. By obtaining analytical
expressions, we show that the quantum oscillations of the nonlinear effects
exhibit two different period scales in 1/B (B is the magnetic field) compared
to the linear responses where only one period scale exists. We find that these
quantum oscillations in NPEs are attributed to the deviation of chiral chemical
potential (CCP), which is proportional to the finite band tilt as well as
transverse electric field and therefore, directly linked to CA in WSMs. In
addition, we also show that the CA-induced nonlinear magneto conductivity is
linear and independent in the magnetic field in the semiclassical and
ultraquantum regimes, respectively. We conclude that the proposed behaviors of
NPEs in different regimes uniquely signify the existence of CA and therefore,

objects using active airflow. In contrast to conventional contact-based
quasi-static manipulations, DextAIRity allows the system to apply dense forces
on out-of-contact surfaces, expands the system's reach range, and provides safe
high-speed interactions. These properties are particularly advantageous when
manipulating under-actuated deformable objects with large surface areas or
volumes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DextAIRity through two challenging
deformable object manipulation tasks: cloth unfolding and bag opening. We
present a self-supervised learning framework that learns to effectively perform
a target task through a sequence of grasping or air-based blowing actions. By
using a closed-loop formulation for blowing, the system continuously adjusts
its blowing direction based on visual feedback in a way that is robust to the
highly stochastic dynamics. We deploy our algorithm on a real-world three-arm
system and present evidence suggesting that DextAIRity can improve system
efficiency for challenging deformable manipulation tasks, such as cloth
unfolding, and enable new applications that are impractical to solve with
quasi-static contact-based manipulations (e.g., bag opening). Video is

stringent communication constraints. While several recent works address this
challenge for static optimization problems, sequential decision-making under
uncertainty has remained much less explored in this regard. Motivated by this
gap, we introduce a new linear stochastic bandit formulation over a
bit-constrained channel. Specifically, in our setup, an agent interacting with
an environment transmits encoded estimates of an unknown model parameter to a
server over a communication channel of finite capacity. The goal of the server
is to take actions based on these estimates to minimize cumulative regret. To
this end, we develop a novel and general algorithmic framework that hinges on
two main components: (i) an adaptive encoding mechanism that exploits
statistical concentration bounds, and (ii) a decision-making principle based on
confidence sets that account for encoding errors. As our main result, we prove
that when the unknown model is $d$-dimensional, a channel capacity of $O(d)$
bits suffices to achieve order-optimal regret. To demonstrate the generality of
our approach, we then show that the same result continues to hold for
non-linear observation models satisfying standard regularity conditions.
Finally, we establish that for the simpler unstructured multi-armed bandit
problem, $1$ bit channel-capacity is sufficient for achieving optimal regret
bounds. Overall, our work takes a significant first step towards paving the way
for statistical decision-making over finite-capacity channels.

with every argument in a system, which represents the level of acceptability of
this argument, and from which a preference ordering over arguments can be
derived. While some semantics operate over standard argumentation frameworks,
many utilise a weighted framework, where a numeric initial weight is associated
with each argument. Recent work has examined the inverse problem within gradual
semantics. Rather than determining a preference ordering given an argumentation
framework and a semantics, the inverse problem takes an argumentation
framework, a gradual semantics, and a preference ordering as inputs, and
identifies what weights are needed to over arguments in the framework to obtain
the desired preference ordering. Existing work has attacked the inverse problem
numerically, using a root finding algorithm (the bisection method) to identify
appropriate initial weights. In this paper we demonstrate that for a class of
gradual semantics, an analytical approach can be used to solve the inverse

rapidly find a solution, and is guaranteed to do so. In obtaining this result,

issues, we advocate to firstly constrain the consistency of pixels with and
without strong perturbations to apply a sufficient smoothness constraint and
further encourage the class-level separation to exploit the low-entropy
regularization for the model training. Particularly, in this paper, we propose
the SS-Net for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks, via exploring
the pixel-level smoothness and inter-class separation at the same time. The
pixel-level smoothness forces the model to generate invariant results under
adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, the inter-class separation encourages
individual class features should approach their corresponding high-quality

different classes. We evaluated our SS-Net against five recent methods on the

multiple cameras in modern smartphones, the more zoomed (telephoto) image can
be naturally leveraged as the reference to guide the SR of the lesser zoomed

SR result of short-focus image to have the same resolution as the telephoto
image. For this purpose, we take the telephoto image instead of an additional
high-resolution image as the supervision information and select a center patch
from it as the reference to super-resolve the corresponding short-focus image

low-resolution (LR) image and telephoto ground-truth (GT) image, we design an
auxiliary-LR generator and map the GT to an auxiliary-LR while keeping the
spatial position unchanged. Then the auxiliary-LR can be utilized to deform the
LR features by the proposed adaptive spatial transformer networks (AdaSTN), and
match the Ref features to GT. During testing, SelfDZSR can be directly deployed

$>$10mas into GCNS-selected and GCNS-rejected 100pc samples. Below the white
dwarf (WD) sequence in the complete GCNS color-magnitude diagram (CMD), at
$Gabs>14.7+4.7(G-RP)$, there appear 60 GCNS-selected faint blue white dwarfs
(FBWDs). However this CMD region is also populated by 411 GCNS-rejected
objects, mainly from crowded regions towards the Galactic centre and the
Magellanic Clouds. The WD catalog of Gentile Fusillo et al. (2021) lists only
47 GCNS-selected but also 8 GCNS-rejected objects. I confirm 59 of the
GCNS-selected but none of the GCNS-rejected objects as FBWDs from visual
inspection and a proper motion check using additional optical sky surveys.
Hence FBWDs form an additional branch in the CMD. Compared to the full
GCNS-selected 100pc sample, FBWDs have relatively high proper motions and
tangential velocities. They represent interesting targets for studies of
ultracool or infrared-faint, and possibly also ultramassive WDs.

resolution of internal defects/inhomogeneities below the classical limit which
is governed by the diffusion properties of thermal wave propagation. Based on a
combination of the application of special sampling strategies and a subsequent
numerical optimization step in post-processing, thermographic super resolution
has already proven to be superior to standard thermographic methods in the
detection of one-dimensional defect/inhomogeneity structures. In our work, we
report an extension of the capabilities of the method for efficient detection
and resolution of defect cross sections with fully two-dimensional structured
laser-based heating. The reconstruction is carried out using one of two
different algorithms which are proposed within this work. Both algorithms
utilize the combination of several coherent measurements using convex
optimization and exploit the sparse nature of defects/inhomogeneities as is
typical for most nondestructive testing scenarios. Finally, the performance of
each algorithm is rated on reconstruction quality and algorithmic complexity.
The presented experimental approach is based on repeated spatially structured
heating by a high power laser. As a result, a two-dimensional sparse
defect/inhomogeneity map can be obtained. In addition, the obtained results are
compared with those of conventional thermographic inspection methods which make
use of homogeneous illumination. Due to the sparse nature of the reconstructed
defect/inhomogeneity map, this comparison is performed qualitatively.

developed to simulate the realistic performance of the acoustic coatings based
on polyurethane (PU) elastomers with embedded cylindrical voids. The FEM
results revealed that the frequency-dependent viscoelastic behavior of the
polyurethane matrix has a significant impact on the magnitude and frequency of
the absorption peak associated with the cylinders at low frequencies, which has
been commonly ignored in previous studies on similar systems. The data
generated from the FEM was used to train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to
accelerate the design process, and subsequently, was integrated with a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) to determine the optimal geometric parameters of the cylinders
to achieve maximized, broadband, low-frequency waterborne sound attenuation. A
significant, broadband, low-frequency attenuation is achieved by optimally
configuring the layers of cylindrical voids and using attenuation mechanisms,
including Fabry-P\'erot resonance and Bragg scattering of the layers of voids.
Integration of the machine learning technique into the optimization algorithm
further accelerated the exploration of the high dimensional design space for
the targeted performance. The developed DNN exhibited significantly increased
speed (by a factor of $4.5\times 10^3$ ) in predicting the absorption

the size of the observable universe $R_H$, implying that the dark energy varies
depending on this size. The main result of this previous work is the existence
of an effective cosmological constant $\Lambda=2\pi^2/\lambda^2$ that varies
very slowly, being $\lambda=(c/H_0) R_H$ the graviton Compton wavelength. In
the present work we use that the dark energy density parameter is given by
$\Omega_\Lambda=2\pi^2/3/R_H^2$, it only has the curvature $\Omega_k$ as a free
constant and depends exclusively on the radiation density parameter $\Omega_r$.
Using $\Omega_{0r} = 9.54\times10^{- 5}$, the theoretical prediction for a flat
universe of the dark energy density parameter is $\Omega_{0\Lambda} = 0.6922$.
We perform a general study for a non-flat universe, using the Planck data and a
modified version of the CLASS code we find an excellent concordance with the
Cosmic Microwave Background and Mass Power Spectrum profiles, provided that the
Hubble parameter today is $H_0 = 72.6$ km/s/Mpc for an universe with curvature
$\Omega_{0k}=-0.003$. We conclude that the CMaDE model provides a natural
explanation for the accelerated expansion and the coincidence problem of the
universe.

  Algorithms",,,,,"eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper extends the concept of Laplacian filtered quasi-Helmholtz
decompositions we have recently introduced, to the basis-free projector-based
setting. This extension allows the discrete analyses of electromagnetic
integral operators spectra without passing via an explicit Loop-Star
decomposition as previously done. We also present a fast scheme for the
evaluation of the filters in quasi linear complexity in the total number of
unknowns. Together with the fact that only a logarithmic number of these
filters are required for solving the h-refinement breakdown of electric field
integral equation, this results in an effective preconditioner that rivals
Calder\'on strategies in performance without relying on barycentric
refinements. Numerical results confirm the theoretically predicted behavior and
the effectiveness of the approach.

flat bulk geometries that are described by the generalized minimal massive
gravity (GMMG) in the context of the flat holography. To this end, we describe
the boundary by two dimensional Galilean conformal field theory (GCFT) at the
bipartite mixed state of the two disjoint intervals. We make a conjecture on
the minimal entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) and we find that the
results are consistent with the previous computations on the holographic
entanglement negativity.

and manage their customers' personal data. One of the problems that arises with
these privacy policies is that their content might violate data privacy
regulations. Because of the enormous number of privacy policies that exist, the
only realistic way to check for legal inconsistencies in all of them is through
an automated method. In this work, we use Natural Language Inference (NLI)
techniques to compare privacy regulations against sections of privacy policies
from a selection of large companies. Our NLI model uses pre-trained embeddings,
along with BiLSTM in its attention mechanism. We tried two versions of our
model: one that was trained on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI)
and the second on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) dataset. We
found that our test accuracy was higher on our model trained on the SNLI, but
when actually doing NLI tasks on real world privacy policies, the model trained
on MNLI generalized and performed much better.

perform. Even more challenging is to design an optimized portfolio with weights
allocated to the stocks in a way that optimizes its return and the risk. This
paper presents a systematic approach towards building two types of portfolios,
optimum risk, and eigen, for four critical economic sectors of India. The
prices of the stocks are extracted from the web from Jan 1, 2016, to Dec 31,
2020. Sector-wise portfolios are built based on their ten most significant
stocks. An LSTM model is also designed for predicting future stock prices. Six
months after the construction of the portfolios, i.e., on Jul 1, 2021, the
actual returns and the LSTM-predicted returns for the portfolios are computed.
A comparison of the predicted and the actual returns indicate a high accuracy
level of the LSTM model.

challenging problem. In this paper, we address a specific type of information
extraction, namely extracting information related to descriptions of movement.
Aggregating and understanding information related to descriptions of movement
and lack of movement specified in text can lead to an improved understanding
and sensemaking of movement phenomena of various types, e.g., migration of
people and animals, impediments to travel due to COVID-19, etc. We present
GeoMovement, a system that is based on combining machine learning and
rule-based extraction of movement-related information with state-of-the-art
visualization techniques. Along with the depiction of movement, our tool can
extract and present a lack of movement. Very little prior work exists on
automatically extracting descriptions of movement, especially negation and
movement. Apart from addressing these, GeoMovement also provides a novel
integrated framework for combining these extraction modules with visualization.
We include two systematic case studies of GeoMovement that show how humans can
derive meaningful geographic movement information. GeoMovement can complement
precise movement data, e.g., obtained using sensors, or be used by itself when
precise data is unavailable.
