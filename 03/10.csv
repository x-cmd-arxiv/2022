the discovery potential of Higgs factories, such as the Circular Electron

histologies. Some of these therapeutics, and in particular treatment
combinations, are often associated with severe treatment-related adverse events
(AEs). It is therefore important to identify alternative de-intensified
therapies, for example dose-reduced therapies, with reduced AEs and similar
efficacy. We introduce a sequential design for multi-arm de-intensification
studies. The design evaluates multiple de-intensified therapies at different
dose levels, one at the time, based on modeling of toxicity and efficacy
endpoints. We study the utility of the design in oropharynx cancer
de-intensification studies. We use a Bayesian nonparametric model for efficacy
and toxicity outcomes to define decision rules at interim and final analysis.
Interim decisions include early termination of the study due to inferior
survival of experimental arms compared to the standard of care (SOC), and
transitions from one de-intensified treatment arm to another with a further
reduced dose when there is sufficient evidence of non-inferior survival. We
evaluate the operating characteristics of the design using simulations and data
from recent de-intensification studies in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated
oropharynx cancer.

that the values of $\beta$ decrease as we enlarge the Galactic mask, which can
be interpreted as the effect of polarized foreground emission. We use two
independent approaches to model this effect and mitigate its impact on $\beta$.
Although results are promising, and the good agreement between both models is
encouraging, we do not assign cosmological significance to the measured value

has been thoroughly researched in the literature. However, some issues are
still open. This work addresses the identification of the related low-resource

  This work's main goals were: (1) to collect the dataset of three Celtic
languages; (2) to prepare a method to identify the languages from the Celtic
family, i.e. to train a successful classification model; (3) to evaluate the
influence of different feature extraction methods, and explore the
applicability of the unsupervised models as a feature extraction technique; (4)
to experiment with the unsupervised feature extraction on a reduced annotated
set.
  We collected a new dataset including Irish, Scottish, Welsh and English
records. We tested supervised models such as SVM and neural networks with
traditional statistical features alongside the output of clustering,
autoencoder, and topic modelling methods. The analysis showed that the
unsupervised features could serve as a valuable extension to the n-gram feature
vectors. It led to an improvement in performance for more entangled classes.
The best model achieved a 98\% F1 score and 97\% MCC. The dense neural network
consistently outperformed the SVM model.
  The low-resource languages are also challenging due to the scarcity of
available annotated training data. This work evaluated the performance of the
classifiers using the unsupervised feature extraction on the reduced labelled
dataset to handle this issue. The results uncovered that the unsupervised
feature vectors are more robust to the labelled set reduction. Therefore, they
proved to help achieve comparable classification performance with much less

consider that comprehensive cross-modal interactions should be provided. CMX is
built with two streams to extract features from RGB images and the X-modality.
In each feature extraction stage, we design a Cross-Modal Feature Rectification
Module (CM-FRM) to calibrate the feature of the current modality by combining
the feature from the other modality, in spatial- and channel-wise dimensions.
With rectified feature pairs, we deploy a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to mix
them for the final semantic prediction. FFM is constructed with a
cross-attention mechanism, which enables exchange of long-range contexts,
enhancing bi-modal features globally. Extensive experiments show that CMX
generalizes to diverse multi-modal combinations, achieving state-of-the-art
performances on five RGB-Depth benchmarks, as well as RGB-Thermal,

fair distributed energy resource (DER) coordination in the context of mandated
rooftop PV inverter control modes. In practice, inverter reactive power control
is increasingly required by grid connection codes, which often unfairly curtail
PV generation of prosumers towards the end of low-voltage feeders. Similarly,
optimization-based DER coordination methods that aim solely for
technically-efficient DER coordination do not consider the distribution of PV
curtailment across customers. To address these concerns, we develop a tractable
multi-objective DOPF method for optimal DER coordination that (i) curtails PV
generation fairly across prosumers, and (ii) incorporates a standard
piecewise-linear volt-var control reactive power control function without using
integer variables. Three equity principles representing different
interpretations of fairness are implemented in our coordination method; namely,
egalitarian, proportional and uniform dynamic PV curtailment redistribution.
The performance of our approach is demonstrated on low-voltage distribution
feeders of different sizes (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 prosumers) using two network
topologies: line topology without lateral spurs and tree topology with lateral
spurs. Each network considers three levels of PV penetration, giving 30 test
systems in total. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
DOPF method for fair DER coordination: PV curtailment is equitably distributed
among prosumers with a computational burden on par with conventional DOPF
approaches. Moreover, different fairness methods result in different patterns
of curtailment, which a regulator may choose between.

configuration interaction (CI) and other related methods, the state is
represented as a superposition of a large number of Slater determinants, which
in case of CI calculations reaches about 20 billion terms. Although in practice
this number has been used as a CM for decades, it is ill defined: it is not
unique, and it depends on the particular type and the number of single-particle

  The canonical wave functions/natural orbitals and their corresponding
occupation probabilities are intrinsic properties of any many-body wave
function, irrespective of the representation, and they provide a unique
solution to characterize the CM. The non-negative orbital entanglement entropy,

Previous Transformer-based methods densely sample tokens, some of which are

bijel. In these systems the nature and dynamics of jamming remains unknown.
Here we propose and study a scenario we call metric jamming that aims to
capture the complex interactions between shape and particles. Unlike classical
jamming processes that exhibit discrete mechanical transitions, surprisingly we
find that metric jammed states possess mechanical properties that are
continuously tunable between those of classical jammed and conventional elastic
media. New types of vibrational mode that couple particulate and surface

  System as a Demonstrator for CMOS Fast Timing Sensors",,,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The Belle II barrel region is instrumented with the Time of Propagation (TOP)
particle identification system based on sixteen fused-silica bars arranged
around the interaction point acting as Cherenkov radiator. Due to the
mechanical design of the TOP system these quartz bars do not overlap, but leave
a gap of around 2cm between them. This leads to around 6% of all tracks in the
nominal TOP acceptance region to escape without traversing any of the quartz
bars and thus not giving any usable particle identification information from
the TOP system and an additional 3% of tracks being degraded due to edge
effects. We propose a possible solution to remedy these gaps in the TOP
acceptance in the form of a Supplemental TOP GAP instrumentation (STOPGAP) that
covers the dead area between adjacent quartz bars with fast silicon detectors
to directly measure the time-of-flight of traversing particles for particle
identification purposes. Modern, fast timing silicon sensors and readouts can
offer sufficient time resolution for the task at hand, so that STOPGAP modules
could be built compact enough to fit into the limited space available in the
area of interest between the Belle II central drift chamber (CDC) and the TOP
system.
  In this article, we present a simulation study demonstrating the feasibility
of a silicon time-of-flight system based on its reconstruction performance in
$\Upsilon(4S)\rightarrow B\bar{B}$ events simulated using the Belle II
simulation and reconstruction software. We discuss the performance requirements
for possible sensor technologies and demonstrate that such a project could be
realised with novel, fast monolithic CMOS sensors that are expected to reach
MIP timing resolutions of down to 50ps. Additionally, we discuss the use of
fast timing layers at lower radii for track triggering as well as particle
identification at low momenta <1GeV/c.

of machine learning due to the fact that small perturbations in the data can
result in major performance degradation. This phenomenon is usually modeled by
a malicious adversary that can apply perturbations to the data in a constrained
fashion, such as being bounded in a certain norm. In this paper, we study this
problem when the adversary is constrained by the $\ell_0$ norm; i.e., it can
perturb a certain number of coordinates in the input, but has no limit on how
much it can perturb those coordinates. Due to the combinatorial nature of this
setting, we need to go beyond the standard techniques in robust machine
learning to address this problem. We consider a binary classification scenario
where $d$ noisy data samples of the true label are provided to us after
adversarial perturbations. We introduce a classification method which employs a
nonlinear component called truncation, and show in an asymptotic scenario, as
long as the adversary is restricted to perturb no more than $\sqrt{d}$ data
samples, we can almost achieve the optimal classification error in the absence
of the adversary, i.e. we can completely neutralize adversary's effect.
Surprisingly, we observe a phase transition in the sense that using a converse
argument, we show that if the adversary can perturb more than $\sqrt{d}$
coordinates, no classifier can do better than a random guess.

relies only on the proximity of the energy of the state to the two-hadron

high-Tc superconductivity lies in understanding the anomalous normal state from
which pairs form and condense. While many of its defining properties have been
identified, they are often considered either at a singular doping level or as
an isolated phenomenon as a function of doping. As a result, their relation to
each other and to the pseudogap (PG), strange metal (SM) and
non-superconducting (non-SC) regimes that define the cuprate phase diagram has
yet to be elucidated. Here, we report a high-field in-plane MR study on several
cuprate families spanning all 3 regimes that reveal a complex yet nonetheless
systematic evolution of the form of the MR, with each regime possessing its own
distinct scaling behavior. In the PG regime, the MR exhibits pure H/T^2 scaling
at low fields and H-linearity at the highest field strengths. While the
H-linearity persists inside the SM regime, the scaling changes abruptly to H/T.
The size of the H-linear slope, meanwhile, is found to be correlated with both
the T-linear resistivity coefficient and Tc, strengthening the characterization
of the SM regime as a quantum critical phase. We interpret the omnipresence of
H-linear MR across both regimes as a signature of highly anisotropic, possibly
discontinuous features on the Fermi surface. Finally, within the non-SC,
Fermi-liquid regime, we observe a recovery of conventional Kohler scaling. This
comprehensive study establishes the distinct nature of the magnetotransport
within each regime and identifies power-law scaling of the normal state MR as a
defining feature of SC hole-doped cuprates. The incompatibility of such
power-law scaling with any known variant of Boltzmann transport theory
motivates the quest for an altogether new theoretical framework, one in which
the MR is entirely decoupled from elastic impurity scattering.

particle diffusing in a domain containing a single target $\calU $. The target
boundary $\partial \calU$ is taken to be a reactive surface that modifies an
internal state $Z_t$ of the particle when in contact with the surface at time
$t$, with $Z_0=h$. The state $Z_t$ is taken to be a monotonically decreasing
function of the so-called boundary local time, and absorption occurs as soon as
$Z_t$ reaches zero. (The boundary local time is a Brownian functional that
determines the amount of time that the particle spends in a neighborhood of
$\partial \calU$.) We first show how to analyze threshold surface absorption in
terms of the joint probability density or generalized propagator
$P_0(\x,\ell,t|\x_0)$ for the pair $(\X_t,\ell_t)$ in the case of a perfectly
reflecting surface, where $\X_t$ and $\ell_t$ denote the particle position and
local time at time $t$, respectively, and $\x_0$ is the initial position. We
then introduce a generalized stochastic resetting protocol in which both the
position $\X_t$ and the internal state $Z_t$ are reset to their initial values,
$\X_t\rightarrow \x_0$ and $Z_t\rightarrow h$, at a Poisson rate $r$. The
latter is mathematically equivalent to resetting the boundary local time,
$\ell_t\rightarrow 0$. Since resetting is governed by a renewal process, the
survival probability with resetting can be expressed in terms of the survival
probability without resetting, which means that the statistics of absorption
can be determined by calculating the Laplace transform of $P_0(\x,\ell,t|\x_0)$
with respect to $t$. We contrast this with the case where only particle
position is reset, which is not governed by a renewal process. We illustrate

solution of a co-coercive equation. We show that one method is equivalent to
another via a simple transformation, leading to a simple convergence proof for
Nesterov's accelerated scheme. Alternatively, we directly establish convergence
rates of Nesterov's accelerated variant, and as a consequence, we obtain a new
convergence rate of the Halpern fixed-point iteration. Next, we apply our
results to different methods such as proximal-point, forwarb-backward
splitting, and three-operator splitting methods for solving monotone
inclusions, where our convergence guarantees are applicable. Since the forward
scheme requires the co-coerciveness of the underlying operator, we derive new
Nesterov's accelerated variants for both recent extra-anchored gradient and
past-extra anchored gradient methods which can avoid the co-coerciveness
assumption. For the extra-anchored gradient method, we consider two variants
studied in [43] for the monotone case and in [21] for the co-monotone case. The
latter covers the former as a special case and has a tighter convergence rate.
For the past-extra anchored gradient method (an accelerated variant of the
optimistic gradient method) [41], we obtain a new Nesterov's accelerated
variant with two past-iterate correction terms that may help to develop new
Nesterov's accelerated methods for minimax problems and their continuous views.
We test our theoretical results on two numerical examples, where the actual
convergence rates match well the theoretical rates up to a constant factor.

factor has far-reaching applications in analytic approximations, gravitational

non-spinning, quasi-circular binaries with mass ratios ranging from $m_A/m_B =
1$ to $m_A/m_B = 9.5$ we are able to recover the leading small-mass-ratio (SMR)
prediction with relative differences of order $10^{-5}$ from simulations alone.
The next-to-leading order term that we extract agrees with the SMR prediction
arising from self-force calculations, with differences of a few percent. These
deviations from the first-order conservative prediction are consistent with
non-adiabatic effects that can be accommodated in an SMR expansion. This fact
is also supported by a comparison to the conservative post-Newtonian prediction
of the redshifts. For the individual redshifts, a re-expansion in terms of the
symmetric mass ratio $\nu$ does not improve the convergence of the series.
However we find that when looking at the sum of the redshift factors of both
back holes, $z_A + z_B$, which is symmetric under the exchange of the masses, a
re-expansion in $\nu$ accelerates its convergence. Our work provides further
evidence of the surprising effectiveness of SMR approximations in modeling even

supplemental information for extracting salient objects in complex

widely applied. While general depth sensors produce the noisy and sparse depth
information, which brings the depth-based networks with irreversible
interference. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task and multi-modal
filtered transformer (MMFT) network for RGB-D salient object detection (SOD).
Specifically, we unify three complementary tasks: depth estimation, salient
object detection and contour estimation. The multi-task mechanism promotes the
model to learn the task-aware features from the auxiliary tasks. In this way,
the depth information can be completed and purified. Moreover, we introduce a
multi-modal filtered transformer (MFT) module, which equips with three
modality-specific filters to generate the transformer-enhanced feature for each
modality. The proposed model works in a depth-free style during the testing
phase. Experiments show that it not only significantly surpasses the
depth-based RGB-D SOD methods on multiple datasets, but also precisely predicts
a high-quality depth map and salient contour at the same time. And, the
resulted depth map can help existing RGB-D SOD methods obtain significant
performance gain. The source code will be publicly available at

We apply the method for calibrating an array of optically pumped magnetometers

of the coils at multiple known positions using a well-calibrated triaxial
magnetometer and model these discreetly sampled fields using vector-spherical
harmonics (VSH) functions. We then localize and calibrate a sensor by
minimizing the sum of squared errors between the model signals and the sensor
responses to the coil fields. We show that by using homogeneous and first-order
gradient fields, the sensor parameters (gain, position, and orientation) can be
obtained from a set of linear equations with pseudo-inverses of two matrices.
By determining the coil currents based on the VSH models, the coil fields can
approximate these low-order field components, yielding computationally simple
initial estimates of the sensor parameters. As a first test of the method, we
placed a fluxgate magnetometer at multiple positions and estimated the RMS
position, orientation, and gain errors of the method to be 1.0 mm, 0.2{\deg}

accuracy of the OPM calibration was tested by using the OPM array to localize
magnetic dipoles in a phantom, which resulted in an average position error of
3.3 mm. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using electromagnetic coils

model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) presents as a natural alternative for
few-shot transfer learning, the expensive computation due to implicit

propose a simple algorithm, Model-Agnostic Multitask Fine-tuning (MAMF), which

Despite its simplicity, we show that MAMF consistently outperforms classical
fine-tuning on five few-shot vision-language classification tasks. We further
show that the effectiveness of the bi-level optimization in MAML is highly
sensitive to the zero-shot performance of a task in the context of few-shot

regression due to its ability to quickly adapt to unseen tasks. However, it has

this barely explored area. \emph{First}, we design two new types of
cross-category level vision regression tasks, namely object discovery and pose
estimation of unprecedented complexity in the meta-learning domain for computer
vision. To this end, we (i) exhaustively evaluate common meta-learning
techniques on these tasks, and (ii) quantitatively analyze the effect of
various deep learning techniques commonly used in recent meta-learning
algorithms in order to strengthen the generalization capability: data
augmentation, domain randomization, task augmentation and meta-regularization.
Finally, we (iii) provide some insights and practical recommendations for
training meta-learning algorithms on vision regression tasks. \emph{Second}, we
propose the addition of functional contrastive learning (FCL) over the task

end-to-end fashion. The experimental results show that the results of prior
work are misleading as a consequence of a poor choice of the loss function as
well as too small meta-training sets. Specifically, we find that CNPs
outperform MAML on most tasks without fine-tuning. Furthermore, we observe that
naive task augmentation without a tailored design results in underfitting.

have a spatially varying point spread function (PSF). Specific scientific goals
require a high-fidelity estimation of the PSF at target positions where no
direct measurement of the PSF is provided. Even though observations of the PSF
are available at some positions of the field of view (FOV), they are
undersampled, noisy, and integrated into wavelength in the instrument's
passband. PSF modeling represents a challenging ill-posed problem, as it
requires building a model from degraded observations that can infer a
super-resolved PSF at any wavelength and position in the FOV. Our model, coined
WaveDiff, proposes a paradigm shift in the data-driven modeling of the point
spread function field of telescopes. We change the data-driven modeling space
from the pixels to the wavefront by adding a differentiable optical forward
model into the modeling framework. This change allows the transfer of
complexity from the instrumental response into the forward model. The proposed
model relies on stochastic gradient descent to estimate its parameters. Our
framework paves the way to building powerful, physically motivated models that
do not require special calibration data. This paper demonstrates the WaveDiff
model in a simplified setting of a space telescope. The proposed framework
represents a performance breakthrough with respect to the existing
state-of-the-art data-driven approach. The pixel reconstruction errors decrease
6-fold at observation resolution and 44-fold for a 3x super-resolution. The
ellipticity errors are reduced at least 20 times, and the size error is reduced
more than 250 times. By only using noisy broad-band in-focus observations, we

applications such as graph and data analytics, recommender systems, or graph

given a question, which is crucial for personal assistants when replying to the
queries from the users. Existing SQA methods all rely on Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) transcripts. Not only does ASR need to be trained with
massive annotated data that are time and cost-prohibitive to collect for
low-resourced languages, but more importantly, very often the answers to the
questions include name entities or out-of-vocabulary words that cannot be
recognized correctly. Also, ASR aims to minimize recognition errors equally
over all words, including many function words irrelevant to the SQA task.
Therefore, SQA without ASR transcripts (textless) is always highly desired,
although known to be very difficult.
  This work proposes Discrete Spoken Unit Adaptive Learning (DUAL), leveraging
unlabeled data for pre-training and fine-tuned by the SQA downstream task. The
time intervals of spoken answers can be directly predicted from spoken

increased degradation on the best performing groups).
  Extending the bias-variance decomposition for classification to fairness, we
theoretically explain why the majority of fairness classifiers designed for low

a scenario common to computer vision. We corroborate this analysis with
extensive experimental support that shows that many of the fairness heuristics

Experiments can independently probe the overall charge response of the

electrochemical interface has so far been challenging due to the low accuracy
of classical molecular dynamics (MD) for capacitance and the limited time and
length scales of \emph{ab initio} MD (AIMD). Here, we combine large ensembles
of long-time-scale classical MD simulations with charge response from
electronic density functional theory (DFT) to predict the potential-dependent
capacitance of a family of ideal aqueous electrochemical interfaces with
different peak capacitances. We show that, while the potential of maximum
capacitance varies, this entire family exhibits an electrode charge of maximum
capacitance (CMC) between -3.7 $\mu$C/cm$^2$ and -3.3 $\mu$C/cm$^2$, regardless
of details in the electronic response. Simulated heating of the same interfaces
reveals that the entropy peaks at a charge of maximum entropy (CME) of $-6.4

electrodes. The CME and CMC both indicate asymmetric response of interfacial
water that is stronger for negatively charged electrodes, while the difference

MEMS and piezoelectric Deformable Mirrors (DMs), exhibit nonlinear behavior.
The nonlinear behavior manifests itself in nonlinear actuator couplings,
nonlinear actuator deformation characteristics, and in the case of
piezoelectric DMs, hysteresis. Furthermore, in a number of situations, DM
behavior can change over time, and this requires a procedure for updating the
DM models on the basis of the observed data. If not properly modeled and if not
taken into account when designing control algorithms, nonlinearities, and
time-varying DM behavior, can significantly degrade the achievable closed-loop
performance of Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. Widely used approaches for DM
control are based on pre-estimated linear time-invariant DM models in the form
of influence matrices. Often, these models are not being updated during system
operation. Consequently, when the nonlinear DM behavior is excited by control
signals with wide operating ranges, or when the DM behavior changes over time,
the state-of-the-art DM control approaches relying upon linear control methods,
might not be able to produce a satisfactory closed-loop performance of an AO
system. Motivated by these key facts, we present a novel method for data-driven
DM control. Our approach combines a simple open-loop control method with a
recursive least squares method for dynamically updating the DM model. The DM
model is constantly being updated on the basis of the dynamically changing DM
operating points. That is, the proposed method updates both the control actions
and the DM model during the system operation. We experimentally verify this
approach on a Boston Micromachines MEMS DM with 140 actuators. Preliminary
experimental results reported in this manuscript demonstrate good potential for
using the developed method for DM control.

mRS if everyone in the dataset had experienced a certain EA burden and were

that the existence time of the solution can be prolonged, with ""well-prepared""

starbursting galaxy M82. Emission from the cloud is seen in H$\alpha$ and
[NII]$\lambda$6583 in data obtained though a small pathfinder instrument used
to test the key ideas that will be implemented in the Dragonfly Spectral Line
Mapper, an upcoming ultranarrow-bandpass imaging version of the Dragonfly
Telephoto Array. The discovered cloud has a shell-like morphology with a linear
extent of $0.8^{\circ}$ and is positioned $0.6^{\circ}$ northwest of M82. At
the heliocentric distance of the M81 group, the cloud's extent corresponds to
55 kpc and its projected distance from the nucleus of M82 is 40 kpc. The cloud
has an average H$\alpha$ surface brightness of $2\times10^{-18}$ $\mathrm{erg}
~\mathrm{cm}^{-2} ~\mathrm{s}^{-1} ~\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}$. The
[NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ line ratio varies from [NII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim0.2$
to [NII]/H$\alpha$ $\sim1.0$ across the cloud, with higher values found in its
eastern end. Follow-up spectra obtained with Keck-LRIS confirm the existence of
the cloud and yield line ratios of [NII]$\lambda$6583/H$\alpha$ = 0.340 $\pm$
0.003 and [SII]$\lambda$6716,6731/H$\alpha$ = 0.64 $\pm$ 0.03 in the cloud.
This giant cloud of material could be lifted from M82 by tidal interactions or
by its powerful starburst. Alternatively, it may be gas infalling from the
cosmic web, potentially precipitated by the superwinds of M82. Deeper data are
needed to test these ideas further. The upcoming Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper
will have 120 lenses, $40\times$ more than in the pathfinder instrument used to
obtain the data presented here.

compared to more isolated systems. Understanding how this difference originates
and whether it is already in place at high redshift is still a matter of
debate. Thanks to uniquely deep optical spectra from the VANDELS survey, we
investigate environmental effects on the stellar mass-metallicity relation
(MZR) for a sample of ~1000 star-forming galaxies at 2<z<4. We complement our
dataset with MOSFIRE follow-up of 21 galaxies to study the environmental
dependence of the gas-phase MZR. Robust stellar and gas metallicities are
derived, respectively, from well-calibrated photospheric absorptions features
at 1501 and 1719 \AA in the stacked spectra, and from optical emission lines
([OII]3726-3729, [OIII]5007, and Hbeta) in individual systems. We characterize
the environment through multiple criteria by using the local galaxy density
maps previously derived in VANDELS. We find that environmental effects are weak
at these redshifts, and more important around the densest overdensity
structures, where galaxies have a lower stellar Z (by 0.2 dex) and a lower
gas-phase Z (by 0.1 dex) compared to the field, with a significance of 1 and 2
sigma, respectively. Crucially, this offset cannot be explained by a selection
effect due to a higher SFR, a fainter UV continuum, or different dust
attenuations and stellar ages. Despite the still low S/N of our results, we
propose a combination of increased mergers and high-speed encounters, more
efficient AGN feedback in dense cores, and cold gas inflows as viable
mechanisms diluting the metal content of overdense galaxies or expelling their
metals to the IGM. Finally, some tensions remain with semi-analytic models and
hydrodynamical simulations, which predict no significant offset as a function
of host halo mass, suggesting that an explicit implementation of environmental
processes is needed.

frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) systems is challenging because of the large overhead in training and
feedback. In this paper, we propose a deep generative model (DGM)-based
technique to address this challenge. Exploiting the partial reciprocity of
uplink and downlink channels, we first estimate the frequency-independent
underlying channel parameters, i.e., the magnitudes of path gains, delays,
angles-of-arrivals (AoAs) and angles-of-departures (AoDs), via uplink training,
since these parameters are common in both uplink and downlink. Then, the
frequency-specific underlying channel parameters, namely, the phase of each
propagation path, are estimated via downlink training using a very short
training signal. In the first step, we incorporate the underlying distribution
of the channel parameters as a prior into our channel estimation algorithm. We
use DGMs to learn this distribution. Simulation results indicate that our
proposed DGM-based channel estimation technique outperforms, by a large gap,
the conventional channel estimation techniques in practical ranges of
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, a near-optimal performance is
achieved using only few downlink pilot measurements.

in one dimension, such as a Bose gas with a two-body contact interaction.
However, when a one-dimensional system is realized by confining bosons into a
tight matter waveguide, an effective three-body interaction inevitably arises
as leading perturbation to break the integrability. This fact motivates us to
study the thermal conductivity of a Bose gas in one dimension with both
two-body and three-body interactions. In particular, we evaluate the Kubo
formula exactly to the lowest order in perturbation by summing up all
contributions that are naively higher orders in perturbation but become
comparable in the zero-frequency limit due to the pinch singularity.
Consequently, a self-consistent equation for a vertex function is derived,
showing that the thermal conductivity in quasi-one-dimension is dominated by
the three-body interaction rather than the two-body interaction. Furthermore,
the resulting thermal conductivity in the weak-coupling limit proves to be
identical to that computed based on the quantum Boltzmann equation and its

powder x-ray diffraction clearly rules out any change in the lattice symmetry
below the MIT, nevertheless a clear anomaly in the Ir-O-Ir bond angle and Ir-O
bond length is evident at the onset of MIT. From the x-ray absorption near edge
structure (XANES) spectroscopic study of Ir-L3 and L2 edges, the effective
spin-orbit coupling is found to be intermediate, at least quite far from the
strong atomic spin-orbit coupling limit. Powder neutron diffraction measurement
is in line with an all-in-all-out magnetic structure of the Ir-tetrahedra in
this compound, which is quite common among rare-earth pyrochlore iridates. The
sharp change in the Ir-O-Ir bond angle around the MIT possibly arises from the
exchange striction mechanism, which favors an enhanced electron correlation via
weakening of Ir-Ir orbital overlap and an insulating phase below TMI . The
theoretical calculations indicate an insulating state for shorter bond angle
validating the experimental observation. Our DFT calculations show a
possibility of intriguing topological phase below a critical value of the Ir-O
distance, which is shorter than the experimentally observed bond length.
Therefore, a topological state may be realized in bulk Eu2Ir2O7 sample if the
Ir-O bond length can be reduced by the application of sufficient external
pressure.

We show that this selection problem is a weakly submodular maximization
problem, thus it can be provably approximated using an efficient greedy
algorithm. Our method is guaranteed to have an exponentially decreasing error

linearized nonlocal solution by perturbing around the well-known local 'kink',

formalism to study the solution around the origin, and use it to verify the

derive a theoretical constraint on the energy scale of nonlocality which must
be larger than the corresponding symmetry-breaking scale. We also briefly

the three relaxation processes show large jumps in the dielectric strength and

least frequency process is proven to be due to the conductivity of ions in the

like in the N phase. The intermediate frequency mode is proven to be due to the
correlation of molecules of the medium as is normally observed in liquid

the bias by locally modifying stabilizers or changing boundary conditions has
been shown to greatly increase error correction thresholds. In this work, we
explore the challenges of using a specific tailored code, the XY surface code,
for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce efficient and
fault-tolerant decoders, belief-matching and belief-find, which exploit
correlated hyperedge fault mechanisms present in circuit-level noise. Using
belief-matching, we find that the XY surface code has a higher threshold and
lower overhead than the square CSS surface code for moderately biased noise.
However, the rectangular CSS surface code has a lower qubit overhead than the
XY surface code when below threshold. We identify a contributor to the reduced
performance that we call fragile boundary errors. These are string-like errors
that can occur along spatial or temporal boundaries in planar architectures or
during logical state preparation and measurement. While we make partial
progress towards mitigating these errors by deforming the boundaries of the XY
surface code, our work suggests that fragility could remain a significant
obstacle, even for other tailored codes. We expect that our decoders will have
other uses; belief-find has an almost-linear running time, and we show that it
increases the threshold of the surface code to 0.937(2)% in the presence of
circuit-level depolarising noise, compared to 0.817(5)% for the more
computationally expensive minimum-weight perfect matching decoder.

quiescent galaxies from our analysis. These allow us to compare the SFR of the
two populations in a uniform manner, minimizing systematics and selection
effects. Our results show that at low to moderate X-ray luminosities, AGN tend
to have lower or, at most, equal star formation rates compared to non-AGN

additional preferences. Existing methods either require repeated episodes of
interactions or assume prior known reward features, which is data-inefficient
and can hardly transfer to new tasks. We relax these assumptions by describing
human tasks in terms of object-centric sub-tasks and interpreting physical
interventions in relation to specific objects. Our method, Object Preference
Adaptation (OPA), is composed of two key stages: 1) pre-training a base policy
to produce a wide variety of behaviors, and 2) online-updating according to
human feedback. The key to our fast, yet simple adaptation is that general
interaction dynamics between agents and objects are fixed, and only
object-specific preferences are updated. Our adaptation occurs online, requires
only one human intervention (one-shot), and produces new behaviors never seen
during training. Trained on cheap synthetic data instead of expensive human
demonstrations, our policy correctly adapts to human perturbations on realistic
tasks on a physical 7DOF robot. Videos, code, and supplementary material are

cavity modes and a quantum molecular subsystem described by the
nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, where electrons and specified nuclei
are treated quantum mechanically on the same level. This semiclassical
real-time NEO approach provides a unified description of electronic and
vibrational strong couplings and describes the impact of the cavity on coupled
nuclear-electronic dynamics while including nuclear quantum effects. For a
single o-hydroxybenzaldehyde molecule under electronic strong coupling, this
approach shows that the cavity suppression of excited state intramolecular
proton transfer is influenced not only by the polaritonic potential energy
surface but also by the timescale of the chemical reaction. This work provides
the foundation for exploring collective strong coupling in nuclear-electronic
quantum dynamical systems within optical cavities.

for sufficiently small input sizes can be performed on a quantum device or a
simulation thereof. For larger input sizes, alternative approaches are
required.
  In this paper we consider an approach that combines classical emulation with
rigorous complexity bounds: simulating quantum algorithms by running classical
versions of the sub-routines, whilst simultaneously collecting information
about what the run-time of the quantum routine would have been if it were run
instead. To do this accurately and efficiently for very large input sizes, we
describe an estimation procedure that provides provable guarantees on the
estimates that it obtains. A nice feature of this approach is that it allows
one to compare the performance of quantum and classical algorithms on
particular inputs of interest, rather than only on those that allow for an
easier mathematical analysis.
  We apply our method to some simple quantum speedups of classical heuristic
algorithms for solving the well-studied MAX-k-SAT optimization problem. To do
this we first obtain some rigorous bounds (including all constants) on the
expected- and worst-case complexities of two important quantum sub-routines,
which improve upon existing results and might be of broader interest: Grover
search with an unknown number of marked items, and quantum maximum-finding. Our
results suggest that such an approach can provide insightful and meaningful
information, in particular when the speedup is of a small polynomial nature.

in galaxy clusters find that the scaling relations are steeper than that of the
hot plasma, signaling kinetic energy losses and the presence of supersonic
flows. In this work we use high-resolution simulations to explore the turbulent
velocity structure of the cold filaments at the cores of galaxy clusters. Our
results indicate that supersonic turbulent structures can be ""frozen"" in the
cold gas that cools and fragments out of a fast, $10^7$ K outflow driven by the
central active galactic nucleus (AGN), when the radiative cooling time is
shorter than the dynamical sound-crossing time. After the cold gas formation,
however, the slope of the velocity structure function (VSF) flattens
significantly over short, 10 Myr timescales. The lack of flattened VSF in
observations of H$\alpha$ filaments indicates that the H$\alpha$-emitting phase
is short-lived for the cold gas in galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the
ubiquity of supersonic turbulence revealed by observed filaments strongly
suggests that supersonic outflows are an integral part of AGN-ICM interaction,
and that AGN activity plays a crucial role at driving turbulence in galaxy
clusters.

spectroscopy) is comprised of a sample of 8 massive ($\log M_*/M_\odot > 10.6$)
strongly lensed quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$. REQUIEM-2D combines the natural
magnification from strong gravitational lensing with the high
spatial-resolution grism spectroscopy of \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} through
a spectrophotometric fit to study spatially resolved stellar populations. We
show that quiescent galaxies in the REQUIEM-2D survey have diverse formation
histories manifesting as a gradient in stellar ages, including examples of (1)
a younger central region supporting outside-in formation, (2) flat age
gradients that show evidence for both spatially-uniform early formation or
inside-out quenching, and (3) regions at a fixed radial distance having
different ages (such asymmetries cannot be recovered when averaging stellar
population measurements azimuthally). The typical dust attenuation curve for
the REQUIEM-2D galaxies is constrained to be steeper than Calzetti's law in the
UV and generally consistent with $A_V<1$. Combined together and accounting for
the different physical radial distances and formation time-scales, we find that
the REQUIEM-2D galaxies that formed earlier in the universe exhibit slow and
uniform growth in their inner core, whereas the galaxies that formed later have
rapid inner growth in their inner core with younger ages relative to the
outskirts. These results challenge the currently accepted paradigm of how
massive quiescent galaxies form, where the earliest galaxies are thought to
form most rapidly. Significantly larger samples close to the epoch of formation
with similar data quality and higher spectral resolution are required to

hot with an approximately isotropic velocity ellipsoid and a modest net
rotation. Aurora stars exhibit large scatter in metallicity and in a number of
element abundance ratios. The median tangential velocity of the in-situ stars
increases sharply with increasing metallicity between [Fe/H]$=-1.3$ and $-0.9$,
the transition that we call the spin-up. The observed and theoretically
expected age-metallicity correlations imply that this increase reflects a rapid
formation of the Milky Way disk over $\approx 1-2$ Gyrs. The transformation of
the stellar kinematics as a function of [Fe/H] is accompanied by a qualitative
change in chemical abundances: the scatter drops sharply once the Galaxy builds
up a disk during later epochs corresponding to [Fe/H]$>-0.9$. Results of galaxy
formation models presented in this and other recent studies strongly indicate
that the trends observed in the Milky Way reflect generic processes during the
early evolution of progenitors of MW-sized galaxies: a period of chaotic
pre-disk evolution, when gas is accreted along cold narrow filaments and when
stars are born in irregular configurations, and subsequent rapid disk
formation. The latter signals formation of a stable hot gaseous halo around the
MW progenitor, which changes the mode of gas accretion and allows development
of coherently rotating disk.

constraining the nature of the dark matter (DM). This will be even more true
with the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We run cosmological
simulations of galaxy formation as part of the Effective Theory of Structure
Formation (ETHOS) project to compare high redshift galaxies in Cold (CDM) and
alternative DM models which have varying relativistic coupling and
self-interaction strengths. The interacting DM scenarios produce a cutoff in
the linear power spectrum on small-scales, followed by a series of ""dark
acoustic oscillations"". We find that DM interactions suppress the abundance of
galaxies below $M_\star \sim 10^8\,M_\odot$ for the models considered. The
cutoff in the power spectrum delays structure formation relative to CDM.
Objects in ETHOS that end up at the same final masses as their CDM counterparts
are characterised by a more vigorous phase of early star formation. While
galaxies with $M_\star \lesssim 10^6\,M_\odot$ make up more than 60 per cent of
star formation in CDM at $z\approx 10$, they contribute only about half the
star formation density in ETHOS. These differences diminish with decreasing
redshift. We find that the effects of DM self-interactions are negligible
compared to effects of relativistic coupling (i.e. the effective initial
conditions for galaxy formation) in all properties of the galaxy population we
examine. Finally, we show that the clustering strength of galaxies at high
redshifts depends sensitively on DM physics, although these differences are
manifest on scales that may be too small to be measurable by JWST.

galaxies remains debated, and various types of objects have been considered,
including Wolf-Rayet stars, X-ray binaries, and Population III stars. Modern
X-ray observations show the ubiquitous presence of hot gas filling star-forming
galaxies. We use a collisional ionization plasma code to compute the specific
HeII ionizing flux produced by hot gas and show that if its temperature is not
too high (less than 2.5 MK), then the observed levels of soft diffuse X-ray
radiation could explain HeII ionization in galaxies. To gain a physical
understanding of this result, we propose a model that combines the
hydrodynamics of cluster winds and hot superbubbles with observed populations
of young massive clusters in galaxies. We find that in low-metallicity
galaxies, the temperature of hot gas is lower and the production rate of HeII
ionizing photons is higher compared to high-metallicity galaxies. The reason is
that the slower stellar winds of massive stars in lower-metallicity galaxies
input less mechanical energy in the ambient medium. Furthermore, we show that
ensembles of star clusters up to 10-20 Myr old in galaxies can produce enough
soft X-rays to induce nebular HeII emission. We discuss observations of the
template low-metallicity galaxy I Zw 18 and suggest that the HeII nebula in
this galaxy is powered by a hot superbubble. Finally, appreciating the complex
nature of stellar feedback, we suggest that soft X-rays from hot superbubbles

Phys. A: Math. Theor. 54, 115301 (2021)) across a PT-transition. We present an
algebraic identification of the parameter space for the maximum violation of
LGI (in particular $K_{3}$). In the PT-symmetric regime the maximum allowed
value for $K_{3}$ is always found to be greater than the quantum bound
(L\""{u}ders bound) of $3/2$ but it does not reach the algebraic maximum of
$K_{3}=3$ in general. However, in the limit where PT-symmetry breaking
parameter approaches the exceptional point from the PT-symmetric side, $K_{3}$
is found to asymptotically approach its algebraic maximum of 3. In contrast,
the maximum value of $K_{3}$ always reaches its algebraic maximum in the
PT-broken phase $i.e.$ $K_{3}\rightarrow 3$. We find that (i) the speed of
evolution (SOE) must reach its maximum value (in the parameter space of initial
state and the time interval between successive measurements) to facilitate the
value of $K_{3} \rightarrow 3$, (ii) together with the constraint that its
minimum value must run into SOE equals to zero during the evolution of the
state. In fact we show that the minimum speed of evolution can serve as an
order parameter which is finite on the PT-symmetric side and identically zero
on the PT-broken side. Finally, we discuss a possible experimental realization
of this dynamics by quantum measurement followed by post-selection procedure in
a three level atom coupled to cavity mode undergoing a Lindbladian dynamics.

atmospheres, the large time-scale separation required in simulating the wide
range in electrical conductivity between the dayside and nightside has made it
difficult to run fully consistent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. This has
led to many studies that resort to drag parametrizations of MHD. In this study,
we revisit the question of the Lorentz force as an effective drag by running a
series of direct numerical simulations of a weakly rotating, poorly conducting
flow in the presence of a misaligned, strong background magnetic field. We find
that the drag parametrization fails once the time-scale associated with the
Lorentz force becomes shorter than the dynamical time-scale in the system,
beyond which the effective drag coefficient remains roughly constant, despite
orders-of-magnitude variation in the Lorentz (magnetic) time-scale. We offer an
improvement to the drag parametrization by considering the relevant asymptotic
limit of low conductivity and strong background magnetic field, known as the
quasi-static MHD approximation of the Lorentz force. This approximation removes
the fast time-scale associated with magnetic diffusion, but retains a more
complex version of the Lorentz force, which could be utilized in future
numerical models of hot Jupiter atmospheric circulation.

between two parties connected by an insecure quantum channel. To use a QKD
protocol in practice, one has to prove that it is secure against general
attacks: even if an adversary performs a complicated attack involving all of
the rounds of the protocol, they cannot gain useful information about the key.
A much simpler task is to prove security against collective attacks, where the
adversary is assumed to behave the same in each round. Using a recently
developed information-theoretic tool called generalised entropy accumulation,
we show that for a very broad class of QKD protocols, security against
collective attacks implies security against general attacks. Compared to
existing techniques such as the quantum de Finetti theorem or a previous
version of entropy accumulation, our result can be applied much more broadly
and easily: it does not require special assumptions on the protocol such as
symmetry or a Markov property between rounds, its bounds are independent of the

prepare-and-measure protocols directly without switching to an

two algorithms, one-dimensional CLEAN and Least Square Spectral Analysis

test these algorithms using the simulated SKA-1 low observations in the
presence of different RFI flagging scenarios. We find that in the presence of
random flagging of data, both algorithms perform well and can mitigate the
foreground leakage issue. But, CLEAN fails to restrict the foreground leakage
in the presence of periodic and periodic plus broadband RFI flagging and gives
an extra bias to the estimated power spectrum. However, LSSA can restrict the
foreground leakage for these RFI flagging scenarios and gives an unbiased

way of helping these users is to automatically synthesize the SQL query given a

SQL have been proposed, but none of the current tools take advantage of the
increased number of cores per processor. This paper proposes CUBES, a parallel
program synthesizer for the domain of SQL queries using input-output examples.
CUBES extends current sequential query synthesizers with new pruning techniques
and a divide-and-conquer approach, splitting the search space into smaller
independent sub-problems.
  Examples are an under-specification, and the synthesized query may not match
the user's intent. We improve the accuracy of CUBES by developing a
disambiguation procedure based on fuzzing that interacts with the user and
increases our confidence that the returned query matches the user intent.
  We perform an extensive evaluation on around 4000 SQL queries from different
domains. Experimental results show that our sequential version can solve more
instances than other state-of-the-art SQL synthesizers. Moreover, the parallel
approach can scale up to 16 processes with super-linear speedups for many hard

inflexible and slow to adapt to changing threats. This paper introduces an
alternate approach called open mandates, which mandate that vendors must
dedicate some amount of resources (e.g. system speed, energy, design cost,
etc.) towards security but unlike checklist security does not prescribe
specific controls that must be implemented. The goal of open mandates is to
provide flexibility to vendors in implementing security controls that they see
fit while requiring all vendors to commit to a certain level of security. In
this paper, we first demonstrate the usefulness of open security mandates: for
instance, we show that mandating 10% of resources towards security reduces
defenders losses by 8% and forestalls attackers by 10%. We then show how open
mandates can be implemented in practice. Specifically, we solve the problem of
identifying a system's overhead due to security, a key problem towards making
such an open mandate enforceable in practice. As examples we demonstrate our
open mandate system -- COMMAND -- for two contemporary software hardening
techniques and show that our methodology can predict security overheads to a
very high degree of accuracy (<1% mean and median error) with low resource
requirements. We also present experiments that quantify, in terms of dollars,
how much end users value the performance lost to security, which help determine
the costs of such a program. Taken together -- the usefulness of mandates,
their enforceability, and their quantifiable costs -- make the case for an

computation cost, but struggles to bring practical speedup to the model

dense computation, but exploiting tensor-cores for sparse DNNs is very
challenging. Compared to existing CUDA-cores, tensor-cores require higher data
reuse and matrix-shaped instruction granularity, both difficult to yield from
sparse DNN kernels. Existing pruning approaches fail to balance the demands of
accuracy and efficiency: random sparsity preserves the model quality well but
prohibits tensor-core acceleration, while highly-structured block-wise sparsity
can exploit tensor-cores but suffers from severe accuracy loss.
  In this work, we propose a novel sparse pattern, Shuffled Block-wise sparsity
(Shfl-BW), designed to efficiently utilize tensor-cores while minimizing the
constraints on the weight structure. Our insight is that row- and column-wise

introduces negligible overheads using our GPU kernel designs. We optimize the
GPU kernels for Shfl-BW in linear and convolution layers. Evaluations show that

existing works employ linear quantization which causes considerable degradation
in accuracy for weight bit widths lower than 8. Since the distribution of
weights is usually non-uniform (with most weights concentrated around zero),
other methods, such as logarithmic quantization, are more suitable as they are
able to preserve the shape of the weight distribution more precise. Moreover,
using base-2 logarithmic representation allows optimizing the multiplication by
replacing it with bit shifting. In this paper, we explore non-linear
quantization techniques for exploiting lower bit precision and identify
favorable hardware implementation options. We developed the Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) algorithm that allowed training of low bit width Power-of-Two
(PoT) networks and achieved accuracies on par with state-of-the-art floating

and investigated hardware designs of MAC units for three different quantization
schemes - uniform, PoT and Additive-PoT (APoT) - to show the increased
efficiency when using the proposed approach. Eventually, the experiments showed
that for low bit width precision, non-uniform quantization performs better than
uniform, and at the same time, PoT quantization vastly reduces the
computational complexity of the neural network.

each domain's training samples come with domain labels (e.g., painting, photo).
Samples from each domain are assumed to follow the same distribution and the
domain labels are exploited to learn domain-invariant features via feature
alignment. However, such an assumption often does not hold true -- there often
exist numerous finer-grained domains (e.g., dozens of modern painting styles
have been developed, each differing dramatically from those of the classic
styles). Therefore, forcing feature distribution alignment across each
artificially-defined and coarse-grained domain can be ineffective. In this
paper, we address both single-source and multi-source UDA from a completely
different perspective, which is to view each instance as a fine domain. Feature
alignment across domains is thus redundant. Instead, we propose to perform
dynamic instance domain adaptation (DIDA). Concretely, a dynamic neural network
with adaptive convolutional kernels is developed to generate instance-adaptive
residuals to adapt domain-agnostic deep features to each individual instance.
This enables a shared classifier to be applied to both source and target domain
data without relying on any domain annotation. Further, instead of imposing
intricate feature alignment losses, we adopt a simple semi-supervised learning
paradigm using only a cross-entropy loss for both labeled source and pseudo
labeled target data. Our model, dubbed DIDA-Net, achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several commonly used single-source and multi-source UDA

structure of the emission spectrum is attenuated by the presence of coherent
phonons, and is no longer comprised of discrete harmonic orders, but rather of
a continuous emission in the plateau region. The HHG yield strongly oscillates
as a function of the pump-probe delay, corresponding to ultrafast changes in
the lattice such as bond compression or stretching. We further show that in the
regime where the excited phonon period and the pulse duration are of the same
order of magnitude, the HHG process becomes sensitive to the
carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of the driving field, even though the pulse
duration is so long that no such sensitivity is observed in the absence of
coherent phonons. The degree of CEP sensitivity vs. pump-probe delay is shown
to be a highly selective measure for instantaneous structural changes in the

rate anisotropy. We conclude that Planckian dissipation is anomalous in its
temperature dependence but not in its field dependence. The scattering rate in
these cuprates does not depend on field, which means their Planckian
dissipation is robust against fields up to at least 85 T.

associations have revealed that a large portion ($\sim$ 70%) of these massive
stars (M$_{i}$ $\gt$ 15 $M_{\odot}$) belong to close and short-period binaries
(physical separation d $\lt$few au). Despite the recent and significant
progress, the formation mechanisms leading to such close massive multiple
systems remain to be elucidated. As a result, young massive close binaries (or
higher-order multiple systems) are unique laboratories to figure out the
pairing mechanism of high-mass stars. We present the first VLTI/GRAVITY
observations of six young O stars in the M17 star-forming region ($\lesssim$ 1
Myr) and two additional foreground stars. From the interferometric model
fitting of visibility amplitudes and closure phases, we search for companions
and measure their positions and flux ratios. Combining the resulting magnitude
difference with atmosphere models and evolutionary tracks, we further constrain
the masses of the individual components. All of the six high-mass stars are in
multiple systems, leading to a multiplicity fraction (MF) of 100%, yielding a
68% confidence interval of 94-100%. We detect a total number of 9 companions
with separations up to 120 au. Including previously identified spectroscopic
companions, the companion fraction of the young O stars in our sample reaches
2.3$\pm$0.6. The derived masses span a wide range from 2.5 to 50 $M_{\odot}$,
with a great tendency towards high-mass companions. While based on a modest
sample, our results clearly indicate that the origin of the high degree of
multiplicity is rooted in their star formation mechanism. No clear evidence for
one of the competing concepts of massive star formation (core accretion or
competitive accretion) could be found. However, our results are compatible with
migration as a scenario for the formation of close massive binaries.

increased the demand for improving the capabilities to simulate the packed beds

computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations time consuming and costly.
Intermediate fidelity porous media models, however, are capable of
approximating these flow fields in a much more computationally efficient
manner. These models require the use of closures to capture the effects of
complex flow phenomena without modeling them explicitly. This research employs
data obtained from high-fidelity CFD simulations of a pebble bed to improve the
drag closures used in porous media models in the near-wall region of the bed.
Specifically, NekRS, a GPU-enabled spectral element CFD code, was used to
simulate a bed of 1,568 pebbles at multiple Reynolds numbers. The case was
divided into five concentric subdomains to extract radial profiles of the
average porosity, velocity, and wall shear in each subdomain. A model
consistent with the high-fidelity model was created in Idaho National
Laboratory's Pronghorn porous media code and the KTA correlation was chosen as
the drag closure of comparison. It was found that the KTA correlation
overestimates the velocity in the near-wall region. An investigation of the
drag coefficients between the two codes revealed that the KTA correlation
underestimated the form factor in the outermost region while overestimating it
in the inner four regions. This analysis in this work has revealed the
underlying inaccuracy in the near-wall region of the KTA correlation and has
set up the process for using high-fidelity simulation to predict more accurate
drag coefficients a priori, rather than with a manual velocity-matching
approach. This process will allow for the development of an improved drag
closure for use in porous media models.

effects of the gravitational field of the galaxy hosting a central black hole,
and of electron scattering in the optically thin limit. Here we apply this
extended Bondi problem, in the general polytropic case, to a class of new
two-component galaxy models recently presented. In these models, a Jaffe
stellar density profile is embedded in a dark matter halo such that the total
density distribution follows a $r^{-3}$ profile at large radii; the stellar
dynamical quantities can be expressed in a fully analytical way. The
hydrodynamical properties of the flow are set by imposing that the gas
temperature at infinity is proportional to the virial temperature of the
stellar component. The isothermal and adiabatic (monoatomic) cases can be
solved analytically, in the other cases we explore the accretion solution
numerically. As non-adiabatic accretion inevitably leads to an exchange of heat
with the ambient, we also discuss some important thermodynamical properties of
the polytropic Bondi accretion, and provide the expressions needed to compute
the amount of heat exchanged with the environment, as a function of radius. The
results can be useful for the subgrid treatment of accretion in numerical
simulations, as well as for the interpretation of observational data.

organizations is growing rapidly due to the onset of deep learning and the
widespread availability of training data. Though tests of face recognition
algorithm performance indicate yearly performance gains, error rates for many
of these systems differ based on the demographic composition of the test set.
These ""demographic differentials"" in algorithm performance can contribute to
unequal or unfair outcomes for certain groups of people, raising concerns with
increased worldwide adoption of face recognition systems. Consequently,
regulatory bodies in both the United States and Europe have proposed new rules
requiring audits of biometric systems for ""discriminatory impacts"" (European
Union Artificial Intelligence Act) and ""fairness"" (U.S. Federal Trade
Commission). However, no standard for measuring fairness in biometric systems
yet exists. This paper characterizes two proposed measures of face recognition
algorithm fairness (fairness measures) from scientists in the U.S. and Europe.
We find that both proposed methods are challenging to interpret when applied to
disaggregated face recognition error rates as they are commonly experienced in
practice. To address this, we propose a set of interpretability criteria,
termed the Functional Fairness Measure Criteria (FFMC), that outlines a set of
properties desirable in a face recognition algorithm fairness measure. We
further develop a new fairness measure, the Gini Aggregation Rate for Biometric
Equitability (GARBE), and show how, in conjunction with the Pareto
optimization, this measure can be used to select among alternative algorithms
based on the accuracy/fairness trade-space. Finally, we have open-sourced our

believe this is currently the largest open-source dataset of its kind.

that contain only a single lossy material in their interior, the
niobium/niobium oxide interface. The best fits show interacting TLSs with a
sharp modulus of electric dipole moment for both thin (5 nm) and thick (100 nm)

motif, harbor an array of intriguing phenomena such as chiral charge order and
superconductivity. CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is of particular interest because it displays
a double superconducting dome in the region of the temperature-pressure phase
diagram where charge order is still present. However, the microscopic origin of
such an unusual behavior remains an unsolved issue. Here, to address it, we
combine high-pressure, low-temperature muon spin relaxation with
first-principles calculations. We observe a pressure-induced threefold
enhancement of the superfluid density, which also displays a double peak
feature, similar to the superconducting critical temperature. This leads to
three distinct regions in the phase diagram, each of which features distinct
slopes of the linear relation between superfluid density and the critical
temperature. These results are attributed to a possible evolution of the charge
order pattern from the superimposed tri-hexagonal Star-of-David phase at low
pressures (within the first dome) to the staggered tri-hexagonal phase at
intermediate pressures (between the first and second domes). Our findings
suggest a change in the nature of the charge ordered state across the phase
diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, with varying degrees of competition with
superconductivity.

However, even if the segments themselves are completable and well-formed,

broken in-game structures (e.g. malformed pipes in Mario). We show this with
three tile-based games: a side-scrolling platformer, a vertical platformer, and

roughly saturates this bound. Computing the price requires computing modular
flowed correlators with respect to the density matrix associated to a subset of

decoherence need to be characterized in detail for designing the control of
quantum devices to mitigate the loss of quantum information. However, quantum
sensing of such environments is still a challenge due to their non-stationary
nature that in general can generate complex high-order correlations. We here
introduce a path integral framework to characterize non-stationary
environmental fluctuations by a quantum probe. We found the solution for the
decoherence decay of non-stationary, generalized Gaussian processes that induce
pure dephasing. This dephasing when expressed in a suitable basis, based on the
non-stationary noise eigenmodes, is defined by the overlap of a generalized
noise spectral density and a filter function that depends on the control
fields. This result thus extends the validity to out-of-equilibrium
environments, of the similar general expression for the dephasing of open
quantum systems coupled to stationary noises. We show physical insights for a
broad subclass of non-stationary noises that are local-in-time, in the sense
that the noise correlation functions contain memory based on constraints of the
derivatives of the fluctuating noise paths. Spectral and non-Markovian
properties are discussed together with implementations of the framework to
treat paradigmatic environments that are out-of-equilibrium, e.g. due to a
quench and a pulsed noise. We show that our results provide tools for probing
the spectral and time-correlation properties, and for mitigating decoherence

helioseismology, may be related to internal solar rotation. A nuclear-decay
experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory (for 1982-86) reveals strong
oscillations at 11.2 and 13.2 yr$^{-1}$. Similar oscillations are found in
nuclear-decay measurements conducted by A. Parkhomov. By contrast, S. Pomme
points out that nuclear-decay experiments at standards laboratories tend not to
exhibit variability. The most extensive series of nuclear-decay measurements
comes from an experiment initiated by G. Steinitz at the Geological Survey of
Israel (2007-16), which recorded 340,000 radon-related measurements from each
of 3 gamma detectors and 3 environmental sensors. Analysis of a subset of
85,000 hourly gamma measurements reveals a number of oscillation frequencies
compatible with influences of internal solar rotation. There is no correlation
between the gamma and environmental measurements. The solar internal magnetic
field may lead to neutrino modulation by the RSFP (Resonant Spin-Flavor
Precession) mechanism. A triplet of oscillations (7.43, 8.43 and 9.43
yr$^{-1}$) may be attributed to an internal region (presumably the core) with a
sidereal rotation rate of 8.43 yr$^{-1}$ and a rotation axis roughly orthogonal
to that of the photosphere. This suggests that the Sun had its origin in more
than one stage of condensation of interplanetary material (one on top of
another), which could lead to present-day layers with different metallicities,
rotation rates and axes. The peak modulation occurs near local midnight in
early June, suggestive of a role of cosmic neutrinos. These neutrinos could

these methods in terms of generalization accuracy by solving the 2D
time-dependent Brusselator reaction-diffusion system with uncertainty sources,
modeling an autocatalytic chemical reaction between two species. We first
propose an extension of the m-PCE by constructing a mapping between latent
spaces formed by two separate embeddings of input functions and output QoIs. To
enhance the accuracy of the DeepONet, we introduce weight self-adaptivity in
the loss function. We demonstrate that the performance of m-PCE and DeepONet is
comparable for cases of relatively smooth input-output mappings. However, when
highly non-smooth dynamics is considered, DeepONet shows higher accuracy. We
also find that for m-PCE, modest over-parameterization leads to better
generalization, both within and outside of distribution, whereas aggressive
over-parameterization leads to over-fitting. In contrast, an even highly
over-parameterized DeepONet leads to better generalization for both smooth and
non-smooth dynamics. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the above
models with another operator learning model, the Fourier Neural Operator, and
show that its over-parameterization also leads to better generalization. Our
studies show that m-PCE can provide very good accuracy at very low training

has inspired a myriad of implementations. While previous work has produced
breakthroughs in shuffle performance, many applications do not benefit in
practice because of the difficulty of evolving existing shuffle systems.
Shuffle is often tightly integrated into a framework that offers a higher-level
abstraction such as SQL. Integrating new shuffle designs into these frameworks
requires significant development effort. Furthermore, distributed shuffle is
used by many different end use cases, from high-throughput batch processing to
low-latency online aggregation. These different use cases have driven the
creation of new application frameworks, each of which must rebuild shuffle from
scratch.
  We enable shuffle flexibility by building distributed shuffle as a library.
We use distributed futures as an intermediate layer for building distributed
shuffle as a library and show how it enables the shuffle control plane to be
decoupled from a common high-performance data plane based on Ray. We present
Exoshuffle and show that we can: (1) rewrite previous shuffle optimizations as
application-level libraries with an order of magnitude less code, (2) build a
shuffle-agnostic data plane that provides performance and scalability
competitive with specialized shuffle systems, and (3) enable latest
applications such as ML training to easily leverage large-scale distributed

opposite directions, utilizing powerful decoder model for generating realistic

coefficient for disentangling representation but ultimately generating blurry
examples. Existing methods narrow the issues to the rate-distortion trade-off
between compression and reconstruction. We argue that a good reconstruction
model does learn high capacity latents that encode more details, however, its
use is hindered by two major issues: the prior is random noise which is
completely detached from the posterior and allow no controllability in the
generation; mean-field variational inference doesn't enforce hierarchy
structure which makes the task of recombining those units into plausible novel
output infeasible. As a result, we develop a system that learns a hierarchy of
disentangled representation together with a mechanism for recombining the
learned representation for generalization. This is achieved by introducing a
minimal amount of inductive bias to learn controllable prior for the VAE. The
idea is supported by here developed transitive information theory, that is, the
mutual information between two target variables could alternately be maximized
through the mutual information to the third variable, thus bypassing the
rate-distortion bottleneck in VAE design. In particular, we show that our
model, named SemafoVAE (inspired by the similar concept in computer science),

traversals of the disentangled factors and intervention at a different level of

Weymouth equation is commonly implemented in literature to avoid dealing with
the mathematical complications of solving the original governing differential

this approach is not reliable in the short-term operation problem. Here, the
merit of the non-convex transient model is compared with the simplified

Albert Einstein to emerge and propagate through the universe as the result of
collisions between black holes and other massive objects in deep space. The
extreme complexity and precision of such detectors causes them to be subject to

detector data without needing to observe the anomalies themselves. We also
illustrate several other useful features of the model, including how it
performs automatic variable selection to reduce tens of thousands of auxiliary

Interestingly, the absence of long-range screening in the two-dimensional (2D)

produce a large number of particles along the beam collision axis, outside of
the acceptance of existing LHC experiments. The proposed Forward Physics
Facility (FPF), to be located several hundred meters from the ATLAS interaction
point and shielded by concrete and rock, will host a suite of experiments to
probe Standard Model (SM) processes and search for physics beyond the Standard
Model (BSM). In this report, we review the status of the civil engineering
plans and the experiments to explore the diverse physics signals that can be
uniquely probed in the forward region. FPF experiments will be sensitive to a
broad range of BSM physics through searches for new particle scattering or
decay signatures and deviations from SM expectations in high statistics
analyses with TeV neutrinos in this low-background environment. High statistics
neutrino detection will also provide valuable data for fundamental topics in
perturbative and non-perturbative QCD and in weak interactions. Experiments at
the FPF will enable synergies between forward particle production at the LHC
and astroparticle physics to be exploited. We report here on these physics
topics, on infrastructure, detector, and simulation studies, and on future
directions to realize the FPF's physics potential.

attention and we studied the original discovery paper of YY Dra by Tsesevich
(Zessewitch). We found that two out of four variables reported by him were
either lost or improperly studied. The coordinate offset from the correct
position in another object was much larger than the expected error. Using the
information of the published period and epoch of YY Dra, we suspect that
Tsesevich used a couple of plates on which the object was invisible to derive
the period rather than from a completely phased light curve. DO Dra sometimes
spends high states around 14 mag for a month to several months and it would not
be surprising if Tsesevich observed DO Dra in such a state and suspected it to
be an Algol, urging him to examine the plate archive to obtain the moments when
the variable was undetected. We suspect that Tsesevich indeed observed DO Dra,
rather than a different, lost eclipsing variable. The final conclusion of this
matter is almost impossible to reach due to the consequence of the World War
II, destructing the large part of plate collections. Until the humanity becomes
wise enough to restore this destruction and wise enough to be able to avoid
further destruction of human achievements, the designation YY Dra would better
be conserved as a record of our negative history and unambiguous DO Dra would
better be used to designate the intermediate polar 3A 1148+719.

Wasserstein distance to $\mu$. Namely, there exists a coupling of $\mu$ and

pair drawn from this coupling, then $n^{-1}\mathbb

Bodineau and by Eldan, Koehler, and Zeitouni, implied efficient algorithms to
approximately sample (under a stronger metric) for $\beta<1/4$.
  We complement this result with a negative one, by introducing a suitable
""stability"" property for sampling algorithms, which is verified by many
standard techniques. We prove that no stable algorithm can approximately sample
for $\beta>1$, even under the normalized Wasserstein metric.
  Our sampling method is based on an algorithmic implementation of stochastic

multicomponent flows with transport phenomena of mass, momentum and energy
(i.e., mass diffusion, viscous dissipation and heat conduction). The model is
reduced from the seven-equation Baer-Nuziato type model with asymptotic
analysis in the limit of instantaneous mechanical relaxations. The main
difference between the present model and the Kapila's five-equation model
consists in that different time scales for pressure and velocity relaxations
are assumed, the former being much smaller than the latter. Thanks to this
assumption, the velocity disequilibrium is retained to model the mass diffusion
process. Aided by the diffusion laws, the final model still formally consists
of five equations. The proposed model satisfy two desirable properties : (1) it
respects the laws of thermodynamics, (2) it is free of the spurious oscillation
problem in the vicinity of the diffused interface zone. The mass diffusion,
viscous dissipation and heat conduction processes contribute parabolic partial
differential equations that are solved with the Chebyshev method of local
iterations. Numerical results show that the proposed model maintains pressure,
velocity and temperature equilibrium near the diffused interface. Convergence
tests demonstrate that the numerical methods achieve second order in space and
time. The proposed model and numerical methods are applied to simulate the
laser-driven RM instability problem in inertial confinement fusion, good
agreement with experimental results are observed.

temporal, structural, and contextual information on temporal graphs. The
generated temporal node embeddings outperform other methods in many downstream
tasks. Real-world applications require high performance inference on real-time
streaming dynamic graphs. However, these models usually rely on complex
attention mechanisms to capture relationships between temporal neighbors. In
addition, maintaining vertex memory suffers from intrinsic temporal data
dependency that hinders task-level parallelism, making it inefficient on
general-purpose processors. In this work, we present a novel model-architecture
co-design for inference in memory-based TGNNs on FPGAs. The key modeling
optimizations we propose include a light-weight method to compute attention
scores and a related temporal neighbor pruning strategy to further reduce
computation and memory accesses. These are holistically coupled with key
hardware optimizations that leverage FPGA hardware. We replace the temporal
sampler with an on-chip FIFO based hardware sampler and the time encoder with a
look-up-table. We train our simplified models using knowledge distillation to
ensure similar accuracy vis-\'a-vis the original model. Taking advantage of the
model optimizations, we propose a principled hardware architecture using
batching, pipelining, and prefetching techniques to further improve the
performance. We also propose a hardware mechanism to ensure the chronological
vertex updating without sacrificing the computation parallelism. We evaluate
the performance of the proposed hardware accelerator on three real-world

heterogeneous formats and methods that allow critical kernels, e.g., SpMV, to
be executed on different devices with portable performance and minimal changes
to format and method. This paper presents a heterogeneous format based on CSR,
named CSR-k, that can be tuned quickly and outperforms the average performance
of Intel MKL on Intel Xeon Platinum 8380 and AMD Epyc 7742 CPUs while still

commonly generated from two and three-dimensional finite difference and element

rows into a hierarchical structure of super-rows and super-super-rows that are
represented by just a few extra arrays of pointers. Due to its simplicity, a
model can be tuned for a device and used to select super-row and

all feasible parameters $\{N_1, N_2, T\}$ that exploit the fact that the relay
naturally observes the erasure pattern occurring in the link from source to
relay, thus it can adapt its relaying strategy based on these observations. In
a recent work, Fong et al. provide streaming codes featuring
channel-state-independent relaying strategies. The codes proposed in this paper
achieve rates higher than the ones proposed by Fong et al. whenever $N_2 >

Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model of epidemic propagation, in the

approximating arbitrary epidemics. We first establish the differential
equations defining the age-structured SIR model as the mean-field limits of a
continuous-time Markov process that models epidemic spreading on a social

population size grows, the infection rate for any pair of age groups converges
to its mean-field limit if and only if the edge update rate of the network
approaches infinity, and we show how the rate of mean-field convergence depends
on the edge update rate. We then propose a system identification method for
parameter estimation of the bilinear ODEs of our model, and we test the model
performance on a Japanese COVID-19 dataset by generating the trajectories of
the age-wise numbers of infected individuals in the prefecture of Tokyo for a

oscillation above the herringbone structures that advects heat and mass from
the top plane to herringbone structures. The second is a flow recirculation in
the grooves between herringbone ridges that advects heat and mass from the area
around herringbone tips to the side walls of herringbone ridges and the bottom

transport mechanisms. The results show that when advective heat and mass
transfer takes effect at relatively larger Reynolds and Schmidt numbers, the
dependence of the total transfer rate on the Schmidt number follows a power
law, with the power being the same as that in the Dittus-Boelter equation for
turbulent heat transfer. As Reynolds number increases, the dependence of the
total transfer rate on Reynolds number also approaches a power law, and the

Open Set TAL (OSTAL) problem and propose a general framework OpenTAL based on
Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). Specifically, the OpenTAL consists of
uncertainty-aware action classification, actionness prediction, and temporal
location regression. With the proposed importance-balanced EDL method,
classification uncertainty is learned by collecting categorical evidence
majorly from important samples. To distinguish the unknown actions from
background video frames, the actionness is learned by the positive-unlabeled
learning. The classification uncertainty is further calibrated by leveraging
the guidance from the temporal localization quality. The OpenTAL is general to
enable existing TAL models for open set scenarios, and experimental results on
THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.

respect to grounding to factual and up-to-date information. Motivated by
semi-parametric language models (LMs), which ground their decisions in external
retrieved evidence, we use few-shot prompting to learn to condition LMs on
information returned from the web using Google Search, a broad and constantly
updated knowledge source. Our approach does not involve fine-tuning or learning

a strong baseline. Indeed, we find that LMs conditioned on the web surpass
performance of closed-book models of similar, or even larger, model sizes in

inference-time compute of models, achieved via using multiple retrieved
evidences to generate multiple answers followed by a reranking stage that uses

lower performance of smaller few-shot LMs. All in all, our findings suggest
that it might be beneficial to slow down the race towards the biggest model and
instead shift attention towards finding more effective ways to use models,
including but not limited to, better prompting or increasing inference-time

introducing a novel saddle point sliding subroutine which only requires the
projection over the ambiguity set $P$. We observe that the number of
$P$-projections performed by DRAO-S is optimal. Moreover, we develop matching
lower complexity bounds to show the communication complexities of both DRAO and
DRAO-S to be improvable. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
encouraging empirical performance of the DRAO-S method.

We argue that contrastive learning
heavily relies on informative features, or ""hard"" (positive or negative)
features. Early works include more informative features by applying complex
data augmentations and large batch size or memory bank, and recent works design
elaborate sampling approaches to explore informative features. The key
challenge toward exploring such features is that the source multi-view data is
generated by applying random data augmentations, making it infeasible to always
add useful information in the augmented data. Consequently, the informativeness
of features learned from such augmented data is limited. In response, we
propose to directly augment the features in latent space, thereby learning
discriminative representations without a large amount of input data. We perform
a meta learning technique to build the augmentation generator that updates its
network parameters by considering the performance of the encoder. However,
insufficient input data may lead the encoder to learn collapsed features and
therefore malfunction the augmentation generator. A new margin-injected
regularization is further added in the objective function to avoid the encoder
learning a degenerate mapping. To contrast all features in one gradient
back-propagation step, we adopt the proposed optimization-driven unified
contrastive loss instead of the conventional contrastive loss. Empirically, our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.

elliptic observation operators. Commonly used EnKF regularization methods
suppress state correlations at long distances. For observations described by
elliptic partial differential equations, such as the pressure Poisson equation
(PPE) in incompressible fluid flows, distance localization cannot be applied,
as we cannot disentangle slowly decaying physical interactions from spurious
long-range correlations. This is particularly true for the PPE, in which
distant vortex elements couple nonlinearly to induce pressure. Instead, these
inverse problems have a low effective dimension: low-dimensional projections of
the observations strongly inform a low-dimensional subspace of the state space.
We derive a low-rank factorization of the Kalman gain based on the spectrum of
the Jacobian of the observation operator. The identified eigenvectors
generalize the source and target modes of the multipole expansion,
independently of the underlying spatial distribution of the problem. Given
rapid spectral decay, inference can be performed in the low-dimensional
subspace spanned by the dominant eigenvectors. This low-rank EnKF is assessed
on dynamical systems with Poisson observation operators, where we seek to
estimate the positions and strengths of point singularities over time from
potential or pressure observations. We also comment on the broader
applicability of this approach to elliptic inverse problems outside the context
of filtering.

one or more characters are cropped out. Considering that it is hard to
accurately decide word boundaries with only the detector, we propose a novel
Detection-agnostic End-to-End Recognizer, DEER, framework. The proposed method
reduces the tight dependency between detection and recognition modules by
bridging them with a single reference point for each text instance, instead of
using detected regions. The proposed method allows the decoder to recognize the
texts that are indicated by the reference point, with features from the whole

by an empirically chosen hyper-parameter. More recently, the dual-critic design

this issue, we introduce Neural Frank-Wolfe Policy Optimization (NFWPO) in
formulating the frame-level bit allocation as an action-constrained RL problem.
In this new framework, the rate critic serves to specify a feasible action set,

reconstruction quality while conforming to the action constraint. Experimental
results show that when trained to optimize the video multi-method assessment

Galactic Plane in all four ground-state transitions of the OH radical at 1612,

Molecular Zone and Galactic Centre over the range $|b|<$ 2$^{\circ}$,
332$^{\circ}$ $< l <$ 10$^{\circ}$, with a small extension between 2$^{\circ}$
$< b <$ 6$^{\circ}$, 358$^{\circ}$ $< l <$ 4$^{\circ}$. SPLASH is the most
sensitive large-scale survey of OH to-date, reaching a characteristic
root-mean-square sensitivity of $\sim15$ mK for an effective velocity
resolution of $\sim0.9$ km/s. The spectral line datacubes are optimised for the

We also present radio continuum images at 1612, 1666 and 1720 MHz. Based on
initial comparisons with $^{12}$CO(J=1-0), we find that OH rarely extends
outside CO cloud boundaries in our data, but suggest that large variations in
CO-to-OH brightness temperature ratios may reflect differences in the total gas
column density traced by each. Column density estimation in the complex,
continuum-bright Inner Galaxy is a challenge, and we demonstrate how failure to
appropriately model sub-beam structure and the line-of-sight source
distribution can lead to order-of-magnitude errors. Anomalous excitation of the
1612 and 1720 MHz satellite lines is ubiquitous in the inner Galaxy, but is
disabled by line overlap in and around the Central Molecular Zone.

the dependence structure of a joint distribution. In this work, a novel

auto-encoder constructs a manifold in the quotient space. Based on this

the proposed image model is effective for various self-supervised image

shareholders won't cover surplus shortfalls and a solvency constraint (as in
Paulsen, 2003) is consequently imposed, and (ii) when shareholders are always
to fund any capital deficiency with capital (asset) injections. In the latter

between dividends and capital injections.
  Developing and using appropriate verification lemmas, we show that the
optimal dividend strategy is, in both cases, of barrier type. Both value
functions are derived in closed form. Furthermore, the barrier is defined on
the ratio of assets to liabilities, which mimics some of the dividend
strategies that can be observed in practice by insurance companies. Existence

core-collapse simulation of a 17 solar-mass star by Zha \emph{et al.} (2021)

grid-forming inverters and grid-following inverters, it is crucial to develop
an efficient and effective assessment procedure besides available co-simulation
framework with high computation burdens. This paper presents a streamlined
graph-based topology assessment for the integrated power system transmission
and distribution networks. Graph analyses were performed based on the
integrated graph of modified miniWECC grid model and IEEE 8500-node test feeder
model, high performance computing platform with 40 nodes and total 2400 CPUs
has been utilized to process this integrated graph, which has 100,000+ nodes
and 10,000+ IBRs. The node ranking results not only verified the applicability
of the proposed method, but also revealed the potential of distributed grid
forming (GFM) and grid following (GFL) inverters interacting with the
centralized power plants.

devised a model of dynamic epistemic logic that is equivalent to the

unsolvability of a particular distributed task can be proven by finding a
formula, called logical obstruction. This logical method is very appealing
because the concrete formulas that prevent to solve task would have
implications of intuitive factors for the unsolvability. However, it has not
been well studied when a logical obstruction exists and how to systematically
construct a concrete logical obstruction formula, if any. In addition, it is
proved that there are some tasks that are solvable but do not admit logical

that the language of the standard epistemic logic, without distributed

lack of practical evaluation methods has hindered progress. Evaluation can be
defined as looking for defense models' lower bound of robustness given a budget
number of iterations and a test dataset. A practical evaluation method should
be convenient (i.e., parameter-free), efficient (i.e., fewer iterations) and
reliable (i.e., approaching the lower bound of robustness). Towards this
target, we propose a parameter-free Adaptive Auto Attack (A$^3$) evaluation
method which addresses the efficiency and reliability in a test-time-training
fashion. Specifically, by observing that adversarial examples to a specific
defense model follow some regularities in their starting points, we design an
Adaptive Direction Initialization strategy to speed up the evaluation.
Furthermore, to approach the lower bound of robustness under the budget number
of iterations, we propose an online statistics-based discarding strategy that
automatically identifies and abandons hard-to-attack images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our A$^3$. Particularly, we apply
A$^3$ to nearly 50 widely-used defense models. By consuming much fewer
iterations than existing methods, i.e., $1/10$ on average (10$\times$ speed
up), we achieve lower robust accuracy in all cases. Notably, we won

gravitational theories in the strong field regime. As the first-order
modifications from quantum gravity, the nonlocality can be manifested by black
hole shadow and gravitational lensing. For example, the cut-off parameter
introduced by nonlocality will affect the shape and size of the black hole
shadow, and also affect the deflection angle of light rays. In this paper, we
mainly investigate the effects of the nonlocality on the black hole shadow and
the gravitational lensing for two types of rotating black holes in nonlocal
gravity. It is found that the size of the black hole shadow decreases with the
cut-off parameter since the nonlocality weakens the gravitational constant, and
the shape of the shadow gets more deformed with the increase of the cut-off
parameter. However, if the rotation parameter is small, the shape of the shadow
is almost a circle even though the cut-off parameter approaches its maximum.
The energy emission rate in both models is also studied. The results show that
there is a peak for each curve and the peak decreases and shifts to the low
frequency with the increase of the cut-off parameter. Besides, we also explore
the shadow of both types of black holes surrounded by a nonmagnetized
pressureless plasma which satisfies the separability condition. It is found
that the plasma has a frequency-dependent dispersive effect on the size and
shape of the black hole shadow. For the gravitational lensing, we find that the
cut-off parameter of model A makes a positive contribution to the deflection
angle, which can be compared with the contribution of the rotation parameter,
while the cut-off parameter of model B makes a negative contribution which can
be ignored. These results may be helpful for probing nonlocal gravity in future
observations.

have the leader only propose transaction ids. Stratus uses a provably available

  We implemented and evaluated Stratus by integrating it with state-of-the-art

nodes of a network modeled as a graph to meet at the same node. Agents have
different labels which are integers from a set $\{1,\dots,L\}$. They wake up at
possibly different times and move in synchronous rounds. In each round, an
agent can either stay idle or move to an adjacent node. We consider
deterministic rendezvous algorithms. The time of such an algorithm is the
number of rounds since the wakeup of the earlier agent till the meeting. In
this paper we consider rendezvous in infinite trees. Our main goal is to study
the impact of orientation of a tree on the time of rendezvous.
  We first design a rendezvous algorithm working for unoriented regular trees,
whose time is in $O(z(D) \log L)$, where $z(D)$ is the size of the ball of
radius $D$, i.e, the number of nodes at distance at most $D$ from a given node.
The algorithm works for arbitrary delay between waking times of agents and does
not require any initial information about parameters $L$ or $D$. Its
disadvantage is its complexity: $z(D)$ is exponential in $D$ for any degree
$d>2$ of the tree. We prove that this high complexity is inevitable:
$\Omega(z(D))$ turns out to be a lower bound on rendezvous time in unoriented
regular trees, even for simultaneous start and even when agents know $L$ and
$D$. Then we turn attention to oriented trees. While for arbitrary delay
between waking times of agents the lower bound $\Omega(z(D))$ still holds, for
simultaneous start the time of rendezvous can be dramatically shortened. We
show that if agents know either a polynomial upper bound on $L$ or a linear
upper bound on $D$, then rendezvous can be accomplished in oriented trees in
time $O(D\log L)$, which is optimal. When no such extra knowledge is available,
we design an algorithm working in time $O(D^2+\log ^2L)$.

containers are challenging issues. To orchestrate a multitude of containers,
several orchestration tools are developed. But, many of these orchestration
tools are heavy-weight and have a high overhead, especially for
resource-limited Edge/Fog nodes. Thus, for hybrid computing environments,

physical sciences, allowing for the ability to model the dynamics of complex
systems with a prescribed accuracy. The approximations used in deriving
governing equations often result in discrepancies between the model and
sensor-based measurements of the system, revealing the approximate nature of
the equations and/or the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor itself. In modern
dynamical systems, such discrepancies between model and measurement can lead to
poor quantification, often undermining the ability to produce accurate and
precise control algorithms. We introduce a discrepancy modeling framework to
resolve deterministic model-measurement mismatch with two distinct approaches:
(i) by learning a model for the evolution of systematic state-space residual,
and (ii) by discovering a model for the missing deterministic physics.
Regardless of approach, a common suite of data-driven model discovery methods
can be used. Specifically, we use four fundamentally different methods to
demonstrate the mathematical implementations of discrepancy modeling: (i) the
sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), (ii) dynamic mode
decomposition (DMD), (iii) Gaussian process regression (GPR), and (iv) neural
networks (NN). The choice of method depends on one's intent for discrepancy
modeling, as well as quantity and quality of the sensor measurements. We
demonstrate the utility and suitability for both discrepancy modeling
approaches using the suite of data-driven modeling methods on three dynamical
systems under varying signal-to-noise ratios. We compare reconstruction and
forecasting accuracies and provide detailed comparatives, allowing one to
select the appropriate approach and method in practice.

regularities of integrals having singular and nonsingular integrands. We then
prove the maximum principle for the corresponding state-constrained optimal

bugs automatically in the last decade. Although recent researches have made
significant progress on the effectiveness and efficiency, it is still unclear
how APR techniques perform with human intervention in a real debugging
scenario. To bridge this gap, we conduct an extensive study to compare three
state-of-the-art APR tools with manual program repair, and further investigate
whether the assistance of APR tools (i.e., repair reports) can improve manual
program repair. To that end, we recruit 20 participants for a controlled
experiment, resulting in a total of 160 manual repair tasks and a questionnaire
survey. The experiment reveals several notable observations that (1) manual
program repair may be influenced by the frequency of repair actions sometimes;
(2) APR tools are more efficient in terms of debugging time, while manual
program repair tends to generate a correct patch with fewer attempts; (3) APR
tools can further improve manual program repair regarding the number of
correctly-fixed bugs, while there exists a negative impact on the patch
correctness; (4) participants are used to consuming more time to identify
incorrect patches, while they are still misguided easily; (5) participants are
positive about the tools' repair performance, while they generally lack
confidence about the usability in practice. Besides, we provide some guidelines
for improving the usability of APR tools (e.g., the misleading information in
reports and the observation of feedback).

hybridization of electronic states. Here, we investigate such strongly

resolved in scanning tunneling spectroscopy down to 500~mK, reflects a hybrid

the NbSe$_2$ substrate and that induced by proximity in WTe$_2$,

each filter specialises in extracting n-grams features of a particular input
word embedding. The input word embeddings, also called sentence matrix, is
treated as a matrix where each row is a word vector. Thus, it allows the model
to apply one-dimensional convolution and only extract n-gram based features

Better alignment of chains leads to an increased strength of the fiber. It is

uniaxial stretching of semicrystalline ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene.
We discovered that there is an optimal number of entanglements per
macromolecule necessary to maximize chain orientation in a fiber. Polymers that
were entangled too strongly formed less oriented fibers. On the other hand,
when polymers had too few entanglements per chain, they disentangled during
stretching, and the strong fiber was not formed. We constructed a microscopic
analytical theory describing both the fiber formation and disentanglement

  Visual Grounding",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, one-stage visual grounders attract high attention due to the
comparable accuracy but significantly higher efficiency than two-stage
grounders. However, inter-object relation modeling has not been well studied
for one-stage grounders. Inter-object relationship modeling, though important,
is not necessarily performed among all the objects within the image, as only a
part of them are related to the text query and may confuse the model. We call
these objects ""suspected objects"". However, exploring relationships among these
suspected objects in the one-stage visual grounding paradigm is non-trivial due
to two core problems: (1) no object proposals are available as the basis on
which to select suspected objects and perform relationship modeling; (2)
compared with those irrelevant to the text query, suspected objects are more
confusing, as they may share similar semantics, be entangled with certain
relationships, etc, and thereby more easily mislead the model's prediction. To
address the above issues, this paper proposes a Suspected Object Graph (SOG)
approach to encourage the correct referred object selection among the suspected
ones in the one-stage visual grounding. Suspected objects are dynamically
selected from a learned activation map as nodes to adapt to the current
discrimination ability of the model during training. Afterward, on top of the
suspected objects, a Keyword-aware Node Representation module (KNR) and an
Exploration by Random Connection strategy (ERC) are concurrently proposed
within the SOG to help the model rethink its initial prediction. Extensive
ablation studies and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches on prevalent
visual grounding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed

experiences. However, as an important part of the immersive experiences, the
defocus effects have not been fully explored within NeRF. Some recent
NeRF-based methods generate 3D defocus effects in a post-process fashion by
utilizing multiplane technology. Still, they are either time-consuming or
memory-consuming. This paper proposes a novel thin-lens-imaging-based NeRF
framework that can directly render various 3D defocus effects, dubbed NeRFocus.
Unlike the pinhole, the thin lens refracts rays of a scene point, so its
imaging on the sensor plane is scattered as a circle of confusion (CoC). A
direct solution sampling enough rays to approximate this process is
computationally expensive. Instead, we propose to inverse the thin lens imaging
to explicitly model the beam path for each point on the sensor plane and
generalize this paradigm to the beam path of each pixel, then use the
frustum-based volume rendering to render each pixel's beam path. We further
design an efficient probabilistic training (p-training) strategy to simplify
the training process vastly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
NeRFocus can achieve various 3D defocus effects with adjustable camera pose,
focus distance, and aperture size. Existing NeRF can be regarded as our special
case by setting aperture size as zero to render large depth-of-field images.
Despite such merits, NeRFocus does not sacrifice NeRF's original performance
(e.g., training and inference time, parameter consumption, rendering quality),
which implies its great potential for broader application and further
improvement. Code and video are available at

controllers for quadrupedal robots. Conventionally, an RL design for locomotion
follows a position-based paradigm, wherein an RL policy outputs target joint
positions at a low frequency that are then tracked by a high-frequency
proportional-derivative (PD) controller to produce joint torques. In contrast,
for the model-based control of quadrupedal locomotion, there has been a
paradigm shift from position-based control to torque-based control. In light of
the recent advances in model-based control, we explore an alternative to the
position-based RL paradigm, by introducing a torque-based RL framework, where
an RL policy directly predicts joint torques at a high frequency, thus
circumventing the use of a PD controller. The proposed learning torque control
framework is validated with extensive experiments, in which a quadruped is
capable of traversing various terrain and resisting external disturbances while
following user-specified commands. Furthermore, compared to learning position
control, learning torque control demonstrates the potential to achieve a higher
reward and is more robust to significant external disturbances. To our
knowledge, this is the first sim-to-real attempt for end-to-end learning torque
control of quadrupedal locomotion.

contain more geometric information than the 2D counterpart. However, it is also
more challenging due to the higher complexity and wider variety of inter-object
relations contained in point clouds. Existing methods only treat such relations
as by-products of object feature learning in graphs without specifically
encoding them, which leads to sub-optimal results. In this paper, aiming at
improving 3D dense captioning via capturing and utilizing the complex relations
in the 3D scene, we propose MORE, a Multi-Order RElation mining model, to
support generating more descriptive and comprehensive captions. Technically,
our MORE encodes object relations in a progressive manner since complex
relations can be deduced from a limited number of basic ones. We first devise a
novel Spatial Layout Graph Convolution (SLGC), which semantically encodes
several first-order relations as edges of a graph constructed over 3D object
proposals. Next, from the resulting graph, we further extract multiple triplets
which encapsulate basic first-order relations as the basic unit, and construct
several Object-centric Triplet Attention Graphs (OTAG) to infer multi-order
relations for every target object. The updated node features from OTAG are
aggregated and fed into the caption decoder to provide abundant relational
cues, so that captions including diverse relations with context objects can be
generated. Extensive experiments on the Scan2Cap dataset prove the
effectiveness of our proposed MORE and its components, and we also outperform
the current state-of-the-art method. Our code is available at

self-generated signaling gradients and cell division, which has been proposed
in an earlier study. The model consists in a system of two coupled parabolic
diffusion-advection-reaction equations. Because of a discontinuous advection
term, the Cauchy problem should be handled with care. We first establish
existence and uniqueness locally in time through the reduction of the problem
to the well-posedness of an ODE, under a monotonicity condition on the
signaling gradient. Then, we carry out an asymptotic analysis of the system.
All positive and bounded traveling waves of the system are computed and an
explicit formula for the minimal wave speed is deduced. An analysis on the
inside dynamics of the wave establishes a dichotomy between pushed and pulled
waves depending on the strength of the advection. We identified the minimal
wave speed as the biologically relevant speed, in a weak sense, that is, the
solution propagates slower, respectively faster, than the minimal wave speed,
up to time extraction. Finally, we extend the study to a hyperbolic
two-velocity model with persistence.

Our previous work proposed a variant of the Multiple Travelling Salesmen

salesmen's selfishness when they minimise their individual route length. If, on
the contrary, they are assumed to be benevolent, we add subscript ""b"" and thus
the term MTSPb to refer to the traditional MTSP in which the salesmen minimise

out the allocation of cities in the MTSPb . The first experiment shows that the
relative efficiency (ranking) of the organisations differs between MTSPb and
MTSPs . Since reactivity fosters decentralisation, the second experiment

gradient induced bulk magnetic asymmetry (BMA) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC)
are systematically examined. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy,
both the sign and amplitude of DMI in films with controllable direction and
strength of BMA, in the presence and absence of SOC are experimentally studied.
In particular, we show that a sizable amplitude of DMI (0.15 mJ/m^2) can be
realized in CoPt or FePt films with BMA and strong SOC, whereas negligible DMI
strengths are observed in other thick films with BMA but without significant
SOC. The pivotal roles of BMA and SOC are further examined based on the

inference attack for practical split learning. The adversary (either clients or
servers) can accurately retrieve the private labels by collecting the exchanged
gradients and smashed data.We mathematically analyse potential label leakages
in split learning and propose the cosine and Euclidean similarity measurements
for clustering attack. Experimental results validate that the proposed approach
is scalable and robust under different settings (e.g., cut layer positions,
epochs, and batch sizes) for practical split learning.The adversary can still
achieve accurate predictions, even when differential privacy and gradient
compression are adopted for label protections.

ratio of the intervalley scattering time to the intravalley scattering time,
estimated using the WL formula for bilayer graphene, tended to decrease as the

valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall insulator (VQAHI) to half-valley-metal

can be induced. These topological phase transitions are connected with
sign-reversible Berry curvature and band inversion between

piezoelectric polarization of $\mathrm{OsBr_2}$ is confined along the in-plane
armchair direction, and only one $d_{11}$ is independent. For a given material,
the correlation strength should be fixed, and $\mathrm{OsBr_2}$ may be a
piezoelectric VQAHI (PVQAHI), piezoelectric HVM (PHVM) or piezoelectric FVI
(PFVI). The valley polarization can be flipped by reversing the magnetization
of Os atoms, and the ferrovalley (FV) and nontrivial topological properties
will be suppressed by manipulating out-of-plane magnetization to in-plane one.
In considered reasonable $U$ range, the estimated Curie temperatures all are
higher than room temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive
understanding on possible electronic states of $\mathrm{OsBr_2}$, and confirm
that strong SOC combined with electronic correlation can induce multiple

continuous quantum criticality between the two symmetry broken phases can be
described within the framework of Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) model. Using the
first-order $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions, we study the
critical structure and emergent symmetry of the chiral GNY model with $N_f$
flavors of four-component Dirac fermions coupled strongly to an $O(N)$ scalar
field under a small $O(N)$-symmetry breaking perturbation. After determining
the stable fixed point, we calculate the inverse correlation length exponent
and the anomalous dimensions (bosonic and fermionic) for general $N$ and $N_f$.
Further, we discuss the emergent-symmetry and the emergent supersymmetric
critical point for $N\geq4$ on the basis of $O(N)$-GNY model. It turns out that
the chiral emergent-$O(N)$ universality class is physically meaningful if and
only if $N<2N_f+4$. On this premise, the small $O(N)$-symmetry breaking
perturbation is always irrelevant in the chiral emergent-$O(N)$ universality
class. Our studies show that the emergent symmetry in Dirac systems has an

the emergent-$O(4)$ and $O(5)$ symmetries are possible to be found in the

the ejection of large-scale magnetic clouds (MCs) in interplanetary space that

severity of geomagnetic perturbations depends on the direction and strength of
the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), as well as the speed and duration of
passage of the storm. The coupling between the heliospheric environment and
Earth's magnetosphere is the strongest when the IMF direction is persistently

to build upon and integrate diverse techniques towards development of a
comprehensive magnetic cloud prediction (MCP) model that can forecast the
magnetic field vectors, Earth-impact time, speed and duration of passage of

duration of the storm without recourse to computationally intensive,
time-dependent dynamical equations. Our methodology is validated by comparing
the MCP model output with observations of ten MCs at 1 AU. In our sample, we
find that eight MCs show a root mean square deviation of less than 0.1 between
predicted and observed magnetic profiles and the passage duration of seven MCs
fall within the predicted range. Based on the success of this approach, we
conclude that predicting the near-Earth properties of MCs based on analysis and

cyberattacks keeps increasing as Internet usage continues to grow. An intrusion
detection system (IDS) is an alarm system that helps to detect cyberattacks. As
new types of cyberattacks continue to emerge, researchers focus on developing
machine learning (ML) based IDS to detect zero-day attacks. Researchers usually
remove some or all attack samples from the training dataset and only include
them in the testing dataset when evaluating the performance of an IDS on
detecting zero-day attacks. Although this method may show the ability of an IDs
to detect unknown attacks; however, it does not reflect the long-term
performance of the IDS as it only shows the changes in the type of attacks. In
this paper, we focus on evaluating the long-term performance of ML based IDS.
To achieve this goal, we propose evaluating the ML-based IDS using a dataset
that is created later than the training dataset. The proposed method can better
assess the long-term performance of an ML-based IDS, as the testing dataset
reflects the changes in the type of attack and the changes in network
infrastructure over time. We have implemented six of the most popular ML models
that are used for IDS, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF),
support vector machine (SVM), na\""ive Bayes (NB), artificial neural network
(ANN) and deep neural network (DNN). Our experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 and
the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets show that SVM and ANN are most resistant to
overfitting. Besides that, our experiment results also show that DT and RF
suffer the most from overfitting, although they perform well on the training
dataset. On the other hand, our experiments using the LUFlow dataset have shown
that all models can perform well when the difference between the training and

of network resources commonly existing in multi-hop transmission networks, the
paper proposes the idea and the corresponding supporting theory, i.e. theory of
network wave, by constructing volatility information transmission mechanism
between the sending nodes and their corresponding receiving nodes of a pair of
paths (composed of two primary paths), so as to improve the orderliness of the
utilization of network resources. It is proved that the maximum asymptotic
throughput of a primary path depends on its intrinsic period, which in itself
is equal to the intrinsic interference intensity of a primary path. Based on
the proposed theory of network wave, an algorithm for the transmission of
information blocks based on the intrinsic period of a primary path is proposed,
which can maximize the asymptotic throughput of a primary path. In the cases of
traversals with equal opportunities, an algorithm for the cooperative
volatility transmission of information blocks in a pair of paths based on the
set of maximum supporting elements is proposed. It is proved that the algorithm
can maximize the asymptotic joint throughput of a pair of paths. The research
results of the paper lay an ideological and theoretical foundation for further
exploring more general methods that can improve the orderly utilization of

language sentence in an untrimmed video, has drawn widespread attention over
the past few years. However, recent studies have found that current benchmark
datasets may have obvious moment annotation biases, enabling several simple
baselines even without training to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we
take a closer look at existing evaluation protocols, and find both the
prevailing dataset and evaluation metrics are the devils that lead to
untrustworthy benchmarking. Therefore, we propose to re-organize the two
widely-used datasets, making the ground-truth moment distributions different in
the training and test splits, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) test. Meanwhile,
we introduce a new evaluation metric ""dR@n,IoU@m"" that discounts the basic
recall scores to alleviate the inflating evaluation caused by biased datasets.
New benchmarking results indicate that our proposed evaluation protocols can
better monitor the research progress. Furthermore, we propose a novel
causality-based Multi-branch Deconfounding Debiasing (MDD) framework for
unbiased moment prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-branch deconfounder
to eliminate the effects caused by multiple confounders with causal
intervention. In order to help the model better align the semantics between
sentence queries and video moments, we enhance the representations during
feature encoding. Specifically, for textual information, the query is parsed
into several verb-centered phrases to obtain a more fine-grained textual
feature. For visual information, the positional information has been decomposed
from moment features to enhance representations of moments with diverse
locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach can
achieve competitive results among existing SOTA approaches and outperform the
base model with great gains.

alternative representation of CPWL functions that relies on local hat basis

by a triangulation and its values at the grid points. We give the necessary and
sufficient condition on the triangulation (in any number of dimensions) for the
hat functions to form a Riesz basis, which ensures that the link between the

control points placed on a uniform grid. In particular, we choose hat basis

payment phase. This novel charging paradigm, which connects the Smart Grid to
external networks (e.g., EVs and CSs), has not been thoroughly examined yet.
Therefore, it may lead to dangerous vulnerability surfaces and new research

  In this paper, we present EVExchange, the first attack to steal energy during
a charging session in a V2G communication: i.e., charging the attacker's car
while letting the victim pay for it. Furthermore, if reverse charging flow is
enabled, the attacker can even sell the energy available on the victim's car!
Thus, getting the economic profit of this selling, and leaving the victim with

sharp. In light of the hardness of the problem, it is not surprising that such

by combining our advanced simulation platform with real quantum computers, we
provided an analysis of how the noise, inherent to quantum computers, affects
the results. The centers of our study are the hardware efficient and quantum
unitary coupled cluster ansatze (qUCC). First, we find that the hardware
efficient ansatz has the potential to outperform mean-field methods for extreme
deformations of benzene. However, key problems remain at equilibrium,
preventing real chemical application. Moreover, the hardware efficient ansatz
yields results that strongly depend on the initial guess of parameters - both
in the noisy and noiseless cases - and optimization issues have a higher impact
on their convergence than noise. This is confirmed by comparison with real
quantum computing experiments. On the other hand, the qUCC ansatz alternative
exhibits deeper circuits. Therefore, noise effects increase and are so extreme
that the method never outperform mean-field theories. Our dual simulator/8-16
qubits QPU computations of qUCC appears to be a lot more sensitive to hardware
noise than shot noise, which give further indications about where the
noise-reduction efforts should be directed towards. Finally, the study shows
that qUCC method better captures the physics of the system as the qUCC method
can be utilized together with the Huckel approximation. We discussed how going

supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) can be encoded in the timing residuals
of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). For each pulsar, the residuals actually contain
an Earth term and a pulsar term, but usually only the Earth term is considered
as signal and the pulsar term is dropped, which leads to parameter-estimation
biases (PEBs) for the SMBBHs, and currently there are no convenient evaluations
of the PEBs. In this article, we formulate the PEBs for a SMBBH with an
eccentric orbit. In our analyses, the unknown phases of pulsar terms are
treated as random variables obeying the uniform distribution $U[0,2\pi)$, due
to the fact that pulsar distances are generally poorly measured. Our analytical
results are in accordance with the numerical work by Zhu et. al. (2016) at
$1.5\sigma$ level, implying that our formulae are effective in estimating
magnitudes of the PEBs. Additionally, we find that for two parameters -- Earth
term phase $\varphi^E$ and orbital eccentricity $e$, their biases $\Delta
\varphi^E$ and $\Delta e/e$ monotonically decrease as $e$ increases, which
partly confirms a hypothesis in our previous work Chen & Zhang (2018).
Furthermore, we also calculate the PEBs caused by the recently observed
common-spectrum process (CSP), finding that if the strain amplitude of the

  Regret-Matching Learning-Based Approach","10 pages, 12 figures, and 1 table",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vehicular edge computing has recently been proposed to support
computation-intensive applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
such as self-driving cars and augmented reality. Despite progress in this area,
significant challenges remain to efficiently allocate limited computation
resources to a range of time-critical ITS tasks. To this end, the current paper
develops a new task assignment scheme for vehicles in a highway. Because of the
high speed of vehicles and the limited communication range of road side units
(RSUs), the computation tasks of participating vehicles are to be dynamically
migrated across multiple servers. We formulate a binary nonlinear programming
(BNLP) problem of assigning computation tasks from vehicles to RSUs and a
macrocell base station. To deal with the potentially large size of the
formulated optimization problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent
regret-matching learning algorithm. Based on the regret minimization principle,
the proposed algorithm employs a forgetting method that allows the learning
process to quickly adapt to and effectively handle the high mobility feature of
vehicle networks. We theoretically prove that it converges to the correlated
equilibrium solutions of the considered BNLP problem. Simulation results with
practical parameter settings show that the proposed algorithm offers the lowest
total delay and cost of processing tasks, as well as utility fairness among
agents. Importantly, our algorithm converges much faster than existing methods
as the problem size grows, demonstrating its clear advantage in large-scale
vehicular networks.

that allow for reproducing artefacts and results over decades (a standard

exponentially with the agent number. Such a curse of dimensionality results in
poor scalability and low sample efficiency, inhibiting MARL for decades. To
break this curse, we propose a unified agent permutation framework that
exploits the permutation invariance (PI) and permutation equivariance (PE)
inductive biases to reduce the multiagent state space. Our insight is that
permuting the order of entities in the factored multiagent state space does not
change the information. Specifically, we propose two novel implementations: a
Dynamic Permutation Network (DPN) and a Hyper Policy Network (HPN). The core
idea is to build separate entity-wise PI input and PE output network modules to
connect the entity-factored state space and action space in an end-to-end way.
DPN achieves such connections by two separate module selection networks, which
consistently assign the same input module to the same input entity (guarantee
PI) and assign the same output module to the same entity-related output
(guarantee PE). To enhance the representation capability, HPN replaces the
module selection networks of DPN with hypernetworks to directly generate the
corresponding module weights. Extensive experiments in SMAC, Google Research
Football and MPE validate that the proposed methods significantly boost the
performance and the learning efficiency of existing MARL algorithms.
Remarkably, in SMAC, we achieve 100% win rates in almost all hard and
super-hard scenarios (never achieved before).

actions are extended to words in the natural way. A word is then {\em

paper, we ask for the existence of synchronizing words, and their minimal

connected and has no positive cycles, then either every and-or-net on $G$ has a
synchronizing word of length at most $10(\sqrt{5}+1)^n$, much smaller than the
bound $(2^n-1)^2$ given by the well known \v{C}ern\'y's conjecture, or $G$ is a
cycle and no and-or-net on $G$ has a synchronizing word. This contrasts with

We also determine the order of magnitude for large classes of (cyclically)

studied with Insight-HXMT. Here we fit simultaneously the time-averaged energy

Comptonization model when the source was in the intermediate state. We show,
for the first time, that the time-dependent Comptonization model can
successfully explain the X-ray data up to 100 keV. We find that in the

of a machine learning inference task. We present a design-technology tradeoff
analysis to implement such inference tasks on the processing elements (PEs) of
a Non- Volatile Memory (NVM)-based neuromorphic hardware. Through detailed
circuit-level simulations at scaled process technology nodes, we show the
negative impact of technology scaling on the information-processing latency,
which impacts the quality-of-service (QoS) of an embedded ML system. At a finer
granularity, the latency inside a PE depends on 1) the delay introduced by
parasitic components on its current paths, and 2) the varying delay to sense
different resistance states of its NVM cells. Based on these two observations,
we make the following three contributions. First, on the technology front, we
propose an optimization scheme where the NVM resistance state that takes the
longest time to sense is set on current paths having the least delay, and vice
versa, reducing the average PE latency, which improves the QoS. Second, on the
architecture front, we introduce isolation transistors within each PE to
partition it into regions that can be individually power-gated, reducing both
latency and energy. Finally, on the system-software front, we propose a
mechanism to leverage the proposed technological and architectural enhancements
when implementing a machine-learning inference task on neuromorphic PEs of the
hardware. Evaluations with a recent neuromorphic hardware architecture show
that our proposed design-technology co-optimization approach improves both
performance and energy efficiency of machine-learning inference tasks without
incurring high cost-per-bit.

the mapping of any dynamical system with irreducible first-class constraints in
the phase space into another dynamical system with first-class constraints. It
is shown that such a deformation problem can be efficiently explored in the
framework of the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism. The basic objects
of this formalism are the BRST-BFV charge and a generalized Hamiltonian that
satisfy the defining equations in the extended phase space in terms of

in terms of a (super)canonical transformation with a special generating
function which is explicitly established. It is proved that this generating
function is determined by a single arbitrary function which depends only on
coordinates of initial dynamical system. In principle, such a function may be
non-local, but the deformed theory may have a local sector. To illustrate the
developed approach, we have constructed a non-local deformation of the Abelian
gauge theory into a non-local non-Abelian gauge theory whose local sector
coincides with the standard Yang-Mills theory.

Though most ($\sim 50-100\,\%$) of the gas mass in our simulations is ionized,

from observational samples of more massive, metal-rich galaxies at $z \lesssim

factor of $\alpha_{\rm [CII]} \simeq 18\,{\rm M_{\rm \odot}/L_{\rm \odot}}$.
This is lower than the average value of $\simeq 30\,{\rm M_{\rm \odot}/L_{\rm

metallicities in our simulations. Thus, a lower, luminosity-dependent,
conversion factor must be applied when inferring molecular gas masses from
[C${\rm \scriptsize II}$] observations of low-mass galaxies. For our
simulations, [C${\rm \scriptsize II}$] is a better tracer of the molecular gas
than CO $J=1-0$, especially at the lowest metallicities, where much of the gas
is 'CO-dark'. We find that $L_{\rm [CII]}$ is more tightly correlated with
$M_{\rm mol}$ than with star-formation rate (${\rm SFR}$), and both the $\log
L_{\rm [CII]}-\log M_{\rm mol}$ and $\log L_{\rm [CII]}-\log {\rm SFR}$

using pre-neutron emission fission product yields (FPYs) and neutron
multiplicity. A semi-empirical model is used to calculate the pre-neutron FPY,
first. Then the neutron multiplicity for each fission fragment mass is used to
convert the pre-neutron FPY to the post-neutron FPY. In doing so, assumptions
are made for the probability for a pre-emission fission fragment with a mass

resulting post-neutron FPYs are compared with the data available. The systems
where the experimental data of not only the pre- and post-neutron FPY but also

Accepted in PRC",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.105.034341",,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sr isotopes are located in the mass region $A\approx 100$, where a very quick
onset of nuclear deformation exists, being other notable examples of this area
Yb, Zr, and Nb nuclei. The presence of the proton subshell closure $Z=40$
allows the existence of particle-hole excitations that produces low-lying
intruder bands.
  Purpose: The goal of this work is the study of the nuclear structure of the
even-even $^{92-102}$Sr isotopes through the accurate description of excitation
energies, $B(E2)$ transition rates, nuclear radii and two-neutron separation
energies.
  Method: The interacting boson model with configuration mixing will be the
framework to calculate all the observables of the Sr isotopes. Only two types
of configurations will be considered, namely, 0particle-0hole and
2particle-2hole excitations. The parameters of the model are determined using a
least-squares procedure for the excitation energies and the $B(E2)$ transition
rates.
  Results: For the whole chain of isotopes, the value of excitation energies,
$B(E2)$'s, two-neutron separation energies, nuclear radii, and isotope shifts
have been obtained, with a good agreement between theory and experiment. Also,
a detailed analysis of the wave functions have been performed and, finally, the
mean-field energy surfaces and the value of the nuclear deformation, $\beta$,
have been obtained.
  Conclusions: The presence of low-lying intruder states in even-even Sr
isotopes have been confirmed and its connection with the onset of deformation
has been clarified. Lightest Sr isotopes present a spherical structure while
the heaviest ones are clearly deformed. The rapid onset of deformation at
neutron number $60$ is due to the crossing of the regular and intruder
configurations and, moreover, both families of states present an increase of
deformation with the neutron number.

non-generative model to address these problems correspondingly in two modules:
(1) Task-correlated feature disentanglement, to exclude the task-correlated
features from task-independent ones by adversarial learning of domain adaption
towards reasonable synthesis; (2) Controllable pseudo sample synthesis, to
synthesize edge-pseudo and center-pseudo samples with certain characteristics
towards more diversity generated and intuitive transfer. In addation, to
describe the new scene that is the limit seen class samples in the training
process, we further formulate a new ZSL task named the 'Few-shot Seen class and
Zero-shot Unseen class learning' (FSZU). Extensive experiments on four
benchmarks verify that the proposed method is competitive in the GZSL and the
FSZU tasks.

discretization of PDEs. The scheme has a single hidden layer with appropriately
randomly parametrized Gaussian kernels and a linear output layer, while the
internal weights are fixed to ones. The unknown weights between the hidden and

pseudoinverse for low to medium, and sparse QR decomposition with
regularization for medium to large scale systems. To deal with stiffness and
sharp gradients, we propose a variable step size scheme for adjusting the
interval of integration and address a continuation method for providing good
initial guesses for the Newton iterations. Based on previous works on random

the canonical form and index-1 DAEs in the semiexplicit form. The optimal
bounds of the uniform distribution are parsimoniously chosen based on the
bias-variance trade-off. The performance of the scheme is assessed through
seven benchmark problems: four index-1 DAEs, the Robertson model, a model of
five DAEs describing the motion of a bead, a model of six DAEs describing a

stiff problems, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky, the Allen-Cahn PDE and the

anti-spoofing (FAS) has drawn growing attention. Most existing methods
implement domain generalization (DG) on the complete representations. However,
different image statistics may have unique properties for the FAS tasks. In
this work, we separate the complete representation into content and style ones.
A novel Shuffled Style Assembly Network (SSAN) is proposed to extract and
reassemble different content and style features for a stylized feature space.
Then, to obtain a generalized representation, a contrastive learning strategy
is developed to emphasize liveness-related style information while suppress the
domain-specific one. Finally, the representations of the correct assemblies are
used to distinguish between living and spoofing during the inferring. On the
other hand, despite the decent performance, there still exists a gap between
academia and industry, due to the difference in data quantity and distribution.
Thus, a new large-scale benchmark for FAS is built up to further evaluate the
performance of algorithms in reality. Both qualitative and quantitative results
on existing and proposed benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
methods. The codes will be available at https://github.com/wangzhuo2019/SSAN.

of apparent image-based contents, because they are not capable of exploring
implicit information beyond images. Hence, these schemes could not capture
consistent dependencies from holistic representation, impairing the generation
of reasonable and fluent story. To address these problems, a novel
knowledge-enriched attention network with group-wise semantic model is
proposed. Three main novel components are designed and supported by substantial
experiments to reveal practical advantages. First, a knowledge-enriched
attention network is designed to extract implicit concepts from external
knowledge system, and these concepts are followed by a cascade cross-modal
attention mechanism to characterize imaginative and concrete representations.
Second, a group-wise semantic module with second-order pooling is developed to
explore the globally consistent guidance. Third, a unified one-stage story
generation model with encoder-decoder structure is proposed to simultaneously
train and infer the knowledge-enriched attention network, group-wise semantic

network nonlocality when two observers initially share close to a maximally
entangled states. We report that by employing unsharp measurements performed by
one of the observers, six pairs can sequentially demonstrate the violation of
bilocal correlations while a maximum of two pairs of observers can exhibit
bi-nonlocality when both the observers perform unsharp measurements. We also
find the critical noise involved in unsharp measurements in each round to

We also establish a connection between entanglement content of the shared

of rounds showing violation of bilocal correlations. By reducing entanglement
content in the elements of the joint measurement by the third party, we observe

near optimal reflection coefficients with adequately high probability can be
obtained. In addition, we extend the original one-bit phase shift at the IRS to
the common case with high-resolution phase shift to enhance the effectiveness
of the algorithms. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can
obtain a near optimal solution with lower computational complexity.

current understanding of how these intriguing objects formed leaves much to be
desired. Many trends observed in systems containing barium stars cannot be
satisfactorily explained by classical binary evolution models, naturally
raising the question of whether triples and other higher-order multiples can
give rise to such exotic objects. In this paper, we study the possibility that
a Roche Lobe overflow from a tertiary in a hierarchical triple system can
potentially lead to surface barium enrichment within the inner binary, while at
the same time causing the inner binary to merge, thereby producing a barium
star. This possibility has the potential to form a large proportion of Barium
stars, as Roche Lobe overflow from a tertiary is typically much more stable for
close orbits than that from a binary companion. Various formation channels and
mechanisms by which this can be achieved are considered, and constraints on
relative formation rates are placed on each scenario. We conclude that a
significant, if not dominant, proportion of barium stars are formed from
hierarchical triple systems, and that further studies are required in this area
before a complete understanding of Barium star populations can be achieved.

years. A discussion of climate change without referring to scientific results
is not imaginable. This is especially the case for policies since action on the
macro scale is required to avoid costly consequences for society. In this
study, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy
are connected. In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was
released including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents.
The use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be
reflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we
suspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in
Overton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on
policy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents
around major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results point
out that IGOs and think tanks -- with a focus on climate change -- have
published more climate change policy documents than expected. We found that
climate change papers that are cited in climate change policy documents
received significantly more citations on average than climate change papers
that are not cited in these documents. Both areas of society (science and
policy) focus on similar climate change research fields: biology, earth
sciences, engineering, and disease sciences. Based on these and other empirical
results in this study, we propose a simple model of policy impact considering a
chain of different document types: the chain starts with scientific assessment
reports (systematic reviews) that lead via science communication documents
(policy briefs, policy reports or plain language summaries) and government
reports to legislative documents.

energy efficient, relatively silent and safe. To address the blimp navigation
and control task, in previous work we developed a hardware and
software-in-the-loop framework and a PID-based controller for large blimps in
the presence of wind disturbance. However, blimps have a deformable structure
and their dynamics are inherently non-linear and time-delayed, making PID
controllers difficult to tune. Thus, often resulting in large tracking errors.
Moreover, the buoyancy of a blimp is constantly changing due to variations in
ambient temperature and pressure. To address these issues, in this paper we
present a learning-based framework based on deep residual reinforcement
learning (DRRL), for the blimp control task. Within this framework, we first
employ a PID controller to provide baseline performance. Subsequently, the DRRL
agent learns to modify the PID decisions by interaction with the environment.
We demonstrate in simulation that DRRL agent consistently improves the PID
performance. Through rigorous simulation experiments, we show that the agent is
robust to changes in wind speed and buoyancy. In real-world experiments, we
demonstrate that the agent, trained only in simulation, is sufficiently robust
to control an actual blimp in windy conditions. We openly provide the source

one in the region of PT symmetry, while it decreases with {\eta} in the

behavior at the exceptional point, and the same is true in the case of the
biorthogonal basis, which indicates that the concurrence can characterize the
phase transition in this non-Hermitian system. The interesting thing is that
{\eta} weakens the thermal entanglement when the system is isotropic and
enhances the entanglement when the system becomes the Ising model. For the
one-dimensional spin chain, the magnetization and entanglement are further
studied by using the two-spin cluster mean-field approximation. The results
show that their variations have opposite trends with the magnetic fields.

where an axion may convert into a cavity photon, leading to a feeble excess in
the output power of the cavity. Recent work [Nature 590, 238 (2021)] has
demonstrated that injecting squeezed vacuum into the cavity can substantially
accelerate the axion search. Here, we go beyond and provide a theoretical
framework to leverage the benefits of quantum squeezing in a network setting

signals among the cavities can be combined coherently to boost the axion
search. Furthermore, injecting multipartite entanglement across the cavities --
generated by splitting a squeezed vacuum -- enables a global noise reduction.
We explore the performance advantage of such a local, entangled sensor-network,
which enjoys both coherence between the axion signals and entanglement between
the sensors. Our analyses are pertinent to next-generation DM-axion searches

the state of the voter and biased voters whose confidence is biased towards a
common fixed preferred state. We study the problem analytically on the complete
graph using mean field theory and on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network

interactions topology is independent of the type of voters. We find that for
the case of a random initial setup, and for sufficiently large number of voters
$N$, the time to consensus increases proportionally to $\log(N)/\gamma v$, with
$\gamma$ the fraction of biased voters and $v$ the parameter quantifying the
bias of the voters ($v=0$ no bias). We verify our analytical results through
numerical simulations. We study this model on a biased-dependent topology of
the network of interactions and examine two distinct, global average-degree
preserving strategies (model I and model II) to obtain such biased-dependent
random topologies starting from the biased-independent random topology case as
the initial setup. Keeping all other parameters constant, in model I,
$\mu_{BU}$, the average number of links among biased (B) and unbiased (U)
voters is varied at the expense of $\mu_{UU}$ and $\mu_{BB}$, i.e. the average
number of links among only unbiased and biased voters respectively. In model
II, $\mu_{BU}$ is kept constant, while $\mu_{BB}$ is varied at the expense of
$\mu_{UU}$. We find that if the agents follow the strategy described by model

and Einstein gravity. A consequence of gauging this symmetry is that their
underlying 4D geometry is non-metric ($\nabla_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}\not=0$).
Examples of such theories are Weyl's {\it original} quadratic gravity theory
and its Palatini version. These theories have spontaneous breaking of the
gauged scale symmetry to Einstein gravity. All mass scales have a geometric
origin: the Planck scale ($M_p$), cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) and the
mass of the Weyl gauge boson ($\omega_\mu$) of scale symmetry are proportional
to a scalar field vev that has an origin in the (geometric) $\tilde R^2$ term
in the action. With $\omega_\mu$ of non-metric geometry origin, the SM Higgs
field also has a similar origin, generated by Weyl boson fusion in the early
Universe. This appears as a microscopic realisation of ""matter creation from
geometry"" discussed in the thermodynamics of open systems applied to cosmology.
Unlike in local scale invariant theories (no $\omega_\mu$ present) with an
underlying pseudo-Riemannian geometry, in our case: 1) there are no ghosts and
no additional fields beyond the SM and underlying Weyl or Palatini geometry, 2)
the cosmological constant is positive and is small because gravity is weak, 3)
the Weyl or Palatini connection shares the Weyl (gauge) symmetry of the action,
and: 4) there exists a non-trivial, conserved Weyl current of this symmetry. An
intuitive picture of non-metricity and its relation to mass generation is also
provided from a solid state physics perspective where it is common and is
associated with point defects (metric anomalies) of the crystalline structure.

Fluency shaping is a therapy approach where PWSs learn to modify their speech

evaluated highly, but relapse rates are high. To be able to monitor speech

conductivity with wavevector, $k_{\rho}$, is appreciable for $k_{\rho}$s
greater than $100k_0$, where $k_0$ is the magnitude of the wavevector in the

the spectral radiative conductance between two graphene sheets except for
around the surface-plasmon-polariton frequency of graphene and at separation
gaps smaller than 20 nm where there is a non-negligible contribution from modes
with $k_{\rho}>100k_0$ to the radiative conductance. The Drude formula proves
to be inaccurate for modeling the electrical conductivity and radiative

  Pair Selection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Person Re-identification (Re-ID) has attracted great attention due to its
promising real-world applications. However, in practice, it is always costly to
annotate the training data to train a Re-ID model, and it still remains
challenging to reduce the annotation cost while maintaining the performance for
the Re-ID task. To solve this problem, we propose the Annotation Efficient
Person Re-Identification method to select image pairs from an alternative pair
set according to the fallibility and diversity of pairs, and train the Re-ID
model based on the annotation. Specifically, we design an annotation and
training framework to firstly reduce the size of the alternative pair set by
clustering all images considering the locality of features, secondly select
images pairs from intra-/inter-cluster samples for human to annotate, thirdly
re-assign clusters according to the annotation, and finally train the model
with the re-assigned clusters. During the pair selection, we seek for valuable
pairs according to pairs' fallibility and diversity, which includes an
intra-cluster criterion to construct image pairs with the most chaotic samples
and the representative samples within clusters, an inter-cluster criterion to
construct image pairs between clusters based on the second-order Wasserstein
distance, and a diversity criterion for clusterbased pair selection. Combining
all criteria above, a greedy strategy is developed to solve the pair selection
problem. Finally, the above
clustering-selecting-annotating-reassigning-training procedure will be repeated
until the annotation budget is reached. Extensive experiments on three widely
adopted Re-ID datasets show that we can greatly reduce the annotation cost
while achieving better performance compared with state-of-the-art works.

an ultra-relativistic and strongly magnetized electron-positron pair plasma
streaming along the open magnetic field lines of the pulsar. Traditional
coherent radio emission models have relied on instabilities in this pair
plasma. Recently alternative models have been suggested. These models appeal to
direct coupling of the external electromagnetic field to the superluminal
O-mode ($lt_2$ mode) during the time-dependent pair cascade process at the
polar gap. The objective of this work is to provide generic constraints on
plasma models based on $lt_2$ mode using realistic pulsar parameters. We find
that the very short timescale associated with pair cascades does not allow
$lt_{2}$ mode to be excited at radio frequencies and the impulsive energy
transfer can only increase the kinetic spread (""temperature"") of the pair
plasma particles. Moreover, under homogeneous plasma conditions, plasma waves
on both branches of O-mode (i.e. superluminal $lt_2$ and subluminal $lt_1$)
cannot escape the plasma. In the strongly magnetized pair plasma, only the
extraordinary mode ($t$ mode) can escape freely. We show that any generic
fictitious mechanisms does not result in the wave electric field of $t$ mode to
have predominant orientation either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic
field plane as observed. Such fictitious mechanisms will inevitably lead to
depolarization of signals and cannot account for the highly polarized single
pulses observed in pulsars. We suggest coherent curvature radiation as a
promising candidate for pulsar radio emission mechanism.

convergence of the conditional mean to the response function. We prove that the

undersmooth the truth when the data are obtained on a fixed bounded subset of

we show that maximum likelihood estimation finds the ""correct"" smoothness for a

cross-validation and prove an asymptotic lower bound $\nu_0$, which however is
unlikely to be sharp. The results are based on approximation theory in Sobolev

side information associated with users or items (e.g., user reviews and item

recommendation performance. Studies from psychology show that users have
individual differences in the utilization of various modalities for organizing
information. Therefore, for a certain factor of an item (such as appearance or
quality), the features of different modalities are of varying importance to a
user. However, existing methods ignore the fact that different modalities
contribute differently towards a user's preference on various factors of an
item. In light of this, in this paper, we propose a novel Disentangled
Multimodal Representation Learning (DMRL) recommendation model, which can
capture users' attention to different modalities on each factor in user
preference modeling. In particular, we employ a disentangled representation
technique to ensure the features of different factors in each modality are
independent of each other. A multimodal attention mechanism is then designed to
capture users' modality preference for each factor. Based on the estimated
weights obtained by the attention mechanism, we make recommendations by
combining the preference scores of a user's preferences to each factor of the
target item over different modalities. Extensive evaluation on five real-world

Accordingly, demonstrably more robust audio CAPTCHAs are important to the

principle-driven audio defenses. We begin by comparing 20 recent attack papers,
classifying and measuring their suitability to serve as the basis of new

compliant interaction with an unknown environment despite the uncertainties is
achieved. Finally, a scalability demonstration is carried out to show the

perturbative method generalized from the neutral signal case. The solved
$\Delta\phi$ naturally contains the finite distance effect and takes a
quasi-power series form with a logarithmic divergence at the leading order. The
coefficients of the series contain both the gravitational and electric
contributions. Using the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m spacetime as an example, we
found that an electric repulsion (or attraction) tends to decrease (or
increase) the critical impact parameter $b_c$. If the repulsion is strong
enough, then $b_c$ can shrink to zero and the critical particle sphere $r_{0c}$
will disappear. These results are applied to the gravitational lensing of
charge signal, from which we solved the image positions, their magnifications
and time delays. It is found that in general, the electric repulsion (or

hole shadow size as well as their magnifications but increase (or decrease) the

limited by the accuracy of cluster mass calibration. In particular, optically
identified galaxy clusters are prone to selection effects that can bias the
weak lensing mass calibration. We investigate the selection bias of the stacked
cluster lensing signal associated with optically selected clusters, using
clusters identified by the redMaPPer algorithm in the Buzzard simulations as a
case study. We find that at a given cluster halo mass, the residuals of
redMaPPer richness and weak lensing signal are positively correlated. As a
result, for a given richness selection, the stacked lensing signal is biased
high compared with what we would expect from the underlying halo mass
probability distribution. The cluster lensing selection bias can thus lead to
overestimated mean cluster mass and biased cosmology results. We show that the
lensing selection bias exhibits a strong scale-dependence and is approximately
20 to 60 percent for $\Delta\Sigma$ at large scales. This selection bias
largely originates from spurious member galaxies within +/- 20 to 60 Mpc/h
along the line of sight, highlighting the importance of quantifying projection
effects associated with the broad redshift distribution of member galaxies in
photometric cluster surveys. While our results qualitatively agree with those
in the literature, accurate quantitative modelling of the selection bias is
needed to achieve the goals of cluster lensing cosmology and will require
synthetic catalogues covering a wide range of galaxy-halo connection models.

the driving functional does not lead to changes of the dissipation potential.
Such tilt-independence separates the driving functional from the dissipation
potential, guarantees a clear modelling interpretation, and gives rise to
strong notions of gradient-system convergence.
  We show that although in general many gradient systems are tilt-independent,
certain cosh-type systems are not. We also show that this is inevitable, by
studying in detail the classical example of the Kramers high-activation-energy
limit, in which a diffusion converges to a jump process and the Wasserstein
gradient system converges to a cosh-type system. We show and explain how the
tilt-independence of the pre-limit system is lost in the limit system. This
same lack of independence can be recognized in classical theories of chemical
reaction rates in the chemical-engineering literature.
  We illustrate a similar lack of tilt-independence in a discrete setting. For
a class of ""two-terminal"" fast subnetworks, we give a complete characterization
of the dependence on the tilting, which strongly resembles the classical theory
of equivalent electrical networks.

super-symmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) in $4d$. On fuzzy twistor space, the
interactions of the IKKT model are of gravitational type. The higher-spin (HS)
gauge theory emerging in this limit from the IKKT model, denoted as HS-IKKT, on
fuzzy twistor space is shown to be a higher-spin extension of $\mathcal{N}=4$
SYM, with vertices that have more than two derivatives. We obtain its
(Euclidean) spacetime action using the Penrose transform. Although this is a
gravitational theory, it shares many features with the higher-spin extensions
of Yang-Mills in $4d$ flat space obtained in arXiv:2105.12782,
arXiv:2107.04500. The tree-level amplitudes of the HS-IKKT are studied in the

by dropping some parts of the cubic- and the quartic interactions, which is
shown to reduce to a BF-type action on commutative deformed projective twistor

continuously measuring the applied force obtained from a biomechanical

Glioblastoma patients have a median survival of 12 months with optimal therapy

necrotic masses with irregular peripheral enhancement, surrounded by vasogenic
edema. The current standard of care includes surgical resection, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, which require accurate segmentation of brain tumor
subregions. For effective treatment planning, it is vital to identify the
methylation status of the promoter of Methylguanine Methyltransferase (MGMT), a
positive prognostic factor for chemotherapy. However, current methods for brain
tumor segmentation are tedious, subjective and not scalable, and current
techniques to determine the methylation status of MGMT promoter involve
surgically invasive procedures, which are expensive and time consuming. Hence
there is a pressing need to develop automated tools to segment brain tumors and
non-invasive methods to predict methylation status of MGMT promoter, to
facilitate better treatment planning and improve survival rate. I created an
integrated diagnostics solution powered by Artificial Intelligence to
automatically segment brain tumor subregions and predict MGMT promoter
methylation status, using brain MRI scans. My AI solution is proven on large

in three orthogonal directions of the left ventricle. The long acquisition time
and complex acquisition produce make it more urgent to produce synthetic
digital twins of this imaging modality. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep

is featured by a hybrid UNet and a Generative Adversarial Network with a

from temporally down-sampled magnitude CINE images (six times), our proposed
algorithm can still successfully synthesise high temporal resolution 3Dir MVM
CMR data (PSNR=42.32) with precise left ventricle segmentation (DICE=0.92).
These performance scores indicate that our proposed HDL algorithm can be
implemented in real-world digital twins for myocardial velocity mapping data

great potential for improving the efficiency of clinical studies via

non-deterministic environments, and knowing when to run each test is another
problem altogether. The modern game's complexity, scope, and player
expectations are rapidly increasing where quality control is a big portion of
the production cost and delivery risk. Reducing this risk and making production
happen is a big challenge for the industry currently. To keep production costs
realistic up-to and after release, we are focusing on preventive quality
assurance tactics alongside testing and data analysis automation. We present
SUPERNOVA (Selection of tests and Universal defect Prevention in External

an automation hub. By integrating data analysis functionality with machine and
deep learning capability, SUPERNOVA assists quality assurance testers in
finding bugs and developers in reducing defects, which improves stability
during the production cycle and keeps testing costs under control. The direct
impact of this has been observed to be a reduction in 55% or more testing hours

using the widely used computer graphics software Blender. We also record all
accompanying information related to the geometric deformation (such as 3D

margin, and providers might thus be tempted to promote items that maximize
their profit. In the short run, consumers might accept non-optimal
recommendations, but they may lose their trust in the long run. Ultimately,
this leads to the problem of designing balanced recommendation strategies,
which consider both consumer and provider value and lead to sustained business
success. This work proposes a simulation framework based on agent-based
modeling designed to help providers explore longitudinal dynamics of different
recommendation strategies. In our model, consumer agents receive
recommendations from providers, and the perceived quality of the
recommendations influences the consumers' trust over time. We design several
recommendation strategies which either give more weight on provider profit or
on consumer utility. Our simulations show that a hybrid strategy that puts more
weight on consumer utility but without ignoring profitability considerations
leads to the highest cumulative profit in the long run. This hybrid strategy
results in a profit increase of about 20 % compared to pure consumer or profit
oriented strategies. We also find that social media can reinforce the observed
phenomena. In case when consumers heavily rely on social media, the cumulative

  Insertion","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An industrial connector insertion task requires submillimeter positioning and
grasp pose compensation for a plug. Thus, highly accurate estimation of the
relative pose between a plug and socket is fundamental for achieving the task.
World models are promising technologies for visuomotor control because they
obtain appropriate state representation to jointly optimize feature extraction
and latent dynamics model. Recent studies show that the NewtonianVAE, a type of
the world model, acquires latent space equivalent to mapping from images to
physical coordinates. Proportional control can be achieved in the latent space
of NewtonianVAE. However, applying NewtonianVAE to high-accuracy industrial
tasks in physical environments is an open problem. Moreover, the existing
framework does not consider the grasp pose compensation in the obtained latent
space. In this work, we proposed tactile-sensitive NewtonianVAE and applied it
to a USB connector insertion with grasp pose variation in the physical
environments. We adopted a GelSight-type tactile sensor and estimated the
insertion position compensated by the grasp pose of the plug. Our method trains
the latent space in an end-to-end manner, and no additional engineering and
annotation are required. Simple proportional control is available in the
obtained latent space. Moreover, we showed that the original NewtonianVAE fails
in some situations, and demonstrated that domain knowledge induction improves
model accuracy. This domain knowledge can be easily obtained using robot
specification and grasp pose error measurement. We demonstrated that our
proposed method achieved a 100\% success rate and 0.3 mm positioning accuracy
in the USB connector insertion task in the physical environment. It
outperformed SOTA CNN-based two-stage goal pose regression with grasp pose
compensation using coordinate transformation.

of label-efficient methodology for medical image segmentation becomes a heated
topic. Recent progresses focus on the efficient utilization of weak annotations
together with few strongly-annotated labels so as to achieve comparable
segmentation performance in many unprofessional scenarios. However, these
approaches only concentrate on the supervision inconsistency between strongly-
and weakly-annotated instances but ignore the instance inconsistency inside the
weakly-annotated instances, which inevitably leads to performance degradation.
To address this problem, we propose a novel label-efficient hybrid-supervised
framework, which considers each weakly-annotated instance individually and
learns its weight guided by the gradient direction of the strongly-annotated
instances, so that the high-quality prior in the strongly-annotated instances
is better exploited and the weakly-annotated instances are depicted more
precisely. Specially, our designed dynamic instance indicator (DII) realizes
the above objectives, and is adapted to our dynamic co-regularization (DCR)
framework further to alleviate the erroneous accumulation from distortions of
weak annotations. Extensive experiments on two hybrid-supervised medical
segmentation datasets demonstrate that with only 10% strong labels, the
proposed framework can leverage the weak labels efficiently and achieve
competitive performance against the 100% strong-label supervised scenario.

problems. However, unlike Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), it is known that
the performance of ViT saturates quickly with depth increasing, due to the
observed attention collapse or patch uniformity. Despite a couple of empirical
solutions, a rigorous framework studying on this scalability issue remains
elusive. In this paper, we first establish a rigorous theory framework to
analyze ViT features from the Fourier spectrum domain. We show that the
self-attention mechanism inherently amounts to a low-pass filter, which
indicates when ViT scales up its depth, excessive low-pass filtering will cause
feature maps to only preserve their Direct-Current (DC) component. We then
propose two straightforward yet effective techniques to mitigate the
undesirable low-pass limitation. The first technique, termed AttnScale,
decomposes a self-attention block into low-pass and high-pass components, then
rescales and combines these two filters to produce an all-pass self-attention
matrix. The second technique, termed FeatScale, re-weights feature maps on
separate frequency bands to amplify the high-frequency signals. Both techniques
are efficient and hyperparameter-free, while effectively overcoming relevant
ViT training artifacts such as attention collapse and patch uniformity. By
seamlessly plugging in our techniques to multiple ViT variants, we demonstrate
that they consistently help ViTs benefit from deeper architectures, bringing up
to 1.1% performance gains ""for free"" (e.g., with little parameter overhead). We

improve contrast, reduce artifacts and the ability to perform material
decomposition in advanced imaging applications. The increased number or
measurements results with a higher radiation dose and it is therefore essential
to reduce either number of projections per energy or the source X-ray
intensity, but this makes tomographic reconstruction more ill-posed.
  Approach. We developed the multi-channel convolutional analysis operator
learning (MCAOL) method to exploit common spatial features within attenuation
images at different energies and we propose an optimization method which
jointly reconstructs the attenuation images at low and high energies with a
mixed norm regularization on the sparse features obtained by pre-trained
convolutional filters through the convolutional analysis operator learning
(CAOL) algorithm.
  Main results. Extensive experiments with simulated and real computed
tomography (CT) data were performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed methods and we reported increased reconstruction accuracy compared to
CAOL and iterative methods with single and joint total-variation (TV)
regularization.
  Significance. Qualitative and quantitative results on sparse-views and
low-dose DECT demonstrate that the proposed MCAOL method outperforms both CAOL
applied on each energy independently and several existing state-of-the-art
model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques, thus paving the way for
dose reduction.

applications according to the five elements of earth, water, air, fire, and
aether, proposed by the ancient Greeks in their five element theory; this
categorisation serves as a framework to discuss computer audition in relation
to different ecological aspects. Earth and water are concerned with the early

is used to monitor and obtain information about bird and insect populations.
Furthermore, acoustic measures can deliver relevant information for the
monitoring and forecasting of weather and other meteorological phenomena. The
fourth considered element is fire. Due to the burning of fossil fuels, the
resulting increase in CO$_2$ emissions and the associated rise in temperature,
fire is used as a symbol for man-made climate change and in this context
includes the monitoring of noise pollution, machines, as well as the early

counteract climate change. Aether then corresponds to the technology itself

cost of the associated spectrographs will scale with the telescope diameter.
Astrophotonics offers a unique solution to this problem in the form of
single-mode fiber-fed diffraction-limited spectrographs on a chip. These highly
miniaturized chips offer great flexibility in terms of coherent manipulation of
photons. Such photonic spectrographs are well-suited to disperse the light from
directly imaged planets (post-coronagraph, collected using a single-mode fiber)
to characterize exoplanet atmospheres. Here we present the results from a
proof-of-concept high-resolution astrophotonic spectrograph using the arrayed
waveguide gratings (AWG) architecture. This chip uses the low-loss SiN platform
(SiN core, SiO$_2$ cladding) with square waveguides (800 nm $\times$ 800 nm).
The AWG has a measured resolving power ($\lambda/\delta\lambda$) of $\sim$
12,000 and a free spectral range (FSR) of 2.8 nm. While the FSR is small, the
chip operates over a broad band (1200 $-$ 1700 nm). The peak on-chip throughput
(excluding the coupling efficiency) is $\sim$40\% (- 4 dB) and the overall
throughput (including the coupling loss) is $\sim$ 11\% (- 9.6 dB) in the TE
mode. Thanks to the high-confinement waveguide geometry, the chip is highly
miniaturized with a size of only 7.4 mm $\times$ 2 mm.
  This demonstration highlights the utility of SiN platform for astrophotonics,
particularly, the capability of commercial SiN foundries to fabricate
ultra-small, high-resolution, high-throughput AWG spectrographs on a chip
suitable for both ground- and space-based telescopes.

main dispersing element of the spectrograph is a photonic chip based on
Arrayed-Waveguide-Grating technology. The 1D spectrum produced on the focal
plane of the AWG contains overlapping spectral orders, each spanning a 10 nm
band in wavelength. These spectral orders are cross-dispersed in the
perpendicular direction using a cross-dispersion setup which consists of
collimating lenses and a prism and the 2D spectrum is thus imaged onto a
near-IR detector. Here, as a proof of concept, we use a few-mode photonic
lantern to capture the light and feed the emanating single-mode outputs to the
AWG chip for dispersion. The total size of the setup is 50$\times$30$\times$20
cm$^3$, nearly the size of a shoebox. This spectrograph will pave the way for
future miniaturized integrated photonic spectrographs on large telescopes,
particularly for building future photonic multi-object spectrographs.

Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x-y}$Sn$_y$ alloys with six different compositions up to 10 % Si
and 3 % Sn, lattice-matched to Ge or GaAs substrates. The direct transitions
occurring between 0.9 and 5.0 eV were investigated using spectroscopic
ellipsometry (SE), and the resulting data was used to obtain the dielectric
functions of the Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x-y}$Sn$_y$n layer by fitting a multi-layer
model. Values for the $E_0$, $E_1$, $\Delta_1$, $E_0'$ and $E_2$ transition

extract the locations of critical points. Structurally, the composition of the
samples was measured using energy-dispersive X-ray measurements (EDX). The
lattice constants predicted from these compositions are in good agreement with
reciprocal space maps obtained through X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results
confirm that a 1 eV direct absorption edge can be achieved using relatively low
Si and Sn fractions ($<$ 10 % and $<$ 3 % respectively), while the
higher-energy critical points show smaller shifts relative to Ge and match
results previously observed or predicted in the literature.

damage liver. Life-threatening results including liver failure or death were
also reported in severe DILI cases. Therefore, DILI-related events are strictly
monitored for all approved drugs and the liver toxicity became important
assessments for new drug candidates. These DILI-related reports are documented
in hospital records, in clinical trial results, and also in research papers
that contain preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conventionally, data
extraction from previous publications relies heavily on resource-demanding
manual labelling, which considerably decreased the efficiency of the
information extraction process. The recent development of artificial
intelligence, particularly, the rise of natural language processing (NLP)
techniques, enabled the automatic processing of biomedical texts. In this
study, based on around 28,000 papers (titles and abstracts) provided by the
Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) challenge, we benchmarked
model performances on filtering out DILI literature. Among four word
vectorization techniques, the model using term frequency-inverse document
frequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression outperformed others with an accuracy
of 0.957 with our in-house test set. Furthermore, an ensemble model with
similar overall performances was implemented and was fine-tuned to lower the
false-negative cases to avoid neglecting potential DILI reports. The ensemble
model achieved a high accuracy of 0.954 and an F1 score of 0.955 in the
hold-out validation data provided by the CAMDA committee. Moreover, important
words in positive/negative predictions were identified via model
interpretation. Overall, the ensemble model reached satisfactory classification
results, which can be further used by researchers to rapidly filter

another light on this topic by bringing new theoretical feedback. To achieve
this goal, the AVXSF-LNG computer program has been upgraded to model
second-chance reactions using its decay-probability module and, then chained to
the TALYS-ECIS06 nuclear reaction system of codes. Present diligent calculation
of the (n,2n) cross section over the energy range from the threshold to the
onset of third-chance fission at about 12 MeV, suggests that current
evaluations under-estimate the 239Pu(n,2n) cross section below 10 MeV;
under-estimation of the order of 7% relatively to the JEFF-3.1 evaluation. On
this ground, we propose an upward correction to the normalization of the
measurement by Meot et al. Correction factor of about 1.24 with a maximum
uncertainty on present fitted model estimated to 11.6%. Latter value is

heuristic (D-H) solution algorithm to solve large-scale instances of the urban
crowdsourced shared-trip package delivery problem. The D-H begins by dividing
the packages between shared personal vehicles (SPVs) and dedicated vehicles
(DVs). For package-assignment to SPVs, this paper enumerates the set of routes
each SPV can traverse and constructs a package-SPV route assignment problem.
For package-assignment to DVs and routing, the paper first obtains DV routes by
solving a conventional vehicle routing problem and then seeks potential
solution improvements by switching packages from SPVs to DVs. The switching
process is cost driven. The D-H significantly outperforms a commercial solver
in terms of computational efficiency, while obtaining near-optimal solutions
for small problem instances. This paper presents a city-scale case study to
analyze the important service design factors that impact the efficiency of
crowdsourced shared-trip delivery. The paper further analyzes the impact of
three important service design factors on system performance, namely (i) the
number of participating SPVs, (ii) the maximum detour willingness of SPVs, and
(iii) the depot locations. The results and findings provide meaningful insights
for industry practice, while the algorithms illustrate promise for large
real-world systems.

is characterized by the presence of beta-amyloid extracellular plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles containing hyper-phosphorylated tau. Individuals
carrying the apolipoprotein E-e4 (APOE-e4) allele are at increased risk of
cognitive decline and developing AD pathology. The development of positron
emission tomography (PET) radioligands sensitive to tau neurofibrillary
tangles, such as 18F-AV1451, has allowed for visualization and assessment of AD
pathology in vivo. The radioligand used in 18F-AV1451 binds with iron in
addition to tau neurofibrillary tangles. We employ multimodal neuroimaging
analyses, combining iron-sensitive measures from MRI with 18F-AV1451 PET, to
examine off-target binding effects in cohorts of 20 APOE-e4 negative, 20
APOE-e4 positive MCI, and 29 control participants. Increased tau pathology,
after controlling for tissue susceptibility, was found in the temporal lobe and
hippocampus of APOE-e4+ MCI participants as compared to APOE-e4 negative MCI
and control participants. Tau pathology in the hippocampus was significantly
related to memory, but only in APOE-e4+ participants. Correlations between
hippocampal 18F-AV1451 PET uptake and cognitive correlations did not
significantly differ when correcting for the influence of iron on 18F-AV1451
PET signal. However, controlling for susceptibility was found to influence
correlations between tau-PET uptake and diffusion metrics and the change in
this interaction may be due to the influence of iron on diffusivity. Taken
together, these results suggest that iron does not need to be accounted for in
group comparisons of tau-PET uptake or correlations between cognitive measures
and tau-PET SUVR. However, iron should be taken into account in correlations
between diffusion measures and tau-PET uptake.

perturbations on the power supply of fiber optic transoceanic cables that may
produce a global internet blackout. In this paper we give the expression of the
voltage variations that a transient change of the geomagnetic field induces on
the voltage of the power supply of a transoceanic fiber optic cable. We show
that the transient voltage change is proportional to the magnitude of the
magnetic field deviations and not to its time derivative as a direct
application of Faraday's law would imply, and this suggests design criteria to
protect transoceanic fiber optic systems against big geomagnetic storm events.
The presented analysis also enables the classification of existing systems into
some that are less sensitive to the weakening of the geomagnetic field
occurring during strong geomagnetic storms and others that are more prone to
experience an outage when a weakening of the geomagnetic field occurs.
