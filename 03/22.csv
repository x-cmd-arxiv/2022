computational geometry subjects whereabouts the problems to be studied are
complex geometric objects which by their nature require optimized techniques to
be deployed or to gain useful insights by them. MCMC approaches are directly
answering to geometric problems we are attempting to answer, and how these
problems could be deployed from theory to practice. Polytope which is a limited
volume in n-dimensional space specified by a collection of linear inequality
constraints require specific approximation. Therefore, sampling across density
based polytopes can not be performed without the use of such methods in which
the amount of repetition required is defined as a property of error margin. In
this work we propose a simple accurate sampling approach based on the
triangulation (tessellation) of a polytope. Moreover, we propose an efficient
algorithm named Density Based Sampling on Polytopes (DBSOP) for speedy MCMC
sampling where the time required to perform sampling is significantly lower
compared to existing approaches in low dimensions with complexity
$\mathcal{O}^{*}\left(n^{3}\right)$. Ultimately, we highlight possible future
aspects and how the proposed scheme can be further improved with the
integration of reservoir-sampling based methods resulting in more speedy and
efficient solution.

determined in terms of the number of colours and the number of quark flavours.
We study several aspects of the extended model and compare our results to the
standard NJL model, where a constant coupling is used in combination with a
sharp cutoff to regularize the gap equation. We show that the modified coupling
regularizes the model like a smooth cutoff and reproduces the pion mass and
decay constant, providing an almost exact Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation at

automatically due to the fact that training phase includes inference. In this

fully connected layer is calculated by an FPGA board. It should be noted that
the training of convolutional layer is not taken into account in this design

information integration, and bounding box estimation. To simplify this pipeline
and unify the process of feature extraction and target information integration,
we present a compact tracking framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon
transformers. Our core design is to utilize the flexibility of attention
operations, and propose a Mixed Attention Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature
extraction and target information integration. This synchronous modeling scheme
allows to extract target-specific discriminative features and perform extensive
communication between target and search area. Based on MAM, we build our
MixFormer tracking framework simply by stacking multiple MAMs with progressive
patch embedding and placing a localization head on top. In addition, to handle
multiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric
attention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective
score prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer sets a
new state-of-the-art performance on five tracking benchmarks, including LaSOT,
TrackingNet, VOT2020, GOT-10k, and UAV123. In particular, our MixFormer-L
achieves NP score of 79.9% on LaSOT, 88.9% on TrackingNet and EAO of 0.555 on
VOT2020. We also perform in-depth ablation studies to demonstrate the
effectiveness of simultaneous feature extraction and information integration.

to update the gPC expansions of the stress, strain and internal forces. The
proposed method is applied to a reinforced concrete beam with uncertain initial
concrete modulus of elasticity and a shear wall with uncertain maximum
compressive stress of concrete, and the results are compared to those of
stochastic collocation and Monte Carlo methods. Since the systems of equations
obtained in the linearization scheme using the stochastic Galerkin method are
very large, and there are typically many load increments, we also studied
iterative solution using preconditioned conjugate gradients. The efficiency of
the proposed method is illustrated by a set of numerical experiments.

specified density on the positive half-line and all initially at rest. The
particle masses alternate between two values, $m$ and $M$. The particles
interact via collisions that conserve energy and momentum. We study the cascade
of activity that results when the left-most particle is given a positive
velocity. At long times we find that this leads to two fascinating features in
the observed dynamics. First, in the bulk of the gas, a shock front develops
separating the cold gas from a thermalized region. The shock-front travels
sub-ballistically, with the bulk described by self-similar solutions of Euler
hydrodynamics. Second, there is a splash region formed by the recoiled
particles which move ballistically with negative velocities. The splash region
is completely non-hydrodynamic and we propose two conjectures for the long time
particle dynamics in this region. We provide a detailed analytic understanding
of these coexisting regimes. These are supported by the results of molecular
dynamics simulations.

behavior of slender structures. Prestrained elastic plates show spontaneous
bending in equilibrium -- a property that makes such objects relevant for the
fabrication of active and functional materials. In this paper we study
microheterogeneous, prestrained plates that feature nonflat equilibrium shapes.
Our goal is to understand the relation between the properties of the
prestrained microstructure and the global shape of the plate in mechanical
equilibrium. To this end, we consider a three-dimensional, nonlinear elasticity
model that describes a periodic material that occupies a domain with small
thickness. We consider a spatially periodic prestrain described in the form of
a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. By simultaneous
homogenization and dimension reduction, we rigorously derive an effective plate
model as a {\Gamma}-limit for vanishing thickness and period. That limit has
the form of a nonlinear bending energy with an emergent spontaneous curvature
term. The homogenized properties of the bending model (bending stiffness and
spontaneous curvature) are characterized by corrector problems. For a model
composite -- a prestrained laminate composed of isotropic materials -- we
investigate the dependence of the homogenized properties on the parameters of
the model composite. Secondly, we investigate the relation between the
parameters of the model composite and the set of shapes with minimal bending
energy. Our study reveals a rather complex dependence of these shapes on the
composite parameters.

in practice, but they are in general unable to provide helpful explanations for
the predictions they make. In this work we propose a model-agnostic algorithm
that generates counterfactual ensemble explanations for time series anomaly
detection models. Our method generates a set of diverse counterfactual
examples, i.e, multiple perturbed versions of the original time series that are
not considered anomalous by the detection model. Since the magnitude of the
perturbations is limited, these counterfactuals represent an ensemble of inputs
similar to the original time series that the model would deem normal. Our
algorithm is applicable to any differentiable anomaly detection model. We
investigate the value of our method on univariate and multivariate real-world
datasets and two deep-learning-based anomaly detection models, under several
explainability criteria previously proposed in other data domains such as
Validity, Plausibility, Closeness and Diversity. We show that our algorithm can
produce ensembles of counterfactual examples that satisfy these criteria and
thanks to a novel type of visualisation, can convey a richer interpretation of
a model's internal mechanism than existing methods. Moreover, we design a
sparse variant of our method to improve the interpretability of counterfactual
explanations for high-dimensional time series anomalies. In this setting, our
explanation is localised on only a few dimensions and can therefore be
communicated more efficiently to the model's user.

the equilibrium phase diagram of two interacting Bose condensates. We consider
a dynamical setup in which two wave packets are initially at rest with a small
separation about the center of an asymmetric harmonic trap. Upon release, we
observe a rapid approach to dynamical equilibrium in the limits of very large

intermediate, critical regime is characterized by extended transient dynamics,
density fracturing, and dynamical mixing. We therefore have reason to believe

condensates as a result of their non-linear interactions, and these effects may
be observable in a suitable laboratory environment.

image editing tasks using pre-trained generators. Existing methods typically
employ the latent space of GANs as the inversion space yet observe the
insufficient recovery of spatial details. In this work, we propose to involve
the padding space of the generator to complement the latent space with spatial

used in convolution layers with some instance-aware coefficients. In this way,
the inductive bias assumed in the pre-trained model can be appropriately
adapted to fit each individual image. Through learning a carefully designed
encoder, we manage to improve the inversion quality both qualitatively and
quantitatively, outperforming existing alternatives. We then demonstrate that
such a space extension barely affects the native GAN manifold, hence we can
still reuse the prior knowledge learned by GANs for various downstream
applications. Beyond the editing tasks explored in prior arts, our approach
allows a more flexible image manipulation, such as the separate control of face
contour and facial details, and enables a novel editing manner where users can
customize their own manipulations highly efficiently.

security, particularly in intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly
detection. Machine learning solutions have also been employed in IDSs to detect
known and plausible attacks in incoming traffic. Parameters such as packet
contents, sender IP and sender port, connection duration, etc. have been
previously used to train these machine learning models to learn to
differentiate genuine traffic from malicious ones. Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) have been significantly successful in detecting such anomalies,
mostly attributed to the adversarial training of the generator and
discriminator in an attempt to bypass each other and in turn increase their own
power and accuracy. However, in large networks having a wide variety of traffic
at possibly different regions of the network and susceptible to a large number
of potential attacks, training these GANs for a particular kind of anomaly may
make it oblivious to other anomalies and attacks. In addition, the dataset
required to train these models has to be made centrally available and publicly
accessible, posing the obvious question of privacy of the communications of the
respective participants of the network. The solution proposed in this work aims
at tackling the above two issues by using GANs in a federated architecture in
networks of such scale and capacity. In such a setting, different users of the
network will be able to train and customize a centrally available adversarial
model according to their own frequently faced conditions. Simultaneously, the
member users of the network will also able to gain from the experiences of the
other users in the network.

repaired with trajectory optimization, which also provides new improved motion
primitives. Our novel kinodynamic motion planner, kMP-db-A*, has almost surely
asymptotic optimal behavior and computes near-optimal solutions quickly. For

difficult deployment of these solutions. To address this issue, we introduce a
new technique to decompose the extraction of multiscale spatiotemporal
features. Particularly, a building block structure called Decomposed Multiscale
Spatiotemporal Network (DMSN) is presented along with three variants: DMSN-A,
DMSN-B, and DMSN-C blocks. The DMSN-A block generates multiscale
representations by analyzing spatiotemporal features at multiple temporal
ranges, while the DMSN-B block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple
ranges, and the DMSN-C block analyzes spatiotemporal features at multiple
spatial sizes. Using these variants, we design our DMSN architecture which has
the ability to explore a variety of multiscale spatiotemporal features,
favoring the adaptation to different facial behaviors. Our extensive
experiments on challenging datasets show that the DMSN-C block is effective for
depression detection, whereas the DMSN-A block is efficient for pain
estimation. Results also indicate that our DMSN architecture provides a
cost-effective solution for expressions that range from fewer facial variations
over time, as in depression detection, to greater variations, as in pain
estimation.

for finding eigenvalues and eigenstates of a Hamiltonian. However, the original
QITE proposal [Nat. Phys. 16, 205-210 (2020)], which approximates the imaginary
time evolution by real time evolution, suffers from large circuit depth and
measurements due to the size of the Pauli operator pool and Trotterization. To
alleviate the requirement for deep circuits, we propose a time-dependent
drifting scheme inspired by the qDRIFT algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett 123, 070503
(2019)], which randomly draws a Pauli term out of the approximated unitary
operation generators of QITE according to the strength and rescales that term
by the total strength of the Pauli terms. We show that this drifting scheme
removes the depth dependency on size of the operator pool and converges inverse
linearly to the number of steps. We further propose a deterministic algorithm
that selects the dominant Pauli term to reduce the fluctuation for the ground
state preparation. Meanwhile, we introduce an efficient measurement reduction
scheme across Trotter steps, which removes its cost dependence on the number of
iterations, and a measurement distribution protocol for different observables
within each time step. We also analyze the main source of error for our scheme
both theoretically and numerically. We numerically test the validity of depth
reduction, convergence performance, and faithfulness of measurement reduction
approximation of our algorithms on LiH, BeH$_2$ and N$_2$ molecules. In
particular, the results on LiH molecule give circuit depths comparable to that

clouds. However, it is difficult to directly apply flow-based models to dynamic
point cloud classification since the unstructured points make it hard or even
impossible to efficiently and effectively trace point-wise correspondences. To
capture 3D motions without explicitly tracking correspondences, we propose a
kinematics-inspired neural network (Kinet) by generalizing the kinematic
concept of ST-surfaces to the feature space. By unrolling the normal solver of
ST-surfaces in the feature space, Kinet implicitly encodes feature-level
dynamics and gains advantages from the use of mature backbones for static point
cloud processing. With only minor changes in network structures and low
computing overhead, it is painless to jointly train and deploy our framework
with a given static model. Experiments on NvGesture, SHREC'17, MSRAction-3D,
and NTU-RGBD demonstrate its efficacy in performance, efficiency in both the
number of parameters and computational complexity, as well as its versatility
to various static backbones. Noticeably, Kinet achieves the accuracy of 93.27%
on MSRAction-3D with only 3.20M parameters and 10.35G FLOPS.

  of JavaScript and TypeScript Applications on GitHub","Accepted at MSR '22 (19th International Conference on Mining Software
  Repositories)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  JavaScript (JS) is one of the most popular programming languages, and widely
used for web apps and even backend development. Due to its dynamic nature,
however, JS applications often have a reputation for poor software quality. As
a type-safe superset of JavaScript, TypeScript (TS) offers features to address
this. However, there is currently insufficient empirical evidence to broadly
support the claim that TS apps exhibit better software quality than JS apps.
  We therefore conducted a repository mining study based on 604 GitHub projects
(299 for JS, 305 for TS) with over 16M LoC and collected four facets of
software quality: a) code quality (# of code smells per LoC), b) code
understandability (cognitive complexity per LoC), c) bug proneness (bug fix
commit ratio), and d) bug resolution time (mean time a bug issue is open). For
TS, we also collected how frequently the type-safety ignoring `any` type was
used.
  The analysis indicates that TS apps exhibit significantly better code quality
and understandability than JS apps. Contrary to expectations, however, bug
proneness and bug resolution time of our TS sample were not significantly lower
than for JS: mean bug fix commit ratio was more than 60% larger (0.126 vs.
0.206), and TS projects needed on average more than an additional day to fix
bugs (31.86 vs. 33.04 days). Furthermore, reducing the usage of the `any` type
in TS apps was significantly correlated with all metrics except bug proneness
(Spearman's rho between 0.17 and 0.26).
  Our results indicate that the perceived positive influence of TypeScript for
avoiding bugs in comparison to JavaScript may be more complicated than assumed.
While using TS seems to have benefits, it does not automatically lead to less
and easier to fix bugs. However, more research is needed in this area,
especially concerning the potential influence of project complexity and
developer experience.

combination of TDMA and CSMA while offsetting the high overhead of time slot
assignment by allocating the time slots to sensor nodes based on their location
information. This design avoids high computation complexity of time slot
assignment incurred by node mobility and node failure. The area which the
wireless sensor network occupies is divided into blocks and each block is
associated with an inter-block time slot and an intra-block time slot. In the
inter-block time slot, the sensor nodes stay active and receive the packets
from nodes outside of the block. In the intra-block time slot, the sensor nodes
communicate with peer nodes in the same block under CSMA. Sensor nodes stay
sleep in all other time slots unless they have traffic to send. L-MAC is
implemented and evaluated in NS-2.

counter-intuitively accelerates the evolution of a biological oscillator and,
thus, can impart a benefit to living organisms. We used computer simulations to
evolve two mechanistic models of a biological oscillator at different levels of
gene expression noise. We first show that gene expression noise induces
oscillatory-like dynamics in regions of parameter space that cannot oscillate
in the absence of noise. We then demonstrate that these noise-induced
oscillations generate a fitness landscape whose gradient robustly and quickly
guides evolution by mutation towards robust and self-sustaining oscillation.
These results suggest that noise can help dynamical systems evolve or learn new
behavior by revealing cryptic dynamic phenotypes outside the bifurcation point.

among stakeholders toward identifying practical solutions to make the most
productive use of the exclusively allocated bands on a shared basis through
spectrum sharing mechanisms. However, due to the technical complexities of
these mechanisms, their design presents challenges, as it requires coordination
among multiple entities. To address this challenge, in this paper, we begin
with a detailed review of the recent literature on spectrum sharing methods,
classifying them on the basis of their operational frequency regime that is,
whether they are implemented to operate in licensed bands (e.g., licensed
shared access (LSA), spectrum access system (SAS), and dynamic spectrum sharing
(DSS)) or unlicensed bands (e.g., LTE-unlicensed (LTE-U), licensed assisted

narrow the gap between the standardization and vendor-specific implementations,
we provide a detailed review of the potential implementation scenarios and
necessary amendments to legacy cellular networks from the perspective of
telecom vendors and regulatory bodies. Next, we analyze applications of
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for
facilitating spectrum sharing mechanisms and leveraging the full potential of
autonomous sharing scenarios. Finally, we conclude the paper by presenting open

the minimal quantum metric -- the metric with minimum trace -- is related to
the superfluid weight in isolated flat bands. We complement this result with an
exact calculation of the Cooper pair mass in attractive Hubbard models with the
uniform pairing condition. When the orbitals are located at high symmetry
positions, the Cooper pair mass is exactly given by the quantum metric, which
is guaranteed to be minimal. Moreover, we study the effect of closing the band
gap between the flat and dispersive bands, and develop a mean-field theory of
pairing for different band-touching points via the $S$-matrix construction. In
mean field, we show that a non-isolated flat band can actually be beneficial
for superconductivity. This is a promising result in the search for high
temperature superconductivity as the material does not need to have flat bands
that are isolated from other bands by the thermal energy. Our work resolves a
fundamental caveat in understanding the relation of multiband superconductivity
to quantum geometry, and the results on band touchings widen the class of
systems advantageous for the search of high temperature flat band
superconductivity.

a complete understanding of the brain's learning algorithms is still missing.
Artificial neural networks provide a powerful learning paradigm through the
backpropagation algorithm which modifies synaptic weights by using feedback
connections. Backpropagation requires extensive communication of information
back through the layers of a network. This has been argued to be biologically
implausible and it is not clear whether backpropagation can be realized in the
brain. Here we suggest that biophotons guided by axons provide a potential
channel for backward transmission of information in the brain. Biophotons have
been experimentally shown to be produced in the brain, yet their purpose is not
understood. We propose that biophotons can propagate from each post-synaptic
neuron to its pre-synaptic one to carry the required information backward. To
reflect the stochastic character of biophoton emissions, our model includes the
stochastic backward transmission of teaching signals. We demonstrate that a
three-layered network of neurons can learn the MNIST handwritten digit
classification task using our proposed backpropagation-like algorithm with
stochastic photonic feedback. We model realistic restrictions and show that our
system still learns the task for low rates of biophoton emission,
information-limited (one bit per photon) backward transmission, and in the
presence of noise photons. Our results suggest a new functionality for
biophotons and provide an alternate mechanism for backward transmission in the

worldwide to abruptly transition from working in offices to working from their
homes. During two years of predominantly working from home, employees and
managers alike formed expectations about what post-pandemic working life should
look like. Many companies are currently experimenting with new work policies
that balance both employee- and manager expectations to where, when and how
work should be done in the future. In this article, we gather experiences from
17 companies and their sites, covering 12 countries. We share the results of
corporate surveys of employee preferences for working from home and analyse new
work policies. Our results are threefold. First, through the new work policies
all companies are formally giving more flexibility to the employees with
regards to working time and work location. Second, there is a great variation
in how much flexibility the companies are willing to yield to the employees.
The variation is related both to industry type, size of the companies, and
company culture. Third, we document a change in the psychological contract
between employees and managers, where the option of working from home is
converted from an exclusive perk that managers could choose to give to the few,
to a core privilege that all employees feel they are entitled to. Finally,
there are indications that as the companies learn and solicit feedback
regarding the efficiency of the chosen strategies, we might see further
developments and changes of the work policies with respect to how much
flexibility to work whenever and from anywhere they grant. Through these
findings, the paper contributes to a growing literature about the new trends
emerging from the pandemic in tech companies and spells out practical

receives sounds from a point in space, and depends on the shapes of one's head,

in enabling binaural acoustic applications such as sound localization and 3D
sound spatialization. Unfortunately, conventional approaches for HRTF
estimation rely on specialized devices or lengthy measurement processes. This
work proposes a novel lightweight method for HRTF individualization that can be
implemented using commercial-off-the-shelf components and performed by average
users in home settings. The proposed method has two key components: a
generative neural network model that can be individualized to predict HRTFs of
new subjects from sparse measurements, and a lightweight measurement procedure
that collects HRTF data from spatial locations. Extensive experiments using a
public dataset and in house measurement data from 10 subjects of different ages
and genders, show that the individualized models significantly outperform a
baseline model in the accuracy of predicted HRTFs. To further demonstrate the
advantages of individualized HRTFs, we implement two prototype applications for
binaural localization and acoustic spatialization. We find that the performance
of a localization model is improved by 15 degree after trained with
individualized HRTFs. Furthermore, in hearing tests, the success rate of
correctly identifying the azimuth direction of incoming sounds increases by
183% after individualization.

the foreground points are inherently more important than background points for
object detectors. Motivated by this, we propose a highly-efficient single-stage
point-based 3D detector in this paper, termed IA-SSD. The key of our approach
is to exploit two learnable, task-oriented, instance-aware downsampling
strategies to hierarchically select the foreground points belonging to objects
of interest. Additionally, we also introduce a contextual centroid perception
module to further estimate precise instance centers. Finally, we build our
IA-SSD following the encoder-only architecture for efficiency. Extensive

the competitive performance of our IA-SSD. Thanks to the low memory footprint

transparent to spin waves. This result is derived by approximating the dipolar
interaction between magnetic moments by an effective anisotropy interaction. In
this paper we study the the scattering of spin waves by a domain wall taking
into account the full complexity of the dipolar interaction, treating it
perturbatively in the distorted wave Born approximation. Due to the
peculiarities of the dipolar interaction, the implementation of this
approximation is not straightforward. The difficulties are circumvented here by
realizing that the contribution of the dipolar interaction to the spin wave
operator can be split into two terms: i) an operator that commutes with the
spin wave operator in absence of dipolar interaction, and ii) a local operator
suitable to be treated as a perturbation in the distorted wave Born
approximaton. We analyze the scattering parameters obtained within this
approach. It turns out that the reflection coefficient does not vanish in
general, and that the transmitted waves suffer a lateral shift even at normal
incidence. This lateral shift can be greatlty enhanced by making the spin wave
go through an array of well separated domain walls. The outgoing spin wave will
no be attenuated by the scattering at the domain walls since the reflection
coefficient vanishes at normal incidence. This effect may be very useful to
control the spin waves in magnonic devices.

verification (SV) methods for gridded prediction, which overcome serious
disadvantages of pixelwise verification. However, neural networks (NN) in
atmospheric science are almost always trained to optimize pixelwise loss
functions, even when ultimately assessed with SV methods. This establishes a
disconnect between model verification during vs. after training. To address
this issue, we develop spatially enhanced loss functions (SELF) and demonstrate
their use for a real-world problem: predicting the occurrence of thunderstorms
(henceforth, ""convection"") with NNs. In each SELF we use either a neighbourhood
filter, which highlights convection at scales larger than a threshold, or a
spectral filter (employing Fourier or wavelet decomposition), which is more
flexible and highlights convection at scales between two thresholds. We use
these filters to spatially enhance common verification scores, such as the
Brier score. We train each NN with a different SELF and compare their
performance at many scales of convection, from discrete storm cells to tropical
cyclones. Among our many findings are that (a) for a low (high) risk threshold,
the ideal SELF focuses on small (large) scales; (b) models trained with a
pixelwise loss function perform surprisingly well; (c) however, models trained
with a spectral filter produce much better-calibrated probabilities than a
pixelwise model. We provide a general guide to using SELFs, including technical
challenges and the final Python code, as well as demonstrating their use for

measurement formalism by replacing the familiar pointer variable with an array

upper-semi-continuous convex-valued correspondence $F$ defined on $X\times
C^k$? The answer is yes, and we present such an example. We show that this

be measurable in the same finitely additive way. Because non-empty

measurement precision, hence they hold the power to put theoretical ideas to
the most stringent tests yet. However, in order to realise the full potential
of these measurements, we need to ensure that we apply the most effective
analytical tools. We need to identify which cosmological observables are the
best cosmological probes. Two commonly used cosmological observables are galaxy
redshift number counts and cosmic magnification. Both of these observables have
been investigated extensively in cosmological analyses, but only separately. In
the light of interacting dark energy (IDE) emerging as a plausible means of
alleviating current cosmological tensions, we investigate both observables on
large scales in a universe with IDE, using the angular power spectrum: taking
into account all known terms, including relativistic corrections, in the
observed overdensity. Our results suggest that (given multi-tracer analysis)
measuring relativistic effects with cosmic magnification will be relatively
better than with galaxy redshift number counts, at all redshifts z. Conversely,
without relativistic effects, galaxy redshift number counts will be relatively
better in probing the imprint of IDE, at all z. At low z (up to around z =
0.1), relativistic effects enable cosmic magnification to be a relatively
better probe of the IDE imprint; while at higher z (up to z < 3), galaxy
redshift number counts become the better probe of IDE imprint. However, at z =
3 and higher, our results suggest that either of the observables will suffice.

of an object proposal module that analyzes the LiDAR point cloud to obtain
proposals for spatially consistent objects. Second, we show that these 3D

into semantically meaningful pseudo-classes. Finally, we develop a cross-modal

on four different testing datasets (Cityscapes, Dark Zurich, Nighttime Driving

mainly relied on force-matching or relative entropy minimization, which require
many samples from costly simulations with all-atom or CG resolutions,

fields that combines the advantages of both methods by leveraging normalizing
flows, a generative deep learning method. Flow-matching first trains a
normalizing flow to represent the CG probability density, which is equivalent
to minimizing the relative entropy without requiring iterative CG simulations.
Subsequently, the flow generates samples and forces according to the learned
distribution in order to train the desired CG free energy model via force
matching. Even without requiring forces from the all-atom simulations,
flow-matching outperforms classical force-matching by an order of magnitude in
terms of data efficiency, and produces CG models that can capture the folding

meteorites reveal the existence and abundances of these now-extinct
radionuclides; and the evidence that the SLR ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$, which uniquely
among the SLRs is not produced during typical stellar nucleosynthesis, was
distributed homogeneously in the solar nebula. We review the evidence that the
SLRs ${}^{26}{\rm Al}$, ${}^{53}{\rm Mn}$, and ${}^{182}{\rm Hf}$, and other
radionuclides, were also homogeneously distributed and can be used to date
events during the Solar System's planet-forming epoch. The homogeneity of the
SLRs, especially ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$, strongly suggests they were all inherited
from the Sun's molecular cloud, and that production by irradiation within the
solar nebula was very limited, except for ${}^{36}{\rm Cl}$. We review
astrophysical models for the origin of ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$, showing that it
requires that the Sun formed in a spiral arm of the Galaxy with higher star
formation rate than the Galaxy-wide average. Likewise, we review the
astrophysical models for the origins of the other SLRs and show that they
likely arose from contamination of the Sun's molecular cloud by massive stars
over tens of Myr, most likely dominated by ejecta from Wolf-Rayet stars. The
other SLRs also demand formation of the Sun in a spiral arm of the Galaxy with
a star formation rate as high as demanded by the Solar System initial
${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ abundance. We discuss the astrophysical implications, and
suggest further tests of these models and future directions for the field.

us better use GANs for downstream applications. Existing efforts mainly target
interpreting unconditional models, leaving it less explored how a conditional
GAN learns to render images regarding various categories. This work fills in
this gap by investigating how a class conditional generator unifies the
synthesis of multiple classes. For this purpose, we dive into the widely used
class-conditional batch normalization (CCBN), and observe that each feature
channel is activated at varying degrees given different categorical embeddings.
To describe such a phenomenon, we propose channel awareness, which
quantitatively characterizes how a single channel contributes to the final
synthesis. Extensive evaluations and analyses on the BigGAN model pre-trained
on ImageNet reveal that only a subset of channels is primarily responsible for
the generation of a particular category, similar categories (e.g., cat and dog)
usually get related to some same channels, and some channels turn out to share
information across all classes. For good measure, our algorithm enables several
novel applications with conditional GANs. Concretely, we achieve (1) versatile
image editing via simply altering a single channel and manage to (2)
harmoniously hybridize two different classes. We further verify that the
proposed channel awareness shows promising potential in (3) segmenting the
synthesized image and (4) evaluating the category-wise synthesis performance.

introduce a network NFlowNet, for normal flow estimation which is used to
enforce robust and direct constraints. In particular, normal flow is used to
estimate relative camera pose based on the cheirality (depth positivity)

the bottleneck of hand-designing rewards in environments where task supervision

RL techniques, make a fundamental assumption - stationary environments during
training. Traditional methods learn all their skills simultaneously, which
makes it difficult for them to both quickly adapt to changes in the
environment, and to not forget earlier skills after such adaptation. On the
other hand, in an evolving or expanding environment, skill learning must be
able to adapt fast to new environment situations while not forgetting
previously learned skills. These two conditions make it difficult for classic
skill discovery to do well in an evolving environment. In this work, we propose
a new framework for skill discovery, where skills are learned one after another
in an incremental fashion. This framework allows newly learned skills to adapt
to new environment or agent dynamics, while the fixed old skills ensure the
agent doesn't forget a learned skill. We demonstrate experimentally that in

provide huge training data in biomedical magnetic resonance without or with few
real data. Following the physical law of magnetic resonance, IPADS generates
signals from differential equations or analytical solution models, making the
learning more scalable, explainable, and better protecting privacy. Key
components of IPADS learning, including signal generation models, basic deep
learning network structures, enhanced data generation, and learning methods are
discussed. Great potentials of IPADS have been demonstrated by representative
applications in fast imaging, ultrafast signal reconstruction and accurate
parameter quantification. Finally, open questions and future work have been
discussed.

magnetic fields play throughout the star formation process, gained through
observations and simulations of molecular clouds, the dense, star-forming phase
of the magnetised, turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). Recent results broadly
support a picture in which the magnetic fields of molecular clouds transition
from being gravitationally sub-critical and near equipartition with turbulence
in low-density cloud envelopes, to being energetically sub-dominant in dense,
gravitationally unstable star-forming cores. Magnetic fields appear to play an
important role in the formation of cloud substructure by setting preferred
directions for large-scale gas flows in molecular clouds, and can direct the
accretion of material onto star-forming filaments and hubs. Low-mass star
formation may proceed in environments close to magnetic criticality; high-mass
star formation remains less well-understood, but may proceed in more
supercritical environments. The interaction between magnetic fields and
(proto)stellar feedback may be particularly important in setting star formation
efficiency. We also review a range of widely-used techniques for quantifying
the dynamic importance of magnetic fields, concluding that better-calibrated
diagnostics are required in order to use the spectacular range of forthcoming
observations and simulations to quantify our emerging understanding of how
magnetic fields influence the outcome of the star formation process.

bridge this gap by proposing a discriminative mask pretraining Transformer

cloud as discrete occupancy values (1 if part of the point cloud; 0 if not),
and perform simple binary classification between masked object points and
sampled noise points as the proxy task. In this way, our approach is robust to
the point sampling variance in point clouds, and facilitates learning rich
representations. We evaluate our pretrained models across several downstream
tasks, including 3D shape classification, segmentation, and real-word object
detection, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results while achieving a
significant pretraining speedup (e.g., 4.1x on ScanNet) compared to the prior

method (DGSEM) using collocation of quadrature and interpolation points. We
modify the integrals over discretization elements where we replace the physical
fluxes and nonconservative products by two-point numerical fluctuations. The
contributions of this work are threefold. First, we analyze the semi-discrete
DGSEM discretization and prove that the scheme is high-order accurate,
free-stream preserving, and entropy stable when excluding material interfaces.
Second, we design a three-point scheme with a HLLC solver that does not require
a root-finding algorithm for approximating the nonconservative products. The
scheme is proved to be robust and entropy stable for convex entropies,
preserves uniform states across material interfaces, satisfies a discrete
minimum principle on the specific entropy and maximum principles on the EOS
parameters. Third, the HLLC solver is applied at interfaces in the DGSEM
scheme, while we consider two kinds of fluctuations in the integrals over
discretization elements: material interface preserving and entropy
conservative. Time integration is performed using SSP Runge-Kutta schemes. The
high-order accuracy, nonlinear stability, and robustness of the present scheme

spatially polarized wave fronts. The spatial variation of polarization gives
rise to diffraction, opening the possibility to manipulate the beam shape and
propagation direction via polarization control. We describe and simulate the

experimentally demonstrate polarization control with a Bessel beam. Lensing in

determinants: symmetric, nonsymmetric, and partition-constrained determinantal
point processes, as well as planar perfect matchings. For these distributions,
the partition function, a.k.a. the count, can be obtained via matrix
determinants, a highly parallelizable computation; Csanky proved it is in NC.
However, parallel counting does not automatically translate to parallel
sampling, as classic reductions between the two are inherently sequential. We
show that a nearly quadratic parallel speedup over sequential sampling can be
achieved for all the aforementioned distributions. If the distribution is
supported on subsets of size $k$ of a ground set, we show how to approximately
produce a sample in $\widetilde{O}(k^{\frac{1}{2} + c})$ time with polynomially
many processors for any constant $c>0$. In the two special cases of symmetric
determinantal point processes and planar perfect matchings, our bound improves
to $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt k)$ and we show how to sample exactly in these cases.
  As our main technical contribution, we fully characterize the limits of
batching for the steps of sampling-to-counting reductions. We observe that only
$O(1)$ steps can be batched together if we strive for exact sampling, even in
the case of nonsymmetric determinantal point processes. However, we show that
for approximate sampling, $\widetilde{\Omega}(k^{\frac{1}{2}-c})$ steps can be
batched together, for any entropically independent distribution, which includes
all mentioned classes of determinantal point processes. Entropic independence

The model is inspired by, and closely related to, the Beta-VAE model of
concepts, but is designed to be more closely connected with language, so that
the names of concepts form part of the graphical model. We provide evidence
that our model -- which we call the Conceptual VAE -- is able to learn
interpretable conceptual representations from simple images of coloured shapes
together with the corresponding concept labels. We also show how the model can
be used as a concept classifier, and how it can be adapted to learn from fewer
labels per instance. Finally, we formally relate our model to Gardenfors'
theory of conceptual spaces, showing how the Gaussians we use to represent
concepts can be formalised in terms of ""fuzzy concepts"" in such a space.

selection defined by solely using the distribution of Type I and Type II
optical spectroscopic AGNs in WISE mid-IR color space. Our selection is an
improvement of $\sim$50% in the completeness of targeting spectroscopic AGNs

a less luminous population of AGNs, with on average lower [O III] luminosities

local universe and the one obtained from the Planck collaboration representing
an all-sky value for the early universe reached the 5-$\sigma$ level.
Approaches to alleviate the tension contain a wide range of ansatzes:
increasing uncertainties in data acquisition, reducing biases in the
astrophysical models that underly the probes, or taking into account
observer-dependent variances in the parameters of the cosmological background
model. Another way of interpreting the tension is to consider the density
parameters in the Friedmann equations effective background fields which are
probed at two different cosmic times, i.e. using the data of the early universe
and the late, more complex universe for two different fits of a flat
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology. The two sets of parameter
values can differ and tensions arise if these background fits and perturbing
biases are not consistently calibrated with respect to each other when they are
linked to observables because these observables are all based on common
standards. This consistent model-fitting calibration is lacking between the two
$H_0$ values mentioned above, thus causing a tension. As shown here, this
interpretation resolves the $H_0$ tension, if 15% of the matter-density
parameter obtained from the fit to the cosmic microwave background,
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.315$, are assigned to decoupled perturbations yielding
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.267$ for the fit at redshifts of the supernova
observations. Existing theoretical analyses and data evaluations which support
this solution are given.

In these models, the fundamental cosmological constant is negative, and the
universe eventually recollapses in a time-reversal symmetric way. The
microscopic description naturally selects a special state for the cosmology. In
this framework, physics in the cosmological spacetime is dual to the vacuum
physics in a static planar asymptotically AdS Lorentzian wormhole spacetime, in
the sense that the background spacetimes and observables are related by
analytic continuation. The dual spacetime is weakly curved everywhere, so any
cosmological observables can be computed in the dual picture via effective
field theory without detailed knowledge of the UV completion or the physics
near the big bang. In particular, while inflation may explain the origin of
perturbations in the cosmology picture, the perturbations can be deduced from
the dual picture without any knowledge of the inflationary potential.

matrices for non-leptonic $\Delta F=2$ transitions in the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). To this end we transform first the known
two-loop QCD anomalous dimension matrices (ADMs) of the BSM operators in the
so-called BMU basis into the ones in the common Weak Effective Theory (WET)
basis (the so-called JMS basis) for which tree-level and one-loop matching to
the SMEFT are already known. This allows us subsequently to find the two-loop
QCD ADMs for the SMEFT non-leptonic $\Delta F=2$ operators in the Warsaw basis.
Having all these ingredients we investigate the impact of these NLO QCD effects
on the QCD RG evolution of SMEFT Wilson coefficients for non-leptonic $\Delta
F=2$ transitions from the new physics scale $\Lambda$ down to the electroweak
scale $\mu_\text{ew}$. The main benefit of these new contributions is that they
allow to remove renormalization scheme dependences present both in the one-loop
matchings between the WET and SMEFT and also between SMEFT and a chosen UV
completion. But the NLO QCD effects, calculated here in the NDR scheme, turn
out to be small, in the ballpark of a few percent but larger than one-loop
Yukawa top effects when only the $\Delta F=2$ operators are considered. The
technology developed in our paper allows to obtain the ADMs in the SMEFT from
the ones of the BMU basis also for non-leptonic $\Delta F=1$ decays and the

continuously tune the $\boldsymbol{k}$-dependent electron-hole dipole moment

exactly a rational multiple of a Bravais lattice vector, which points parallel

conductivity of intrinsically polar insulators greatly exceeds $e^3/h^2$, and
is at least three orders of magnitude larger than the conductivity of the

diverges as $|E_g|^{-1/2}$ with $E_g$ the band gap, suggesting an application
to ultrafast infrared detection.

by giant stars is a possible explanation for rapidly rotating giants,
lithium-rich giants, and the presence of SBs in close orbits around subdwarfs
and white dwarfs. We simulate the flow in the vicinity of an engulfed SB in
three-dimensional hydrodynamics. We model the SB as a rigid body with a
reflective surface because it cannot accrete. This reflective boundary changes
the flow morphology to resemble that of engulfed compact objects with outflows.
We measure the drag coefficients for the ram pressure and gravitational drag
forces acting on the SB, and use them to integrate its trajectory inside the
star. We find that engulfment can increase the luminosity of a $1M_\odot$ star
by up to a few orders of magnitude. The time for the star to return to its
original luminosity is up to a few thousand years when the star has evolved to
$\approx10R_\odot$ and up to a few decades at the tip of the red giant branch.
No SBs can eject the envelope of a $1M_\odot$ star before it evolves to
$\approx10R_\odot$, if the orbit of the SB is the only energy source
contributing to the ejection. In contrast, SBs as small as
$\approx10M_\text{Jup}$ can eject the envelope at the tip of the red giant
branch. The numerical framework we introduce here can be used to study
planetary engulfment in a simplified setting that captures the physics of the
flow at the scale of the SB.

evidence for extended gas reservoirs around the first rapidly growing
supermassive black holes. Observations of $z > 6$ quasars can be explained by
cosmological models provided that the black holes by which they are powered
evolve in rare, massive dark matter haloes. Whether these theoretical models
also explain the observed extended Ly$\alpha$ emission remains an open
question. We post-process a suite of cosmological, radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations targeting a quasar host halo at $z>6$ with the Ly$\alpha$ radiative
transfer code RASCAS. A combination of recombination radiation from
photo-ionised hydrogen and emission from collisionally excited gas powers
Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with a surface brightness profile in close agreement with
observations. We also find that, even on its own, resonant scattering of the
Ly$\alpha$ line associated to the quasar's broad line region can also generate
Ly$\alpha$ emission on $\sim 100 \, \rm kpc$ scales, resulting in comparable
agreement with observed surface brightness profiles. Even if powered by a broad
quasar Ly$\alpha$ line, Ly$\alpha$ nebulae can have narrow line-widths
$\lesssim 1000 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$, consistent with observational constraints.
Even if there is no quasar, we find that halo gas cooling produces a faint,
extended Ly$\alpha$ glow. However, to light-up extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with
properties in line with observations, our simulations unambiguously require
quasar-powered outflows to clear out the galactic nucleus and allow the
Ly$\alpha$ flux to escape and still remain resonant with halo gas. The close
match between observations and simulations with quasar outflows suggests that

atmospheres of irradiated exoplanets through the dissociation of species, such
as methane and ammonia, and the association of others, such as hydrogen
cyanide. Although primarily the high altitude day side should be affected by
photochemistry, it is still unclear how dynamical processes transport
photochemical species throughout the atmosphere, and how these chemical
disequilibrium effects scale with different parameters. In this work we
investigate the influence of photochemistry in a two-dimensional context, by
synthesizing a grid of photochemical models across a large range of
temperatures. We find that photochemistry can strongly change the atmospheric
composition, even up to depths of several bar in cool exoplanets. We further
identify a sweet spot for the photochemical production of hydrogen cyanide and
acetylene, two important haze precursors, between effective temperatures of 800
and 1400 K. The night sides of most cool planets (effective temperature < 1800
K) are shown to host photochemistry products, transported from the day side by
horizontal advection. Synthetic transmission spectra are only marginally
affected by photochemistry, but we suggest that observational studies probing
higher altitudes, such as high-resolution spectroscopy, take photochemistry
into account.

parsec separations, but only very few have been confirmed at z>0.5. The
appearance of multiple AGNs at small angular separations can also be due to
gravitational lensing of single AGNs, which are themselves very important

dubbed the Gaia Multipeak (GMP) method, to obtain large and reliable samples of
dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec separations by looking for AGNs
showing multiple peaks in the light profiles observed by the Gaia satellite.
All the GMP-selected sources with high resolution images (26 from the HST

provided reliable measurements of electron beam polarization for the past two
decades reaching the typically required $\pm$1\% level of absolute uncertainty.
However, the upcoming proposed experimental program including MOLLER and SoLID
have stringent requirements on beam polarimetry precision at the level of 0.4\%
\cite{MOLLER2014, SoLID2019}, requiring a systematic re-examination of all the
contributing uncertainties.
  M{\o}ller polarimetry uses the double polarized scattering asymmetry of a
polarized electron beam on a target with polarized atomic electrons. The target
is a ferromagnetic material magnetized to align the spins in a given direction.
In Hall A, the target is a pure iron foil aligned perpendicular to the beam and
magnetized out of plane parallel or antiparallel to the beam direction. The
acceptance of the detector is engineered to collect scattered electrons close
to 90$^{\circ}$ in the center of mass frame where the analyzing power is a
maximum (-7/9).
  One of the leading systematic errors comes from determination of the target
foil polarization. Polarization of a magnetically saturated target foil
requires knowledge of both the saturation magnetization and $g^\prime$, the
electron $g$-factor which includes components from both spin and orbital
angular momentum from which the spin fraction of magnetization is determined.
This paper utilizes the existing world data to provide a best estimate for
target polarization for both nickel and iron foils including uncertainties in
magnetization, high-field and temperature dependence, and fractional
contribution to magnetization from orbital effects. We determine the foil
electron spin polarization at 294~K to be 0.08020$\pm$0.00018 (@4~T applied
field) for iron and 0.018845$\pm0.000053$ (@2~T applied field) for nickel.

the relative quark--anti-quark pair momentum that increases the invariant mass
of quark--anti-quark pairs, and a medium-enhanced production of such pairs. We
note that both effects are numerically sizeable if the average momentum
transfer from the medium is comparable to the quark mass. In ultra-relativistic
heavy-ion collisions, this condition is satisfied for charm quarks. We
therefore focus our numerical analysis on the medium modification of $g\to

and provide an opportunity to apply such methods. We show that if the tidal

values of ~$3\times10^5-3\times10^6$ and ~$1.5\times10^5-4\times10^5$,

planets. Even though some work suggests an especially large semimajor axis for
Kepler-1625 b-i, we find that this would imply a surprisingly low Q~2000 for a
gas giant unless the moon formed at essentially its current position. More
detailed predictions for the moons' initial semimajor axis could provide even
better constraints on Q, and we discuss the formation scenarios for a moon in
this context. Similar arguments can be used as more exomoons are discovered in
the future to constrain exoplanet interior properties. This could be especially
useful for exoplanets near the sub-Neptune/super-Earth radius gap where the

information-theoretic structures, which correspond to very different notions of
causation. When analysing physical experiments, these notions must be put
together in a compatible manner. The process matrix framework describes quantum
indefinite causal structures in the information-theoretic sense, but the
physicality of such processes remains an open question. At the same time, there
are several experiments in Minkowski spacetime (which implies a definite
spacetime notion of causality) that claim to have implemented indefinite
information-theoretic causal structures, suggesting an apparent tension between
these notions. To address this, we develop a general framework that
disentangles these two notions and characterises their compatibility in
scenarios where quantum systems may be delocalised over a spacetime. The
framework first describes a composition of quantum maps through feedback loops,
and then the embedding of the resulting (possibly cyclic) signalling structure
in an acyclic spacetime. Relativistic causality then corresponds to the
compatibility of the two notions of causation. We reformulate the process
matrix framework here and derive a number of no-go results for physical
implementations of process matrices in a spacetime. These reveal that it is
impossible to physically implement indefinite causal order processes with
spacetime localised systems, and also characterise the degree to which they
must be delocalised. Further, we show that any physical implementation of an
indefinite order process can ultimately be fine-grained to one that admits a
fixed acyclic information-theoretic causal order that is compatible with the
spacetime causal order, thus resolving the apparent paradox. Our work sheds
light on the operational meaning of indefinite causal structures which we
discuss in detail.

role in customers' purchasing decisions. As such, retailers must consider the
impact of WoM to manage customer perceptions and future demand. In this paper,
we consider an online shopping system with premium and regular customers.
Building on the behavioral and operations management literature, we model
customer preferences based on the perceived service quality indicated by WoM
and integrate this into the retailer's operational problem to determine a
shipment policy. First, we study the e-tailer's problem when she has no
knowledge of WoM, and only reacts to the changes in demand. We analyze the
long-term behavior of customer demand and show that potential market size and
customer sensitivity are the key parameters determining this behavior. Then, we
build a model to integrate knowledge of WoM into operational decision making
and partially characterize the optimal solution. We show that (i) beating the
competition in the market may not always benefit the company under strict
operational constraints as it can result in undesired customer switching
behavior, (ii) relaxations in operational constraints may hurt profitability
due to the associated difficulties of managing perceptions, and (iii) seeking a
stationary policy can lead to suboptimal solutions, therefore cyclic policies
should also be considered when appropriate.

Such data differs from other data such as land cover data, due to considerable
variations of built-up surface density across the rural-urban continuum
resulting in switches of class imbalance, causing sparsely populated confusion
matrices based on small underlying sample sizes. In this paper, we aim to fill
this gap by testing common agreement measures for their suitability and
plausibility to measure the localized accuracy of built-up surface data. We
examine the sensitivity of localized accuracy to the assessment support, as
well as to the unit of analysis, and analyze the relationships between local
accuracy and density / structure-related properties of built-up areas, across
rural-urban trajectories and over time. Our experiments are based on the
multi-temporal Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and a reference database
for the state of Massachusetts (USA). We find strong variation of suitability
among commonly used agreement measures, and varying levels of sensitivity to
the assessment support. We then apply our framework to assess localized GHSL
data accuracy over time from 1975 to 2014. Besides increasing accuracy along
the rural-urban gradient, we find that accuracy generally increases over time,
mainly driven by peri-urban densification processes in our study area.
Moreover, we find that localized densification measures derived from the GHSL
tend to overestimate peri-urban densification processes that occurred between
1975 and 2014, due to higher levels of omission errors in the GHSL epoch 1975.

primordial ratio (3He/4He)_p=(1.043+/-0.089)x10^-4. Even though the quoted
error does not include the model uncertainty, this determination agrees with
the Standard Model value to within ~2sigma. We also use the present-day

empirical limit on the primordial 3He abundance, (3He/H)_p <

out that it is becoming increasingly difficult to explain the discrepant

electrification and renewable energy deployment in terms of supply costs,
generation and storage capacities, renewable resource mix, and system
operation. Results indicate that equivalent emissions reductions can be
achieved at lower costs to the grid by prioritizing electrification with 40-70%
low-carbon electricity supply instead of aiming for complete grid
decarbonization. With 60% electrification and 50% low-carbon electricity,
approximately 1/3 emissions reductions can be achieved at current supply costs;
with only 20% electrification, 90% low-carbon electricity is required to
achieve the same emissions reductions, resulting in 43% higher grid costs. In
addition, three primary cost drivers are identified for a system undergoing
decarbonization: (1) decreasing per-unit costs of existing infrastructure with

low-carbon sources relative to gas-based and hydropower generation, and (3)
increasing integration costs at high percentages of low-carbon electricity.

determinants of immunological diseases and designing therapeutic remedies.
However, methods of obtaining single-cell TCR sequencing data are labor and

RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). New high-throughput 3' cell-barcoding scRNA-seq
methods can simplify and scale this process; however, they do not routinely
capture TCR sequences during library preparation and sequencing. While 5'
cell-barcoding scRNA-seq methods can be used to examine TCR repertoire at
single-cell resolution, it requires specialized reagents which cannot be
applied to samples previously processed using 3' cell-barcoding methods. Here,
we outline a method for sequencing TCR$\alpha$ and TCR$\beta$ transcripts from
samples already processed using 3' cell-barcoding scRNA-seq platforms, ensuring
TCR recovery at a single-cell resolution. In short, a fraction of the 3'
barcoded whole transcriptome amplification (WTA) product typically used to
generate a massively parallel 3' scRNA-seq library is enriched for TCR
transcripts using biotinylated probes, and further amplified using the same
universal primer sequence from WTA. Primer extension using TCR V-region primers
and targeted PCR amplification results in a 3' barcoded single-cell
CDR3-enriched library that can be sequenced with custom sequencing primers.
Coupled with 3' scRNA-seq of the same WTA, this method enables simultaneous

velocity, i.e. orbital shaking, is of interest in several industrial
applications, e.g. for fermentation processes or in cultivation of stem cells,
where good mixing and efficient gas exchange are the main targets. Under these
external forcing conditions, the free surface typically exhibits a primary
steady state motion through a single-crest dynamics, whose wave amplitude, as a
function of the external forcing parameters, shows a Duffing-like behaviour.
However, previous experiments in lab-scale cylindrical containers have unveiled
that, owing to the excitation of super-harmonics, diverse dynamics are
observable in certain driving-frequency ranges. Among these super-harmonics,
the double-crest dynamics is particularly relevant, as it displays a notably
large amplitude response, that is strongly favored by the spatial structure of
the external forcing. In the inviscid limit and with regards to circular
cylindrical containers, we formalize here a weakly nonlinear analysis via
multiple timescale method of the full hydrodynamic sloshing system, leading to
an amplitude equation suitable to describe such a super-harmonic dynamics and
the resulting single-to-double crest wave transition. The weakly nonlinear
prediction is shown to be in fairly good agreement with previous experiments

detecting and disaggregating the power used by Cumulative Water Heaters (CWH)
in residential homes. Our model circumvents the inherent difficulty of
unsupervised signal disaggregation by using both the shape of a power spike and
its time of occurrence to identify the contribution of CWH reliably. Indeed,
many CHWs in France are configured to turn on automatically during off-peak
hours only, and we are able to use this domain knowledge to aid peak
identification despite the low sampling frequency. In order to test our model,
we equipped a home with sensors to record the ground-truth consumption of a
water heater. We then apply the model to a larger dataset of energy consumption
of Hello Watt users consisting of one month of consumption data for 5k homes at
30-minute resolution. In this dataset we successfully identified CWHs in the
majority of cases where consumers declared using them. The remaining part is
likely due to possible misconfiguration of CWHs, since triggering them during
off-peak hours requires specific wiring in the electrical panel of the house.
Our model, despite its simplicity, offers promising applications: detection of
mis-configured CWHs on off-peak contracts and slow performance degradation.

Then, we model the opinion dynamics on these networks taking the deception into

are invariant to the domain (sensitive attribute) for which labels are
provided, while being informative over all other image attributes, which are
unlabeled. We present a new approach, proposing a new domain-wise contrastive
objective for ensuring invariant representations. This objective crucially
restricts negative image pairs to be drawn from the same domain, which enforces
domain invariance whereas the standard contrastive objective does not. This
domain-wise objective is insufficient on its own as it suffers from shortcut
solutions resulting in feature suppression. We overcome this issue by a
combination of a reconstruction constraint, image augmentations and
initialization with pre-trained weights. Our analysis shows that the choice of
augmentations is important, and that a misguided choice of augmentations can
harm the invariance and informativeness objectives. In an extensive evaluation,
our method convincingly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of
representation invariance, representation informativeness, and training speed.
Furthermore, we find that in some cases our method can achieve excellent
results even without the reconstruction constraint, leading to a much faster

first generation of stars ($N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot})$) and the slope of the
present-day mass function of the clusters ($\alpha_{pd}$), which is
particularly significant for massive clusters. In the framework of the
binary-mediated collision scenario for the formation of the second-generation
stars in globular clusters, we test the effect of a varying stellar initial
mass function (IMF) of the G1 stars on the $(N({\rm G1})/N({\rm

only two input parameters, the shape of the IMF of G1 stars and the fraction of
G1 stars that coalesce to form second-generation stars. We show that a variable
efficiency of the collision process is necessary in order to explain the
$(N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot}))-\alpha_{pd}$ anticorrelation; however, the scatter
in the anticorrelation can only be explained by variations in the IMF, and in
particular by variations in the slope in the mass interval $\approx$ (0.1-0.5)
M$_{\odot}$. Our results indicate that in order to explain the scatter in the
$(N({\rm G1})/N({\rm tot}))-\alpha_{pd}$ relation, it is necessary to invoke
variations in the slope in this mass range between $\approx -0.9$ and $\approx
-1.9$. Interpreted in terms of a Kroupa-like broken power law, this translates
into variations in the mean mass of between $\approx 0.2$ and $0.55$
M$_{\odot}$. This level of variation is consistent with what is observed for
young stellar clusters in the Milky Way and may reflect variations in the
physical conditions of the globular cluster progenitor clouds at the time the
G1 population formed or may indicate the occurrence of collisions between
protostellar embryos before stars settle on the main sequence.

many phenomena. The theory of the renormalization of electronic properties due
to EPIs became well established with the theory of Allen-Heine-Cardona, usually
applied to second order in perturbation theory (P2). However, this is only
valid in the weak coupling regime, while strong EPIs have been reported in many
materials. Although non-perturbative (NP) methods have started to arise in the
last years, they are usually not well justified, and it is not clear to what
degree they reproduce the exact theory. To address this issue, we present a
stochastic approach for the evaluation of the non-perturbative interacting
Green's function in the adiabatic limit, and show it is equivalent to the
Feynman expansion to all orders in the perturbation. Also, by defining a
self-energy, we can reduce the effect of broadening needed in numerical
calculations, improving convergence in the supercell size. In addition, we
clarify whether it is better to average the Green's function or self-energy.
Then we apply the method to a graphene tight-binding model, and obtain several
interesting results: (i) The Debye-Waller term, which is normally neglected,
does affect the change of the Fermi velocity. (ii) The P2 and NP self-energies
differ even at room temperature for some k-points, raising the question of how
well P2 works in other materials. (iii) Close to the Dirac point, positive and
negative energy peaks merge. (iv) In the strong coupling regime, a peak appears
at energy E=0, which is consistent with previous works on disorder and
localization in graphene. (v) The spectral function becomes more asymmetric at
stronger coupling and higher temperatures. Finally, in the Appendix we show
that the method has better convergent properties when the coupling is strong
relative to when it is weak, and discuss other technical aspects.

the present analysis we apply a modified version of this method using data not
only from the minimum year, but also from a couple of years before and after
the minimum. The revised 13-month smoothed monthly total sunspot number data
set from SILSO/SIDC is used. Using data for solar cycle nos. 1-24 the largest
correlation coefficient (CC) is obtained when correlating activity level 3
years before solar cycle minimum with the subsequent maximum (CC = 0.82),
independent of inclusion or exclusion of the solar cycle no. 19. For the next
solar maximum of the cycle no. 25 we predict: Rmax = 121 +- 33. Our results
indicate that the next solar maximum (of the cycle no. 25) will be of the
similar amplitude as the previous one, or even something lower. This is in
accordance with the general middle-term lowering of the solar activity after
the secular maximum in the 20th century and consistent with the Gleissberg
period of the solar activity. The reliability of the 3 years before the minimum
predictor is experimentally justified by the largest correlation coefficient
and verified with the Student t-test. It is satisfactorily explained with the
two empirical well-known findings: the extended solar cycle and the Waldmeier
effect. Finally, we successfully reproduced the maxima of the last four solar

method is that it does not depend on the collection of voice samples to build

general-purpose speaker representations derived from public datasets. Our

and (iii) the process must not only be fast but also memory- and

adaptation techniques have been introduced that improve prediction accuracy of
the models for noisy data by re-tuning the batch normalization (BN) parameters.
This paper, for the first time, performs a comprehensive measurement study of
such techniques to quantify their performance and energy on various edge
devices as well as find bottlenecks and propose optimization opportunities. In
particular, this study considers CIFAR-10-C image classification dataset with

updates the normalization parameters with Wide-ResNet, running on Xavier GPU,
to be overall effective in terms of balancing multiple cost metrics. However,
the adaptation overhead can still be significant (around 213 ms). The results
strongly motivate the need for algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient

dimensional classical and quantum dynamics on lower dimensional geometries.
Synthetic frequency dimensions, in particular, have been used to experimentally
realize a plethora of bulk physics effects, such as effective gauge potentials,
nontrivial Hermitian as well as non-Hermitian topology, spin-momentum locking,
complex long-range coupling, unidirectional frequency conversion, and
four-dimensional lattices. However, in synthetic frequency dimensions there has
not been any demonstration of boundary effects which are of paramount
importance in topological physics due to the bulk edge correspondence, since
systems exhibiting synthetic frequency dimensions do not support well-defined
sharp boundaries. Here we theoretically elucidate a method to construct
boundaries in the synthetic frequency dimension of dynamically modulated ring
resonators by strongly coupling it to an auxiliary ring, and provide an
experimental demonstration of this method. We experimentally explore various
physics effects associated with the creation of such boundaries in the
synthetic frequency dimension, including confinement of the spectrum of light,
the discretization of the band structure, and the interaction of such
boundaries with the topologically protected one-way chiral modes in a quantum
Hall ladder. The incorporation of boundaries allows us to observe topologically
robust transport of light along the frequency axis, which shows that the
frequency of light can be controlled through topological concepts. Our
demonstration of such sharp boundaries fundamentally expands the capability of
exploring topological physics, and is also of importance for other applications
such as classical and quantum information processing in synthetic frequency
dimensions.

of structure in the low-redshift cosmic web. In this analysis, we
cross-correlated the Planck CMB lensing map with voids detected in the Dark
Energy Survey Year 3 (Y3) data set ($\sim$5,000 deg$^{2}$), expanding on
previous measurements that used Y1 catalogues ($\sim$1,300 deg$^{2}$). Given
the increased statistical power compared to Y1 data, we report a $6.6\sigma$
detection of negative CMB convergence ($\kappa$) imprints using approximately
3,600 voids detected from a redMaGiC luminous red galaxy sample. However, the
measured signal is lower than expected from the MICE N-body simulation that is
based on the $\Lambda$CDM model (parameters $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.25$, $\sigma_8
= 0.8$), and the discrepancy is associated mostly with the void centre region.
Considering the full void lensing profile, we fit an amplitude
$A_{\kappa}=\kappa_{\rm DES}/\kappa_{\rm MICE}$ to a simulation-based template
with fixed shape and found a moderate $2\sigma$ deviation in the signal with
$A_{\kappa}\approx0.79\pm0.12$. We also examined the WebSky simulation that is
based on a Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, but the results were even less
consistent given the slightly higher matter density fluctuations than in MICE.
We then identified superclusters in the DES and the MICE catalogues, and
detected their imprints at the $8.4\sigma$ level; again with a
lower-than-expected $A_{\kappa}=0.84\pm0.10$ amplitude. The combination of
voids and superclusters yields a $10.3\sigma$ detection with an
$A_{\kappa}=0.82\pm0.08$ constraint on the CMB lensing amplitude, thus the
overall signal is $2.3\sigma$ weaker than expected from MICE.

learning and autonomy, and such problems commonly face asynchrony in agents'
computations and communications. When delays in these operations are bounded,
they are called partially asynchronous. In this paper, we present an
uncoordinated stepsize selection rule for partially asynchronous block
coordinate descent that only requires local information to implement, and it
leads to faster convergence for a class of nonconvex problems than existing
stepsize rules, which require global information in some form. The problems we
consider satisfy the error bound condition, and the stepsize rule we present
only requires each agent to know (i) a certain type of Lipschitz constant of
its block of the gradient of the objective and (ii) the communication delays
experienced between it and its neighbors. This formulation requires less
information to be available to each agent than existing approaches, typically
allows for agents to use much larger stepsizes, and alleviates the impact of
stragglers while still guaranteeing convergence to a stationary point.
Simulation results provide comparisons and validate the faster convergence
attained by the stepsize rule we develop.

extend beyond the sentence-level. The current performance of discourse models
is very low on texts outside of the training distribution's coverage,
diminishing the practical utility of existing models. There is need for a
measure that can inform us to what extent our model generalizes from the
training to the test sample when these samples may be drawn from distinct
distributions. While this can be estimated via distribution shift, we argue
that this does not directly correlate with change in the observed error of a
classifier (i.e. error-gap). Thus, we propose to use a statistic from the
theoretical domain adaptation literature which can be directly tied to
error-gap. We study the bias of this statistic as an estimator of error-gap
both theoretically and through a large-scale empirical study of over 2400
experiments on 6 discourse datasets from domains including, but not limited to:
news, biomedical texts, TED talks, Reddit posts, and fiction. Our results not
only motivate our proposal and help us to understand its limitations, but also
provide insight on the properties of discourse models and datasets which
improve performance in domain adaptation. For instance, we find that non-news

inform the operator of abnormal situations, particularly in the case of
equipment failures. Due to the interconnections between various parts of the
system, each fault can affect other sections of the system operating normally.
As a result, the fault propagates through faultless devices, increasing the
number of alarms. Hence, the timely detection of the major fault that triggered
the alarm by the operator can prevent the following consequences. However, due
to the complexity of the system, it is often impossible to find precise
relations between the underlying fault and the alarms. As a result, the
operator needs support to make an appropriate decision immediately. Modeling
alarms based on the historical alarm data can assist the operator in
determining the root cause of the alarm. This research aims to model the
relations between industrial alarms using historical alarm data in the
database. Firstly, alarm data is collected, and alarm tags are sequenced. Then,
these sequences are converted to numerical vectors using word embedding. Next,
a self-attention-based BiLSTM-CNN classifier is used to learn the structure and
relevance between historical alarm data. After training the model, this model
is used for online fault detection. Finally, as a case study, the proposed
model is implemented in the well-known Tennessee Eastman process, and the
results are presented.

optimisation problem since weights and features are output by piecewise
constant functions. The standard solution is to apply the straight-through
estimator (STE), using different functions during the inference and gradient
computation steps. Several STE variants have been proposed in the literature
aiming to maximise the task accuracy of the trained network. In this paper, we
analyse STE variants and study their impact on QNN training. We first observe
that most such variants can be modelled as stochastic regularisations of stair
functions; although this intuitive interpretation is not new, our rigorous
discussion generalises to further variants. Then, we analyse QNNs mixing
different regularisations, finding that some suitably synchronised smoothing of
each layer map is required to guarantee pointwise compositional convergence to
the target discontinuous function. Based on these theoretical insights, we
propose additive noise annealing (ANA), a new algorithm to train QNNs
encompassing standard STE and its variants as special cases. When testing ANA
on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark, we find that the major impact
on task accuracy is not due to the qualitative shape of the regularisations but
to the proper synchronisation of the different STE variants used in a network,
in accordance with the theoretical results.

present study conducts a comparison between several structure detection schemes
based on the Okubo-Weiss criterion, the vorticity magnitude, and Lagrangian
coherent structures (LCSs), focusing on the inverse cascade in two-dimensional
hydrodynamic turbulence. A recently introduced vortex scaling phenomenology [B.
H. Burgess, R. K. Scott, J. Fluid Mech., 811:742--756, 2017] allows the
quantification of the respective thresholds required by these methods based on
physical properties of the flow. The resulting improved comparability allows to
identify characteristic relative differences in the detection sensitivity
between the employed structure detection techniques. With respect to the
inverse cascade of energy, coherent structures contribute, as expected,
substantially less to the cross-scale flux than the residual incoherent parts
of the flow although the energetically dominant coherent structures lead to an
important large-scale deformation of the energy spectrum. This cascade
inactivity can be understood by an increased misalignment of strain-rate and
subgrid stress tensors within coherent structures. At the same time, the
structures exhibit strong and localised nonlinear cross-scale interactions that
appear to stabilize them. We quantify and interpret the resulting shape
preservation of coherent structures in terms of a multi-scale gradient approach

in multi- or single-bubble regimes. The sonoluminescence radiation spectrum
analysis attributes a temperature of about 6,000 Kelvin to the bubble (3-5) --
close to the sun's surface temperature. The bubble dynamics, thermodynamics,
and other physicochemical properties are well-explored and studied over the

the underlying physics of sonoluminescence has hitherto remained a puzzle.
Here, we experimentally investigated the photon number statistics of the

distinctly different techniques, i.e., measuring multiphoton correlations and
photon number (using a photon-number resolving detector). Our findings show
that the emitted photons from SBSL possess sub-Poissonian statistics,

sub-Poissonian statistics of emitted photons may help to explain the physics of
SBSL. In addition, considering the importance of nonclassical light sources in
quantum technologies, this discovery would be an exciting milestone in paving
the route towards a bright quantum photonics source.

can be transferred either across different nuclear spin species or from
electron spins to the relatively low-polarized nuclear spins. The former route
occurring in solid-state NMR (ssNMR) can be performed via cross polarization
(CP), while the latter route is known as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).
Despite having different operating conditions, we opinionate that both

electron is merely another spin-1/2 particle with a much higher gyromagnetic
ratio. Here, we show that the CP and DNP processes can be described using a
unified theory based on average Hamiltonian theory (AHT) combined with
fictitious operators. The intuitive and unified approach has allowed new
insights on the cross effect (CE) DNP mechanism, leading to better design of

  and Code Units. A case study on fault localization",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many software engineering techniques, such as fault localization, operate
based on relevance relationships between tests and code. These relationships
are often inferred through the use of dynamic test execution information (test
execution traces) that approximate the link between relevant code units and
asserted, by the tests, program behaviour. Unfortunately, in practice dynamic
information is not always available due to the overheads introduced by the
instrumentation or the nature of the production environments. To deal with this
issue, we propose CEMENT, a static technique that automatically infers such
test and code relationships given the projects' evolution. The key idea is that
developers make relevant changes on test and code units at the same period of
time, i.e., co-evolution of tests and code units reflects a probable link
between them. We evaluate CEMENT on 15 open source projects and show that it
indeed captures relevant links. Additionally, we perform a fault localization
case study where we compare CEMENT with an existing Information Retrieval-based
Fault Localization (IRFL) technique and show that it achieves comparable
performance. A further analysis of our results reveals a small overlap between
the faults successfully localized by the two approaches suggesting
complementarity. In particular, out of the 39 successfully localized faults,
two are common while CEMENT and IRFL localize 16 and 21. These results
demonstrate that test and code evolutionary coupling can effectively support
test and debugging activities.

exponential using an ordinary operator exponential that acts on the Hilbert

It first provides a rigorous way of using discrete time-displacement operators
to generate time-dependent product and multiproduct formulas. Second, it
provides a way to allow qubitization to be employed for certain time-dependent

error in the ordered operator exponential vanishes, as well as the entanglement
between the clock register and the register of the state being acted upon. As
an application, we provide a new family of multiproduct formulas (MPFs) for
time-dependent Hamiltonians that yield both commutator scaling and
poly-logarithmic error scaling. This in turn, means that this method
outperforms existing methods for simulating physically-local, time-dependent
Hamiltonians. Finally, we apply the formalism to show how qubitization can be
generalized to the time-dependent case and show that such a translation can be

  separability","preliminary version, comments are welcome",,,,"cs.LG cond-mat.dis-nn stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Neural networks can implement arbitrary functions. But, mechanistically, what
are the tools at their disposal to construct the target? For classification
tasks, the network must transform the data classes into a linearly separable
representation in the final hidden layer. We show that a feed-forward
architecture has one primary tool at hand to achieve this separability:
progressive folding of the data manifold in unoccupied higher dimensions. The
operation of folding provides a useful intuition in low-dimensions that
generalizes to high ones. We argue that an alternative method based on shear,
requiring very deep architectures, plays only a small role in real-world
networks. The folding operation, however, is powerful as long as layers are
wider than the data dimensionality, allowing efficient solutions by providing
access to arbitrary regions in the distribution, such as data points of one
class forming islands within the other classes. We argue that a link exists
between the universal approximation property in ReLU networks and the
fold-and-cut theorem (Demaine et al., 1998) dealing with physical paper
folding. Based on the mechanistic insight, we predict that the progressive
generation of separability is necessarily accompanied by neurons showing mixed
selectivity and bimodal tuning curves. This is validated in a network trained
on the poker hand task, showing the emergence of bimodal tuning curves during
training. We hope that our intuitive picture of the data transformation in deep
networks can help to provide interpretability, and discuss possible
applications to the theory of convolutional networks, loss landscapes, and
generalization.
  TL;DR: Shows that the internal processing of deep networks can be thought of
as literal folding operations on the data distribution in the N-dimensional
activation space. A link to a well-known theorem in origami theory is provided.

parameters. This generative model is integrated with the governing equations.
In this integration, the derivatives of VAE outputs are readily calculated
using automatic differentiation, and used in the physics-based loss term. In
this work, the loss function is chosen to be the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)
for improved performance, and neural network parameters are updated iteratively
using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We first test the proposed
method on approximating stochastic processes. Then we study three types of
problems related to SDEs: forward and inverse problems together with mixed
problems where system parameters and solutions are simultaneously calculated.
The satisfactory accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are numerically
demonstrated in comparison with physics-informed generative adversarial network

ubiquitous tool for understanding the antibody-mediated immune response: it is
now common to have large volumes of sequence data coding for both the heavy and
light chain subunits of the BCR. However, until the recent development of high
throughput methods of preserving heavy/light chain pairing information, these
samples contained no explicit information on which heavy chain sequence pairs
with which light chain sequence. One of the first steps in analyzing such BCR
repertoire samples is grouping sequences into clonally related families, where
each stems from a single rearrangement event. Many methods of accomplishing
this have been developed, however, none so far has taken full advantage of the
newly-available pairing information. This information can dramatically improve
clustering performance, especially for the light chain. The light chain has
traditionally been challenging for clonal family inference because of its low
diversity and consequent abundance of non-clonal families with
indistinguishable naive rearrangements. Here we present a method of
incorporating this pairing information into the clustering process in order to
arrive at a more accurate partition of the data into clonally related families.
We also demonstrate two methods of fixing imperfect pairing information, which
may allow for simplified sample preparation and increased sequencing depth.

tool in the task-agnostic setting, with applications ranging from skill
discovery to reward shaping. Recently, learning the Laplacian representation
has been framed as the optimization of a temporally-contrastive objective to
overcome its computational limitations in large (or continuous) state spaces.
However, this approach requires uniform access to all states in the state
space, overlooking the exploration problem that emerges during the
representation learning process. In this work, we propose an alternative method
that is able to recover, in a non-uniform-prior setting, the expressiveness and
the desired properties of the Laplacian representation. We do so by combining
the representation learning with a skill-based covering policy, which provides
a better training distribution to extend and refine the representation. We also
show that a simple augmentation of the representation objective with the
learned temporal abstractions improves dynamics-awareness and helps
exploration. We find that our method succeeds as an alternative to the
Laplacian in the non-uniform setting and scales to challenging continuous
control environments. Finally, even if our method is not optimized for skill
discovery, the learned skills can successfully solve difficult continuous
navigation tasks with sparse rewards, where standard skill discovery approaches
are no so effective.

these models are inherently understandable by humans. Recently, several exact
methods for computing such models are proposed to overcome weaknesses of

  Despite their compressed representation of Boolean functions, Binary decision

In this paper, we first propose SAT-based models for learning optimal BDDs (in
terms of the number of features) that classify all input examples. Then, we
lift the encoding to a MaxSAT model to learn optimal BDDs in limited depths,
that maximize the number of examples correctly classified. Finally, we tackle
the fragmentation problem by introducing a method to merge compatible subtrees
for the BDDs found via the MaxSAT model. Our empirical study shows clear

norms at the community level when studying taboo (hateful/offensive/toxic etc.)
language. However, a methodology for doing so, that is firmly founded on
community language norms is still largely absent. This can lead both to biases
in taboo text classification and limitations in our understanding of the causes
of bias. We propose a method to study bias in taboo classification and
annotation where a community perspective is front and center. This is
accomplished by using special classifiers tuned for each community's language.
In essence, these classifiers represent community level language norms. We use
these to study bias and find, for example, biases are largest against African
Americans (7/10 datasets and all 3 classifiers examined). In contrast to
previous papers we also study other communities and find, for example, strong
biases against South Asians. In a small scale user study we illustrate our key
idea which is that common utterances, i.e., those with high alignment scores
with a community (community classifier confidence scores) are unlikely to be
regarded taboo. Annotators who are community members contradict taboo
classification decisions and annotations in a majority of instances. This paper
is a significant step toward reducing false positive taboo decisions that over
time harm minority communities.

that the spacetime geometry affects Maxwell equations inducing an effective
dielectric constant on the space. In its turn, the corrected Coulomb potential
by the gravitational interaction yields a deviation on the $3$-dimensional Bohr
radius. Then, we compute the corrections on the fine structure constant owing
to the GUP in higher-dimensional spacetime. We also found constraints for the
deformation parameter $\beta$ and $D$-dimensional Planck length $l_{D}$ by
comparing the predicted deviations with the recent empirical data of the fine
structure constant. We compute the intermediate length scale, which in
principle may be larger than the Planck length scale. It is conjectured that
below such scale Quantum Gravity effects should take place.

great challenges of nonlinear time series analysis. In this paper, we discuss
this topic with the help of information-theoretic concept known as R\'enyi
information measure. In particular, we tackle the directional information flow
between bivariate time series in terms of R\'enyi transfer entropy. We show
that by choosing R\'enyi $\alpha$ parameter appropriately we can control
information that is transferred only between selected parts of underlying
distributions. This, in turn, provides particularly potent tool for quantifying
causal interdependencies in time series, where the knowledge of ""black swan""
events such as spikes or sudden jumps are of a key importance. In this
connection, we first prove that for Gaussian variables, Granger causality and
R\'enyi transfer entropy are entirely equivalent. Moreover, we also partially
extend this results to heavy-tailed $\alpha$-Gaussian variables. These results
allow to establish connection between autoregressive and R\'enyi entropy based
information-theoretic approaches to data-driven causal inference. To aid our
intuition we employ Leonenko et al. entropy estimator and analyze R\'enyi
information flow between bivariate time series generated from two
unidirectionally coupled R\""ossler systems. Notably, we find that R\'enyi
transfer entropy not only allowed us to detect a threshold of synchronization
but it also provided a non-trivial insight into the structure of a transient
regime that exists between region of chaotic correlations and synchronization
threshold. In addition, from R\'enyi transfer entropy we could reliably infer
the direction of coupling - and hence causality, only for coupling strengths

  Security Data Class Imbalance Issue",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Machine learning techniques have been widely used and demonstrate
promising performance in many software security tasks such as software
vulnerability prediction. However, the class ratio within software
vulnerability datasets is often highly imbalanced (since the percentage of
observed vulnerability is usually very low). Goal: To help security
practitioners address software security data class imbalanced issues and
further help build better prediction models with resampled datasets. Method: We
introduce an approach called Dazzle which is an optimized version of
conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with gradient penalty
(cWGAN-GP). Dazzle explores the architecture hyperparameters of cWGAN-GP with a
novel optimizer called Bayesian Optimization. We use Dazzle to generate
minority class samples to resample the original imbalanced training dataset.
Results: We evaluate Dazzle with three software security datasets, i.e., Moodle
vulnerable files, Ambari bug reports, and JavaScript function code. We show
that Dazzle is practical to use and demonstrates promising improvement over
existing state-of-the-art oversampling techniques such as SMOTE (e.g., with an
average of about 60% improvement rate over SMOTE in recall among all datasets).
Conclusion: Based on this study, we would suggest the use of optimized GANs as
an alternative method for security vulnerability data class imbalanced issues.

prediction, providing an expectation of success. A well-calibrated confidence
estimate enables accurate failure prediction and proper risk measurement when
given noisy samples and out-of-distribution data in real-world settings.
However, this task remains a severe challenge for neural machine translation
(NMT), where probabilities from softmax distribution fail to describe when the
model is probably mistaken. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised
confidence estimate learning jointly with the training of the NMT model. We
explain confidence as how many hints the NMT model needs to make a correct
prediction, and more hints indicate low confidence. Specifically, the NMT model
is given the option to ask for hints to improve translation accuracy at the
cost of some slight penalty. Then, we approximate their level of confidence by
counting the number of hints the model uses. We demonstrate that our learned
confidence estimate achieves high accuracy on extensive sentence/word-level
quality estimation tasks. Analytical results verify that our confidence
estimate can correctly assess underlying risk in two real-world scenarios: (1)
discovering noisy samples and (2) detecting out-of-domain data. We further
propose a novel confidence-based instance-specific label smoothing approach
based on our learned confidence estimate, which outperforms standard label
smoothing.

information processing devices. Even all-optical switchings (AOSs) with
continuous input signals have been widely studied, all-optical pulse switchings
(AOPSs) whose input signals are pulse sequences have rarely been investigated
because of the time-dependent Hamiltonian, especially for dissipative quantum
systems. In this paper, we propose an AOPS scheme, where a strong pulsed field
is used to switch another pulsed input signal. With the help of
Floquet-Lindblad theory, we identify the control field that can effectively
turn on/off the input signal whose amplitude envelope is a square-wave (SW)
pulse train in a three-level dissipative system. By comparing the properties of
the AOPSs controlled by a continuous-wave (CW) field and an SW control field,
we find that the SW field is more suitable to be a practical tool for
controlling the input SW signal. It is interesting to impress that the
switching efficacy is robust against pulse errors. The proposed protocol is
readily implemented in atomic gases or superconducting circuits and corresponds
to AOPSs or all-microwave pulse switchings.

shown to be enhanced by introducing quasi-global searches across energy
barriers, leading to a power-law convergence but with a smaller power than in
the quantum case and thus a slower convergence classically even with
quasi-global search processes. We also reveal how diabatic quantum dynamics,

networks to fit a specific mapping which projects DSR into feature channels

detectors have been developed as forensic countermeasures, these detectors are
still vulnerable to attacks. Recently, a few attacks, principally adversarial
attacks, have succeeded in cloaking DeepFake images to evade detection.
However, these attacks have typical detector-specific designs, which require
prior knowledge about the detector, leading to poor transferability. Moreover,
these attacks only consider simple security scenarios. Less is known about how
effective they are in high-level scenarios where either the detectors or the
attacker's knowledge varies. In this paper, we solve the above challenges with
presenting a novel detector-agnostic trace removal attack for DeepFake
anti-forensics. Instead of investigating the detector side, our attack looks
into the original DeepFake creation pipeline, attempting to remove all
detectable natural DeepFake traces to render the fake images more ""authentic"".
To implement this attack, first, we perform a DeepFake trace discovery,
identifying three discernible traces. Then a trace removal network (TR-Net) is
proposed based on an adversarial learning framework involving one generator and
multiple discriminators. Each discriminator is responsible for one individual
trace representation to avoid cross-trace interference. These discriminators
are arranged in parallel, which prompts the generator to remove various traces
simultaneously. To evaluate the attack efficacy, we crafted heterogeneous
security scenarios where the detectors were embedded with different levels of
defense and the attackers' background knowledge of data varies. The
experimental results show that the proposed attack can significantly compromise
the detection accuracy of six state-of-the-art DeepFake detectors while causing
only a negligible loss in visual quality to the original DeepFake samples.

characterizing key dynamical and statistical features of nature. In this paper,
a systematic multiscale stochastic ROM framework is developed for complex
systems with strong chaotic or turbulent behavior. The new ROMs are
fundamentally different from the traditional Galerkin ROM (G-ROM) or those
deterministic ROMs that aim at minimizing the path-wise errors and applying
mainly to laminar systems. Here, the new ROM focuses on recovering the
large-scale dynamics to the maximum extent while it also exploits cheap but
effective conditional linear functions as the closure terms to capture the
statistical features of the medium-scale variables and its feedback to the
large scales. In addition, physics constraints are incorporated into the new
ROM. One unique feature of the resulting ROM is that it facilitates an
efficient and accurate scheme for nonlinear data assimilation, the solution of
which is provided by closed analytic formulae. Such an analytic solvable data
assimilation solution significantly accelerates the computational efficiency
and allows the new ROM to avoid many potential numerical and sampling issues in
recovering the unobserved states from partial observations. The overall model
calibration is efficient and systematic via explicit mathematical formulae. The
new ROM framework is applied to complex nonlinear systems, in which the
intrinsic turbulent behavior is either triggered by external random forcing or
deterministic nonlinearity. It is shown that the new ROM significantly
outperforms the G-ROM in both scenarios in terms of reproducing the dynamical

associated efficient data assimilation scheme.

researchers wanted to assess the impact of in utero alcohol exposure on child

it is often unclear, a priori, which outcomes are impacted by the exposure
under study. While researchers will generally have some hypotheses about which

exist two main challenges in terms of 1) relevant feature learning for
representation and 2) efficient fusion for multi-modalities. Recently, there
are a number of works have shown the effectiveness in utilizing the attention
mechanism for AU detection, however, most of them are binding the region of
interest (ROI) with features but rarely apply attention between features of
each AU. On the other hand, the transformer, which utilizes a more efficient
self-attention mechanism, has been widely used in natural language processing
and computer vision tasks but is not fully explored in AU detection tasks. In
this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Multi-Head Fused Transformer (MFT)
method for AU detection, which learns AU encoding features representation from
different modalities by transformer encoder and fuses modalities by another
fusion transformer module. Multi-head fusion attention is designed in the
fusion transformer module for the effective fusion of multiple modalities. Our
approach is evaluated on two public multi-modal AU databases, BP4D, and BP4D+,
and the results are superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms and baseline
models. We further analyze the performance of AU detection from different
modalities.

process multiple objects in a single network pass and has a dynamically
scalable architecture for speed-accuracy trade-offs. State-of-the-art methods
prefer to match and segment a single positive object and have to process
objects one by one under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple times of
computation resources. Besides, previous methods always have static network
architectures, which are not flexible enough to adapt to different
speed-accuracy requirements. To solve the above problems, we proposed an
Associating Objects with Scalable Transformers (AOST) approach to match and
segment multiple objects collaboratively with online network scalability. To
match and segment multiple objects as efficiently as processing a single one,
AOST employs an IDentification (ID) mechanism to assign objects with unique
identities and associate them in a shared high-dimensional embedding space. In
addition, a Scalable Long Short-Term Transformer (S-LSTT) is designed to
construct hierarchical multi-object associations and enable online adaptation
of accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. By further introducing scalable supervision
and layer-wise ID-based attention, AOST is not only more flexible but more
robust than previous methods. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-object
and single-object benchmarks to evaluate AOST variants. Compared to
state-of-the-art competitors, our methods can maintain superior run-time
efficiency with better performance. Notably, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on popular VOS benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (86.5%), DAVIS 2017

use of the OntoLex-Lemon for storing the lexical data and Ligt for storing the
interlinear glossed text and then internally linking it to the other linked

the root-aligned SMILES (R-SMILES), which specifies a tightly aligned

galactic properties for the Milky Way-like host galaxies in order to better
understand their diverse satellite populations. We specifically aim to
understand why galaxies that are very similar in stellar mass content, star
formation rate, and local environment have very different numbers of
satellites. Satellites of Galactic Analogs (SAGA) spectroscopic survey has
completed spectroscopic observations of 36 Milky Way-like galaxies within their
virial radii down to the luminosity of Leo I dwarf galaxy. All the available
galactic properties of SAGA galaxies from the literature along with measured
stellar masses were correlated with the number of satellites and no significant
correlation was found. However, when we considered the ""expected"" number of
satellites based on the correlation between the baryonic bulge-to-total ratio
and the number of satellites confirmed for several nearby galaxies then strong
correlations emerge between this number and (1) the mass of the bulge, and (2)
the total specific angular momentum. The first correlation is positive,
implying that galaxies with more massive bulges have more satellites, as
already confirmed. The second correlation with the angular momentum is
negative, meaning that, the smaller the angular momentum, the greater the
number of expected satellites. This would imply that either satellites cannot
form if galaxy angular momentum is too high, or that satellites form
inside-out, so that angular momentum is being transferred to the outer parts of
the galaxies. However, deeper spectroscopic observations are needed to confirm
these findings, because they rely on the expected rather than detected number
of satellites. There was a luminosity limit to the SAGA survey equivalent to
the luminosity of Leo I dwarf satellite of the Milky Way galaxy.

qubit-frequency crowding or errors due to crosstalk between qubits. We thus
propose a design for this kind of tunable coupler, which we call a

coupled through a common loop with an additional Josephson junction.
Controlling the magnetic flux in the loop, we can achieve not only fast
high-fidelity two-qubit gates, but also no residual coupling during idle time,
where computational qubits are highly detuned fixed-frequency transmons. The
proposed coupler is expected to offer an alternative approach to

this architecture, we adopt a message broadcasting mechanism to integrate the
hierarchical representations learned from the global-level affinity graph and
the local-level molecular graph. Besides, we design a similarity-based

unseen drugs and targets. Comprehensive experimental results under different

applications. In the context of large-scale multiple testing, the goal is to
extract and transfer knowledge learned from related source domains to improve
the accuracy of simultaneously testing of a large number of hypotheses in the
target domain. This article develops a locally adaptive transfer learning
algorithm (LATLA) for transfer learning for multiple testing. In contrast with
existing covariate-assisted multiple testing methods that require the auxiliary
covariates to be collected alongside the primary data on the same testing
units, LATLA provides a principled and generic transfer learning framework that
is capable of incorporating multiple samples of auxiliary data from related
source domains, possibly in different dimensions/structures and from diverse
populations. Both the theoretical and numerical results show that LATLA
controls the false discovery rate and outperforms existing methods in power.
LATLA is illustrated through an application to genome-wide association studies
for the identification of disease-associated SNPs by cross-utilizing the
auxiliary data from a related linkage analysis.

Median luminosity divides any given population into equal halves. When the
functional form of a distribution is unknown, it can be a more robust
diagnostic than any that use trial functional forms. In this work we employ a
statistical test based on median luminosity and apply it to test a class of
models for GRBs. We assume that the GRB jet has a finite opening angle and that
the orientation of the GRB jet is random relative to the observer.We calculate
$L_{median}$ as a function of redshift by simulating GRBs empirically,

compare the theoretical results with the observed ones.
  The method accounts for the fact that at some redshifts there may be some

the majority of variability seen at megahertz frequencies is due to refractive

resulting from competing and intertwined phases with nearly degenerate ground

density wave (CDW) is ordered well above and strongly coupled to the magnetic
order to form spin-charge separated stripes that compete with
superconductivity. Recently, such rich phase diagrams have also been revealed
in correlated topological materials. In two-dimensional kagome lattice metals
consisting of corner-sharing triangles, the geometry of the lattice can produce
flat bands with localized electrons, non-trivial topology, chiral magnetic
order, superconductivity and CDW order. While CDW has been found in weakly
electron correlated nonmagnetic AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs), it has not yet been
observed in correlated magnetic ordered kagome lattice metals. Here we report
the discovery of CDW within the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered phase of kagome
lattice FeGe. The CDW in FeGe occurs at wavevectors identical to that of
AV3Sb5, enhances the AFM ordered moment, and induces an emergent anomalous Hall
effect. Our findings suggest that CDW in FeGe arises from the combination of
electron correlations-driven AFM order and van Hove singularities-driven
instability possibly associated with a chiral flux phase, in stark contrast to
strongly correlated copper oxides and nickelates, where the CDW precedes or
accompanies the magnetic order.

collaborative training on decentralized clients. However, most existing methods
unrealistically assume object classes of the overall framework are fixed over

on old classes in real-world scenarios, where local clients often collect new
classes continuously and have very limited storage memory to store old classes.
Moreover, new clients with unseen new classes may participate in the FL
training, further aggravating the catastrophic forgetting of the global model.
To address these challenges, we develop a novel Global-Local Forgetting
Compensation (GLFC) model, to learn a global class incremental model for
alleviating the catastrophic forgetting from both local and global
perspectives. Specifically, to address local forgetting caused by class
imbalance at the local clients, we design a class-aware gradient compensation
loss and a class-semantic relation distillation loss to balance the forgetting
of old classes and distill consistent inter-class relations across tasks. To
tackle the global forgetting brought by the non-i.i.d class imbalance across
clients, we propose a proxy server that selects the best old global model to
assist the local relation distillation. Moreover, a prototype gradient-based
communication mechanism is developed to protect privacy. Our model outperforms

parameter-based approach, which encodes all the seen past-future instance pairs

seen instances, which means a huge amount of irrelevant seen instances might
also involve in predicting the current situation, disturbing the performance.
To provide a more explicit link between the current situation and the seen
instances, we imitate the mechanism of retrospective memory in neuropsychology
and propose MemoNet, an instance-based approach that predicts the movement
intentions of agents by looking for similar scenarios in the training data. In
MemoNet, we design a pair of memory banks to explicitly store representative
instances in the training set, acting as prefrontal cortex in the neural
system, and a trainable memory addresser to adaptively search a current
situation with similar instances in the memory bank, acting like basal ganglia.
During prediction, MemoNet recalls previous memory by using the memory
addresser to index related instances in the memory bank. We further propose a
two-step trajectory prediction system, where the first step is to leverage
MemoNet to predict the destination and the second step is to fulfill the whole
trajectory according to the predicted destinations. Experiments show that the
proposed MemoNet improves the FDE by 20.3%/10.2%/28.3% from the previous best

production and perception principles of speech. We introduce, to our knowledge,
the most challenging objective in unsupervised lexical learning: a network that
must learn unique representations for lexical items with no direct access to

test how the networks classify acoustic lexical items in unobserved test data.
Strong evidence in favor of lexical learning and a causal relationship between
latent codes and meaningful sublexical units emerge. The architecture that
combines the production and perception principles is thus able to learn to
decode unique information from raw acoustic data without accessing real
training data directly. We propose a technique to explore lexical (holistic)
and sublexical (featural) learned representations in the classifier network.
The results bear implications for unsupervised speech technology, as well as
for unsupervised semantic modeling as language models increasingly bypass text

a uniform transformers stack architecture and large amounts of image-text
paired data, achieving remarkable results on downstream tasks such as
image-text reference(IR and TR), vision question answering (VQA) and image

combination of multiple public datasets to meet the demand of large-scare
training data. However, due to the unevenness of data distribution including
size, task type and quality, using the mixture of multiple datasets for model
training can be problematic. In this work, we introduce a large-scale
multi-modal corpora named WuDaoMM, totally containing more than 650M image-text
pairs. Specifically, about 600 million pairs of data are collected from
multiple webpages in which image and caption present weak correlation, and the
other 50 million strong-related image-text pairs are collected from some
high-quality graphic websites. We also release a base version of WuDaoMM with 5
million strong-correlated image-text pairs, which is sufficient to support the
common cross-modal model pre-training. Besides, we trained both an
understanding and a generation vision-language (VL) model to test the dataset
effectiveness. The results show that WuDaoMM can be applied as an efficient
dataset for VLPMs, especially for the model in text-to-image generation task.

years, computer-aided diagnosis has been rapidly developed and make great
progress in healthcare and medical practices due to the advances in artificial
intelligence. However, most studies in skin cancer detection keep pursuing high
prediction accuracies without considering the limitation of computing resources
on portable devices. In this case, knowledge distillation (KD) has been proven
as an efficient tool to help improve the adaptability of lightweight models
under limited resources, meanwhile keeping a high-level representation
capability. To bridge the gap, this study specifically proposes a novel method,
termed SSD-KD, that unifies diverse knowledge into a generic KD framework for
skin diseases classification. Our method models an intra-instance relational
feature representation and integrates it with existing KD research. A dual
relational knowledge distillation architecture is self-supervisedly trained
while the weighted softened outputs are also exploited to enable the student
model to capture richer knowledge from the teacher model. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on ISIC 2019, a large-scale
open-accessed benchmark of skin diseases dermoscopic images. Experiments show
that our distilled lightweight model can achieve an accuracy as high as 85% for
the classification tasks of 8 different skin diseases with minimal parameters
and computing requirements. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our
intra- and inter-instance relational knowledge integration strategy. Compared
with state-of-the-art knowledge distillation techniques, the proposed method
demonstrates improved performances for multi-diseases classification on the

and SeqTrain module. Firstly, Group module partitions users into balanced
groups based on their similarity of collaborative embedding learned via
hypergraph. Then SeqTrain module trains the model sequentially on all groups

discover that the effect of the high-order graph structure is a smoother filter

objects contained in the video frames using deep learning models like YOLOV3,
EfficientDet. However, running these detectors on each and every frame in
resource-constrained edge devices is computationally intensive. By taking the
temporal correlation between consecutive video frames into account, we note
that detection outputs tend to be overlapping in successive frames. Elimination
of similar consecutive frames will lead to a negligible drop in performance
while offering significant performance benefits by reducing overall computation
and communication costs. The key technical questions are, therefore, (a) how to
identify which frames to be processed by the object detector, and (b) how many
successive frames can be skipped (called skip-length) once a frame is selected
to be processed. The overall goal of the process is to keep the error due to
skipping frames as small as possible. We introduce a novel error vs processing
rate optimization problem with respect to the object detection task that
balances between the error rate and the fraction of frames filtering.
Subsequently, we propose an off-line Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based
algorithm to determine these skip-lengths as a state-action policy of the RL
agent from a recorded video and then deploy the agent online for live video
streams. To this end, we develop FrameHopper, an edge-cloud collaborative video
analytics framework, that runs a lightweight trained RL agent on the camera and
passes filtered frames to the server where the object detection model runs for
a set of applications. We have tested our approach on a number of live videos
captured from real-life scenarios and show that FrameHopper processes only a
handful of frames but produces detection results closer to the oracle solution
and outperforms recent state-of-the-art solutions in most cases.

field after its reversal. We find that the rise rate of the polar field is
highly correlated with the rise rate and the amplitude of the next solar cycle.
Thus, the prediction of the amplitude of the solar cycle can be made just a few
years after the reversal of the previous cycle's polar field, thereby extending
the scope of the solar cycle prediction to much earlier than the usual time.
Our prediction of Cycle 25 based on the rise rate of the previous polar field

field, the robustness against inferior image conditions, e.g., bad illumination
and sensor misalignment, is under-explored. Existing fusion methods are easily
affected by such conditions, mainly due to a hard association of LiDAR points
and image pixels, established by calibration matrices. We propose TransFusion,
a robust solution to LiDAR-camera fusion with a soft-association mechanism to
handle inferior image conditions. Specifically, our TransFusion consists of
convolutional backbones and a detection head based on a transformer decoder.
The first layer of the decoder predicts initial bounding boxes from a LiDAR
point cloud using a sparse set of object queries, and its second decoder layer
adaptively fuses the object queries with useful image features, leveraging both
spatial and contextual relationships. The attention mechanism of the
transformer enables our model to adaptively determine where and what
information should be taken from the image, leading to a robust and effective
fusion strategy. We additionally design an image-guided query initialization
strategy to deal with objects that are difficult to detect in point clouds.
TransFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. We
provide extensive experiments to demonstrate its robustness against degenerated
image quality and calibration errors. We also extend the proposed method to the

this work, we explore light surfaces and find new effects of repulsive gravity.
We compare Kerr naked singularities with the corresponding black hole

remnants. We argue that these features might be significant for the
comprehension of processes that lead to the formation or eventually destruction
of black hole Killing horizons. These features can be detected by observing
photon orbits, particularly close to the rotation axis, which can be used to
distinguish naked singularities from black hole.

assessment(NI-SQA) based on the residuals between impaired speech and enhanced
speech. The difficulty in our task is particularly lack of information, for
which the corresponding reference speech is absent. We generate an enhanced
speech on the impaired speech to compensate for the absence of the reference
audio, then pair the information of residuals with the impaired speech.
Compared to feeding the impaired speech directly into the model, residuals
could bring some extra helpful information from the contrast in enhancement.
The human ear is sensitive to certain noises but different to deep learning
model. Causing the Mean Opinion Score(MOS) the model predicted is not enough to
fit our subjective sensitive well and causes deviation. These residuals have a
close relationship to reference speech and then improve the ability of the deep
learning models to predict MOS. During the training phase, experimental results
demonstrate that paired with residuals can quickly obtain better evaluation
indicators under the same conditions. Furthermore, our final results improved
31.3 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively, in PLCC and RMSE.

noisy input. In real-world speech communication, however, noises often exist in
not only speaker but also listener environments. Although SE methods can
suppress the noise contained in the speaker's voice, they cannot deal with the
noise that is physically present in the listener side. To address such a
complicated but common scenario, we investigate a deep learning-based joint
framework integrating noise reduction (NR) with listening enhancement (LE), in
which the NR module first suppresses noise and the LE module then modifies the
denoised speech, i.e., the output of the NR module, to further improve speech
intelligibility. The enhanced speech can thus be less noisy and more
intelligible for listeners. Experimental results show that our proposed method
achieves promising results and significantly outperforms the disjoint

dust emission self-consistently to compare quantitatively with observational

reproduces successfully the complete data set used. For the best-fitting model,
the energy density of the magnetic field dominates over the particle energy
density up to a distance of $\approx 1.3~r_s$ ($r_s$: distance of the
termination shock from the pulsar). The very high energy (VHE: $E>100$ GeV)
gamma-ray spectra set the strongest constraints on the radial dependence of the
magnetic field: $B(r)=(264\pm9)~\mu\mathrm{G} (r/r_s)^{-0.51\pm0.03}$. The
reconstructed magnetic field and its radial dependence indicates a ratio of
Poynting to kinetic energy flux $\sigma\approx 0.1$ at the termination shock,
$\approx 30$ times larger than estimated up to now. Consequently, the
confinement of the nebula would require additional mechanisms to slow down the
flow through e.g. excitation of small-scale turbulence with possible

detect the corrections beyond the Nambu-Goto approximation in the EST. We
discuss in detail this issue in the case of the deconfinement transition of the
SU(2) gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions (which belongs to the same
universality class of the 2d Ising model) by means of an extensive set of high
precision simulations. We show that the Polyakov loops correlator of the SU(2)

not only at the critical point, but also down to temperatures of the order of

the comparison in the whole range of Polyakov loop separations, even beyond the
conformal perturbation regime. We use these results to quantify the first EST
correction beyond Nambu-Goto and show that it is compatible with the bounds
imposed by a bootstrap analysis of EST. This correction encodes important

Given the promising performance of contrastive learning, we propose Rebalanced
Siamese Contrastive Mining (ResCom) to tackle imbalanced recognition. Based on
the mathematical analysis and simulation results, we claim that supervised
contrastive learning suffers a dual class-imbalance problem at both the
original batch and Siamese batch levels, which is more serious than long-tailed
classification learning. In this paper, at the original batch level, we
introduce a class-balanced supervised contrastive loss to assign adaptive
weights for different classes. At the Siamese batch level, we present a
class-balanced queue, which maintains the same number of keys for all classes.
Furthermore, we note that the imbalanced contrastive loss gradient with respect
to the contrastive logits can be decoupled into the positives and negatives,
and easy positives and easy negatives will make the contrastive gradient
vanish. We propose supervised hard positive and negative pairs mining to pick
up informative pairs for contrastive computation and improve representation
learning. Finally, to approximately maximize the mutual information between the
two views, we propose Siamese Balanced Softmax and joint it with the
contrastive loss for one-stage training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ResCom outperforms the previous methods by large margins on multiple
long-tailed recognition benchmarks. Our code and models are made publicly

methods with heat treatment at 400 C for 4 h. A conventional sol gel process
produced well-crystallized anatase, while Pechini synthesis yielded less
ordered mixed-phase anatase and rutile; this suggests that the latter method
enhances Ce solubility and increases chemical homogeneity but destabilizes the
TiO2 lattice. Greater structural disruption from the decomposition of the
Pechini precursor formed more open agglomerated morphologies, while the lower
levels of structural disruption from pyrolysis of the dried sol gel precursor
resulted in denser agglomerates of lower surface areas. Codoping and associated
destabilization of the lattice reduced the binding energies in both powders.
Cr4+ formation in sol gel powders and Cr6+ formation in Pechini powders suggest
that these valence changes derive from synergistic electron exchange from
intervalence and/or multivalence charge transfer. Since Ce is too large to
allow either substitutional or interstitial solid solubility, the concept of
integrated solubility is introduced, in which the Ti site and an adjacent
interstice are occupied by the large Ce ion. The photocatalytic performance
data show that codoping was detrimental owing to the effects of reduced
crystallinity from lattice destabilization and surface area. Two regimes of
mechanistic behavior are seen, which are attributed to the unsaturated solid
solutions at lower codopant levels and supersaturated solid solutions at higher
levels. The present work demonstrates that the Pechini method offers a
processing technique that is superior to sol gel because the former facilitates
solid solubility and consequent chemical homogeneity.

decomposing the rainy image into two distinguishable layers: the clean image
layer and the rain layer. Most of the existing learning-based deraining methods
are supervisedly trained on synthetic rainy-clean pairs. The domain gap between
the synthetic and real rains makes them less generalized to different real
rainy scenes. Moreover, the existing methods mainly utilize the property of the
two layers independently, while few of them have considered the mutually
exclusive relationship between the two layers. In this work, we propose a novel
non-local contrastive learning (NLCL) method for unsupervised image deraining.
Consequently, we not only utilize the intrinsic self-similarity property within
samples but also the mutually exclusive property between the two layers, so as
to better differ the rain layer from the clean image. Specifically, the
non-local self-similarity image layer patches as the positives are pulled
together and similar rain layer patches as the negatives are pushed away. Thus
the similar positive/negative samples that are close in the original space
benefit us to enrich more discriminative representation. Apart from the
self-similarity sampling strategy, we analyze how to choose an appropriate
feature encoder in NLCL. Extensive experiments on different real rainy datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance in
real deraining.

characterized by a real frequency and a real Bloch wavevector for which there
exist waves propagating to or from infinity in the surrounding media. For
applications, it is important to analyze the high-$Q$ resonances that either
exist naturally for wavevectors near that of the BIC or appear when the
structure is perturbed. Existing theories provide quantitative results for the
complex frequency (and the $Q$-factor) of resonant modes that appear/exist due
to structural perturbations or wavevector variations. When a periodic structure
is regarded as a periodic waveguide, eigenmodes are often analyzed for a given
real frequency. In this paper, we consider periodic waveguides with a BIC, and
study the eigenmodes for given real frequencies near the frequency of the BIC.
It turns out that such eigenmodes near the BIC always have a complex Bloch
wavenumber, but they may or may not be leaky modes that radiate out power
laterally to infinity. These eigenmodes can also be complex modes that decay
exponentially in the lateral direction. Our study is relevant for applications
of BICs in optical waveguides, and it is also helpful for analyzing photonic
devices operating near the frequency of a BIC.

expressive than CCS$\gamma$, a variant of CCS in which the result of a
synchronisation of two actions is itself an action subject to relabelling or
restriction, rather than the silent action $\tau$. This is done by exhibiting a
compositional translation from the $\pi$-calculus with implicit matching to
CCS$\gamma$ that is valid up to strong barbed bisimilarity. The full
$\pi$-calculus can be similarly expressed in CCS$\gamma$ enriched with the
triggering operation of Meije. I also show that these results cannot be
recreated with CCS in the role of CCS$\gamma$, not even up to reduction
equivalence, and not even for the asynchronous $\pi$-calculus without
restriction or replication. Finally I observe that CCS cannot be encoded in the

attacked. The smart contracts building decentralized finance (DeFi) have
introduced a new transaction ordering dependency to the Ethereum blockchain. As
a result, attackers can profit from front- and back-running transactions.
Multiple approaches to mitigate transaction reordering manipulations have
surfaced recently. However, the success of individual approaches in mitigating
such attacks and their impact on the entire blockchain remains largely
unstudied.
  In this systematization of knowledge (SoK), we categorize and analyze
state-of-the-art transaction reordering manipulation mitigation schemes.
Instead of restricting our analysis to a scheme's success at preventing
transaction reordering attacks, we evaluate its full impact on the blockchain.
Therefore, we are able to provide a complete picture of the strengths and
weaknesses of current mitigation schemes. We find that currently no scheme
fully meets all the demands of the blockchain ecosystem. In fact, all
approaches demonstrate unsatisfactory performance in at least one area relevant
to the blockchain ecosystem.

  Passive Communication",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How to efficiently and reliably spread information in a system is one of the
most fundamental problems in distributed computing. Recently, inspired by
biological scenarios, several works focused on identifying the minimal
communication resources necessary to spread information under faulty
conditions. Here we study the self-stabilizing bit-dissemination problem,
introduced by Boczkowski, Korman, and Natale in [SODA 2017]. The problem
considers a fully-connected network of n agents, with a binary world of
opinions, one of which is called correct. At any given time, each agent holds
an opinion bit as its public output. The population contains a source agent
which knows which opinion is correct. This agent adopts the correct opinion and
remains with it throughout the execution. We consider the basic PULL model of
communication, in which each agent observes relatively few randomly chosen
agents in each round. The goal of the non-source agents is to quickly converge
on the correct opinion, despite having an arbitrary initial configuration,
i.e., in a self-stabilizing manner. Once the population converges on the
correct opinion, it should remain with it forever. Motivated by biological
scenarios in which animals observe and react to the behavior of others, we
focus on the extremely constrained model of passive communication, which
assumes that when observing another agent the only information that can be
extracted is the opinion bit of that agent. We prove that this problem can be
solved in a poly-logarithmic in n number of rounds with high probability, while
sampling a logarithmic number of agents at each round. Previous works solved
this problem faster and using fewer samples, but they did that by decoupling
the messages sent by agents from their output opinion, and hence do not fit the
framework of passive communication. Moreover, these works use complex recursive
algorithms with refined clocks that are unlikely to be used by biological
entities. In contrast, our proposed algorithm has a natural appeal as it is
based on letting agents estimate the current tendency direction of the
dynamics, and then adapt to the emerging trend.

  Continuous Action Tasks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2105.00704",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Double Q-learning is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm in Markov
decision process (MDP) problems. Clipped Double Q-learning, as an effective
variant of Double Q-learning, employs the clipped double estimator to
approximate the maximum expected action value. Due to the underestimation bias
of the clipped double estimator, the performance of clipped Double Q-learning
may be degraded in some stochastic environments. In this paper, in order to
reduce the underestimation bias, we propose an action candidate-based clipped
double estimator for Double Q-learning. Specifically, we first select a set of
elite action candidates with high action values from one set of estimators.
Then, among these candidates, we choose the highest valued action from the
other set of estimators. Finally, we use the maximum value in the second set of
estimators to clip the action value of the chosen action in the first set of
estimators and the clipped value is used for approximating the maximum expected
action value. Theoretically, the underestimation bias in our clipped Double
Q-learning decays monotonically as the number of action candidates decreases.
Moreover, the number of action candidates controls the trade-off between the
overestimation and underestimation biases. In addition, we also extend our
clipped Double Q-learning to continuous action tasks via approximating the
elite continuous action candidates. We empirically verify that our algorithm
can more accurately estimate the maximum expected action value on some toy
environments and yield good performance on several benchmark problems.

Previous works suggest that such

condensates, the nature of the transition between the quasiclassical dynamics
at large scales and the corresponding dynamics at small scales, where the
quantization of vorticity is essential, remains an outstanding unresolved
question. Here we expand the paradigm of wave-driven turbulence to rotating
quantum fluids where the spectrum of waves extends to microscopic scales as
Kelvin waves on quantized vortices. We excite inertial waves at the largest
scale by periodic modulation of the angular velocity and observe
dissipation-independent transfer of energy to smaller scales and the eventual
onset of the elusive Kelvin-wave cascade at the lowest temperatures. We further
find that energy is pumped to the system through a boundary layer distinct from
the classical Ekman layer and support our observations with numerical
simulations. Our experiments demonstrate a new regime of turbulent motion in
quantum fluids where the role of vortex reconnections can be neglected, thus
stripping the transition between the classical and the quantum regimes of
turbulence down to its bare bones.

that performs well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently, causality has
become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea
resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest.
To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a
linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training
domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate
these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the
causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the
non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either
obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the
multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we
theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can
learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data.
Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations
may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of
these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized
training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability.
Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, even with only a few causal invariant
transformations.

coverage in evolutionary status makes it possible to define abundance trends
respectively for giants and turn-off stars. The newly obtained abundance data
confirm most abundance trends found by previous studies, but also provide
useful update and new sample of outliers. The Li plateau is seen in -2.5 <
[Fe/H] <-1.7 in our sample, whereas the average Li abundance is clearly lower
at lower metallicity. Mg, Si, and Ca are overabundant with respect to Fe,
showing decreasing trend with increasing metallicity. Comparisons with chemical

Lindblad equations can be solved analytically for systems with quadratic
Hamiltonians and linear Lindbladians, showing the familiar phenomena of
dissipation and decoherence. It is well known that the Lindblad dynamics can be
expressed as an ensemble average over stochastic pure-state dynamics, which can
be interpreted as individual experimental implementations, where the form of
the stochastic dynamics depends on the measurement setup. Here we consider
quantum-jump and stochastic Schr\""odinger dynamics for initially Gaussian
states. While both unravellings converge to the same Lindblad dynamics when
averaged, the individual dynamics can differ qualitatively. For the stochastic
Schr\""odinger equation, Gaussian states remain Gaussian during the evolution,
with stochastic differential equations governing the evolution of the
phase-space centre and a deterministic evolution of the covariance matrix. In
contrast to this, individual pure-state dynamics arising from the quantum-jump
evolution do not remain Gaussian in general. Applying results developed in the
non-Hermitian context for Hagedorn wavepackets, we formulate a method to
generate quantum-jump trajectories that is described entirely in terms of the
evolution of an underlying Gaussian state. To illustrate the behaviours of the
different unravellings in comparison to the Lindblad dynamics, we consider two
examples in detail, which can be largely treated analytically, a harmonic
oscillator subject to position measurement and a damped harmonic oscillator. In
both cases, we highlight the differences as well as the similarities of the
stochastic Schr\""odinger and the quantum-jump dynamics.

Boundary Element Method (BEM) on smooth curved 3D geometries, an analytical
singularity extraction technique is employed. By adopting the isoparametric
approach, curved geometries that are represented by mapped rectangles or
triangles from the parametric domain are considered. The singularity extraction
on the governing singular integrals can be performed either as an operation of
subtraction or division, each having some advantages. A particular series
expansion of a singular kernel about a source point is investigated. The series
in the intrinsic coordinates consists of functions of a type $R^p x^q y^r$,
where $R$ is a square root of a quadratic bivariate homogeneous polynomial,
corresponding to the first fundamental form of a smooth surface, and $p,q,r$
are integers, satisfying $p\leq -1$ and $q,r \geq 0$. By extracting more terms
from the series expansion of the singular kernel, the smoothness of the
regularized kernel at the source point can be increased. Analytical formulae
for integrals of such terms are obtained from antiderivatives of $R^p x^q y^r$,
using recurrence formulae, and by evaluating them at the edges of rectangular
or triangular parametric domains. Numerical tests demonstrate that the
singularity extraction technique can be a useful prerequisite for a numerical
quadrature scheme to obtain accurate evaluations of the governing singular

approach introduces a Euclidean symmetric neural network (ESNN) architecture

learn the 2D latent dynamics from the motion trajectory of a reduced-order

architecture that simultaneously preserves energy invariance and force
equivariance under Euclidean transformations of the input, including
translation, rotation, and reflection. The embedded Euclidean symmetry provides
physics-guided interpretability and generalizability, while preserving the full
expressive power of the neural network. We demonstrate that the ESNN approach
is able to accelerate simulation by one to two orders of magnitude compared to
traditional numerical methods and achieve a superior generalization performance
while classic neural networks fail to learn the Slinky dynamics, i.e., the
ESNN, trained on a single demonstration case, predicts the motions accurately

Further investigation into the ESNN reveals that it explicitly learns the

daily lives and it has become normal for people to have AI make decisions for
them. Reinforcement learning (RL) models increase the space of solvable
problems with respect to other machine learning paradigms. Some of the most
interesting applications are in situations with non-differentiable expected
reward function, operating in unknown or underdefined environment, as well as
for algorithmic discovery that surpasses performance of any teacher, whereby
agent learns from experimental experience through simple feedback. The range of
applications and their social impact is vast, just to name a few: genomics,
game-playing (chess, Go, etc.), general optimization, financial investment,
governmental policies, self-driving cars, recommendation systems, etc. It is
therefore essential to improve the trust and transparency of RL-based systems
through explanations. Most articles dealing with explainability in artificial
intelligence provide methods that concern supervised learning and there are
very few articles dealing with this in the area of RL. The reasons for this are
the credit assignment problem, delayed rewards, and the inability to assume
that data is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This position
paper attempts to give a systematic overview of existing methods in the
explainable RL area and propose a novel unified taxonomy, building and
expanding on the existing ones. The position section describes pragmatic
aspects of how explainability can be observed. The gap between the parties
receiving and generating the explanation is especially emphasized. To reduce
the gap and achieve honesty and truthfulness of explanations, we set up three
pillars: proactivity, risk attitudes, and epistemological constraints. To this
end, we illustrate our proposal on simple variants of the shortest path

running time analysis of the standard NSGA-II for solving LOTZ, OneMinMax and

we prove that the expected running time (i.e., number of fitness evaluations)
is $O(n^3)$ for LOTZ, and $O(n^2\log n)$ for OneMinMax and COCZ, which is
surprisingly as same as that of the previously analyzed simple MOEAs, GSEMO and

selection (i.e., $k$ tournament selection where $k$ is uniformly sampled at
random), to replace the binary tournament selection strategy of NSGA-II,
decreasing the required expected running time to $O(n^2)$ for all the three

Feynman integrals can be uniquely defined in dimensional regularization scheme.
By an asymptotic expansion in the hard momenta, the computation of local and
sub-divergences is reduced to the computation of local divergences of massless
vacuum integrals. In theories with spin $\le\frac{1}{2}$, the beta functions
and anomalous dimensions can be extracted directly from the local divergence of

  We also propose two methods to reduce the tensor structures which can be used
in the computation of local divergence. The first method is based on

science and imaging. They are often formulated as non-smooth minimisation
problems. In sparse inversion, we minimise, e.g., the sum of a data fidelity
term and an L1/LASSO regulariser. In classification, we consider, e.g., the sum
of a data fidelity term and a non-smooth Ginzburg--Landau energy. Standard
(sub)gradient descent methods have shown to be inefficient when approaching
such problems. Splitting techniques are much more useful: here, the target
function is partitioned into a sum of two subtarget functions -- each of which
can be efficiently optimised. Splitting proceeds by performing optimisation
steps alternately with respect to each of the two subtarget functions.
  In this work, we study splitting from a stochastic continuous-time
perspective. Indeed, we define a differential inclusion that follows one of the
two subtarget function's negative subdifferential at each point in time. The
choice of the subtarget function is controlled by a binary continuous-time
Markov process. The resulting dynamical system is a stochastic approximation of
the underlying subgradient flow. We investigate this stochastic approximation
for an L1-regularised sparse inversion flow and for a discrete Allen-Cahn
equation minimising a Ginzburg--Landau energy. In both cases, we study the
longtime behaviour of the stochastic dynamical system and its ability to
approximate the underlying subgradient flow at any accuracy. We illustrate our
theoretical findings in a simple sparse estimation problem and also in low- and
high-dimensional classification problems.

anisotropy splitting ($\Delta\rho_{AMR}$) and the anisotropic magnetoresistance

view groups, three levels of diversity (w.r.t. features, anchors, and
neighbors, respectively) are jointly leveraged for constructing the
view-sharing bipartite graphs in the early-stage fusion. Then, a set of
diversified base clusterings for different view groups are obtained via fast
graph partitioning, which are further formulated into a unified bipartite graph
for final clustering in the late-stage fusion. Notably, FastMICE has almost
linear time and space complexity, and is free of dataset-specific tuning.
Experiments on 22 multi-view datasets demonstrate its advantages in scalability
(for extremely large datasets), superiority (in clustering performance), and
simplicity (to be applied) over the state-of-the-art. Code available:

audio events, but also the order information between events and the number of
events that occur in an audio clip. Most previous works on audio event sequence
analysis rely on connectionist temporal classification (CTC). However, CTC's
conditional independence assumption prevents it from effectively learning
correlations between diverse audio events. This paper first attempts to
introduce Transformer into sequential audio tagging, since Transformers perform
well in sequence-related tasks. To better utilize contextual information of
audio event sequences, we draw on the idea of bidirectional recurrent neural
networks, and propose a contextual Transformer (cTransformer) with a
bidirectional decoder that could exploit the forward and backward information
of event sequences. Experiments on the real-life polyphonic audio dataset show
that, compared to CTC-based methods, the cTransformer can effectively combine
the fine-grained acoustic representations from the encoder and coarse-grained
audio event cues to exploit contextual information to successfully recognize
and predict audio event sequences.

pre-processing techniques (generally used in machine learning), in light of the
multivariate nature of the data. A truncation step separate the main dynamics
driving the flow from less relevant non-linear dynamics. The method is applied
to analyse a database obtained from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulation of an axisymmetric, time varying, non-premixed, co-flow methane
flame carried out by means of a detailed kinetic mechanism. Results show that
HODMD can reconstruct the main jet dynamics with a reduced number of relevant
modes, able to reproduce the system dynamics. These modes are found to be
representative for the main flow physics with two main advantages: (i) they
provide for the possibility to achieve a strong simplification with respect to
the high-dimensional input data, and at the same time (ii) a small
reconstruction error with respect to the original dataset is observed. In
addition, the method was also validated considering a reduced matrix obtained
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based feature selection and the
Varimax rotation. This validation also reveals that it is not important to have
all the variables in the dataset, just a group of them is necessary to obtain
the main dynamics of the system. This has an impact on feature selection and on
the cost these methodologies for very massive data.

  Scale?","17 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unlike active array antennas, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are
efficiently implemented at large dimensions. This allows for traceable
realizations of large-scale IRS-aided MIMO systems in which not necessarily the
array antennas, but the passive IRSs are large. It is widely believed that
large IRS-aided MIMO settings maintain the fundamental features of massive MIMO
systems, and hence they are the implementationally feasible technology for
establishing the performance of large-scale MIMO settings. This work gives a
rigorous proof to this belief. We show that using a large passive IRS, the
end-to-end MIMO channel between the transmitter and the receiver always
hardens, even if the IRS elements are strongly correlated.
  For the fading direct and reflection links between the transmitter and the
receiver, our derivations demonstrate that as the number of IRS elements grows
large, the capacity of end-to-end channel converges in distribution to a
real-valued Gaussian random variable whose variance goes to zero. The order of
this drop depends on how the physical dimensions of the IRS grow. We derive
this order explicitly. Numerical experiments depict that the analytical
asymptotic distribution almost perfectly matches the histogram of the capacity,
even in practical scenarios.
  As a sample application of the results, we use the asymptotic
characterization to study the dimensional trade-off between the transmitter and
the IRS. The result is intuitive: For a given target performance, the larger
the IRS is, the less transmit antennas are required to achieve the target. For
an arbitrary ergodic and outage performance, we characterize this trade-off
analytically. Our investigations demonstrate that using a practical IRS size,
the target performance can be achieved with significantly small end-to-end MIMO
dimensions.

  Space for Face Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of face recognition (FR) can be viewed as a pair similarity
optimization problem, maximizing a similarity set $\mathcal{S}^p$ over positive
pairs, while minimizing similarity set $\mathcal{S}^n$ over negative pairs.
Ideally, it is expected that FR models form a well-discriminative feature space
(WDFS) that satisfies $\inf{\mathcal{S}^p} > \sup{\mathcal{S}^n}$. With regard
to WDFS, the existing deep feature learning paradigms (i.e., metric and
classification losses) can be expressed as a unified perspective on different
pair generation (PG) strategies. Unfortunately, in the metric loss (ML), it is
infeasible to generate negative pairs taking all classes into account in each
iteration because of the limited mini-batch size. In contrast, in
classification loss (CL), it is difficult to generate extremely hard negative
pairs owing to the convergence of the class weight vectors to their center.
This leads to a mismatch between the two similarity distributions of the
sampled pairs and all negative pairs. Thus, this paper proposes a unified
negative pair generation (UNPG) by combining two PG strategies (i.e., MLPG and
CLPG) from a unified perspective to alleviate the mismatch. UNPG introduces
useful information about negative pairs using MLPG to overcome the CLPG
deficiency. Moreover, it includes filtering the similarities of noisy negative
pairs to guarantee reliable convergence and improved performance. Exhaustive
experiments show the superiority of UNPG by achieving state-of-the-art
performance across recent loss functions on public benchmark datasets. Our code
and pretrained models are publicly available.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.SI cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to much closer to real application scenarios,the budgeted influence
maximization (BIM) problem has attracted great attention among researchers. As
a variant of the influence maximization (IM) problem, the BIM problem aims at
mining several nodes with different costs as seeds with limited budget to
maximize the influence as possible. By first activating these seed nodes and
spreading influence under the given propagation model, the maximized spread of
influence can be reached in the network.
  Several approaches have been proposed for BIM. Most of them are modified
versions of the greedy algorithm, which work well on the IM but seems
inefficient for the BIM because huge time consuming is inevitable. Recently,
some intelligence algorithms are proposed in order to reduce the running time,
but analysis shows that they cannot fully utilize the relationships between
nodes in networks, which will result in influence loss.
  Inspired by this, we propose an efficient method based on boosted simulated
annealing (SA) algorithm in this paper. Three heuristic strategies are proposed
to improve the performance and speed up the proposed algorithm. Experimental
results on both real world and synthetic networks demonstrate that the proposed
boosted SA performs much better than existed algorithms on performance with
almost equal or less running time.

preferences with respect to these. In order to account for the inherent
uncertainty in customer preferences, the problem is formulated as a
mixed-integer two-stage stochastic program with integer decision variables at
both stages. We propose an exact solution method for the problem based on the
integer L-Shaped method which exploits an efficient exact algorithm for the
solution of the subproblems. Tests on artificial instances based on the city of
Milan illustrate that the method can solve, or find good solutions to,
moderately sized instances for which a commercial solver fails. Furthermore,
our results suggest that, by adjusting prices between different zones of the
city, the operator can attract significantly more demand than with a fixed

large fleet, significantly reduces the relevance of staff-based relocations. A

study of rapidity-differential cross sections of coherent exclusive
photoproduction of $J/\psi$ mesons in heavy-ion ultraperipheral collisions
(UPCs) at the LHC, $d\sigma/dy(\text{Pb} + \text{Pb} \rightarrow \text{Pb} +
J/\psi + \text{Pb})$. For this, we account for the photon-nucleon NLO cross
sections at the forward limit, the $t$ dependence using a standard nuclear form
factor, and the photon fluxes of the colliding nuclei. Approximating the
generalized parton distributions with their forward-limit parton distribution
functions (PDFs), we quantify the NLO contributions in the cross sections, show
that the real part of the amplitude and quark-PDF contributions must not be
neglected, quantify the uncertainties arising from the scale-choice and PDFs,
and compare our results with ALICE, CMS and LHCb $J/\psi$ photoproduction data
in Pb+Pb UPCs, exclusive $J/\psi$ photoproduction data from HERA, and LHCb data
in p+p. The scale dependence in $d\sigma/dy(\text{Pb} + \text{Pb} \rightarrow
\text{Pb} + J/\psi + \text{Pb})$ is significant, but we can find a scale-choice
that reproduces the Pb+Pb UPC data both at 2.76 and 5.02 TeV collision
energies. This process has traditionally been suggested to be a direct probe of
nuclear gluon distributions. We show that the situation changes rather
dramatically from LO to NLO: the NLO cross sections reflect the nuclear effects
of both gluons and quarks in a complicated manner where the relative signs of
the LO and NLO terms in the amplitude play a significant role.

that would transform the current paradigm in collider development in addition
to non-collider searches in fundamental physics. PetaVolts per meter plasmonics
relies on collective oscillations of the free electron Fermi gas inherent in
the conduction band of materials that have a suitable combination of
constituent atoms and ionic lattice structure. As the conduction band free
electron density, at equilibrium, can be as high as $\rm 10^{24}cm^{-3}$,
electromagnetic fields of the order of $\rm 0.1 \sqrt{\rm n_0(10^{24}cm^{-3})}
~ PVm^{-1}$ can be sustained by plasmonic modes. Engineered materials not only
allow highly tunable material properties but quite critically make it possible
to overcome disruptive instabilities that dominate the interactions in bulk
media. Due to rapid shielding by the free electron Fermi gas, dielectric
effects are strongly suppressed. Because the ionic lattice, the corresponding
electronic energy bands and the free electron gas are governed by quantum
mechanical effects, comparisons with plasmas are merely notional. Based on this
framework, it is critical to address various challenges that underlie PetaVolts
per meter plasmonics including stable excitation of plasmonic modes while
accounting for their effects on the ionic lattice and the electronic energy
band structure over femtosecond timescales. We summarize the ongoing
theoretical and experimental efforts as well as map out strategies for the
future. Extreme plasmonic fields can shape the future by not only bringing tens
of TeV to multi-PeV center-of-mass-energies within reach but also by opening
novel pathways in non-collider HEP. In view of this promise, we invite the
scientific community to help realize the immense potential of PV/m plasmonics
and call for significant expansion of the US and international R\&D program.

Halpha component varies between ~2x10^38 erg/s and ~10^39 erg/s, with the FWHM
varying in the range ~500-1500 km/s. Unusually persistent P Cygni features are
clearly visible until the end of 2020 despite a decrease of the broad-to-narrow
flux ratio in the most recent years. A terminal velocity of ~800 km/s is
measured from the P Cygni profile, similar to the one in DDO 68, although the
latter is 3.7 more metal-deficient than PHL 293B. The relative constancy of the
broad Halpha luminosity in PHL 293B suggests that it is due to a long-lived
stellar transient of type LBV/SN IIn.

Given a source image and a driving video, the model should animate the new

similar motion as the pose sequence from the driving video. Despite the success
of Generative Adversarial Network (GANs) methods in image and video synthesis,
it is still very challenging to conduct cHMA due to the difficulty in
efficiently utilizing the conditional guided information such as images or
poses, and generating images of good visual quality. To this end, this paper
proposes a novel model of learning to Quantize, Scrabble, and Craft (QS-Craft)
for conditional human motion animation. The key novelties come from the newly
introduced three key steps: quantize, scrabble and craft. Particularly, our
QS-Craft employs transformer in its structure to utilize the attention

sequence extracted from the driving videos. Extensive experiments on human

system via compromising an edge model, resulting in malfunctioning of machine
learning models. Such compromised models are tampered with to perform
adversary-desired behaviors. In particular, we considered a semi-targeted
situation where the source class is predetermined however the target class is
not. The goal is to cause the global classifier to misclassify data of the
source class. Though approaches such as label flipping have been adopted to
inject poisoned parameters into FL, it has been shown that their performances
are usually class-sensitive varying with different target classes applied.
Typically, an attack can become less effective when shifting to a different
target class. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Attacking
Distance-aware Attack (ADA) to enhance a poisoning attack by finding the
optimized target class in the feature space. Moreover, we studied a more
challenging situation where an adversary had limited prior knowledge about a
client's data. To tackle this problem, ADA deduces pair-wise distances between
different classes in the latent feature space from shared model parameters
based on the backward error analysis. We performed extensive empirical
evaluations on ADA by varying the factor of attacking frequency in three
different image classification tasks. As a result, ADA succeeded in increasing
the attack performance by 1.8 times in the most challenging case with an
attacking frequency of 0.01.

The distribution
shift in features inherent to specific domains causes the negative transfer

leverages the underlying knowledge across client models trained on separate
data domains. Nonetheless, the data confidentiality of FL hinders the
effectiveness of traditional domain adaptation methods that require prior

generalization method called Federated Knowledge Alignment (FedKA). FedKA
leverages feature distribution matching in a global workspace such that the
global model can learn domain-invariant client features under the constraint of
unknown client data. FedKA employs a federated voting mechanism that generates
target domain pseudo-labels based on the consensus from clients to facilitate
global model fine-tuning. We performed extensive experiments, including an
ablation study, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both
image and text classification tasks using different model architectures. The
empirical results show that FedKA achieves performance gains of 8.8% and 3.5%

substantial improvements over prior work in both action and object

  Completion","12 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in few-shot knowledge graph
completion (FKGC), which aims to infer unseen query triples for a few-shot
relation using a few reference triples about the relation. The primary focus of
existing FKGC methods lies in learning relation representations that can
reflect the common information shared by the query and reference triples. To
this end, these methods learn entity-pair representations from the direct
neighbors of head and tail entities, and then aggregate the representations of
reference entity pairs. However, the entity-pair representations learned only
from direct neighbors may have low expressiveness when the involved entities
have sparse direct neighbors or share a common local neighborhood with other
entities. Moreover, merely modeling the semantic information of head and tail
entities is insufficient to accurately infer their relational information
especially when they have multiple relations. To address these issues, we
propose a Relation-Specific Context Learning (RSCL) framework, which exploits
graph contexts of triples to learn global and local relation-specific
representations for few-shot relations. Specifically, we first extract graph
contexts for each triple, which can provide long-term entity-relation
dependencies. To encode the extracted graph contexts, we then present a
hierarchical attention network to capture contextualized information of triples
and highlight valuable local neighborhood information of entities. Finally, we
design a hybrid attention aggregator to evaluate the likelihood of the query
triples at the global and local levels. Experimental results on two public
datasets demonstrate that RSCL outperforms state-of-the-art FKGC methods.

the propagation of a diffuse neutrino flux using transport equations for each

assumptions for the flavor composition emitted at the sources and for a normal

coupling of neutrinos with UALPs is the same for all flavors ($g_{\nu a}$), we
find that interactions change the flavor composition of neutrinos arriving on

flavor to dominate in the NO(IO) case for neutrino energies above $\sim
10^5\,{\rm GeV}$. Although current data on the flavor ratios suggest that

natural pruning strategy which enables the design of sparse architectures that

the model with numerical approximations, creating the software framework,
documenting and validating results. The relation between increased precision of
the results and increased complexity of tests and test frameworks is also
demonstrated based on these projects. The subject of scientific software
testing is addressed and the taxonomy of the scientific software tests is
presented including testing techniques used in the development of this
software.

datasets of accurate pixel-wise annotations, but manually labeling pixels is
time-consuming and labor-intensive. There are some weakly supervised methods
developed for alleviating the problem, such as image label, bounding box label,
and scribble label, while point label still has not been explored in this
field. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised salient object
detection method using point supervision. To infer the saliency map, we first
design an adaptive masked flood filling algorithm to generate pseudo labels.
Then we develop a transformer-based point-supervised saliency detection model
to produce the first round of saliency maps. However, due to the sparseness of
the label, the weakly supervised model tends to degenerate into a general
foreground detection model. To address this issue, we propose a Non-Salient
Suppression (NSS) method to optimize the erroneous saliency maps generated in
the first round and leverage them for the second round of training. Moreover,
we build a new point-supervised dataset (P-DUTS) by relabeling the DUTS
dataset. In P-DUTS, there is only one labeled point for each salient object.
Comprehensive experiments on five largest benchmark datasets demonstrate our
method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods trained with the
stronger supervision and even surpass several fully supervised state-of-the-art
models. The code is available at: https://github.com/shuyonggao/PSOD.

between agents. Achieving effective coordination in multi-agent systems is a
difficult task that remains largely unresolved. Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning has arisen as a powerful method to accomplish this task because it
considers the interaction between agents and also allows for decentralized
training -- which makes it highly scalable. However, transferring policies from
simulation to the real world is a big challenge, even for single-agent
applications. Multi-agent systems add additional complexities to the
Sim-to-Real gap due to agent collaboration and environment synchronization. In
this paper, we propose a method to transfer multi-agent autonomous driving
policies to the real world. For this, we create a multi-agent environment that
imitates the dynamics of the Duckietown multi-robot testbed, and train
multi-agent policies using the MAPPO algorithm with different levels of domain
randomization. We then transfer the trained policies to the Duckietown testbed
and compare the use of the MAPPO algorithm against a traditional rule-based
method. We show that the rewards of the transferred policies with MAPPO and
domain randomization are, on average, 1.85 times superior to the rule-based
method. Moreover, we show that different levels of parameter randomization have
a substantial impact on the Sim-to-Real gap.

These have been usually modelled by previous studies as a certain class of
Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) where goods must be delivered from a
depot to a set of customers in the same day that the orders were placed.
Adaptive exact solution methods for DVRPs can become intractable even for small
problem instances. In this paper, we formulate the SDDP as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) and solve it using a parameter-sharing Deep Q-Network, which
corresponds to a decentralised Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
approach. For this, we create a multi-agent grid-based SDD environment,
consisting of multiple vehicles, a central depot and dynamic order generation.
In addition, we introduce zone-specific order generation and reward
probabilities. We compare the performance of our proposed MARL approach against
a Mixed Inter Programming (MIP) solution. Results show that our proposed MARL
framework performs on par with MIP-based policy when the number of orders is
relatively low. For problem instances with higher order arrival rates,
computational results show that the MARL approach underperforms the MIP by up
to 30%. The performance gap between both methods becomes smaller when
zone-specific parameters are employed. The gap is reduced from 30% to 3% for a
5x5 grid scenario with 30 orders. Execution time results indicate that the MARL
approach is, on average, 65 times faster than the MIP-based policy, and
therefore may be more advantageous for real-time control, at least for
small-sized instances.

high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards
nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds
stably to only TiO2 and WO3, while 1-dodecanethiol binds stably only to ZnO and
CuO. Similarly, polar to non-polar solvent phase transfer of TiO2 and WO3
nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not by
1-dodecanethiol, while the contrary holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface
chemistry of ligand functionalized nanoparticles was probed by ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy, that enabled to elucidate the occupation of the ligands at the
active sites. The photo-stability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface
was determined by the photocatalytic self-cleaning properties of the material.
While TiO2 and WO3 degrade the ligands within 24 hours under both UV and
visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights
are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example,
since the ligand functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they

equation those theories predict different luminosity distances for
electromagnetic and gravitational waves (GWs). This effect can be parametrized
by the two variables $\Xi_0$ and $n$, that can be measured from gravitational
wave observations, and specifically from the binary black hole (BBH) mergers
detected by LIGO and Virgo. By fitting jointly BBH population models in mass
and redshift, the cosmological parameters, and the modified GW luminosity
distance to $\sim$ 60 signals observed during the first three LIGO/Virgo
observation runs, we conclude that general relativity is consistently the
preferred model. The future observation runs O4 and O5 are also considered.
Using the same approach, we forecast a measurement uncertainty on the modified
gravity parameter $\Xi_0$ of $51\%$ with O4, and $20\%$ with O4 and O5,
respectively if GR is the correct theory of gravity. However, we underline that
there are strong correlations between astrophysical, cosmological and modified

chemical stability by variation of the composition. The present numerical
simulation study compares Ag-Au alloy, Ag@Au core-shell, and Au@Ag core-shell
bimetallic plasmonic nanoparticles of both spherical and anisotropic
(nanotriangle and nanorods) shapes. By studying both spherical and anisotropic
(with LSPR in the near-infrared region) shapes, cases with and without
interband transitions of Au can be decoupled. Explicit comparisons are
facilitated by numerical models supported by careful validation and examination
of optical constants of Au-Ag alloys reported in literature. Although both
Au-Ag core-shell and alloy nanoparticles exhibit an intermediary optical
response between that of pure Ag and Au nanoparticles, there are noticeable
differences in the spectral characteristics. Also, the effect of the bimetallic
constitution in anisotropic nanoparticles is starkly different from that in
spherical nanoparticles due to the absence of Au interband transitions in the
former case. In general, the improved chemical stability of Ag nanoparticles by
incorporation of Au comes with a cost of reduction in plasmonic enhancement,
also applicable to anisotropic nanoparticles with a weaker effect. A
photothermal heat transfer study confirms that increased absorption by the
incorporation of Au in spherical Ag nanoparticles also results in an increased
steady state temperature. On the other hand, anisotropic nanoparticles are
inherently better absorbers, hence better photothermal sources and their
photothermal properties are apparently not strongly affected by the
incorporation of one metal in the other.

vision, which leaves CNN-based continual learning lagging behind as they can
suffer from severe performance degradation if straightforwardly applied to
ViTs. In this paper, we study ViT-backed continual learning to strive for
higher performance riding on recent advances of ViTs. Inspired by mask-based
continual learning methods in CNNs, where a mask is learned per task to adapt
the pre-trained ViT to the new task, we propose MEta-ATtention (MEAT), i.e.,
attention to self-attention, to adapt a pre-trained ViT to new tasks without
sacrificing performance on already learned tasks. Unlike prior mask-based
methods like Piggyback, where all parameters are associated with corresponding
masks, MEAT leverages the characteristics of ViTs and only masks a portion of
its parameters. It renders MEAT more efficient and effective with less overhead

significant superiority to its state-of-the-art CNN counterparts, with 4.0~6.0%

traditional state-of-the-art image and video compression methods process images
with a block-by-block processing approach for various reasons. Very recently,
work on learned image compression with block based approaches have also
appeared, which use the auto-encoder architecture on large blocks of the input
image and introduce additional neural networks that perform intra/spatial

alternative learned block-based image compression approach in which neither an
explicit intra prediction neural network nor an explicit deblocking neural
network is used. A single auto-encoder neural network with block-level masked
convolutions is used and the block size is much smaller (8x8). By using
block-level masked convolutions, each block is processed using reconstructed
neighboring left and upper blocks both at the encoder and decoder. Hence, the
mutual information between adjacent blocks is exploited during compression and
each block is reconstructed using neighboring blocks, resolving the need for
explicit intra prediction and deblocking neural networks. Since the explored
system is a closed loop system, a special optimization procedure, the
asymptotic closed loop design, is used with standard stochastic gradient
descent based training. The experimental results indicate competitive image

great success in neural networks (NNs). Due to the complex non-linear

project samples from their original feature space to a linear separable feature
space. This phenomenon ignites our interest in exploring whether all features
need to be transformed by all non-linear functions in current typical NNs,
i.e., whether there exists a part of features arriving at the linear separable
feature space in the intermediate layers, that does not require further
non-linear variation but an affine transformation instead. To validate the
above hypothesis, we explore the problem of linear feature disentanglement for
neural networks in this paper. Specifically, we devise a learnable mask module
to distinguish between linear and non-linear features. Through our designed
experiments we found that some features reach the linearly separable space
earlier than the others and can be detached partly from the NNs. The explored
method also provides a readily feasible pruning strategy which barely affects
the performance of the original model. We conduct our experiments on four

various pre-trained language models. They commonly attempt to learn
aspect-specific representation from the corpus. Unfortunately, the aspect is
often expressed implicitly through a set of representatives and thus renders
implicit mapping process unattainable unless sufficient labeled examples are
available. However, high-quality labeled examples may not be readily available
in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose to jointly address aspect

Specifically, we first introduce a simple but effective mechanism to construct

representation in response to the automatically constructed auxiliary-sentence
instead of the aspect itself. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance

to be localized in the sense that each agent has a bounded number of neighbors
and consider a scaling of the network through the addition of agents in a
modular manner, i.e., without re-tuning controller gains upon addition. We show
that standard consensus algorithms, which rely on relative state feedback, are
subject to what we term scale fragilities, meaning that stability is lost as
the network scales. For high-order agents ($n\ge 3$), we prove that no
consensus algorithm with fixed gains can achieve consensus in networks of any
size. That is, while a given algorithm may allow a small network to converge,
it causes instability if the network grows beyond a certain finite size. This
holds in families of network graphs whose algebraic connectivity, that is, the
smallest non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue, is decreasing towards zero in network
size (e.g. all planar graphs). For second-order consensus ($n = 2$) we prove
that the same scale fragility applies to directed graphs that have a complex
Laplacian eigenvalue approaching the origin (e.g. directed ring graphs). The
proofs for both results rely on Routh-Hurwitz criteria for complex-valued

existence of polar periodic orbits and invariant manifolds, and perturbative
treatments indicate that orbit flips are due to the libration of a certain

(a) flipping orbits are a kind of quasi-periodic trajectories around polar
periodic orbits and invariant manifolds at the same level of Hamiltonian
provide boundaries of flipping regions, and (b) flipping orbits are a kind of
resonant trajectories and resonant width measures the size of flipping regions.

star for an observer. This technique allows the determination of sizes and
shapes of the occulting body with kilometer precision. Also, this technique
constrains the occulting body's positions, albedos, densities, etc. In the
context of the Galilean moons, these events can provide their best ground-based
astrometry, with uncertainties in the order of 1 mas ($\sim$ 3 km at Jupiter's
distance during opposition). We organized campaigns and successfully observed a
stellar occultation by Io (JI) in 2021, one by Ganymede (JIII) in 2020, and one
by Europa (JII) in 2019, with stations in North and South America. Also, we
re-analyzed two previously published events, one by Europa in 2016 and another
by Ganymede in 2017. Then, we fit the known 3D shape of the occulting satellite
and determine its center of figure. That resulted in astrometric positions with
uncertainties in the milliarcsecond level. The positions obtained from these
stellar occultations can be used together with dynamical models to ensure
highly accurate orbits of the Galilean moons. These orbits can help plan future
space probes aiming at the Jovian system, such as JUICE by ESA and Europa
Clipper by NASA, and allow more efficient planning of flyby maneuvers.

significant advancements of model physics and numerical resources, the recent
numerical wave hindcast data has a potential to provide environmental
conditions for wave load estimation in the ship design process. This study aims
to quantify model uncertainty in the state of art numerical wave hindcast
products to get insight into the application of wave hindcast for ship design.
The model uncertainty is deduced based on the comparison with the wave buoys in
the North Atlantic as well as the inter-model comparison with four wave model
products. The multiple wave buoys distributed over the Northwest Atlantic and
Northeast Atlantic are considered as wave buoy arrays and used for model
evaluations. All the four models in general showed very good and similar
accuracy in the estimation of the significant wave height $H_s$. The model
$H_s$, however, deviates from buoys and also deviate among each other for the
extreme wave conditions of $H_s$>10. It is also found that there is
disagreement for the mean wave period $T_{m02}$ between numerical wave models
and the wave buoys. More specifically, the models underestimate $T_{m02}$ for
extreme wave conditions of $H_s$>10 in the Northeast Atlantic. The joint
probability density function (JPD) of the significant wave height $H_s$ and
mean wave period $T_{m02}$ for the extreme wave conditions are also derived.
Among the JPDs, the total number of samples that satisfies the extreme wave
conditions of $H_s$>10 and 8<$T_{m02}$<14 varied by 50% although the mean value
of the four model products is close to the observation. This study indicates
further model improvement is necessary to more accurately reproduce the extreme
conditions. For the model improvement as well as the model evaluation, more
measurements of the high sea states and their wave spectra information are
warranted.

study necessary or sufficient conditions for a quasi-isomorphism from its
twisted logarithmic subcomplex, called the logarithmic comparison theorem
(LCT), by using a stronger version in terms of the associated complex of
$D_X$-modules. In case the connection is a pullback by a defining function $f$
of the divisor and the residue is $\alpha$, we prove among others that if LCT
holds, the annihilator of $f^{\alpha-1}$ in $D_X$ is generated by first order
differential operators and $\alpha-1-j$ is not a root of the Bernstein-Sato
polynomial for any positive integer $j$. The converse holds assuming either of
the two conditions in case the associated complex of $D_X$-modules is acyclic

divisor is defined by a homogeneous polynomial, and the associated projective
hypersurface has only weighted homogeneous isolated singularities, we show that
LCT is equivalent to that $-1$ is the unique integral root of the

optimising a detector using a training set that contains only normal images.
UAD approaches can be based on reconstruction methods, self-supervised
approaches, and Imagenet pre-trained models. Reconstruction methods, which
detect anomalies from image reconstruction errors, are advantageous because
they do not rely on the design of problem-specific pretext tasks needed by
self-supervised approaches, and on the unreliable translation of models
pre-trained from non-medical datasets. However, reconstruction methods may fail
because they can have low reconstruction errors even for anomalous images. In
this paper, we introduce a new reconstruction-based UAD approach that addresses
this low-reconstruction error issue for anomalous images. Our UAD approach, the
memory-augmented multi-level cross-attentional masked autoencoder (MemMC-MAE),
is a transformer-based approach, consisting of a novel memory-augmented
self-attention operator for the encoder and a new multi-level cross-attention
operator for the decoder. MemMC-MAE masks large parts of the input image during
its reconstruction, reducing the risk that it will produce low reconstruction
errors because anomalies are likely to be masked and cannot be reconstructed.
However, when the anomaly is not masked, then the normal patterns stored in the
encoder's memory combined with the decoder's multi-level cross-attention will
constrain the accurate reconstruction of the anomaly. We show that our method
achieves SOTA anomaly detection and localisation on colonoscopy and Covid-19
Chest X-ray datasets.

Besides the classical ion-by-ion addition, non-classical crystallization
mechanisms, such as multi-ion polymer and nano-particle attachment, could be of
great significance under certain circumstances. These non-classical
crystallization processes have been observed with advanced microscopy, yet
detailed quantification of their contribution in mineral precipitation remains
challenging. Building from paired Ca and Sr isotope observations, we develop a
new theoretical framework to quantify the relative contribution of classical
and non-classical crystallization pathways on the precipitation of the calcium
carbonate mineral calcite, one of the most common precipitates in nature. We
demonstrate that the classical (ion-by-ion) crystallization pathway alone is
insufficient to account for the observed isotope behaviors and, thus, the
entire calcite precipitation process. We present a new kinetic surface reaction
model to incorporate the non-classical crystallization pathway. This new model,
for the first time, enables the detailed characterization of the roles of
classical and non-classical crystallization mechanisms in calcite
precipitation. The results suggest that the relative contribution of
non-classical crystallization pathways increases with saturation state and can,
under high supersaturation levels, be comparable to or greater than
precipitation driven by the classical crystallization pathway. The presented
theoretical framework readily explains observed trace element partitioning and
isotope fractionation behaviors during calcite precipitation and can be further
expanded onto other mineral systems to gain insights into crystal growth
mechanisms.

apparent motion of objects with microsecond resolution, and shows great
application potential in monitoring and other fields. However, the output event
stream of existing DVS inevitably contains background activity noise (BA noise)
due to dark current and junction leakage current, which will affect the
temporal correlation of objects, resulting in deteriorated motion estimation
performance. Particularly, the existing filter-based denoising methods cannot
be directly applied to suppress the noise in event stream, since there is no
spatial correlation. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel
progressive framework, in which a Motion Estimation (ME) module and an Event
Denoising (ED) module are jointly optimized in a mutually reinforced manner.
Specifically, based on the maximum sharpness criterion, ME module divides the
input event into several segments by adaptive clustering in a motion
compensating warp field, and captures the temporal correlation of event stream
according to the clustered motion parameters. Taking temporal correlation as
guidance, ED module calculates the confidence that each event belongs to real
activity events, and transmits it to ME module to update energy function of
motion segmentation for noise suppression. The two steps are iteratively
updated until stable motion segmentation results are obtained. Extensive
experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed approaches against the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)

and online simulation stage with different parameters. In the training stage, a
parameter-independent and small-dimensional multiscale basis function space is
constructed, which includes the media, source and boundary information. The key
part of the basis generation stage is to solve some local problems defined
specially. With the parameter-independent basis space, one can efficiently
solve the concerned problems corresponding to different samples of permeability
field in a coarse grid without repeatedly constructing a multiscale space for
each new sample. A rigorous analysis on convergence of the proposed method is

constructed with one source will be used to a different source. In the

3-wave interactions. In the kinetic regime of wave turbulence, which assumes
weak nonlinearity and large system size, the relevant observable associated
with the wave amplitude is the empirical spectral density that appears as the
natural precursor of the spectral density, or spectrum, for finite system size.
Following classical derivations of the Peierls equation for the moment
generating function of the wave amplitudes in the kinetic regime, we propose a
large deviation estimate for the dynamics of the empirical spectral density,
where the number of admissible wavenumbers, which is proportional to the volume
of the system, appears as the natural large deviation parameter. The large
deviation stochastic Hamiltonian that quantifies the minus of the log
probability of a trajectory is computed within the kinetic regime which assumes
the Random Phase approximation for weak nonlinearity. We compare this
Hamiltonian with the one for a system of modes interacting in a mean-field way
with the empirical spectrum. Its relationship with the Random Phase and
Amplitude approximation is discussed. Moreover, for the specific case when no
forces and dissipation are present, a few fundamental properties of the large
deviation dynamics are investigated. We show that the latter conserves total
energy and momentum, as expected for a 3-wave interacting systems. In addition,
we compute the equilibrium quasipotential and check that global detailed
balance is satisfied at the large deviation level. Finally, we discuss briefly
some physical applications of the theory.

resulting operators are periodic or the resulting spectra must be Cantor sets.
The main ingredient is a suitable stability result for Boshernitzan's criterion
under taking products. We also discuss the stability of purely singular
continuous spectrum, which, given the zero-measure spectrum result, amounts to
stability results for eigenvalue exclusion. In particular, we examine
situations in which the existing criteria for the exclusion of eigenvalues are
stable under periodic perturbations. As a highlight of this, we show that any
simple Toeplitz subshift over a binary alphabet exhibits uniform absence of
eigenvalues on the hull for any periodic perturbation whose period is
commensurate with the coding sequence. In the case of a full shift, we give an
effective criterion to compute exactly the spectrum of a random Anderson model
perturbed by a potential of period two, and we further show that the naive
generalization of this criterion does not hold for period three. Next, we
consider quasi-periodic potentials with potentials generated by trigonometric
polynomials with periodic background. We show that the quasiperiodic cocycle
induced by passing to blocks of period length is subcritical when the coupling
constant is small and supercritical when the coupling constant is large. Thus,
the spectral type is absolutely continuous for small coupling and pure point

preceded by an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in near surface
temperature, which is consistent with more extreme dry seasons. Based-on the

and reliable ones are the iterative ones, although they have a main drawback in
common: the involved systems are required to be capable of rollback. The latter

heavily depends on the ability of restoration methods and the quality of the
input. Although existing research on image restoration focuses on developing
models for obtaining better restored results, fewer have studied to evaluate
how and which input image leads to superior restored quality. In this paper, to
better study an image's potential value that can be explored for restoration,
we propose a novel concept, referring to image restoration potential (IRP).
Specifically, We first establish a dynamic scene imaging dataset containing
composite distortions and applied image restoration processes to validate the
rationality of the existence to IRP. Based on this dataset, we investigate
several properties of IRP and propose a novel deep model to accurately predict
IRP values. By gradually distilling and selective fusing the degradation
features, the proposed model shows its superiority in IRP prediction. Thanks to
the proposed model, we are then able to validate how various image restoration
related applications are benefited from IRP prediction. We show the potential
usages of IRP as a filtering principle to select valuable frames, an auxiliary
guidance to improve restoration models, and even an indicator to optimize

neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) for inferring the Hubble constant
from a population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. This method is useful
in exploiting BNSs as standard sirens when their redshifts are not available.
Gravitational wave (GW) signals from compact object binaries provide a direct
measurement of their luminosity distances, but not their redshifts. Unlike in
the past, here we employ a realistic EoS parametrization in a Bayesian
framework to simultaneously measure the Hubble constant and refine the
constraints on the EoS parameters. The uncertainty in the redshift depends on
the uncertainties in the EoS and the mass parameters estimated from GW data.
Combining the inferred BNS redshifts with the corresponding luminosity
distances, one constructs a redshift-distance relation and deduces the Hubble
constant from it. Here, we show that in the Cosmic Explorer era, one can
measure the Hubble constant to a precision of $\lesssim 5\%$ (with a $90\%$
credible interval) with a realistic distribution of a thousand BNSs, while
allowing for uncertainties in their EoS parameters. Such a measurement can
potentially resolve the current tension in the measurements of the Hubble
constant from the early- and late-time universe. The methodology implemented in
this work demonstrates a comprehensive prescription for inferring the NS EoS
and the Hubble constant by simultaneously combining GW observations from
merging NSs, while employing a simple population model for NS masses and
keeping the merger rate of NSs constant in redshift. This method can be

time-consuming, require expert-knowledge, and suffer from a lack of

generates reproducible images in an expedient fashion. To this end, we take
advantage of the efficiency of Convolutional Neural Networks to reconstruct
image data from incomplete information in Fourier space. The Neural Network
architecture is inspired by super-resolution models that utilize residual
blocks. Using simulated data of radio galaxies that are composed of Gaussian
components we train Deep Learning models whose reconstruction capability is
quantified using various measures. The reconstruction performance is evaluated
on clean and noisy input data by comparing the resulting predictions with the
true source images. We find that source angles and sizes are well reproduced,
while the recovered fluxes show substantial scatter, albeit not worse than
existing methods without fine-tuning. Finally, we propose more advanced
approaches using Deep Learning that include uncertainty estimates and a concept
to analyze larger images.

convergent policy gradient method for continuous space-time control problems

gradient algorithms for feedback controls of finite-time horizon stochastic
control problems. The state dynamics are nonlinear diffusions with
control-affine drift, and the cost functions are nonconvex in the state and
nonsmooth in the control. The system noise can degenerate, which allows for
deterministic control problems as special cases. We prove under suitable
conditions that the algorithm converges linearly to a stationary point of the
control problem, and is stable with respect to policy updates by approximate
gradient steps. The convergence result justifies the recent reinforcement
learning heuristics that adding entropy regularization or a fictitious discount
factor to the optimization objective accelerates the convergence of policy
gradient methods. The proof exploits careful regularity estimates of backward
stochastic differential equations.

reduces the numerical complexity in comparison to the full electron dynamics.
Non-collinear magnetic configurations are stabilized by a constraining field,
which allows to directly obtain the effective magnetic field from the negative
of the constraining field. While the dynamics are shown to conserve energy, we
demonstrate that adiabatic spin dynamics does not conserve the total spin
angular momentum when the lengths of the magnetic moments are allowed to
change, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Furthermore, we develop a
method to extract an effective two-spin exchange interaction from the energy
curvature tensor of non-collinear states, which we calculate at each time step

preserves the identity element of $B$ and has the property that for every $a\in
B$ there exists a positive integer $i_a$ such that $\varphi(ab) =
\varphi(a)\varphi^{i_a}(b)$ for all $b\in B$. The problem of classifying skew
morphisms for all finite cyclic groups is notoriously hard, with no such
classification available up to date. Each skew morphism $\varphi$ of
$\mathbb{Z}_n$ is closely related to a specific skew morphism of
$\mathbb{Z}_{|\!\langle \varphi \rangle\!|}$, called the quotient of $\varphi$.
In this paper, we use this relationship and other observations to prove new
theorems about skew morphisms of finite cyclic groups. In particular, we
classify skew morphisms for all cyclic groups of order $2^em$ with $e\in
\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and $m$ odd and square-free. We also develop an algorithm for
finding skew morphisms of cyclic groups, and implement this algorithm in MAGMA
to obtain a census of all skew morphisms for cyclic groups of order up to
$161$. During the preparation of this paper we noticed a few flaws in Section~5
of the paper Cyclic complements and skew morphisms of groups [J. Algebra 453

performed with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can cover large areas in a

need for high-resolution images for precise classification of features (e.g.,
detecting even the smallest weeds in the field) contrasts with the limited
payload and ight time of current UAVs. Thus, it requires several flights to
cover a large field uniformly. However, the assumption that the whole field
must be observed with the same precision is unnecessary when features are
heterogeneously distributed, like weeds appearing in patches over the field. In
this case, an adaptive approach that focuses only on relevant areas can perform
better, especially when multiple UAVs are employed simultaneously. Leveraging
on a swarm-robotics approach, we propose a monitoring and mapping strategy that
adaptively chooses the target areas based on the expected information gain,

smaller mapping errors than optimal pre-planned monitoring approaches.

This study seeks to evaluate and analyze SDG target interactions in the

interactions, two methods are employed. First, experts with over five years of
SDG-related experience evaluated interactions using a 7-point scale. Second, a
non-parametric Spearman rank correlation is used on official indicator data
with resulting coefficients serving as interaction scores. Interaction scores
are then coded as synergies (interact positively), trade-offs (negatively) or
non-classified (neutrally). Targets are also modelled as nodes and interactions
as edges in graphs presented in sdginteractions.herokuapp.com. Results from the
two methods were synthesized to formulate recommendations for concerned
parties. This includes resolving negative intra-goal target interactions

transport system, and, if is performed covertly, the system can be negatively
affected for a long period of time. This paper develops a simulation stochastic
cellular automata model of traffic on a circular two-lane road based on the
Sakai-Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider (S-NFS) rules. In the presented model, in
addition to ordinary vehicles, there are covertly counteracting vehicles; their
task is to reduce the quantity indicators (such as traffic flux) of the
transport system using special rules of behavior. Three such rules are
considered and compared: two lane-changing rules and one slow-down rule. It is
shown that such counteracting vehicles can affect the traffic flow, mainly in
the region of the maximum of the fundamental diagram, that is, at average
values of the vehicle density. In free-flowing traffic or in a traffic jam, the
influence of the counteracting vehicle is negligible regardless of its rules of
behavior.

that the disparities largely reflect differences in drug use between racial

disparities in the enforcement of marijuana violations in the US. Using data
from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the National
Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) programs, we investigate whether
marijuana usage and purchasing behaviors can explain the racial composition of
offenders in police records. We examine potential driving mechanisms behind
these disparities and the extent to which county-level socioeconomic factors
are associated with corresponding disparities. Our results indicate that the
significant racial disparities in reported incidents and arrests cannot be
explained by differences in marijuana days-of-use alone. Variations in the
location where marijuana is purchased and in the frequency of these purchases
partially explain the observed disparities. We observe an increase in racial
disparities across most counties over the last decade, with the greatest
increases in states that legalized the use of marijuana within this timeframe.
Income, high school graduation rate, and rate of employment positively
correlate with larger racial disparities, while the rate of incarceration is
negatively correlated. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the
observed racial disparities in the context of algorithmic fairness.

neutrino flavor oscillations. Due to the high matter density in the core of the
Sun, solar neutrinos are suited to probe these interactions. Using the $277$

1.8$\sigma$, and with up quarks at 1.6$\sigma$, with the best fit NSI

$d$-quarks and ($\epsilon_{11}^{u},\epsilon_{12}^{u}$) = (-2.5, -3.1) for

We further demonstrate that, for pumping and tuning the flow rate, a

voice characteristics such as differences in formant and fundamental
frequencies, we propose the use of two separate transformer encoders for the
extraction of specific voice features in the male and female gender, using
wav2vec 2.0 as a common-level feature extractor. This architecture reduces the
interference effects during backpropagation and improves the generalizability
of the model. We perform our experiments on the TIMIT dataset and significantly
outperform the current state-of-the-art results on age estimation.
Specifically, we achieve root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.54 years and 6.49

evaluate the relative importance of different phonetic types for our task
demonstrate that vowel sounds are the most distinguishing for age estimation.

the external/internal convertible-based control with leg-assisted impulse
control. The leg-terrain interaction generates assistive impulsive torques to
help maintain the navigation and balance capability when running across
obstacles. The control performance is analyzed and guaranteed. The experimental
results confirm that under the control design, the bikebot can smoothly run
crossing multiple step-like obstacles with height more than one third of the

those under only the velocity and steering control without leg assistive

flow in tight reservoirs typically characterized by low, multiscale porosity.
Multiscale porosity implies that the computational domain contains porous
voxels (unresolved porosity) in addition to pure fluid voxels. In this case,
the Stokes-Brinkman equations govern the flow, with the Darcy term needed to
account for the flow in the porous voxels. As the central part of our workflow,
robust and efficient solvers for Stokes and Stokes-Brinkman equations are
presented. The solvers are customized for low-porosity binary and multiclass
images, respectively. Another essential component of the workflow is a
preprocessing module for classifying images with respect to the connectivity of
the multiscale pore space. Particularly, an approximation of the
Stokes-Brinkman problem, namely, the Darcy problem, is investigated for the
images that do not have pure fluid percolation paths. Thorough computational
experiments demonstrate efficiency and robustness of the workflow for
simulations on images from tight reservoirs. Raw files describing the used CT
images are provided as supplementary materials to enable other researchers to

magnet. Especially, its high magnetic ordering temperature and versatile
magneto-transport properties make CrSBr an important candidate for new devices

magnetic and structural properties of CrSBr have not been fully elucidated.
Here, we report on the detailed temperature-dependent magnetic and structural
properties of this material, by comprehensively combining neutron scattering,
muon spin relaxation spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and
magnetization measurements. We evidence that this material undergoes a
transition to an A-type antiferromagnetic state below $T_{\rm N} \approx$ 140
K, with a pronounced two-dimensional character as deduced from the determined
critical exponent of $\beta \approx $ 0.18. In our analysis of the
field-induced metamagnetic transition, we find that the ferromagnetic
correlations within the monolayers persist clearly above the N\'eel temperature
in this material. Furthermore, we unravel the low-temperature (i.e. $T < T_{\rm
N}$) magnetic hidden order within the long-range magnetically ordered state. We
find that it is associated to a slowing down of the magnetic fluctuations,
accompanied by a continuous reorientation of the internal magnetic field. These
take place upon cooling below $T_s$ $\approx$ 100 K, until a spin freezing
process occurs at $T$* $\approx$ 40 K. We argue this complex dynamic behavior
to reflect a magnetic crossover driven by the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy,
which is ultimately caused by the mixed-anion character of the material. Our
findings indicate that the magnetic and structural properties of CrSBr widen
its potential application as a component for spin-based electronic devices.

($r_{1/2} = 41^{+8}_{-6}$ pc; $M_V = -4.25 \pm 0.2$ mag) located at a
heliocentric distance of $90^{+4}_{-6}$ kpc. Based on spectra of seven
non-variable member stars observed with Magellan/IMACS, we confidently resolve
Pegasus IV's velocity dispersion, measuring $\sigma_{v} = 3.3^{+1.7}_{-1.1}
\text{ km s}^{-1}$ (after excluding three velocity outliers); this implies a
mass-to-light ratio of $M_{1/2}/L_{V,1/2} = 167^{+224}_{-99}
M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ for the system. From the five stars with the highest
signal-to-noise spectra, we also measure a systemic metallicity of $\rm [Fe/H]
= -2.67^{+0.25}_{-0.29}$ dex, making Pegasus IV one of the most metal-poor
ultra-faint dwarfs. We tentatively resolve a non-zero metallicity dispersion
for the system. These measurements provide strong evidence that Pegasus IV is a
dark-matter-dominated dwarf galaxy, rather than a star cluster. We measure
Pegasus IV's proper motion using data from Gaia Early Data Release 3, finding
($\mu_{\alpha*}, \mu_{\delta}) = (0.33\pm 0.07, -0.21 \pm 0.08) \text{ mas

motion suggests that Pegasus IV is on an elliptical, retrograde orbit, and is
currently near its orbital apocenter. Lastly, we identify three potential RR
Lyrae variable stars within Pegasus IV, including one candidate member located
more than ten half-light radii away from the system's centroid. The discovery
of yet another ultra-faint dwarf galaxy strongly suggests that the census of
Milky Way satellites is still incomplete, even within 100 kpc.

decreasing at a rate of $(-7.11 \pm 0.33)\times 10^{-11}$. Due to light
dilution by a brighter companion, the observed amplitude of pulsation is much
smaller than in other BLAPs. From available photometry, we derived times of
maximum light, which revealed the binary nature of the star via O-C diagram.
The diagram shows variations with a period of 23.08433 d that we attribute to
the light-travel-time effect in the system. The analysis of these variations
allowed to derive the spectroscopic parameters of the BLAP's orbit around the
center of the mass of the binary. The presence of a hot companion in the system
was confirmed by the analysis of its spectral energy distribution, which was
also used to place the components in the H-R diagram. The obtained position of
the BLAP fully agrees with the location of the other members of the class. With
the estimated V~11 mag and the Gaia distance of less than 0.5 kpc, the BLAP is
the brightest and the nearest of all known BLAPs. It may become a clue object
in the verification of the evolutionary scenarios for this class of variable.
We argue that low-mass progenitors of the BLAP are excluded if the components
are coeval and no mass transfer between the components took place.

intelligent tasks e.g., vulnerability detection, clone detection. A
considerable amount of existing works propose diverse approaches to learn the
program semantics for different tasks and these works have achieved
state-of-the-art performance. However, currently, a comprehensive and
systematic study on evaluating different program representation techniques
across diverse tasks is still missed.
  From this starting point, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study to
evaluate different program representation techniques. Specifically, we
categorize current mainstream code representation techniques into four
categories i.e., Feature-based, Sequence-based, Tree-based, and Graph-based
program representation technique and evaluate its performance on three diverse
and popular code intelligent tasks i.e., {Code Classification}, Vulnerability
Detection, and Clone Detection on the public released benchmark. We further
design three {research questions (RQs)} and conduct a comprehensive analysis to
investigate the performance. By the extensive experimental results, we conclude
that (1) The graph-based representation is superior to the other selected
techniques across these tasks. (2) Compared with the node type information used
in tree-based and graph-based representations, the node textual information is
more critical to learning the program semantics. (3) Different tasks require
the task-specific semantics to achieve their highest performance, however
combining various program semantics from different dimensions such as control
dependency, data dependency can still produce promising results.

stiffness of the EOS increases with $\alpha $, which allows us to obtain a
hybrid star with a maximum mass of 2.40 solar-mass through our model. The

other approaches as they are data-driven estimators. As such, they have the
potential to perform well on a large class of capacity problems. In order to
test the performance across various NMIEs, it is desirable to establish a
benchmark encompassing the different challenges of capacity estimation. This is
the objective of this paper. In particular, we consider three scenarios for
benchmarking:i the classic AWGN channel, ii channels continuous inputs optical
intensity and peak-power constrained AWGN channel iii channels with a discrete
output, i.e., Poisson channel. We also consider the extension to the
multi-terminal case with iv the AWGN and optical MAC models. We argue that
benchmarking a certain NMIE across these four scenarios provides a substantive
test of performance. In this paper we study the performance of mutual

simultaneously 1) prioritizes inclusion of adjustment variables in accordance
with existing principles of confounder selection; 2) estimates causal effects
in a manner that permits complex relationships among confounders, exposures,
and outcomes; and 3) provides causal estimates that account for uncertainty in
the nature of confounding. The proposal relies on specification of multiple
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees models, linked together with a common prior
distribution that accrues posterior selection probability to covariates on the
basis of association with both the exposure and the outcome of interest. A set
of extensive simulation studies demonstrates that the proposed method performs
well relative to similarly-motivated methodologies in a variety of scenarios.
We deploy the method to investigate the causal effect of emissions from
coal-fired power plants on ambient air pollution concentrations, where the
prospect of confounding due to local and regional meteorological factors
introduces uncertainty around the confounding role of a high-dimensional set of
measured variables. Ultimately, we show that the proposed method produces more
efficient and more consistent results across adjacent years than alternative
methods, lending strength to the evidence of the causal relationship between

self-supervised denoising. Nevertheless, they are still bound to synthetic
noisy inputs due to less practical assumptions like pixel-wise independent
noise. Hence, it is challenging to deal with spatially correlated real-world
noise using self-supervised BSN. Recently, pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) has
been proposed to remove the spatial correlation of real-world noise. However,
it is not trivial to integrate PD and BSN directly, which prevents the fully
self-supervised denoising model on real-world images. We propose an Asymmetric
PD (AP) to address this issue, which introduces different PD stride factors for
training and inference. We systematically demonstrate that the proposed AP can
resolve inherent trade-offs caused by specific PD stride factors and make BSN
applicable to practical scenarios. To this end, we develop AP-BSN, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising method for real-world sRGB images.
We further propose random-replacing refinement, which significantly improves
the performance of our AP-BSN without any additional parameters. Extensive
studies demonstrate that our method outperforms the other self-supervised and
even unpaired denoising methods by a large margin, without using any additional
knowledge, e.g., noise level, regarding the underlying unknown noise.

of numerical simulations and comparison with linear stability theory. Two
simplified models based on the stability of vortices are developed for all
degrees of freedom of turbine motion. In our numerical simulations, the wind
turbine blades are modeled as actuator lines and a spectral-element method with
low dispersion and dissipation is employed to study the evolution of the
perturbations. The turbine motion excites vortex instability modes predicted by
the linear stability of helical vortices. The flow structures that are formed
in the non-linear regime are a consequence of the growth of these modes and
preserve some of the characteristics that can be explained and predicted by the
linear theory. The number of vortices that interact and the growth rate of
disturbances are well predicted by a simple stability model of a
two-dimensional row of vortices. For all types of motion, the highest growth
rate is observed when the frequency of motion is one and a half the frequency
of rotation of the turbine; that induces the out-of-phase vortex pairing
mechanism. For lower frequencies of motion, several vortices coalesce to form
large flow structures, which cause high amplitude of oscillations in the
streamwise velocities, that may increase fatigue or induce high amplitude
motion on downstream turbines.

paper, we employ contraction theory to improve the robustness of neural ODEs

perturbations in initial conditions become less and less relevant over time.
Since in NODEs the input data corresponds to the initial condition of dynamical
systems, we show contractivity can mitigate the effect of input perturbations.
More precisely, inspired by NODEs with Hamiltonian dynamics, we propose a class
of contractive Hamiltonian NODEs (CH-NODEs). By properly tuning a scalar
parameter, CH-NODEs ensure contractivity by design and can be trained using
standard backpropagation. Moreover, CH-NODEs enjoy built-in guarantees of
non-exploding gradients, which ensure a well-posed training process. Finally,

likely a dwarf galaxy. Although 20 years have past since their discovery, it is
still unclear whether their members are chemically distinguishable from other
halo stars in the Milky Way. Aim: We aim to precisely characterize the chemical
properties of the Helmi streams. Methods: We analysed high-resolution,
high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra for eleven Helmi streams' stars through a
line-by-line abundance analysis. We compared the derived abundances to
homogenized literature abundances of the other halo stars, including those
belonging to other kinematic substructures, such as Gaia-Enceladus and Sequoia.
Results: Compared to typical halo stars, the Helmi streams' members clearly
show low values of [X/Fe] in elements produced by massive stars, such as Na and
$\alpha$-elements. This tendency is seen down to metallicities of at least
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\sim -2.2$, suggesting type~Ia supernovae already started to
contribute to the chemical evolution at this metallicity. We found that the
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratio does not evolve much with metallicity, making the Helmi
streams' stars less distinguishable from Gaia-Enceladus stars at
$[\mathrm{Fe/H}]\gtrsim -1.5$. The almost constant but low value of
[$\alpha$/Fe] might be indicative of quiescent star formation with low
efficiency at the beginning and bursty star formation at later times. We also
found extremely low values of [Y/Fe] at low metallicity, providing further
support that light neutron capture-elements are deficient in Helmi streams.
While Zn is deficient at low metallicity, it shows a large spread at high
metallicity. The origin of the extremely low Y abundances and Zn variations
remain unclear. Conclusion: The Helmi streams' stars are distinguishable from
the majority of the halo stars if homogeneously derived abundances are
compared.

understood. We explore instabilities induced by centrifugal forces and angular
momentum transport in massive rotating stars. First, we derive and numerically
solve linearized oscillation equations for adiabatic radial modes in polytropic
stellar models. In the presence of differential rotation, we show that
centrifugal and Coriolis forces combined with viscous angular momentum
transport can excite stellar pulsation modes, under both low- or high-viscosity
conditions. In the low-viscosity limit, which is common in real stars, we
demonstrate how to compute mode growth/damping rates via a work integral.
Finally, we build realistic rotating $30\,M_\odot$ star models and show that
overstable (growing) radial modes are predicted to exist for most of the star's
life, in the absence of non-adiabatic effects. Peak growth rates are predicted
to occur while the star is crossing the Hertzsprung-Russell gap, though
non-adiabatic damping may dominate over viscous driving, depending on the
effective viscosity produced by convective and/or magnetic torques. Viscous
instability could be a new mechanism to drive massive star pulsations and is
possibly related to instabilities of luminous blue variable stars.

research of SINS(Strapdown Inertial Navigation System). Error distribution
result can provide the contribution of different errors to final navigation
error, which is helpful for modifying and optimizing SINS. To realize
decomposing the navigation error into parts that caused by each error source,
the SINS error state space model is established and covariance matrix is
decomposed according to error sources. The proposed error distribution analysis
method based on 34-dimension SINS error model can quantitatively analyze the
contribution to the end navigation error of initial errors, IMU(Inertial
Measurement Unit) bias, IMU scale factor errors, mounting errors of gyroscopes
and accelerometers, and IMU stochastic errors. The simulations in static
condition and single axis rotation condition indict that the distribution
result of proposed analysis method accords with the law of error propagation.
After trajectory determined, the corresponding error distribution result will
be calculated with the proposed method. Compared with the Monte-Carlo method
and other method based on covariance matrix, the proposed method uses more
complete error model, considers the interaction effect of error sources and can
be easily realized with less computation.

Spectral analyses of the orbits and interpretation of them in dynamical maps

  We show that the current geometric orbit of Methone is aligned with Mimas'

generalization. However, defining and quantifying modularity remains an open
problem. We cast the problem of detecting functional modules into the problem
of detecting clusters of similar-functioning units. This begs the question of
what makes two units functionally similar. For this, we consider two broad
families of methods: those that define similarity based on how units respond to
structured variations in inputs (""upstream""), and those based on how variations
in hidden unit activations affect outputs (""downstream""). We conduct an
empirical study quantifying modularity of hidden layer representations of
simple feedforward, fully connected networks, across a range of
hyperparameters. For each model, we quantify pairwise associations between
hidden units in each layer using a variety of both upstream and downstream
measures, then cluster them by maximizing their ""modularity score"" using
established tools from network science. We find two surprising results: first,
dropout dramatically increased modularity, while other forms of weight
regularization had more modest effects. Second, although we observe that there
is usually good agreement about clusters within both upstream methods and
downstream methods, there is little agreement about the cluster assignments
across these two families of methods. This has important implications for
representation-learning, as it suggests that finding modular representations
that reflect structure in inputs (e.g. disentanglement) may be a distinct goal
from learning modular representations that reflect structure in outputs (e.g.
compositionality).

structural decomposition into disk (D), diffuse bulge (dB), and compact bulge

steeper $M_*-R_e$ relations, likely indicating distinct evolutionary
mechanisms. Ellipticals and disk structures follow consistently unchanged
slopes of $\sim0.5$ and $\sim0.3$, respectively, at all redshifts. We quantify
that disks follow a redshift independent $M_*-R_e$ slope regardless of the
presence or absence of a bulge component (i.e., BD or pD) suggesting a similar
origin and evolutionary pathway for all disks. Since $z = 1$ compact-bulges
present a steepening relation which do not follow that of Es whilst
diffuse-bulges experience a modest flattening. Overall, we find a close-to-no
variation in the $M_*-R_e$ relations over the last $\sim8$ Gyr suggesting that
despite ongoing although declining star-formation, mass evolution,
morphological transitions and mergers, evolution moves galaxies along their
$M_*-R_e$ trails. This seems to be consistent with an inside-out growth and
evolution picture in which galaxies grow in size as they do in stellar mass.
Besides, minor mergers are likely to be responsible for the growth of Es, at
least in $z < 1$.

constraints, control over systematic uncertainties on the incoming neutrino
flux and interaction models is increasingly important. The intense beams
offered by modern experiments permit a variety of options to constrain the flux
using in situ ""standard candle"" measurements. These standard candles must use
very well understood processes to avoid introducing bias. One option discussed
in this context is the ""low-$\nu$"" method, designed to isolate neutrino
interactions where there is low energy-transfer to the nucleus, such that the
cross section is expected to be approximately constant as a function of
neutrino energy. The shape of the low-energy transfer event sample can then be
used to extract the flux shape. Applications of the method at high neutrino
energies (many tens of GeV) are well understood. However, the applicability of
the method at the few-GeV energies of current and future accelerator neutrino
experiments remains unclear due to the presence of nuclear and form-factor
effects.
  In this analysis we examine the prospects for improving constraints on
accelerator neutrino fluxes with the low-$\nu$ method in an
experiment-independent way, using (anti)neutrino interactions on argon and
hydrocarbon targets from the GENIE, NEUT, NuWro and GiBUU event generators. The
results show that flux constraints from the low-$\nu$ method would be severely
dependent on the specific interaction model assumptions used in an analysis for
neutrino energies less than 5 GeV. The spread of model predictions show that a
low-$\nu$ analysis is unlikely to offer much improvement on typical neutrino
flux uncertainties, even with a perfect detector. Notably -- running counter to
the assumption inherent to the low-$\nu$ method -- the model-dependence
increases with decreasing energy transfer for experiments in the few-GeV
region.

dynamics of the step train. The critical is step motion at the rear of the
train which leads to double and multiple step creation. The condition is that
the step density ratio in and out of the train lower than 2 prevents double
step formation irrespective of the kinetics. For higher step density ratio low
density of the step promotes single step stability. Fast step kinetics from
lower terrace stabilizes the single steps slow (high barrier) is promoting step
coalescence. The incorporation kinetics from upper terrace role is close to
neutral. The creation of double step creates slow the step in front to
accelerate and catch the previous double step while those behind catch up the
double step creating multistep structure. The multistep are not mobile as the
alimentation leads to emission of single step which moves forward. The final
structure consist of macrosteps and superterraces with the number of single
steps moving forward. Thus the single step motion is essential crystal growth
mode despite the presence of the macrosteps. The macrostep are prone to
creation of the overhangs which results from surface dynamics coupling to
impingement from the mother phase. The angular preferential access of the bulk

register automata (RA) used for representing a regular valuation to be
backward-deterministic. This paper proposes another approach to the same
problem, in which the model checking problem for RPDS is reduced to that

The construction in the proposed method is simpler than the previous model
checking method and does not require RAs deterministic or
backward-deterministic, and the bisimulation equivalence clearly guarantees the
correctness of this reduction. On the other hand, the proposed method requires
every RPDS (and RA) to have the freshness property, in which whenever the RPDS
updates a register with a data value not stored in any register or the stack
top, the value should be fresh. This paper also shows that this model checking
problem with regular valuations defined by general RA is undecidable, and thus
the freshness constraint is essential in the proposed method.

instance is crucial in order to select the most appropriate algorithm for
solving that problem instance. For this purpose, recent studies learn a
supervised machine learning (ML) model using a set of problem landscape
features linked to the performance achieved by the optimization algorithm.
However, these models are black-box with the only goal of achieving good
predictive performance, without providing explanations which landscape features
contribute the most to the prediction of the performance achieved by the
optimization algorithm. In this study, we investigate the expressiveness of
problem landscape features utilized by different supervised ML models in
automated algorithm performance prediction. The experimental results point out
that the selection of the supervised ML method is crucial, since different
supervised ML regression models utilize the problem landscape features
differently and there is no common pattern with regard to which landscape
features are the most informative.

essential for various problems in science, business, and statistics. Recently
proposed XOR-Stochastic Gradient Descent (XOR-SGD) provides a convergence rate
guarantee solving the constraints-free version of the problem by leveraging
XOR-Sampling. However, the task becomes more difficult when additional equality
and inequality constraints are needed to be satisfied. Here we propose XOR-PGD,
a novel algorithm based on Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) coupled with the
XOR sampler, which is guaranteed to solve the constrained stochastic convex
optimization problem still in linear convergence rate by choosing proper step
size. We show on both synthetic stochastic inventory management and real-world
road network design problems that the rate of constraints satisfaction of the
solutions optimized by XOR-PGD is $10\%$ more than the competing approaches in
a very large searching space. The improved XOR-PGD algorithm is demonstrated to
be more accurate and efficient than both XOR-SGD and SGD coupled with MCMC
based samplers. It is also shown to be more scalable with respect to the number
of samples and processor cores via experiments with large dimensions.

Liouville conformal field theory (CFT) with boundaries. We focus here on the
case of the annulus with two boundary insertions, each of which lies on the
different connected components of the boundary. In the course of proving the
bootstrap formula, we established several properties on the corresponding
annulus conformal blocks:
  1) we show that they converge everywhere on the spectral line and they are
continuous with respect to the spectrum and the primary weights.
  2) we relate them to their torus counterparts by rigorously implementing
Cardy's doubling trick for boundary CFT,
  3) we solve a conjecture of Martinec on the annulus partition function,
  4) we also extend the bootstrap formula to the one-point case.
  As an application of our bootstrap result, we give an exact formula for the
bosonic LQG partition function of the annulus when $\gamma\in (0,2)$. Our paper
serves as a key ingredient in the recent derivation of the random moduli for
the Brownian annulus by Ang, Remy, and Sun (2022). We also solve several other

Collaboration, JHEP11 (2020) 001] reveal a deficit of charged particle tracks
in events with higher $\Upsilon$(nS) states. This observation is suggested to
be a manifestation of the excited bottomonia suppression in $pp$ interactions.
Transverse mass ($m_{\mathrm{T}}$) scaling can be implied to check this
assumption in an independent way. The scaling has been observed for a wide
range of particle species in proton-proton collisions at various energies from
the SPS to RHIC and the LHC. The observed scaling is known to be different for
baryons and mesons, and this work presents a comprehensive study of the
$m_{\mathrm{T}}$-scaling of mesons at LHC energies with a focus on heavier
mesons. The study demonstrates patterns in the scaling properties of mesons,
which are related to the particle quark content. In particular, light species
and ground-state quarkonia obey the same scaling, whereas open-flavor particles
deviate from it because their spectra are significantly harder. The magnitude
of deviation depends on the flavor of the heaviest quark in the meson. By
extending the $m_{\mathrm{T}}$-scaling assumption to the excited bottomonia
states, it is observed that the measured cross sections of $\Upsilon$(2S) and
$\Upsilon$(3S) are reduced by factors of 1.6 and 2.4 compared to the
expectation from the scaling. This observation is consistent with recently
observed differences between the event-activity dependence of different
$\Upsilon$(nS) meson states.

Instead of learning cross-view mapping in a feedforward pass, we propose a
novel adversarial feedback GAN framework named PanoGAN with two key components:
an adversarial feedback module and a dual branch discrimination strategy.
First, the aerial image is fed into the generator to produce a target panorama
image and its associated segmentation map in favor of model training with
layout semantics. Second, the feature responses of the discriminator encoded by
our adversarial feedback module are fed back to the generator to refine the
intermediate representations, so that the generation performance is continually
improved through an iterative generation process. Third, to pursue
high-fidelity and semantic consistency of the generated panorama image, we
propose a pixel-segmentation alignment mechanism under the dual branch
discrimiantion strategy to facilitate cooperation between the generator and the
discriminator. Extensive experimental results on two challenging cross-view
image datasets show that PanoGAN enables high-quality panorama image generation
with more convincing details than state-of-the-art approaches. The source code

Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy. In this work, we compare these two entropies
through a medical application for predicting recurrence in patients with

peak amplitude is smaller than that of the big-big and small-small macroion
correlation peaks, which is unfamiliar for additive repulsive interactions.
Extracting optimal effective microion-averaged pair interactions between the
macroions, we find that on top of non-additive Yukawa-like repulsions an
additional shifted Gaussian attractive potential between the small macroions is
needed to accurately reproduce their correct pair correlations. For small
Coulomb couplings, the behavior is reproduced in a coarse-grained theory with
microion-averaged effective interactions between the macroions. However, the
accuracy of the theory deteriorates with increasing Coulomb coupling. We
emphasize the relevance of entropic interactions exerted by the microions on

Production of the fibers was investigated with iron oxide nanoparticles of

heat performance under clinical magnetic hyperthermia conditions. With 23 nm
nanocubes when included into the fibers, an arrangement in chains was obtained.
This linear configuration of magnetic nanoparticles resemble that of the

exhibited remarkable heating effects as the magnetosomes. Magnetic fiber
scaffolds showed excellent biocompatibility on fibroblast cells when missing
the chemotherapeutic agent and when not exposed to magnetic hyperthermia as
shown by viability assays. On the contrary, the fibers containing both magnetic

As here shown, on the doxorubicin sensitive cervical cancer cells, the

In particular, TransSleep adopts an attention-based multi-scale feature

estimate confidence scores for identifying confusing stages; and a context

the optimal smoothing factors are derived. This insightful analysis reveals
that the optimal relaxation parameters depend on mesh size and regularization
parameters, which was not investigated in literature. Second, we propose and
analyze a new mass-based Braess-Sarazin relaxation (BSR) scheme, which is
proven to provide smaller smoothing factors than the CJR scheme when $\alpha\ge
ch^4$ for a small constant $c$. Here $\alpha$ is the regularization parameter
and $h$ is the spatial mesh step size. These schemes are successfully extended
to control-constrained cases through the semi-smooth Newton method. Coarsening
by three or four with BSR is competitive with coarsening by two. Numerical
examples are presented to validate our theoretical outcomes. The proposed

technology needs of the HEP community. The authors of this whitepaper are
electronics and computer engineers and so, naturally, the arguments herein are
made from their perspective. However, these arguments are only strengthened by
the simple fact that they could also have been made from the perspective of
mechanical engineers, civil engineers or numerous other technologists. At the

$^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg has an major influence on neutron flux
in weak s-process nucleosynthesis path in low mass AGB stars and massive stars
of mass (M$\geq$ 10M$_\odot$). So the ratio rate of this two competing reaction
control the neutron flux in weak s-process nucleosynthesis. Various experiment
has been performed to study the properties of nuclear states of $^{26}$Mg to
evaluate rate of $^{22}$Ne+$\alpha$ reaction rate and corresponding rate from
these studies vary by up to a factor of 500 in the astrophysical relevant
temperature. The recent evaluation by Philip et al. of $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,
n)$^{25}$Mg reaction rate using most recent nuclear data of $^{26}$Mg from
number of sources shows similar result with previous estimation for
$^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg but got lower rate for
$^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction due to updated nuclear data. Also
Philip et al. suggested that rate based on full $R$-matrix modeling will
required to take into accounted the interference effects between distant levels
and sub-threshold resonance. In present work full $R$-matrix calculation has
been performed for $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,
$\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg reaction based on fitting the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,
n)$^{25}$Mg reaction data of Jaeger et al; in energy range 0.8 to 1.45 MeV and
updated nuclear data of $^{26}$Mg states. The $R$-matrix fitting for the
$^{22}$Ne($\alpha$, n)$^{25}$Mg reaction nicely explain experimental data in
0.8 to 1.45 MeV energy range by changing spin, parity of E$_x$ = 11.784 and
11.63 MeV states from 1$^-$ to 0$^+$.

statistical analysis of functions and shapes. While there are several
approaches available, a more recent approach based on Fisher-Rao metric and
square-root velocity functions (SRVFs) has been shown to have good performance.
However, this SRVF method has two limitations: (1) it is susceptible to over
alignment, i.e., alignment of noise as well as the signal, and (2) in case
there is additional information in form of landmarks, the original formulation
does not prescribe a way to incorporate that information. In this paper we
propose an extension that allows for incorporation of landmark information to
seek a compromise between matching curves and landmarks. This results in a soft
landmark alignment that pushes landmarks closer, without requiring their exact
overlays to finds a compromise between contributions from functions and
landmarks. The proposed method is demonstrated to be superior in certain
practical scenarios.

  superconducting resonators",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Superconducting resonators are now found in a broad range of applications
that require high-fidelity measurement of low-energy signals. A common feature
across almost all of these applications is the need for increased numbers of
resonators to further improve sensitivity, and the ability to read out large
numbers of resonators without the need for additional cryogenic complexity is a
primary motivation. One of the major limitations of current resonator arrays is
the observed scatter in the resonator frequencies when compared to the initial
design. Here we present recent progress toward identifying one of the dominant
underlying causes of resonator scatter, inductor line width fluctuation. We
designed and fabricated an array of lumped-element resonators with inductor
line width changing from 1.8um to 2.2um in step of 0.1um defined with
electron-beam lithography to probe and quantify the systematic variation of
resonance frequency across a 6-inch wafer. The resonators showed a linear
frequency shift of 20MHz (140FWHM) and 30MHz (214FWHM), respectively, as they
are connected to two different capacitors. This linear relationship matches our
theoretical prediction. The widely used MLA photon lithography facility for
MKID fabrication has a resolution on the order of 600nm, which could cause
frequency fluctuation on the order of 100MHz or 710FWHM.

operators of nonzero weight on $3$-Lie algebras and $3$-post-Lie algebras. A
3-post-Lie algebra consists of a 3-Lie algebra structure and a ternary
operation such that some compatibility conditions are satisfied. We show that a
relative Rota-Baxter operator of nonzero weight induces a $3$-post-Lie algebra
naturally. Conversely, a $3$-post-Lie algebra gives rise to a new 3-Lie
algebra, which is called the subadjacent 3-Lie algebra, and an action on the
original 3-Lie algebra. Then we construct an $L_\infty$-algebra whose
Maurer-Cartan elements are relative Rota-Baxter operators of nonzero weight.
Consequently, we obtain the twisted $L_\infty$-algebra that controls
deformations of a given relative Rota-Baxter operator of nonzero weight on
3-Lie algebras. Finally, we introduce a cohomology theory for a relative
Rota-Baxter operator of nonzero weight on $3$-Lie algebras and use the second
cohomology group to classify infinitesimal deformations.

function \(f(\eta)\), which has convergence problems when evaluating for higher
values of \(\eta\) due to a singularity present at \(\eta\approx-5.69\). In
this paper we are introducing an accurate solution to \(f(\eta)\) using
Taylor's series expansions with progressively shifted centers of
expansion(Leaping centers). Each series is solved as an IVP with the three
initial values computed from solution of the previous series, so the gap
between the centers of two consecutive expansions is selected from within the
convergence disc of the first series. The last series is formed such that it is
convergent for a reasonable high \(\eta\) value needed for implementing the
boundary condition at infinity. The present methodology uses Newton-Raphson
method to compute the value of the unknown initial condition viz. \(f''(0)\) in
an iterative manner. Benchmark accurate results of different parameters of flat
plate boundary layer with no slip and slip boundary conditions have been
reported in this paper.

link states are assumed to be random variables drawn from unknown
distributions, independent and identically distributed across links and time.
This model has attracted a growing interest recently in cognitive radio
networks and adaptive communication systems. In such networks, devices are
cognitive in the sense of learning the link states and updating the
transmission parameters to allow efficient resource utilization. This model
contrasts sharply with the vast literature on routing algorithms that assumed
complete knowledge about the link state means. The goal is to design an
algorithm that learns online optimal paths for data transmissions to maximize
the network throughput while attaining low path cost over flows in the network.
We develop a novel Online Learning for Shortest path and Backpressure (OLSB)
algorithm to achieve this goal. We analyze the performance of OLSB rigorously
and show that it achieves a logarithmic regret with time, defined as the loss
of an algorithm as compared to a genie that has complete knowledge about the
link state means. We further evaluate the performance of OLSB numerically via
extensive simulations, which support the theoretical findings and demonstrate
its high efficiency.

rapidly moved over the Internet. Social media and community forums that allow
people to discuss and express their opinions are becoming platforms for the
spreading of hate messages. Many countries have developed laws to avoid online
hate speech. They hold the companies that run the social media responsible for
their failure to eliminate hate speech. But as online content continues to
grow, so does the spread of hate speech However, manual analysis of hate speech
on online platforms is infeasible due to the huge amount of data as it is
expensive and time consuming. Thus, it is important to automatically process
the online user contents to detect and remove hate speech from online media.
Many recent approaches suffer from interpretability problem which means that it
can be difficult to understand why the systems make the decisions they do.
Through this work, some solutions for the problem of automatic detection of
hate messages were proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na\""ive
Bayes algorithms. This achieved near state-of-the-art performance while being
simpler and producing more easily interpretable decisions than other methods.
Empirical evaluation of this technique has resulted in a classification
accuracy of approximately 99% and 50% for SVM and NB respectively over the test
set.

network state parameters like data rate and packet loss values. Our proposed
solution vQoS GAN (video Quality of Service Generative Adversarial Network) can

network algorithm. A robust and unique design of deep learning network model
has been trained with the video data along with data rate and packet loss class

However, when the number of communicating cars increases, the transmission
quality may be significantly degraded due to too high occupancy radio of the
used frequency band. In this paper, we concentrate on the autonomous
vehicle-platooning use-case, where intra-platoon communication is done in the
dynamically selected frequency band, other than nominally devoted for such
purposes. The carrier selection is done in a flexible manner with the support
of the context database located at the roadside unit (edge of wireless
communication infrastructure). However, as the database delivers only context
information to the platoons' leaders, the final decision is made separately by
the individual platoons, following the suggestions made by the artificial
intelligence algorithms. In this work, we concentrate on a lightweight
Q-learning solution, that could be successfully implemented in each car for
