of functions belonging to certain classes of symbolically continuous functions.
We do this for an expanding interval map with countably many branches, which we
assume can be coded by a topologically mixing countable Markov shift. This
generalises previous work on expanding maps with finitely many branches, and
expanding maps with countably many branches where the coding is assumed to be
the full shift. When the infimum of the derivative on each branch approaches
infinity in the limit, we can directly generalise the results of the full
countable shift case. However, when this does not hold, we show that there can
be different behaviour, in particular in cases where the coding has finite
topological entropy.

decreases along the direction of gradient flows, so it is rather significant
for numerical methods to preserve this intrinsic structure. In order to
guarantee the energy dissipation, various numerical schemes have been developed
and among them, a simple but vital approach is implicit-explicit (IMEX)
Runge-Kutta (RK) method. In this paper we prove that a class of high-order
IMEX-RK schemes unconditionally preserve the energy dissipation law for
phase-field models with Lipschitz nonlinearity. This is the first work to prove
that a high-order linear scheme can guarantee the dissipation of the original
energy unconditionally. We also obtain the error estimate to show the
convergence and accuracy. In the end, we give some IMEX RK schemes as examples.

the past decade as solutions to the small-scale puzzles of astrophysics. Though
there are different implementations of dark matter (DM) self-interactions in
N-body codes of structure formation, there has not been a systematic study to
compare the predictions of these different implementations. We investigate the
implementation of dark matter self-interactions in two simulation codes: Gizmo
and Arepo. We begin with identical initial conditions for an isolated $10^{10}$
M$_\odot$ dark matter halo and investigate the evolution of the density and
velocity dispersion profiles in Gizmo and Arepo for SIDM cross-section over
mass of 1, 5, and 50 $\rm cm^2 g^{-1}$. Our tests are restricted to the core
expansion phase where the core density decreases and core radius increases with
time. We find better than 30% agreement between the codes for the density
profile in this phase of evolution, with the agreement improving at higher
resolution. We find that varying code-specific SIDM parameters changes the
central halo density by less than 10% outside of the convergence radius. We
argue that SIDM core formation is robust across the two different schemes and
conclude that these codes can reliably differentiate between cross-sections of
1, 5, and 50 $\rm cm^2 g^{-1}$ but finer distinctions would require further
investigation.

Directional detectors improve sensitivity to WIMP DM despite the irreducible

detection in a high-density target material. A detector of this type operates
in a hybrid mode. The WIMP or neutrino-induced nuclear recoil is detected using
real-time charge, phonon, or photon collection. The directional signal,
however, is imprinted as a durable sub-micron damage track in the lattice

defined in an InSb nanowire. While characterizing the inter-dot tunnel
couplings, the measured dispersive signal depends on the electron charge
occupancy, as well as on the amplitude and orientation of the external magnetic
field. The dispersive signal is mostly insensitive to the external field
orientation when a DQD is occupied by a total odd number of electrons. For a
DQD occupied by a total even number of electrons, the dispersive signal is
reduced when the finite external magnetic field aligns with the effective
$\textbf{B}_{SO}$ orientation. This fact enables the identification of
$\textbf{B}_{SO}$ orientations for different DQD electron occupancies. The
$\textbf{B}_{SO}$ orientation varies drastically between charge transitions,
and is generally neither perpendicular to the nanowire nor in the chip plane.
Moreover, $\textbf{B}_{SO}$ is similar for pairs of transitions involving the
same valence orbital, and varies between such pairs. Our work demonstrates the
practicality of DGS in characterizing spin-orbit interactions in quantum dot
systems, without requiring any current flow through the device.

$1/2^+$ halo ground-state and $1/2^-$ excited-state of $^{11}$Be - both states
less than 1 MeV from the first neutron-decay threshold. Numerous additional
examples arise in reactions of asymmetric $p$- and $sd$-shell nuclei. The
importance of this weak residue binding upon calculated single-nucleon removal
reaction cross sections is quantified by means of model calculations that
neglect or include the dissociation degree of freedom of the residual nuclei.
The calculated removal-reaction cross sections for two representative $p$-shell
projectiles indicate that an explicit treatment of these residue break-up
effects is unnecessary and that the differences between the break-up and no
break-up calculations are small provided a consistent description of the
residue structure and density is used.

image analysis due to their success in classification, segmentation, and
detection challenges. A principal challenge in large-scale deployment of DNNs
in neuroimage analysis is the potential for shifts in signal-to-noise ratio,
contrast, resolution, and presence of artifacts from site to site due to
variances in scanners and acquisition protocols. DNNs are famously susceptible
to these distribution shifts in computer vision. Currently, there are no
benchmarking platforms or frameworks to assess the robustness of new and
existing models to specific distribution shifts in MRI, and accessible
multi-site benchmarking datasets are still scarce or task-specific. To address
these limitations, we propose ROOD-MRI: a platform for benchmarking the
Robustness of DNNs to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, corruptions, and
artifacts in MRI. The platform provides modules for generating benchmarking
datasets using transforms that model distribution shifts in MRI,
implementations of newly derived benchmarking metrics for image segmentation,
and examples for using the methodology with new models and tasks. We apply our
methodology to hippocampus, ventricle, and white matter hyperintensity
segmentation in several large studies, providing the hippocampus dataset as a
publicly available benchmark. By evaluating modern DNNs on these datasets, we
demonstrate that they are highly susceptible to distribution shifts and
corruptions in MRI. We show that while data augmentation strategies can
substantially improve robustness to OOD data for anatomical segmentation tasks,
modern DNNs using augmentation still lack robustness in more challenging
lesion-based segmentation tasks. We finally benchmark U-Nets and
transformer-based models, finding consistent differences in robustness to
particular classes of transforms across architectures.

analysis to hold and to ensure Galilean invariance in the divergence cleaning
technique, the GLM-MHD system requires the use of non-conservative terms.
  Traditionally, entropy-stable DG discretizations have used a collocated nodal
variant of the DG method, also known as the discontinuous Galerkin spectral
element method (DGSEM) on Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) points. Recently, Chan
et al. (""Efficient Entropy Stable Gauss Collocation Methods"". SIAM -2019)
presented an entropy-stable DGSEM scheme that uses Legendre-Gauss points
(instead of LGL points) for conservation laws. Our main contribution is to
extend the discretization technique of Chan et al. to the non-conservative
GLM-MHD system.
  We provide a numerical verification of the entropy behavior and convergence
properties of our novel scheme on 3D curvilinear meshes. Moreover, we test the
robustness and accuracy of our scheme with a magneto-hydrodynamic
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem. The numerical experiments suggest that
the entropy-stable DGSEM on Gauss points for the GLM-MHD system is more
accurate than the LGL counterpart.

this can be very expensive as the number of human annotations required would
grow quadratically with $k$. In this work, we introduce Active Evaluation, a
framework to efficiently identify the top-ranked system by actively choosing

extensive experiments with 13 dueling bandits algorithms on 13 NLG evaluation
datasets spanning 5 tasks and show that the number of human annotations can be
reduced by 80%. To further reduce the number of human annotations, we propose
model-based dueling bandit algorithms which combine automatic evaluation
metrics with human evaluations. Specifically, we eliminate sub-optimal systems
even before the human annotation process and perform human evaluations only on
test examples where the automatic metric is highly uncertain. This reduces the
number of human annotations required further by 89%. In effect, we show that
identifying the top-ranked system requires only a few hundred human
annotations, which grow linearly with $k$. Lastly, we provide practical
recommendations and best practices to identify the top-ranked system

After introducing the model and notations, we define the adaptive group LASSO

the asymptotic normality.
  Afterwards, the results are generalized by considering the asymmetric
$L_q$-norm loss function. The theoretical results are obtained in several cases
with respect to the number of variable groups. This number can be fixed or
dependent on the sample size $n$, with the possibility that it is of the same
order as $n$. Note that these new estimators allow us to consider weaker
assumptions on the data and on the model errors than the usual ones. Simulation
study demonstrates the competitive performance of the proposed penalized
expectile regression, especially when the samples size is close to the number
of explanatory variables and model errors are asymmetrical. An application on
air pollution data is considered.

number of unseen species and coverages of prevalences have emerged over the
past three decades for being the objects of numerous studies, both in methods
and applications, mostly within the field of biological sciences but also in
machine learning, electrical engineering and information theory. In this paper,
we present an overview of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) inference for such three
SSPs under the popular Pitman--Yor process (PYP) prior: i) we introduce each
SSP in the classical (frequentist) nonparametric framework, and review its
posterior analyses in the BNP framework; ii) we improve on computation and
interpretability of existing posterior distributions, typically expressed
through complicated combinatorial numbers, by establishing novel posterior
representations in terms of simple compound Binomial and Hypergeometric
distributions. The critical question of estimating the discount and scale
parameters of the PYP prior is also considered and investigated, establishing a
general property of Bayesian consistency with respect to the hierarchical Bayes
and empirical Bayes approaches, that is: the discount parameter can be always
estimated consistently, whereas the scale parameter cannot be estimated
consistently, thus advising caution in posterior inference. We conclude our
work by discussing other SSPs, and presenting some emerging generalizations of
SSPs, mostly in biological sciences, which deal with ""feature-sampling""

Also, video conference applications, boomed during the pandemic, include such
filters.
  Such filters may destroy biometric features that would allow person
recognition or even detection of the face itself, even if such commodity
applications are not necessarily used to compromise facial systems. This could
also affect subsequent investigations like crimes in social media, where
automatic analysis is usually necessary given the amount of information posted
in social sites or stored in devices or cloud repositories.
  To help in counteracting such issues, we contribute with a database of facial
images that includes several manipulations. It includes image enhancement
filters (which mostly modify contrast and lightning) and augmented reality
filters that incorporate items like animal noses or glasses. Additionally,
images with sunglasses are processed with a reconstruction network trained to
learn to reverse such modifications. This is because obfuscating the eye region
has been observed in the literature to have the highest impact on the accuracy
of face detection or recognition.
  We start from the popular Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database, to which
we apply different modifications, generating 8 datasets. Each dataset contains
4,324 images of size 64 x 64, with a total of 34,592 images. The use of a
public and widely employed face dataset allows for replication and comparison.

since their ages can be reliably estimated from atmospheric parameters. Based
on the GALAH survey, we use the Yale Rotation Evolution Code to determine ages
of 2926 MSTO stars with mean age uncertainty $\sim$10\% considering the
variation of C and O abundances. Ages of CO-poor stars are systematically
affected by $\sim$10\% due to the C and O abundances, globally shifting to
$\sim$0.5 Gyr older compared to the results using solar metal-mixture. Of the
stars with \mbox{[Fe/H] $\sim$0.3-0.5} or \mbox{[O/Fe]~$\leq$~-0.25}, many have
fractional age differences~$\geq$~20\%, and even reach up to 36\%. The
age-metallicity relation appears to possibly exist two distinct sequences: a
young sequence of stars with age mostly $<$ 7 Gyr, and a relatively older
sequence of stars with age mostly $>$ 7 Gyr, overlapping at 5 Gyr
$\leq$~age~$\leq$ 7 Gyr. Moreover, the trends of abundances to age ratios show
two corresponding sequences, especially in [O/Fe]-age plane. We also find that
[Y/Mg] is a good chemical clock in disk populations. The young sequence and the
old sequence can not be separated based on chemistry or kinematics, therefore
stellar age is an important parameter to distinguish these two sequences in our
sample.

angular-selective active filter for charged particles. The motivation for the
setup arises from the need to distinguish background electrons from signal
electrons in a spectrometer of MAC-E filter type. While a large fraction of the
background electrons exhibit predominantly small angles relative to the
magnetic guiding field (corresponding to a low amount of kinetic energy in the
motion component transverse to the field lines, in the following referred to as
transverse energy) and pass the filter mostly unhindered, signal electrons from
an isotropically emitting source interact with the active filter and are
detected. The concept is demonstrated using a microchannel plate (MCP) as an
active filter element. When correctly aligned with the magnetic field,
electrons with a small transverse energy pass the channels of the MCP without
interaction while electrons with large transverse energies hit the channel
walls and trigger an avalanche of secondary electrons that is subsequently
detected. Due to several drawbacks of MCPs for an actual transverse energy
filter, an alternative detection technique using microstructured Si-PIN diodes
is proposed.

  Image Sensors",,"IEEE Sensors Journal, 2023",,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The one-bit quanta image sensor is a photon-counting device that produces
binary measurements where each bit represents the presence or absence of a
photon. In the presence of read noise, the sensor quantizes the analog voltage
into the binary bits using a threshold value $q$. The average number of ones in
the bitstream is known as the bit-density and is often the sufficient
statistics for signal estimation. An intriguing phenomenon is observed when the
quanta exposure is at the unity and the threshold is $q = 0.5$. The bit-density
demonstrates a complete insensitivity as long as the read noise level does not
exceeds a certain limit. In other words, the bit density stays at a constant
independent of the amount of read noise. This paper provides a mathematical
explanation of the phenomenon by deriving conditions under which the phenomenon
happens. It was found that the insensitivity holds when some forms of the
symmetry of the underlying Poisson-Gaussian distribution holds.

however, the collective behavior observed in these collisions shows a hint of
hot-nuclear-matter effects. The identified-particle spectra, especially the
$\phi$ mesons which contain strange and antistrange quarks and have a
relatively small hadronic-interaction cross section, are a good tool to study
these effects. The PHENIX experiment has measured $\phi$ mesons in a specific
set of small collision systems $p$$+$Al, $p$$+$Au, and $^3$He$+$Au, as well as
$d$$+$Au [Phys. Rev. C {\bf 83}, 024909 (2011)], at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV.
The transverse-momentum spectra and nuclear-modification factors are presented
and compared to theoretical-model predictions. The comparisons with different
calculations suggest that quark-gluon plasma may be formed in these small
collision systems at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. However, the volume and the
lifetime of the produced medium may be insufficient for observing
strangeness-enhancement and jet-quenching effects. Comparison with calculations
suggests that the main production mechanisms of $\phi$ mesons at midrapidity
may be different in $p$$+$Al versus $p/d/$$^3$He$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV. While thermal quark recombination seems to dominate
in $p/d/$$^3$He$+$Au collisions, fragmentation seems to be the main production
mechanism in $p$$+$Al collisions.

phase must be highly efficient. In contrast, observations of low-mass post-CE
binaries indicate energy transfer during the CE phase must be highly
inefficient. Convection, a process present in low-mass and high-mass stars,
naturally explains this dichotomy. Using observations of Wolf-Rayet binaries,
we study the effects of convection and radiative losses on the predicted final
separations of high-mass common envelopes. Despite robust convection in massive
stars, the effect is minimal as the orbit decays well before convection can
transport the liberated orbital energy to the surface. In low-mass systems,
convective transport occurs faster then the orbit decays, allowing the system
to radiatively cool thereby lowering the efficiency. The inclusion of
convection reproduces observations of low-mass and high-mass binaries and
remains a necessary ingredient for determining outcomes of common envelopes.

to succeed at the task to a varying degree. Most importantly, we show that this
performance pertains even on signs unobserved during training.

specifically designed for high-bandwidth laser-frequency stabilization and
wideband frequency modulation with a flat transfer function. It consists of a
dedicated current source and an impedance-matching circuit both placed close to
the laser diode. The transfer behaviour of the system is analysed under
realistic conditions employing an external-cavity diode laser (ECDL) system. We
achieve a phase lag less than 90$\deg$ up to 25 MHz and a gain flatness of
$\pm$ 3 dB in the frequency range of DC to 100 MHz while the passive stability
of the laser system is not impaired. The potential of the presented current
modulation scheme is demonstrated in an optical phase-locked-loop between two
ECDL systems resulting in an improved phase noise of 42 mrad$_{rms}$. The
design files are available as an open-source project.

quantum state. For a sudden quench to resonant interactions between particles
we construct a new class of analytical scaling solutions for the time evolved
wave function with a complex scale parameter. These solutions determine the
exact dynamical scaling of observables such as the pair correlation function,
the contact and the fidelity. We give explicit examples of the nonequilibrium
dynamics for two trapped fermions or bosons quenched to unitarity, for ideal
Bose polarons, and for resonantly interacting, Borromean three-body systems.
These solutions reveal universal scaling properties of interacting many-body
systems that arise from the buildup of correlations at short times after the
quench.

  Dynamics","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: To minimize eddy-current artifacts in periodic pulse sequences with
balanced gradient moments as, e.g., used for quantitative MRI.
  Theory and Methods: Eddy current artifacts in balanced sequences result from
large jumps in k-space. In quantitative MRI, one often samples some spin
dynamics repeatedly while acquiring different parts of k-space. We swap
individual k-space lines between different repetitions in order to minimize
jumps within each repetition. This reordering can be formulated as a travelling
salesman problem and we tackle the discrete optimization with a simulated
annealing algorithm.
  Results: The proposed approach is highly effective at minimizing the change
of the readout direction of a 3D koosh-ball trajectory. This decreases the
eddy-current induced perturbations of the magnetization and reduces artifacts
in the derived parameter maps, as demonstrated in the example of a hybrid-state
free precession sequence.
  Conclusion: Beyond this example application, we believe that the approach can
be used for most k-space trajectories, other quantitative MRI methods, as well
as for cine cardiac imaging.

long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment with a primary physics goal of
observing neutrino and antineutrino oscillation patterns to precisely measure
the parameters governing long-baseline neutrino oscillation in a single
experiment, and to test the three-flavor paradigm. DUNE's design has been
developed by a large, international collaboration of scientists and engineers
to have unique capability to measure neutrino oscillation as a function of
energy in a broadband beam, to resolve degeneracy among oscillation parameters,
and to control systematic uncertainty using the exquisite imaging capability of
massive LArTPC far detector modules and an argon-based near detector. DUNE's
neutrino oscillation measurements will unambiguously resolve the neutrino mass
ordering and provide the sensitivity to discover CP violation in neutrinos for
a wide range of possible values of $\delta_{CP}$. DUNE is also uniquely
sensitive to electron neutrinos from a galactic supernova burst, and to a broad
range of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), including nucleon decays.
DUNE is anticipated to begin collecting physics data with Phase I, an initial
experiment configuration consisting of two far detector modules and a minimal
suite of near detector components, with a 1.2 MW proton beam. To realize its
extensive, world-leading physics potential requires the full scope of DUNE be
completed in Phase II. The three Phase II upgrades are all necessary to achieve
DUNE's physics goals: (1) addition of far detector modules three and four for a
total FD fiducial mass of at least 40 kt, (2) upgrade of the proton beam power
from 1.2 MW to 2.4 MW, and (3) replacement of the near detector's temporary
muon spectrometer with a magnetized, high-pressure gaseous argon TPC and
calorimeter.

learning in the recent past. In particular, a distinction between aleatoric and

to the learner's (lack of) knowledge and appears to be especially difficult to
measure and quantify. In this paper, we analyse a recent proposal based on the
idea of a second-order learner, which yields predictions in the form of
distributions over probability distributions. While standard (first-order)
learners can be trained to predict accurate probabilities, namely by minimising
suitable loss functions on sample data, we show that loss minimisation does not
work for second-order predictors: The loss functions proposed for inducing such
predictors do not incentivise the learner to represent its epistemic

trustworthy AI systems. Most recent studies in visual reasoning are dedicated
to improving the accuracy of predicted answers, and less attention is paid to
explaining the rationales behind the decisions. As a result, they commonly take
advantage of spurious biases instead of actually reasoning on the
visual-textual data, and have yet developed the capability to explain their
decision making by considering key information from both modalities. This paper
aims to close the gap from three distinct perspectives: first, we define a new
type of multi-modal explanations that explain the decisions by progressively
traversing the reasoning process and grounding keywords in the images. We
develop a functional program to sequentially execute different reasoning steps
and construct a new dataset with 1,040,830 multi-modal explanations. Second, we
identify the critical need to tightly couple important components across the
visual and textual modalities for explaining the decisions, and propose a novel
explanation generation method that explicitly models the pairwise
correspondence between words and regions of interest. It improves the visual
grounding capability by a considerable margin, resulting in enhanced
interpretability and reasoning performance. Finally, with our new data and
method, we perform extensive analyses to study the effectiveness of our
explanation under different settings, including multi-task learning and

migration induced by an outer companion. Precise determination of the orbital
architecture of such systems is critical to constraining their dynamical
history and evaluating the role of delayed migration in the exoplanet
population. To this purpose we analyzed the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) signal of
GJ436 b in two transits - recently observed with ESPRESSO - using three
different techniques. The high level of precision achieved in radial velocity
(RV) measurements allows us to detect the deviation from the Keplerian orbit,
despite the slow rotation of the M dwarf host (vsini = 272.0+40.0-34.0 m/s),
and to measure the sky-projected obliquity ($\lambda$ =
102.5+17.2-18.5$^{\circ}$). The Reloaded RM technique, which allows the stellar
RV field along the transit chord to be analyzed, yields $\lambda$ =
107.5+23.6-19.3$^{\circ}$ and vsini = 292.9+41.9-49.9 m/s. The RM Revolutions
technique, which allows us to fit the spectral profiles from all
planet-occulted regions together, yields $\lambda$ = 114.1+22.8-17.8$^{\circ}$
and vsini = 300.5+45.9-57.0 m/s. The consistent results between these three
techniques, and with published results from HARPS/HARPS-N data, confirm the
polar orbit of GJ436b and support the hypothesis that its origin lies in Kozai
migration. Results from a joint RM Revolutions analysis of the ESPRESSO, HARPS,

retinal field of view compared to traditional fundus photography. Previous
studies showed that deep learning (DL) models are effective for detecting
retinal disease in UWF images, but primarily considered individual diseases
under less-than-realistic conditions (excluding images with other diseases,
artefacts, comorbidities, or borderline cases; and balancing healthy and
diseased images) and did not systematically investigate which regions of the
UWF images are relevant for disease detection. We first improve on the state of
the field by proposing a DL model that can recognise multiple retinal diseases
under more realistic conditions. We then use global explainability methods to
identify which regions of the UWF images the model generally attends to. Our
model performs very well, separating between healthy and diseased retinas with
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9206 on an internal test set, and an AUC of
0.9841 on a challenging, external test set. When diagnosing specific diseases,
the model attends to regions where we would expect those diseases to occur. We
further identify the posterior pole as the most important region in a purely
data-driven fashion. Surprisingly, 10% of the image around the posterior pole
is sufficient for achieving comparable performance to having the full images

dedicated signatures in the inner detector and the muon spectrometer, namely a

that both the HL-LHC and FCC-hh can be sensitive to small active-sterile mixing

accuracy of forecasting, where we take the situation in the Netherlands during
and after the first wave of transmission in 2020 as a case study. We assess the
quality of forecasting on the detailed level of municipalities, instead of on a
nation-wide level. To model transmissions, we use a simple mobility-enhanced
SEIR compartmental model with subpopulations corresponding to the Dutch
municipalities. We use commuter information to quantify mobility, and develop a
method based on maximum likelihood estimation to determine the other relevant
parameters. We show that taking inter-regional mobility into account generally
leads to an improvement in forecast quality. However, at times when policies
are in place that aim to reduce contacts or travel, this improvement is very
small.

from single-label annotations only. We show that adding a consistency loss,
ensuring that the predictions of the network are consistent over consecutive
training epochs, is a simple yet effective method to train multi-label

spatially, by ensuring consistency of the spatial feature maps produced over
consecutive training epochs, maintaining per-class running-average heatmaps for

improves the multi-label mAP of the classifiers. In addition, we show that this

are close to thermodynamic equilibrium and growth is slow. To understand the
community structure in these energy-limited environments, we developed a
microbial community consumer-resource model incorporating energetic and
thermodynamic constraints on an interconnected metabolic network. The central
ingredient of the model is product inhibition, meaning that microbial growth
may be limited not only by depletion of metabolic substrates but also by
accumulation of products. We demonstrate that these additional constraints on
microbial growth cause a convergence in the structure and function of the
community metabolic network -- independent of species composition and
biochemical details -- providing a possible explanation for convergence of
community function despite taxonomic variation observed in many natural and

Golden used it to show that the classical free energy is less than the quantum

operators, notably the operators of interest in quantum mechanics, $H=\Delta$
or $H= -\sqrt{-\Delta +m}$ and $K=$ potential, $Tr\, e^{H+(1-u)K}e^{uK}$ is a
monotone increasing function of the parameter $u$ for $0\leq u \leq 1$. Our

often the phenomenon of ``stutter'' is observed, where the number of repeated

distance to be suitable for forensic applications where DNA sequence similarity
is of interest, a generalized string edit distance is defined that accommodates
the addition or deletion of whole motifs in addition to single-nucleotide

the next decade, also taking into account the current discordances between the
different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the
Hubble constant $H_0$, the $\sigma_8$--$S_8$ tension, and other less
statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in
part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of
accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological
scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the
standard model. In this paper, we focus on the $5.0\,\sigma$ tension between
the {\it Planck} CMB estimate of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the SH0ES
collaboration measurements. After showing the $H_0$ evaluations made from
different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a
few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and
discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus
on the tension of the {\it Planck} CMB data with weak lensing measurements and
redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density $\Omega_m$, and
the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure ($\sigma_8,f\sigma_8$). We
list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we
discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single
model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide
range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level
lower than the $H_0$--$S_8$ tensions which may also constitute hints towards
new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can
collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals.[Abridged]

  Via this new class of simple drawings, we show that every simple drawing of
the complete graph with $n$ vertices contains $\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$
pairwise disjoint edges and a plane path of length $\Omega(\frac{\log n }{\log

denser messages in the sparse matrix-block vector multiplication kernel.

demonstrate the feasibility of unsupervised contrastive learning for SNNs. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on prevailing neuromorphic vision benchmarks

MIGHTEE Survey Early Science data. The high sensitivity of MeerKAT allows us to
detect galaxies spanning more than 4 orders of magnitude in HI mass, ranging
from dwarf galaxies to massive spirals, and including all morphological types.
This is the first time the relation has been explored on a blind homogeneous
data set which extends over a previously unexplored redshift range of $0 < z <
0.084$, i.e. a period of around one billion years in cosmic time. The sample
follows the same tight logarithmic relation derived from previous work, between
the diameter ($D_{\rm HI}$) and the mass ($M_{\rm HI}$) of HI discs. We measure
a slope of $0.501\pm 0.008$, an intercept of $-3.252^{+0.073}_{-0.074}$, and an
observed scatter of $0.057$ dex. For the first time, we quantify the intrinsic
scatter of $0.054 \pm 0.003$ dex (${\sim} 10 \%$), which provides a constraint
for cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. We derive the
relation as a function of galaxy type and find that their intrinsic scatters
and slopes are consistent within the errors. We also calculate the $D_{\rm HI}
- M_{\rm HI}$ relation for two redshift bins and do not find any evidence for
evolution with redshift. These results suggest that over a period of one
billion years in lookback time, galaxy discs have not undergone significant
evolution in their gas distribution and mean surface mass density, indicating a
lack of dependence on both morphological type and redshift.

are based on detecting the nanoscopic charge compensation current (switching

various surface and bulk limited mechanisms, leakage currents commonly appear
during such measurements, which are frequently subtracted using the device I-V
characteristic by employing positive-up-negative-down (PUND) measurement
scheme. By performing nanoscopic switching current measurements on a commonly

prone to large errors in the polarization estimation on ferro-resistive
samples, due to current background subtraction issues. Especially, when
ferro-resistive behavior is associated with the polarization reversal of the
ferroelectric thin film, background current subtraction is not accurate due to
the mismatch of the I-V characteristics for the two polarization states. We

in synthetic \fe\ images. These dots in simulation show distinct Doppler

10 \kms\ is followed by a blueshift of similar or higher magnitude. The
synthetic images of \oxy\ and \siiv\ lines, which represent transition region

to 100 \kms) than that in \fe\ lines. Our observation and simulation results,
together with the field geometry of dots in the simulation, suggest that most
dots in emerging flux regions form in the lower solar atmosphere (at $\approx$1
Mm) by magnetic reconnection between emerging and pre-existing/emerged magnetic
field. Some dots might be manifestations of magneto-acoustic shocks through the

systems, which are beyond second order in $\lambda$, are not captured by such
tools. Moreover, if the leading order in the studied effect is
higher-than-quadratic in $\lambda$, a second-order description fundamentally
fails, even at weak coupling. Here, using the reaction coordinate (RC) quantum
master equation framework, we are able to investigate and classify
higher-than-second order transport mechanisms. This technique, which relies on
the redefinition of the system-environment boundary, allows for the effects of
system-bath coupling to be included to high orders. We study steady-state heat
current beyond second-order in two models: The generalized spin-boson model
with non-commuting system-bath operators and a three-level ladder system. In
the latter model heat enters in one transition and it is extracted from a
different one. Crucially, we identify two transport pathways: (i) System's
current, where heat conduction is mediated by transitions in the system, with
the heat current scaling as $j_q \propto \lambda^2$ to lowest order in
$\lambda$. (ii) Inter-bath current, with the thermal baths directly exchanging
energy between them, facilitated by the bridging quantum system. To the lowest
order in $\lambda$, this current scales as $j_q \propto \lambda^4$. These
mechanisms are uncovered and examined using numerical and analytical tools. We
contend that the RC mapping brings, already at the level of the mapped

Minor changes",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The classical Cheeger's inequality relates the edge conductance $\phi$ of a
graph and the second smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ of the Laplacian matrix.
Recently, Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti discovered a Cheeger-type inequality
$\psi^2 / \log |V| \lesssim \lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ connecting the vertex
expansion $\psi$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ and the maximum reweighted second
smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2^*$ of the Laplacian matrix.
  In this work, we first improve their result to $\psi^2 / \log d \lesssim
\lambda_2^* \lesssim \psi$ where $d$ is the maximum degree in $G$, which is
optimal assuming the small-set expansion conjecture. Also, the improved result
holds for weighted vertex expansion, answering an open question by
Olesker-Taylor and Zanetti. Building on this connection, we then develop a new
spectral theory for vertex expansion. We discover that several interesting
generalizations of Cheeger inequalities relating edge conductances and
eigenvalues have a close analog in relating vertex expansions and reweighted
eigenvalues. These include an analog of Trevisan's result on bipartiteness, an
analog of higher order Cheeger's inequality, and an analog of improved
Cheeger's inequality.
  Finally, inspired by this connection, we present negative evidence to the
$0/1$-polytope edge expansion conjecture by Mihail and Vazirani. We construct
$0/1$-polytopes whose graphs have very poor vertex expansion. This implies that
the fastest mixing time to the uniform distribution on the vertices of these
$0/1$-polytopes is almost linear in the graph size. This does not provide a
counterexample to the conjecture, but this is in contrast with known positive
results which proved poly-logarithmic mixing time to the uniform distribution
on the vertices of subclasses of $0/1$-polytopes.

state-estimation, or expert demonstrations, we consistently outperform
supervised encoders by up to 80% absolute success rate, sometimes even matching

requires new techniques and tools. In this paper, we present an automatic code,
Spectroscopic Analysis Tool for intEgraL fieLd unIt daTacubEs, SATELLITE,
designed to fully explore such capability in the characterization of extended
objects, such as planetary nebulae, H II regions, galaxies, etc. SATELLITE
carries out 1D and 2D spectroscopic analysis through a number of pseudo-slits
that simulate slit spectrometry, as well as emission line imaging. The 1D
analysis permits direct comparison of the integral field unit (IFU) data with
previous studies based on long-slit spectroscopy, while the 2D analysis allows
the exploration of physical properties in both spatial directions. Interstellar
extinction, electron temperatures and densities, ionic abundances from
collisionally excited lines, total elemental abundances and ionization
correction factors are computed employing the Pyneb package. A Monte Carlo
approach is implemented in the code to compute the uncertainties for all the
physical parameters. SATELLITE provides a powerful tool to extract physical
information from IFS observations in an automatic and user configurable way.
The capabilities and performance of SATELLITE are demonstrated by means of a
comparison between the results obtained from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE) data of the planetary nebula NGC 7009 with the results obtained
from long-slit and IFU data available in the literature. The SATELLITE
characterization of NGC 6778 based on MUSE data is also presented.

being vastly overparameterized, which of their assumptions are needed to
capture the qualitative phenomena of generalization in the real world? On one
hand, we find that most theoretical analyses fall short of capturing these
qualitative phenomena even for kernel regression, when applied to kernels
derived from large-scale neural networks (e.g., ResNet-50) and real data (e.g.,
CIFAR-100). On the other hand, we find that the classical GCV estimator (Craven
and Wahba, 1978) accurately predicts generalization risk even in such
overparameterized settings. To bolster this empirical finding, we prove that
the GCV estimator converges to the generalization risk whenever a local random
matrix law holds. Finally, we apply this random matrix theory lens to explain
why pretrained representations generalize better as well as what factors govern
scaling laws for kernel regression. Our findings suggest that random matrix
theory, rather than just being a toy model, may be central to understanding the
properties of neural representations in practice.

size of the sound horizon at recombination, is precisely determined by CMB
experiments. Measuring the apparent size of the BAO scale imprinted in the
clustering of galaxies gives us a direct estimate of the angular-diameter
distance and the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift. The BAO feature is
damped by non-linear structure formation, which reduces the precision with
which we can infer the BAO scale from standard galaxy clustering analysis
methods. Many methods to undo this damping via the so-called BAO reconstruction
have so far been proposed; however, they all rely on backward modeling. In this
paper, we present the first results of BAO inference from rest-frame halo
catalogs using forward modeling combined with the EFT likelihood, in the case
where the initial phases of the density field are fixed. We show that the
remaining systematic bias is less than 2% when we consider cutoff values of
$\Lambda \leq 0.25 \,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for all halo samples considered, and
below 1% and consistent with zero for all but the most highly biased samples.
We also demonstrate that, when compared to the standard power spectrum
likelihood approach under the same assumption of fixed phases, the 1$\sigma$
errors associated to the field level inference of the BAO scale are 1.1 to 3.3
times smaller, depending on the value of the cutoff and the halo sample. Our
analysis therefore unveils another promising feature of using field-level
inference for high-precision cosmology.

rapidly evolving galaxies with characteristic delayed-$\tau$ SFH time-scales of
$<0.5$ Gyr reach the red sequence at these redshifts, after a period of
accelerated colour evolution across the green valley. These results indicate
that the stellar mass build-up of these galaxies stays minimal after leaving
the blue cloud and entering the green valley (i.e., it may represent $\lesssim
5\%$ of the galaxies' final, quiescent masses). Visual inspection of
age-sensitive features in the stacked spectra also supports the view that these
galaxies follow a quenching sequence along the blue-cloud $\rightarrow$
green-valley $\rightarrow$ red-sequence track. For this rapidly evolving
population, we measure a green-valley crossing time-scale of
$0.99^{+0.42}_{-0.25}$ Gyr and a crossing rate at the bottom of the green

estimate that the number density of massive ($M_\star>10^{10} M_\odot$)
red-sequence galaxies doubles every Gyr at these redshifts, in remarkable
agreement with the evolution of the quiescent galaxy stellar mass function.
These results offer a new approach to measuring galaxy quenching over time and

these stars and other disk objects, suggesting that star-star mergers result in
rapid mass loss from the remnant to restore an equilibrium mass, while
star-compact object mergers may result in exotic outcomes and even host binary

rapidly lose mass and form a population of stellar mass black holes around

relative local lens properties between the multiple image positions, we cannot
distinguish common scalings and distortions caused by lensing from intrinsic
source characteristics. The consequences of this degeneracy for lens modelling
and our approach and ways to break it are detailed here. We also set up
quantitative measures around the critical curve to find clear limits on the
validity of the approximation that source properties are negligible to infer

custom model of a rotating exponential disk with uniform dispersion, whose
light is projected through a slit and corrected for beam smearing. We then
apply an asymmetric drift correction based on assumptions common in the
literature to the fitted kinematic components to obtain the circular velocity,
assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. Within the half-light radius,
$\mathrm{M_{dyn,eml}}$ is on average lower than $\mathrm{M_{dyn,*}}$, with a
mean offset of $-0.15\pm0.016$ dex and galaxy-to-galaxy scatter of $0.19$ dex,
reflecting the combined random uncertainty. While data of higher spatial
resolution are needed to understand this small offset, it supports the
assumption that the galaxy-wide ionized gas kinematics do not predominantly
originate from disruptive events such as star formation driven outflows.
However, a similar agreement can be obtained without modeling from the
integrated emission line dispersions for axis ratios $q<0.8$. This suggests
that our current understanding of gas kinematics is not sufficient to
efficiently apply asymmetric drift corrections to improve dynamical mass

models. However, below 0.1 mJy, they are lower by 0.4 dex compared to two deep
ALMA studies but consistent with ASPECS-LP to 1sigma. Importantly, the
flattening found for our cumulative counts extends further to 0.01 mJy. Our
results bring further support in line of the flattening of the number counts
reported previously by us and ASPECS-LP, which has been interpreted by a recent
galaxy evolution model as a measurement of the ""knee"" of the infrared
luminosity function at high redshift. Our estimates of the contribution to the

first comprehensive characterization of the QLT in two dimensions (2D) for a

real-space clusters via level-spacing statistics and localization in
configuration space. We argue for the presence of two regimes - one in which
large finite-size clusters effectively behave non-ergodically, a result
naturally accounted for as an interference phenomenon in configuration space
and the other in which all large clusters behave ergodically. As one central
result, in the latter regime we claim that the QLT is equivalent to the

primary driver of quenching in massive galaxies, but the best way to implement
SMBH physics into galaxy formation simulations remains ambiguous. As part of
the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, we explore the effects
of different modeling choices for SMBH accretion and feedback in a suite of
$\sim500$ cosmological zoom-in simulations across a wide range of halo mass
(10^10-10^13 Msun). Within the suite, we vary the numerical schemes for BH
accretion and feedback, the accretion efficiency, and the strength of
mechanical, radiative, and cosmic ray feedback independently. We then compare
the outcomes to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find several models that
satisfy the observational constraints, and for which the energetics in
different feedback channels are physically plausible. Interestingly, cosmic
rays accelerated by SMBHs play an important role in many successful models.
However, it is non-trivial to reproduce scaling relations across halo mass, and
many model variations produce qualitatively incorrect results regardless of
parameter choices. The growth of stellar and BH mass are closely related: for
example, over-massive BHs tend to over-quench galaxies. BH mass is most
strongly affected by the choice of accretion efficiency in high-mass halos, but
by feedback efficiency in low-mass halos. The amount of star formation
suppression by SMBH feedback in low-mass halos is determined primarily by the
time-integrated feedback energy. For massive galaxies, the ""responsiveness"" of
a model (i.e. how quickly and powerfully the BH responds to gas available for
accretion) is an additional important factor for quenching.

matches lexical expectations. To overcome this confound, we probe grammatical

expectations are not sufficient, and word order knowledge is necessary for
correct classification. Such non-prototypical instances are naturally occurring
English sentences with inanimate subjects or animate objects, or sentences
where we systematically swap the arguments to make sentences like ""The onion

lexical, word order is in fact crucial in defining the later-layer
representations of words in semantically non-prototypical positions. Our
experiments isolate the effect of word order on the contextualization process,

each model size from a different random initialization. As an alternative, we
consider a staged training setup that begins with a small model and
incrementally increases the amount of compute used for training by applying a
""growth operator"" to increase the model depth and width. By initializing each
stage with the output of the previous one, the training process effectively
re-uses the compute from prior stages and becomes more efficient. Our growth
operators each take as input the entire training state (including model
parameters, optimizer state, learning rate schedule, etc.) and output a new
training state from which training continues. We identify two important
properties of these growth operators, namely that they preserve both the loss
and the ""training dynamics"" after applying the operator. While the
loss-preserving property has been discussed previously, to the best of our
knowledge this work is the first to identify the importance of preserving the
training dynamics (the rate of decrease of the loss during training). To find
the optimal schedule for stages, we use the scaling laws from (Kaplan et al.,
2020) to find a precise schedule that gives the most compute saving by starting
a new stage when training efficiency starts decreasing. We empirically validate
our growth operators and staged training for autoregressive language models,
showing up to 22% compute savings compared to a strong baseline trained from

flow prediction. TrafPS consists of three layers, from data process to results
computation and visualization. We design three visualization views in TrafPS to
support the prediction analysis process. One demonstration shows that the
TrafPS supports an effective analytical pipeline on interpreting the prediction
flow to users and provides an intuitive visualization for decision making.

collecting sufficient amounts of annotated relations and attributes for

paper, we address this problem by introducing a novel incremental active

While conventional active learning methods ask for labels of specific examples,
we flip this framing to allow agents to ask for examples from specific

asks for examples from the tail of the data distribution and show that it
outperforms classical active learning methods on Visual Genome.

medical practitioners with full information about the region of interest in the

compensation of the adverse impact of losing useful information owing to the
lack of one or more modalities is a well-known challenge in the field of
computer vision, particularly for medical image processing tasks including
tumour segmentation, tissue classification, and image generation. Various
approaches have been developed over time to mitigate this problem's negative
implications and this literature review goes through a significant number of
the networks that seek to do so. The approaches reviewed in this work are
reviewed in detail, including earlier techniques such as synthesis methods as
well as later approaches that deploy deep learning, such as common latent space

generative adversarial networks (GANs). This work discusses the most important
approaches that have been offered at the time of this writing, examining the
novelty, strength, and weakness of each one. Furthermore, the most commonly
used MRI datasets are highlighted and described. The main goal of this research
is to offer a performance evaluation of missing modality compensating networks,

treatment. In this work, we formulate the identification problem as a global
optimization problem, by minimizing the mismatch between the ECG predicted by a
cardiac model, when paced at a given EAS, and the observed ECG during the

constituent cells remains to be elucidated. At the purely mechanical level, the
degree of rigidity of different cellular components, such as the nucleus and
the cytoplasm, modulates the interplay between the cell inner processes and the
external environment, while simultaneously mediating the mechanical
interactions between neighboring cells. Being able to quantify the correlation
between single-cell and tissue properties would improve our mechanobiological
understanding of cell tissues. Here we develop a methodology to quantitatively
extract a set of structural and motility parameters from the analysis of
time-lapse movies of nuclei belonging to jammed and flocking cell monolayers.
We then study in detail the correlation between the dynamical state of the
tissue and the deformation of the nuclei. We observe that the nuclear
deformation rate linearly correlates with the local divergence of the velocity
field, which leads to a non-invasive estimate of the elastic modulus of the
nucleus relative to the one of the cytoplasm. We also find that nuclei
belonging to flocking monolayers, subjected to larger mechanical perturbations,
are about two times stiffer than nuclei belonging to dynamically arrested
monolayers, in agreement with atomic force microscopy results. Our results
demonstrate a non-invasive route to the determination of nuclear relative
stiffness for cells in a monolayer.

concurrent objects, transactional memory, etc.) simplify matters, but still
involve intricate engineering. We argue that some difficulty of multicore
programming can be meliorated through a declarative programming style in which
programmers directly express the independence of fragments of sequential
programs.
  In our proposed paradigm, programmers write programs in a familiar,
sequential manner, with the added ability to explicitly express the conditions
under which code fragments sequentially commute. Putting such commutativity
conditions into source code offers a new entry point for a compiler to exploit
the known connection between commutativity and parallelism. We give a semantics
for the programmer's sequential perspective and, under a correctness condition,
find that a compiler-transformed parallel execution is equivalent to the
sequential semantics. Serializability/linearizability are not the right fit for
this condition, so we introduce scoped serializability and show how it can be
enforced with lock synthesis techniques.
  We next describe a technique for automatically verifying and synthesizing
commute conditions via a new reduction from our commute blocks to logical
specifications, upon which symbolic commutativity reasoning can be performed.

concerning the relationship between orbits of interior points and orbits of
boundary points under iterates of holomorphic self-maps of the unit disc. Here
we address such questions in the much more general setting of sequences $(F_n)$
of holomorphic maps between simply connected domains. We show that, while some
classical results can be generalised, with an interesting dependence on the
geometry of the domains, a much richer variety of behaviours is possible. Some
of our results are new even in the classical setting.
  Our methods apply in particular to non-autonomous dynamical systems, when
$(F_n)$ are forward compositions of holomorphic maps, and to the study of
wandering domains in holomorphic dynamics.
  We construct examples to illustrate the possible behaviours that can occur.
Our proofs use techniques from geometric function theory, measure theory and
ergodic theory, and the examples involve a `weak independence' version of the
second Borel--Cantelli lemma and the concept from ergodic theory of `shrinking

tight lower bounds on the entanglement cost needed to win the clock game, with

low-temperature NbTi superconductor cables. Recent tests of the HTS-based 0.5 m
long two-bore superconducting accelerator magnet have shown record high dB/dt

No temperature rise in 6 K cooling He was observed within the 0.003 K error

coil to be less than 0.2 W/m. Based on this result we outline a possible
upgrade of this test magnet design to 2 T B-field in the 10 mm beam gap with
the dB/dt ramping rates up to 1000 T/s. The power test results of this short
sample magnet will be used to project both cryogenic and electrical power
losses as a function of the magnet B-field and the dB/dt ramping rates. Then
these projections will be scaled to the range of expected accelerator magnet
beam gaps and B-fields for the proton and muon RCS accelerators. We invite

understanding and quantifying the association between the longitudinal markers

longitudinal markers. A joint model involves multiple submodels (one for each
longitudinal/survival outcome) usually linked together through correlated or
shared random effects. Their estimation is computationally expensive
(particularly due to a multidimensional integration of the likelihood over the
random effects distribution) so that inference methods become rapidly
intractable, and restricts applications of joint models to a small number of
longitudinal markers and/or random effects. We introduce a Bayesian
approximation based on the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation algorithm
implemented in the R package R-INLA to alleviate the computational burden and
allow the estimation of multivariate joint models with less restrictions. Our
simulation studies show that R-INLA substantially reduces the computation time
and the variability of the parameter estimates compared to alternative

variable inputs. Then on new trajectories we backpropagate prediction errors to
the system parameter inputs giving us a gradient. We then use gradient descent
to infer the correct system parameter. We demonstrate the efficacy of our

interference, LA is performed by computing the post-equalization
signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver. The same technique

systems that imparts a complicated mathematical and physical nature to Ohm's
law. The numerical codes that solve the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations
have to be able to deal with the singularities that are naturally created in
the system by the ambipolar diffusion term. The global aim is to calculate a
set of theoretical self-similar solutions to the nonlinear diffusion equation
with cylindrical symmetry that can be used as tests for MHD codes which include
the ambipolar diffusion term. First, following the general methods developed in
the applied mathematics literature, we obtained the theoretical solutions as
eigenfunctions of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Phase-plane
techniques were used to integrate through the singularities at the locations of
the nulls, which correspond to infinitely sharp current sheets. In the second
half of the paper, we consider the use of these solutions as tests for MHD
codes. To that end, we used the Bifrost code, thereby testing the capabilities
of these solutions as tests as well as (inversely) the accuracy of Bifrost's
recently developed ambipolar diffusion module. The obtained solutions are shown
to constitute a demanding, but nonetheless viable, test for MHD codes that
incorporate ambipolar diffusion. The Bifrost code is able to reproduce the
theoretical solutions with sufficient accuracy up to very advanced diffusive
times. Using the code, we also explored the asymptotic properties of our
theoretical solutions in time when initially perturbed with either small or
finite perturbations. The functions obtained in this paper are relevant as
physical solutions and also as tests for general MHD codes. They provide a more
stringent and general test than the simple
Zeldovich-Kompaneets-Barenblatt-Pattle solution.

  Conference (ECC) Napoli, Italy, June 25-28, 2019",,"10.23919/ECC.2019.8796165",,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper we consider the localization problem for a visual sensor
network. Inspired by the alternate attitude and position distributed
optimization framework discussed in [1], we propose an estimation scheme that
exploits the unit dual quaternion algebra to describe the sensors pose. This
representation is beneficial in the formulation of the optimization scheme
allowing to solve the localization problem without designing two interlaced
position and orientation estimators, thus improving the estimation error
distribution over the two pose components and the overall localization
performance. Furthermore, the numerical experimentation asserts the robustness
of the proposed algorithm w.r.t. the initial conditions.

practice in synthetic control studies. The proposed principles follow from
formal properties of synthetic control estimators, and pertain to the nature,
implications, and prevention of over-fitting biases within a synthetic control
framework, to the interpretability of the results, and to the availability of
validation exercises. We discuss and visually demonstrate the relevance of the
proposed principles under a variety of data configurations.

generation of entangled photons. The realization of a radiative cascade with
impurity atoms in semiconductors, a leading platform for the generation of
quantum light, would therefore provide a new avenue for the development of
entangled photon pair sources. Here we demonstrate a radiative cascade from the
decay of a biexciton at an impurity-atom complex in a ZnSe quantum well. The
emitted photons show clear temporal correlations revealing the time--ordering
of the cascade. Our result establishes impurity atoms in ZnSe as a potential
platform for photonic quantum technologies using radiative cascades.

vortex tube is developed for sub-grid modeling to be coupled with the resolved
flow for turbulent combustion. The model has critical new features compared to
existing models. (i) Non-premixed flames, premixed flames, or multi-branched
flame structures are determined rather than prescribed. (ii) The effects of
vorticity and the related centifugal acceleration are determined. (iii) The
strain rates and vorticity applied at the sub-grid level can be directly
determined from the resolved-scale strain rates and vorticity without a
contrived progress variable. (iv) The flamelet model is three-dimensional. (v)
The effect of variable density is addressed. (vi) The inward swirl is created
by vorticity combined with two compressive normal strain components; this
feature distinguishes the model from counterflow flamelet models. Solutions to
the multicomponent Navier-Stokes equations governing the flamelet model are
obtained. By coordinate transformation, a similar solution is found for the
model, through a system of ordinary differential equations. Vorticity creates a
centrifugal force on the sub-grid counterflow that modifies the molecular
transport rates, burning rates, and flammability limits. Sample computations of
the inward swirling rotational flamelet model without coupling to the resolved
flow are presented to demonstrate the importance of the new features. Premixed,
nonpremixed, and multi-branched flame structures are examined. Parameter
surveys are made with rate of normal strain, vorticity, Damk\""{o}hler number,

combined with the variable-density field. Flow direction can reverse; burning
rates can be modified; flammability limits can be extended.

extreme ultraviolet images of the solar active regions, which we refer to as
active region moving campfires (ARMCs), are related to local plasma temperature

in the entire coronal plasma. Our previous study of ARMCs indicates that they
have characteristic velocities at around the background sound speed. The main
goal of our work is to carry out a simultaneous analysis of EUV images from two
observational missions, SDO/AIA and Hi-C 2.1. The aims of the performed
cross-validating analysis of both SDO/AIA and Hi-C 2.1 data were to reveal how
the observed moving features are distributed over the studied active region,
AR12712, test the existence of different groups of ARMCs with distinct physical
characteristics. We use the statistical model of intensity centroid convergence
and tracking that was developed in our previous paper. Furthermore, a Gaussian
mixture model fit of the observed complex of moving ARMCs is elaborated to
reveal the existence of distinct ARMC groups and to study the physical
characteristics of these different groups. In data from the 171\AA, 193\AA\ and
211\AA\ channels of SDO/AIA, we identified several groups of ARMCs with respect
to both blob intensity and velocity profiles. The existence of such groups is
confirmed by the cross-validation of the 172\AA\ data sets from Hi-C 2.1. The
ARMCs studied in this paper have characteristic velocities in the range of the
typical sound speeds in coronal loops. Hence, these moving objects differ from
the well-known rapid Alfv\'enic velocity jets from magnetic reconnection sites.
This is also proven by the fact that ARMCs propagate along the active region
magnetic structure (strands). The nature of the discovered statistical grouping
of the ARMC events is not known.

available. Yet with vendor-specific frameworks, code portability seems at risk,
especially in a field where hardware and software libraries have not yet
reached a consolidated state, and even foundational aspects of the technologies
are still in flux. Accordingly, the development of vendor-independent quantum
programming languages and frameworks is often suggested. This follows the
established architectural pattern of introducing additional levels of
abstraction into software stacks, thereby piling on layers of abstraction. Yet
software architecture also provides seemingly less abstract alternatives,
namely to focus on hardware-specific formulations of problems that peel off
unnecessary layers. In this article, we quantitatively and experimentally
explore these strategic alternatives, and compare popular quantum frameworks
from the software implementation perspective. We find that for several
specific, yet generalisable problems, the mathematical formulation of the
problem to be solved is not just sufficiently abstract and serves as precise
description, but is likewise concrete enough to allow for deriving
framework-specific implementations with little effort. Additionally, we argue,
based on analysing dozens of existing quantum codes, that porting between
frameworks is actually low-effort, since the quantum- and framework-specific
portions are very manageable in terms of size, commonly in the order of mere
hundreds of lines of code. Given the current state-of-the-art in quantum
programming practice, this leads us to argue in favour of peeling off

relevant information about the atmospheric chemistry. The method allows us to
extract, without any prior assumptions or additional information, the relative

  suspensions of rough particles",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a method to parameterize a coarse grained model for the
hydrodynamic friction between nearly touching rough spheres in suspension
flows. The frictional resistance due to surface roughness primarily alters the
sliding and rolling modes of motion of rough particles. Stokesian dynamics
simulations incorporating a near-field pairwise resistance model accounting for
these enhanced frictional modes were employed to compute particle trajectories
in shear flow. In this model, the resistance to sliding and rolling modes of
motion are augmented from a weakly diverging log$(1/h)$ form for smooth spheres
to a strongly diverging $1/h$ form for rough spheres to account for the
additional resistance due to squeezing flows between surface asperities, where
$h$ is the mean surface separation between particles. We determine new bounds
on the relative magnitude of the augmentations to the resistance to different
modes of motion using inequality constraints reflecting the positive
definiteness of the Stokes resistance tensor for a pair of rough particles.
Using the simulations of a particle pair in a shear flow, a simple model for
angular rotation rate of the pair centerline is computed as a function of its
orientation in the shear flow and the free parameters of the hydrodynamic
resistance model: the friction coupling strength, $\alpha$, and friction
coupling range, $h_0$. Values of $\alpha$ and $h_0$ for real-world rough
particles can then be inferred by matching the pair rotation rate in the model
to experimental observations when a dilute rough particle suspension is
subjected to a linear shear flow. The same model is used to calculate the
hydrodynamic contribution to the high frequency viscosity of rough particle
suspensions. For different $\alpha$ and $h_0$, we observe that the viscosity
diverges differently depending on $h_0$.

loss rates. First, we locate the transition from stellar X-ray and UV-driven
escape to rapid Roche lobe overflow, which occurs once the 10-100 nbar pressure
level in the atmosphere reaches the Roche lobe. Planets enter this regime when
the ratio of the substellar radius to the polar radius along the visible
surface pressure level, that aligns with a surface of constant Roche potential,
is X/Z~$\gtrsim$~1.2 for Jovian planets (Mp~$\gtrsim$~100 M$_{\Earth}$) and
X/Z~$\gtrsim$~1.02 for sub-Jovian planets ($M_p \approx$~10--100 M$_{\Earth}$).
Around a sun-like star, this regime applies to orbital periods of less than two
days for planets with radii of about 3--14 R$_{\Earth}$. Our results agree with
the properties of known transiting planets and can explain parts of the
sub-Jovian desert in the population of known exoplanets. Second, we present
detailed numerical simulations of atmospheric escape from a planet like Uranus
or Neptune orbiting close to a sun-like star that support the results above and
point to interesting qualitative differences between hot Jupiters and
sub-Jovian planets. We find that hot Neptunes with solar metallicity hydrogen
and helium envelopes have relatively more extended upper atmospheres than
typical hot Jupiters, with a lower ionization fraction and higher abundances of
escaping molecules. This is consistent with existing ultraviolet transit
observations of warm Neptunes and it might provide a way to use future
observations and models to distinguish solar metallicity atmospheres from
higher metallicity atmospheres.

the periodic activity of fast radio burst (FRB) sources, by including the
effects of gravitational wave (GW) radiation. In this model, the WD fills its
Roche lobe at the periastron and mass transfer occurs from the WD to the NS.
The accreted materials can be fragmented and arrive at the NS episodically,
resulting in multiple bursts through curvature radiation. Consequently, the WD
may be kicked away owing to the conservation of angular momentum. To initiate
the next mass transfer, the WD has to refill its Roche lobe through GW
radiation. In this scenario, whether the periodic activity can show up relies
on three timescales, i.e., the orbital period $P_{\rm orb}$, the timescale
$T_{\rm GW}$ for the Roche lobe to be refilled, and the time span $T_{\rm
frag}$ for all the episodic events corresponding to each mass transfer process.
Only when the two conditions $T_{\rm GW} \gtrsim P_{\rm orb}$ and $T_{\rm frag}
< P_{\rm orb}$ are both satisfied, the periodic activity will manifest itself
and the period should be equal to $P_{\rm orb}$. In this spirit, the periodic
activity is more likely to show up for relatively long periods ($P_{\rm orb}
\gtrsim$ several days). Thus, it is reasonable that FRBs 180916 and 121102, the
only two sources having been claimed to manifest periodic activity, both
correspond to relatively long periods.

methods are far from real-world applications due to the low generalization
across different scenes. As a result, the generated images usually contain
artifacts or the filled pixels differ greatly from the ground truth.
Image-level predictive filtering is a widely used image restoration technique,
predicting suitable kernels adaptively according to different input scenes.
Inspired by this inherent advantage, we explore the possibility of addressing
image inpainting as a filtering task. To this end, we first study the
advantages and challenges of image-level predictive filtering for image
inpainting: the method can preserve local structures and avoid artifacts but
fails to fill large missing areas. Then, we propose semantic filtering by
conducting filtering on the deep feature level, which fills the missing
semantic information but fails to recover the details. To address the issues
while adopting the respective advantages, we propose a novel filtering
technique, i.e., Multilevel Interactive Siamese Filtering (MISF), which
contains two branches: kernel prediction branch (KPB) and semantic & image
filtering branch (SIFB). These two branches are interactively linked: SIFB
provides multi-level features for KPB while KPB predicts dynamic kernels for
SIFB. As a result, the final method takes the advantage of effective semantic &
image-level filling for high-fidelity inpainting. We validate our method on
three challenging datasets, i.e., Dunhuang, Places2, and CelebA. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four metrics, i.e., L1, PSNR, SSIM,

Although embedding-based entity alignment has recently achieved remarkable

Conventional semi-supervised methods also suffer from the incorrect entity

an iterative cycle-teaching framework for semi-supervised entity alignment. The
key idea is to train multiple entity alignment models (called aligners)
simultaneously and let each aligner iteratively teach its successor the
proposed new entity alignment. We propose a diversity-aware alignment selection
method to choose reliable entity alignment for each aligner. We also design a
conflict resolution mechanism to resolve the alignment conflict when combining
the new alignment of an aligner and that from its teacher. Besides, considering
the influence of cycle-teaching order, we elaborately design a strategy to
arrange the optimal order that can maximize the overall performance of multiple
aligners. The cycle-teaching process can break the limitations of each model's
learning capability and reduce the noise in new training data, leading to
improved performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed cycle-teaching framework, which significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art models when the training data is insufficient

$\partial I$ is inside and near horizon. When cutoff surface is set to be near

which is regarded as the significant key to unlocking the bottleneck of
contemporary transportation systems from the perspectives of safety, mobility,
and sustainability. Most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection
methods from point clouds are developed based on a single onboard LiDAR, whose
performance will be inevitably limited by the range and occlusion, especially
in dense traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose \textit{PillarGrid}, a
novel cooperative perception method fusing information from multiple 3D LiDARs
(both on-board and roadside), to enhance the situation awareness for connected
and automated vehicles (CAVs). PillarGrid consists of four main phases: 1)
cooperative preprocessing of point clouds, 2) pillar-wise voxelization and
feature extraction, 3) grid-wise deep fusion of features from multiple sensors,
and 4) convolutional neural network (CNN)-based augmented 3D object detection.
A novel cooperative perception platform is developed for model training and
testing. Extensive experimentation shows that PillarGrid outperforms the SOTA
single-LiDAR-based 3D object detection methods with respect to both accuracy
and range by a large margin.

magnitude of 2.0. Using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public database, I
found that this nova is currently a dwarf nova with a cycle length of ~24 d.
Compared to other classical novae currently in dwarf nova-type states,
outbursts of V476 Cyg are rapidly rising and short with durations of a few
days. Based on the AAVSO observations, this nova was probably already in the
dwarf nova-type phase in 2016, 96 years after the nova eruption. I found a
possible orbital period of 0.1018002(6) d using the ZTF data, which would place
the object in the period gap. This supposed short orbital period appears to
explain the features and faint absolute magnitudes of the observed dwarf nova
outbursts. If this period is confirmed, V476 Cyg is a classical nova with the
shortest orbital period with distinct dwarf nova outbursts and in which a nova
eruption was recorded in the modern era. I also compared with the outburst
properties with V446 Her (Nova Her 1960), which currently shows SS Cyg-type
outbursts. The transition to the dwarf nova-phase in V476 Cyg occurred much
earlier (~100 yr) than what has been supposed (~1000 yr) for classical novae
below the period gap. V476 Cyg would not only provide an ideal laboratory of
the behavior of an irradiated accretion disk in which tidal instability is
expected to work, but also an ideal laboratory of the effect of a massive white
dwarf on dwarf nova outbursts.

  Translation","Accepted by CVPR2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Remarkable achievements have been attained with Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) in image-to-image translation. However, due to a tremendous
amount of parameters, state-of-the-art GANs usually suffer from low efficiency
and bulky memory usage. To tackle this challenge, firstly, this paper
investigates GANs performance from a frequency perspective. The results show
that GANs, especially small GANs lack the ability to generate high-quality high
frequency information. To address this problem, we propose a novel knowledge
distillation method referred to as wavelet knowledge distillation. Instead of
directly distilling the generated images of teachers, wavelet knowledge
distillation first decomposes the images into different frequency bands with
discrete wavelet transformation and then only distills the high frequency
bands. As a result, the student GAN can pay more attention to its learning on
high frequency bands. Experiments demonstrate that our method leads to 7.08
times compression and 6.80 times acceleration on CycleGAN with almost no
performance drop. Additionally, we have studied the relation between
discriminators and generators which shows that the compression of
discriminators can promote the performance of compressed generators.

limitations of current astronomical facilities, the fine shock structure and
the detailed interaction process still remain unclear. Here we investigate the
plasma dynamics under different collision states through laser-driven
experiments. A double-shock structure is shown in the optical diagnosis for
collision case, but the integrated self-emitting X-ray characteristic is
different. For solid plastic hemisphere obstacle, two-layer shock emission is
observed, and for the relatively low-density laser-driven plasma core, only one
shock emission is shown. And the plasma jets are deflected by $50 ^{\circ}$
through the interaction with the high-density background in both cases. For
collisionless cases, filament structures are observed, and the mean width of
filaments is roughly the same as the ion skin depth. High-energy electrons are
observed in all interaction cases. We present the detailed process of the shock

from finite element approximations of $2m$th ($m = 1, 2$) order symmetric
elliptic eigenvalue problems. Our method works effectively to compute the first
several eigenpairs, including both multiple and clustered eigenvalues with
corresponding eigenfunctions, particularly. The method is highly parallelizable
by constructing a new and efficient preconditioner using an overlapping domain
decomposition (DD). It only requires computing a couple of small scale parallel
subproblems and a quite small scale eigenvalue problem per iteration. Our
theoretical analysis reveals that the convergence rate of the method is bounded
by $c(H)(1-C\frac{\delta^{2m-1}}{H^{2m-1}})^{2}$, where $H$ is the diameter of
subdomains and $\delta$ is the overlapping size among subdomains. The constant
$C$ is independent of the mesh size $h$ and the internal gaps among the target
eigenvalues, demonstrating that our method is optimal and cluster robust.
Meanwhile, the $H$-dependent constant $c(H)$ decreases monotonically to $1$, as
$H \to 0$, which means that more subdomains lead to the better convergence
rate. Numerical results supporting our theory are given.

first detailed computational investigation of the bow shock of Zeta Ophiuchi,
to test whether a simple model of the bow shock can explain the observed
nebula, and to compare the detected X-ray emission with simulated emission
maps. We re-analysed archival {\it Chandra} observations of the thermal diffuse
X-ray emission from the shocked wind region of the bow shock, finding total
unabsorbed X-ray flux (0.3-2 keV band) corresponding to a diffuse luminosity of
$L_\mathrm{X}=2.33~(0.79-3.45)\times10^{29}$ergs$^{-1}$. 3D MHD simulations
were used to model the interaction of the star's wind with a uniform ISM using
a range of stellar and ISM parameters motivated by observational constraints.

maps were generated from three simulations, for comparison with relevant

significant radial velocity produce infrared emission maps with opening angle

of multipartite entanglement, and magnetic Van Hove correlations $G(r,t)$, a

extracted from inelastic neutron scattering on spin systems through accurate
measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor $S(k,\omega)$. Here we
apply theoretically these ideas to the half-filled Hubbard chain with
nearest-neighbor hopping, away from the strong-coupling limit. This model has
nontrivial redistribution of spectral weight in $S(k,\omega)$ going from the
non-interacting limit ($U=0$) to strong coupling ($U\rightarrow \infty$), where
it reduces to the Heisenberg quantum spin chain. We use the density matrix
renormalization group (DMRG) to find $S(k,\omega)$, from which QFI is then
calculated. We find that QFI grows with $U$. With realistic energy resolution
it becomes capable of witnessing bipartite entanglement above $U=2.5$ (in units
of the hopping), where it also changes slope. This point is also proximate to
slope changes of the bandwidth $W(U)$ and the half-chain von Neumann
entanglement entropy. We compute $G(r,t)$ by Fourier-transforming
$S(k,\omega)$. The results indicate a crossover in the short-time
short-distance dynamics at low $U$ characterized by ferromagnetic lightcone
wavefronts, to a Heisenberg-like behavior at large $U$ featuring
antiferromagnetic lightcones and spatially period-doubled antiferromagnetism.
We find this crossover has largely been completed by $U=3$. Our results thus
provide evidence that, in several aspects, the strong-coupling limit of the
Hubbard chain is reached qualitatively already at a relatively modest
interaction strength. We discuss experimental candidates for observing the
$G(r,t)$ dynamics found at low $U$.

cyber-physical systems (CPSs), multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based
methodologies are integrated into the control process of physical systems and
demonstrate prominent performance in a wide array of CPS domains, such as
connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). However, it remains challenging to
mathematically characterize the improvement of the performance of CAVs with
communication and cooperation capability. When each individual autonomous
vehicle is originally self-interest, we can not assume that all agents would
cooperate naturally during the training process. In this work, we propose to
reallocate the system's total reward efficiently to motivate stable cooperation
among autonomous vehicles. We formally define and quantify how to reallocate
the system's total reward to each agent under the proposed transferable utility
game, such that communication-based cooperation among multi-agents increases
the system's total reward. We prove that Shapley value-based reward
reallocation of MARL locates in the core if the transferable utility game is a
convex game. Hence, the cooperation is stable and efficient and the agents
should stay in the coalition or the cooperating group. We then propose a
cooperative policy learning algorithm with Shapley value reward reallocation.
In experiments, compared with several literature algorithms, we show the
improvement of the mean episode system reward of CAV systems using our proposed
algorithm.

Latin hypercube designs are the first systematic approach to address this
issue. However, it comes with the increasing cost associated with an increasing
large number of level combinations of the qualitative factors. For the reason
of run size economy, marginally coupled designs were proposed in which the
design for the quantitative factors is a sliced Latin hypercube design with
respect to each qualitative factor. The drawback of such designs is that the
corresponding data may not be able to capture the effects between any two (and
more) qualitative factors and quantitative factors. To balance the run size and
design efficiency, we propose a new type of designs, doubly coupled designs,
where the design points for the quantitative factors form a sliced Latin
hypercube design with respect to the levels of any qualitative factor and with
respect to the level combinations of any two qualitative factors, respectively.
The proposed designs have the better stratification property between the
qualitative and quantitative factors compared with marginally coupled designs.
The existence of the proposed designs is established. Several construction
methods are introduced, and the properties of the resulting designs are also
studied.

enables collaborative model training while avoiding explicit data sharing. The
inherent privacy-preserving property of FL algorithms makes them especially
attractive to the medical field. However, in case of heterogeneous client data
distributions, standard FL methods are unstable and require intensive
hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. Conventional
hyperparameter optimization algorithms are impractical in real-world FL
applications as they involve numerous training trials, which are often not
affordable with limited compute budgets. In this work, we propose an efficient
reinforcement learning (RL)-based federated hyperparameter optimization
algorithm, termed Auto-FedRL, in which an online RL agent can dynamically
adjust hyperparameters of each client based on the current training progress.
Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate different search strategies
and RL agents. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on a
heterogeneous data split of the CIFAR-10 dataset as well as two real-world
medical image segmentation datasets for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in chest
CT and pancreas segmentation in abdominal CT.

commonly believed to own higher modeling capacity and representation
flexibility, than traditional convolutional networks. However, it is
questionable whether such potential has been fully unleashed in practice, as
the learned ViTs often suffer from over-smoothening, yielding likely redundant
models. Recent works made preliminary attempts to identify and alleviate such
redundancy, e.g., via regularizing embedding similarity or re-injecting
convolution-like structures. However, a ""head-to-toe assessment"" regarding the
extent of redundancy in ViTs, and how much we could gain by thoroughly
mitigating such, has been absent for this field. This paper, for the first
time, systematically studies the ubiquitous existence of redundancy at all
three levels: patch embedding, attention map, and weight space. In view of
them, we advocate a principle of diversity for training ViTs, by presenting
corresponding regularizers that encourage the representation diversity and
coverage at each of those levels, that enabling capturing more discriminative
information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet with a number of ViT backbones
validate the effectiveness of our proposals, largely eliminating the observed
ViT redundancy and significantly boosting the model generalization. For
example, our diversified DeiT obtains 0.70%~1.76% accuracy boosts on ImageNet
with highly reduced similarity. Our codes are fully available in

massive but less luminous companions, previously proposed to be mass-gap black
holes. Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like
spectra in both systems. Joint modeling of the spectra, light curves, and
spectral energy distributions robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and
radii of both components: the primaries are luminous, cool giants ($T_{\rm

22.5\,R_{\odot}$ and $25\,R_{\odot}$) with exceptionally low masses ($M_{\rm
giant} \approx 0.4\,M_{\odot}$) that likely fill their Roche lobes. The
secondaries are only slightly warmer subgiants ($T_{\rm eff,\,2} = 5,800\,\rm
K$ and $5,150\,\rm K$, $R_2= 8.3\,R_{\odot}$ and $9\,R_{\odot}$) and thus are
consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars with
similar masses ($M_2 \approx 2.8\,M_{\odot}$ and $\approx 1.8\,M_{\odot}$). In
the Unicorn, rapid rotation blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making it
challenging to detect even at wavelengths where it dominates the total light.
Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing and subsequent
envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary
evolution models in which a $1-2\,M_{\odot}$ primary is stripped by a companion
as it ascends the giant branch. The fact that the companions are also evolved
implies either that the initial mass ratio was very near unity, or that the
companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn and
Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely-observed phase of binary evolution
preceding the formation of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually,
compact binaries containing two helium white dwarfs.

detrimental phenomena of thermoacoustic instability. Recent investigations in
such Rijke tubes have utilized various methodologies from dynamical systems

integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and promise a more flexible
joint design. Nevertheless, the existing works on ISAC mainly focus on
exploring the performance of both functionalities simultaneously during the
entire considered period, which may ignore the practical asymmetric sensing and
communication requirements. In particular, always forcing sensing along with
communication may make it is harder to balance between these two
functionalities due to shared spectrum resources and limited transmit power. To
address this issue, we propose a new integrated periodic sensing and
communication mechanism for the UAV-enabled ISAC system to provide a more
flexible trade-off between two integrated functionalities. Specifically, the
system achievable rate is maximized via jointly optimizing UAV trajectory, user
association, target sensing selection, and transmit beamforming, while meeting
the sensing frequency and beam pattern gain requirement for the given targets.
Despite that this problem is highly non-convex and involves closely coupled
integer variables, we derive the closed-form optimal beamforming vector to
dramatically reduce the complexity of beamforming design, and present a tight
lower bound of the achievable rate to facilitate UAV trajectory design. Based
on the above results, we propose a penalty-based algorithm to efficiently solve
the considered problem. The optimal achievable rate and the optimal UAV
location are analyzed under a special case of infinity number of antennas.
Furthermore, we prove the structural symmetry between the optimal solutions in
different ISAC frames without location constraints and propose an efficient
algorithm for solving the problem with location constraints.

reduced-order models (ROMs) of Lagrangian systems, which includes nonlinear
wave equations. Existing intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches
construct structure-preserving Lagrangian ROMs by projecting the Euler-Lagrange
equations of the full-order model (FOM) onto a linear subspace. This Galerkin
projection step requires complete knowledge about the Lagrangian operators in
the FOM and full access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the
proposed Lagrangian operator inference approach embeds the mechanics into the
operator inference framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method
that preserves the underlying Lagrangian structure. The proposed approach
exploits knowledge of the governing equations (but not their discretization) to
define the form and parametrization of a Lagrangian ROM which can then be
learned from projected snapshot data. The method does not require access to FOM
operators or computer code. The numerical results demonstrate Lagrangian
operator inference on an Euler-Bernoulli beam model, the sine-Gordon

fishtail with 779,232 degrees of freedom. Accurate long-time predictions of the

Domain transfer has recently emerged as a promising approach wherein images
exhibiting a domain shift are transformed into other domains for augmentation
or adaptation. However, with the absence of paired and annotated images, models
merely learned by adversarial loss and cycle consistency loss could result in
poor consistency of anatomy structures during the translation. Additionally,
the complexity of learning multi-domain transfer could significantly increase
with the number of target domains and source images. In this paper, we propose
a multi-domain transfer network, named MDT-Net, to address the limitations
above through perceptual supervision. Specifically, our model consists of a
single encoder-decoder network and multiple domain-specific transfer modules to
disentangle feature representations of the anatomy content and domain variance.
Owing to this architecture, the model could significantly reduce the complexity
when the translation is conducted among multiple domains. To demonstrate the
performance of our method, we evaluate our model qualitatively and
quantitatively on RETOUCH, an OCT dataset comprising scans from three different
scanner devices (domains). Furthermore, we take the transfer results as
additional training data for fluid segmentation to prove the advantage of our
model indirectly, i.e., in the task of data adaptation and augmentation.
Experimental results show that our method could bring universal improvement in
these segmentation tasks, which demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of MDT-Net in multi-domain transfer.

processing and interpretation. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches
have shown great promise in hyperspectral unmixing, in particular, unsupervised
unmixing methods based on autoencoder networks are a recent trend. The
autoencoder model, which automatically learns low-dimensional representations
(abundances) and reconstructs data with their corresponding bases (endmembers),
has achieved superior performance in hyperspectral unmixing. In this article,
we explore the effective utilization of spatial and spectral information in
autoencoder-based unmixing networks. Important findings on the use of spatial
and spectral information in the autoencoder framework are discussed. Inspired
by these findings, we propose a spatial-spectral collaborative unmixing

visiting through anonymous networks channels (e.g., Tor). Despite of remarkable
progress in the past years, most existing methods make implicitly a couple of
artificial assumptions that (1) only a single website (i.e., single-tab) is
visited each time, and (2) website fingerprinting data are pre-trimmed into a
single trace per website manually. In reality, a user often open multiple tabs
for multiple websites spontaneously. Indeed, this multi-tab WFA (MT-WFA)
setting has been studied in a few recent works, but all of them still fail to
fully respect the real-world situations. In particular, the overlapping
challenge between website fingerprinting has never been investigated in depth.
In this work, we redefine the problem of MT-WFA as detecting multiple monitored
traces, given a natural untrimmed traffic data including monitored traces,
unmonitored traces, and potentially unconstrained overlapping between them.
This eliminates the above assumptions, going beyond the conventional single
website fingerprint classification perspective taken by all previous WFA
methods. To tackle this realistic MT-WFA problem, we formulate a novel Website
Fingerprint Detection (WFD) model capable of detecting accurately the start and
end points of all the monitored traces and classifying them jointly, given
long, untrimmed raw traffic data. WFD is end-to-end, with the trace
localization and website classification integrated in a single unified
pipeline. To enable quantitative evaluation in our MT-WFA setting, we introduce
new performance metrics. Extensive experiments on several newly constructed
benchmarks show that our WFD outperforms the state-of-the-art alternative
methods in both accuracy and efficiency by a large margin, even with a very
small training set. Code is available at

this work. Existing word-based BERT models regard words as basic units,
however, due to the vocabulary limit of BERT, they only cover high-frequency
words and fall back to character level when encountering out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) words. Different from existing works, MarkBERT keeps the vocabulary being
Chinese characters and inserts boundary markers between contiguous words. Such
design enables the model to handle any words in the same way, no matter they
are OOV words or not. Besides, our model has two additional benefits: first, it
is convenient to add word-level learning objectives over markers, which is
complementary to traditional character and sentence-level pretraining tasks;
second, it can easily incorporate richer semantics such as POS tags of words by
replacing generic markers with POS tag-specific markers. With the simple
markers insertion, MarkBERT can improve the performances of various downstream
tasks including language understanding and sequence labeling. \footnote{All the

cross-modal visual-linguistic relevance. Existing works typically model the
cross-modal relevance in each image, where the anchor object/expression and
their positive expression/object have the same attribute as the negative

objects/expressions are exclusively utilized to learn the implicit
representation of the attribute by a pair of different values, which however
impedes the accuracies of the attribute representations, expression/object

has multiple potential values. To this end, we investigate a novel REC problem
named Group-based REC, where each object/expression is simultaneously employed
to construct the multiple triplets among the semantically similar images. To
tackle the explosion of the negatives and the differentiation of the

the average cross-modal relevance varies a lot across different groups, we
further design an across-group relevance constraint to balance the bias of the
group priority. Experiments on three standard REC benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method.

estimation are the mainstream research directions. However, such methods need
location-level annotation of persons in an image, which is time-consuming and
laborious. Therefore, the weakly supervised method just relying upon the
count-level annotation is urgently needed. Since CNN is not suitable for
modeling the global context and the interactions between image patches, crowd
counting with weakly supervised learning via CNN generally can not show good
performance. The weakly supervised model via Transformer was sequentially
proposed to model the global context and learn contrast features. However, the
transformer directly partitions the crowd images into a series of tokens, which
may not be a good choice due to each pedestrian being an independent
individual, and the parameter number of the network is very large. Hence, we
propose a Joint CNN and Transformer Network (JCTNet) via weakly supervised
learning for crowd counting in this paper. JCTNet consists of three parts: CNN
feature extraction module (CFM), Transformer feature extraction module (TFM),
and counting regression module (CRM). In particular, the CFM extracts crowd
semantic information features, then sends their patch partitions to TRM for
modeling global context, and CRM is used to predict the number of people.
Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that JCTNet can
effectively focus on the crowd regions and obtain superior weakly supervised
counting performance on five mainstream datasets. The number of parameters of
the model can be reduced by about 67%~73% compared with the pure Transformer
works. We also tried to explain the phenomenon that a model constrained only by
count-level annotations can still focus on the crowd regions. We believe our

tasks. They must consume as little energy as possible (be energy-efficient or
economical) but at the same time fulfil their functions (be functionally
effective). Neurons displaying best performance for such multi-task trade-offs
are said to be Pareto optimal. However, it is not understood how ion channel
parameters contribute to the Pareto optimal performance of neurons. Ion channel
degeneracy implies that multiple combinations of ion channel parameters can
lead to functionally similar neuronal behavior. Therefore, to simulate
functional behavior, instead of a single model, neuroscientists often use
populations of valid models with distinct ion conductance configurations. This
approach is called population (also database or ensemble) modeling. It remains
unclear, which ion channel parameters in a vast population of functional models
are more likely to be found in the brain. Here we propose that Pareto
optimality can serve as a guiding principle for addressing this issue. The
Pareto optimum concept can help identify the subpopulations of
conductance-based models with ion channel configurations that perform best for
the trade-off between economy and functional effectiveness. In this way, the
high-dimensional parameter space of neuronal models might be reduced to
geometrically simple low-dimensional manifolds. Therefore, Pareto optimality is
a promising framework for improving population modeling of neurons and their
circuits. We also discuss how Pareto inference might help deduce neuronal
functions from high-dimensional Patch-seq data. Furthermore, we hypothesize
that Pareto optimality might contribute to our understanding of observed ion
channel correlations in neurons.

variations of the chemical composition of the solution by changing their
conformation, with notable examples including polyelectrolytes, proteins and
DNA. The polymer conformation changes can occur in response to changes to the
pH, the ionic strength or to the concentration of a generic solute that
interacts with the polymer. These chemical stimuli can lead to drastic
variations of the polymer flexibility and even trigger a transition from a coil
to a globule polymer conformation. In many situations the spatial distribution
of the chemical stimuli can be highly inhomogeneous, which can lead to large
spatial variations of polymer conformation and of the rheological properties of
the mixture. In this paper, we develop a theory for the flow of a mixture of a
solute and chemically-responsive polymers. The approach is valid for generic
flows and inhomogeneous distributions of polymers and solutes. To model the
polymer conformation changes introduced by the interactions with the solute, we
consider the polymers as linear elastic dumbbells whose spring stiffness
depends on the solute concentration. We use the Onsager's variational formalism
to derive the equations governing the evolution of the variables, which unveils
novel couplings between the distribution of dumbbells and that of the solute.
Finally, we use a linear stability analysis to show that the governing
equations predict an equilibrium phase separation and a distinct shear-induced
phase separation whereby a homogeneous distribution of solute and dumbbells
spontaneously demix. Similar phase transitions have been observed in previous
experiments using stimuli-responsive polymers and may play an important role in
living systems.

strong technological trend nowadays, quite appealing to both private and public

analytics is an extremely powerful methodology for gaining insights from
unstructured data, coming from customer and human agent conversations. In this
work, we describe an experimentation with a speech analytics process for an
Italian contact center, that deals with call recordings extracted from inbound
or outbound flows. First, we illustrate in detail the development of an
in-house speech-to-text solution, based on Kaldi framework, and evaluate its
performance (and compare it to Google Cloud Speech API). Then, we evaluate and
compare different approaches to the semantic tagging of call transcripts,
ranging from classic regular expressions to machine learning models based on
ngrams and logistic regression, and propose a combination of them, which is
shown to provide a consistent benefit. Finally, a decision tree inducer, called
J48S, is applied to the problem of tagging. Such an algorithm is natively
capable of exploiting sequential data, such as texts, for classification
purposes. The solution is compared with the other approaches and is shown to
provide competitive classification performances, while generating highly
interpretable models and reducing the complexity of the data preparation phase.
The potential operational impact of the whole process is thoroughly examined.

an object detector generalizing to a novel domain free of annotations. Recent
advances align class-conditional distributions by narrowing down cross-domain
prototypes (class centers). Though great success,they ignore the significant
within-class variance and the domain-mismatched semantics within the training
batch, leading to a sub-optimal adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel SemantIc-complete Graph MAtching (SIGMA) framework for DAOD,
which completes mismatched semantics and reformulates the adaptation with graph
matching. Specifically, we design a Graph-embedded Semantic Completion module
(GSC) that completes mismatched semantics through generating hallucination
graph nodes in missing categories. Then, we establish cross-image graphs to
model class-conditional distributions and learn a graph-guided memory bank for
better semantic completion in turn. After representing the source and target
data as graphs, we reformulate the adaptation as a graph matching problem,
i.e., finding well-matched node pairs across graphs to reduce the domain gap,
which is solved with a novel Bipartite Graph Matching adaptor (BGM). In a
nutshell, we utilize graph nodes to establish semantic-aware node affinity and
leverage graph edges as quadratic constraints in a structure-aware matching
loss, achieving fine-grained adaptation with a node-to-node graph matching.
Extensive experiments verify that SIGMA outperforms existing works
significantly. Our code is available at

graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art methods for

dependencies between items can not be captured effectively due to the
limitation of GNNs. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel approach
for session-based recommendation, called Transition Relation Aware
Self-Attention (TRASA). Specifically, TRASA first converts the session to a
graph and then encodes the shortest path between items through the gated
recurrent unit as their transition relation. Then, to capture the long-range
dependencies, TRASA utilizes the self-attention mechanism to build the direct
connection between any two items without going through intermediate ones. Also,
the transition relations are incorporated explicitly when computing the
attention scores. Extensive experiments on three real-word datasets demonstrate
that TRASA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods consistently.

text instances by classifying different texts into instance-independent feature
maps, meanwhile avoiding the complex aggregation process existing in
segmentation-based arbitrary shape text detection methods. To be concrete, our
KPN will predict a Gaussian center map for each text image, which will be used
to extract a series of candidate kernel proposals (i.e., dynamic convolution
kernel) from the embedding feature maps according to their corresponding
keypoint positions. To enforce the independence between kernel proposals, we
propose a novel orthogonal learning loss (OLL) via orthogonal constraints.
Specifically, our kernel proposals contain important self-information learned

proposals will individually convolve all embedding feature maps for generating
individual embedded maps of text instances. In this way, our KPN can
effectively separate neighboring text instances and improve the robustness

devices operate at incontestable speed, they are one dimensional (1D)
diffraction devices depending on analog serial data transfer and as such have a
mode of use distinguished from common 2D spatial light modulators. Combination
with an amplified laser source allows to clock the serial buildup of AO
diffraction patterns for avoidance of phase aberration in the output beam due
to acoustic wave progression. Pseudo 2D holography is established with two
crossed AO deflectors for biaxial spatial modulation of the input phase, and
optionally also of its amplitude. In this configuration, acousto-optics permits
light patterning into micrometer-scale 2D point grids with the possibility to
switch the pattern between individual laser pulses. We describe algorithms for

deep learning has made a remarkable advances in super-resolution techniques,
typical convolutional architectures limit upscaling factors to specific output
resolutions in training. Recent work has shown that a continuous representation
of an image and learning its implicit function enable almost limitless
upscaling. However, the detailed approach, predicting values (depths) for
neighbor pixels in the input and then linearly interpolating them, does not
best fit the LiDAR range images since it does not fill the unmeasured details
but creates a new image with regression in a high-dimensional space. In
addition, the linear interpolation blurs sharp edges providing important
boundary information of objects in 3-D points. To handle these problems, we
propose a novel network, Implicit LiDAR Network (ILN), which learns not the
values per pixels but weights in the interpolation so that the superresolution
can be done by blending the input pixel depths but with non-linear weights.
Also, the weights can be considered as attentions from the query to the
neighbor pixels, and thus an attention module in the recent Transformer
architecture can be leveraged. Our experiments with a novel large-scale

prunes, and aggregates the encodings of observed entities to extract features.
Second, distinct from the well-known attention mechanism, ConcNet has a unique
motivational subnetwork to explicitly consider the motivational indices when
scoring the observed entities. Furthermore, we present a concentration policy
gradient architecture that can learn effective policies in LMAS from scratch.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented architecture has excellent
scalability and flexibility, and significantly outperforms existing methods on
LMAS benchmarks.

painstaking efforts to review many existing apps with similar purposes. The
review process is crucial in the sense that it reduces market risks and

  Following the conception of storyboard in movie production, we propose a

Android apps with rich features through reverse engineering, and assist
different roles to review and analyze apps effectively and efficiently.
Specifically, we (1) propose a hybrid method to extract a relatively complete
Activity transition graph (ATG), that is, it first extracts the ATG of Android
apps through static analysis method first, and further leverages dynamic
component exploration to augment ATG; (2) extract the required inter-component

analysis and renders UI pages dynamically by using app instrumentation together
with the extracted required ICC data; (3) obtain rich features including
comprehensive ATG with rendered UI pages, semantic activity names,
corresponding logic and layout code, etc. (4) implement the storyboard
visualization as a web service with the rendered UI pages and the corresponding
rich features. Our experiments unveil that StoryDistiller is effective and
indeed useful to assist app exploration and review. We also conduct a
comprehensive comparison study to demonstrate better performance over IC3,

into individual frames to detect and segment objects frame by frame. However,
such a frame-in frame-out (FiFo) pipeline is ineffective to exploit the
temporal information. Based on the fact that adjacent frames in a short clip
are highly coherent in content, we propose to extend the one-stage FiFo
framework to a clip-in clip-out (CiCo) one, which performs VIS clip by clip.
Specifically, we stack FPN features of all frames in a short video clip to
build a spatio-temporal feature cube, and replace the 2D conv layers in the
prediction heads and the mask branch with 3D conv layers, forming clip-level
prediction heads (CPH) and clip-level mask heads (CMH). Then the clip-level
masks of an instance can be generated by feeding its box-level predictions from
CPH and clip-level features from CMH into a small fully convolutional network.
A clip-level segmentation loss is proposed to ensure that the generated
instance masks are temporally coherent in the clip. The proposed CiCo strategy
is free of inter-frame alignment, and can be easily embedded into existing FiFo
based VIS approaches. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our CiCo
strategy, we apply it to two representative FiFo methods, Yolact
\cite{bolya2019yolact} and CondInst \cite{tian2020conditional}, resulting in
two new one-stage VIS models, namely CiCo-Yolact and CiCo-CondInst, which
achieve 37.1/37.3\%, 35.2/35.4\% and 17.2/18.0\% mask AP using the ResNet50

process: DL-based detection of common interpolation (INT) and double structure
(DS) artifacts, followed by conditional inpainting applied to the artifact
areas. In this context, conditional refers to a guidance of the inpainting
process by patient-specific image data to ensure anatomically reliable results.
The study is based on 65 in-house 4D CT images of lung cancer patients (48 with
only slight artifacts, 17 with pronounced artifacts) and two publicly available
4D CT data sets that serve as independent external test sets. Automated
artifact detection revealed a ROC-AUC of 0.99 for INT and of 0.97 for DS
artifacts (in-house data). The proposed inpainting method decreased the average
root mean squared error (RMSE) by 52%(INT) and 59% (DS) for the in-house data.
For the external test data sets, the RMSE improvement is similar (50% and 59 %,
respectively). Applied to 4D CT data with pronounced artifacts (not part of the
training set), 72% of the detectable artifacts were removed. The results
highlight the potential of DL-based inpainting for restoration of

large number of energy eigenstates, exponential in the Bekenstein-Hawking

$H(G)$ and the Harish-Chandra--Schwartz algebra $S(G)$. We compute the
Hochschild homology groups of $H(G)$ and of $S(G)$, and we describe the
outcomes in several ways.
  Our main tools are algebraic families of smooth $G$-representations. With
those we construct maps from $HH_n (H(G))$ and $HH_n (S(G))$ to modules of
differential $n$-forms on affine varieties. For $n = 0$ this provides a
description of the cocentres of these algebras in terms of nice linear
functions on the Grothendieck group of finite length (tempered)
$G$-representations.
  It is known from earlier work that every Bernstein ideal $H(G)^s$ of $H(G)$
is closely related to a crossed product algebra of the from $O(T) \rtimes W$.
Here $O(T)$ denotes the regular functions on the variety $T$ of unramified
characters of a Levi subgroup $L$ of $G$, and $W$ is a finite group acting on
$T$. We make this relation even stronger by establishing an isomorphism between
$HH_* (H(G)^s)$ and $HH_* (O(T) \rtimes W)$, although we have to say that in
some cases it is necessary to twist $C[W]$ by a 2-cocycle.
  Similarly we prove that the Hochschild homology of the two-sided ideal
$S(G)^s$ of $S(G)$ is isomorphic to $HH_* (C^\infty (T_u) \rtimes W)$, where
$T_u$ denotes the Lie group of unitary unramified characters of $L$. In these
pictures of $HH_* (H(G))$ and $HH_* (S(G))$ we also show how the Bernstein
centre of $H(G)$ acts.
  Finally, we derive similar expressions for the (periodic) cyclic homology
groups of $H(G)$ and of $S(G)$ and we relate that to topological K-theory.

proposed MS-DCEE approach uses the current and future input to not only drive
the agent towards the estimated source location (exploitation) but also reduce
its estimation uncertainty (exploration) by actively learning the operational
environment. Unknown source target position, together with unknown environment,
impose significant challenges in establishing the recursive feasibility and the

property of Bayesian estimation, we develop a two-step approach where the
unbiasedness of the mean estimation is assumed first and then the randomness of
the mean estimate under each collected information sequence is accounted. Based
on that, we develop a MS-DCEE scheme with suitable terminal ingredients where
recursive feasibility and convergence are guaranteed. Two simulation scenarios
are conducted, which show that the proposed MS-DCEE algorithm outperforms the

objects is a challenging topic in machine learning. The challenges mainly stem
from that the interacting systems are exponentially-compositional, symmetrical,
and commonly geometrically-constrained. Current methods, particularly the ones
based on equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have targeted on the first
two challenges but remain immature for constrained systems. In this paper, we
propose Graph Mechanics Network (GMN) which is combinatorially efficient,
equivariant and constraint-aware. The core of GMN is that it represents, by
generalized coordinates, the forward kinematics information (positions and
velocities) of a structural object. In this manner, the geometrical constraints
are implicitly and naturally encoded in the forward kinematics. Moreover, to
allow equivariant message passing in GMN, we have developed a general form of
orthogonality-equivariant functions, given that the dynamics of constrained
systems are more complicated than the unconstrained counterparts.
Theoretically, the proposed equivariant formulation is proved to be universally
expressive under certain conditions. Extensive experiments support the
advantages of GMN compared to the state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of prediction
accuracy, constraint satisfaction and data efficiency on the simulated systems
consisting of particles, sticks and hinges, as well as two real-world datasets

row of pixels from instant global shutter (GS) frames over time during the
exposure of the RS camera. This means that the information of each instant GS
frame is partially, yet sequentially, embedded into the row-dependent
distortion. Inspired by this fact, we address the challenging task of reversing
this process, i.e., extracting undistorted GS frames from images suffering from
RS distortion. However, since RS distortion is coupled with other factors such
as readout settings and the relative velocity of scene elements to the camera,
models that only exploit the geometric correlation between temporally adjacent
images suffer from poor generality in processing data with different readout
settings and dynamic scenes with both camera motion and object motion. In this
paper, instead of two consecutive frames, we propose to exploit a pair of
images captured by dual RS cameras with reversed RS directions for this highly
challenging task. Grounded on the symmetric and complementary nature of dual
reversed distortion, we develop a novel end-to-end model, IFED, to generate
dual optical flow sequence through iterative learning of the velocity field
during the RS time. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IFED is
superior to naive cascade schemes, as well as the state-of-the-art which
utilizes adjacent RS images. Most importantly, although it is trained on a
synthetic dataset, IFED is shown to be effective at retrieving GS frame
sequences from real-world RS distorted images of dynamic scenes. Code is

how much the form on $X$ must be dilated in order for it to admit an embedded
ellipsoid of eccentricity $z$. In most cases there are just finitely many
obstructions to such an embedding besides the volume. If there are infinitely
many obstructions, $X$ is said to have a staircase. This paper gives an almost
complete description of the staircases in the ellipsoidal capacity functions of
the symplectic Hirzebruch surfaces $H_b$ formed by blowing up the projective
plane with weight $b$. We describe an interweaving, recursively defined, family
of obstructions to symplectic embeddings of ellipsoids that show there is an
open dense set of shape parameters $b$ that are blocked, i.e. have no
staircase, and an uncountable number of other values of $b$ that do admit
staircases. The remaining $b$-values form a countable sequence of special
rational numbers that are closely related to the symmetries discussed in
Magill--McDuff (arXiv:2106.09143). We show that none of them admit ascending
staircases. Conjecturally, none admit descending staircases. Finally, we show
that, as long as $b$ is not one of these special rational values, any staircase

nuclear isomers with an ultra-high peak efficiency of $1.76\times10^{15}$

enhancing the precision, or equivalently reducing the uncertainty of the
regression results is undoubtedly one of the central goals. Here, somewhat
surprisingly, we find that the unfavorable regression uncertainty in performing
regression tasks of inverse statistical problems actually contains ""hidden""
information concerning phase transitions of the system under consideration. By
utilizing this ""hidden"" information, we develop a new unsupervised machine
learning approach dubbed ""learning from regression uncertainty"" for automated
detection of phases of matter, with the core working horse being a neural
network performing regression tasks instead of classification tasks as in
various related machine learning approaches developed so far. This is achieved
by revealing an intrinsic connection between regression uncertainty and
response properties of the system under consideration, thus making the results
of this machine learning approach directly interpretable. We demonstrate the
approach by identifying the critical point of the ferromagnetic Ising model and
revealing the existence of the intermediate phase in the six-state and
seven-state clock models. Our approach paves the way towards intriguing
possibilities for unveiling new physics via machine learning in an
interpretable manner.

sense human mobility almost in real time using unconventional methods (e.g.,
number of bikes in a bike station). Due to the diffusion of such technologies,
the last years have witnessed a significant growth of human mobility studies,
motivated by their importance in a wide range of applications, from traffic
management to public security and computational epidemiology. A mobility task
that is becoming prominent is crowd flow prediction, i.e., forecasting
aggregated incoming and outgoing flows in the locations of a geographic region.
Although several deep learning approaches have been proposed to solve this
problem, their usage is limited to specific types of spatial tessellations and
cannot provide sufficient explanations of their predictions. We propose
CrowdNet, a solution to crowd flow prediction based on graph convolutional
networks. Compared with state-of-the-art solutions, CrowdNet can be used with
regions of irregular shapes and provide meaningful explanations of the
predicted crowd flows. We conduct experiments on public data varying the
spatio-temporal granularity of crowd flows to show the superiority of our model
with respect to existing methods, and we investigate CrowdNet's reliability to
missing or noisy input data. Our model is a step forward in the design of
reliable deep learning models to predict and explain human displacements in
urban environments.

  thermal energy storage based on an entire domain model",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn nlin.CD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Phase change energy storage is getting increasing attention as a
representative technology to achieve carbon neutrality. The phase change
process exists typical phenomenon of asymmetry that affects the energy storage
performance. However, the mechanism of asymmetry is currently lack of
elaboration because the half domain model is always used to simplify the
numerical simulation and avoid the appearance of asymmetry. In this study, the
entire domain model and boundary conditions were adopted and numerically
simulated for the melting process of paraffin wax, i.e., the charging process
of energy storage. The nonlinear dynamics method was applied to explain the
asymmetric flow and heat transfer phenomenon. The three-stage characteristic
based on charging speed was proposed for charging process and was explained by
thermal conduction or natural convection. The asymmetric phenomenon was
elaborated on the cause of formation, change mechanism, and effect evaluation.
Results show that natural convection accounts for the multiple solutions
(including the asymmetric ones) of charging process. It is also pointed out
that asymmetric solutions can exist under symmetric geometry structure. To
accurately solve the charging process, it is necessary to use the entire domain
model. Both the charging speed and energy storage capacity have a positive
correlation with asymmetry. Thus, a potential idea for energy storage
application was proposed to increase the charging speed; that is, adding
thermal disturbance during the melting process to destroy flow stability and to
enhance convective heat transfer. The research methods and findings will
support the development of energy storage and numerical investigation in other
related areas.

layer in a recurrent fashion along a sequence, and has linear complexity with
respect to sequence length. Our recurrent cell operates on blocks of tokens
rather than single tokens during training, and leverages parallel computation
within a block in order to make efficient use of accelerator hardware. The cell
itself is strikingly simple. It is merely a transformer layer: it uses
self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function
over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part
by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM
cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has
the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional
transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language
modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range
Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We
demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source
code. Our code has been released as open source.

through a quantum region of spacetime is long overdue. Within the theory of
Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity, we compute the probabilities for a test
light ray to land at different locations after travelling through a
symmetry-reduced box region in 2,3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. It is found that
for fixed boundary conditions, light ray fluctuations are generically large
when all coupling constants are relatively small in absolute value. For fixed
coupling constants, as the boundary size is decreased light ray fluctuations
first increase and then decrease in a 2D theory with the cosmological constant,
Einstein-Hilbert and R-squared terms. While in 3D and 4D theories with the
cosmological constant and Einstein-Hilbert terms, as the boundary size is
decreased light ray fluctuations just increase. Incidentally, when studying 2D
quantum gravity we show that the global time-space duality with the
cosmological constant and Einstein-Hilbert terms noted previously also holds
when arbitrary even powers of the Ricci scalar are added. We close by
discussing how light ray fluctuations can be used in obtaining the continuum

However, thermal responses to airborne ultrasounds have not been extensively

on a mesh screen enabled the real-time visualization of three-dimensional

demonstrate that thermography observations based on ultrasound-temperature

thermal conduction in low-dimensional solids like nanotubes and nanowires. In
these systems the thermal energy is carried by phonons, i.e. propagating
lattice oscillations that interact via nonlinear resonance. The average energy
transfer between the phonons is described by the wave kinetic equation (WKE),
derived directly from the microscopic dynamics. Here, we use the spatially
nonhomogeneous WKE of the prototypical $\beta-$ Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT)
model, equipped with thermostats able to set different temperatures at the two
ends. Our main findings are as follows: (i) The anomalous scaling of the
conductivity with the system size, in close agreement with the known results
from the microscopic dynamics, is due to a nontrivial interplay between high
and low wavenumbers. (ii) The high-wavenumber phonons relax to local
thermodynamic equilibrium transporting energy diffusively, {\it \`a la
Fourier}. (iii) The low-wavenumber phonons are nearly noninteracting and
transfer energy ballistically; this latter phenomenon is the analogous of the
second sound emission, observed for example in superfluids.
