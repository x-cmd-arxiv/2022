transmon qubit architectures. Although these architectures have demonstrated
remarkable improvements in recent years, further improvements in performance
through materials engineering will aid in large-scale deployment. Here, we use
information retrieved from secondary ion mass spectrometry and electron
microscopy to conduct a detailed assessment of the surface oxide that forms in
ambient conditions for transmon test qubit devices patterned from a niobium
film. We observe that this oxide exhibits a varying stoichiometry with NbO and
NbO$_2$ found closer to the niobium film and Nb$_2$O$_5$ found closer to the
surface. In terms of structural analysis, we find that the Nb$_2$O$_5$ region
is semicrystalline in nature and exhibits randomly oriented grains on the order
of 1-2 nm corresponding to monoclinic N-Nb$_2$O$_5$ that are dispersed
throughout an amorphous matrix. Using fluctuation electron microscopy, we are
able to map the relative crystallinity in the Nb$_2$O$_5$ region with nanometer
spatial resolution. Through this correlative method, we observe that amorphous
regions are more likely to contain oxygen vacancies and exhibit weaker bonds
between the niobium and oxygen atoms. Based on these findings, we expect that
oxygen vacancies likely serve as a decoherence mechanism in quantum systems.

argue that weak augmentations matter to represent a more reliable relation, and
leverage momentum strategy for practical efficiency. The designed asymmetric

computationally estimating the time to freezing as well as the phase along the

different applications, for example, in combinatorics and optimization. The
focus of this article are families of hyperbolic polynomials which are
determined through $k$ linear conditions on the coefficients. The coefficients
corresponding to such a family of hyperbolic polynomials form a semi-algebraic
set which we call a \emph{hyperbolic slice}. We initiate here the study of the
geometry of these objects in more detail. The set of hyperbolic polynomials is
naturally stratified with respect to the multiplicities of the real zeros and
this stratification induces also a stratification on the hyperbolic slices. Our
main focus here is on the \emph{local extreme points} of hyperbolic slices,
i.e., the local extreme points of linear functionals, and we show that these
correspond precisely to those hyperbolic polynomials in the hyperbolic slice
which have at most $k$ distinct roots and we can show that generically the
convex hull of such a family is a polyhedron. Building on these results, we
give consequences of our results to the study of symmetric real varieties and

turn allows for algorithmic simplifications, for example, to verify that such

describes how to extract the input-dependent part from the lumped ULM dynamics

theory that plays a central role in Robertson and Seymour's graph minor
project, and hierarchical clustering. Tangles cannot only be defined for
graphs, but in fact for arbitrary connectivity functions, which are functions
defined on the subsets of some finite universe. In typical clustering
applications these universes consist of points in some metric space.
Connectivity functions are usually required to be submodular. It is our first
contribution to show that the central duality theorem connecting tangles with
hierarchical decompositions (so-called branch decompositions) also holds if
submodularity is replaced by a different property that we call
maximum-submodular. We then define a connectivity function on finite data sets
in an arbitrary metric space and prove that its tangles are in one-to-one
correspondence with the clusters obtained by applying the well-known single
linkage clustering algorithms to the same data set. Lastly we generalize this
correspondence for any hierarchical clustering. We show that the data structure
that represents hierarchical clustering results, called dendograms, are
equivalent to maximum-submodular connectivity functions and their tangles. The
idea of viewing tangles as clusters has first been proposed by Diestel and
Whittle in 2016 as an approach to image segmentation. To the best of our
knowledge, our result is the first that establishes a precise technical
connection between tangles and clusters.

computable sampling method, outliers must appear. We present a simple proof to
the outlier theorem, with exponentially improved bounds. We extend the outlier
theorem to ergodic dynamical systems which are guaranteed to hit ever larger
outlier states with diminishing measures. We show how to construct
deterministic functions from random ones, i.e. function derandomization. We
also prove that all open sets of the Cantor space with large uniform measure

(NAS) has drawn increasing attention in the recent past. Thereby, the
predominant research objective is to reduce the necessity of costly evaluations
of neural architectures while efficiently exploring large search spaces. To
this aim, surrogate models embed architectures in a latent space and predict
their performance, while generative models for neural architectures enable
optimization-based search within the latent space the generator draws from.
Both, surrogate and generative models, have the aim of facilitating
query-efficient search in a well-structured latent space. In this paper, we
further improve the trade-off between query-efficiency and promising
architecture generation by leveraging advantages from both, efficient surrogate
models and generative design. To this end, we propose a generative model,
paired with a surrogate predictor, that iteratively learns to generate samples
from increasingly promising latent subspaces. This approach leads to very
effective and efficient architecture search, while keeping the query amount
low. In addition, our approach allows in a straightforward manner to jointly
optimize for multiple objectives such as accuracy and hardware latency. We show
the benefit of this approach not only w.r.t. the optimization of architectures
for highest classification accuracy but also in the context of hardware
constraints and outperform state-of-the-art methods on several NAS benchmarks
for single and multiple objectives. We also achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ImageNet. The code is available at

deep learning, the robustness of neural networks remains an open issue.
Specifically, a small adversarial perturbation on the input may cause the model
to produce a completely different output. Such poor robustness implies many
potential hazards, especially in security-critical applications, e.g.,
autonomous driving and mobile robotics. This work studies what information the
adversarially trained model focuses on. Empirically, we notice that the
differences between the clean and adversarial data are mainly distributed in
the low-frequency region. We then find that an adversarially-trained model is
more robust than its naturally-trained counterpart due to the reason that the
former pays more attention to learning the dominant information in
low-frequency components. In addition, we consider two common ways to improve
model robustness, namely, by data augmentation and by using stronger network
architectures, and understand these techniques from a frequency-domain
perspective. We are hopeful this work can shed light on the design of more

mechanisms to enable service robots to be aware of and react to anomalies
(i.e., unexpected deviations from intended outcomes) that arise during the
execution of these tasks. Detection and identification of these anomalies is an
essential step towards fulfilling these requirements. Although several
architectures are proposed for anomaly detection, identification is not yet
thoroughly investigated. This task is challenging since indicators may appear
long before anomalies are detected. In this paper, we propose a ConvoLUtional
threE-stream Anomaly Identification (CLUE-AI) framework to address this
problem. The framework fuses visual, auditory and proprioceptive data streams
to identify everyday object manipulation anomalies. A stream of 2D images
gathered through an RGB-D camera placed on the head of the robot is processed
within a self-attention enabled visual stage to capture visual anomaly
indicators. The auditory modality provided by the microphone placed on the
robot's lower torso is processed within a designed convolutional neural network
(CNN) in the auditory stage. Last, the force applied by the gripper and the
gripper state are processed within a CNN to obtain proprioceptive features.
These outputs are then combined with a late fusion scheme. Our novel
three-stream framework design is analyzed on everyday object manipulation tasks
with a Baxter humanoid robot in a semi-structured setting. The results indicate
that the framework achieves an f-score of 94% outperforming the other baselines
in classifying anomalies that arise during runtime.

variance in a large window. In other words, counting the points of a
hyperuniform point process that fall in a given large region yields a
small-variance Monte Carlo estimation of the volume. Hyperuniform point
processes have received a lot of attention in statistical physics, both for the
investigation of natural organized structures and the synthesis of materials.
Unfortunately, rigorously proving that a point process is hyperuniform is
usually difficult. A common practice in statistical physics and chemistry is to
use a few samples to estimate a spectral measure called the structure factor.
Its decay around zero provides a diagnostic of hyperuniformity. Different
applied fields use however different estimators, and important algorithmic
choices proceed from each field's lore. This paper provides a systematic survey
and derivation of known or otherwise natural estimators of the structure
factor. We also leverage the consistency of these estimators to contribute the
first asymptotically valid statistical test of hyperuniformity. We benchmark
all estimators and hyperuniformity diagnostics on a set of examples. In an
effort to make investigations of the structure factor and hyperuniformity
systematic and reproducible, we further provide the Python toolbox
structure_factor, containing all the estimators and tools that we discuss.

3.2{\times}10^{-2}~$km$^{-2}~$yr$^{-1}~$sr$^{-1}$ and $\simeq
8.7{\times}10^{-2}~$km$^{-2}~$yr$^{-1}~$sr$^{-1}$. The all-sky average value
amounts to $\simeq 1.1{\times}10^{-2}~$km$^{-2}~$yr$^{-1}~$sr$^{-1}$ above
$10^{17}~$eV and decreases roughly as $E^{-2}$, making this diffuse flux the
dominant one from cosmic-ray interactions for energy thresholds between
$10^{17}~$eV and $10^{18}$~eV. Compared to the current sensitivities of
detection techniques, a gain between two and three orders of magnitude in
exposure is required for a detection below $\simeq 10^{18}$~eV. The
implications for searches for photon fluxes from the Galactic center that would
be indicative of the decay of super-heavy dark matter particles are discussed,
as the photon flux presented in this study can be considered as a floor below
which other signals would be overwhelmed.

based on the substitutions of cations and anions sitting over B and X-sites of
the FrBX3 compounds. The high absorption coefficient, low reflectivity, and
high optical conductivity make these materials suitable for photovoltaic and

The inflaton was not a cosmological constant, as indicated by the fact that
inflation ended and by the Planck satellite's constraint of $n_s\neq 1$ at
$8\sigma$ confidence. Therefore, it is interesting to verify whether its
equation of state parameter was measurably different from $-1$. We analyze this
question for a class of single-field slow-roll inflationary models, where the
hierarchy of Hubble slow-roll parameters is truncated at different orders.
Based on the latest Planck and BICEP2/Keck data, we obtain a $68\%$ upper bound
of $1+w < 0.0014$ for the three-parameter model, which gives the best
description to the data. This provides a cautionary tale for drawing
conclusions about the nature of today's dark energy based upon the
non-detection of a deviation from $w=-1$ with current and upcoming cosmological

this work, we propose a representation learning framework called X-Learner,

X-Learner learns the task-specific feature to alleviate task interference and
enrich the representation by reconciliation layer. 2) Squeeze Stage: X-Learner

by observational data and allow us to identify a plausible fossil group sample

for both neutrino detection and searches for baryon number violating processes.
The next generation of large neutrino detectors will seek to improve upon the

that use diverse forms of sentence-external context (including metadata) by
eliminating the need to jointly train sentence-external and within-sentence
encoders. Our approach, contextual universal embeddings (CUE), trains LMs on
one set of context, such as date and author, and adapts to novel metadata
types, such as article title, or previous sentence. The model consists of a
pretrained neural sentence LM, a BERT-based context encoder, and a masked
transformer decoder that estimates LM probabilities using sentence-internal and
sentence-external information. When context or metadata are unavailable, our
model learns to combine contextual and sentence-internal information using
noisy oracle unigram embeddings as a proxy. Real contextual information can be
introduced later and used to adapt a small number of parameters that map
contextual data into the decoder's embedding space. We validate the CUE
framework on a NYTimes text corpus with multiple metadata types, for which the
LM perplexity can be lowered from 36.6 to 27.4 by conditioning on context.
Bootstrapping a contextual LM with only a subset of the context/metadata during
training retains 85\% of the achievable gain. Training the model initially with
proxy context retains 67% of the perplexity gain after adapting to real
context. Furthermore, we can swap one type of pretrained sentence LM for
another without retraining the context encoders, by only adapting the decoder
model. Overall, we obtain a modular framework that allows incremental, scalable
training of context-enhanced LMs.

into multiple smaller classes with more specific responsibilities. To do this,
we first construct a graph of methods (as nodes) for the concerning god class.
The edge between any two methods is determined by their structural similarity,

learn a vector representation for each method. Finally, the learned vectors are
used to cluster methods into different groups to be recommended as refactored

evolutionary algorithms, where the (1+1) EA is one of the most investigated. We
extend this algorithm by introducing some problem knowledge with a specialized
mutation operator which works under the assumption that the number of 1s of a
solution is critical, as frequently happens in combinatorial optimization. This
slight modification increases the chance to correct wrongly placed bits while
preserving the simplicity and problem independence of the (1+1) EA. As an
application of our algorithm we examine the vertex cover problem on certain
instances, where we show that it leads to asymptotically better runtimes and
even finds with higher probability optimal solutions in comparison with the
usual (1+1) EA. Precisely, we compare the performance of both algorithms on
paths and on complete bipartite graphs of size $n$. Regarding the path we prove
that, for a particular initial configuration, the \alg1+1 takes in expectation
$\Theta(n^4)$ iterations while the modification reduces this to $\Theta(n^3)$,
and present experimental evidence that such a configuration is reached.
Concerning the complete bipartite graph our modification finds the optimum in
polynomial time with probability $1-1/2^{\Omega(n^\xi)}$ for every positive
constant $\xi < 1$, which improves the known probability of

disciplines, the characterization of their computations and the origin of key
properties such as generalization and robustness remain open questions. Recent
literature suggests that robust networks with good generalization properties
tend to be biased towards processing low frequencies in images. To explore the
frequency bias hypothesis further, we develop an algorithm that allows us to
learn modulatory masks highlighting the essential input frequencies needed for
preserving a trained network's performance. We achieve this by imposing
invariance in the loss with respect to such modulations in the input
frequencies. We first use our method to test the low-frequency preference
hypothesis of adversarially trained or data-augmented networks. Our results
suggest that adversarially robust networks indeed exhibit a low-frequency bias
but we find this bias is also dependent on directions in frequency space.
However, this is not necessarily true for other types of data augmentation. Our
results also indicate that the essential frequencies in question are
effectively the ones used to achieve generalization in the first place.
Surprisingly, images seen through these modulatory masks are not recognizable
and resemble texture-like patterns.

radiate RHNs via Hawking evaporation late in the Universe's evolution when the
temperature of the thermal plasma is low relative to the RHN mass.
Subsequently, these RHNs can decay and produce a lepton asymmetry while the

models, quantum many-body scars (QMBS) can offer deep insights into the
thermalization dynamics of gauge theories. Having been first discovered in a
spin-$1/2$ quantum link formulation of the Schwinger model, it is a fundamental
question as to whether QMBS persist for $S>1/2$ since such theories converge to
the lattice Schwinger model in the large-$S$ limit, which is the appropriate
version of lattice QED in one spatial dimension. In this work, we address this
question by exploring QMBS in spin-$S$ $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link models
(QLMs) with staggered fermions. We find that QMBS persist at $S>1/2$, with the
resonant scarring regime, which occurs for a zero-mass quench, arising from
simple high-energy gauge-invariant initial states. We furthermore find evidence
of detuned scarring regimes, which occur for finite-mass quenches starting in
the physical vacua and the charge-proliferated state. Our results conclusively
show that QMBS exist in a wide class of lattice gauge theories in one spatial
dimension represented by spin-$S$ QLMs coupled to dynamical fermions.

cosmologically favoured mass range. The required small decay constant, $f_a\ll
M_P$, can be implemented by using a large compactification volume. This points
to the Large Volume Scenario which in turn makes certain cosmological
predictions: First, the closed string axion behaves similarly to a
field-theoretic axion in the pre-inflationary scenario, i.e. the initial value
can be tuned but one is constrained by isocurvature fluctuations. In addition,
the volume represents a long-lived modulus that may lead to an early
matter-dominated phase. Finally, the decay of the volume modulus to its own
axion tends to overproduce dark radiation. In this paper we aim to carefully
analyze the cosmology by studying models that not only allow for a QCD axion
but also include inflation. Quite generally, limits on isocurvature
fluctuations restrict us to relatively low-scale inflation, which in the
present stringy context points to K\""ahler moduli inflation. As a novel feature
we find that the lightest (volume) modulus couples strongly to the Higgs. It
hence quickly decays to the SM, thus resolving the original dark radiation
problem. This decay is much faster than that of the inflaton, implying that
reheating is determined by the inflaton decay. The inflaton could potentially
reintroduce a dark radiation problem since it decays to lighter moduli and
their axions with equal rates. However, due its mixing with the QCD-saxion, the
inflaton has also a direct decay rate to the SM, enhanced by the number of SM
gauge bosons. This results in an amount of dark radiation that is consistent
with present limits but potentially detectable in future measurements.

probe the sizes and structures of these galaxies, which we compare to a control

find that post-starburst galaxies systematically lie $\sim0.1$ dex below the
quiescent mass-size (half-light radius) relation, with a scatter of $\sim0.2$
dex. This finding is bolstered by non-parametric measures, such as the Gini
coefficient and the concentration, which also reveal these galaxies to have
more compact light profiles than both quiescent and star-forming populations at
similar mass and redshift. The sizes of post-starburst galaxies show either
negative or no correlation with the time since quenching, such that more
recently quenched galaxies are larger or similarly sized. This empirical
finding disfavors the formation of post-starburst galaxies via a purely central
burst of star formation that simultaneously shrinks the galaxy and shuts off
star formation. We show that the central densities of post-starburst and
quiescent galaxies at this epoch are very similar, in contrast with their
effective radii. The structural properties of z$\sim$0.7 post-starburst

the single-ion anisotropy interaction using the strong-coupling perturbation

forward-modelling the entire three-dimensional galaxy survey. Our method
naturally and fully self-consistently exploits the entirety of the large-scale

scale-dependent galaxy bias, to extract information on the local
non-Gaussianity parameter, $\fnl$. We demonstrate the performance of our
approach through various tests with mock galaxy data emulating relevant
features of the \sdssiii{}-like survey, and additional tests with a
\textit{Stage IV} mock data set. These tests reveal that the method infers
unbiased values of $\fnl$ by accurately handling survey geometries, noise, and

of $\sigma_{\fnl} \approx 8.78$ for \sdssiii{}-like data, an improvement of a
factor $\sim 2.5$ over currently published constraints. Tests with
next-generation mock data show that significant further improvements are
feasible with sufficiently high resolution. Furthermore, the results

accurate waveform modeling will be necessary for detection and
characterization. Modeling EMRI dynamics requires accounting for effects such
as the ones induced by an external tidal field, which can break integrability
at resonances and cause significant dephasing. In this paper, we use a
Newtonian analogue of a Kerr black hole to study the effect of an external
tidal field on the dynamics and the gravitational waveform. We present a
numerical framework that takes advantage of the integrability of the background
system to evolve it with a symplectic splitting integrator and compute
approximate gravitational waveforms to estimate the timescale over which the
perturbation affects the dynamics. Comparing this timescale with the
characteristic time under radiation reaction at resonance, we introduce a tool
for quantifying the regime in which tidal effects might be included when
modeling EMRI gravitational waves. As an application of this framework, we
perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics at one resonance to show how
different entry points into the resonance in phase-space can produce
substantially different dynamics, and how one can estimate bounds for the
parameter space where tidal effects may become dominant. Such bounds will scale
as $\varepsilon \gtrsim C \, q$, where $\varepsilon$ measures the strength of
the external tidal field, $q$ is the mass ratio, and $C$ is a number which
depends on the resonance and the shape of the tide. We demonstrate how to
estimate $C$ using our framework for the 2:3 radial to polar frequency
resonance in our model system. This framework can serve as a proxy for proper

proposals differ from holographic state complexity proposals in that (1) the
boundary dual is cost, a quantity that can be `optimised' to state complexity,

we build on the Roman HLIS image simulation pipeline in Troxel et al. 2021 to
incorporate several new realistic processing-pipeline updates necessary to more
accurately process the imaging data and calibrate the shear. We show the first
results of this calibration for six deg$^2$ of the simulated reference HLIS
using Metacalibration and compare these results to measurements on more simple,
faster Roman-like image simulations. In both cases, we neglect the impact of
blending of objects. We find that in the simplified simulations,
Metacalibration can calibrate shapes to be within $m=(-0.01\pm 0.10)$%. When
applied to the current most-realistic version of the simulations, the precision
is much lower, with estimates of $m=(-1.34\pm 0.67)$% for joint multi-band

orbital periods up to $\approx 100$ d are often thought to be formed through
common envelope evolution which is still poorly understood. To provide new
observational constraints on the physical processes involved in the formation
of these objects, we are conducting a large-scale survey of close binaries
consisting of a white dwarf and an A to K-type companion. Here we present three
systems with eccentric orbits and orbital periods between $\approx10-42$ d
discovered by our survey. Based on HST spectroscopy and high angular resolution
images obtained with SPHERE-IRDIS, we find that two of these systems are most
likely triple systems while the remaining one could be either a binary or a
hierarchical triple but none of them is a post common envelope binary (PCEB).
The discovery of these systems shows that our survey is capable to detect
systems with orbital periods of the order of weeks, but all six PCEBs we have
previously discovered have periods below 2.5 d. We suggest that the fact that
all of the systems we identify with periods of the order of weeks are not PCEBs
indicates a transition between two different mechanisms responsible for the
formation of very close ($\lesssim 10$ d) and somewhat wider WD+AFGK binaries:
common envelope evolution and non-conservative stable mass transfer.

disorder parameter (TDP), to characterize gapped quantum phases with global
internal symmetry in (2+1)d. TDP is defined as the constant correction that
appears in the ground state expectation value of a partial symmetry
transformation applied to a connected spatial region $M$, the absolute value of
which scales generically as $\exp(-\alpha l+\gamma)$ where $l$ is the perimeter
of $M$ and $\gamma$ is the TDP. Motivated by a topological quantum field theory
interpretation of the operator, we show that $e^\gamma$ can be related to the
quantum dimension of the symmetry defect, and provide a general formula for
$\gamma$ when the entanglement Hamiltonian of the topological phase can be
described by a (1+1)d conformal field theory (CFT). A special case of TDP is
equivalent to the topological R\'enyi entanglement entropy when the symmetry is
the cyclic permutation of the replica of the gapped phase. We then investigate
several examples of lattice models of topological phases, both analytically and
numerically, in particular when the assumption of having a CFT edge theory is
not satisfied. We also consider an example of partial translation symmetry in
Wen's plaquette model and show that the result can be understood using the edge
CFT. Our results establish a new tool to detect quantum topological order.

Algorithm (MO-RV-GOMEA) has been proven effective and efficient in solving

cancer brachytherapy, an internal form of radiation treatment, for which
equally important clinical aims from a base protocol are grouped into two
objectives and bi-objectively optimized. This use of MO-RV-GOMEA was recently
successfully introduced into clinical practice. Brachytherapy can also play an
important role in treating cervical cancer. However, using the same approach to
optimize treatment plans often does not immediately lead to clinically
desirable results. Concordantly, medical experts indicate that they use
additional aims beyond the cervix base protocol. Moreover, these aims have
different priorities and can be patient-specifically adjusted. For this reason,
we propose a novel adaptive objective configuration method to use with
MO-RV-GOMEA so that we can accommodate additional aims of this nature. Based on
results using only the base protocol, in consultation with medical experts, we
configured key additional aims. We show how, for 10 patient cases, the new

additional aims. Consequently, plans resulting from the new approach are
preferred by medical specialists in 8/10 cases.

dominant, implying that for the p-wave and d-wave models the smooth component
is by far the dominant contribution to the radiation. Comparing to the Galactic
center excess observed by Fermi-LAT, for all simulated halos the emission is
dominated by the smooth halo contribution. However, it is possible that for
Sommerfeld models, extrapolation down to mass scales below the current

class of models consisting of q-dits on a graph with short range interactions
is sufficient for understanding chaotic behavior. Any such system consists of
large subsystems coupled together by interactions whose relative strength goes
to zero with the subsystem size. In the absence of conservation laws other than
energy, the Hamiltonians of the subsystems form a complete set of commuting
operators. The hydrodynamic variables are the block diagonal matrix elements
$\rho(e(X))$ of the density matrix in the joint eigenbasis of the subsystem
Hamiltonians, averaged over energy bins. To leading order in the inverse
subsystem size, $\rho(e(X); t)$ satisfies a classical stochastic equation,
which for certain systems takes the form of a functional Fokker-Planck
equation. In such systems the time averaged spectral form factors can be
written as a two dimensional Euclidean functional integral, on a space with
multiple disconnected boundaries. The failure of factorization in this
representation is attributable to the time averaging necessary to apply the
hydrodynamic approximation. The bulk Euclidean action is purely topological. We
make tentative explorations of the special properties of the system that are

We analyzed the nature of matter in the wormhole's throat, and in nearby
regions, of these generalized solutions with $n>2$, using three curvature
scalars in the ASG approach, namely, the Ricci scalar, squared Ricci and the
Kretschmann scalar. We have shown that the ASG leads to corrections in the
matter at the wormhole's throat only for the $n=4$ case. For the squared Ricci
and the Kretschmann we find that exotic matter is always necessary, as
previously found for the usual Ellis-Bronnikov. However, for the Ricci scalar
case, we found that ordinary matter is allowed at the throat. Therefore, the
generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole provides to the possibility of having
ordinary matter at the throat in the context of asymptotically safe gravity.

$t_Q$ ranging from less than 100 Myrs to $\sim800$ Myrs. By mapping $t_Q$ and

in our sample have quenched their star-formation from the outside-in or show a
side-to-side/irregular pattern, both consistent with quenching by ram-pressure
stripping. Only three objects show an inside-out quenching pattern, all of
which are at the high-mass end of our sample. At least two of them currently
host an active galactic nucleus. In two post-starbursts, we identify tails of
ionized gas indicating that these objects had their gas stripped by ram
pressure very recently. Post-starburst features are also found in the stripped
regions of galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping in the same clusters,
confirming the link between these classes of objects. Our results point to
ram-pressure stripping as the main driver of fast quenching in these
environments, with active galactic nuclei playing a role at high stellar
masses.

inertia theorized from radiative heat transfer within the regolith. Thus, we
test whether the variation in thermal inertia can be explained by modeling a

that the model in which Phaethon's north and south hemispheres have distinctly
different thermophysical properties can sufficiently explain the
thermal-inertias determined herein. In particular, we find that a boundary

forms of electronically ordered phases that break the native translational
symmetry of the CuO2 planes. The interplay between these orders and the
superconducting ground state, as well as how they arise through doping a Mott
insulator, is essential to decode the mechanisms of high-temperature
superconductivity. Over the years, various forms of electronic liquid crystal
phases including charge/spin stripes and incommensurate charge-density-waves
(CDWs) were found to emerge out of a correlated metallic ground state in
underdoped cuprates. Early theoretical studies also predicted the emergence of
a Coulomb-frustrated 'charge crystal' phase in the very lightly-doped,
insulating limit of the CuO2 planes. Here, we use resonant X-ray scattering,
electron transport, and muon spin rotation measurements to fully resolve the
electronic and magnetic ground state and search for signatures of charge order
in very lightly hole-doped cuprates from the RBa2Cu3O7-d family (RBCO; R: Y or
rare earth). X-ray scattering data from RBCO films reveal a breaking of
translational symmetry more pervasive than was previously known, extending down
to the Mott limit. The ordering vector of this charge crystal state is linearly
connected to the charge-density-waves of underdoped RBCO, suggesting that the
former phase is a precursor to the latter as hole doping is increased. Most
importantly, the coexistence of charge and spin order in RBCO suggests that
this electronic symmetry-breaking state is common to the CuO2 planes in the
very lightly-doped regime. These findings bridge the gap between the Mott
insulating state and the underdoped metallic state and underscore the prominent
role of Coulomb-frustrated electronic phase separation among all cuprates.

simple alternative to splitting the network is to carry out the supervised task
purely on the edge server while compressing and transmitting the full data, and
most approaches have barely outperformed this baseline. This paper proposes a
new approach for discretizing and entropy-coding intermediate feature
activations to efficiently transmit them from the mobile device to the edge
server. We show that a efficient splittable network architecture results from a
three-way tradeoff between (a) minimizing the computation on the mobile device,
(b) minimizing the size of the data to be transmitted, and (c) maximizing the
model's prediction performance. We propose an architecture based on this
tradeoff and train the splittable network and entropy model in a knowledge
distillation framework. In an extensive set of experiments involving three

we show that our approach improves supervised rate-distortion tradeoffs while

individual chips is connected to the notion of Best Possible Obfuscators which

the functionality but hide the gate implementation of the chip. We conjecture
that the addition of random pairs of NOTs between layers of $\hat{N}$ during

are commonly near object boundaries with high uncertainties. However, existing
SS loss functions are not tailored to handle these uncertain pixels during
training, as these pixels are usually treated equally as confidently classified
pixels and cannot be embedded with arbitrary low distortion in Euclidean space,
thereby degenerating the performance of SS. To overcome this problem, this
paper designs a ""Hyperbolic Uncertainty Loss"" (HyperUL), which dynamically
highlights the misclassified and high-uncertainty pixels in Hyperbolic space
during training via the hyperbolic distances. The proposed HyperUL is model
agnostic and can be easily applied to various neural architectures. After
employing HyperUL to three recent SS models, the experimental results on
Cityscapes and UAVid datasets reveal that the segmentation performance of
existing SS models can be consistently improved.

systems in thermal equilibrium and a work distribution arising in a
non-equilibrium process that connects two quantum systems with Hamiltonians
$H_0$ and $H_1=H_0+V$. Building upon these theorems, we present a quantum
algorithm to prepare a purification of the thermal state of $H_1$ at inverse
temperature $\beta \ge 0$ starting from a purification of the thermal state of
$H_0$. The complexity of the quantum algorithm, given by the number of uses of
certain unitaries, is $\tilde {\cal O}(e^{\beta (\Delta \! A- w_l)/2})$, where
$\Delta \! A$ is the free-energy difference between $H_1$ and $H_0,$ and $w_l$
is a work cutoff that depends on the properties of the work distribution and
the approximation error $\epsilon>0$. If the non-equilibrium process is
trivial, this complexity is exponential in $\beta \|V\|$, where $\|V\|$ is the
spectral norm of $V$. This represents a significant improvement of prior
quantum algorithms that have complexity exponential in $\beta \|H_1\|$ in the
regime where $\|V\|\ll \|H_1\|$. The dependence of the complexity in $\epsilon$
varies according to the structure of the quantum systems. It can be exponential
in $1/\epsilon$ in general, but we show it to be sublinear in $1/\epsilon$ if
$H_0$ and $H_1$ commute, or polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ if $H_0$ and $H_1$ are
local spin systems. The possibility of applying a unitary that drives the
system out of equilibrium allows one to increase the value of $w_l$ and improve
the complexity even further. To this end, we analyze the complexity for
preparing the thermal state of the transverse field Ising model using different
non-equilibrium unitary processes and see significant complexity improvements.

CR anisotropy can increase or reduce the number and amplitude of FDs. It is
therefore important to remove its contributions from CR raw data before FD
identification. Recently, an attempt was made, using a combination of Fourier
transformed technique and FD-location machine to address this. Thus, two FD

functions, where variables are encoded using feature maps and model derivatives
are represented using automatic differentiation of quantum circuits. While
previously quantum kernel methods primarily targeted classification tasks, here
we consider their applicability to regression tasks, based on available data
and differential constraints. We use two strategies to approach these problems.
First, we devise a mixed model regression with a trial solution represented by
kernel-based functions, which is trained to minimize a loss for specific
differential constraints or datasets. Second, we use support vector regression
that accounts for the structure of differential equations. The developed
methods are capable of solving both linear and nonlinear systems. Contrary to
prevailing hybrid variational approaches for parametrized quantum circuits, we
perform training of the weights of the model classically. Under certain
conditions this corresponds to a convex optimization problem, which can be
solved with provable convergence to global optimum of the model. The proposed
approaches also favor hardware implementations, as optimization only uses
evaluated Gram matrices, but require quadratic number of function evaluations.
We highlight trade-offs when comparing our methods to those based on
variational quantum circuits such as the recently proposed differentiable
quantum circuits (DQC) approach. The proposed methods offer potential quantum
enhancement through the rich kernel representations using the power of quantum
feature maps, and start the quest towards provably trainable quantum DE

that there actually exists a linear transformation.
  In addition, we prove that the core of our algorithm can be performed
locally. Informally, if we start from a coloring where there is a set of

access disparate information about diseases with numerous benefits for

extract knowledge from multimodal datasets in the form of relationships between
disease concepts and normalize both concepts and relationship types.
  Methods: We introduce REMAP, a multimodal approach for disease relation
extraction and classification. The REMAP machine learning approach jointly
embeds a partial, incomplete knowledge graph and a medical language dataset
into a compact latent vector space, followed by aligning the multimodal
embeddings for optimal disease relation extraction.
  Results: We apply REMAP approach to a disease knowledge graph with 96,913

constant, and combats diffusive effects, thereby enabling particle accumulation
and the production and preservation of intense beams. In the case of particle
colliders, cooling increases the likelihood of observing rare physics events.
One of the most important conceptual and technological advances in this area
was stochastic cooling (SC), which was instrumental in the discovery of the W
and Z bosons at CERN and the top quark at Fermilab2-6. SC reduces the random
motion of the beam particles through granular sampling and correction of the
beams phase-space structure, thus bearing resemblance to a Maxwells demon. The
extension of SC from the microwave regime up to optical frequencies and
bandwidths has long been pursued as it could increase the achievable cooling
rates by three to four orders of magnitude and provide a powerful new tool for
future accelerators. First proposed nearly thirty years ago, Optical Stochastic
Cooling (OSC) replaces the conventional microwave elements of SC with
optical-frequency analogs and is, in principle, compatible with any species of
charged-particle beam7,8. Here we describe the first experimental demonstration
of OSC in a proof-of-principle experiment9 at the Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratorys Integrable Optics Test Accelerator10.

technologies like the Internet-of-Things (IoT) to pave the way for futuristic
smart environments, like smart homes, smart transportation, smart energy

intercommunicate without the need for centralized trusted parties. Blockchain
replaces these trusted parties in such trustless environments. It provides
security enforcement, privacy assurance, authentication, and other key features
to IoT ecosystems. Besides IoT-Blockchain integration, other technologies add
more benefits that attract the research community. Software-Defined Networking
(SDN), Fog, Edge, and Cloud Computing technologies, for example, play a key
role in enabling realistic IoT applications. Moreover, the integration of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides smart, dynamic, and autonomous
decision-making capabilities for IoT devices in smart environments. To push the
research further in this domain, we provide in this paper a comprehensive
survey that includes state-of-the-art technological integration, challenges,

building blocks of such smart environments. We also demonstrate how the level
of integration between these technologies has increased over the years, which
brings us closer to the futuristic view of smart environments. We further
discuss the current need to provide general-purpose Blockchain platforms that

operation and planning. Besides valuable information about how to run and
possibly expand a power system, the optimization provides an optimal Locational
Marginal Price per node and time step. This price can be seen as the price of
electricity paid by consumers and purchased by suppliers, while maximizing
social welfare. Naturally, it is a direct result of the optimization problem,
and therefore does not give any information about its internal composition.
This paper shows that by applying Flow Tracing, an algorithm for tracking flows
in complex networks, it is possible to interlink Locational Marginal Prices in
a coherent mathematical way. This does not only lead to important insights into
the price structure, but also provides an intuitive decomposition and
allocation of all system costs. Then individual consumers see how much they
have to pay to individual generators and transmission lines in the power
system. This method, introduced as Price Tracing, outperforms similar
approaches provided by the literature, since the resulting cost allocations are
transparent, plausible, and consistent with the Locational Marginal Prices from
the optimization. The Price Tracing method is applied and discussed on behalf
of a power system model of Germany with a high share of renewable power. The
presented analysis and its implications can help in finding a more efficient

constraints, which are highly challenging to engineer and which lead to
intriguing yet not fully understood features such as confinement of particles.
Here, we simulate confinement dynamics in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT on a
superconducting quantum chip. We synthesize the charge--gauge-field interaction
using only 6 native two-qubit gates, enabling us to reach simulation times of
up to 25 Trotter steps. We observe how tuning a term that couples only to the
electric field confines the charges, a manifestation of the tight bond that the
local gauge constraint generates between both. Moreover, we study a different
mechanism, where a modification of the gauge constraint from a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
to a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry freezes the system dynamics. Our work showcases
the dramatic restriction that the underlying gauge constraint imposes on the
dynamics of an LGT, it illustrates how gauge constraints can be modified and
protected, and it paves the way for studying other models governed by many-body
interactions.

nearly infinite (say $a = \frac{1}{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 0$) in $\Omega

photonic doping, it is the leading-order corrections in $\delta$ that are most
interesting: they explain why photonic doping is only mildly affected by the
presence of losses, and why it is seen even at frequencies where dielectric

Borel probability measures on $B$. In relation to a difficult problem of Aldous
in exchangeability theory, and in connection with arithmetic combinatorics,
Austin raised the question of describing the structure of affine-exchangeable
probability measures on product spaces indexed by the vector space
$\mathbb{F}_2^\omega$, i.e., the measures in
$\mathcal{P}(B^{\mathbb{F}_2^\omega})$ that are invariant under the coordinate
permutations on $B^{\mathbb{F}_2^\omega}$ induced by all affine automorphisms
of $\mathbb{F}_2^{\omega}$. We answer this question by describing the extreme
points of the space of such affine-exchangeable measures. We prove that there
is a single structure underlying every such measure, namely, a random
infinite-dimensional cube (sampled using Haar measure adapted to a specific
filtration) on a group that is a countable power of the 2-adic integers.
Indeed, every extreme affine-exchangeable measure in
$\mathcal{P}(B^{\mathbb{F}_2^\omega})$ is obtained from a
$\mathcal{P}(B)$-valued function on this group, by a vertex-wise composition
with this random cube. The consequences of this result include a description of
the convex set of affine-exchangeable measures in
$\mathcal{P}(B^{\mathbb{F}_2^\omega})$ equipped with the vague topology (when
$B$ is a compact metric space), showing that this convex set is a Bauer
simplex. We also obtain a correspondence between affine-exchangeability and
limits of convergent sequences of (compact-metric-space valued) functions on
vector spaces $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ as $n\to\infty$. Via this correspondence, we
establish the above-mentioned group as a general limit domain valid for any
such sequence.

balls-in-boxes scheme and a weighted branching process. To define it, imagine a
deterministic weighted branching process in which weights of the first
generation individuals are given by the elements of a discrete probability
distribution. For each positive integer $j$, identify the $j$th generation
individuals with the $j$th generation boxes. The collection of balls is one and
the same for all generations, and each ball starts at the root of the weighted
branching process tree and moves along the tree according to the following
rule: transition from a mother box to a daughter box occurs with probability
given by the ratio of the daughter and mother weights.
  Assume that there are $n$ balls and that the discrete probability
distribution responsible for the first generation is Weibull-like. Denote by
$\mathcal{K}_n^{(j)}(l)$ and $\mathcal{K}_n^{*(j)}(l)$ the number of the $j$th
generation boxes which contain at least $l$ balls and exactly $l$ balls,
respectively. We prove functional limit theorems (FLTs) for the matrix-valued
processes $\big(\mathcal{K}_{[{\rm

by Iksanov, Kabluchko and Kotelnikova (2022) for the vector-valued process
$\big(\mathcal{K}_{[{\rm e}^{T+\cdot}]}^{(j)}(1)\big)_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$. While
the rows of each of the limit matrix-valued processes are independent and
identically distributed, the entries within each row are stationary Gaussian
processes with explicitly given covariances and cross-covariances. We provide
an integral representation for each row. The results obtained are new even for
Karlin's occupancy scheme.

mission with spectroscopic temperatures to demonstrate the existence of pileups
at the long-period and short-period edges of the temperature-period
distribution for main-sequence stars with temperatures exceeding $\sim 5500$K.
The long-period pileup is well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number,
with a critical value of $\mathrm{Ro_{crit}} \lesssim 2$. The long-period
pileup was predicted by van Saders et al. (2019) as a consequence of weakened
magnetic braking, in which wind-driven angular momentum losses cease once stars
reach a critical Rossby number. Stars in the long-period pileup are found to
have a wide range of ages ($\sim 2-6$Gyr), meaning that, along the pileup,
rotation period is strongly predictive of a star's surface temperature but
weakly predictive of its age. The short-period pileup, which is also
well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, is not a prediction of the
weakened magnetic braking hypothesis but may instead be related to a phase of
slowed surface spin-down due to core-envelope coupling. The same mechanism was
proposed by Curtis et al. (2020) to explain the overlapping rotation sequences
of low-mass members of differently aged open clusters. The relative dearth of
stars with intermediate rotation periods between the short- and long-period
pileups is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, which
aligns with the period gap initially discovered by McQuillan et al. (2013a) in
M-type stars. These observations provide further support for the hypothesis
that the period gap is due to stellar astrophysics, rather than a non-uniform
star-formation history in the Kepler field.

SR methods can improve overall image and video quality and create new

yield good visual quality. Incorrect detail restoration can cause errors when
detecting and identifying objects both manually and automatically. To analyze
the detail-restoration capabilities of image and video SR models, we developed
a benchmark based on our own video dataset, which contains complex patterns
that SR models generally fail to correctly restore. We assessed 32 recent SR

numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws. We treat the numerical

numerical solvers, our agent acts at each discrete location of a computational

methods by acting on local states, the agent must discern how its actions at a
given spatiotemporal location affect the future evolution of the state. The
manifestation of this non-stationarity is addressed by BPTTS, which allows for
the flow of gradients across both space and time. The learned numerical

great achievement in TAPG, most existing works ignore the human perception of
interaction between agents and the surrounding environment by applying a deep

representation. Therefore, it is beneficial and potentially improve the
performance of TAPG if we can capture these interactions between agents and the

Boundary Network (ABN), which consists of two sub-networks (i) an Agent-Aware
Representation Network to obtain both agent-agent and agents-environment
relationships in the video representation, and (ii) a Boundary Generation
Network to estimate the confidence score of temporal intervals. In the
Agent-Aware Representation Network, the interactions between agents are
expressed through local pathway, which operates at a local level to focus on
the motions of agents whereas the overall perception of the surroundings are
expressed through global pathway, which operates at a global level to perceive
the effects of agents-environment. Comprehensive evaluations on 20-action
THUMOS-14 and 200-action ActivityNet-1.3 datasets with different backbone

a hybrid sampling scheme: it employs the PMU-based coarse-grained sampling to

employs the breakpoint-based fine-grained sampling to collect the memory access
pattern of these instructions. Based on our evaluation, CachePerf only imposes
14% performance overhead and 19% memory overhead (for applications with large

visual representation learning with CNNs has its own flaws, e.g., it is
arguable that the pooling layer in traditional CNNs tends to discard positional

achieved better robustness in representation learning by replacing pooling

high costs. Specifically, we use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a risk
measure that the agents can estimate using bandit feedback in the form of the
cost values of only their selected actions. Since the distributions of the cost
functions depend on the actions of all agents that are generally unobservable,
they are themselves unknown and, therefore, the CVaR values of the costs are
difficult to compute. To address this challenge, we propose a new online
risk-averse learning algorithm that relies on one-point zeroth-order estimation
of the CVaR gradients computed using CVaR values that are estimated by
appropriately sampling the cost functions. We show that this algorithm achieves
sub-linear regret with high probability. We also propose two variants of this
algorithm that improve performance. The first variant relies on a new sampling
strategy that uses samples from the previous iteration to improve the
estimation accuracy of the CVaR values. The second variant employs residual
feedback that uses CVaR values from the previous iteration to reduce the
variance of the CVaR gradient estimates. We theoretically analyze the
convergence properties of these variants and illustrate their performance on an
online market problem that we model as a Cournot game.

calibrates its confidence. Deviations of this idealistic map from the identity
map reveal miscalibration. Such calibration errors can be reduced with many
post-hoc calibration methods which fit some family of calibration maps on a
validation dataset. In contrast, evaluation of calibration with the expected
calibration error (ECE) on the test set does not explicitly involve fitting.
However, as we demonstrate, ECE can still be viewed as if fitting a family of
functions on the test data. This motivates the fit-on-the-test view on
evaluation: first, approximate a calibration map on the test data, and second,
quantify its distance from the identity. Exploiting this view allows us to
unlock missed opportunities: (1) use the plethora of post-hoc calibration
methods for evaluating calibration; (2) tune the number of bins in ECE with
cross-validation. Furthermore, we introduce: (3) benchmarking on pseudo-real
data where the true calibration map can be estimated very precisely; and (4)
novel calibration and evaluation methods using new calibration map families PL

contrastive learning to improve adversarial robustness by considering an
adversarial example as another positive example, and aim to maximize the
similarity between random augmentations of data samples and their adversarial
example, while constantly updating the classification head in order to avoid a
cognitive dissociation between the classification head and the embedding space.
This dissociation is caused by the fact that CL updates the network up to the
embedding space, while freezing the classification head which is used to
generate new positive adversarial examples. We validate our method, Contrastive

outperforms both robust accuracy and clean accuracy over alternative supervised

well the BayesWave algorithm can recover the gravitational-wave signal from
core-collapse supernova models in simulated advanced detector noise, and
optimize its ability to accurately reconstruct the signal waveforms. We find
that BayesWave can confidently reconstruct the signal from a range of supernova
explosion models in Advanced LIGO-Virgo for network signal-to-noise ratios
$\gtrsim 30$, reaching maximum reconstruction accuracies of $\sim 90\%$ at SNR

showing great performance for various downstream tasks including medical image
segmentation and its sibling, volumetric image segmentation. Particularly, a
typical volumetric segmentation network strongly relies on a voxel grid
representation which treats volumetric data as a stack of individual voxel
`slices', which allows learning to segment a voxel grid to be as
straightforward as extending existing image-based segmentation networks to the
3D domain. However, using a voxel grid representation requires a large memory
footprint, expensive test-time and limiting the scalability of the solutions.
In this paper, we propose Point-Unet, a novel method that incorporates the
efficiency of deep learning with 3D point clouds into volumetric segmentation.
Our key idea is to first predict the regions of interest in the volume by
learning an attentional probability map, which is then used for sampling the
volume into a sparse point cloud that is subsequently segmented using a
point-based neural network. We have conducted the experiments on the medical
volumetric segmentation task with both a small-scale dataset Pancreas and
large-scale datasets BraTS18, BraTS19, and BraTS20 challenges. A comprehensive

overcome such limitations by replacing pooling layers with dynamic routing and
convolutional strides, which aims to preserve the part-whole relationships.
Capsule network has shown a great performance in image recognition and natural
language processing, but applications for medical image segmentation,
particularly volumetric image segmentation, has been limited. In this work, we
propose 3D-UCaps, a 3D voxel-based Capsule network for medical volumetric image

network with two pathways: the first pathway is encoded by 3D Capsule blocks,
whereas the second pathway is decoded by 3D CNNs blocks. 3D-UCaps, therefore
inherits the merits from both Capsule network to preserve the spatial

substantially decreases internal uncertainties in WD total ages compared to a
uniform constraint. Averaged over the 38 stars in our sample, the total

via the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it Planck}$+\Lambda$CDM) by
$\sim 5\sigma$. This so-called ""Hubble tension"" has been confirmed by other
independent methods, and thus does not appear to be a possible consequence of
systematic errors. Here, we continue upon our prior work of using Type II
supernovae to provide another, largely-independent method to measure the
Hubble-Lema\^itre constant. From 13 SNe~II with geometric, Cepheid, or tip of
the red giant branch (TRGB) host-galaxy distance measurements, we derive H$_0=
75.4^{+3.8}_{-3.7}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Mpc$^{-1}$ (statistical errors only),
consistent with the local measurement but in disagreement by $\sim 2.0\sigma$
with the {\it Planck}$+\Lambda$CDM value. Using only Cepheids ($N=7$), we find
H$_0 = 77.6^{+5.2}_{-4.8}$\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Mpc$^{-1}$, while using only TRGB

find statistically significant difference between the Cepheid and TRGB H$_0$

is the central challenge to learning. In order for complexity-efficient models
to exist and be discoverable in high dimensions, we require a computational
framework that relates a credible notion of complexity to simple parameter
representations. Further, this framework must allow excess complexity to be
gradually removed via gradient-based optimization. Our n-ary, or n-argument,
activation functions fill this gap by approximating belief functions
(probabilistic Boolean logic) using logit representations of probability. Just
as Boolean logic determines the truth of a consequent claim from relationships
among a set of antecedent propositions, probabilistic formulations generalize
predictions when antecedents, truth tables, and consequents all retain
uncertainty. Our activation functions demonstrate the ability to learn
arbitrary logic, such as the binary exclusive disjunction (p xor q) and ternary
conditioned disjunction ( c ? p : q ), in a single layer using an activation
function of matching or greater arity. Further, we represent belief tables
using a basis that directly associates the number of nonzero parameters to the
effective arity of the belief function, thus capturing a concrete relationship
between logical complexity and efficient parameter representations. This opens
optimization approaches to reduce logical complexity by inducing parameter
sparsity.

this direction have drawn considerable attention from theoretical as well as
observational perspectives. It has been shown that such effects can also be
recovered near the horizon of black holes which might play a crucial role in
understanding the information paradox. With this motivation, we have studied
the gravitational memory effect near the horizon of black holes analogous to
the one obtained at asymptotic null infinity.
  We first study how the AS emerge near the horizon of black holes and how they
can be detected via some ideal detectors as some permanent change of
configurations (Memory) once GW passes through the setup. The emergence of AS
is studied from two different perspectives. First, how AS emerge as soldering
freedoms when two black holes are being glued along a common null surface.
Secondly, in the form of AS that preserve the asymptotic form of the near
horizon metric of a black hole. We have established an analogous form of the
displacement memory near the horizon of non-extreme and extreme black holes for
both these perspectives. We also discuss the detection prospects of the
supertranslation memory or hair. In this direction, other than the memory
effect, we have explored the possibility of detecting a supertranslated black
hole through standard tests of General Relativity. We propose a scenario in
which such a configuration may be distinguished from ordinary black holes by
examining the photon trajectories near the horizon. As we know that the
gravitational memory has not been detected yet, in this direction, our study
might serve as a useful contribution towards investigation of the signatures of
AS in the future.

in a part of the circuit which does not have check logic to detect the

flipping a single bit in a single data value, up to causing the software to
execute the wrong instructions. Silent data corruptions (SDC) in hardware
impact computational integrity for large-scale applications. Manifestations of
silent errors are accelerated by datapath variations, temperature variance, and
age, among other silicon factors. These errors do not leave any record or trace
in system logs. As a result, silent errors stay undetected within workloads,
and their effects can propagate across several services, causing problems to
appear in systems far removed from the original defect. In this paper, we
describe testing strategies to detect silent data corruptions within a large

experimented with different methods for detection and mitigation. We compare

surface as non-ice materials. The chemical compositions of those Cl-bearing
salts are key to understanding Europa's ocean chemistry and habitability. Here
we report the results of ground-based telescope observations of Europa across
two wavelength ranges, 1.0-1.5 and 1.5-1.8 $\mu m$, of which the former range
includes absorption features owing to some hydrated Cl-bearing salts. We
obtained spatially resolved reflectance spectra using the Subaru Telescope/IRCS

$\mu m$) and low noise levels (1$\sigma$ ~ 1-2 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$). We found no
clear absorption features at ~1.2 $\mu$m caused by hydrated Cl-bearing salts.
We estimated that conservative upper limits to the abundances of
MgCl$_2$$\cdot$nH$_2$O, NaClO$_4$$\cdot$2H$_2$O, Mg(ClO$_3$)$_2$$\cdot$6H$_2$O,
and Mg(ClO$_4$)$_2$$\cdot$6H$_2$O on Europa are 17% (<10% for most) at the
3$\sigma$ noise level. These values are lower than the proposed abundance of
some hydrated Cl-bearing salts (> ~20%) on Europa based on previous
observations. This supports the idea that Cl-bearing salts on Europa are likely
anhydrous Na salts of NaCl and/or NaClO$_4$, or hydrated NaCl$\cdot$2H$_2$O.
The presence of Na salts suggests that Na$^+$ could be the major cation in
Europa's ocean, which would be possible if the oceanic pH is circumneutral or

encoding important features about the location, creation and evolution of the

statistically predominant in the observed data once detectors will reach the
required sensitivity. We present a novel implementation of fully analytical GW
templates from eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers within the
\texttt{Wolfram Mathematica} software. We increase the accuracy by identifying
and minimizing the possible source of errors. We start with an overview of the
physics involved in eccentric mergers, then assemble the strain for the
inspiral by employing up to six post-Newtonian (PN) corrections. We complete
the eccentric inspiral with the quasi-circular Backwards one Body (BoB) merger
model in frequency, amplitude and phase, then we build the hybrid GW strain for
the whole evolution of the binary. For low eccentricity we reach coincidence in
the overlap, with no ambiguity in the time interval, a remarkable improvement
from the usual matching techniques. For high-eccentricity we compensate for the
implicit quasi-circular assumption of the BOB approach, by introducing a small
rescaling in amplitude. Our streamlined implementation is relevant for the new
field of GW astronomy and is straightforward to understand, use and extend,
offering researchers in the field a valuable open resource tool.

work, teachable agents often take a passive role in the learning interaction,
and there are few studies in which the agent and student engage in natural

of teaching modality when interacting with a virtual agent, via the web-based
teaching platform, the Curiosity Notebook. A method of teaching the agent by
selecting sentences from source material is compared to a method paraphrasing
the source material and typing text input to teach. A user study has been
conducted to measure the effect teaching modality on the learning outcomes and
engagement of the participants. The results indicate that teaching via
paraphrasing and text input has a positive effect on learning outcomes for the
material covered, and also on aspects of affective engagement. Furthermore,
increased paraphrasing effort, as measured by the similarity between the source
material and the material the teacher conveyed to the robot, improves learning

  via inner disagreement based OOD detector","35 pages, 6 figures","Knowledge based System, 2021",,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize objects from unseen classes, where
the kernel problem is to transfer knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes
by establishing appropriate mappings between visual and semantic features. The
knowledge transfer in many existing works is limited mainly due to the facts
that 1) the widely used visual features are global ones but not totally
consistent with semantic attributes; 2) only one mapping is learned in existing
works, which is not able to effectively model diverse visual-semantic
relations; 3) the bias problem in the generalized ZSL (GZSL) could not be
effectively handled. In this paper, we propose two techniques to alleviate
these limitations. Firstly, we propose a Semantic-diversity transfer Network
(SetNet) addressing the first two limitations, where 1) a multiple-attention
architecture and a diversity regularizer are proposed to learn multiple local
visual features that are more consistent with semantic attributes and 2) a
projector ensemble that geometrically takes diverse local features as inputs is
proposed to model visual-semantic relations from diverse local perspectives.
Secondly, we propose an inner disagreement based domain detection module (ID3M)
for GZSL to alleviate the third limitation, which picks out unseen-class data
before class-level classification. Due to the absence of unseen-class data in
training stage, ID3M employs a novel self-contained training scheme and detects
out unseen-class data based on a designed inner disagreement criterion.
Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SetNet with the explored ID3M achieves a significant improvement against $30$
state-of-the-art methods.

We then use optimality of the proposed $H_\infty$ controller to inspect
feasibility of different ratios of bandwidths of the inner and outer

the missing at random assumption is assumed to handle missingness, which
however is unverifiable empirically. Thus, sensitivity analysis is critically
important to assess the robustness of the study conclusions against untestable

imputation models such as return-to-baseline, control-based, and washout
imputation. Multiple imputation is popular in sensitivity analysis; however, it
may be inefficient and result in an unsatisfying interval estimation by Rubin's
combining rule. We propose distributional imputation (DI) in sensitivity
analysis, which imputes each missing value by samples from its target
imputation model given the observed data. Drawn on the idea of Monte Carlo
integration, the DI estimator solves the mean estimating equations of the
imputed dataset. It is fully efficient with theoretical guarantees. Moreover,
we propose weighted bootstrap to obtain a consistent variance estimator, taking
into account the variabilities due to model parameter estimation and target
parameter estimation. The finite-sample performance of DI inference is assessed
in the simulation study. We apply the proposed framework to an antidepressant
longitudinal clinical trial involving missing data to investigate the
robustness of the treatment effect. Our proposed DI approach detects a
statistically significant treatment effect in both the primary analysis and

box/class prediction networks based on weighted bidirectional feature network.
Second, the paper proposes automatically customized anchor for each level in
the weighted bidirectional feature network. Third, the paper proposes an
efficient training loss function and training strategy to balance and optimize
network. Based on these optimizations, we have developed an end-to-end
perception network to perform multi-tasking, including traffic object
detection, drivable area segmentation and lane detection simultaneously, called
HybridNets, which achieves better accuracy than prior art. In particular,
HybridNets achieves 77.3 mean Average Precision on Berkeley DeepDrive Dataset,
outperforms lane detection with 31.6 mean Intersection Over Union with 12.83
million parameters and 15.6 billion floating-point operations. In addition, it
can perform visual perception tasks in real-time and thus is a practical and
accurate solution to the multi-tasking problem. Code is available at

term by characteristic functions and then design a minimization algorithm based
on a modification of the iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM),
namely ICTM-LVF. This minimization algorithm enjoys the energy-decaying
property under some conditions and has highly efficient performance in the
segmentation. To overcome the initialization issue of active contour models, we
generalize the inhomogeneous graph Laplacian initialization method (IGLIM) to
the multi-phase case and then apply it to give the initial contour of the
ICTM-LVF solver. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic images and
real images to demonstrate the capability of our initialization method, and the
effectiveness of the local variance force for noise robustness in the

characterizing the divertor heat loads. Many experimental, theoretical, and
numerical studies have been performed in recent years. In this paper, a 2D
electrostatic turbulence code, BOUT-HESEL, has been upgraded to simulate H-mode
plasmas for the first time. The code is validated against the previous
implementation and the experiments. The simulated \lambda_q is found to agree
quite well with the Eich scaling for the EAST H-mode discharge. The code is
utilized to simulate the ITER 15MA baseline scenario. The ITER simulation
reveals that the radial particle/heat transports are dominated by blobby
transports, and predicts \lambda_{q,ITER} = 9.6 mm, which is much larger than
the prediction by the Eich scaling. Based on the EAST modified cases, an
estimated HESEL H-mode scaling, \lambda_q=0.51R_c^1.1B_t^(-0.3)q_95^1.1 is
proposed. This scaling predicts \lambda_{q,ITER} = 9.3 mm, which agrees
surprisingly well with that for the ITER case. A further investigation combined
with the basic parameters in the database of the Eich scaling shows that the
missing positive scaling dependence on the machine size (Rc) in the Eich
scaling appears to be shaded by the negative scaling dependence on the toroidal
magnetic field (Bt) for current devices. This is however not the case for ITER,
explaining why simulations in recent studies and in this paper can reproduce
the Eich scaling for current devices, but predict a much larger \lambda_q for
ITER. According to the simulation results, the strong positive scaling
dependence of \lambda_q on Rc is due to a combination of slowing down the
parallel heat transports by increasing the parallel connection length and the
enhancement of the radial ExB turbulent heat transports when the machine size
is increased.

the streaming source inputs, and hence the source sentence is always incomplete
during translating. Different from the full-sentence MT using the conventional
seq-to-seq architecture, SiMT often applies prefix-to-prefix architecture,
which forces each target word to only align with a partial source prefix to
adapt to the incomplete source in streaming inputs. However, the source words
in the front positions are always illusoryly considered more important since
they appear in more prefixes, resulting in position bias, which makes the model
pay more attention on the front source positions in testing. In this paper, we
first analyze the phenomenon of position bias in SiMT, and develop a
Length-Aware Framework to reduce the position bias by bridging the structural
gap between SiMT and full-sentence MT. Specifically, given the streaming
inputs, we first predict the full-sentence length and then fill the future
source position with positional encoding, thereby turning the streaming inputs
into a pseudo full-sentence. The proposed framework can be integrated into most

dwarf star encompasses a reversible stage, where heat can be transferred back
and forth between nuclear and dark matter. Induced nuclear burning phases are
stable and early carbon depletion undermines previous claims of type Ia
supernova ignition. Instead, mini black holes are formed at the center of the
star that either evaporate or accrete stellar material until a macroscopic
sub-Chandrasekhar-mass black hole is formed. In the latter case, a 0.1 to 1
second lasting electromagnetic transient signal can be detected upon ejection
of the white dwarf's potential magnetic field. Binary systems that transmute to
black holes and subsequently merge emit gravitational waves. Advanced
LIGO/Virgo should detect one such sub-Chandrasekhar binary black hole inspiral
per year, while future Einstein telescope-like facilities will detect thousands
per year. The effective spin parameter distribution is peaked at 0.2 and
permits future studies to disentangle from primordial sub-Chandrasekhar black
holes. Such signatures are compatible with current direct detection
constraints, as well as with neutron star constraints in the case of bosonic
dark matter, even though they remain in conflict with the fermionic case for
part of the parameter space.

success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language

costly, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer suffers
from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length. To confront
this, we propose FCA, a fine- and coarse-granularity hybrid self-attention that
reduces the computation cost through progressively shortening the computational
sequence length in self-attention. Specifically, FCA conducts an
attention-based scoring strategy to determine the informativeness of tokens at
each layer. Then, the informative tokens serve as the fine-granularity
computing units in self-attention and the uninformative tokens are replaced
with one or several clusters as the coarse-granularity computing units in
self-attention. Experiments on GLUE and RACE datasets show that BERT with FCA
achieves 2x reduction in FLOPs over original BERT with <1% loss in accuracy. We
show that FCA offers a significantly better trade-off between accuracy and
FLOPs compared to prior methods.

In particular, the special band features of black phosphorus may bring
intriguing physical characteristics. Here, we study theoretically the effect of
band gap tunability of black phosphorus on the MTJs with black phosphorus
barrier. It is found that, the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) may achieve a
transition from finite value to infinity owing to the variation of the band gap
of black phosphorus. Combining with the latest experimental results of the
pressure-induced band gap tunability, we further investigate the pressure
effect of TMR in the MTJs with black phosphorus barrier. The calculations show
that the pressure sensitivity can be quite high under appropriate parameters.
Physically, the high sensitivity originates from the TMR transition phenomenon.
To take advantage of the high pressure sensitivity, we propose and design a
detailed structure of highly sensitive pressure sensors based on MTJs with
black phosphorus barrier, whose working mechanism is basically different from
the convential pressure sensors. The present pressure sensors possess four

transformers that exploit intrinsic image structures through spectral tokens

between foreground content and background noise by spectral tokens pooling. And
the attribute surrogate learning scheme is designed to benefit from the rich

assigned by their labels. Our Hierarchically Cascaded Transformers, called

integrate the learning of alignment into the translation model, a Gaussian
distribution centered on predicted aligned position is introduced as an

experimentally determined neutrino mass splittings. We find that a nonzero
$m_{\nu l}$ introduces a new phase space factor in the loss rate $\Gamma_{\rm

squared mass gap between the parent and daughter neutrinos, i.e., $\Gamma_{\rm

$\tau_0$ is the $\nu_H$ rest-frame lifetime. Using a general form of this

that for a parent neutrino of mass $m_{\nu H} \lesssim 0.1 {\rm eV}$, the new
phase space factor weakens the constraint on its lifetime by up to a factor of
50 if $\Delta m_\nu^2$ corresponds to the atmospheric mass gap and up to
$10^{5}$ if the solar mass gap, in comparison with naive estimates that assume
$m_{\nu l}=0$. The revised constraints are (i) $\tau^0 \gtrsim (6 \to 10)

neutrino decays to a daughter neutrino separated by, respectively, the
atmospheric and the solar mass gap, and (ii) $\tau^0 \gtrsim (2 \to 3) \times
10^7~{\rm s}$ in the case of two decay channels with one near-common
atmospheric mass gap. In contrast to previous, naive limits which scale as
$m_{\nu H}^5$, these mass spectrum-consistent $\tau_0$ constraints are
remarkably independent of the parent mass and open up a swath of parameter
space within the projected reach of IceCube and other neutrino telescopes in

backbone for representation and a linear classifier to output the logit of each
class. A recent study has shown a phenomenon called neural collapse that the
within-class means of features and the classifier vectors converge to the
vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) at the terminal phase of
training on a balanced dataset. Since the ETF geometric structure maximally
separates the pair-wise angles of all classes in the classifier, it is natural
to raise the question, why do we spend an effort to learn a classifier when we
know its optimal geometric structure? In this paper, we study the potential of
learning a neural network for classification with the classifier randomly
initialized as an ETF and fixed during training. Our analytical work based on
the layer-peeled model indicates that the feature learning with a fixed ETF
classifier naturally leads to the neural collapse state even when the dataset
is imbalanced among classes. We further show that in this case the cross
entropy (CE) loss is not necessary and can be replaced by a simple squared loss
that shares the same global optimality but enjoys a better convergence
property. Our experimental results show that our method is able to bring
significant improvements with faster convergence on multiple imbalanced
datasets.

to achieve a uniform distribution. To further retain important shape features,
an adaptive sampling strategy with a novel saliency loss is designed. With our

re-processed from two public datasets (i.e., nirscene and SEN12MS) and our
novel NIR+RGB sweet pepper(capsicum) dataset. We quantitatively and
qualitatively demonstrate that these NIR+RGB datasets are sufficient to be used
for synthetic NIR image generation. We achieved Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 11.36, 26.53, and 40.15 for nirscene1, SEN12MS, and sweet pepper
datasets respectively. In addition, we release manual annotations of 11 fruit
bounding boxes that can be exported as various formats using cloud service.
Four newly added fruits [blueberry, cherry, kiwi, and wheat] compound 11 novel
bounding box datasets on top of our previous work presented in the deepFruits
project [apple, avocado, capsicum, mango, orange, rockmelon, strawberry]. The
total number of bounding box instances of the dataset is 162k and it is ready
to use from cloud service. For the evaluation of the dataset, Yolov5 single
stage detector is exploited and reported impressive
mean-average-precision,mAP[0.5:0.95] results of[min:0.49, max:0.812]. We hope
these datasets are useful and serve as a baseline for the future studies.

formalism that allows one to analytically express the mass and spin parameters
of the Kerr black hole in terms of observational data: the total redshift and
blueshift of photons emitted by geodesic massive particles revolving the black
hole and their orbital parameters. Thus, we present concise closed formulas for
the mass and spin parameters of the Kerr black hole in terms of few directly
observed quantities in the case of equatorial circular orbits either when the
black hole is static or is moving with respect to a distant observer.
Furthermore, we incorporate the gravitational dragging effect generated by the
rotating nature of the Kerr black hole into the analysis and elucidate its
non-trivial contribution to the expression for the light bending parameter and
the frequency shifts of photons emitted by orbiting particles that renders
simple symmetric expressions for the kinematic redshift and blueshift. We also
incorporate the dependency of the frequency shift on the azimuthal angle, a
fact that allows one to express the total redshift/blueshift along any point of
the orbit of the revolving particle for the cases when the black hole is both
static or moving with respect to us. These formulas allow one to compute the
Kerr black hole parameters by applying this general relativistic formalism to
astrophysical systems like the megamaser accretion disks orbiting supermassive
black holes at the core of active galactic nuclei. Our results open a new
window to implement parameter estimation studies to constrain black hole
variables, and they can be generalized to black hole solutions beyond Einstein
gravity.

the support to a whole augmented feature pyramid from the query, facilitating

prediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality
models, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task
learning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are
trained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to
other cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to
predict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data
from multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI
features from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities,
including clinical and demographic information, to predict the future
trajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the
study-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In
addition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is
applied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained
and tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results.
Our results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the

speaker features for many speech applications where speaker information is
needed. Current SOTA backbone networks for speaker embedding are designed to
aggregate multi-scale features from an utterance with multi-branch network
architectures for speaker representation. However, naively adding many branches
of multi-scale features with the simple fully convolutional operation could not
efficiently improve the performance due to the rapid increase of model
parameters and computational complexity. Therefore, in the most current
state-of-the-art network architectures, only a few branches corresponding to a
limited number of temporal scales could be designed for speaker embeddings. To
address this problem, in this paper, we propose an effective temporal
multi-scale (TMS) model where multi-scale branches could be efficiently
designed in a speaker embedding network almost without increasing computational
costs. The new model is based on the conventional TDNN, where the network
architecture is smartly separated into two modeling operators: a
channel-modeling operator and a temporal multi-branch modeling operator. Adding
temporal multi-scale in the temporal multi-branch operator needs only a little
bit increase of the number of parameters, and thus save more computational
budget for adding more branches with large temporal scales. Moreover, in the
inference stage, we further developed a systemic re-parameterization method to
convert the TMS-based model into a single-path-based topology in order to
increase inference speed. We investigated the performance of the new TMS method
for automatic speaker verification (ASV) on in-domain and out-of-domain
conditions. Results show that the TMS-based model obtained a significant
increase in the performance over the SOTA ASV models, meanwhile, had a faster
inference speed.

Also, we show that the problem is \FPT\ with respect to the number $q$ of

show that the problem also admits a kernel with $\Oh(q^3)$ vertices. For the

recognizing graphs with cd-chromatic number at most $q$ is \NP-hard in general

associated with flux cancellation, which occurs between two small-scale
opposite polarities and is driven by shearing and converging motions. The 3D
NLFFF model reveals that the reconnection takes place in a hyperbolic flux tube
that is located above the flux cancellation site and below the FC. The FC is
gradually built up toward a twisted flux rope via series of small-scale
reconnection events that occur intermittently prior to the eruption.

to estimate ion-size impacts on the ionic flow. The analysis is built on the
geometric singular perturbation theory, particularly on specific structures of
this concrete model. For 1:1 ionic mixtures, we first conduct precise
mathematical analysis and derive a matching system of nonlinear algebraic
equations. We then extend the results by directing on a critical case where the
current is zero. Treating the ion sizes as small parameters, we derive an

amount of recent data instead of keeping around an infinite supply of older
(less relevant) data. In addition, we argue that increasing the stock of data
by including older datasets may, in fact, damage the model's accuracy.
Expectedly, the model's accuracy improves by increasing the flow of data
(defined as data collection rate); however, it requires other tradeoffs in
terms of refreshing or retraining machine learning models more frequently.
  Using these results, we investigate how the business value created by machine
learning models scales with data and when the stock of data establishes a
sustainable competitive advantage. We argue that data's time-dependency weakens
the barrier to entry that the stock of data creates. As a result, a competing
firm equipped with a limited (yet sufficient) amount of recent data can develop
more accurate models. This result, coupled with the fact that older datasets
may deteriorate models' accuracy, suggests that created business value doesn't
scale with the stock of available data unless the firm offloads less relevant
data from its data repository. Consequently, a firm's growth policy should
incorporate a balance between the stock of historical data and the flow of new
data.
  We complement our theoretical results with an experiment. In the experiment,
we empirically measure the loss in the accuracy of a next word prediction model
trained on datasets from various time periods. Our empirical measurements
confirm the economic significance of the value decline over time. For example,
100MB of text data, after seven years, becomes as valuable as 50MB of current

advertise their content via lightweight approximate indicators (e.g., Bloom
filters) to efficiently inform clients where each datum is likely cached. While
false-positive indications are necessary and well understood, most existing
works assume no false-negative indications. Our work illustrates practical
scenarios where false-negatives are unavoidable and ignoring them significantly
impacts system performance. Specifically, we focus on false-negatives induced
by indicator staleness, which arises whenever the system advertises the
indicator only periodically, rather than immediately reporting every change in
the cache. Such scenarios naturally occur, e.g., in bandwidth-constraint
environments or when latency impedes each client's ability to obtain an updated
indicator. Our work introduces novel false-negative aware access policies that
continuously estimate the false-negative ratio and sometimes access caches
despite negative indications. We present optimal policies for homogeneous
settings and provide approximation guarantees for our algorithms in
heterogeneous environments. We further perform an extensive simulation study
with multiple real system traces. We show that our false-negative aware
algorithms incur a significantly lower access cost than existing approaches or
match the cost of these approaches while requiring an order of magnitude fewer
resources (e.g., caching capacity or bandwidth).

about privacy leakage. To address the issue, privacy-leaking image detection is
studied recently, with the goal to automatically identify images that may leak
privacy. Recent advance on this task benefits from focusing on crucial objects
via pretrained object detectors and modeling their correlation. However, these
methods have two limitations: 1) they neglect other important elements like
scenes, textures, and objects beyond the capacity of pretrained object
detectors; 2) the correlation among objects is fixed, but a fixed correlation
is not appropriate for all the images. To overcome the limitations, we propose
the Dynamic Region-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (DRAG) that dynamically
finds out crucial regions including objects and other important elements, and
models their correlation adaptively for each input image. To find out crucial
regions, we cluster spatially-correlated feature channels into several
region-aware feature maps. Further, we dynamically model the correlation with
the self-attention mechanism and explore the interaction among the regions with
a graph convolutional network. The DRAG achieved an accuracy of 87% on the
largest dataset for privacy-leaking image detection, which is 10 percentage
points higher than the state of the art. The further case study demonstrates
that it found out crucial regions containing not only objects but other

to other human-centered applications such as face recognition. Existing studies
on fairness in speaker recognition systems are largely limited to evaluating
biases at specific operating points of the systems, which can lead to false

strategies developed for speaker recognition systems. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate the biases present in speaker recognition systems with

proposed methods improve the fairness of ASV systems over baseline methods

improve fairness, they are prone to reduced utility. On the other hand,
multi-task methods can improve the fairness while retaining the utility. These
findings can inform the choice of bias mitigation strategies in the field of

models, and transfer-based targeted attacks have attracted a lot of interest
due to their practical applicability. To maximize the transfer success rate,
adversarial examples should avoid overfitting to the source model, and image
augmentation is one of the primary approaches for this. However, prior works
utilize simple image transformations such as resizing, which limits input
diversity. To tackle this limitation, we propose the object-based diverse input
(ODI) method that draws an adversarial image on a 3D object and induces the
rendered image to be classified as the target class. Our motivation comes from
the humans' superior perception of an image printed on a 3D object. If the
image is clear enough, humans can recognize the image content in a variety of
viewing conditions. Likewise, if an adversarial example looks like the target
class to the model, the model should also classify the rendered image of the 3D
object as the target class. The ODI method effectively diversifies the input by
leveraging an ensemble of multiple source objects and randomizing viewing
conditions. In our experimental results on the ImageNet-Compatible dataset,
this method boosts the average targeted attack success rate from 28.3% to 47.0%
compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the applicability
of the ODI method to adversarial examples on the face verification task and its
superior performance improvement. Our code is available at

fields. Recently, researchers in the acoustic signal processing field noticed
its success and leveraged contrastive learning for better music representation.
Typically, existing approaches maximize the similarity between two distorted
audio segments sampled from the same music. In other words, they ensure a
semantic agreement at the music level. However, those coarse-grained methods
neglect some inessential or noisy elements at the frame level, which may be
detrimental to the model to learn the effective representation of music.
Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel Positive-nEgative frame mask for
Music Representation based on the contrastive learning framework, abbreviated
as PEMR. Concretely, PEMR incorporates a Positive-Negative Mask Generation
module, which leverages transformer blocks to generate frame masks on the
Log-Mel spectrogram. We can generate self-augmented negative and positive
samples by masking important components or inessential components,
respectively. We devise a novel contrastive learning objective to accommodate
both self-augmented positives/negatives sampled from the same music. We conduct
experiments on four public datasets. The experimental results of two
music-related downstream tasks, music classification, and cover song
identification, demonstrate the generalization ability and transferability of
music representation learned by PEMR.

existence of solutions seem to be optimal, up to a logarithmic factor in
$\tau$, when $\tau>>1$: we illustrate this fact by introducing two toy models,
both consisting of systems of two parabolic equations, obtained after a slight
modification of the nonlinearity of the usual Keller-Segel system. For these

fail when ported to new framework releases. Previous studies showed that
applications using relatively old non-APIs are more likely to be compatible
with new releases compared to the ones that used newly introduced non-APIs.
Furthermore, from our previous study about the stability of Eclipse internal
interfaces, we discovered that there exist 327K stable non-API methods as the
Eclipse framework evolves. In the same study, we recommended that 327K stable
non-API methods can be used by Eclipse interface providers as possible
candidates for promotion to stable interfaces. However, since non-APIs are
unsupported and considered to be immature i.e., can contain bugs, to this end
there exist a need to first investigate the stable non-APIs for possible bugs
before they can be promoted to APIs. In this study, we empirically investigated
the stable non-API for possible bugs using Sonarqube software quality tool. We
discovered that over 79.8% classes containing old stable non-APIs methods have
zero bugs. Results from this study can be used by both interface providers and
users as a starting point to analyze which interfaces are well tested and also
estimate how much work could be involved when performing bug fixing for a given

attention but remains extremely challenging due to the drastic appearance
differences across aerial-ground views. In existing methods, global
representations of different views are extracted primarily using Siamese-like

this paper, we present a novel approach using cross-view knowledge generative
techniques in combination with transformers, namely mutual generative
transformer learning (MGTL), for CVGL. Specifically, by taking the initial
representations produced by the backbone network, MGTL develops two separate
generative sub-modules -- one for aerial-aware knowledge generation from
ground-view semantics and vice versa -- and fully exploits the entirely mutual
benefits through the attention mechanism. Moreover, to better capture the
co-visual relationships between aerial and ground views, we introduce a
cascaded attention masking algorithm to further boost accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging public benchmarks, \emph{i.e.}, {CVACT} and {CVUSA},
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method which sets new records
compared with the existing state-of-the-art models.

representation learning on graph structured data. GNNs follow an approach of
message passing analogous to 1-dimensional Weisfeiler Lehman (1-WL) test for
graph isomorphism and consequently are limited by the distinguishing power of
1-WL. More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need
increased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors.
Instead of the WL approach, in this work, we follow the classical approach of
Individualization and Refinement (IR), a technique followed by most practical
isomorphism solvers. Individualization refers to artificially distinguishing a
node in the graph and refinement is the propagation of this information to
other nodes through message passing. We learn to adaptively select nodes to
individualize and to aggregate the resulting graphs after refinement to help
handle the complexity. Our technique lets us learn richer node embeddings while
keeping the computational complexity manageable. Theoretically, we show that
our procedure is more expressive than the 1-WL test. Experiments show that our
method outperforms prominent 1-WL GNN models as well as competitive
higher-order baselines on several benchmark synthetic and real datasets.
Furthermore, our method opens new doors for exploring the paradigm of learning

originality of the devised algorithms stems from combining a Langevin Monte

word labels during testing as the ASR decoding step, which finds the most
likely sequence of words given phoneme posterior probabilities, is omitted. The
model is evaluated via the root-mean-squared error between the predicted and
observed speech reception thresholds from eight normal-hearing listeners. The
recognition task consists of identifying noisy words from a German matrix
sentence test. The speech material was mixed with eight noise maskers covering
different modulation types, from speech-shaped stationary noise to a
single-talker masker. The prediction performance is compared to five
established models and an ASR-model using word labels. Two combinations of
features and networks were tested. Both include temporal information either at
the feature level (amplitude modulation filterbanks and a feed-forward network)
or captured by the architecture (mel-spectrograms and a time-delay deep neural
network, TDNN). The TDNN model is on par with the DNN while reducing the number
of parameters by a factor of 37; this optimization allows parallel streams on
dedicated hearing aid hardware as a forward-pass can be computed within the
10ms of each frame. The proposed model performs almost as well as the
label-based model and produces more accurate predictions than the baseline

method called Act-VH that actively computes where to touch the objects based on
the reconstruction uncertainty. Act-VH reconstructs objects from point clouds
and calculates the reconstruction uncertainty using IGR, a recent
state-of-the-art implicit surface deep neural network. We experimentally
evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of Act-VH against five baselines in

for this purpose. The results show that Act-VH outperforms all baselines and
that an uncertainty-driven haptic exploration policy leads to higher
reconstruction accuracy than a random policy and a policy driven by Gaussian
Process Implicit Surfaces. As a final experiment, we evaluate Act-VH and the
best reconstruction baseline on grasping 10 novel objects. The results show
that Act-VH reaches a significantly higher grasp success rate than the baseline
on all objects. Together, this work opens up the door for using active
visuo-haptic shape completion in more complex cluttered scenes.

deep rest-frame UV spectroscopy from the MUSE HUDF Survey to study the
connection between the strength of the observed UV 2175{\AA} bump and the
Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron photometry, which at the redshift range of our sample
probes mid-IR polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at ~6-8 micron.
The sample has robust spectroscopic redshifts and consists of typical
main-sequence galaxies with a wide range in stellar mass (log(Mstar/Msun) ~
8.5-10.7) and star formation rates (SFRs; SFR ~ 1-100 Msun/yr). Galaxies with
MIPS detections have strong UV bumps, except for those with mass-weighted ages
younger than ~150 Myr. We find that the UV bump amplitude does not change with
SFR at fixed stellar mass but increases with mass at fixed SFR. The UV bump
amplitude and the PAH strength (defined as mid-IR emission normalized by SFR)
are highly correlated and both also correlate strongly with stellar mass. We
interpret these correlations as the result of the mass-metallicity
relationship, such that at low metallicities PAH emission is weak due to a
lower abundance of PAH molecules. The weak or complete absence of the 2175{\AA}
bump feature on top of the underlying smooth attenuation curve at low
mass/metallicities is then expected if the PAH carriers are the main source of
the additional UV absorption.

representation to scene completion neural networks. The proposed UDF is simple,
and efficient as a geometry representation, and can be computed on any point
cloud. In contrast to usual Signed Distance Functions, our UDF does not require
normal computation. To obtain the explicit geometry, we present a method for
extracting a point cloud from discretized UDF values on a sparse grid. We
compare different SDFs and UDFs for the scene completion task on indoor and

completion using the proposed UDF function.

imaging activities, radiation exposure has become a major concern for public
health. Sparse-view CT is a promising approach to reduce the radiation dose by
down-sampling the total number of acquired projections. However, the CT images
reconstructed by this sparse-view imaging approach suffer from severe streaking
artifacts and structural information loss. In this work, an end-to-end
dual-domain attention-based deep network (DDANet) is proposed to solve such an
ill-posed CT image reconstruction problem. The image-domain CT image and the
projection-domain sinogram are put into the two parallel sub-networks of the
DDANet to independently extract the distinct high-level feature maps. In
addition, a specified attention module is introduced to fuse the aforementioned
dual-domain feature maps to allow complementary optimizations of removing the
streaking artifacts and mitigating the loss of structure. Numerical
simulations, anthropomorphic thorax phantom and in vivo pre-clinical
experiments are conducted to verify the sparse-view CT imaging performance of
the DDANet. Results demonstrate that this newly developed approach is able to
robustly remove the streaking artifacts while maintaining the fine structures.
As a result, the DDANet provides a promising solution in achieving high quality
sparse-view CT imaging.

the empirical research on the financial market, many assets, especially
commodities, often show this positive correlation phenomenon in some time
periods, which shows that our model has strong practical application value.

e$^+$e$^-$-collider under development by the CLIC accelerator collaboration,
hosted by CERN. The CLIC accelerator has been optimised for three energy stages
at centre-of-mass energies 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV. CLIC uses a novel
two-beam acceleration technique, with normal-conducting accelerating structures
operating in the range of 70-100 MV/m.
  The report describes recent achievements in accelerator design, technology
development and prototyping, system tests and beam tests. Large-scale
CLIC-specific beam tests have taken place, for example, at the CLIC Test
Facility CTF3 at CERN, at the Accelerator Test Facility ATF2 at KEK, at the
FACET facility at SLAC and at the FERMI facility in Trieste. Together, they
demonstrate that all implications of the CLIC design parameters are well
understood and reproducible in beam tests and prove that the CLIC performance
goals are realistic. The implementation of CLIC near CERN has been
investigated. Focusing on a staged approach starting at 380 GeV, this includes
civil engineering aspects, electrical networks, cooling and ventilation and
installation scheduling, transport. All CLIC studies have put emphasis on
optimising cost and energy efficiency, and the resulting power and cost
estimates are reported. The report follows very closely the accelerator project
description in the CLIC Summary Report for the European Particle Physics
Strategy update 2018-19.
  Detailed studies of the physics potential and detector for CLIC, and R&D on
detector technologies, have been carried out by the CLIC detector and physics
(CLICdp) collaboration. CLIC provides excellent sensitivity to Beyond Standard
Model physics, through direct searches and via a broad set of precision
measurements of Standard Model processes, particularly in the Higgs and
top-quark sectors.

tuned by varying the relative angle (also called twist angle) between its
monolayers. As a remarkable feature, both the electronic flat bands and the
corresponding strong electron localization have been obtained at a specific
""magic"" angle ($\sim 1.1^{\circ}$), leading to the observation of several
strongly correlated electronic phenomena. Such a discovery has hence inspired
the creation of a novel research field called twistronics, i.e., aiming to
explore novel physical properties in vertically stacked 2D structures when
tuning the twist angle between the related layers. In this paper, a
comprehensive and systematic study related to the electronic properties of
twisted multilayer graphene (TMG) is presented based on atomistic calculations.
The dependence of both the global and the local electronic quantities on the

shared characteristics and differences between various TMG systems as well as

the grid voltages within the secure region. Employing droop voltage regulators
on the RES inverters is an efficient and low cost solution to reach this
objective. However, fixing droop parameters or optimizing them only for
overvoltage conditions does not provide the required robustness and optimality
under changing operating conditions. In this paper, a convex optimization
approach is proposed for reconfiguring PV and QV droop regulators during online
operation. The objective is to minimize power curtailment, power losses, and
voltage deviation subject to electrical security constraints. This enables to
optimally operate the grid with high RES penetration under variable conditions
while preserving electrical security constraints (e.g., current and voltage
limits). As a first contribution, a mixed integer linear model of the droop
characteristics is developed. According to this model, a droop regulated
generation unit is represented as a constant power generator in parallel with a
constant impedance load. As a second contribution, a Modified Augmented Relaxed
Optimal Power Flow (MAROPF) formulation is proposed to guarantee that the
electrical security constraints are respected in the presence of constant
impedance loads in the network. Sufficient conditions for the feasibility of
the MAROPF solution are provided. Those conditions can be checked a priori and
are valid for several real distribution networks. Furthermore, an iterative
approach is proposed to derive an approximate solution to the MAROPF that is
close to the global optimal one. The performance of the MAROPF approach and the
accuracy of the proposed model are evaluated on standard 34 bus and 85 bus test

introduces many perceptually unpleasant artifacts along with the generated
details. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train a GAN-based
SISR model which can stably generate perceptually realistic details while
inhibiting visual artifacts. Based on the observation that the local statistics
(e.g., residual variance) of artifact areas are often different from the areas
of perceptually friendly details, we develop a framework to discriminate
between GAN-generated artifacts and realistic details, and consequently
generate an artifact map to regularize and stabilize the model training
process. Our proposed locally discriminative learning (LDL) method is simple
yet effective, which can be easily plugged in off-the-shelf SISR methods and
boost their performance. Experiments demonstrate that LDL outperforms the
state-of-the-art GAN based SISR methods, achieving not only higher
reconstruction accuracy but also superior perceptual quality on both synthetic

derive a novel dispersive wave equation for landslide. The new dispersive wave
for landslide recovers the classical dispersive water waves as a special case.
We show that the frequency dispersion relation for landslide is inherently
different than the classical frequency dispersion for water waves. The wave
frequency with dispersion increases non-linearly as a function of the wave
number. For dispersive landslide, the wave frequency without dispersion appears
to heavily overestimate the dispersive wave frequency for higher wave number.
Due to the dispersion term emerging from the non-hydrostatic contribution for
landslide, the phase velocity becomes a function of the wave number. This gives
rise to the group velocity that is significantly different from the phase
velocity, characterizing the dispersive mass flow. The dispersive phase
velocity and group velocity decrease non-linearly with the wave number. Yet,
the group velocity is substantially lower than the phase velocity. We
analytically derive a dispersion number as the ratio between the phase velocity
and the group velocity, which measures the deviation of the group velocity from
the phase velocity, provides a dynamic scaling between them and summarizes the
overall effect of dispersion in the mass flow. The dispersion number for
landslide increases rapidly with the wave number, which is in contrast to the
dispersion in water waves. With the definition of the effective dispersive
lateral stress, we prove the existence of an anti-restoring force in landslide.
We reveal the fact that due to the anti-restoring force, landslides are more
dispersive than the piano strings. So, the wave dispersion in landslide is
fundamentally different than the wave dispersion in the piano string. Our model
constitutes a foundation for the wave phenomenon in dispersive mass flows.

used for video data, one out of four pixels is measured in each frame.
Effectively, this leads to a non-regular spatio-temporal sub-sampling. Compared
to purely spatial or temporal sub-sampling, this allows for an increased
reconstruction quality, as aliasing artifacts can be reduced. For the fast
reconstruction of such sensor data with a fixed mask, recursive variant of
frequency selective reconstruction (FSR) was proposed. Here, pixels measured in
previous frames are projected into the current frame to support its
reconstruction. In doing so, the motion between the frames is computed using
template matching. Since some of the motion vectors may be erroneous, it is
important to perform a proper consistency checking. In this paper, we propose
faster consistency checking methods as well as a novel recursive FSR that uses
the projected pixels different than in literature and can handle dynamic masks.
Altogether, we are able to significantly increase the reconstruction quality by
+ 1.01 dB compared to the state-of-the-art recursive reconstruction method
using a fixed mask. Compared to a single frame reconstruction, an average gain
of about + 1.52 dB is achieved for dynamic masks. At the same time, the
computational complexity of the consistency checks is reduced by a factor of 13

abnormal non-monotonic increase of CDW gap in magnitude as a function of

  Segmentation in X-Ray Images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In several image acquisition and processing steps of X-ray radiography,
knowledge of the existence of metal implants and their exact position is highly
beneficial (e.g. dose regulation, image contrast adjustment). Another
application which would benefit from an accurate metal segmentation is cone
beam computed tomography (CBCT) which is based on 2D X-ray projections. Due to
the high attenuation of metals, severe artifacts occur in the 3D X-ray
acquisitions. The metal segmentation in CBCT projections usually serves as a
prerequisite for metal artifact avoidance and reduction algorithms. Since the
generation of high quality clinical training is a constant challenge, this
study proposes to generate simulated X-ray images based on CT data sets
combined with self-designed computer aided design (CAD) implants and make use
of convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT) for metal
segmentation. Model test is performed on accurately labeled X-ray test datasets
obtained from specimen scans. The CNN encoder-based network like U-Net has
limited performance on cadaver test data with an average dice score below 0.30,
while the metal segmentation transformer with dual decoder (MST-DD) shows high
robustness and generalization on the segmentation task, with an average dice
score of 0.90. Our study indicates that the CAD model-based data generation has
high flexibility and could be a way to overcome the problem of shortage in
clinical data sampling and labelling. Furthermore, the MST-DD approach
generates a more reliable neural network in case of training on simulated data.

for video restoration. The temporal features usually contain various noisy and

representations to help video restoration. We are inspired by that the neural
codec is a natural denoiser. In neural codec, the noisy and uncorrelated
contents which are hard to predict but cost lots of bits are more inclined to
be discarded for bitrate saving. Therefore, we design a neural compression
module to filter the noise and keep the most useful information in features for
video restoration. To achieve robustness to noise, our compression module
adopts a spatial channel-wise quantization mechanism to adaptively determine
the quantization step size for each position in the latent. Experiments show
that our method can significantly boost the performance on video denoising,
where we obtain 0.13 dB improvement over BasicVSR++ with only 0.23x FLOPs.
Meanwhile, our method also obtains SOTA results on video deraining and

complex submodels depend on (e.g., physical or geometrical) parameters.
Understanding how outputs of interest are affected by parameter variations thus
plays a key role to gain useful insights on the problem's physics; however,
expensive repeated solutions of the problem using high-fidelity, full-order
models are often unaffordable. In this paper, we propose a parametric reduced
order modeling (ROM) technique for parametrized one-way coupled problems made
by a first independent model, the master model, and a second model, the slave
model, that depends on the master model through Dirichlet interface conditions.
We combine a reduced basis (RB) method, applied to each subproblems, with the
discretized empirical interpolation method (DEIM) to efficiently interpolate or
project Dirichlet data across conforming and non-conforming meshes at the
domains interface, building a low-dimensional representation of the overall
coupled problem. The proposed technique is then numerically verified by
considering a series of test cases involving both steady and unsteady problems,
and deriving a-posteriori error estimates on the solution of the coupled
problem in both cases. This work arises from the need to solve staggered
cardiac electrophysiological models and represents the first step towards the
setting of ROM techniques for the more general two-way Dirichlet-Neumann
coupled problems solved with domain decomposition sub-structuring methods, when
interface non-conformity is involved.

algorithms, Bayesian optimization techniques, etc. come with several parameters
that steer their behavior during the optimization process. To obtain
high-performing algorithm instances, automated algorithm configuration
techniques have been developed. One of the most popular tools is irace, which
evaluates configurations in sequential races, making use of iterated
statistical tests to discard poorly performing configurations. At the end of
the race, a set of elite configurations are selected from those survivor
configurations that were not discarded, using greedy truncation selection. We
study two alternative selection methods: one keeps the best survivor and
selects the remaining configurations uniformly at random from the set of
survivors, while the other applies entropy to maximize the diversity of the
elites. These methods are tested for tuning ant colony optimization algorithms
for traveling salesperson problems and the quadratic assignment problem and
tuning an exact tree search solver for satisfiability problems. The
experimental results show improvement on the tested benchmarks compared to the
default selection of irace. In addition, the obtained results indicate that
non-elitist can obtain diverse algorithm configurations, which encourages us to
explore a wider range of solutions to understand the behavior of algorithms.

propose an autonomous quantum error correction scheme for a rotational
symmetric bosonic code in a four-photon Kerr parametric oscillator. Our scheme
is the simplest possible error correction scheme that can surpass the
break-even point -- it requires only a single continuous microwave tone. We
also introduce an unconditional reset scheme that requires one more continuous
microwave tone in addition to that for the error correction. The key properties
underlying this simplicity are protected quasienergy states of a four-photon
Kerr parametric oscillator and the degeneracy in its quasienergy level
structure. These properties eliminate the need for state-by-state correction in
the Fock basis. Our schemes greatly reduce the complexity of autonomous quantum
error correction and thus may accelerate the use of the bosonic code for
practical quantum computation.

high-fidelity single-shot qubit readout to perform error correction and read
out qubit registers at the end of a computation. However, as devices scale to
larger qubit numbers integrating readout sensors into densely packed qubit
chips is a critical challenge. Two promising approaches are minimising the
footprint of the sensors, and extending the range of each sensor to read more
qubits. Here we show high-fidelity single-shot electron spin readout using a
nanoscale single-lead quantum dot (SLQD) sensor that is both compact and
capable of reading multiple qubits. Our gate-based SLQD sensor is deployed in
an all-epitaxial silicon donor spin qubit device, and we demonstrate
single-shot readout of three $^{31}$P donor quantum dot electron spins with a
maximum fidelity of 95%. Importantly in our device the quantum dot confinement
potentials are provided inherently by the donors, removing the need for
additional metallic confinement gates and resulting in strong capacitive
interactions between sensor and donor quantum dots. We observe a $1/d^{1.4}$
scaling of the capacitive coupling between sensor and $^{31}$P dots (where $d$
is the sensor-dot distance), compared to $1/d^{2.5-3.0}$ in gate-defined
quantum dot devices. Due to the small qubit size and strong capacitive
interactions in all-epitaxial donor devices, we estimate a single sensor can
achieve single-shot readout of approximately 15 qubits in a linear array,
compared to 3-4 qubits for a similar sensor in a gate-defined quantum dot
device. Our results highlight the potential for spin qubit devices with
significantly reduced sensor densities.

privacy constraint. Data heterogeneity is one of the main challenges in FL,
which results in slow convergence and degraded performance. Most existing
approaches only tackle the heterogeneity challenge by restricting the local
model update in client, ignoring the performance drop caused by direct global
model aggregation. Instead, we propose a data-free knowledge distillation
method to fine-tune the global model in the server (FedFTG), which relieves the
issue of direct model aggregation. Concretely, FedFTG explores the input space
of local models through a generator, and uses it to transfer the knowledge from
local models to the global model. Besides, we propose a hard sample mining
scheme to achieve effective knowledge distillation throughout the training. In
addition, we develop customized label sampling and class-level ensemble to
derive maximum utilization of knowledge, which implicitly mitigates the
distribution discrepancy across clients. Extensive experiments show that our
FedFTG significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) FL algorithms and
can serve as a strong plugin for enhancing FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, and

behaviour in many diverse situations through data efficient, generalisable and

representations is important for enabling this, however there is little
agreement as to what a good representation should look like. In this review
article we are going to argue that symmetry transformations are a fundamental
principle that can guide our search for what makes a good representation. The
idea that there exist transformations (symmetries) that affect some aspects of
the system but not others, and their relationship to conserved quantities has
become central in modern physics, resulting in a more unified theoretical
framework and even ability to predict the existence of new particles. Recently,
symmetries have started to gain prominence in machine learning too, resulting
in more data efficient and generalisable algorithms that can mimic some of the
complex behaviours produced by biological intelligence. Finally, first
demonstrations of the importance of symmetry transformations for representation
learning in the brain are starting to arise in neuroscience. Taken together,
the overwhelming positive effect that symmetries bring to these disciplines
suggest that they may be an important general framework that determines the
structure of the universe, constrains the nature of natural tasks and
consequently shapes both biological and artificial intelligence.

our algorithms are very simple and do not require solving such an optimization

and massive galaxies. Mapping SMGs in galaxy protoclusters provides key
insights into where and how these extreme starbursts take place in connections
with the assembly of the large-scale structure in the early Universe. We search
for SMGs at 850$\,\mu m$ using JCMT/SCUBA-2 in two massive protoclusters at
$z=2.24$, BOSS1244 and BOSS1542, and detect 43 and 54 sources with
$S_{850}>4\,$mJy at the $4\sigma$ level within an effective area of
264$\,$arcmin$^2$, respectively. We construct the intrinsic number counts and
find that the abundance of SMGs is $2.0\pm0.3$ and $2.1\pm0.2$ times that of
the general fields, confirming that BOSS1244 and BOSS1542 contain a higher
fraction of dusty galaxies with strongly enhanced star formation. The volume
densities of the SMGs are estimated to be $\sim15-$30 times the average,
significantly higher than the overdensity factor ($\sim 6$) traced by H$\alpha$
emission-line galaxies (HAEs). More importantly, we discover a prominent offset
between the spatial distributions of the two populations in these two
protoclusters -- SMGs are mostly located around the high-density regions of
HAEs, and few are seen inside these regions. This finding may have revealed for
the first time the occurrence of violent star formation enhancement in the
outskirts of the HAE density peaks, likely driven by the boosting of gas
supplies and/or starburst triggering events. Meanwhile, the lack of SMGs inside
the most overdense regions at $z\sim2$ implies a transition to the environment
disfavouring extreme starbursts.

believed to be a manifestation of pressure maxima commonly associated with an
ongoing planet formation and several other physical processes. Hydrodynamic
disc simulations further suggest that multiple dust ring-like structures may be
ubiquitous in discs. In the recent past, it has been shown that dust rings may
provide a suitable avenue for planet formation. We study how a globally
perturbed disc affects dust evolution and core growth by pebble accretion. We
performed global disc simulations featuring a Gaussian pressure profile, in
tandem with global perturbations of the gas density, mimicking wave-like
structures, and simulated planetary core formation at pressure minima and
maxima. With Gaussian pressure profiles, grains in the inside disc regions were
extremely depleted in the first 0.1 Myrs of disc lifetime. The global pressure
bumps confined dust material for several million years, depending on the
strength of perturbations. A variety of cores formed in bumpy discs, with
massive cores at locations where core growth was not feasible in a smooth disc,
and small cores at locations where massive cores could form in a smooth disc.
We conclude that pressure bumps generated by a planet and/or other physical
phenomena can completely thwart planet formation from the inside parts of the
disc. While inner disc parts are most favourable for pebble accretion in a
smooth disc, multiple wave-like pressure bumps can promote rapid planet
formation by pebble accretion in broad areas of the disc.

  battery","5 figures",,,,"hep-ex physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLB) have been regarded as the most
promising candidate to achieve the next generation energy storage with high
energy and high safety. However, some bottlenecks, including high interfacial
resistance, bad electrochemical stability, and low conductivity, have hindered
its further development. Here, we developed a Pyr13FSI/LiFSI-based gel
electrolyte and used it in the LFP/LTO full battery system to achieve a
lithium-ion battery with high safety and cycle stability. The presence of ionic
liquid in the electrolyte reduces the crystallinity of PVDF-HFP polymer matrix,
increases the ion conductivity of the electrolyte, and greatly improves the
electrode-electrolyte interface contact. These advantages enable the battery to
work at room temperature and reach a specific capacity of 123mAh/g at the
current of 1C. The slightly change in interfacial resistances between the gel
electrolyte and electrodes with the increase of the cycle numbers is confirmed
through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The high electrochemical
stability of the electrolyte in the LFP/LTO system makes the battery exhibit
good cycle stability, and the battery maintains 80% of its initial capacity
after 2000 cycles at the current of 1C. In addition, benefitting from the
excellent properties of ionic liquids, such as non-flammability, negligible
vapour pressure, and high conductivity, the obtained gel electrolyte based
LFP/LTO pouch battery exhibits high safety and cycle stability.

beneficial for medical applications, where there is an abundance of data but
labeling is costly and time consuming. We propose an unsupervised contrastive
learning framework that is motivated from the perspective of label smoothing.
The proposed approach uses a novel contrastive loss that naturally exploits a
data augmentation scheme in which new samples are generated by mixing two data
samples with a mixing component. The task in the proposed framework is to
predict the mixing component, which is utilized as soft targets in the loss

weather removal methods have achieved significant performance improvements on
many benchmark datasets. However, these methods require large amounts of
clean-weather degraded image pairs for training, which is often difficult to
obtain in practice. Although various weather degradation synthesis methods
exist in the literature, the use of synthetically generated weather degraded
images often results in sub-optimal performance on the real weather degraded
images due to the domain gap between synthetic and real-world images. To deal
with this problem, various semi-supervised restoration (SSR) methods have been
proposed for deraining or dehazing which learn to restore the clean image using
synthetically generated datasets while generalizing better using unlabeled
real-world images. The performance of a semi-supervised method is essentially
based on the quality of the unlabeled data. In particular, if the unlabeled
data characteristics are very different from that of the labeled data, then the
performance of a semi-supervised method degrades significantly. We
theoretically study the effect of unlabeled data on the performance of an SSR
method and develop a technique that rejects the unlabeled images that degrade
the performance. Extensive experiments and ablation study show that the
proposed sample rejection method increases the performance of existing SSR
deraining and dehazing methods significantly. Code is available at

Models (HMMs) trained on neuroimaging time series data have since arisen as a
method to produce dynamical models that are easy to train but can be difficult

determining important communities of brain regions using a spatiotemporal
random walk-based procedure that takes advantage of the underlying Markov

new results that corroborate the modular processing hypothesis of the brain at

backdoor is inserted into the neural network by poisoning the training dataset,
misclassifying inputs that contain the adversary trigger. The major challenge
for defending against these attacks is that only the attacker knows the secret
trigger and the target class. The problem is further exacerbated by the recent
introduction of ""Hidden Triggers"", where the triggers are carefully fused into
the input, bypassing detection by human inspection and causing backdoor
identification through anomaly detection to fail. To defend against such
imperceptible attacks, in this work we systematically analyze how
representations, i.e., the set of neuron activations for a given DNN when using
the training data as inputs, are affected by backdoor attacks. We propose
PiDAn, an algorithm based on coherence optimization purifying the poisoned
data. Our analysis shows that representations of poisoned data and authentic
data in the target class are still embedded in different linear subspaces,
which implies that they show different coherence with some latent spaces. Based
on this observation, the proposed PiDAn algorithm learns a sample-wise weight
vector to maximize the projected coherence of weighted samples, where we
demonstrate that the learned weight vector has a natural ""grouping effect"" and
is distinguishable between authentic data and poisoned data. This enables the
systematic detection and mitigation of backdoor attacks. Based on our
theoretical analysis and experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness
of PiDAn in defending against backdoor attacks that use different settings of

  Transformer",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nowadays, our mobility systems are evolving into the era of intelligent
vehicles that aim to improve road safety. Due to their vulnerability,
pedestrians are the users who will benefit the most from these developments.
However, predicting their trajectory is one of the most challenging concerns.
Indeed, accurate prediction requires a good understanding of multi-agent
interactions that can be complex. Learning the underlying spatial and temporal
patterns caused by these interactions is even more of a competitive and open
problem that many researchers are tackling. In this paper, we introduce a model
called PRediction Transformer (PReTR) that extracts features from the
multi-agent scenes by employing a factorized spatio-temporal attention module.
It shows less computational needs than previously studied models with
empirically better results. Besides, previous works in motion prediction suffer
from the exposure bias problem caused by generating future sequences
conditioned on model prediction samples rather than ground-truth samples. In
order to go beyond the proposed solutions, we leverage encoder-decoder
Transformer networks for parallel decoding a set of learned object queries.
This non-autoregressive solution avoids the need for iterative conditioning and
arguably decreases training and testing computational time. We evaluate our
model on the ETH/UCY datasets, a publicly available benchmark for pedestrian
trajectory prediction. Finally, we justify our usage of the parallel decoding
technique by showing that the trajectory prediction task can be better solved
as a non-autoregressive task.

full-color image from the raw data. Recently, joint denoising and demosaicking
(JDD) for burst images, namely JDD-B, has attracted much attention by using
multiple raw images captured in a short time to reconstruct a single
high-quality image. One key challenge of JDD-B lies in the robust alignment of
image frames. State-of-the-art alignment methods in feature domain cannot
effectively utilize the temporal information of burst images, where large
shifts commonly exist due to camera and object motion. In addition, the higher
resolution (e.g., 4K) of modern imaging devices results in larger displacement
between frames. To address these challenges, we design a differentiable
two-stage alignment scheme sequentially in patch and pixel level for effective
JDD-B. The input burst images are firstly aligned in the patch level by using a
differentiable progressive block matching method, which can estimate the offset
between distant frames with small computational cost. Then we perform implicit
pixel-wise alignment in full-resolution feature domain to refine the alignment
results. The two stages are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the significant improvement of our method over existing
JDD-B methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/GuoShi28/2StageAlign.

effective potential energy that determines the spinning motion of an
ellipsoidal planet around its axis is considered. By studying the rotational
potential energy of an ellipsoidal planet orbiting a spherical star on an
elliptic orbit with fixed eccentricity and semi-major axis, it is shown that
the system presents an infinite number of metastable equilibrium
configurations. These states correspond to local minima of the rotational
potential energy averaged over an orbit, where the ratio between the rotational
period of the planet around its axis and the revolution period around the star
is fixed. The configurations in which this ratio is an integer or an half
integer are of particular interest. Among these configurations, the deepest
minimum in the average potential energy corresponds to a situation where the
rotational and orbital motion of the planet are synchronous, and the system is
tidally locked. The next-to-the deepest minimum corresponds to the case in
which the planet rotates three times around its axis in the time that it needs
to complete two orbits around the Sun. The latter is indeed the case that
describes Mercury's motion. The method discussed in this work allows one to
identify the integer and half-integer ratios that correspond to spin-orbit
resonances and to describe the motion of the planet in the resonant orbit.

workshops bring together researchers from different communities who are
developing formal models of real systems in areas where complex models occur,
such as networks, cyber-physical systems, hardware/software co-design, biology,
etc. The motivation and aim for MARS stem from the following two observations:
  * Large case studies are essential to show that specification formalisms and
modelling techniques are applicable to real systems, whereas many research
papers only consider toy examples or tiny case studies.
  * Developing an accurate model of a real system takes a large amount of time,
often months or years. In most scientific papers, however, salient details of
the model need to be skipped due to lack of space, and to leave room for formal
verification methodologies and results.
  The MARS workshops aim at remedying these issues, emphasising modelling over
verification, so as to retain lessons learnt from formal modelling, which are
not usually discussed elsewhere.

the adapted model to produce spatially consistent samples with respect to the

three techniques for defining them from known ones.
  The minimum degrees of polynomials in an ascending basis can increase such as
with bases of Bernstein and Zernike Radial polynomials. They have applications
in computer-aided design and optics.
  We give coefficient functions for mappings from the monomials to descending
bases of Bernstein polynomials, and ascending ones of Zernike Radial
polynomials and prove their correctness.
  Allowing for parity, we define eight general change of basis matrices and the
related equations for composing their coefficient functions.
  A main example is the change of basis from shifted Legendre polynomials to
Bernstein polynomials considered by R Farouki [7]. The analysis enables us to
find a more general hypergeometric function for the coefficient function, and
recurrences for finding coefficient functions by matrix row and column. We show
the column coefficient functions are equivalent to the Lagrange interpolation
polynomials of their elements. We also provide a solution to an open problem
[7] by showing there is no general closed form expression for the coefficient
function from Gosper's Algorithm.
  Truncation, alternation and superposition increase the scope further.
Alternation enables, for example, a change of basis between Bernstein and
Zernike Radial polynomials. A summary shows that the groupoid of change of
basis matrices is a small category, and triangular and alternating change of
basis matrices are morphisms in full subcategories of it. Truncation is a

  Strong-Lens Galaxy","15 pages, 13 figures. Accepted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac776",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Exploiting the relative proximity of the nearby strong-lens galaxy SNL-1, we
present a critical comparison of the mass estimates derived from independent
modelling techniques. We fit triaxial orbit-superposition dynamical models to
spatially-resolved stellar kinematics, and compare to the constraints derived
from lens modelling of high-resolution photometry. From the dynamical model, we
measure the total (dynamical) mass enclosed within a projected aperture of
radius the Einstein radius to be $\log_{10} M_{\mathrm{Ein.}} = 11.00 \pm
0.02$, which agrees with previous measurements from lens modelling to within
$5\%$. We then explore the intrinsic (de-projected) properties of the
best-fitting dynamical model. We find that SNL-1 has approximately-constant,
intermediate triaxiality at all radii. It is oblate-like in the inner regions
(around the Einstein radius) and tends towards spherical at larger radii. The
stellar velocity ellipsoid gradually transforms from isotropic in the very
central regions to radially-biased in the outskirts. We find that SNL-1 is
dynamically consistent with the broader galaxy population, as measured by the
relative fraction of orbit `temperatures' compared to the CALIFA survey. On the
mass--size plane, SNL-1 occupies the most-compact edge given its mass, compared
to both the MaNGA and SAMI surveys. Finally, we explore how the observed
lensing configuration is affected by the orientation of the lens galaxy. We
discuss the implications of such detailed models on future combined lensing and
dynamical analyses.

adopts complex tortuous configurations that are reminiscent of the energy
barriers encountered during crack propagation. As such, the study of crack
front deformations is key to rationalize the effective failure properties of
micro-structured solids and interfaces. Yet, the impact of a localized
dissipation in a finite region behind the crack front, called the process zone,
has often been overlooked. In this work, we derive the equation ruling 3D
coplanar crack propagation in heterogeneous cohesive materials where the
opening of the crack is resisted by some traction in its wake. We show that the
presence of a process zone results in two competing effects on the deformation
of crack fronts: (i) it makes the front more compliant to small-wavelength
perturbations, and (ii) it smooths out local fluctuations of strength and
process zone size, from which emerge heterogeneities of fracture energy. Their
respective influence on front deformations is shown to strongly impact the
stability of perturbed crack fronts, as well as their stationary shapes when
interacting with arrays of tough obstacles. Overall, our theory provides a
unified framework to predict the variety of front profiles observed in
experiments, even when the small-scale yielding hypothesis of linear elastic
fracture mechanics breaks down.

significant diversity gain even in the smallest spaces. Motivated by the
groundbreaking potentials of liquid antennas, researchers in the wireless
communication community are investigating a novel antenna system where a single
antenna can freely switch positions along a small linear space to pick the
strongest received signal. However, the FAS positions do not necessarily follow
the ever-existing rule separating them by at least half the radiation
wavelength. Previous work in the literature parameterized the channels of the
FAS ports simply enough to provide a single-integral expression of the
probability of outage and various insights on the achievable performance.
Nevertheless, this channel model may not accurately capture the correlation
between the ports, given by Jake's model. This work builds on the
state-of-the-art and accurately approximates the FAS channel while maintaining
analytical tractability. The approximation is performed in two stages. The
first stage approximation considerably reduces the number of multi-fold
integrals in the probability of outage expression, while the second stage
approximation provides a single integral representation of the FAS probability
of outage. Further, the performance of such innovative technology is
investigated under a less-idealized correlation model. Numerical results
validate our approximations of the FAS channel model and demonstrate a limited
performance gain under realistic assumptions. Further, our work opens the door
for future research to investigate scenarios in which the FAS provides a
performance gain compared to the current multiple antennas solutions.

screening effect of Sb$^{\rm out}$-$p$ orbitals. As the role of this previously
unnoticed orbital state can be tuned or controlled by out-of-plane lattice
parameters, we examine the electronic structure and particularly the evolution
of Van Hove singularity points as a function of strain and pressure, which can
serve as useful knobs to control the material properties.

effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. To apply these methods with
large-scale data sets, a major challenge is to find valid instruments from a
possibly large candidate set. In practice, most of the candidate instruments
are often not relevant for studying a particular exposure of interest.
Moreover, not all relevant candidate instruments are valid as they may directly
influence the outcome of interest. In this article, we propose a data-driven
method for causal inference with many candidate instruments that addresses
these two challenges simultaneously. A key component of our proposal is a novel
resampling method, which constructs pseudo variables to remove irrelevant
candidate instruments having spurious correlations with the exposure. Synthetic
data analyses show that the proposed method performs favourably compared to
existing methods. We apply our method to a Mendelian randomization study

Notably, the samples annealed in air (GMO-air) exhibit a saturation

fundamental problem underlying various visual generation tasks. Predominant
approaches measure the inter-image distance by computing pointwise absolute
deviations, which tends to estimate the median of instance distributions and
leads to blurs and artifacts in the generated images. This paper presents
MoNCE, a versatile metric that introduces image contrast to learn a calibrated
metric for the perception of multifaceted inter-image distances. Unlike vanilla
contrast which indiscriminately pushes negative samples from the anchor
regardless of their similarity, we propose to re-weight the pushing force of
negative samples adaptively according to their similarity to the anchor, which
facilitates the contrastive learning from informative negative samples. Since
multiple patch-level contrastive objectives are involved in image distance
measurement, we introduce optimal transport in MoNCE to modulate the pushing
force of negative samples collaboratively across multiple contrastive
objectives. Extensive experiments over multiple image translation tasks show
that the proposed MoNCE outperforms various prevailing metrics substantially.

sensing under low-cost data annotation, has attracted increased attention.
However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic variance for
the inconsistency of annotated points. Existing POL methods heavily reply on
accurate key-point annotations which are difficult to define. In this study, we
propose a POL method using coarse point annotations, relaxing the supervision
signals from accurate key points to freely spotted points. To this end, we
propose a coarse point refinement (CPR) approach, which to our best knowledge
is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from the perspective of
algorithm. CPR constructs point bags, selects semantic-correlated points, and
produces semantic center points through multiple instance learning (MIL). In
this way, CPR defines a weakly supervised evolution procedure, which ensures
training high-performance object localizer under coarse point supervision.
Experimental results on COCO, DOTA and our proposed SeaPerson dataset validate
the effectiveness of the CPR approach. The dataset and code will be available

coordinates that is regular even on the horizon itself. The whole procedure is
validated with three different examples chosen to illustrate the great
versatility of the method. First, the single rotating black holes are recovered
up to very high values of the Kerr parameter. Second, non-rotating black holes
coupled to a real scalar field, in the presence of a negative cosmological
constant (the so-called MTZ black holes), are obtained. Last, black holes with
complex scalar hairs are computed. Eventually, prospects for future work, in

known about the extent to which RE generation is affected by the stochastic
field intrinsic to disrupting plasmas. RE generation can be modelled with
reduced kinetic models and there has been recent progress in involving losses
due to field stochasticity, either via a loss-time parameter or radial
transport coefficients which can be estimated by tracing test electrons in 3D
fields. We evaluate these terms in ITER using a recent JOREK 3D MHD simulation
of plasma disruption to provide the stochastic magnetic fields where RE markers
are traced with the built-in particle tracing module. While the MHD simulation
modelled only the current quench phase, the case is MHD unstable and exhibits
similar relaxation as would be expected during the thermal quench. Therefore,
the RE simulations can be considered beginning right after the thermal quench
but before the MHD relaxation is complete. The plasma is found to become fully
stochastic for 8 ms and the resulting transport is sufficient to overcome RE
avalanche before flux surfaces are reformed. We also study transport mechanisms
for trapped REs and find those to be deconfined as well during this phase.
While the results presented here are not sufficient to assess the magnitude of
the formed RE beam, we show that significant RE losses could be expected to
arise due to field stochasticity.

  theoretical physics",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  One of the most important and commonly used operations in many linear algebra
functions is matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM), which is also a key component
in obtaining high performance of many scientific codes. It is a computationally
intensive function requiring $O(n^3)$ operations, and its high computational
intensity makes it well-suited to be significantly accelerated with GPUs.
Today, many research problems require solving a very large number of relatively
small GEMM operations that cannot utilise the entire GPU. To overcome this
bottleneck, special functions have been developed that pack several GEMM
operations into one and then compute them simultaneously on a GPU, which is
called a batch operation. In this research work, we have proposed a different
approach based on linking multiple GEMM operations to MPI ranks and then
binding multiple MPI ranks to a single GPU. To increase GPU utilisation, more
MPI ranks (i.e. GEMM operations) are added. We implement and test this approach
in the field of theoretical physics to compute entanglement properties through
simulated annealing Monte Carlo simulation of quantum spin chains. For the
specific use case, we were able to simulate a much larger spin system and
achieve a speed-up of up to $35\times$ compared to the parallel CPU-only
version.

sequencing 1051 samples, corresponding to 556 distinct individuals enrolled in
a weight loss intervention (8-week low-calorie diet (LCD) at 800 kcal/day)
followed with a 6-month ad libitum randomized DI. Transcriptome profiles
obtained with QuantSeq sequencing were benchmarked against Illumina RNAseq.
Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to
further confirm associations. Cell specificity was assessed using freshly
isolated cells and THP-1 cell line. Results During LCD, 5 modules were found,
of which 3 included at least 1 bioclinical variable. Change in body mass index
(BMI) connected with changes in mRNA level of genes with inflammatory response
signature. In this module, change in BMI was negatively associated with changes
in expression of genes encoding secreted protein (GDF15, CCL3, and SPP1).
Through all phases of the DI, change in GDF15 was connected to changes in SPP1,
CCL3, LIPA and CD68. Further characterization showed that these genes were
specific to macrophages (with LIPA, CD68 and GDF15 expressed in
anti-inflammatory macrophages) and GDF15 also expressed in preadipocytes.
Conclusion Network analyses identified a novel AT feature with GDF15
upregulated with calorie restriction induced weight loss, concomitantly to
macrophage markers. In AT, GDF15 was expressed in preadipocytes and macrophages
where it was a hallmark of anti-inflammatory cells.

composition principle, which asserts that hidden states must ascribe values to
observables in a way that is consistent with all functional relations between
them. This principle is motivated by the assumption that, like functions of
observables in classical mechanics, a function $g(A)$ of an observable A in
quantum theory is simply a logically possible observable derived from $A$, and
that measuring $g(A)$ consists in measuring $A$ and post-processing the
resulting value via $g$. In this paper we show that, under suitable conditions,
this reasonable assumption is in conflict with the collapse postulate. We then
discuss possible solutions to this conflict, and we argue that the most
justifiable and less radical one consists in adapting the collapse postulate by
taking measurement contexts into account. This dependence on contexts arises
for precisely the same reason why noncontextual hidden-variable models are
ruled out by the Kochen-Specker theorem, namely that an observable A can
typically be written as a function $A=g(B)=h(C)$ of noncommuting observables
$B,C$.

functional representation of a random vector $Y$ is presented, which only
relies on a finite set of samples with unknown distribution. Motivated by
recent advances with computational optimal transport for estimating Wasserstein
distances, we develop a new \textit{Wasserstein multi-element polynomial chaos
expansion} (WPCE). It relies on the minimization of a regularized empirical
Wasserstein metric known as debiased Sinkhorn divergence.
  As a requirement for an efficient polynomial basis expansion, a suitable
(minimal) stochastic coordinate system $X$ has to be determined with the aim to
identify ideally independent random variables. This approach generalizes
representations through diffeomorphic transport maps to the case of
non-continuous and non-injective model classes $\mathcal{M}$ with different
input and output dimension, yielding the relation $Y=\mathcal{M}(X)$ in
distribution. Moreover, since the used PCE grows exponentially in the number of
random coordinates of $X$, we introduce an appropriate low-rank format given as
stacks of tensor trains, which alleviates the curse of dimensionality, leading
to only linear dependence on the input dimension. By the choice of the model
class $\mathcal{M}$ and the smooth loss function, higher order optimization
schemes become possible. It is shown that the relaxation to a discontinuous
model class is necessary to explain multimodal distributions. Moreover, the
proposed framework is applied to a numerical upscaling task, considering a
computationally challenging microscopic random non-periodic composite material.
This leads to tractable effective macroscopic random field in adopted

found experimentally and numerically in various continuum models. However,
there is currently no mathematical theory for the emergence of these localised
cellular patterns from a quiescent state. A key issue is that standard
techniques for one-dimensional patterns have proven insufficient for
understanding localisation in higher dimensions. In this work, we present a
comprehensive approach to this problem by using techniques developed in the
study of axisymmetric patterns. Our analysis covers localised patterns equipped
with a wide range of dihedral symmetries, avoiding a restriction to solutions
on a predetermined lattice. The context in this paper is a theory for the
emergence of such patterns near a Turing instability for a general class of
planar reaction-diffusion equations. Posing the reaction-diffusion system in
polar coordinates, we carry out a finite-mode Fourier decomposition in the
angular variable to yield a large system of coupled radial ordinary
differential equations. We then utilise various radial spatial dynamics
methods, such as invariant manifolds, rescaling charts, and normal form
analysis, leading to an algebraic matching condition for localised patterns to
exist in the finite-mode reduction. This algebraic matching condition is
nontrivial, which we solve via a combination of by-hand calculations and
Gr\""obner bases from polynomial algebra to reveal the existence of a plethora
of localised dihedral patterns. These results capture the essence of the
emergent localised hexagonal patterns witnessed in experiments. Moreover, we
combine computer-assisted analysis and a Newton-Kantorovich procedure to prove
the existence of localised patches with 6m-fold symmetry for arbitrarily large
Fourier decompositions. This includes the localised hexagon patches that have
been elusive to analytical treatment.

Network Operators (MNOs) to build isolated logical networks (slices) on top of
shared infrastructure networks managed by Infrastructure Providers (InP).
Network slicing requires the assignment of infrastructure network resources to
virtual network components at slice activation time and the adjustment of
resources for slices under operation. Performing these operations just-in-time,
on a best-effort basis, comes with no guarantee on the availability of enough
infrastructure resources to meet slice requirements.
  This paper proposes a prioritized admission control mechanism for concurrent
slices based on an infrastructure resource reservation approach. The
reservation accounts for the dynamic nature of slice requests while being
robust to uncertainties in slice resource demands. Adopting the perspective of
an InP, reservation schemes are proposed that maximize the number of slices for
which infrastructure resources can be granted while minimizing the costs
charged to the MNOs. This requires the solution of a max-min optimization
problem with a non-linear cost function and non-linear constraints induced by
the robustness to uncertainties of demands and the limitation of the impact of
reservation on background services. The cost and the constraints are linearized
and several reduced-complexity strategies are proposed to solve the slice
admission control and resource reservation problem. Simulations show that the
proportion of admitted slices of different priority levels can be adjusted by a
differentiated selection of the delay between the reception and the processing
instants of a slice resource request.

  Pre-Training","Under review",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The technical advances in Computed Tomography (CT) allow to obtain immense
amounts of 3D data. For such datasets it is very costly and time-consuming to
obtain the accurate 3D segmentation markup to train neural networks. The
annotation is typically done for a limited number of 2D slices, followed by an
interpolation. In this work, we propose a pre-training method SortingLoss. It
performs pre-training on slices instead of volumes, so that a model could be
fine-tuned on a sparse set of slices, without the interpolation step. Unlike
general methods (e.g. SimCLR or Barlow Twins), the task specific methods (e.g.
Transferable Visual Words) trade broad applicability for quality benefits by
imposing stronger assumptions on the input data. We propose a relatively mild
assumption -- if we take several slices along some axis of a volume, structure
of the sample presented on those slices, should give a strong clue to
reconstruct the correct order of those slices along the axis. Many biomedical
datasets fulfill this requirement due to the specific anatomy of a sample and
pre-defined alignment of the imaging setup. We examine the proposed method on
two datasets: medical CT of lungs affected by COVID-19 disease, and
high-resolution synchrotron-based full-body CT of model organisms (Medaka
fish). We show that the proposed method performs on par with SimCLR, while
working 2x faster and requiring 1.5x less memory. In addition, we present the
benefits in terms of practical scenarios, especially the applicability to the
pre-training of large models and the ability to localize samples within volumes
in an unsupervised setup.

the study of ultrafast pulse propagation along a monolayer, as in the case of
graphene-comprising nanophotonic integrated waveguides. This graphene `hot
electron' model (GHEM) builds upon earlier work, based on the Fermi-Dirac
framework for 2D semiconductors, which was aimed mainly at steady-state
absorptive response of a monolayer under free-space laser-beam illumination.
Our extension adapts the GHEM to in-plane light-matter interaction along
graphene monolayers under intense ps-pulse excitation that leads to the
carrier-density saturation regime. We first provide a quantitative overview of
the `classic' perturbative third-order nonlinear response and then study the
static and transient response of graphene as a function of the GHEM parameters,
with focus on the monolayer quality and voltage-tunability. These results are
compared to phenomenological models for saturable absorption and nonlinear
refraction, showing good agreement with recent experimental works. In
conclusion, the GHEM unifies the experimentally observed absorptive and
refractive optical nonlinearities in a single multi-parametric framework
therefore enabling the evaluation of the voltage-tunable light-matter
interaction in structures such as diffraction-limited nanophotonic waveguides.
This formalism can be readily employed to THz frequencies, adapted to
multi-channel (e.g. pump-probe) nonlinear effects, or developed to include
carrier and lattice-temperature diffusion to extend its validity threshold.

functions are not the only means of linking data and quantities of interest.
Loss functions provide an alternative link, where the quantity of interest is

risk, or expected loss. In this case, one can obtain what is commonly referred
to as a Gibbs posterior distribution by using the empirical risk function

asymptotic concentration properties, and the frequentist calibration of its

Gibbs posteriors create new opportunities for probabilistic inference in modern

associated with high-velocity molecular knots, also detected in SO, surrounded
by a collimated layer of entrained gas. The gas layer appears to accelerate
along the main axis over a length scale delta_0 ~700 au, while its diameter
gradually increases up to several 1000au at 2000au from the protostar. The jet
is fragmented into 18 knots of mass ~10^-3 Msun, unevenly distributed between
the northern and southern lobes, with velocity variations up to 15 km/s close
to the protostar, well below the jet terminal velocities. The knot interval
distribution is approximately bimodal with a scale of ~50-80yr close to the
protostar and ~150-200yr at larger distances >12"". The mass-loss rates derived
from knot masses are overall steady, with values of 2.7x10^-5 Msun/yr

ambient protostellar material with high-velocity knots drives the formation of
a molecular layer around the jet, which accounts for the higher mass-loss rate

neural networks. Most existing DA techniques naively add a certain number of
augmented samples without considering the quality and the added computational
cost of these samples. To tackle this problem, a common strategy, adopted by
several state-of-the-art DA methods, is to adaptively generate or re-weight
augmented samples with respect to the task objective during training. However,
these adaptive DA methods: (1) are computationally expensive and not
sample-efficient, and (2) are designed merely for a specific setting. In this
work, we present a universal DA technique, called Glitter, to overcome both
issues. Glitter can be plugged into any DA method, making training
sample-efficient without sacrificing performance. From a pre-generated pool of
augmented samples, Glitter adaptively selects a subset of worst-case samples
with maximal loss, analogous to adversarial DA. Without altering the training
strategy, the task objective can be optimized on the selected subset. Our
thorough experiments on the GLUE benchmark, SQuAD, and HellaSwag in three
widely used training setups including consistency training, self-distillation
and knowledge distillation reveal that Glitter is substantially faster to train
and achieves a competitive performance, compared to strong baselines.

  Methods. We calculated all the components of the forces contributing to the
evolution of the numerically modelled consecutive coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
obtained with the 2.5D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) module of the code
MPI-AMRVAC. We analysed the thermal and magnetic pressure gradients and the
magnetic tension dictating the formation of several flux ropes in different
locations in the aftermath of the eruptions. These three components were
tracked in the equatorial plane during the propagation of the CMEs to Earth.
Their interaction with other CMEs and with the background solar wind was also
studied.
  Results. We explain the formation of the stealth ejecta and the plasma blobs
(or plasmoids) occurring in the aftermath of solar eruptions. We also address
the faster eruption of a CME in one case with a different background wind, even
when the same triggering boundary motions were applied, and attribute this to
the slightly different magnetic configuration and the large neighbouring
arcade. The thermal pressure gradient revealed a shock in front of these slow
eruptions, formed during their propagation to 1 AU. The double-peaked magnetic
pressure gradient indicates that the triggering method affects the structure of
the CMEs and that a part of the adjacent streamer is ejected along with the
CME.

from $\Lambda$CDM in that CDM is replaced by scalar field dark matter (SFDM) by
calculating the evolution of the background Universe, as well as linear
perturbations, focusing on scalar modes. We consider models with complex scalar
field with a repulsive, quartic self-interaction (SI), and models without SI,
referred to as fuzzy dark matter (FDM). To this end, we modify the Boltzmann
code CLASS, to incorporate the physics of complex SFDM which has as one of its
characteristics that its equation of state is maximally stiff in the very early
Universe, dominating then over all the other cosmic components, even over
radiation. We calculate CMB and matter power spectra as well as unconditional
Press-Schechter halo mass functions for various models, expanding previous
literature that were limited either to the background, or to a semi-analytical
approach to SFDM density perturbations neglecting the early stiff phase.
Comparing our results of each, SFDM and FDM, with real-field ultralight axion
models (ULAs) without SI, we characterize the differences between the
respective background evolution and linear structure growth. Our calculations
confirm previous results of recent literature, implying that SFDM models with
$\gtrsim$ kpc-size halo cores are disfavored, questioning their ability to
explain the small-scale problems on dwarf-galactic scales. Also we find that
the kinetic energy due to the phase of the complex field leads to marked
differences between SFDM/FDM versus ULAs. The mild falloff in the SFDM power
spectrum toward high k is similar to that of CDM but based on different
effects, namely the rapidly shrinking Jeans mass for SFDM as opposed to the
Meszaros effect for CDM. In addition, we find that the sharp cutoff in the ULA
power spectrum is also followed by a mild falloff, albeit at very small power.

linear ordering. Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, despite their success
in downstream NLP applications, often fail to generalize in a
hierarchy-sensitive manner when performing syntactic transformations - for
example, transforming declarative sentences into questions. However, syntactic
evaluations of seq2seq models have only observed models that were not
pre-trained on natural language data before being trained to perform syntactic
transformations, in spite of the fact that pre-training has been found to
induce hierarchical linguistic generalizations in language models; in other
words, the syntactic capabilities of seq2seq models may have been greatly
understated. We address this gap using the pre-trained seq2seq models T5 and
BART, as well as their multilingual variants mT5 and mBART. We evaluate whether
they generalize hierarchically on two transformations in two languages:
question formation and passivization in English and German. We find that
pre-trained seq2seq models generalize hierarchically when performing syntactic
transformations, whereas models trained from scratch on syntactic
transformations do not. This result presents evidence for the learnability of
hierarchical syntactic information from non-annotated natural language text
while also demonstrating that seq2seq models are capable of syntactic
generalization, though only after exposure to much more language data than
human learners receive.

single-trace operators of moderate length are completed by higher-trace
admixtures so as to yield large $N$ tree level eigenstates.
  We are particularly interested in parity pairs with three excitations. Since
parity is respected in the mixing, the odd single-trace operators at low length
cannot receive too many admixtures. We reproduce the tree-level norms of a set
of large $N$ eigenstates up to order $1/N^4$ by integrability methods. This
involves evaluating two-point functions on the sphere, the torus, and the
double-torus. A perfect match is found as long as descendents are absent from
the mixing.
  Using twist to make the descendents appear in the integrability picture
immediately leads to the question how to modify the entangled states occurring
in the hexagon tessellations. We take a closer look at the double-trace
admixtures to the parity even three-excitation operator at length seven, which
are both products of a primary state and a descendent. Their two-point
functions are sensitive to the twist introduced into the Bethe equations. For
transverse scalar excitations we succeed in recovering the corresponding field

stars and so automated analysis methods are becoming an ever increasing
necessity to make as much use of these data as possible. Here we aim to
construct an algorithm that can automatically determine if a given time series
of photometric measurements shows evidence of solar-like oscillations. The
algorithm is aimed at analyzing data from the TESS mission and the future PLATO
mission, and in particular stars in the main-sequence and subgiant evolutionary
stages. The algorithm first tests the range of observable frequencies in the
power spectrum of a TESS light curve for an excess that is consistent with that
expected from solar-like oscillations. In addition, the algorithm tests if a
repeating pattern of oscillation frequencies is present in the time series, and
whether it is consistent with the large separation seen in solar-like
oscillators. Both methods use scaling relations and observations which were
established and obtained during the CoRoT, Kepler, and K2 missions. Using a set
of test data consisting of visually confirmed solar-like oscillators and
nonoscillators observed by TESS, we find that the proposed algorithm can attain
a $94.7\%$ true positive rate and a $8.2\%$ false positive rate at peak
accuracy. However, by applying stricter selection criteria, the false positive
rate can be reduced to $\approx2\%$, while retaining an $80\%$ true positive
rate.

  Thresholds-Part I: Stationary Signals",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One-bit quantization, which relies on comparing the signals of interest with
given threshold levels, has attracted considerable attention in signal
processing for communications and sensing. A useful tool for covariance
recovery in such settings is the arcsine law, that estimates the normalized
covariance matrix of zero-mean stationary input signals. This relation,
however, only considers a zero sampling threshold, which can cause a remarkable
information loss. In this paper, the idea of the arcsine law is extended to the
case where one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) apply time-varying
thresholds. Specifically, three distinct approaches are proposed, investigated,
and compared, to recover the autocorrelation sequence of the stationary signals
of interest. Additionally, we will study a modification of the Bussgang law, a
famous relation facilitating the recovery of the cross-correlation between the
one-bit sampled data and the zero-mean stationary input signal. Similar to the
case of the arcsine law, the Bussgang law only considers a zero sampling
threshold. This relation is also extended to accommodate the more general case
of time-varying thresholds for the stationary input signals.

relative to the background sky of stars were considered planets. During the
Copernican revolution, this definition was altered to objects orbiting around
the Sun, removing the Sun and Moon but adding the Earth to the list of known
planets. The concept of planet is thus not simply a question of nature, origin,
composition, mass or size, but historically a concept related to the motion of
one body around the other, in a hierarchical configuration.
  After discussion within the IAU Commission F2 ""Exoplanets and the Solar
System"", the criterion of the star-planet mass ratio has been introduced in the
definition of the term ""exoplanet"", thereby requiring the hierarchical
structure seen in our Solar System for an object to be referred to as an
exoplanet. Additionally, the planetary mass objects orbiting brown dwarfs,
provided they follow the mass ratio criterion, are now considered as
exoplanets. Therefore, the current working definition of an exoplanet, as
amended in August 2018 by IAU Commission F2 ""Exoplanets and the Solar System"",
reads as follows:
  - Objects with true masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion
of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 Jupiter masses for objects of solar
metallicity) that orbit stars, brown dwarfs or stellar remnants and that have a
mass ratio with the central object below the $L_4$/$L_5$ instability ($M/M_{\rm
central}$$<$$2/(25+\sqrt{621}$)$\approx$1/25) are ""planets"", no matter how they
formed.
  - The minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a
planet should be the same as that used in our Solar System, which is a mass
sufficient both for self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces and for clearing
the neighborhood around the object's orbit.
  Here we discuss the history and the rationale behind this definition.

that the accretion disk, soft X-ray excess, and the X-ray power-law components
were extremely variable. Additionally, the X-ray power-law flux was correlated
with both the soft excess plus disk and the pure disk fluxes. Our finding shows
that at high flux levels the soft X-ray excess and the disk emission both
provided the seed photons for thermal Comptonization in the hot corona, whereas
at low flux levels where the soft excess was absent, the pure disk emission
alone provided the seed photons. The X-ray power-law photon-index was only
weakly variable ($\Delta{\Gamma_{hot}}\leq0.06$) and it was not well correlated
with the X-ray flux over the declining timescale. On the other hand, we found
that the electron temperature of the corona increased from $\sim22$ to
$\sim200$ keV with decreasing number of seed photons from June 2018 to August
2019. At the same time, the optical depth of the corona decreased from
$\tau_{hot}\sim4$ to $\sim0.7$, and the scattering fraction increased from

corona such that it grew in size and became hotter with decreasing accretion
rate during the declining phase. The AGN is most likely evolving with
decreasing accretion rate towards a state similar to the low/hard state of

literature. The substance producing the absorption must have some mass; thus
the question is how large it is. We develop a dynamical model of the Milky Way
system, assuming that it can be represented by a flattened ellipsoid of
rotation. We use the spatial distribution of $\delta$-Cephei and Algol type
variable stars, and mean velocities of stars according to Campbell to calculate
the dynamical density of the Milky Way near the Sun, $0.100\,M_\odot/pc^3$. We
find that the dynamical density is equal to the mean density of stars in the
vicinity of the Sun. Our conclusion is that the intrinsic gravity of stars
fully explains their motion, and the existence of any other matter in any
significant quantity seems unlikely. Therefore, the existence of noticeable
selective absorption seems to be absolutely improbable, unless one admits the
existence in the space of particles much smaller than atoms of elements known
to us. Normal absorption may exist if the particle diameter is of the order of
a millimetre or less, and their mass is comparatively small. This absorption
has not yet been reliably detected; the fact that the number of stars increases
with stellar magnitude more slowly than theory requires in case of uniform
distribution of stars in space, can be equally explained by both light
absorption and decrease in number of stars with distance.

widely used in a variety of civil and military concerns. Because the sensor has
limited battery capacity, energy efficiency is a critical issue with WSNs. As a
result, developing a routing protocol that decreases energy consumption in
sensor nodes to extend the lifetime of the WSN using an intelligence algorithm
has become difficult. LEACH is the first hierarchical routing protocol that
divides the WSN into clusters to reduce energy usage. However, it has reached
its limit in selecting a suitable cluster head and the sensor nodes to be
joined, as well as their quantity. Thus, this research proposes an algorithm
called Wireless Energy Balancing algorithm (WEB) that works on energy balancing
distribution by identifying a suitable cluster head with minimum distance and
high energy. Then it uses the knapsack-problem as a novel algorithm to design
the cluster members. The simulation results demonstrate that the WEB algorithm
outperforms LEACH by 31% in terms of energy conservation and WSN lifetime
extension.

Extended Profile - Local Binary Patterns (EP-LBP), a Canny edge detector, and
the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm with Image File

achieved. Secondly, by using the Active Shape Model (ASM) into Active
Appearance Model (AAM) to follow the hand and infusion the hand geometry
characteristics for verification and identification, hand geometry recognition
is achieved. Thirdly, the encrypted biometric passport information that is
publicly accessible is encoded into the QR code and inserted into the
electronic passport to improve protection. Further, Personal information and
biometric data are encrypted by applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
and the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) 256 algorithm. It will enhance the
biometric passport security system.

  Thresholds-Part II: Non-Stationary Signals","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.09460",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The recovery of the input signal covariance values from its one-bit sampled
counterpart has been deemed a challenging task in the literature. To deal with
its difficulties, some assumptions are typically made to find a relation
between the input covariance matrix and the autocorrelation values of the
one-bit sampled data. This includes the arcsine law and the modified arcsine
law that were discussed in Part I of this work [2]. We showed that by
facilitating the deployment of time-varying thresholds, the modified arcsine
law has a promising performance in covariance recovery. However, the modified
arcsine law also assumes input signals are stationary, which is typically a
simplifying assumption for real-world applications. In fact, in many signal
processing applications, the input signals are readily known to be
non-stationary with a non-Toeplitz covariance matrix. In this paper, we propose
an approach to extending the arcsine law to the case where one-bit ADCs apply
time-varying thresholds while dealing with input signals that originate from a
non-stationary process. In particular, the recovery methods are shown to
accurately recover the time-varying variance and autocorrelation values.
Furthermore, we extend the formulation of the Bussgang law to the case where
non-stationary input signals are considered.

exhibit complex behaviors. In the presence of a shear, swimming bacteria
experience a drift perpendicular to the shear plane. This drift, termed
rheotaxis, is studied here semi-analytically, numerically and experimentally.
We find the dependency of bacterial orientation and bacterial speed on the
shear rate, in the presence of rotational diffusion. This enables us to show
that the drift speed of bacteria perpendicular to the shear is predominantly
due to bacterial propulsion, and not rheotactic forces. Comparing the drift
speed of bacteria and diffusion leads to the definition of a P\'{e}clet number.
The rheotactic effect increases with the shear, reaching a plateau at very
large P\'{e}clet numbers, in good agreement with experiments of rheotaxis
performed in microfluidic droplets.

connectivity has become one of the most pervasive paradigms for neuroimaging
analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) motivated from geometric deep
learning have attracted broad interest due to their established power for
modeling complex networked data. Despite their superior performance in many
fields, there has not yet been a systematic study of how to design effective
GNNs for brain network analysis. To bridge this gap, we present BrainGB, a
benchmark for brain network analysis with GNNs. BrainGB standardizes the
process by (1) summarizing brain network construction pipelines for both
functional and structural neuroimaging modalities and (2) modularizing the
implementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets
across cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for
effective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible
research on GNN-based brain network analysis, we host the BrainGB website at
https://braingb.us with models, tutorials, examples, as well as an out-of-box
Python package. We hope that this work will provide useful empirical evidence
and offer insights for future research in this novel and promising direction.

considered to be spatio-temporally graded. It is outlined how this can be
described using the formalism of fuzzy sets theory, with the degree of
causality varying between 1, that is no separation between causes and effects,
and 0, that is perfect separation between causes and their effects as in
classical 'billiard balls' models of physical systems. The model posits that
subjective moments of time are like fuzzy sets, with their extension determined
by local degrees of causality, resulting from information integration processes
extended gradually in space and time. This, we argue, is a way in which a
notion of causality could be, to a certain degree, spared and reconciled with a
variant of Bergsonian duration theory as formulated in the theory of continuous
change as the dimension of consciousness.
