network representation for use in scientometric analysis. We describe the
formation of FoS networks, which relate research topics according to the
authors who publish in them, from corpora of articles in which fields of study
can be identified. FoS networks are particularly useful for the distant reading
of large datasets of research papers when analysed through the lens of
exploring multidisciplinary science. In an evolving scientific landscape,
modular communities in FoS networks offer an alternative categorisation
strategy for research topics and sub-disciplines, when compared to traditional
prescribed discipline classification schemes. Furthermore, structural role
analysis of FoS networks can highlight important characteristics of topics in
such communities. To support this, we present two case studies which explore
multidisciplinary research in corpora of varying size and scope; namely, 6,323

it remains subject to various potential biases. First, residual confounding may
remain due to unobserved HSB, occupation as healthcare worker, or previous

conditioning the analysis on tested samples, which further induces confounding

conventional concept of Fermi surfaces as closed contours in momentum space.
Fermi arcs were first discovered in cuprates, and caused by the pseudogap. Weyl
semimetals provided another way to generate Fermi arcs by breaking either the
time reversal symmetry (TRS) or inversion symmetry of a 3D Dirac semimetal,
which can result in a Weyl semimetal with pairs of Weyl nodes that have
opposite chirality. The bulk-boundary correspondence associated with the Chern
number leads to the emergence of Fermi arcs on the boundary. Here, we present
experimental evidence that pairs of magnetically split hole- and electron-like
Fermi arcs emerge below the Neel temperature, in the antiferromagnetic (AFM)
state of cubic NdBi due to a novel band splitting effect. Whereas TRS is broken
by the AFM order, both inversion and nonsymmorphic TRS are preserved in the
bulk, precluding the possibility of a Weyl semimetal. The observed magnetic
splitting is highly unusual, as it creates bands of opposing curvature, that
changes with temperature and follows the antiferromagnetic order parameter.
This is completely different from previously reported cases of magnetic
splittings such as traditional Zeeman and Rashba, where the curvature of the
bands is preserved. Therefore, our finding represents a new Fermionic state
created by new type of magnetic band splitting in the presence of a long-range
AFM order that are not readily explained by existing theoretical ideas.

using observations obtained via a single incomplete measurement operator, as
there is no information about the signal model in the nullspace of the

reconstructed signals, but to reconstruct the signals we need to know the
model. Two ways to overcome this limitation are using multiple measurement
operators or assuming that the signal model is invariant to a certain group
action. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient sensing conditions
for learning the signal model from measurement data alone which only depend on
the dimension of the model and the number of operators or properties of the
group action that the model is invariant to. As our results are agnostic of the

serves conventional geometric tasks such as surface consolidation and
reconstruction, but also facilitates cutting-edge learning-based techniques for
shape analysis and generation. In this paper, we propose a normal refinement
network, called Refine-Net, to predict accurate normals for noisy point clouds.
Traditional normal estimation wisdom heavily depends on priors such as surface
shapes or noise distributions, while learning-based solutions settle for single
types of hand-crafted features. Differently, our network is designed to refine
the initial normal of each point by extracting additional information from
multiple feature representations. To this end, several feature modules are
developed and incorporated into Refine-Net by a novel connection module.
Besides the overall network architecture of Refine-Net, we propose a new
multi-scale fitting patch selection scheme for the initial normal estimation,
by absorbing geometry domain knowledge. Also, Refine-Net is a generic normal
estimation framework: 1) point normals obtained from other methods can be
further refined, and 2) any feature module related to the surface geometric
structures can be potentially integrated into the framework. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate the clear superiority of Refine-Net over
the state-of-the-arts on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets. Our code is

several constraints concerning eligibility and availability of ovens, release
dates of jobs, setup times between batches as well as oven capacities. Running
the ovens is highly energy-intensive and thus the main objective, besides
finishing jobs on time, is to minimize the cumulative batch processing time

processing problems which typically minimize objectives related to makespan,
tardiness or lateness.

Typically, discrete domains with a spread of misorientation angles are formed,
limiting the applicability of vdW epitaxy. Here we report the epitaxial growth
of monocrystalline, covalent Cr5Te8 2D crystals on monolayer vdW WSe2 by
chemical vapor deposition, driven by interfacial dative bond formation. The
lattice of Cr5Te8, with a lateral dimension of a few ten microns, is fully
commensurate with that of WSe2 via 3 x 3 (Cr5Te8)-7 x 7 (WSe2) supercell

established a conceptually distinct paradigm of thin film epitaxy termed dative

for fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while circumventing its
stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements;
conversely, it ensures the full flexibility of vdW epitaxy, while avoiding its

elements. CoMeFa RAMs can be used to compute in any precision, which is
extremely important for evolving applications like Deep Learning. Adding CoMeFa
RAMs to FPGAs significantly increases their compute density. We explore and
propose two architectures of these RAMs: CoMeFa-D (optimized for delay) and
CoMeFa-A (optimized for area). Compared to existing proposals, CoMeFa RAMs do
not require changing the underlying SRAM technology like simultaneously
activating multiple rows on the same port, and are practical to implement.
CoMeFa RAMs are versatile blocks that find applications in numerous diverse
parallel applications like Deep Learning, signal processing, databases, etc. By
augmenting an Intel Arria-10-like FPGA with CoMeFa-D (CoMeFa-A) RAMs at the
cost of 3.8% (1.2%) area, and with algorithmic improvements and efficient
mapping, we observe a geomean speedup of 2.5x (1.8x), across several
representative benchmarks. Replacing all or some BRAMs with CoMeFa RAMs in
FPGAs can make them better accelerators of modern compute-intensive workloads.

technological and industrial applications and arise from a network of
particle-particle contacts that dynamically adapts to imposed shear. Reported
herein are studies aimed at explor-ing how dynamic covalent chemistry between
particles and the polymeric solvent can be used to tailor such stress-adaptive
contact networks leading to their unusual rheological behaviors. Specifically,
a room temperature dynamic thia-Michael bond is employed to rationally tune the
equilibrium constant (Keq) of the polymeric solvent to the particle interface.
It is demonstrated that low Keq leads to shear thinning while high Keq produces
antithixotropy, a rare phenomenon where the viscosity increases with shearing
time. It is proposed that an increase in Keq increases the polymer graft
density at the particle surface and that antithixotropy primar-ily arises from
partial debonding of the polymeric graft/solvent from the particle surface and
the formation of polymer bridges between particles. Thus, the implementation of
dynamic covalent chemistry provides a new molecular handle with which to tailor
the macroscopic rheology of suspensions by introducing programable time
dependence. These studies open the door to energy absorbing materials that not
only sense mechanical inputs and adjust their dissipation as a function of time
or shear rate but can switch between these two modalities on demand.

(RKHS) usually assume quite restrictive properties on the shape of the domain,

  In this paper we leverage an analysis of greedy kernel algorithms to prove
that it is possible to obtain convergence results (in the number of
interpolation points) for kernel interpolation for arbitrary domains $\Omega
\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, thus allowing for non-Lipschitz domains including e.g.
cusps and irregular boundaries. Especially we show that, when going to a
smaller domain $\tilde{\Omega} \subset \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, the
convergence rate does not deteriorate - i.e. the convergence rates are stable
with respect to going to a subset.
  The impact of this result is explained on the examples of kernels of finite

approximation in Sobolev spaces is drawn, where the shape of the domain
$\Omega$ has an impact on the approximation properties. Numerical experiments
illustrate and confirm the experiments.

finite deterministic automaton: to compare states we use the order of the
strings reaching them. When the order on strings is the co-lexicographic one
\emph{and} this order turns out to be total, the DFA is called Wheeler. This
recently introduced class of automata -- the \emph{Wheeler automata} --
constitute an important data-structure for languages, since it allows the
design and implementation of a very efficient tool-set of storage mechanisms
for the transition function, supporting a large variety of substring queries.
  In this context it is natural to consider the class of regular languages
accepted by Wheeler automata, i.e. the Wheeler languages. An inspiring result
in this area is the following: it has been shown that, as opposed to the
general case, the classic determinization by powerset construction is
\emph{polynomial} on Wheeler automata. As a consequence, most classical
problems, when considered on this class of automata, turn out to be ""easy"" --
that is, solvable in polynomial time.
  In this paper we consider computational problems related to Wheelerness, but
starting from non-deterministic automata. We also consider the case of
\emph{reduced} non-deterministic ones -- a class of NFA where recognizing
Wheelerness is still polynomial, as for DFA's. Our collection of results shows
that moving towards non-determinism is, in most cases, a dangerous path leading
quickly to intractability.
  Moreover, we start a study of ""state complexity"" related to Wheeler DFA and
languages, proving that the classic construction for the intersection of
languages turns out to be computationally simpler on Wheeler DFA than in the
general case. We also provide a construction for the minimum Wheeler DFA
recognizing a given Wheeler language.

treatment effect in the presence of fully observed confounding variables using
two-stage semiparametric methods. In existing theoretical studies of methods
such as G-computation, inverse propensity weighting (IPW), and two common
doubly robust estimators -- augmented IPW (AIPW) and targeted maximum
likelihood estimation (TMLE) -- they are either bias-dominated, or have similar
asymptotic statistical properties. However, when applied to real datasets, they
often appear to have notably different variance. We compare these methods when
using a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the nuisance parameters of the
semiparametric model, and highlight some of the important differences. When the
outcome model estimates have little bias, which is common among some key ML
models, G-computation and the TMLE outperforms the other estimators in both
bias and variance.
  We show that the differences can be explained using high-dimensional
statistical theory, where the number of confounders $d$ is of the same order as
the sample size $n$. To make this theoretical problem tractable, we posit a
generalized linear model for the effect of the confounders on the treatment
assignment and outcomes. Despite making parametric assumptions, this setting is
a useful surrogate for some machine learning methods used to adjust for
confounding in two-stage semiparametric methods. In particular, the estimation
of the first stage adds variance that does not vanish, forcing us to confront
terms in the asymptotic expansion that normally are brushed aside as finite
sample defects. However, our model emphasizes differences in performance
between these estimators beyond first-order asymptotics.

We use superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to spoil T2 of water

diffusion constant, dependent only on the temperature in a specific
environment. Our results show, for pure water, the nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) linewidth and T2 follow the same temperature dependence as the
self-diffusion constant of water. Thus, T2 mapping is a diffusion mapping in
the presence of SPIONs, and T2 is a thermometer. For pure water, a T2 mapping
of a 64 x 64 image (voxel size = 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm x 3 mm) in a 9.4 T MRI scanner
resulted in a temperature resolution of 0.5 K for a scan time of 2 minutes.

  Due to the singular nonlinearity and to presence of nonlocal diffusion

  Once solutions exists and are bounded we show that they extinguish in finite

energy of the system involving various short-range and long-range interactions.
In an unstable condition, thin liquid films may dewet into multiple small-sized
droplets via spinodal, homogeneous, or heterogeneous nucleation process.
However, if the total excess free energy of the system can be manipulated using
an external stimulus, one can control the stability of thin liquid films on
demand. Here, we study the reversible dewetting process of thin lubricating
films underneath aqueous drops on slippery surfaces using an external electric
field. Upon applying voltage, stable thin lubricating films dewet in a manner
identical to the spinodal dewetting of nanometer-thick liquid films. Upon
removing the applied voltage, the dewetted droplets spread, coalesce with
neighboring ones, and form a uniform film again, however the time taken during
rewetting is very different compared to dewetting. The characteristic features
of both the dewetting and rewetting processes are present over multiple cycles.
Due to the random nature of the spinodal dewetting process, the final dewetting
pattern does not show any correlation over multiple dewetting cycles.

cosmology, their origin is still unknown to date. One of the interesting topics
is the classification of FRBs, which is closely related to the origin of FRBs.
Different physical mechanisms are required by different classes of FRBs. In the
literature, they usually could be classified into non-repeating and repeating
FRBs. Well motivated by the observations, here we are interested in the
possible subclassification of FRBs. By using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we
propose to subclassify non-repeating (type I) FRBs into type Ia and Ib FRBs.
The distribution of type Ia FRBs is delayed with respect to the cosmic star
formation history (SFH), and hence they are probably associated with old
stellar populations, while the distribution of type Ib FRBs tracks SFH, and
hence they are probably associated with young stellar populations. Accordingly,
the physical criteria for this subclassification of type I FRBs have been
clearly determined. We find that there are some tight empirical correlations
for type Ia FRBs but not for type Ib FRBs, and vice versa. These make them
different in physical properties. Similarly, we suggest that repeating (type
II) FRBs could also be subclassified into type IIa and IIb FRBs. A universal
subclassification scheme is given at the end. This subclassification of FRBs
might help us to reveal quite different physical mechanisms behind them, and
improve their applications in astronomy and cosmology.

we generalize the two-dimensional largest common substructure (2D-LCS) problem,

them also poses significant scalability challenges for inference for real-time

are paired with pixel-wise monthly semantic segmentation labels of 7 land use

provides this unique combination of daily measurements and high-quality labels.
In our experiments, we compare several established baselines that either
utilize the daily observations as additional training data (semi-supervised

in the near-infrared ($YJ$ band) is conducted to test new methods, to confirm
and improve existing parameters, and to search for new DIBs.
  Methods: The CRyogenic high-resolution InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES)
on the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope was employed to
obtain spectra of four reddened background supergiant stars (HD 183143, HD
165784, HD 92207, HD 111613) and an unreddened comparison star (HD 87737) at
the highest resolution of $R \approx 100000$ currently achievable at
near-infrared wavelengths. The correction for telluric absorption was performed
by a modelling approach. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral modelling
of available optical and the new near-infrared spectra facilitated a
comprehensive characterisation of the atmospheric properties of the background
stars. A more precise and accurate determination of the reddening law along the
sight lines could be achieved than feasible before by comparison of the
observed and model spectral energy distributions. For DIBs that overlap with
stellar lines the DIB profile shapes could be recovered.
  Results: Seventeen known near-infrared DIBs were confirmed, and 12 previously
unknown and generally weaker DIBs were identified in the $YJ$ band. Three DIBs
that show uniform profiles along all sight lines were identified, possibly
connected to transitions from a common lower state of the same carrier. The
divergent extinction curve towards the frequently discussed DIB standard star
HD 183143 could be reproduced for the first time, requiring extra absorption by
$\sim$3.5 mag due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to match the
ultraviolet extinction bump. This extra absorption probably stems from a
circumstellar bubble lying in front of the star which is intersected
tangentially by the line of sight.

characterization yields a set of quantities satisfying the coupled pentagon
equations, associated with a module category over the fusion category that
describes the MPO symmetry. Equivalence classes of these quantities provide
complete invariants for an MPO symmetry protected phase: they are robust under
continuous deformations of the MPS tensor, and two phases with the same
equivalence class can be connected by a symmetric gapped path. Our techniques
match and extend the known renormalization fixed point classifications and
facilitate the numerical study of these systems. For MPO symmetries described
by a group, we recover the symmetry protected topological order classification
for unique and degenerate ground states. Moreover, we study the interplay
between time reversal symmetry and an MPO symmetry and we also provide examples
of our classification, together with explicit constructions based on groups.
Finally, we elaborate on the connection between our setup and gapped boundaries

short history of the problem and the known objections about considering time a

through some unresolved problems. The lack of a consistent theory of time is
currently hindering the formulation of a full-fledged theory of quantum
gravity. It is argued that the proposal set forth by several authors of
considering an intrinsic measurement of quantum time, besides having the
conventional external time, is compelling. Recently several suggestions have
been put forward to revive the proposal of Page and Wootters (1983),
elaborating and resolving some of the main ambiguities of the original proposal
and opening new scope for understanding its content. The approach followed in
these new contributions exposes the need to go beyond the limitations enforced
by the conventional approach of quantum physics. The attitude of covariant loop
quantum gravity, in which it is called to completely ignore time, is also
discussed. This review could be a step forward in an endeavour to reform our
outlook of the unification of the theory of relativity and quantum physics by
furnishing the conceptual ground needed for this goal. Intentionally, some
technical details are avoided since we aim to present the approaches to resolve
the problem in a simple way with the clearest possible outlook. These can be

discriminative features, and learn inter-class correlation. However, few
related works pay attention to the robustness of the attention module itself.
Through experiments, we found neural attention maps initialized with different

identical Region of Interest (ROI). In other words, similar to general feature
learning, the representational quality of attention maps also greatly affects
the performance of a model, which means unconstrained attention learning has
lots of randomnesses. This uncertainty lets conventional attention learning
fall into sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a compact model to enhance the

e-values; examples include those constructed via supermartingale methods, or
via universal inference, or via Chernoff-style bounds on the moment generating

recent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking with an extremely
high ratio. This simple design makes video reconstruction a more challenging
self-supervision task, thus encouraging extracting more effective video
representations during this pre-training process. We obtain three important
findings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90%
to 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally
redundant video content enables a higher masking ratio than that of images. (2)
VideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.e., around 3k-4k
videos) without using any extra data. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is
more important than data quantity for SSVP. Domain shift between pre-training
and target datasets is an important issue. Notably, our VideoMAE with the
vanilla ViT can achieve 87.4% on Kinetics-400, 75.4% on Something-Something V2,

obtained exclusively in terms of the inverse of the collision matrix. This
procedure fixes unambiguously the relaxation times of the dissipative

using hand-held captured images under natural light conditions. It combines the
advantage of explicit mesh and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network, a hybrid
representation, to simplify the capture setting used in recent contributions.
After obtaining an initial shape through the multi-view silhouettes, we
introduce surface-based local MLPs to encode the vertex displacement field
(VDF) for the reconstruction of surface details. The design of local MLPs
allows to represent the VDF in a piece-wise manner using two layer MLP
networks, which is beneficial to the optimization algorithm. Defining local
MLPs on the surface instead of the volume also reduces the searching space.
Such a hybrid representation enables us to relax the ray-pixel correspondences
that represent the light path constraint to our designed ray-cell
correspondences, which significantly simplifies the implementation of
single-image based environment matting algorithm. We evaluate our
representation and reconstruction algorithm on several transparent objects with

  remodeling: Analyzing mechanobiological stability and reversal",,,,,"q-bio.TO physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cardiac growth and remodeling (G&R) patterns change ventricular size, shape,
and function both globally and locally. Biomechanical, neurohormonal, and
genetic stimuli drive these patterns through changes in myocyte dimension and
fibrosis. We propose a novel microstructure-motivated model that predicts
organ-scale G&R in the heart based on the homogenized constrained mixture
theory. Previous models, based on the kinematic growth theory, reproduced
consequences of G&R in bulk myocardial tissue by prescribing the direction and
extent of growth but neglected underlying cellular mechanisms. In our model,
the direction and extent of G&R emerge naturally from intra- and extra cellular
turnover processes in myocardial tissue constituents and their preferred
homeostatic stretch state. We additionally propose a method to obtain a
mechanobiologically equilibrated reference configuration. We test our model on
an idealized 3D left ventricular geometry and demonstrate that our model aims
to maintain tensional homeostasis in hypertension conditions. In a stability
map, we identify regions of stable and unstable G&R from an identical parameter
set with varying systolic pressures and growth factors. Furthermore, we show
the extent of G&R reversal after returning the systolic pressure to baseline
following stage 1 and 2 hypertension. A realistic model of organ-scale cardiac
G&R has the potential to identify patients at risk of heart failure, enable
personalized cardiac therapies, and facilitate the optimal design of medical
devices.

as Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and medical imaging.
However, it has not been fully explored for clinical data analysis. Even though
an immense amount of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is recorded, data and
labels can be scarce if the data is collected in small hospitals or deals with
rare diseases. In such scenarios, pre-training on a larger set of EHR data
could improve the model performance. In this paper, we apply unsupervised
pre-training to heterogeneous, multi-modal EHR data for patient outcome
prediction. To model this data, we leverage graph deep learning over population
graphs. We first design a network architecture based on graph transformer
designed to handle various input feature types occurring in EHR data, like
continuous, discrete, and time-series features, allowing better multi-modal
data fusion. Further, we design pre-training methods based on masked imputation
to pre-train our network before fine-tuning on different end tasks.
Pre-training is done in a fully unsupervised fashion, which lays the groundwork
for pre-training on large public datasets with different tasks and similar
modalities in the future. We test our method on two medical datasets of patient
records, TADPOLE and MIMIC-III, including imaging and non-imaging features and
different prediction tasks. We find that our proposed graph based pre-training
method helps in modeling the data at a population level and further improves
performance on the fine tuning tasks in terms of AUC on average by 4.15% for
MIMIC and 7.64% for TADPOLE.

superconductors [J. F. Karcher et al, Annals of Physics, 435, 168584 (2021)]. A
mapping to classical percolation is developed for a certain set of
generalized-multifractality observables. In this way, exact analytical results
for the corresponding exponents are obtained. Furthermore, a general
construction of positive pure-scaling eigenfunction observables is presented,
which permits a very efficient numerical determination of scaling exponents. In
particular, all exponents corresponding to polynomial pure-scaling observables
up to the order $q=5$ are found numerically. For the observables for which the
percolation mapping is derived, analytical and numerical results are in perfect
agreement with each other. The analytical and numerical results unambiguously
demonstrate that the generalized parabolicity (i.e., proportionality to
eigenvalues of the quadratic Casimir operator) does not hold for the spectrum
of generalized-multifractality exponents. This excludes
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models, and, more generally, any theories with local
conformal invariance, as candidates for the fixed-point theory of the spin
quantum Hall transition. The observable construction developed in this work
paves a way to investigation of generalized multifractality at

However, if the two baths are switched around, a heat current is observed. An
implementation using a qutrit coupled to two harmonic oscillators is proposed
and rectification values beyond $10^3$ are achieved for realistic parameter
values. Furthermore, we show that the heat current can be amplified by an order
of magnitude through external driving without diminishing the diode

First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES). We employ the large
effective volume of FLARES to produce a sizeable sample of high redshift
galaxies with intrinsic and observed luminosities and half light radii in a
range of rest frame UV and visual photometric bands. This sample contains a
significant number of intrinsically ultra-compact galaxies in the far-UV (1500
angstrom), leading to a negative intrinsic far-UV size-luminosity relation.
However, after the inclusion of the effects of dust these same compact galaxies
exhibit observed sizes that are as much as 50 times larger than those measured
from the intrinsic emission, and broadly agree with a range of observational
samples. This increase in size is driven by the concentration of dust in the
core of galaxies, heavily attenuating the intrinsically brightest regions. At
fixed luminosity we find a galaxy size redshift evolution with a slope of
$m=1.21-1.87$ depending on the luminosity sample in question, and we
demonstrate the wavelength dependence of the size-luminosity relation which

is related to the pure Lee-Yang CFT in two less dimensions. We study the model
using replica trick and Cardy variables in $d=8-\epsilon$ where the RG flow is
perturbative. Allowed perturbations are singlets under the $S_n$ symmetry that
permutes the $n$ replicas. These are decomposed into operators with different
scaling dimensions: the lowest dimensional part, `leader', controls the RG flow
in the IR; the other operators, `followers', can be neglected. The leaders are
classified into: susy-writable, susy-null and non-susy-writable according to
their mixing properties. We construct low lying leaders and compute the
anomalous dimensions of a number of them. We argue that there is no operator
that can destabilize the SUSY RG flow in $d\le 8$. This agrees with the well
known numerical result for critical exponents of Branched Polymers (which are
in the same universality class as the random field $\phi^3$ model) that match
the ones of the pure Lee-Yang fixed point according to dimensional reduction in

optimization problems on quantum annealers (QA). The computational premise of
quantum computers has cultivated the re-design of various existing vision
problems into quantum-friendly forms. Experimental QA realizations can solve a
particular non-convex problem known as the quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO). Yet a naive-QUBO cannot take into account the restrictions
on the parameters. To introduce additional structure in the parameter space,
researchers have crafted ad-hoc solutions incorporating (linear) constraints in
the form of regularizers. However, this comes at the expense of a
hyper-parameter, balancing the impact of regularization. To date, a true
constrained solver of quadratic binary optimization (QBO) problems has lacked.
Q-FW first reformulates constrained-QBO as a copositive program (CP), then
employs Frank-Wolfe iterations to solve CP while satisfying linear (in)equality
constraints. This procedure unrolls the original constrained-QBO into a set of
unconstrained QUBOs all of which are solved, in a sequel, on a QA. We use
D-Wave Advantage QA to conduct synthetic and real experiments on two important

barrier for tunneling from ""nothing"" into a classical universe becomes thinner
and lower, should torsion be present even if only off-shell. This is confirmed
by a detailed calculation, where the usual assumptions are re-evaluated and
repurposed in our situation. Interestingly some approximations used in the
literature (such as the WKB approximation) are not needed in general, and in
particular in our case. When we consider wave packets centered around zero
torsion, however, the conclusion depends crucially how these are built. With a
Klein-Gordon current prescription for the measure and probability, for small
torsion variance, {\sigma}_c, we recover the plane wave results. Nonetheless,
for large {\sigma}c, higher order corrections could reverse this conclusion.

and validate an efficient strategy for using computational fluid dynamics (CFD)

the test case of a single-room home in a dense urban slum. The method
characterizes the dimensionless ventilation rate as a function of the
dimensionless ventilation Richardson number and the wind direction. First, the
high-fidelity large-eddy simulation predictions are validated against
full-scale ventilation rate measurements. Next, simulations with identical
Richardson numbers, but varying dimensional wind speeds and temperatures, are
compared to verify the proposed similarity relationship. Last, the functional
form of the similarity relationship is determined based on 32 LES. Validation
of the surrogate model against full-scale measurements demonstrates that the

($R_{\mathcal{O}}$) such as the multiplicity distribution,
$p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$, and the harmonic flow, $v_n$, deviate from unity, when
presented as a function of centrality, $c$. These deviations have been
attributed to the differences in the shape and radial profiles between

depend on the choice of the event activity variable $x$, which could be either
$N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ or centrality. We estimate the difference $\Delta R$ between
these two choices, based on the published $p(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$, as well as
those from a multiphase transport (AMPT) model with varied nuclear structure
parameters: nuclear radius ($R_0$), surface diffuseness ($a_0$), quadrupole
deformation ($\beta_2$), and octupole deformation ($\beta_3$). In contrary to
$R_{v_n}(c)$, $R_{v_n}(N_{\mathrm{ch}})$ is nearly independent of the analysis
approaches, suggesting that nonflow effects are better controlled by
$N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ than $c$. The ratios of observables sensitive to the chiral
magnetic effect (CME) are also much closer to unity for $x=N_{\mathrm{ch}}$
than $x=c$, indicating that the ratios calculated at the same $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$
provide a better baseline for the non-CME background. According to the AMPT
results, the dominant parameter for $\Delta R$ is $a_0$, while $R_0$ and
$\beta_n$ are only important in central collisions. The published

overcomes this limitation by probing two quantum systems with the same noisy

on-going and future large-volume survey are targeting smaller objects, e.g.
emission line galaxies, compared to the earlier focus, i.e. luminous red

work we present a machine learning (ML) approach to calibrate the halo
catalogue of a low-resolution (LR) simulation by training with a paired
high-resolution (HR) simulation with the same background white noise, thus we
can build the training data by matching HR haloes to LR haloes in a one-to-one
fashion. After training, the calibrated LR halo catalogue reproduces the
mass-clustering relation for mass down to $2.5\times 10^{11}~h^{-1}M_\odot$
within $5~{\rm per~cent}$ at scales $k<1~h\,\rm Mpc^{-1}$. We validate the
performance of different statistics including halo mass function, power

policies (DRPs) for continuous MDP planning by encoding a parametric policy as
a deep neural network and exploiting automatic differentiation in an end-to-end
model-based gradient descent framework. This approach has proven effective for
optimizing DRPs in nonlinear continuous MDPs, but it requires a large number of
sampled trajectories to learn effectively and can suffer from high variance in
solution quality. In this work, we revisit the overall model-based DRP
objective and instead take a minorization-maximization perspective to
iteratively optimize the DRP w.r.t. a locally tight lower-bounded objective.
This novel formulation of DRP learning as iterative lower bound optimization
(ILBO) is particularly appealing because (i) each step is structurally easier
to optimize than the overall objective, (ii) it guarantees a monotonically
improving objective under certain theoretical conditions, and (iii) it reuses
samples between iterations thus lowering sample complexity. Empirical
evaluation confirms that ILBO is significantly more sample-efficient than the
state-of-the-art DRP planner and consistently produces better solution quality
with lower variance. We additionally demonstrate that ILBO generalizes well to
new problem instances (i.e., different initial states) without requiring
retraining.

operations (e.g. atrous convolutions) are necessary for accurate semantic
segmentation, resulting in slow speed and large memory usage. In this paper, we
question this belief and demonstrate that neither high internal resolution nor
atrous convolutions are necessary. Our intuition is that although segmentation
is a dense per-pixel prediction task, the semantics of each pixel often depend
on both nearby neighbors and far-away context; therefore, a more powerful
multi-scale feature fusion network plays a critical role. Following this
intuition, we revisit the conventional multi-scale feature space (typically
capped at P5) and extend it to a much richer space, up to P9, where the
smallest features are only 1/512 of the input size and thus have very large
receptive fields. To process such a rich feature space, we leverage the recent
BiFPN to fuse the multi-scale features. Based on these insights, we develop a
simplified segmentation model, named ESeg, which has neither high internal
resolution nor expensive atrous convolutions. Perhaps surprisingly, our simple
method can achieve better accuracy with faster speed than prior art across
multiple datasets. In real-time settings, ESeg-Lite-S achieves 76.0% mIoU on

measurements of the rates of the SM-like Higgs-boson at the LHC, as well as
flavor observables and electroweak precision data. For the SM-type triple Higgs

derive stellar parameters and chemical abundances at low spectral resolution
(R~2000). We reanalysed 1584 MUSE spectra of 1061 stars above the turn-off of
NGC 6397 using FERRE and employing two different synthetic libraries. We derive
the equivalent iron abundance \fehe for fixed values of \afe. We find that (i)
the interpolation schema and grid mesh are not critical for the precision,
metallicity spread, and trend; (ii) with the two grids, \fehe increases by ~0.2
dex along the sub-giant branch, starting from the turn-off of the main
sequence; (iii) restricting the wavelength range to the optical decreases the
precision significantly; and (iv) the precision obtained with the synthetic
libraries is lower than the precision obtained previously with empirical
libraries. Full-spectrum fitting provides reproducible results that are robust
to the choice of the reference grid of synthetic spectra and to the details of
the analysis. The \fehe increase along the sub-giant branch is in stark
contrast with the nearly constant iron abundance previously found with
empirical libraries. The precision of the measurements (0.05 dex on \fehe) is
currently not sufficient to assess the intrinsic chemical abundance spreads,
but this may change with deeper observations. Improvements of the synthetic
spectra are still needed to deliver the full possibilities of full-spectrum
fitting.

confirmed that trust had a significant effect on the intention to use AI, which
operated through perceived usefulness and participants' attitude toward voice

model is not available, in the context of more rare and harmful outcomes.
Standard estimators are not effective in making predictions about such outcomes
due to their rarity. Instead, we use Extreme Value Theory (EVT), the theory of
the long-term behaviour of normalized maxima of random variables. We quantify
risk using the upper-semideviation $\rho(Y) = E(\max\{Y - \mu,0\})$ of an
integrable random variable $Y$ with mean $\mu = E(Y)$. $\rho(Y)$ is the
risk-aware part of the common mean-upper-semideviation functional $\mu +
\lambda \rho(Y)$ with $\lambda \in [0,1]$. To assess more rare and harmful
outcomes, we propose an EVT-based estimator for $\rho(Y)$ in a given fraction
of the worst cases. We show that our estimator enjoys a closed-form
representation in terms of the popular conditional value-at-risk functional. In
experiments, we illustrate the extrapolation power of our estimator using a
small number of i.i.d. samples ($<$50). Our approach is useful for estimating
the risk of finite-time systems when models are inaccessible and data
collection is expensive. The numerical complexity does not grow with the size
of the state space.

cannot scale to larger devices. Attempts to remedy this include new schemes

non-uniform RB, but they do not fall within the group-based RB framework. In
this work, we formulate the \emph{universal randomized benchmarking (URB)

of new schemes. We specifically consider a class of URB schemes called
\emph{twirling schemes}. For twirling schemes, the post-processing POVM
approximately factorizes into an intermediate channel, inverting maps, and a
final measurement. This leads us to study the twirling map corresponding to the
gate ensemble specified by the scheme. We prove that if this twirling map is
strictly within unit distance of the Haar twirling map in induced diamond norm,
the probability of measurement as a function of gate length is a single
exponential decay up to small error terms. The core technical tool we use is
the matrix perturbation theory of linear operators on quantum channels.

behavior in response to the robot. On the one hand this is challenging because
the robot must learn to coordinate with a dynamic partner. But on the other
hand -- if the robot understands these dynamics -- it can harness its own
behavior, influence the human, and guide the team towards effective
collaboration. Prior research enables robots to learn to influence other robots
or simulated agents. In this paper we extend these learning approaches to now
influence humans. What makes humans especially hard to influence is that -- not
only do humans react to the robot -- but the way a single user reacts to the
robot may change over time, and different humans will respond to the same robot
behavior in different ways. We therefore propose a robust approach that learns
to influence changing partner dynamics. Our method first trains with a set of
partners across repeated interactions, and learns to predict the current
partner's behavior based on the previous states, actions, and rewards. Next, we
rapidly adapt to new partners by sampling trajectories the robot learned with
the original partners, and then leveraging those existing behaviors to
influence the new partner dynamics. We compare our resulting algorithm to
state-of-the-art baselines across simulated environments and a user study where
the robot and participants collaborate to build towers. We find that our
approach outperforms the alternatives, even when the partner follows new or
unexpected dynamics. Videos of the user study are available here:

infinite number of translation functions can map the source domain distribution
to the target distribution. Therefore, much effort has been put into designing
suitable constraints, e.g., cycle consistency (CycleGAN), geometry consistency
(GCGAN), and contrastive learning-based constraints (CUTGAN), that help better
pose the problem. However, these well-known constraints have limitations: (1)
they are either too restrictive or too weak for specific I2I tasks; (2) these
methods result in content distortion when there is a significant spatial
variation between the source and target domains. This paper proposes a
universal regularization technique called maximum spatial perturbation
consistency (MSPC), which enforces a spatial perturbation function (T ) and the
translation operator (G) to be commutative (i.e., TG = GT ). In addition, we
introduce two adversarial training components for learning the spatial
perturbation function. The first one lets T compete with G to achieve maximum
perturbation. The second one lets G and T compete with discriminators to align
the spatial variations caused by the change of object size, object distortion,
background interruptions, etc. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods on most I2I benchmarks. We also introduce a new benchmark, namely the
front face to profile face dataset, to emphasize the underlying challenges of
I2I for real-world applications. We finally perform ablation experiments to
study the sensitivity of our method to the severity of spatial perturbation and
its effectiveness for distribution alignment.

  Prediction and Interpretation","AAAI 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural language models show vulnerability to adversarial examples which are
semantically similar to their original counterparts with a few words replaced
by their synonyms. A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial
training which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a
target model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these
adversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to
make a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial
example pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two
similar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave
consistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same
predictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by
consistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level
adversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness
in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational
word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a
bottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words.
FLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch
between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in
original/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global
word importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving
the robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four
neural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks
on four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better
robustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across
different attacks.

in representation learning - the need for human annotations. As a result, SSL
holds the promise to learn representations from data in-the-wild, i.e., without
the need for finite and static datasets. Instead, true SSL algorithms should be
able to exploit the continuous stream of data being generated on the internet
or by agents exploring their environments. But do traditional self-supervised
learning approaches work in this setup? In this work, we investigate this
question by conducting experiments on the continuous self-supervised learning
problem. While learning in the wild, we expect to see a continuous (infinite)
non-IID data stream that follows a non-stationary distribution of visual
concepts. The goal is to learn a representation that can be robust, adaptive
yet not forgetful of concepts seen in the past. We show that a direct
application of current methods to such continuous setup is 1) inefficient both
computationally and in the amount of data required, 2) leads to inferior
representations due to temporal correlations (non-IID data) in some sources of
streaming data and 3) exhibits signs of catastrophic forgetting when trained on
sources with non-stationary data distributions. We propose the use of replay
buffers as an approach to alleviate the issues of inefficiency and temporal
correlations. We further propose a novel method to enhance the replay buffer by
maintaining the least redundant samples. Minimum redundancy (MinRed) buffers
allow us to learn effective representations even in the most challenging
streaming scenarios composed of sequential visual data obtained from a single
embodied agent, and alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting when
learning from data with non-stationary semantic distributions.

by utilizing data from previous frames, which are generally characterized by
distinct propagation characteristics, in order to enable fast training on the
time slots of the current frame. The proposed predictors rely on a novel

single-antenna frequency-flat channels based on transfer/meta-learned quadratic
regularization. Then, we introduce transfer and meta-learning algorithms for
LSTD-based prediction models that build on equilibrium propagation (EP) and
alternating least squares (ALS). Numerical results under the 3GPP 5G standard

we instead seek to achieve general-purpose data backwards compatibility. This
would allow the adapted covariates to be used for a variety of downstream
problems, including on pre-existing prediction models and on data analytics

demonstrating the use of parametric and nonparametric Gaussian estimators of

algorithms are able to tackle the problem with low memory overhead. Exsisting
out-of-core algorithms mainly work in a streaming manner and can be grouped
into two types. While \emph{stateless} streaming edge partitioning is fast and
yields low partitioning quality, stateful streaming edge partitioning yields
better quality, but is expensive, as it requires a scoring function to be
evaluated for every edge on every partition, leading to a time complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(|E|*k)$. In this paper, we propose 2PS-L, a novel out-of-core edge
partitioning algorithm that builds upon the stateful streaming model, but
achieves linear run-time (i.e., $\mathcal{O}(|E|)$). 2PS-L consists of two
phases. In the first phase, vertices are separated into clusters by a
lightweight streaming clustering algorithm. In the second phase, the graph is
re-streamed and vertex clustering from the first phase is exploited to reduce
the search space of graph partitioning to only two target partitions for every
edge. Our evaluations show that 2PS-L can achieve better partitioning quality
than existing stateful streaming edge partitioners while having a much lower
run-time. As a consequence, the total run-time of partitioning and subsequent

underlying antiferromagnetic order, leaving behind it a string of ""wrong""

systems, it has become possible in cold atom experiments due to recent
experimental advances. Here, we point out the key feature of the holon strings,
i.e. its Marshall phase, can be observed through measurements of spin
correlations. Moreover, the interference of these strings leads to an
anisotropic holon propagation clearly distinguishable than those of spinless

examine how a shift to online-only sex work impacted: (1) working conditions,
(2) risks and protective behaviors, and (3) labor rewards. We find that online
work offers benefits to sex workers' financial and physical well-being.
However, online-only work introduces new and greater digital and mental health

optoelectronics, photocatalysis and biosensing applications, among others.
Thermoplasmonic approaches have demonstrated unrivalled performance for
controlling surface temperature, in terms of spatial resolution and thermal
amplitude. Most efforts have been done on optimizing the temperature gradient
and developing nanoscale temperature patterns. Alternatively, a temperature
gradient-free thermoplasmonic surface will enable further functionalities. For
example, a constant temperature area of a few square microns can be employed to
tune the gap of a 2D crystal or to control transition in a phase change
material without the need of local resistive heaters and external electronics.
In this work, we present a thermoplasmonic platform conceived for this purpose.
It consists of an array of gold nanoantennas on a 'silicon on insulator'
substrate, where the heat is generated by a laser beam focused on the array,
diffused over the whole silicon layer and confined in the vertical direction by
the insulator underneath. As an advantage to previous approaches, heat
diffusion allows the temperature control at a desired distance from the
excitation spot, thus showing the proposed platform as a candidate for hosting
and controlling the temperature during the characterization of light-sensitive
materials.

with slow convergence and/or robustness of performance due to the considerable
heterogeneity of data distribution, computation and communication capability at
the edge. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by focusing on the key
component of model aggregation in federated learning systems and studying
optimal algorithms to perform this task. Particularly, we propose a contextual
aggregation scheme that achieves the optimal context-dependent bound on loss
reduction in each round of optimization. The aforementioned context-dependent
bound is derived from the particular participating devices in that round and an
assumption on smoothness of the overall loss function. We show that this
aggregation leads to a definite reduction of loss function at every round.
Furthermore, we can integrate our aggregation with many existing algorithms to
obtain the contextual versions. Our experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in convergence speed and robustness of the contextual
versions compared to the original algorithms. We also consider different
variants of the contextual aggregation and show robust performance even in the
most extreme settings.

may be imprinted as an absorption signal in the 21cm line of HI against the
CMB, when the Universe was less than 200 Myr old. To explain the additional
large amplitude of the 21cm HI absorption reported by EDGES there have been
proposed models based on an additional synchrotron Cosmic Radio Background
(CRB) from BH-jet sources that boost the HI absorption signal at CD. The recent
observations of radio loud supermassive BHs (SMBHs) in high-z quasars up to z=7
suggest the existence of a CRB from growing BHs at z > 15, of unknown
intensity. To match the onset of the EDGES signal a CRB of comparable intensity
to that of the CMB is required. Here we provide approximate calculations to
analyze this type of absorption signals, taking that of EDGES as an example.
Assuming a BH mass to radio luminosity ratio as observed in radio-loud SMBHs of
~10^9 solar masses in quasars at z = 6-7, we find that rapidly growing radio
luminous BHs of Intermediate Mass (IMBHs) in their way to become SMBHs, are the
only type of astrophysical radio sources of a CRB that could explain the
amplitude of the HI absorption reported by EDGES in the interval of z = 18-20.
At those redshifts the EDGES signal would imply that the global mass density of
IMBHs must be dominant over that of stars, more than 70% of the maximum Stellar
Mass Density (SMD) expected at those high redshifts. This suggests that those
IMBHs are formed before and grow faster than the bulk of stars, with no large
mass contribution from stellar-mass BH remnants of typical Pop III stars. The
highly redshifted signals from these IMBHs may be detected at long radio
wavelengths with ultrasensitive interferometers such as the SKA, in the
infrared with the JWST, and in the X-rays with future space missions.

the modest velocity of the H{\alpha}. We propose that the infrared flux
originates from a toroidal-like structure of hydrogen surrounding the
progenitor system, while later emission at other wavelengths (radio, X-ray)
likely originates predominantly from the reverse shock in the ejecta and the
forward shock in the quasi-spherical progenitor He wind. We propose that the

the first to evaluate state-of-the-art DML methods trained on imbalanced data,

fairness in DML through an analysis of three properties of the representation

propose finDML, the fairness in non-balanced DML benchmark to characterize
representation fairness. Utilizing finDML, we find bias in DML representations
to propagate to common downstream classification tasks. Surprisingly, this bias
is propagated even when training data in the downstream task is re-balanced. To
address this problem, we present Partial Attribute De-correlation (PARADE) to
de-correlate feature representations from sensitive attributes and reduce

increases, the action cycle time in sequential implementation could grow
excessively long, while the asynchronous implementation can always maintain an
appropriate action cycle time. Consequently, when learning updates are
expensive, the performance of sequential learning diminishes and is
outperformed by asynchronous learning by a substantial margin. Our system

high-resolution EAGLE simulations. We find a strong degree of correlation
between the WHIM density and the galaxy luminosity density, resulting in a
scaling relation between the two quantities that permits to predict the WHIM
density of filaments with a scatter of less than $\frac{1}{2}$ dex in a broad
range of smoothed filament luminosity densities. In order to estimate the
performance of the simulation-based calibration of the LD-WHIM density
relation, we applied it to a sample of low-redshift filaments detected with the
\emph{Bisous} method in the Legacy Survey SDSS~DR12 data. In the volume covered
by the SDSS data, our relation predicts a WHIM density amounting to
$31\pm7\pm12$ % (statistical errors followed by systematic) of cosmic baryon
density. This agrees, albeit within the large uncertainties, with the current
estimates of the cosmological missing baryon fraction, implying that our
LD-WHIM density relation may be a useful tool in the search for the missing
baryons. This method of analysis provides a new promising avenue to study the
physical properties of the missing baryons, using an observable that is
available for large volumes of the sky, complementary and independent from WHIM
searches with absorption-line systems in the FUV or X-rays.

Of particular interests in Co$_{0.29}$TaS$_{2}$ are abundant magnetic
transitions, which show that the magnetic structures are tuned by temperature
or magnetic field. With decreasing temperature, Co$_{0.29}$TaS$_{2}$ undergoes
two transitions at T$_{t1}\sim$ 38.3 K and T$_{t2}\sim$ 24.3 K. Once the
magnetic field is applied, another transition T$_{t3}\sim$ 34.3 K appears
between 0.3 T and 5 T. At 2 K, an obvious ferromagnetic hysteresis loop within
H$_{t1}\sim\pm$ 6.9 T is observed, which decreases with increasing temperature
and eventually disappears at T$_{t2}$. Besides, Co$_{0.29}$TaS$_{2}$ displays
step-like behavior as another magnetic transition around H$_{t2}\sim\pm$ 4 T,
which exists until $\sim$ T$_{t1}$. These characteristic temperatures and
magnetic fields mark complex magnetic phase transitions in
Co$_{0.29}$TaS$_{2}$, which are also evidenced in transport results. Large AHE
dominates in the Hall resistivity with the conspicuous value of
R$_{s}$/R$_{0}\sim 10^{5}$, considering that the tiny net magnetization
(0.0094$\mu_{B}$/Co) alone would not lead to this value, thus the contribution
of Berry curvature is necessary. The longitudinal resistivity illustrates a
prominent irreversible behavior within H$_{t1}$. The abrupt change at H$_{t2}$
below T$_{t1}$, corresponding to the step-like magnetic transitions, is also
observed. Synergy between the magnetism and topological properties, both
playing a crucial role, may be the key factor of large AHE in antiferromagnet,
which also offers a new perspective in magnetic topological materials with the
platform of Co$_{0.29}$TaS$_{2}$.

the normal 3D space, it could be even smaller in spaces with reduced dimensions
for sub-systems of particles in heavy-ion reactions and/or whole neutron stars
due to constraints, collectivities and/or symmetries. We also found that the
ratio $\Psi(\rho)$ could theoretically become very large only at the
ultra-relativistic limit far above the density reachable in neutron stars. On
the other hand, nuclear interaction directly and/or indirectly through
SRC-induced high-momentum nucleons affect significantly the density dependence

affects significantly not only the kinetic energy of symmetric nuclear matter

optimal test is firstly obtained when the alphabet is finite. When the alphabet
is infinite, a tractable approximation is proposed to quantify the worst-case

We focus here on distributional and compositional time series. Applying a
square root transformation to the densities of the observations of a
distributional time series maps the distributional observations to the Hilbert
sphere, equipped with the Fisher-Rao metric. Likewise, applying a square root
transformation to the components of the observations of a compositional time
series maps the compositional observations to a finite-dimensional sphere,
equipped with the geodesic metric on spheres. The challenge in modeling such
time series lies in the intrinsic non-linearity of spheres and Hilbert spheres,
where conventional arithmetic operations such as addition or scalar
multiplication are no longer available. To address this difficulty, we consider
rotation operators to map observations on the sphere. Specifically, we
introduce a class of skew-symmetric operator such that the associated
exponential operators are rotation operators that for each given pair of points
on the sphere map one of the points to the other one. We exploit the fact that
the space of skew-symmetric operators is Hilbertian to develop autoregressive
modeling of geometric differences that correspond to rotations of spherical and
distributional time series. Motivating data for our methods include a time

in higher rank non-Archimedean, hybrid, and tame analysis. Furthermore, we
establish the convergence of the Laplace operator on metric graphs toward the
tropical Laplace operator on limit tropical curves in the corresponding moduli
spaces, leading to new perspectives in operator theory on metric graphs.
  Our result on the Arakelov Green function is inspired by the works of several
authors, in particular those of Faltings, de Jong, Wentworth and Wolpert, and
solves a long-standing open problem arising from the Arakelov geometry of
Riemann surfaces. The hybrid layered behavior close to the boundary of moduli
spaces is expected to be a broad phenomenon and will be explored in our
forthcoming work.

speakers produce novel expressions. Because of this novelty, a heavy-tail of
rare events accounts for a significant amount of the total probability mass of
distributions in language (Baayen, 2001). Standard language modeling metrics
such as perplexity quantify the performance of language models (LM) in
aggregate. As a result, we have relatively little understanding of whether
neural LMs accurately estimate the probability of sequences in this heavy-tail
of rare events. To address this gap, we develop a controlled evaluation scheme
which uses generative models trained on natural data as artificial languages
from which we can exactly compute sequence probabilities. Training LMs on
generations from these artificial languages, we compare the sequence-level
probability estimates given by LMs to the true probabilities in the target
language. Our experiments reveal that LSTM and Transformer language models (i)
systematically underestimate the probability of sequences drawn from the target
language, and (ii) do so more severely for less-probable sequences.
Investigating where this probability mass went, (iii) we find that LMs tend to
overestimate the probability of ill formed (perturbed) sequences. In addition,
we find that this underestimation behaviour (iv) is weakened, but not
eliminated by greater amounts of training data, and (v) is exacerbated for
target distributions with lower entropy.

Identification of stellar companions (both bound and unbound) has become a

assess the level of light curve dilution and the possibility of the target
being a false positive. Studies of stellar companions have also enabled
investigations into stellar multiplicity in planet-hosting systems, which has
wide-ranging implications for both exoplanet detection and characterization, as
well as for the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Speckle and AO
imaging are some of the most efficient and effective tools for revealing
close-in stellar companions; we therefore present observations of 58 M-dwarf
TOIs obtained using a suite of speckle imagers at the 3.5-m WIYN telescope, the
4.3-m Lowell Discovery Telescope, and the 8.1-m Gemini North and South

companions. Upon surveying the literature, and cross-matching our sample with

additional 15 widely-separated common proper motion companions. We also
evaluate the potential for undetected close-in companions. Taking into
consideration the sensitivity of the observations, our findings suggest that
the orbital period distribution of stellar companions to planet-hosting M
dwarfs is shifted to longer periods compared to the expected distribution for

quantum invariants of compact oriented 3-manifolds with boundary where the
boundary is a disjoint union of two identical surfaces. The invariants are
constructed via surgery on manifolds of the form $F \times I$ where $I$ denotes
the unit interval. Since virtual knots and links are represented as links in
such thickened surfaces, we are able also to construct invariants in terms of
virtual link diagrams (planar diagrams with virtual crossings).
  These invariants are new, nontrivial, and calculable examples of quantum
invariants of 3-manifolds with non-vacuous boundary.
  Since virtual knots and links are represented by embeddings of circles in
thickened surfaces, we refer to embeddings of circles in the 3-sphere as {\it
classical links}. Classical links are the same as virtual links that can be
represented in a thickened 2-sphere and it is a fact that classical links, up
to isotopy, embed in the collection of virtual links taken up to isotopy. We
give a new invariant of classical links in the 3-sphere in the following sense:
Consider a link $L$ in $S^3$ of two components. The complement of a tubular
neighborhood of $L$ is a manifold whose boundary consists in two copies of a
torus. Our invariants apply to this case of bounded manifold and give new
invariants of the given link of two components. Invariants of knots are also
obtained.
  In this paper we calculate the topological quantum invariants of some
examples explicitly. We conclude from our examples that our invariant is new
and strong enough to distinguish some classical knots from one another.
  We also explain how different Our topological quantum invariants of
3-manifolds with boundary and the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are. (See the
body for detail).

As deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely

powerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most
significant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep
learning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough
samples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the
other challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients'
private information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated
learning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices
and no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data
located on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be

radiation hard EM calorimeters, based on modular structures (RADiCAL modules)

plates, read out via radiation hard wavelength shifting (WLS) solid fiber or
capillary elements to photosensors positioned either proximately or remotely,
depending upon their radiation tolerance. The RADiCAL modules provide the

energy and timing of EM showers. This paper provides an overview of the
instrumentation and photosensor R&D associated with the RADiCAL program.

that conforms the conceptual basis for many other processes, as well as for the
modeling of time series. Here we push a fresh perspective toward white noise
that, grounded on combinatorial considerations, contributes to give new
interesting insights both for modelling and theoretical purposes. To this aim,
we incorporate the ordinal pattern analysis approach which allows us to
abstract a time series as a sequence of patterns and their associated
permutations, and introduce a simple functional over permutations that
partitions them into classes encoding their level of asymmetry. We compute the
exact probability mass function (p.m.f.) of this functional over the symmetric
group of degree $n$, thus providing the description for the case of an infinite
white noise realization. This p.m.f. can be conveniently approximated by a
continuous probability density from an exponential family, the Gaussian, hence
providing natural sufficient statistics that render a convenient and simple
statistical analysis through ordinal patterns. Such analysis is exemplified on
experimental data for the spatial increments from tracks of gold nanoparticles
in 3D diffusion.

circumvent this problem by using the formulations of nonlinear electrodynamics

with double-peaked broad emission lines (double-peaked BLAGN), in order to
check whether the NLRs sizes in type-1 AGN and type-2 AGN obey the similar
empirical dependence on \o3~ luminosity. In order to correct the inclination
effects on projected NLRs sizes of type-1 AGN, the accretion disk origin is
commonly applied to describe the double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ leading to the
determined inclination angles of central disk-like BLRs of the 38 double-peaked
BLAGN. Then, considering the fixed SDSS fiber radius, the upper limits of NLRs
sizes of the 38 double-peaked BLAGN can be estimated. Meanwhile, the strong
linear correlation between continuum luminosity and \o3~ luminosity is applied
to confirm that the \o3~ emissions of the 38 double-peaked BLAGN are totally
covered in the SDSS fibers. Considering the reddening corrected measured \o3~
luminosity, the upper limits of NLRs sizes of the 38 double-peaked BLAGN are
within the 99.9999\% confidence interval of the expected results from the
empirical relation between NLRs sizes and \o3~ luminosity in the type-2 AGN. In
the current stage, there are no clues to challenge the Unified model of AGN,

breakthroughs recently through introducing bottleneck features (BNFs) extracted
by the automatic speech recognition(ASR) model. However, selection of BNFs have
a significant impact on VC result. For example, when extracting BNFs from ASR
trained with Cross Entropy loss (CE-BNFs) and feeding into neural network to
train a VC system, the timbre similarity of converted speech is significantly
degraded. If BNFs are extracted from ASR trained using Connectionist Temporal
Classification loss (CTC-BNFs), the naturalness of the converted speech may
decrease. This phenomenon is caused by the difference of information contained
in BNFs. In this paper, we proposed an any-to-one VC method using hybrid
bottleneck features extracted from CTC-BNFs and CE-BNFs to complement each
other advantages. Gradient reversal layer and instance normalization were used
to extract prosody information from CE-BNFs and content information from
CTC-BNFs. Auto-regressive decoder and Hifi-GAN vocoder were used to generate
high-quality waveform. Experimental results show that our proposed method
achieves higher similarity, naturalness, quality than baseline method and
reveals the differences between the information contained in CE-BNFs and

seamlessly integrated into arbitrary Transformer-based VQA models to train a

the proposed BST framework with three typical Transformer-based VQA approaches,
namely MCAN [2], UNITER [3], and CLIP-ViL [4], and conduct extensive

for Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC).These methods significantly
surpass existing CNN-based ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of ViT in FGVC

FGVC.First, ViT needs to split images into patches and calculate the attention
of every pair, which may result in heavy redundant calculation and unsatisfying
performance when handling fine-grained images with complex background and small
objects.Second, a standard ViT only utilizes the class token in the final layer
for classification, which is not enough to extract comprehensive fine-grained
information. To address these issues, we propose a novel ViT based fine-grained
object discriminator for FGVC tasks, ViT-FOD for short. Specifically, besides a
ViT backbone, it further introduces three novel components, i.e, Attention
Patch Combination (APC), Critical Regions Filter (CRF), and Complementary
Tokens Integration (CTI). Thereinto, APC pieces informative patches from two
images to generate a new image so that the redundant calculation can be
reduced. CRF emphasizes tokens corresponding to discriminative regions to
generate a new class token for subtle feature learning. To extract
comprehensive information, CTI integrates complementary information captured by
class tokens in different ViT layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
widely used datasets and the results demonstrate that ViT-FOD is able to
achieve state-of-the-art performance.

their particular magnetic topology. In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive
statistical analysis of 134 CFs from 2011 September to 2017 June, including
four B-class, 82 C-class, 40 M-class, and eight X-class flares, respectively.
The flares were observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. The physical properties of CFs are
derived, including the location, area ($A_{CF}$), equivalent radius ($r_{CF}$)
assuming a semi-spherical fan dome, lifetime ($\tau_{CF}$), and peak SXR flux
in 1$-$8 {\AA}. It is found that all CFs are located in active regions, with
the latitudes between -30$^\circ$ and 30$^\circ$. The distributions of areas
and lifetimes could be fitted with a log-normal function. There is a positive
correlation between the lifetime and area. The peak SXR flux in 1$-$8 {\AA} is
well in accord with a power-law distribution with an index of $-$1.42. For the
134 CFs, 57\% of them are accompanied by remote brightenings or ribbons. A
positive correlation exists between the total length ($L_{RB}$) and average
distance ($D_{RB}$) of remote brightenings. About 47\% and 51\% of the 134 CFs
are related to type III radio bursts and jets, respectively. The association
rates are independent of flare energies. About 38\% of CFs are related to
mini-filament eruptions, and the association rates increase with flare classes.
Only 28\% of CFs are related to CMEs, meaning that a majority of them are
confined rather than eruptive events. There is a positive correlation between
the CME speed and peak SXR flux in 1$-$8 {\AA}, and faster CMEs tend to be
wider.

confirm that strong lensing effects yield 30 images of 11 background galaxies,
of which we contribute photometric redshift estimates for three image
multiplicities. These constraints enable the construction of a revised lens
model that confirms the bimodal structure, and from which we measure a mass of
M$_{600 kpc}$=(2.36$\pm$0.23)$\times$10$^{14}$M$_{\odot}$. In parallel, new
spectroscopy using MMT/Binospec and archival data contributes thirteen galaxies
which meet our velocity and transverse radius criteria for cluster membership.
The two cluster components have a pair-wise velocity of $\lessapprox$100
kms$^{-1}$, favoring an orientation in the plane of the sky with a transverse
velocity of 100-1700 kms$^{-1}$. At the same time, the brightest cluster galaxy
is offset in velocity from the systemic mean value. New LOFAR and VLA radio
maps uncover the BCG and a large red galaxy in the northeastern side to be
head-tail galaxies, suggesting that this component has already traversed
southwestern side and is now exiting the cluster to the northeast.

frames due to expensive labeling cost. We propose to conduct novel Bayesian
non-parametric submodular video partition (BN-SVP) to significantly improve MIL
model training that can offer a highly reliable solution for robust anomaly
detection in practical settings that include outlier segments or multiple types
of abnormal events. BN-SVP essentially performs dynamic non-parametric
hierarchical clustering with an enhanced self-transition that groups segments
in a video into temporally consistent and semantically coherent hidden states
that can be naturally interpreted as scenes. Each segment is assumed to be
generated through a non-parametric mixture process that allows variations of
segments within the same scenes to accommodate the dynamic and noisy nature of
many real-world surveillance videos. The scene and mixture component assignment
of BN-SVP also induces a pairwise similarity among segments, resulting in
non-parametric construction of a submodular set function. Integrating this
function with an MIL loss effectively exposes the model to a diverse set of
potentially positive instances to improve its training. A greedy algorithm is
developed to optimize the submodular function and support efficient model
training. Our theoretical analysis ensures a strong performance guarantee of
the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated over multiple real-world anomaly video datasets with robust

achieved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and thereby the
spectral efficiency of the system. Despite the vast literature available on
minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receivers, previously proposed receivers for
block fading channels do not minimize the symbol error in time-varying Rayleigh
fading channels. Specifically, we show that the true MMSE receiver structure
does not only depend on the statistics of the CSI error, but also on the
autocorrelation coefficient of the time-variant channel. It turns out that
calculating the average SINR when using the proposed receiver is highly
non-trivial. In this paper, we employ a random matrix theoretical approach,
which allows us to derive a quasi-closed form for the average SINR, which
allows to obtain analytical exact results that give valuable insights into how
the SINR depends on the number of antennas, employed pilot and data power and

matching have been widely investigated using graph neural networks - and more
recently transformer networks, they remain relatively too slow to operate in
real-time and are particularly sensitive to the poor repeatability of the
keypoints detectors. In order to address these shortcomings, we propose to
study the particular case of real-time and robust keypoints tracking.
Specifically, we propose a novel architecture which ensures a fast and robust
estimation of the keypoints tracking between successive images of a video
sequence. Our method takes advantage of a recent breakthrough in computer
vision, namely, visual transformer networks. Our method consists of two
successive stages, a coarse matching followed by a fine localization of the
keypoints' correspondences prediction. Through various experiments, we
demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results and demonstrates
high robustness against adverse conditions, such as illumination change,

applications. Prior work modifies images either from low-level manipulation,
such as image inpainting or through manual edits via paintbrushes and
scribbles, or from high-level manipulation, employing deep generative networks
to output an image conditioned on high-level semantic input. In this study, we
propose Semantic Image Manipulation with Background-guided Internal Learning
(SIMBIL), which combines high-level and low-level manipulation. Specifically,
users can edit an image at the semantic level by applying changes on a scene
graph. Then our model manipulates the image at the pixel level according to the
modified scene graph. There are two major advantages of our approach. First,
high-level manipulation of scene graphs requires less manual effort from the
user compared to manipulating raw image pixels. Second, our low-level internal
learning approach is scalable to images of various sizes without reliance on
external visual datasets for training. We outperform the state-of-the-art in a
quantitative and qualitative evaluation on the CLEVR and Visual Genome
datasets. Experiments show 8 points improvement on FID scores (CLEVR) and 27%
improvement on user evaluation (Visual Genome), demonstrating the effectiveness

response to therapy. Doing so by hand, for example as per RECIST or RANO
criteria, is tedious, time-consuming, and can miss important tumor response
information; most notably, they exclude non-target lesions. We wish to assess
change in a holistic fashion that includes all lesions, obtaining simple,
informative, and automated assessments of tumor progression or regression. Due
to often low patient enrolments in clinical trials, we wish to make response
assessments with small training sets. Deep neuroevolution (DNE) can produce
radiology artificial intelligence (AI) that performs well on small training
sets. Here we use DNE for function approximation that predicts progression
versus regression of metastatic brain disease.
  Methods: We analyzed 50 pairs of MRI contrast-enhanced images as our training
set. Half of these pairs, separated in time, qualified as disease progression,
while the other 25 images constituted regression. We trained the parameters of
a relatively small CNN via mutations that consisted of random CNN weight
adjustments and mutation fitness. We then incorporated the best mutations into
the next generations CNN, repeating this process for approximately 50,000
generations. We applied the CNNs to our training set, as well as a separate
testing set with the same class balance of 25 progression and 25 regression
images.
  Results: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy.
DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy.
  Conclusion: DNE can accurately classify brain-metastatic disease progression
versus regression. Future work will extend the input from 2D image slices to
full 3D volumes, and include the category of no change. We believe that an
approach such as our could ultimately provide a useful adjunct to RANO/RECIST

computational cost by limiting the calculation of self-attention to a local
window. Most current work uses a fixed single-scale window for modeling by
default, ignoring the impact of window size on model performance. However, this
may limit the modeling potential of these window-based models for multi-scale
information. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic Window
Vision Transformer (DW-ViT). The dynamic window strategy proposed by DW-ViT
goes beyond the model that employs a fixed single window setting. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to use dynamic multi-scale windows to
explore the upper limit of the effect of window settings on model performance.
In DW-ViT, multi-scale information is obtained by assigning windows of
different sizes to different head groups of window multi-head self-attention.
Then, the information is dynamically fused by assigning different weights to
the multi-scale window branches. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation
on three datasets, ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO. Compared with related
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, DW-ViT obtains the best performance.
Specifically, compared with the current SoTA Swin Transformers

on all three datasets with similar parameters and computational costs. In
addition, DW-ViT exhibits good scalability and can be easily inserted into any

Thevenin approach by projecting the power flow equations as circles to develop
local static-voltage stability indicator (LS-VSI) that is robust to measurement
noises. The proposed method is an attractive option for practical
implementation because of its decentralized nature, robustness to noise, and
realistic modeling. Next, we utilize LS-VSI to propose a new local dynamic -
VSI (LD-VSI) to identify the LTVI triggered by large disturbances and load tap
changer dynamics. LD-VSI can identify not only the onset of instability with an
alarm but also the voltage collapse point (VCP). Extensive numerical validation
comparing LS-VSI with existing methods is presented on IEEE 30-bus and larger
test systems like 2000-bus Texas synthetic grid to validate the robustness,
accuracy, and situational awareness feature. We also verify the LD-VSI behavior
on the Nordic power grid using PSSE dynamic simulation. When compared to

disease may be best evaluated using a sequential multiple assignment randomised
trial (SMART). A SMART is a multi-stage study that randomises a participant to
an initial treatment, observes some response to that treatment and then,
depending on their observed response, randomises the same participant to an
alternative treatment. Response adaptive randomisation may, in some settings,
improve the trial participants' outcomes and expedite trial conclusions,
compared to fixed randomisation. But 'myopic' response adaptive randomisation
strategies, blind to multistage dynamics, may also result in suboptimal
treatment assignments. We propose a 'dynamic' response adaptive randomisation
strategy based on Q-learning, an approximate dynamic programming algorithm.
Q-learning uses stage-wise statistical models and backward induction to
incorporate late-stage 'payoffs' (i.e. clinical outcomes) into early-stage
'actions' (i.e. treatments). Our real-world example consists of a COVID-19
prophylaxis and treatment SMART with qualitatively different binary endpoints
at each stage. Standard Q-learning does not work with such data because it
cannot be used for sequences of binary endpoints. Sequences of qualitatively
distinct endpoints may also require different weightings to ensure that the
design guides participants to regimens with the highest utility. We describe
how a simple decision-theoretic extension to Q-learning can be used to handle
sequential binary endpoints with distinct utilities. Using simulation we show
that, under a set of binary utilities, the 'dynamic' approach increases
expected participant utility compared to the fixed approach, sometimes
markedly, for all model parameters, whereas the 'myopic' approach can actually
decrease utility.

Consequently, applying KL control to problems with continuous spaces requires
some approximation, which leads to the lost of the optimality. To avoid such

difference between the original and reformulated KL control is that the former
measures the control effort by KL divergence between controlled and

on simple VGG-style networks. Despite the prevalence, current Rep methods
simply re-parameterize all operations into an augmented network, including
those that rarely contribute to the model's performance. As such, the price to
pay is an expensive computational overhead to manipulate these unnecessary
behaviors. To eliminate the above caveats, we aim to bootstrap the training
with minimal cost by devising a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method,
which encodes Rep technique into the training process that dynamically evolves
the network structures. Concretely, our proposal adaptively finds the
operations which contribute most to the loss in the network, and applies Rep to
enhance their representational capacity. Besides, to suppress the noisy and
redundant operations introduced by Rep, we devise a de-parameterization
technique for a more compact re-parameterization. With this regard, DyRep is
more efficient than Rep since it smoothly evolves the given network instead of
constructing an over-parameterized network. Experimental results demonstrate
our effectiveness, e.g., DyRep improves the accuracy of ResNet-18 by $2.04\%$
on ImageNet and reduces $22\%$ runtime over the baseline. Code is available at:

this model is demonstrated via comparing the numerical solutions with
measurements of the front positions, fluid velocity profile, and particle
concentration profile of lock-exchange TCs. The following physical
understandings are obtained. The vorticity field plays an important role for
the current evolution by affecting the fluid lift force (i.e., in the direction
normal to the fluid-particle slip velocity) acting on the particles. At the
very beginning, a longitudinal positive lift force due to strong positive
vorticity promotes longitudinal particle transport. Afterwards, the
longitudinal lift force decreases and eventually becomes negative, with a
magnitude that even exceeds that of the positive longitudinal drag force,
because more and more of the settling particles are affected by the negative
vorticity near the bottom wall caused by surface friction. Interestingly, in
spite of the complex behavior of the fluid-particle interaction forces and
their role in TC evolution, only a very small fraction of the initial particle
gravitational potential energy is actually transformed into TC kinetic energy
(both particle and fluid).

formulated as a non-linear least squares problem based on the estimated
correspondence field (between a rendered image and the observed image). The
problem is then solved by a differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm
enabling end-to-end training. The correspondence field estimation and pose
refinement are conducted alternatively in each iteration to recover the object
poses. Furthermore, to improve the robustness to occlusion, we introduce a
consistency-check mechanism based on the learned descriptors of the 3D model
and observed 2D images, which downweights the unreliable correspondences during
pose optimization. Extensive experiments on LINEMOD, Occlusion-LINEMOD, and
YCB-Video datasets validate the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate

kind of bipolar active particles, whose periodic bipolar self-propulsion is set
externally at a controllable frequency. We used Quincke rollers -- dielectric
particles suspended in a conducting liquid driven by an electric field -- under
an AC electric field instead of the usually used DC field. Reciprocating motion
of a single particle at the external frequency was observed experimentally and
characterized theoretically as stable periodic motion. Experimentally, we
observed not only the reciprocating motion but also non-trivial active Brownian
particle (ABP)-like persistent motion in a long time scale. This resulted in a
Lorentzian spectrum around zero frequency, which is not accounted for by a
simple extension of the conventional model of Quincke rollers to the AC field.
It was found that ABP-like motion can be reproduced by considering the
top-bottom asymmetry in the experimental system. Moreover, we found a
rotational diffusion coefficient much larger than the thermal one, as also
reported in previous experiments, which may have resulted from roughness of the
electrode surface. We also found self-organized formation of small clusters,

signals have been widely studied for various wireless sensing applications. In
many works, both received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the channel
state information (CSI) are utilized as the key factors for precise sensing.
However, the calculation and relationship between RSSI and CSI is not explained
in detail. Furthermore, there are few works focusing on the measurement
variation of the WiFi signal which impacts the sensing results. In this paper,
the relationship between RSSI and CSI is studied in detail and the measurement
variation of amplitude and phase information is investigated by extensive
experiments. In the experiments, transmitter and receiver are directly
connected by power divider and RF cables and the signal transmission is
quantitatively controlled by RF attenuators. By changing the intensity of
attenuation, the measurement of RSSI and CSI is carried out under different
conditions. From the results, it is found that in order to get a reliable
measurement of the signal amplitude and phase by commodity WiFi, the
attenuation of the channels should not exceed 60 dB. Meanwhile, the difference
between two channels should be lower than 10 dB. An active control mechanism is
suggested to ensure the measurement stability. The findings and criteria of
this work is promising to facilitate more precise sensing technologies with

However, its generalization performance to heterogeneous tasks is inferior to
other architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers) due to the extensive
retention of domain information. To address this problem, we propose a novel
frequency-aware MLP architecture, in which the domain-specific features are
filtered out in the transformed frequency domain, augmenting the invariant

filter layer, in which a learnable frequency filter is utilized to adjust the

low-rank enhancement module is further proposed to rectify the filtered
features by adding the low-frequency components from SVD decomposition.
Finally, a momentum update strategy is utilized to stabilize the optimization
to fluctuation of model parameters and inputs by the output distillation with
weighted historical states. To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose
a MLP-like backbone for domain generalization. Extensive experiments on three

the reputation structure (from what proportion of individuals in the population

gives a theoretical analysis of such complex reputation structure. We formulate
the time change of goodness of individuals caused by updates of reputations

capture the divergence of goals, i.e., goals cannot be satisfied as a whole in
some circumstances. As the goals are formally described by temporal logic,
solving BCs automatically helps engineers judge whether there is negligence in
the goal requirements. Several efforts have been devoted to computing the BCs
as well as to reducing the number of redundant BCs as well. However, the
state-of-the-art algorithms do not leverage the logic information behind the
specification and are not efficient enough for use in reality. In addition,
even though reducing redundant BCs are explored in previous work, the computed
BCs may be still not valuable to engineering for debugging. In this paper, we
start from scratch to establish the fundamental framework for the BC problem.
Based on that, we first present a new approach SyntacBC to identify BCs with

is able to achieve a >1000X speed-up than the previous state-of-the-art

propose an automata-based method for solving BCs, namely SemanticBC, which can
not only find the minimal scope of divergence, but also produce
easy-to-understand BCs without losing performance.

larger than the previous one (arXiv:2105.10717), and it is the largest

relation at optical wavelengths using this sample. This correlation is between
the rest-frame time at the end of the plateau emission, $T^{*}_{\rm opt}$, its
optical luminosity, $L_{\rm opt}$, and the peak in the optical prompt emission,
$L_{\rm peak, opt}$, thus resembling the three-dimensional (3D) X-ray
fundamental plane relation (arXiv:1604.06840). We correct our sample for
redshift evolution and selection effects, discovering that this correlation is
indeed intrinsic to GRB physics. We investigate the rest-frame end time

conclude that the plateau is achromatic only when selection biases are not

network is able to leverage the observed photometric variance and shadows on
the surface, and recover both surface shape and general non-Lambertian
reflectance. We explicitly predict cast shadows, mitigating possible artifacts
on these shadowing regions, leading to higher estimation accuracy. Our
framework is entirely self-supervised, in the sense that it requires neither
ground truth shape nor BRDF. Tests on real-world images demonstrate that our
method outperform existing methods by a significant margin. Thanks to the small
size of the MLP-net, our method is an order of magnitude faster than previous

computing, yet there are still complexity gaps that have not been bridged for
decades. In particular, in the classical message-passing setting with
processes' crashes, since the seminal works of Bar-Joseph and Ben-Or [1998]
\cite{Bar-JosephB98} and Aspnes and Waarts [1996, 1998]
\cite{AspnesW-SICOMP-96,Aspnes-JACM-98} in the previous century, there is still
a fundamental unresolved question about communication complexity of fast
randomized Consensus against a (strong) adaptive adversary crashing processes
arbitrarily online. The best known upper bound on the number of communication
bits is $\Theta(\frac{n^{3/2}}{\sqrt{\log{n}}})$ per process, while the best
lower bound is $\Omega(1)$. This is in contrast to randomized Consensus against
a (weak) oblivious adversary, for which time-almost-optimal algorithms
guarantee amortized $O(1)$ communication bits per process \cite{GK-SODA-10}. We
design an algorithm against adaptive adversary that reduces the communication
gap by nearly linear factor to $O(\sqrt{n}\cdot\text{polylog } n)$ bits per
process, while keeping almost-optimal (up to factor $O(\log^3 n)$) time
complexity $O(\sqrt{n}\cdot\log^{5/2} n)$.
  More surprisingly, we show this complexity indeed can be lowered further, but
at the expense of increasing time complexity, i.e., there is a {\em trade-off}
between communication complexity and time complexity. More specifically, our
main Consensus algorithm allows to reduce communication complexity per process
to any value from $\text{polylog } n$ to $O(\sqrt{n}\cdot\text{polylog } n)$,
as long as Time $\times$ Communication $= O(n\cdot \text{polylog } n)$.
Similarly, reducing time complexity requires more random bits per process,
i.e., Time $\times$ Randomness $=O(n\cdot \text{polylog } n)$.

correlations among their observables that are intrinsic to the physics of QSOs

different domains, e.g., image classification and audio recognition. However,
the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises concerns in the
practical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing,
especially in safety-critical scenarios. Inspired by software testing, a number
of structural coverage criteria are designed and proposed to measure the test
adequacy of DNNs. However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing
structural coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to
understand the underlying principles of these criteria. The relationship
between the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown.
Moreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation
between the structural coverage and DNN defect detection, which further posts
concerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be.
  In this paper, we propose the interpretable coverage criteria through
constructing the decision structure of a DNN. Mirroring the control flow graph
of the traditional program, we first extract a decision graph from a DNN based
on its interpretation, where a path of the decision graph represents a decision
logic of the DNN. Based on the control flow and data flow of the decision
graph, we propose two variants of path coverage to measure the adequacy of the
test cases in exercising the decision logic. The higher the path coverage, the
more diverse decision logic the DNN is expected to be explored. Our large-scale
evaluation results demonstrate that: the path in the decision graph is
effective in characterizing the decision of the DNN, and the proposed coverage
criteria are also sensitive with errors including natural errors and
adversarial examples, and strongly correlated with the output impartiality.

ineffective. To tackle such issue, we propose a plug and play module, the
Rubik's Cube Operator (RCO), to adaptively permutate the data organization of
the industrial data based tensor to an optimal or suboptimal order of
attributes before being processed by CNNs, which can be updated with subsequent
CNNs together via the gradient-based optimizer. The proposed RCO maintains K
binary and right stochastic permutation matrices to permutate attributes of K
axes of the input industrial data based tensor. A novel learning process is
proposed to enable learning permutation matrices from data, where the
Gumbel-Softmax is employed to reparameterize elements of permutation matrices,

These advances
rely on the simple design principle of arranging meta-atoms in regular arrays
to create an arbitrary phase and polarization profile. Unfortunately, the
concept of equally spaced meta-atoms reaches its limit for high deflection
angles where the deflection efficiency decreases. The efficiency can be
increased using nano-antennas with multiple elements, but their polarization
sensitivity hinders their application in metalenses. Here, we show that by
designing polarization-insensitive dimer nano-antennas and abandoning the
principle of equally spaced unit cells, polarization-independent ultrahigh
numerical aperture (NA=1.48) oil-immersion operation with an efficiency of 43%
can be demonstrated. This represents a significant improvement on other
polarization-independent designs at visible wavelength. We also use this single
layer metalens to replace a conventional objective lens and demonstrate the
confocal scanning microscopic imaging of a grating with a period of 300 nm at
532 nm operating wavelength. Overall, our results experimentally demonstrate a
novel design concept that further improves metalens performance.

This strategy enables us to extract a smooth volume effect as well as
volume-independent provider effects. These two quantities can be compared
directly in terms of their magnitude, which gives insight into the sources of
variability of quality of care. Based on a causal DAG, we derive conditions
under which the volume-effect can be interpreted as a causal effect. The paper
provides confidence sets for each of the estimated quantities relying on joint

the model to create more discrepant sub-centers while saving memory and cutting
computational costs considerably. The F-SC specifically, first samples a class
center Ui for each class from a uniform distribution, and then generates a
normal distribution for each class, where the mean is equal to Ui. Finally, the
sub-centers are sampled based on the normal distribution corresponding to each
class, and the sub-centers are fixed during the training process avoiding the
overhead of gradient calculation. Moreover, F-SC penalizes the Euclidean
distance between the samples and their corresponding sub-centers, it helps
remain intra-compactness. The experimental results show that F-SC significantly
improves the accuracy of both image classification and fine-grained recognition
tasks.

measurement under pressure. T_chimax decreases with increasing pressure and
disappears at the critical pressure Pc = 1.7 GPa, above which superconductivity
is destroyed. This tendency is also observed in the temperature dependence of
the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1. At low pressures, 1/T1 shows a
conventional Fermi-liquid behavior (1/T1T = constant) at low temperatures,
indicating the formation of the heavy-fermion state. Above Pc, 1/T1T follows a
1/T behavior without any crossover to the heavy-fermion state down to the
lowest temperature (~3 K). In addition, the NMR signals disappear below 3~K,
due to the influence of the magnetically ordered moments. From the pressure
dependence of the T_chimax and Knight shift, it was found that the Fermi
surface character is abruptly changed at Pc, and that superconductivity is

comparable to CNNs methods in computer vision. This review mainly investigates
the current research progress of Transformer in image and video applications,
which makes a comprehensive overview of Transformer in visual learning
understanding. First, the attention mechanism is reviewed, which plays an
essential part in Transformer. And then, the visual Transformer model and the
principle of each module are introduced. Thirdly, the existing
Transformer-based models are investigated, and their performance is compared in
visual learning understanding applications. Three image tasks and two video
tasks of computer vision are investigated. The former mainly includes image
classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The latter contains
object tracking and video classification. It is significant for comparing
different models' performance in various tasks on several public benchmark data
sets. Finally, ten general problems are summarized, and the developing
prospects of the visual Transformer are given in this review.

integrates the (possibly noisy and sporadic) agents' feedback to learn the
pseudo-gradients of the agents, and then design personalized incentives for

have similar embeddings -- have shown great power in knowledge graph embeddings
(KGE). Many existing semantic matching models use inner products in embedding
spaces to measure the plausibility of triples and quadruples in static and
temporal knowledge graphs. However, vectors that have the same inner products
with another vector can still be orthogonal to each other, which implies that
entities with similar semantics may have dissimilar embeddings. This property
of inner products significantly limits the performance of semantic matching
models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel regularizer -- namely,
DUality-induced RegulArizer (DURA) -- which effectively encourages the entities
with similar semantics to have similar embeddings. The major novelty of DURA is
based on the observation that, for an existing semantic matching KGE model
(primal), there is often another distance based KGE model (dual) closely
associated with it, which can be used as effective constraints for entity
embeddings. Experiments demonstrate that DURA consistently and significantly
improves the performance of state-of-the-art semantic matching models on both

transient heat conduction phenomenon proving the existence and uniqueness of
hydrodynamic phonon transport in three-dimensional materials was found, namely,
using a heating laser pulse to heat the materials under the environment

\begin{equation*} X_{\np}=-y(1-x)\partial_x+(x+Dx^2+Fy^2)\partial_y,

$\Sc^2$, the boundary of the period annulus has two connected components, the
center itself and a polycycle. We call them the inner and outer boundary of the
period annulus, respectively. We are interested in the bifurcation of critical
periodic orbits from the polycycle $\out_\np$ at the outer boundary. A critical
period is an isolated critical point of the period function. The criticality of
the period function at the outer boundary is the maximal number of critical
periodic orbits of $X_\np$ that tend to $\out_{\np_0}$ in the Hausdorff sense
as $\np\to\np_0.$ This notion is akin to the cyclicity in Hilbert's 16th
Problem. Our main result (Theorem A) shows that the criticality at the outer
boundary is at most 2 for all $\np=(D,F)\in\R^2$ outside the segments
$\{-1\}\times [0,1]$ and $\{0\}\times [0,2]$. With regard to the bifurcation
from the inner boundary, Chicone and Jacobs proved in their seminal paper on
the issue that the upper bound is 2 for all $\np\in\R^2.$ In this paper the
techniques are different because, while the period function extends
analytically to the center, it has no smooth extension to the polycycle. We
show that the period function has an asymptotic expansion near the polycycle
with the remainder being uniformly flat with respect to~$\np$ and where the
principal part is given in a monomial scale containing a deformation of the
logarithm. More precisely, Theorem~A follows by obtaining the asymptotic
expansion to fourth order and computing its coefficients, which are not
polynomial in~$\np$ but transcendental.

functions, and 3D wall and equilibria, including the plasma response to the
externally applied 3D fields calculated with MARS-F, have been employed. The
observed total fast-ion losses depend on the poloidal spectra of the applied
n=3 RMP as well as on the absolute toroidal phase of the applied perturbation
with respect to the NBI birth distribution. The absolute toroidal phase of the
RMP perturbation does not affect the ELM control capabilities, which makes it a
key parameter in the confinement optimization. The physics mechanisms
underlying the observed fast-ion losses induced by the applied 3D fields have
been studied in terms of the variation of the particle canonical angular
momentum ($\delta P_{\phi}$) induced by the applied 3D fields. The presented
simulations indicate that the transport is located in an Edge Resonant
Transport Layer (ERTL) as observed previously in ASDEX Upgrade studies.
Similarly, our results indicate that an overlapping of several linear and
nonlinear resonances at the edge of the plasma might be responsible for the
observed fast-ion losses. The results presented here may help to optimize the
RMP configuration with respect to the NBI confinement in future ITER
discharges.

allow for robotics and artificial intelligence to adapt and repurpose at pace,

within robotics to secure an effective partnership in a wide range of areas
which include shared workspaces and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS).
Robotic manipulation abilities have improved a robots accessibility via the
ability to open doorways, however, challenges exist in how a robot decides if
it is safe to move into a new workspace. Current sensing methods are limited to
line of sight and are unable to capture data beyond doorways or walls,
therefore, a robot is unable to sense if it is safe to open a door. Another
limitation exists as robots are unable to detect if a human is within a shared
workspace. Therefore, if a human is detected, extended safety precautions can
be taken to ensure the safe autonomous operation of a robot. These challenges
are represented as safety, trust and resilience, inhibiting the successful
advancement of CPS. This paper evaluates the use of frequency modulated
continuous wave radar sensing for human detection and through-wall detection to
increase situational awareness. The results validate the use of the sensor to
detect the difference between a person and infrastructure, and increased
situational awareness for navigation via foresight monitoring through walls.

with the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, have been performed to
investigate the strain- and temperature-induced tunability of the
thermoelectric properties of monolayer (ML) MoS$_2$. The electronic band gap
reduces with increasing tensile strain, and a semiconductor to metal transition
occurs for $10\%$ biaxial strain. Tensile strains, in most of the cases, are
seen to have a diminishing effect on the thermopower and power factor of
monolayer MoS$_2$, with larger impact on the p-type carriers. Performing
anharmonic phonon calculations, it is seen that tensile strain, in general and
uniaxial tensile strain along the zig-zag direction, in particular,
significantly reduces the thermal conductivity of ML-MoS$_2$. The combined
effect of reduced phonon relaxation time, ZA-optical phonon frequency gap and
the Debye temperature is found to be the driving force behind the lowering of
the thermal conductivity. The large reduction in thermal conductivity and
increase in power factor under the action of tensile strains along the zigzag
direction act in concert to result in an enhanced efficiency and hence,
improved thermoelectric performance. The thermoelectric efficiency of
ML-MoS$_2$ is seen to increase with increasing temperature, suggesting its use
as a high-temperature thermoelectric material. Nearly 75\% enhancement in the
thermoelectric efficiency can be achieved with optimal doping concentration.
We, therefore, highlight the significance of in-plane tensile strains in
improving the thermoelectric performance of ML-MoS$_2$, which could open
avenues for its application in emerging areas in 2D-thermoelectrics.

This contributes to a convention for aligning all data to a global average

this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning-based framework that
converts registration to a multi-label classification problem, where each point

architecture, in an end-to-end unsupervised way, with regularization imposed
using a deep Conditional Random Field (CRF). Experiments show that our proposed

an unseen target domain by using the knowledge of multiple seen source domains.
Mainstream DG methods typically assume that the domain label of each source
sample is known a priori, which is challenged to be satisfied in many
real-world applications. In this paper, we study a practical problem of
compound DG, which relaxes the discrete domain assumption to the mixed source
domains setting. On the other hand, current DG algorithms prioritize the focus
on semantic invariance across domains (one-vs-one), while paying less attention
to the holistic semantic structure (many-vs-many). Such holistic semantic
structure, referred to as meta-knowledge here, is crucial for learning
generalizable representations. To this end, we present Compound Domain
Generalization via Meta-Knowledge Encoding (COMEN), a general approach to
automatically discover and model latent domains in two steps. Firstly, we
introduce Style-induced Domain-specific Normalization (SDNorm) to re-normalize
the multi-modal underlying distributions, thereby dividing the mixture of
source domains into latent clusters. Secondly, we harness the prototype
representations, the centroids of classes, to perform relational modeling in
the embedding space with two parallel and complementary modules, which
explicitly encode the semantic structure for the out-of-distribution
generalization. Experiments on four standard DG benchmarks reveal that COMEN
exceeds the state-of-the-art performance without the need of domain
supervision.

significant progress in the numerical implementation of pffRG, allowing one to
track the evolution of pseudofermion vertices under the renormalization group

more. To lend confidence in the numerical robustness of state-of-the-art

tackle unconventional forms of quantum magnetism.

  Denoising by Disentangling Noise from Image","Published at CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, significant progress has been made on image denoising with strong
supervision from large-scale datasets. However, obtaining well-aligned
noisy-clean training image pairs for each specific scenario is complicated and
costly in practice. Consequently, applying a conventional supervised denoising
network on in-the-wild noisy inputs is not straightforward. Although several
studies have challenged this problem without strong supervision, they rely on
less practical assumptions and cannot be applied to practical situations
directly. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel and
powerful self-supervised denoising method called CVF-SID based on a Cyclic
multi-Variate Function (CVF) module and a self-supervised image disentangling
(SID) framework. The CVF module can output multiple decomposed variables of the
input and take a combination of the outputs back as an input in a cyclic
manner. Our CVF-SID can disentangle a clean image and noise maps from the input
by leveraging various self-supervised loss terms. Unlike several methods that
only consider the signal-independent noise models, we also deal with
signal-dependent noise components for real-world applications. Furthermore, we
do not rely on any prior assumptions about the underlying noise distribution,
making CVF-SID more generalizable toward realistic noise. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets show that CVF-SID achieves state-of-the-art
self-supervised image denoising performance and is comparable to other existing
approaches. The code is publicly available from

scattering (VVCS) off the deuteron and the closely related two-photon-exchange

deuteron VVCS amplitude is calculated in the framework of pionless effective
field theory, up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) for the
longitudinal and next-to-leading order (NLO) for the transverse amplitude. The
charge elastic form factor of the deuteron, obtained from the residue of the
longitudinal VVCS amplitude, is used to extract the value of the single unknown
two-nucleon one-photon contact coupling that enters the longitudinal amplitude
at N3LO. The obtained deuteron VVCS amplitude serves as a high-precision
model-independent input to examine the $2\gamma$-exchange corrections.
Substantial differences with the recent dispersive evaluations are identified,
namely, the elastic contribution appears to be larger by several standard
deviations, thus ameliorating the current discrepancy between theory and
experiment on the size of $2\gamma$-exchange effects. A correlation between the
values of the deuteron charge and Friar radii is found that can be used to
judge on the quality of a parametrisation of the deuteron charge elastic form
factor. The discrepancy between the theory and the empirical result for the
$2\gamma$-exchange correction in muonic deuterium appears to be completely
eliminated. To further confirm this, we revisit the hydrogen-deuterium isotope
shift in the same framework. Our work provides an alternative self-consistent
and high-precision evaluation of the $2\gamma$-exchange correction in (muonic)

orbitals defined as eigenvectors of the truncated single-particle density
matrix. This method provides well-converged many-body wave functions on
lattices with up to tens of thousands of sites, bypassing some limitations of
other approaches. The algorithm is put to the test by investigating the charge
screening cloud around an interacting resonant level, both on clean and
disordered lattices, achieving accurate spatial resolution from short to long
distances. We thus demonstrate strong anisotropy of spatial correlations around
an adatom in the half-filled square lattice. Taking advantage of the efficiency
of the algorithm, we further compute the disorder-induced distribution of Kondo
temperatures over several thousands of random realizations, at the same time
gaining access to the full spatial profile of the screening cloud in each
sample. While the charge screening cloud is typically shortened due to the
polarization of the impurity by the disorder potential, we surprisingly find
that rare disorder configurations preserve the long range nature of Kondo
correlations in the electronic bath.

diversity of natural language descriptions, temporal grounding allows activity
grounding beyond pre-defined classes and has received increasing attention in
recent years. The semantic diversity is rooted in the principle of
compositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be systematically
described by combining known words in novel ways (compositional
generalization). However, current temporal grounding datasets do not
specifically test for the compositional generalizability. To systematically
measure the compositional generalizability of temporal grounding models, we
introduce a new Compositional Temporal Grounding task and construct two new
dataset splits, i.e., Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG. Evaluating the
state-of-the-art methods on our new dataset splits, we empirically find that
they fail to generalize to queries with novel combinations of seen words. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a variational cross-graph reasoning framework
that explicitly decomposes video and language into multiple structured
hierarchies and learns fine-grained semantic correspondence among them.
Experiments illustrate the superior compositional generalizability of our
approach. The repository of this work is at https://github.com/YYJMJC/

However, open-ended evolution research is hampered by two fundamental issues;
the struggle to replicate open-endedness in an artificial evolutionary system,
and the fact that we only have one system (genetic evolution) from which to

the unique qualities seen in cultural evolution provide us with a new

Here we provide an overview of culture as an evolutionary system, highlight the
interesting case of human cultural evolution as an open-ended evolutionary
system, and contextualise cultural evolution under the framework of (evolved)
open-ended evolution. We go on to provide a set of new questions that can be

of our lives. They are required to operate under rigorous practical constraints
in terms of service latency, network bandwidth overheads, and also privacy. Yet
current implementations running in the Cloud are unable to satisfy all these
constraints. The Edge-Cloud Collaborative Intelligence (ECCI) paradigm has
become a popular approach to address such issues, and rapidly increasing
applications are developed and deployed. However, these prototypical
implementations are developer-dependent and scenario-specific without
generality, which cannot be efficiently applied in large-scale or to general
ECC scenarios in practice, due to the lack of supports for infrastructure
management, edge-cloud collaborative service, complex intelligence workload,
and efficient performance optimization. In this article, we systematically
design and construct the first unified platform, ACE, that handles
ever-increasing edge and cloud resources, user-transparent services, and
proliferating intelligence workloads with increasing scale and complexity, to
facilitate cost-efficient and high-performing ECCI application development and
deployment. For verification, we explicitly present the construction process of
an ACE-based intelligent video query application, and demonstrate how to
achieve customizable performance optimization efficiently. Based on our initial
experience, we discuss both the limitations and vision of ACE to shed light on
promising issues to elaborate in the approaching ECCI ecosystem.

connection with the second quantization of the particle in the same background.
It turns out that the proper way to define the light-cone quantization is to
require that the constant light-cone time hypersurface is null or,
equivalently, that the particle Hamiltonian is free of square roots. Moreover,
in order to quantize the scalar theory it is necessary to use not the original
scalar rather a scalar field density, i.e. the Schr\""odinger wave functional
depends on a scalar density and not on the original field. Finally we recover
this result as the second quantization of a particle on the same background,
where it is necessary to add as input the fact that we are dealing with a

confounding. Options include propensity score methods and regression. It
remains unclear how dataset characteristics (size, overlap in propensity
scores, exposure prevalence) influence the relative performance of the methods,
making it difficult to select the best method for a particular dataset.
  A simulation study to evaluate the role of dataset characteristics on the
performance of propensity score methods, compared to logistic regression, for
estimating a marginal odds ratio in the presence of confounding was conducted.
Outcomes were simulated from logistic and complementary log-log models, and
size, overlap in propensity scores, and prevalence of the exposure were varied.
  Regression showed poor coverage for small sample sizes, but with large sample
sizes it was more robust to imbalance in propensity scores and low exposure
prevalence than were propensity score methods. Propensity score methods
frequently displayed suboptimal coverage, particularly as overlap in propensity
scores decreased. These problems were exacerbated at larger sample sizes. Power
of matching methods was particularly affected by lack of overlap, low
prevalence of exposure, and small sample size. Performance of inverse
probability of treatment weighting depended heavily on dataset characteristics,
with poor coverage and bias with low overlap. The advantage of regression for
large data size was less clear in sensitivity analysis with a complementary
log-log outcome generation mechanism and unmeasured confounding, with superior
bias and error but lower coverage than nearest neighbour and caliper matching.

equations and conservative phase field equation for interface capturing are
first transformed into the exterior calculus framework. The discrete counter
part of these smooth equations is obtained by substituting with discrete
differential forms and discrete exterior operators. We prove the boundedness of
the method for the first order Euler forward and predictor-corrector time

any ad hoc mass redistribution. We verify the scheme against several standard
test cases (for interface capturing) comprising not only the flat domains but
also the curved domains, leveraging the advantage that DEC operators are
independent of the coordinate system. The results show excellent properties of
boundedness, mass conservation and convergence. Moreover, we demonstrate the

a novel objective which yields both an outer and an inner approximation while
minimizing the ratio of their respective volumes. This objective is
scale-invariant and easily interpreted. Numerical examples are given which show
that the approximations obtained are often tighter than those returned by

of wormholes to the gravitational path integral and the phenomenon of replica
symmetry breaking observed in spin glasses and other disordered systems.
Interestingly, these configurations may also be important for the explanation
of the information paradox of quantum black holes. Motivated by these
developments, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of a $PT$-symmetric
system composed of two random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with no explicit
coupling between them. After performing ensemble averaging, we identify
numerically and analytically a robust first-order phase transition in the free
energy of two models with quantum chaotic dynamics: the elliptic Ginibre
ensemble of random matrices and a non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.
The free energy of the Ginibre model is temperature-independent in the
low-temperature phase. The SYK model has a similar behavior for sufficiently
low temperature, then it experiences a possible continuous phase transition to
a phase with a temperature-dependent free energy before the first-order
transition takes place at a higher temperature. We identify the order parameter
of the first-order phase transition and obtain analytical expressions for the
critical temperature. The mechanism behind the transition is the existence of
replica symmetry breaking configurations coupling Left and Right replicas that
control the low-temperature limit of the partition function. We speculate that
quantum chaos may be necessary for the observed dominance of off-diagonal
replica symmetry breaking configurations in the low-temperature limit.

area of behavior trees in robotics. The key idea underlying behavior trees is
to make use of modularity, hierarchies and feedback, in order to handle the
complexity of a versatile robot control system. Modularity is a well-known tool
to handle software complexity by enabling development, debugging and extension
of separate modules without having detailed knowledge of the entire system. A
hierarchy of such modules is natural, since robot tasks can often be decomposed
into a hierarchy of sub-tasks. Finally, feedback control is a fundamental tool
for handling uncertainties and disturbances in any low level control system,
but in order to enable feedback control on the higher level, where one module
decides what submodule to execute, information regarding progress and
applicability of each submodule needs to be shared in the module interfaces. We
will describe how these three concepts come to use in theoretical analysis,
practical design, as well as extensions and combinations with other ideas from
control theory and robotics.

  Models",,,,,"cs.LG cs.PF math.ST stat.ME stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Novel prediction methods should always be compared to a baseline to know how
well they perform. Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a
model is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an
$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the
`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art
model is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly
when newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy
classifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,
making the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline
method for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This
approach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as
a baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used
evaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)
always predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)
general, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,
as it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)
informative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD
baseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research
papers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity
check during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major
warning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline.

Local Asynchronous SGD (LASGD), an asynchronous decentralized algorithm that

in effectiveness, while often sacrificing the efficiency and interpretability
of the neural model compared to classical approaches. This paper proposes
ColBERTer, a neural retrieval model using contextualized late interaction
(ColBERT) with enhanced reduction. Along the effectiveness Pareto frontier,
ColBERTer's reductions dramatically lower ColBERT's storage requirements while
simultaneously improving the interpretability of its token-matching scores. To
this end, ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and
optional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector
component, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by
learning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and
learning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to
effective scoring. We employ an explicit multi-task, multi-stage training to
facilitate using very small vector dimensions. Results on the MS MARCO and
TREC-DL collection show that ColBERTer can reduce the storage footprint by up
to 2.5x, while maintaining effectiveness. With just one dimension per token in
its smallest setting, ColBERTer achieves index storage parity with the
plaintext size, with very strong effectiveness results. Finally, we demonstrate
ColBERTer's robustness on seven high-quality out-of-domain collections,
yielding statistically significant gains over traditional retrieval baselines.

learning. Point cloud, the most important data format for 3D environmental
perception, is naturally endowed with strong radial symmetry. In this work, we
exploit this radial symmetry via a divide-and-conquer strategy to boost 3D
perception performance and ease optimization. We propose Azimuth Normalization
(AziNorm), which normalizes the point clouds along the radial direction and
eliminates the variability brought by the difference of azimuth. AziNorm can be
flexibly incorporated into most LiDAR-based perception methods. To validate its
effectiveness and generalization ability, we apply AziNorm in both object
detection and semantic segmentation. For detection, we integrate AziNorm into
two representative detection methods, the one-stage SECOND detector and the
state-of-the-art two-stage PV-RCNN detector. Experiments on Waymo Open Dataset
demonstrate that AziNorm improves SECOND and PV-RCNN by 7.03 mAPH and 3.01 mAPH
respectively. For segmentation, we integrate AziNorm into KPConv. On
SemanticKitti dataset, AziNorm improves KPConv by 1.6/1.1 mIoU on val/test set.
Besides, AziNorm remarkably improves data efficiency and accelerates
convergence, reducing the requirement of data amounts or training epochs by an
order of magnitude. SECOND w/ AziNorm can significantly outperform fully
trained vanilla SECOND, even trained with only 10% data or 10% epochs. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/hustvl/AziNorm.

expensive to sample, pseudorandom ensembles in the form of t-designs are
frequently used as an efficient substitute, and are sufficient for most
applications. We investigate t-designs generated using a measurement-based
approach on superconducting quantum computers. In particular, we implemented an
exact single-qubit 3-design on IBM quantum processors by performing
measurements on a 6-qubit graph state. By analysing channel tomography results,
we were able to show that the ensemble of unitaries realised was a 1-design,
but not a 2-design or a 3-design under the test conditions set, which we show
to be a result of depolarising noise during the measurement-based process. We
obtained improved results for the 2-design test by implementing an approximate
2-design, in which measurements were performed on a smaller 5-qubit graph
state, but the test still did not pass for all states. This suggests that the
practical realisation of measurement-based t-designs on superconducting quantum
computers will require further work on the reduction of depolarising noise in
these devices.

selected for the workshops are aspects of 6G that we expect will have a
significant impact on other industries and on society:
  - 6G as both a communication infrastructure and a sensing infrastructure
  - The extensive use of artificial intelligence in 6G
  - The security and resilience of 6G

implement 6G. Rather, it provides input from experts from both the wireless
industry as well as from other sectors about (mostly) non-technical topics that
will need to be addressed in parallel with the technical developments, such as
new use cases, regulation, communication with the public, and cross-industry
cooperation.
  We have identified six areas that will have a significant impact on the
development and use of 6G, and that organizations must consider as they begin
their plans and designs for 6G. Based on these six impact areas and on the
discussion in the workshops, we compiled a list of the top 10 recommendations
for specific areas where organizations should place their focus when developing
their strategic plan for 6G. In addition, for our readers who are involved in
6G research, be it at a university, at a research institute or in industrial

only addressed half the problem of maintaining cores, the problem of

Known as a growingly popular method, latent space manipulation performs face
editing by changing the latent code of an input face to liberate users from
painting skills. However, previous latent space manipulation methods usually
encode an entire face into a single low-dimensional embedding, which constrains
the reconstruction capacity and the control flexibility of facial components,
such as eyes and nose. This paper proposes IA-FaceS as a bidirectional method
for disentangled face attribute manipulation as well as flexible, controllable
component editing without the need for segmentation masks or sketches in the
original image. To strike a balance between the reconstruction capacity and the
control flexibility, the encoder is designed as a multi-head structure to yield
embeddings for reconstruction and control, respectively: a high-dimensional
tensor with spatial properties for consistent reconstruction and four
low-dimensional facial component embeddings for semantic face editing.
Manipulating the separate component embeddings can help achieve disentangled
attribute manipulation and flexible control of facial components. To further
disentangle the highly-correlated components, a component adaptive modulation
(CAM) module is proposed for the decoder. The semantic single-eye editing is
developed for the first time without any input visual guidance, such as
segmentation masks or sketches. According to the experimental results, IA-FaceS
establishes a good balance between maintaining image details and performing
flexible face manipulation. Both quantitative and qualitative results indicate
that the proposed method outperforms the other techniques in reconstruction,
face attribute manipulation, and component transfer.

pressure at the limit: a ghost effect is discussed and confronted to the

  Incremental Learning","Accepted to ECCV 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) struggles with catastrophic forgetting when
learning new knowledge, and Data-Free CIL (DFCIL) is even more challenging
without access to the training data of previously learned classes. Though
recent DFCIL works introduce techniques such as model inversion to synthesize
data for previous classes, they fail to overcome forgetting due to the severe
domain gap between the synthetic and real data. To address this issue, this
paper proposes relation-guided representation learning (RRL) for DFCIL, dubbed
R-DFCIL. In RRL, we introduce relational knowledge distillation to flexibly
transfer the structural relation of new data from the old model to the current
model. Our RRL-boosted DFCIL can guide the current model to learn
representations of new classes better compatible with representations of
previous classes, which greatly reduces forgetting while improving plasticity.
To avoid the mutual interference between representation and classifier
learning, we employ local rather than global classification loss during RRL.
After RRL, the classification head is refined with global class-balanced
classification loss to address the data imbalance issue as well as learn the
decision boundaries between new and previous classes. Extensive experiments on
CIFAR100, Tiny-ImageNet200, and ImageNet100 demonstrate that our R-DFCIL
significantly surpasses previous approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance for DFCIL. Code is available at

measurements (CMs) to estimate accurate positions even in multipath propagation

convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract the spatial information.
However, they need spatially dense data sets (associated with high acquisition
and maintenance efforts) to work well -- which is rarely the case in practical
applications. If such data is not available (or its quality is low), we cannot
compensate the performance degradation of CNN-based FP as they do not provide
statistical position estimates, which prevents a fusion with other sources of
information on the observation level.
  We propose a novel localization framework that adapts well to sparse datasets
that only contain CMs of specific areas within the environment with strong
multipath propagation. Our framework compresses CMs into informative features
to unravel spatial information. It then regresses Gaussian processes (GPs) for
each of them, which imply statistical observation models based on
distance-dependent covariance kernels. Our framework combines the trained GPs
with line-of-sight ranges and a dynamics model in a particle filter. Our
measurements show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art CNN

signs of multiple feedback channels of SNRs on nearby molecular clouds (MCs).
We found very broad HCO+ lines with widths of dv = 48--75 km/s in the SNR
southwest, providing strong evidence that W49B is perturbing MCs at a systemic
velocity of $V_{LSR}=61$--65 km/s, and placing W49B at a distance of $7.9\pm
0.6$ kpc. We observed unusually high-intensity ratios of HCO+ J=1-0/CO J=1-0
not only at shocked regions ($1.1\pm 0.4$ and $0.70\pm 0.16$), but also in
quiescent clouds over 1 pc away from the SNR's eastern boundary (> 0.2). By
comparing with the magnetohydrodynamics shock models, we interpret that the
high ratio in the broad-line regions can result from a cosmic-ray (CR) induced
chemistry in shocked MCs, where the CR ionization rate is enhanced to around
10--100 times of the Galactic level. The high HCO+/CO ratio outside the SNR is
probably caused by the radiation precursor, while the luminous X-ray emission
of W49B can explain a few properties in this region. The above results provide
observational evidence that SNRs can strongly influence the molecular chemistry
in and outside the shock boundary via their shocks, CRs, and radiation. We
propose that the HCO+/CO ratio is a potentially useful tool to probe an SNR's
multichannel influence on MCs.

platforms like semiconductor spin qubits and trapped-ion qubits. The looped
pipeline architecture has similar hardware requirements to other shuttling
approaches, but can process a stack of qubit arrays instead of just one. Even a
stack of limited height is enabling for diverse schemes ranging from NISQ-era
error mitigation through to fault-tolerant codes. For the former, protocols
involving multiple states can be implemented with a space-time resource cost
comparable to preparing one noisy copy. For the latter, one can realise a far
broader variety of code structures; as an example we consider layered 2D codes
within which transversal CNOTs are available. Under reasonable assumptions this
approach can reduce the space-time cost of magic state distillation by two
orders of magnitude. Numerical modelling using experimentally-motivated noise
models verifies that the architecture provides this benefit without significant

critical free fermions. These models can be parameterized by a complex function
which has zeros on the unit circle. When the zeros on the unit circle do not
have degeneracy and there is no zero outside of the unit circle we are able to
classify the coefficient of the logarithm. In particular, we numerically
calculate the R\'enyi (Shannon) entropy in configuration basis for wide variety
of these models and show that there are two distinct classes. For systems with
$U(1)$ symmetry the coefficient is proportional to the central charge, i.e. one
half of the number of points that one can linearize the dispersion relation of
the system; for all the values of $\alpha$ with transition point at $\alpha=4$.
For systems without this symmetry, when $\alpha>1$ this coefficient is again
proportional to the central charge. However, the coefficient for $\alpha\leq 1$
is a new universal number. Finally, by using the discrete version of
Bisognano-Wichmann modular Hamiltonian of the Ising chain we show that these
coefficients are universal and dependent on the underlying CFT.

  receptor dynamics","20 pages, 9 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The lateral diffusion and trapping of neurotransmitter receptors within the
postsynaptic membrane of a neuron plays a key role in determining synaptic
strength and plasticity. Trapping is mediated by the reversible binding of
receptors to scaffolding proteins (slots) within a synapse. In this paper we
introduce a new method for analyzing the transient dynamics of synapses in a
diffusion-trapping model of receptor trafficking. Given a population of
spatially distributed synapses, each of which has a fixed number of slots, we
calculate the rate of relaxation to the steady-state distribution of bound
slots (synaptic weights) in terms of a set of local accumulation times.
Assuming that the rates of exocytosis and endocytosis are sufficiently slow, we
show that the steady-state synaptic weights are independent of each other
(purely local). On the other hand, the local accumulation time of a given
synapse depends on the number of slots and the spatial location of all the
synapses, indicating a form of transient heterosynaptic plasticity. This
suggests that local accumulation time measurements could provide useful
information regarding the distribution of synaptic weights within a dendrite.

clients express thoughts and feelings, and change behavior. In particular, how
well therapists convey empathy is an essential quality index of psychotherapy
sessions and is associated with psychotherapy outcome. In this paper, we
analyze the prosody of therapist speech and attempt to associate the
therapist's speaking style with subjectively perceived empathy. An automatic
speech and text processing system is developed to segment long recordings of
psychotherapy sessions into pause-delimited utterances with text
transcriptions. Data-driven clustering is applied to the utterances from
different therapists in multiple sessions. For each cluster, a typological
representation of utterance genre is derived based on quantized prosodic
feature parameters. Prominent speaking styles of the therapist can be observed
and interpreted from salient utterance genres that are correlated with empathy.
Using the salient utterance genres, an accuracy of $71\%$ is achieved in
classifying psychotherapy sessions into ``high"" and ``low"" empathy level.
Analysis of results suggests that empathy level tends to be (1) low if
therapists speak long utterances slowly or speak short utterances quickly; and
(2) high if therapists talk to clients with a steady tone and volume.

machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry
researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase
exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution
characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both
the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis and optimization
of job / resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC
domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum
computing. This paper proposes optimized adaptive job scheduling to the quantum
cloud taking note of primary characteristics such as queuing times and fidelity
trends across machines, as well as other characteristics such as quality of
service guarantees and machine calibration constraints. Key components of the
proposal include a) a prediction model which predicts fidelity trends across
machine based on compiled circuit features such as circuit depth and different
forms of errors, as well as b) queuing time prediction for each machine based
on execution time estimations. Overall, this proposal is evaluated on simulated
IBM machines across a diverse set of quantum applications and system loading
scenarios, and is able to reduce wait times by over 3x and improve fidelity by
over 40\% on specific usecases, when compared to traditional job schedulers.

quantum barriers with varying dimensions reduced from 20 nm to 5nm to observe
how tunneling properties are affected by scaling. The effective electron masses
in the well and barrier regions typically vary with constituent materials. It
has been shown that the transmission coefficients are significantly changed due
to the coupling. The effective mass-dependent transmission coefficients for
electron energy have been evaluated in terms of the mass discontinuity metrics.
The electron transmission coefficients for each pair of quantum structures are
plotted with the variation of its electron energy, normalized to its potential

decisions impacting people's lives. However, they have been found to exhibit
severe erroneous behaviors that may lead to unfortunate outcomes. Previous work
shows that such misbehaviors often occur due to class property violations
rather than errors on a single image. Although methods for detecting such
errors have been proposed, fixing them has not been studied so far. Here, we
propose a generic method called Weighted Regularization (WR) consisting of five
concrete methods targeting the error-producing classes to fix the DNNs. In
particular, it can repair confusion error and bias error of DNN models for both
single-label and multi-label image classifications. A confusion error happens
when a given DNN model tends to confuse between two classes. Each method in WR
assigns more weights at a stage of DNN retraining or inference to mitigate the
confusion between target pair. A bias error can be fixed similarly. We evaluate
and compare the proposed methods along with baselines on six widely-used
datasets and architecture combinations. The results suggest that WR methods
have different trade-offs but under each setting at least one WR method can
greatly reduce confusion/bias errors at a very limited cost of the overall
performance.

in the control group play the game without receiving any assistance, while in
treatment groups they are assisted by a DSS suggesting places to drill. For
certain treatments, the DSS does not consider costs, but only rewards, which
introduces a bias that is observable by users. Between subjects, we vary the
accuracy and bias of the DSS, and observe the participants' total score, time
to completion, the extent to which they follow or ignore suggestions. We also
measure the acceptability of the DSS in an exit survey. Our results show that
participants tend to score better with the DSS, that the score increase is due

numerical analysis and engineering, the algorithm has been already proposed to
determine its sign on (0,{pi}/2]. This paper proposes a procedure to extend the
interval to (0, +{\inf}). Such generalization is by no means trivial, for the
process depends on boundedness of roots and square-free factorization of mixed
trigonometric-polynomials.

subtropical countries that affect millions every year and is considered a
significant burden for public health. Its geographic distribution makes it
highly sensitive to climate conditions. Here, we explore the effect of climate
variables using the Generalized Additive Model for location, scale, and shape
(GAMLSS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms. Using the reported
number of dengue cases, we obtained reliable predictions. The uncertainty of
the predictions was also measured. These predictions will serve as input to
health officials to further improve and optimize the allocation of resources
prior to dengue outbreaks.

the wiretap channel in physical layer security to enhance the secrecy rate. In
practice, the eavesdropper can also deploy an IRS, namely illegitimate IRS, to
deteriorate the secrecy rate. This paper studies the interplay between a
transmitter, a legitimate IRS, and an illegitimate IRS in a multiple-input
single-output (MISO) wiretap channel. We formulate a max-min secrecy rate
problem, where all the information is available at the transmitter and the
receivers. We aim to design an efficient transmit beamforming and phase
shifting strategy of the legitimate IRS, under the worst-case secrecy rate
achieved based on optimizing the phase-shifting strategy of the illegitimate
IRS. We propose three solution methods based on the gradient descent ascent
(GDA), the alternate optimization (AO), and the mixed Nash equilibrium (NE) in
zero-sum games in strategic form. Simulation results show that for the
continuous phase-shifting strategies, AO usually does not guarantee
convergence, although it may achieve better performance than GDA in some
iterations. GDA usually converges to a stationary point. Discrete
phase-shifting strategies improve the convergence behavior of AO and GDA, while
there is a single mixed NE with the highest secrecy rate.

  humans and machines",,,,,"cs.AI cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In popular media, there is often a connection drawn between the advent of
awareness in artificial agents and those same agents simultaneously achieving
human or superhuman level intelligence. In this work, we explore the validity
and potential application of this seemingly intuitive link between
consciousness and intelligence. We do so by examining the cognitive abilities
associated with three contemporary theories of conscious function: Global
Workspace Theory (GWT), Information Generation Theory (IGT), and Attention
Schema Theory (AST). We find that all three theories specifically relate
conscious function to some aspect of domain-general intelligence in humans.
With this insight, we turn to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
find that, while still far from demonstrating general intelligence, many
state-of-the-art deep learning methods have begun to incorporate key aspects of
each of the three functional theories. Having identified this trend, we use the
motivating example of mental time travel in humans to propose ways in which
insights from each of the three theories may be combined into a single unified
and implementable model. Given that it is made possible by cognitive abilities
underlying each of the three functional theories, artificial agents capable of
mental time travel would not only possess greater general intelligence than
current approaches, but also be more consistent with our current understanding
of the functional role of consciousness in humans, thus making it a promising
near-term goal for AI research.

recent times because of its various application in signal processing, paraxial
optical systems, digital algorithms, optical encryption and so on. However, the
FMT is inadequate for localized analysis of non-transient signals, as such, it
is imperative to introduce a unique localized transform coined as the short
time free metaplectic transform (STFMT). In this paper, we investigate the
STFMT. Firstly, we propose the definition of the STFMT, and provide the time
frequency analysis of the proposed transform in the FMT domain. Secondly, we
investigate the basic properties of the proposed transform including the
reconstruction formula, Moyals formula. The emergence of the STFMT definition
and its properties broadens the development of time-frequency representation of
higher-dimensional signals theory to a certain extent. Finally, we extend some
different uncertainty principles (UP) from quantum mechanics including Liebs,
Pitts UP, Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, Hausdorff-Young, Hardys UP,
Beurlings UP, Logarithmic UP, and Nazarovs UP which have already been well
studied in the FMT domain

localized defects in crystals. This method solves an integral equation in the

enables one to express the resonance in terms of a ""resonance source"", a
function that is strictly localized within the defect region. The kernel of the
integral equation, to be applied on such a source term, is the Green function
of the perfect crystal, which we show can be computed efficiently by a complex
deformation of the Brillouin zone, named Brillouin Complex Deformation (BCD),
thereby extending to reciprocal space the concept of complex coordinate
transformations.
