combination of normal-incidence X-ray standing waves, low energy electron
diffraction, scanning tunnelling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the systems TCNQ and F4TCNQ on
Ag(100) lie at the boundary between these two possibilities and thus represent
ideal model systems with which to study this effect. A room-temperature
commensurate phase of adsorbed TCNQ is found not to involve Ag adatoms, but to
adopt an inverted bowl configuration, long predicted but not previously
identified experimentally. By contrast, a similar phase of adsorbed F4TCNQ does
lead to Ag adatom incorporation in the overlayer, the cyano endgroups of the
molecule being twisted relative to the planar quinoid ring. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations show that this behaviour is consistent with the
adsorption energetics. Annealing of the commensurate TCNQ overlayer phase leads
to an incommensurate phase that does appear to incorporate Ag adatoms. Our
results indicate that the inclusion (or exclusion) of metal atoms into the
organic monolayers is the result of both thermodynamic and kinetic factors.

recently. Existing methods are typically based on deep neural networks and
require training on large datasets with tens of thousands of samples. In
practice, however, the size of class-specific chemical datasets is usually
limited (e.g., dozens of samples) due to labor-intensive experimentation and
data collection. This presents a considerable challenge for the deep learning
generative models to comprehensively describe the molecular design space.
Another major challenge is to generate only physically synthesizable molecules.
This is a non-trivial task for neural network-based generative models since the
relevant chemical knowledge can only be extracted and generalized from the
limited training data. In this work, we propose a data-efficient generative
model that can be learned from datasets with orders of magnitude smaller sizes
than common benchmarks. At the heart of this method is a learnable graph
grammar that generates molecules from a sequence of production rules. Without
any human assistance, these production rules are automatically constructed from
training data. Furthermore, additional chemical knowledge can be incorporated
in the model by further grammar optimization. Our learned graph grammar yields
state-of-the-art results on generating high-quality molecules for three monomer
datasets that contain only ${\sim}20$ samples each. Our approach also achieves
remarkable performance in a challenging polymer generation task with only $117$
training samples and is competitive against existing methods using $81$k data
points. Code is available at https://github.com/gmh14/data_efficient_grammar.

Especially in challenging situations, this leads to the fact that target

participants is not modeled directly in the environmental model so that tracked

model the interaction between road users on already tracked objects by applying
the movement rules (separation, cohesion, alignment) on the boids. This
facilitates the creation of semantic neighborhood information between road
users. We show in a comprehensive simulation that with only 7 boids per traffic

The co-supporting hypothesis of Toh & Itano (2005) is checked in full-scale
channels at low to moderate Reynolds numbers, from two points of view. To study
the top-down influence of the outer structures on the spanwise motion of the
near-wall streaks, a method inspired by particle-image velocimetry is used to
track the spanwise position of the streaks. Their spanwise advection velocity
is found to be affected by the hierarchy of large-scale circulations in the
logarithmic layer, but their spanwise streak density is only weakly related to
the LSMs. The evidence suggests that a top-down influence exists and drives the
drift of the streaks in the spanwise direction, as suggested by Toh & Itano
(2005), but that the hypothesized streak accumulation rarely occurs. Numerical
experiments at Re_tau about 535 are then performed to clarify the role of the
near-wall streaks in the generation and preservation of the outer LSMs. The
results show that the merger of the near-wall streaks is only weakly correlated
with the generation of the LSMs, and that removing the near-wall roots of the
LSMs does not affect the evolution of their outer region. It is concluded that
the bottom-up influence from the near-wall streaks is not essential for the LSM
generation and preservation, also weakening the evidence for the co-supporting
hypothesis.

of an orthogonal $2$-varifold which minimizes the $L^2$ curvature in the

total transmit power, shows that EMI has a strong impact on DF relay-assisted

turns out that IRS-aided communications is more resilient to EMI. To beat an

However, these circuits typically operate at telecommunication wavelengths

the narrow PL lines is independent of the moir\'e potential, and instead likely
due to extrinsic effects such as nanobubbles or defects. We show that while the

Graph filters are one such tool for network data and have been used in a myriad
of applications. But graph filters work only with a fixed number of nodes
despite the expanding nature of practical networks. Learning filters in this
setting is challenging not only because of the increased dimensions but also
because the connectivity is known only up to an attachment model. We propose a
filter learning scheme for data over expanding graphs by relying only on such a
model. By characterizing the filter stochastically, we develop an empirical
risk minimization framework inspired by multi-kernel learning to balance the
information inflow and outflow at the incoming nodes. We particularize the
approach for denoising and semi-supervised learning (SSL) over expanding graphs
and show near-optimal performance compared with baselines relying on the exact
topology. For SSL, the proposed scheme uses the incoming node information to
improve the task on the existing ones. These findings lay the foundation for
learning representations over expanding graphs by relying only on the

structures from multiple views for robust clustering, and has been attracting
considerable attention in recent years. Despite significant progress, most of
the previous multi-view subspace clustering algorithms are still faced with two
limitations. First, they usually focus on the consistency (or commonness) of
multiple views, yet often lack the ability to capture the cross-view
inconsistencies in subspace representations. Second, many of them overlook the
local structures of multiple views and cannot jointly leverage multiple local
structures to enhance the subspace representation learning. To address these
two limitations, in this paper, we propose a jointly smoothed multi-view
subspace clustering (JSMC) approach. Specifically, we simultaneously
incorporate the cross-view commonness and inconsistencies into the subspace
representation learning. The view-consensus grouping effect is presented to
jointly exploit the local structures of multiple views to regularize the
view-commonness representation, which is further associated with the low-rank
constraint via the nuclear norm to strengthen its cluster structure. Thus the
cross-view commonness and inconsistencies, the view-consensus grouping effect,
and the low-rank representation are seamlessly incorporated into a unified
objective function, upon which an alternating optimization algorithm is
performed to achieve a robust subspace representation for clustering.
Experimental results on a variety of real-world multi-view datasets confirm the
superiority of our approach. Code available:

calculate precisely the decay rate of the electroweak vacuum in such a case. We
include one-loop effects which are crucial to determine the overall

the muon anomalous magnetic moment is consistent with the observed value at the

embedding that is disentangled, well behaved, and supports highly semantic
textual descriptions. MotionCLIP gains its unique power by aligning its latent
space with that of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model.
Aligning the human motion manifold to CLIP space implicitly infuses the
extremely rich semantic knowledge of CLIP into the manifold. In particular, it
helps continuity by placing semantically similar motions close to one another,
and disentanglement, which is inherited from the CLIP-space structure.
MotionCLIP comprises a transformer-based motion auto-encoder, trained to
reconstruct motion while being aligned to its text label's position in
CLIP-space. We further leverage CLIP's unique visual understanding and inject
an even stronger signal through aligning motion to rendered frames in a
self-supervised manner. We show that although CLIP has never seen the motion
domain, MotionCLIP offers unprecedented text-to-motion abilities, allowing
out-of-domain actions, disentangled editing, and abstract language
specification. For example, the text prompt ""couch"" is decoded into a sitting
down motion, due to lingual similarity, and the prompt ""Spiderman"" results in a
web-swinging-like solution that is far from seen during training. In addition,
we show how the introduced latent space can be leveraged for motion
interpolation, editing and recognition.

generalization by minimizing a \textit{perturbed loss} defined as the maximum
loss within a neighborhood in the parameter space. However, we show that both
sharp and flat minima can have a low perturbed loss, implying that SAM does not
always prefer flat minima. Instead, we define a \textit{surrogate gap}, a
measure equivalent to the dominant eigenvalue of Hessian at a local minimum
when the radius of the neighborhood (to derive the perturbed loss) is small.
The surrogate gap is easy to compute and feasible for direct minimization
during training. Based on the above observations, we propose Surrogate
\textbf{G}ap Guided \textbf{S}harpness-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}inimization
(GSAM), a novel improvement over SAM with negligible computation overhead.
Conceptually, GSAM consists of two steps: 1) a gradient descent like SAM to
minimize the perturbed loss, and 2) an \textit{ascent} step in the
\textit{orthogonal} direction (after gradient decomposition) to minimize the
surrogate gap and yet not affect the perturbed loss. GSAM seeks a region with
both small loss (by step 1) and low sharpness (by step 2), giving rise to a
model with high generalization capabilities. Theoretically, we show the
convergence of GSAM and provably better generalization than SAM. Empirically,
GSAM consistently improves generalization (e.g., +3.2\% over SAM and +5.4\%
over AdamW on ImageNet top-1 accuracy for ViT-B/32). Code is released at \url{

probe PLMs and models with visual signals, including vision-language pretrained

density surrounding it, causing a spike in the DM density profile. The spike
around the supermassive BH at the center of the Milky Way may lead to a
dramatic enhancement of the gamma-ray flux of DM annihilation from the galactic
center (GC). In this work, we analyze the gamma-ray data of the innermost
region (i.e., the inner 1$^\circ$) of the GC to search for potential line-like
signals from the BH spike. Such line-like signals could be generated in the
process of DM particles annihilating into double photons. We adopt the
gamma-ray data from the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE). Although the
DAMPE has a much smaller effective area than the Fermi-LAT, the gamma-ray line
search can benefit from its unprecedented high energy resolution. No
significant line-like signals are found in our analysis. We derive upper limits
on the cross section of the annihilation based on this non-detection. We find
that despite the DAMPE's small effective area for photon detection, we can
still place strong constraints on the cross section ($\left<\sigma
v\right>\lesssim10^{-27}\,{\rm cm^3\,s^{-1}}$) in the spike scenario due to the
very bright model-expected flux from the spike. Our results indicate that
either DM does not annihilate primarily through the $\gamma\gamma$ channel in
the mass range we considered or no sharp density spike is present at the GC.

methods to predict gaze patterns during naturalistic reading. While promising
results have been obtained through the use of transformer-based language
models, little work has been undertaken to relate the performance of such
models to general text characteristics. In this paper we report on experiments
with two eye-tracking corpora of naturalistic reading and two language models
(BERT and GPT-2). In all experiments, we test effects of a broad spectrum of
features for predicting human reading behavior that fall into five categories
(syntactic complexity, lexical richness, register-based multiword combinations,
readability and psycholinguistic word properties). Our experiments show that
both the features included and the architecture of the transformer-based
language models play a role in predicting multiple eye-tracking measures during
naturalistic reading. We also report the results of experiments aimed at
determining the relative importance of features from different groups using
SP-LIME.

located samples onto regular grid positions. This is important in frame-rate
up-conversion, super-resolution, and image warping among others. A
state-of-the-art high quality model-based resampling technique is
frequency-selective mesh-to-grid resampling which requires pre-estimation of
key points. In this paper, we propose a new key point agnostic
frequency-selective mesh-to-grid resampling that does not depend on
pre-estimated key points. Hence, the number of data points that are included is
reduced drastically and the run time decreases significantly. To compensate for
the key points, a spectral weighting function is introduced that models the
optical transfer function in order to favor low frequencies more than high
ones. Thereby, resampling artefacts like ringing are supressed reliably and the
resampling quality increases. On average, the new AFSMR is conceptually simpler
and gains up to 1.2 dB in terms of PSNR compared to the original mesh-to-grid
resampling while being approximately 14.5 times faster.

importance to modern sciences, being particularly relevant in biomedicine. An
ideal image sensor should be usable through all the electromagnetic spectrum

the needs of many microscopy applications, and it should be cheap, in order to
ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system. However, current image
sensor technologies have fundamental limitations in terms of bandwidth, imaging
rate or price. In here, we briefly sketch the principles of an alternative
image sensor concept termed Single-pulse Photoacoustic Electromagnetic
Detection (SPEED). SPEED leverages the principles of optoacoustic
(photoacoustic) tomography to overcome several of the hard limitations of
todays image sensors. Specifically, SPEED sensors can operate with a massive
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum at high frame rate (millions of frames
per second) and low cost. Using simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of
the SPEED methodology and we discuss the step towards its implementation.

reactions are considered rare events. Atomistic simulations are typically
biased along a low-dimensional representation of a chemical reaction in an
atomic structure space, i.e., along the collective variable, to accelerate
sampling of these improbable events. However, suitable collective variables are
often complicated to guess due to the complexity of the transitions. Therefore,
we present an automatic method of generating robust collective variables from
atomic representation vectors, using either fixed Behler-Parrinello functions
or representations extracted from pre-trained machine learning potentials.
Variational autoencoder with these representations as inputs is trained while
its latent space with arbitrary dimension gives us the set of collective
variables. The resulting collective variables inherit all necessary invariances
from the atomic representations and can be trained entirely unsupervised. The
method's effectiveness is demonstrated using three different chemical
reactions, one being the complex hydrolysis of a heterogeneous aluminosilicate
catalyst. Lastly, we consider the method in the context of unseen atomic
structure prediction, efficiently creating structures for different values of
collective variables in a generative model fashion.

widely useful for many research groups; (b) and they should produce
reproducible findings. In robotic manipulation research, there is a trade-off
between reproducibility and broad accessibility. If the benchmark is kept
restrictive (fixed hardware, objects), the numbers are reproducible but the
setup becomes less general. On the other hand, a benchmark could be a loose set
of protocols (e.g. object sets) but the underlying variation in setups make the
results non-reproducible. In this paper, we re-imagine benchmarking for robotic
manipulation as state-of-the-art algorithmic implementations, alongside the
usual set of tasks and experimental protocols. The added baseline
implementations will provide a way to easily recreate SOTA numbers in a new
local robotic setup, thus providing credible relative rankings between existing
approaches and new work. However, these local rankings could vary between
different setups. To resolve this issue, we build a mechanism for pooling
experimental data between labs, and thus we establish a single global ranking
for existing (and proposed) SOTA algorithms. Our benchmark, called
Ranking-Based Robotics Benchmark (RB2), is evaluated on tasks that are inspired
from clinically validated Southampton Hand Assessment Procedures. Our benchmark
was run across two different labs and reveals several surprising findings. For
example, extremely simple baselines like open-loop behavior cloning, outperform
more complicated models (e.g. closed loop, RNN, Offline-RL, etc.) that are
preferred by the field. We hope our fellow researchers will use RB2 to improve

\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in the second component becomes a Polish space under
the fibered transport distance, which enjoys a weak Riemannian structure
reminiscent of the one proposed by F. Otto for the classical quadratic
Wasserstein space. Three fundamental issues are addressed: 1) We develop an
abstract theory of gradient flows with respect to the new topology; 2) We show
applications that identify a novel fibered gradient flow structure on a large
class of evolution PDEs with heterogeneities; 3) We exploit our method to
derive long-time behavior and global-in-time mean-field limits in a

using passive metallic reflectors that provide strong reflections. However,
despite its inherent radio advantage, metals can dramatically influence the
landscape's appearance - especially the indoor environment. A conceptual view
of escaping this is by using transparent reflectors. In this work, for the very
first time, we evaluate the wireless propagation characteristics of passive
transparent reflectors in an indoor environment at 28 GHz, 39 GHz, 120 GHz, and
144 GHz bands. In particular, we investigate the penetration loss and the
reflection characteristics at different frequencies and compare them against
the other common indoor materials such as ceiling tile, clear glass, drywall,
plywood, and metal. The measurement results suggest that the transparent
reflector, apart from an obvious advantage of transparency, has a higher
penetration loss than the common indoor materials (excluding metal) and
performs similarly to metal in terms of reflection. Our experimental results
directly translate to better reflection performance and preserving the radio
waves within the environment than common indoor materials, with potential
applications in controlled wireless communication.

The common solution is to use shortcut connections and normalization layers,

there is strong evidence to suggest that ResNets behave more like ensembles of
shallower networks than truly deep ones. Recently, it was shown that deep
vanilla networks (i.e. networks without normalization layers or shortcut

transformations to their activation functions. However, this method (called
Deep Kernel Shaping) isn't fully compatible with ReLUs, and produces networks
that overfit significantly more than ResNets on ImageNet. In this work, we
rectify this situation by developing a new type of transformation that is fully

our method, which introduces negligible extra computational cost, achieves
validation accuracies with deep vanilla networks that are competitive with
ResNets (of the same width/depth), and significantly higher than those obtained

decision regions. We use these visualizations to investigate issues related to
reproducibility and generalization in neural network training. We observe that
changes in model architecture (and its associate inductive bias) cause visible
changes in decision boundaries, while multiple runs with the same architecture
yield results with strong similarities, especially in the case of wide
architectures. We also use decision boundary methods to visualize double
descent phenomena. We see that decision boundary reproducibility depends
strongly on model width. Near the threshold of interpolation, neural network
decision boundaries become fragmented into many small decision regions, and
these regions are non-reproducible. Meanwhile, very narrows and very wide
networks have high levels of reproducibility in their decision boundaries with
relatively few decision regions. We discuss how our observations relate to the
theory of double descent phenomena in convex models. Code is available at

with discrepancies between theory and observations and with unknown importance
of the episodic mass loss. To address this we need increased numbers of
classified sources stars spanning a range of metallicity environments. We aim
to remedy the situation by applying machine learning techniques to recently
available extensive photometric catalogs. We used IR/Spitzer and
optical/Pan-STARRS, with Gaia astrometric information, to compile a large
catalog of known massive stars in M31 and M33, which were grouped in Blue, Red,
Yellow, B[e] supergiants, Luminous Blue Variables, Wolf-Rayet, and background
galaxies. Due to the high imbalance, we implemented synthetic data generation
to populate the underrepresented classes and improve separation by
undersampling the majority class. We built an ensemble classifier using color
indices. The probabilities from Support Vector Classification, Random Forests,
and Multi-layer Perceptron were combined for the final classification. The
overall weighted balanced accuracy is ~83%, recovering Red supergiants at ~94%,
Blue/Yellow/B[e] supergiants and background galaxies at ~50-80%, Wolf-Rayets at
~45%, and Luminous Blue Variables at ~30%, mainly due to their small sample
sizes. The mixing of spectral types (no strict boundaries in their color
indices) complicates the classification. Independent application to IC 1613,
WLM, and Sextans A galaxies resulted in an overall lower accuracy of ~70%,
attributed to metallicity and extinction effects. The missing data imputation
was explored using simple replacement with mean values and an iterative
imputor, which proved more capable. We also found that r-i and y-[3.6] were the
most important features. Our method, although limited by the sampling of the
feature space, is efficient in classifying sources with missing data and at
lower metallicitites.

  Architectures in Self-Supervised Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The current literature on self-supervised learning (SSL) focuses on
developing learning objectives to train neural networks more effectively on
unlabeled data. The typical development process involves taking
well-established architectures, e.g., ResNet demonstrated on ImageNet, and
using them to evaluate newly developed objectives on downstream scenarios.
While convenient, this does not take into account the role of architectures
which has been shown to be crucial in the supervised learning literature. In
this work, we establish extensive empirical evidence showing that a network
architecture plays a significant role in SSL. We conduct a large-scale study
with over 100 variants of ResNet and MobileNet architectures and evaluate them
across 11 downstream scenarios in the SSL setting. We show that there is no one
network that performs consistently well across the scenarios. Based on this, we
propose to learn not only network weights but also architecture topologies in
the SSL regime. We show that ""self-supervised architectures"" outperform popular
handcrafted architectures (ResNet18 and MobileNetV2) while performing
competitively with the larger and computationally heavy ResNet50 on major image
classification benchmarks (ImageNet-1K, iNat2021, and more). Our results
suggest that it is time to consider moving beyond handcrafted architectures in
SSL and start thinking about incorporating architecture search into
self-supervised learning objectives.

only about the lensed sources themselves, such as individual high-redshift

for simulating light curves of such events, i.e., the change in apparent
magnitude of the source as it sweeps over the net of caustics generated by
microlenses embedded around the critical region of the lens. The method is
recursive and so any reasonably sized small source can be accommodated, down to
sub-solar scales, in principle. We compare the method, which we dub
\emph{Adaptive Boundary Method}, with other common methods such as simple
inverse ray shooting, and demonstrate that it is significantly more efficient

model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a
non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of
deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space,
thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they
represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field,
which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these
representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we
introduce a pose-driven deformation field based on the linear blend skinning
algorithm, which combines the blend weight field and the 3D human skeleton to
produce observation-to-canonical correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are
more observable, they can regularize the learning of the deformation field.
Moreover, the pose-driven deformation field can be controlled by input skeletal
motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the canonical human
model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent
human modeling methods. The code is available at

show how to extend it to metric differential privacy for location privacy

the inverse task of upscaling a low-resolution, low frame-rate video in space
and time becomes a challenging ill-posed problem due to information loss and
aliasing artifacts. In this paper, we aim to solve the space-time aliasing
problem by learning a spatio-temporal downsampler. Towards this goal, we
propose a neural network framework that jointly learns spatio-temporal
downsampling and upsampling. It enables the downsampler to retain the key
patterns of the original video and maximizes the reconstruction performance of
the upsampler. To make the downsamping results compatible with popular image
and video storage formats, the downsampling results are encoded to uint8 with a
differentiable quantization layer. To fully utilize the space-time
correspondences, we propose two novel modules for explicit temporal propagation
and space-time feature rearrangement. Experimental results show that our
proposed method significantly boosts the space-time reconstruction quality by
preserving spatial textures and motion patterns in both downsampling and
upscaling. Moreover, our framework enables a variety of applications, including
arbitrary video resampling, blurry frame reconstruction, and efficient video
storage.

Manipulation via Visual Object Location Estimation (m-VOLE), an approach that
explores the environment in search for target objects, computes their 3D

locations even when the objects are not visible, thus robustly aiding the task
of manipulating these objects throughout the episode. Our evaluations show a
massive 3x improvement in success rate over a model that has access to the same

about idealized localization and perception that are commonly employed by
recent works in embodied AI -- an important step towards training agents for

Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) uncovered its radio-loud nature, making it
one of the most distant known to date in this class. By using data from several
radio surveys of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly 23$^\mathrm{h}$ field and from
dedicated follow-up, we were able to constrain the radio spectrum of VIK
J2318$-$3113 in the observed range $\sim$0.1--10 GHz. At high frequencies
(0.888--5.5 GHz in the observed frame) the QSO presents a steep spectrum
($\alpha_{\rm r}$=1.24, with $S_\nu\propto \nu^{-\alpha_{\rm r}}$), while at
lower frequencies (0.4--0.888 GHz in the observed frame) it is nearly flat. The
overall spectrum can be modelled by either a curved function with a rest-frame
turnover around 5 GHz, or with a smoothly varying double power law that is flat
below a rest-frame break frequency of about 20 GHz and which significantly
steepens above it. Based on the model adopted, we estimated that the radio jets
of VIK J2318$-$3113 must be a few hundred years old, in the case of a turnover,
or less than few$\times$10$^4$ years, in the case of a break in the spectrum.
Having multiple observations at two frequencies (888 MHz and 5.5 GHz), we
further investigated the radio variability previously reported for this source.
We found that the marginally significant flux density variations are consistent
with the expectations from refractive interstellar scintillation, even though
relativistic effects related to the orientation of the source may still play a
non-negligible role. Further radio and X-ray observations are required to
conclusively discern the nature of this variation.

in a galaxy provides its central active galactic nucleus (AGN) with fuel to
drive outflows that entrain and expel a significant fraction of the
circumgalactic medium (CGM). This in turn suppresses replenishment of the
interstellar medium, causing the galaxy to quench up to several Gyr after the
merger. We start by performing a zoom simulation of a present-day star-forming
disc galaxy with the EAGLE galaxy formation model. Then, we re-simulate the
galaxy with controlled changes to its initial conditions, using the genetic
modification technique. These modifications either increase or decrease the
stellar mass ratio of the galaxy's last significant merger, which occurs at
$z\approx 0.74$. The halo reaches the same present-day mass in all cases, but
changing the mass ratio of the merger yields markedly different galaxy and CGM
properties. We find that a merger can unlock rapid growth of the central
supermassive black hole if it disrupts the co-rotational motion of gas in the
black hole's vicinity. Conversely, if a less disruptive merger occurs and gas
close to the black hole is not disturbed, the AGN does not strongly affect the
CGM, and consequently the galaxy continues to form stars. Our result
illustrates how a unified view of AGN feedback, the baryon cycle and the

the giant Sunburst arc (z=2.37). Our lens model predicts Tr to be within a
fraction of an arcsecond from the critical curve, having a larger magnification
factor than previously found, but still not large enough to explain the
observed flux and lack of counterimages. Possible candidate counterimages are
discussed that would lower the magnification required to explain Tr, but
extreme magnification factors ($\mu>1000$) are still required, even in that
case. The presence of a small mass perturber with a mass comparable to a dwarf
galaxy ($M\sim 10^8 \,{\rm M}_{\odot}$) near the position of Tr is needed in
order to explain the required magnification and morphology of the lensed

used to constrain models of dark matter. The large apparent brightness and
unresolved nature of the magnified object implies a combination of extreme
magnification and a very luminous and compact source ($r<0.3$ pc). Possible
candidates are discussed, including an hyperluminous star or an accretion disc

hand, the classification-based approach is not sufficiently sensitive due to
the extremely low statistics of signal stars for supervised training. Finally,
the sensitivity of both algorithms in the Gaia-like surveys is negligible. The
enormous size of the Gaia dataset motivates the further development of scalable

with one such system -- ASASSN-14ko -- exhibiting highly regular outbursts on a
timescale of $114 \pm 1$ days. It has been postulated that the outbursts from
this source are generated by the repeated partial disruption of a star, but how
the star was placed onto such a tightly bound orbit about the supermassive
black hole remains unclear. Here we use analytic arguments and three-body
integrations to demonstrate that the Hills mechanism, where a binary system is
destroyed by the tides of the black hole, can lead to the capture of a star on
a $\sim 114$ day orbit and with a pericenter distance that is comparable to the
tidal radius of one of the stars within the binary. Thus, Hills capture can
produce stars on tightly bound orbits that undergo repeated partial disruption,
leading to a viable mechanism for generating not only the outbursts detected
from ASASSN-14ko, but for periodic nuclear transients in general. We also show
that the rate of change of the period of the captured star due to
gravitational-wave emission is likely too small to produce the observed value
for ASASSN-14ko, indicating that in this system there must be additional
effects that contribute to the decay of the orbit. In general, however,
gravitational-wave emission can be important for limiting the lifetimes of
these systems, and could produce observable period decay rates in future

on the four-derivative corrections to Einstein--Maxwell theory. Remarkably, in
four dimensions, these combinations appear in the $2 \to 2$ photon amplitudes,
leading to the hope that the conjecture might be supported using dispersion
relations. However, the presence of a pole arising in the forward limit due to
graviton exchange greatly complicates the use of such arguments. In this paper,
we apply recently developed numerical techniques to handle the graviton pole,
and we find that standard dispersive arguments are not strong enough to imply
the black hole WGC. Specifically, under a fairly typical set of assumptions,
including weak coupling of the EFT and Regge boundedness, a small violation of
the black hole WGC is consistent with unitarity and causality. We quantify the
size of this violation, which vanishes in the limit where gravity decouples and
also depends logarithmically on an infrared cutoff. We discuss the meaning of
these bounds in various scenarios. We also implement a method for bounding
amplitudes without manifestly positive spectral densities, which could be
applied to any system of non-identical states, and we use it to improve bounds

measurements and extrapolate beyond them. Combining luminosity with age and
mass constraints, we show that the predictions of evolutionary models are
narrowly peaked for effective temperature, surface gravity, and planetary
radius. By holding these parameters at their predicted values, we show that
more flexible cloud models can provide good fits to the data while being
consistent with the expectations of evolutionary models.

Standard Model, as is a singlet scalar $s$ mixing with the Higgs boson. If both
are present, it is natural for HNLs to interact with $s$. For a light
singlet,the decay $N\to s\nu$ can dominate over weak HNL decays. We reinterpret
existing constraints on HNL mixing from the DELPHI, CHARM and Belle experiments
for 0.5-100 GeV mass HNLs, taking into account the new decay channel. Although
the constraints are typically weakened, in some cases they can become stronger,
due to observable $s\to\ell^+\ell^-$ decays in the detectors. The method
presented here could be used to recast constraints from other (older)
experiments without resorting to computationally expensive Monte Carlo
simulations. In addition, we update and correct some errors in the analysis of
the original constraints, in the absence of the singlet.

showing that connection probabilities have a conformally invariant scaling
limit. For critical site percolation on the triangular lattice, we prove that
the probability that $n$ vertices belong to the same open cluster has a
well-defined scaling limit for every $n \geq 2$. Moreover, the limiting
functions $P_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ transform covariantly under M\""obius
transformations of the plane as well as under local conformal maps, i.e., they
behave like correlation functions of primary operators in conformal field
theory. In particular, they are invariant under translations, rotations and
inversions, and $P_n(sx_1,\ldots,sx_n)=s^{-5n/48}P_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ for any
$s>0$. This implies that the ratio
$P_3(x_1,x_2,x_3)/\sqrt{P_2(x_1,x_2)P_2(x_1,x_3)P_2(x_2,x_3)}$ is independent
of $x_1,x_2,x_3$, which confirms a prediction of the physics literature.
  We also define a site-diluted spin model whose $n$-point correlation
functions $\mathrm{C}_{n}$ can be expressed in terms of percolation connection
probabilities and, as a consequence, have a well-defined scaling limit with the
same properties as the functions $P_n$. In particular,
$\mathrm{C}_{2}(x_1,x_2)=P_{2}(x_1,x_2)$. We prove that the magnetization field
associated with this spin model has a well-defined scaling limit in an
appropriate space of distributions. The limiting field transforms covariantly
under M\""obius transformations with exponent (scaling dimension) $5/48$. A
heuristic analysis of the four-point function of the magnetization field
reveals the presence of an additional conformal field of scaling dimension
$5/4$, which counts the number of percolation four-arm events and can be
identified with the so-called ""four-leg operator"" of conformal field theory.

are more common than previously thought and it was estimated that at any time
about half a million Ellerman bombs are present in the quiet Sun. We performed
an extensive statistical characterization of the quiet Sun Ellerman bombs
(QSEBs) in these new H$\beta$ observations. We analyzed a 1 h dataset of quiet
Sun observed with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope that consists of spectral
imaging in the H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ lines, as well as spectropolarimetric
imaging in Fe I 617.3 nm. We detected a total of 2809 QSEBs. The lifetime
varies between 9 s and 20.5 min with a median of 1.14 min. The maximum area
ranges between 0.0016 and 0.2603 Mm$^2$ with a median of 0.018 Mm$^2$. A subset
(14%) of the QSEBs display enhancement of the H$\beta$ line core. On average,
the line core brightening appears 0.88 min after the onset of brightening in
the wings, and the distance between these brightenings is 243 km. This gives
rise to an apparent propagation speed ranging between $-$14.3 and +23.5 km
s$^{-1}$, with an average that is upward propagating at +4.4 km $^{-1}$. The
average orientation is nearly parallel to the limbward direction. QSEBs are
nearly uniformly distributed over the field of view but we find empty areas
with the size of mesogranulation. QSEBs are located more frequent near the
magnetic network where they are often bigger, longer lived and brighter. We
conclude that QSEBs are ubiquitous in quiet Sun and appear everywhere except in
areas of mesogranular size with weakest magnetic field
($B_{\rm{LOS}}\lesssim50$~G). Our observations support the interpretation of
reconnection along vertically extended current sheets.

learning system strongly influences its generalization abilities. In the
specific context of deep learning, some of these priors are poorly understood
as they implicitly emerge from the successful heuristics and tentative
approximations of biological brains involved in deep learning design. Through
the lens of supervised image classification problems, this thesis investigates
the implicit integration of a natural clustering prior composed of three
statements: (i) natural images exhibit a rich clustered structure, (ii) image
classes are composed of multiple clusters and (iii) each cluster contains
examples from a single class. The decomposition of classes into multiple
clusters implies that supervised deep learning systems could benefit from
unsupervised clustering to define appropriate decision boundaries. Hence, this
thesis attempts to identify implicit clustering abilities, mechanisms and
hyperparameters in deep learning systems and evaluate their relevance for
explaining the generalization abilities of these systems. We do so through an
extensive empirical study of the training dynamics as well as the neuron- and
layer-level representations of deep neural networks. The resulting collection
of experiments provides preliminary evidence for the relevance of the natural

growth into the Volmer-Weber growth promoted by defect-assisted nucleation. In
this work, the growth of silicon on chemical vapor deposited epitaxial Gr (1 ML
Gr/1ML Gr buffer) on 6H-SiC(0001) substrate is investigated by a combination of
atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman
spectroscopy measurements. It is shown that the perfect control of full-scale
almost defect-free 1 ML Gr with a single surface structure and the ultra-clean
conditions for molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) deposition of silicon represent key
prerequisites for ensuring the growth of extended silicene sheets on epitaxial
graphene.

  Matrices",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been actively researched as a
potential technique for future wireless communications, which intelligently
ameliorate the signal propagation environment. In the conventional design, each
RIS element configures and reflects its received signal independently of all
other RIS elements, which results in a diagonal phase shift matrix. By
contrast, we propose a novel RIS architecture, where the incident signal
impinging on one element can be reflected from another element after an
appropriate phase shift adjustment, which increases the flexibility in the
design of RIS phase shifts, hence, potentially improving the system
performance. The resultant RIS phase shift matrix also has off-diagonal
elements, as opposed to the pure diagonal structure of the conventional design.
Compared to the state-of-art fully-connected/group-connected RIS structures,
our proposed RIS architecture has lower complexity, while attaining a higher
channel gain than the group-connected RIS structure, and approaching that of
the fully-connected RIS structure. We formulate and solve the problem of
maximizing the achievable rate of our proposed RIS architecture by jointly
optimizing the transmit beamforming and the non-diagonal phase shift matrix
based on alternating optimization and semi-define relaxation (SDR) methods.
Moreover, the closed-form expressions of the channel gain, the outage
probability and bit error ratio (BER) are derived. Simulation results
demonstrate that our proposed RIS architecture results in an improved
performance in terms of the achievable rate compared to the conventional
architecture, both in single-user as well as in multi-user scenarios.

objects in the plane, called obstacles. We show that in polynomial time one can
construct an auxiliary (multi-)graph $G$ with vertex set $S$ and every edge
labeled from $\{0, 1\}$, such that a set $S_d \subseteq S$ of obstacles
separates $s$ from $t$ if and only if $G[S_d]$ contains a cycle whose sum of
labels is odd. Using this structural characterization of separating sets of
obstacles we obtain the following algorithmic results.
  In the Obstacle-Removal problem the task is to find a curve in the plane
connecting s to t intersecting at most q obstacles. We give a
$2.3146^qn^{O(1)}$ algorithm for Obstacle-Removal, significantly improving upon
the previously best known $q^{O(q^3)} n^{O(1)}$ algorithm of Eiben and
Lokshtanov (SoCG'20). We also obtain an alternative proof of a constant factor
approximation algorithm for Obstacle-Removal, substantially simplifying the
arguments of Kumar et al. (SODA'21).
  In the Generalized Points-Separation problem, the input consists of the set S
of obstacles, a point set A of k points and p pairs $(s_1, t_1),... (s_p, t_p)$
of points from A. The task is to find a minimum subset $S_r \subseteq S$ such
that for every $i$, every curve from $s_i$ to $t_i$ intersects at least one
obstacle in $S_r$. We obtain $2^{O(p)} n^{O(k)}$-time algorithm for Generalized

Giannopoulos (SoCG'13), who asked about the existence of such an algorithm for
the special case where $(s_1, t_1), ... (s_p, t_p)$ contains all the pairs of
points in A. Finally, we improve the running time of our algorithm to $f(p,k)
n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ when the obstacles are unit disks, where $f(p,k) = 2^O(p)
k^{O(k)}$, and show that, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), the
running time dependence on $k$ of our algorithms is essentially optimal.

quantitative finance. When the Fourier transform of the density function is
available, Fourier-based pricing methods become very competitive compared to
alternative techniques because the integrand in the frequency space has often
higher regularity than in the physical space. However, when designing a
numerical quadrature method for most of these Fourier pricing approaches, two
key aspects affecting the numerical complexity should be carefully considered:
(i) the choice of the damping parameters that ensure integrability and control
the regularity class of the integrand and (ii) the effective treatment of the
high dimensionality of the integration problem. To address these challenges,
based on the extension of the one-dimensional Fourier valuation formula to the
multivariate case, we propose an efficient numerical method for pricing
European multi-asset options based on two complementary ideas. First, we smooth
the Fourier integrand via an optimized choice of damping parameters based on a
proposed heuristic optimization rule. Second, we use the adaptive sparse grid
quadrature based on sparsification and dimension-adaptivity techniques to
accelerate the convergence of the numerical quadrature in high dimensions.
Through an extensive numerical study on the basket and rainbow options under
the multivariate geometric Brownian motion and some multivariate L\'evy models,
we demonstrate the advantages of adaptivity and our damping parameter rule on
the numerical complexity of the quadrature methods. Moreover, we reveal that
our approach achieves substantial computational gains compared to the Monte
Carlo method for different dimensions and parameter constellations.

classical approach for modeling the mechanical responses of materials. However,
when constitutive laws are unknown or when defects and/or high degrees of
heterogeneity are present, these classical models may become inaccurate. In
this work, we propose to use data-driven modeling, which directly utilizes
high-fidelity simulation and/or experimental measurements to predict a
material's response without using conventional constitutive models.
Specifically, the material response is modeled by learning the implicit
mappings between loading conditions and the resultant displacement and/or
damage fields, with the neural network serving as a surrogate for a solution
operator. To model the complex responses due to material heterogeneity and
defects, we develop a novel deep neural operator architecture, which we coin as
the Implicit Fourier Neural Operator (IFNO). In the IFNO, the increment between
layers is modeled as an integral operator to capture the long-range
dependencies in the feature space. As the network gets deeper, the limit of
IFNO becomes a fixed point equation that yields an implicit neural operator and
naturally mimics the displacement/damage fields solving procedure in material
modeling problems. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method for a
number of examples, including hyperelastic, anisotropic and brittle materials.
As an application, we further employ the proposed approach to learn the
material models directly from digital image correlation (DIC) tracking
measurements, and show that the learned solution operators substantially
outperform the conventional constitutive models in predicting displacement
fields.

propose a universal graph reduction procedure to handle large scale graphs. The
reduction exploits community detection for graph partitioning and is applicable
to any graph type and/or density. Experimental evaluation on both synthetic

been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are
capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current
architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and
have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently,
Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have
emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These
models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into
lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not
suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures.
However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the
input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a
large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are
typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a
compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid

convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and
multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via
convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel
Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are
then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network
establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset,

throughout their entire life. These outflows impact both the life and death of
these stars and their surroundings. Theoretical mass-loss rates of hot, massive
stars are derived to be used in applications such as stellar evolution. The
behaviour of these rates in the OB-star regime is analysed, and their effects
on massive-star evolution predictions is studied. Dynamically-consistent models
are computed by solving the spherically symmetric, steady-state
equation-of-motion for a large grid of hot, massive stars. The radiative
acceleration is derived from non-local thermodynamic equilibrium radiative
transfer in the co-moving frame. The resulting mass-loss rates are used to
derive a simple scaling recipe with stellar parameters and to evaluate some
first impacts upon evolution tracks. We provide a new prescription for
steady-state, radiation-driven mass-loss from hot, massive stars depending on
their fundamental parameters. The rates for O-stars are lower by about a factor
~3 than the rates typically used in previous stellar-evolution calculations,
where differences generally decrease with increasing luminosity and
temperature. For cooler B-giants/supergiants we find larger discrepancies. This
arises because we do not find any systematic increase in mass-loss rates below
the so-called bi-stability region; indeed, our results do not show any sign of
a significant bi-stability jump within the parameter range covered by the grid.
Due to the lower mass-loss rates we find that envelopes are not easily stripped
by means of standard steady-state winds, making it difficult to create
classical Wolf-Rayet stars via this channel. However, a remaining key
uncertainty regarding these predictions concerns unsteady mass loss for very
high-luminosity stars close to the Eddington limit as well as the impact of
non-line-driven winds.

location-level annotations, which are burdensome to acquire. When only
count-level (weak) supervisory signals are available, it is arduous and
error-prone to regress total counts due to the lack of explicit spatial
constraints. To address this issue, a novel and efficient counter (referred to
as CrowdMLP) is presented, which probes into modelling global dependencies of
embeddings and regressing total counts by devising a multi-granularity MLP
regressor. In specific, a locally-focused pre-trained frontend is cascaded to
extract crude feature maps with intrinsic spatial cues, which prevent the model
from collapsing into trivial outcomes. The crude embeddings, along with raw
crowd scenes, are tokenized at different granularity levels. The
multi-granularity MLP then proceeds to mix tokens at the dimensions of
cardinality, channel, and spatial for mining global information. An effective
proxy task, namely Split-Counting, is also proposed to evade the barrier of
limited samples and the shortage of spatial hints in a self-supervised manner.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrowdMLP significantly outperforms
existing weakly-supervised counting algorithms and performs on par with
state-of-the-art location-level supervised approaches.

distributions of entities, situations and events that are far from uniform.
Typically, a relatively small set of experiences are encountered frequently,
while many important experiences occur only rarely. The highly-skewed,
heavy-tailed nature of reality poses particular learning challenges that humans
and animals have met by evolving specialised memory systems. By contrast, most
popular RL environments and benchmarks involve approximately uniform variation
of properties, objects, situations or tasks. How will RL algorithms perform in
worlds (like ours) where the distribution of environment features is far less
uniform? To explore this question, we develop three complementary RL
environments where the agent's experience varies according to a Zipfian
(discrete power law) distribution. On these benchmarks, we find that standard
Deep RL architectures and algorithms acquire useful knowledge of common
situations and tasks, but fail to adequately learn about rarer ones. To
understand this failure better, we explore how different aspects of current
approaches may be adjusted to help improve performance on rare events, and show
that the RL objective function, the agent's memory system and self-supervised
learning objectives can all influence an agent's ability to learn from uncommon
experiences. Together, these results show that learning robustly from skewed
experience is a critical challenge for applying Deep RL methods beyond
simulations or laboratories, and our Zipfian environments provide a basis for
measuring future progress towards this goal.

""sex obsession"", the belief that sex, specifically sex assigned at birth, is
the relevant variable for most applications; and ""sex/gender slippage"", the
conflation of sex and gender even in contexts where only one or the other is
known. We then discuss how these pitfalls show up in machine learning studies
based on electronic health record data, which is commonly used for everything
from retrospective analysis of patient outcomes to the development of
algorithms to predict risk and administer care. Finally, we offer a series of
recommendations about how machine learning researchers can produce both
research and algorithms that more carefully engage with questions of
sex/gender, better serving all patients, including transgender people.

chemical processes, especially when they involve the interplay of gas-phase and
grain-surface chemistry. In the case of multiple deuteration, comparing
observation with the results of chemical modelling is particularly effective to
study how molecules are inherited in the different stages within the process of
star and planet formation. We aim to study the the D/ H ratio in H2CS across
the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. This study allows us to test current
gas-dust chemical models involving sulfur in dense cores. We present here
single-dish observations of H2CS, HDCS and D2CS with the IRAM 30m telescope. We
analyse their column densities and distributions, and compare these
observations with gas-grain chemical models. The deuteration maps of H2CS in
L1544 are compared with the deuteration maps of methanol, H2CO, N2H+ and HCO+
towards the same source. Furthermore, the single and double deuteration of H2CS
towards the dust peak of L1544 is compared with H2CO and c-C3H2. The difference
between the deuteration of these molecules in L1544 is discussed and compared
with the prediction of chemical models. The maximum deuterium fractionation for
the first deuteration of H2CS is N(HDCS)/N(H2CS)$\sim$30$\%$ and is located
towards the north-east at a distance of about 10000 AU from the dust peak.
While for c-C3H2 the first and second deuteration have a similar efficiency,
for H2CS and H2CO the second deuteration is more efficient, leading to
D2CX/HDCX$\sim$100$\%$ (with X= O or S). Our results imply that the large
deuteration of H2CO and H2CS observed in protostellar cores as well as in
comets is likely inherited from the pre-stellar phase. However, the comparison
with state-of-the-art chemical models suggests that the reaction network for
the formation of the doubly deuterated H2CS and H2CO it is not complete yet.

bias in these systems is not just an academic question, but a matter of public
concern. Media portrayals often center imbalance as the main source of bias,
i.e., that FR models perform worse on images of non-white people or women
because these demographic groups are underrepresented in training data. Recent
academic research paints a more nuanced picture of this relationship. However,
previous studies of data imbalance in FR have focused exclusively on the face
verification setting, while the face identification setting has been largely
ignored, despite being deployed in sensitive applications such as law
enforcement. This is an unfortunate omission, as 'imbalance' is a more complex
matter in identification; imbalance may arise in not only the training data,
but also the testing data, and furthermore may affect the proportion of
identities belonging to each demographic group or the number of images
belonging to each identity. In this work, we address this gap in the research
by thoroughly exploring the effects of each kind of imbalance possible in face
identification, and discuss other factors which may impact bias in this
setting.

of the gluon field tensor using a mean field effective mass for the gluons. The
AMM is considered using the Dirac spin tensor coupled to the EM field tensor

a metric ansatz that represents oblate and prolate static stellar cores for
modified TOV equations. These equations are numerically solved for the final
mass and radius states representing the core collapse of a massive star with a
phase transition leading to an unbound quark-gluon plasma. We find that the
combined shape parameter and AMM effects can alter the coupled EOS-TOV

especially attentive deep learning models, natural language processing has made
many impressive achievements. However, automated legal word processing is still
a difficult branch of natural language processing. Legal sentences are often
long and contain complicated legal terminologies. Hence, models that work well
on general documents still face challenges in dealing with legal documents. We
have verified the existence of this problem with our experiments in this work.
In this dissertation, we selectively present the main achievements in improving
attentive neural networks in automatic legal document processing. Language
models tend to grow larger and larger, though, without expert knowledge, these
models can still fail in domain adaptation, especially for specialized fields
like law.

of missing data. In our EHRs, for example, the missing rates can be as high as
90% for some features, with an average missing rate of around 70% across all

method, named TA-DualCV, which spontaneously leverages multivariate
dependencies across features and longitudinal dependencies both within- and
cross-visit to maximize the information extracted from limited observable
records in EHRs. Specifically, TA-DualCV captures the latent structure of
missing patterns across measurements of different features and it also
considers the time continuity and capture the latent temporal missing patterns
based on both time-steps and irregular time-intervals. TA-DualCV is evaluated
using three large real-world EHRs on two types of tasks: an unsupervised
imputation task by varying mask rates up to 90% and a supervised 24-hour early
prediction of septic shock using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Our results
show that TA-DualCV performs significantly better than all of the existing
state-of-the-art imputation baselines, such as DETROIT and TAME, on both types
of tasks.

sightlines toward three dwarf galaxies in the anti-M31 direction and at the

Sextans A, with $\log N({\rm C IV})$ = $13.06 \pm 0.08$. This is consistent
with our gaseous halo models, where the halo gas mass is determined by the

consider here the wind power forecasting problem in the presence of missing

emphasis on a fully conditional specification method owing to its desirable
properties, e.g., being assumption-free when it comes to these joint
distributions. Then, at the operational forecasting stage, with available
features at hand, one can issue forecasts by implicitly imputing all missing
entries. The approach is applicable to both point and probabilistic

is superior to the common approach, especially in the context of probabilistic

and its own cost-performance ratio. Due to the absence of comparative studies,
we have carried out a performance comparison of these translators using N-Body
as a case study (a well-known problem with high computational demand). The
results obtained show that CPython and PyPy presented poor performance due to
their limitations when it comes to parallelizing algorithms; while Numba and
Cython achieved significantly higher performance, proving to be viable options
to speed up numerical algorithms.

automatic classification of satellite images are time and resource-intensive to
train. The cost of retraining in the context of Big Data presents a practical
challenge when new image data and/or classes are added to a training corpus.
Recognizing the need for an adaptable, accurate, and scalable satellite image
chip classification scheme, in this research we present an ensemble of: i) a
slow to train but high accuracy vision transformer; and ii) a fast to train,
low-parameter convolutional neural network. The vision transformer model
provides a scalable and accurate foundation model. The high-speed CNN provides
an efficient means of incorporating newly labelled data into analysis, at the
expense of lower accuracy. To simulate incremental data, the very large
(~400,000 images) So2Sat LCZ42 satellite image chip dataset is divided into
four intervals, with the high-speed CNN retrained every interval and the vision
transformer trained every half interval. This experimental setup mimics an
increase in data volume and diversity over time. For the task of automated
land-cover/land-use classification, the ensemble models for each data increment
outperform each of the component models, with best accuracy of 65% against a
holdout test partition of the So2Sat dataset. The proposed ensemble and
staggered training schedule provide a scalable and cost-effective satellite

enhancement approach, achieves better quality than uniform sampling at

results in significant simplifications due to using real-time (4Hz) joint-space

design a Connect Task, where the aim is for two robot arms to pick up and

elements of a physical system could enable the observation of unusual phenomena
that are otherwise inaccessible in standard settings. In this regard, a number
of recent theoretical studies have indicated that an asymmetry in either the
short- or long-range complex exchange constants can lead to counterintuitive
effects, for example, the possibility of a Kramer's degeneracy even in the
absence of spin 1/2 or the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here,
we show how such tailored asymmetric interactions can be realized in photonic
integrated platforms by exploiting non-Hermitian concepts, enabling a class of
topological behaviors induced by optical gain. As a demonstration, we implement
the Haldane model, a canonical lattice that relies on asymmetric long-range
hopping in order to exhibit quantum Hall behavior without a net external
magnetic flux. The topological response observed in this lattice is a result of
gain and vanishes in a passive but otherwise identical structure. Our findings
not only enable the realization of a wide class of non-trivial phenomena
associated with tailored interactions, but also opens up avenues to study the
role of gain and nonlinearity in topological systems in the presence of quantum
noise.

upcoming driving scenarios by conditioning the models on the previously
observed signals. The system uses the difference of the output from the
discriminator between the predicted and actual signals as a metric to quantify
the anomaly degree of a driving segment. We take a driver-centric approach,
considering physiological signals from the driver and controller area
network-Bus (CAN-Bus) signals from the vehicle. The approach is implemented
with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract discriminative feature
representations, and with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells to capture
temporal information. The study is implemented and evaluated with the driving
anomaly dataset (DAD), which includes 250 hours of naturalistic recordings
manually annotated with driving events. The experimental results reveal that
recordings annotated with events that are likely to be anomalous, such as
avoiding on-road pedestrians and traffic rule violations, have higher anomaly
scores than recordings without any event annotation. The results are validated
with perceptual evaluations, where annotators are asked to assess the risk and
familiarity of the videos detected with high anomaly scores. The results
indicate that the driving segments with higher anomaly scores are more risky

devices by using them to simulate the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic initial

the dynamics of local observables, we also calculate the Loschmidt echo and a
nontrivial connected correlation function that witnesses long-range many-body

obtain these results, we leverage a variety of error mitigation techniques

analyse the behavior of the pandemic with mathematical models over a long
period of time. The pandemic alternates periods of high and low infections, in
a way that sheds a light on the nature of mathematical model that can be used
for reliable predictions. The main hypothesis of the model presented here is
that the oscillatory behavior is a structural feature of the outbreak, even
without postulating a time-dependence of the coefficients. As such, it should
be reflected by the presence of limit cycles as asymptotic solutions. This
stems from the introduction of (i) a non-linear waning immunity based on the
concept of immunity booster (already used for other pathologies); (ii) a fine
description of the compartments with a discrimination between individuals
infected/vaccinated for the first time, and individuals already
infected/vaccinated, undergoing to new infections/doses. We provide a
proof-of-concept that our novel model is capable of reproducing long-term
oscillatory behavior of many infectious diseases, and, in particular, the
periodic nature of the waves of infection. Periodic solutions are inherent to
the model, and achieved without changing parameter values in time. This may
represent an important step in the long-term modeling of COVID-19 and similar
diseases, as the natural, unforced behavior of the solution shows the
qualitative characteristics observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

With this filter, the arbitrary predictive and posterior distributions of

some particles, in the data space, are used to capture the properties of the

predicted and updated in the RKHSs based on the kernel Kalman rule (KKR).
Simulation results are presented to confirm the improved performance of our
approach with significantly reduced particle numbers, by comparing with the

as a first step for an attacker to break into an otherwise well-defended

has received due amount of attention with many publications proposing defenses
against them. Despite this, the situation has not improved. In this paper, we
aim to understand and explain this phenomenon by looking into the root cause of
the problem. To this end, we examine the literature on attacks and defenses
through a unique lens we propose -- {\em psychological factors (PFs) and

defenses: Attacks have deliberately exploited PFs by leveraging PTs, but
defenses rarely take either of these into consideration, preferring technical
solutions. This explains why existing defenses have achieved limited success.
This prompts us to propose a roadmap for a more systematic approach towards
designing effective defenses against social engineering attacks.

the probability that $C$ is tangent to the outermost circle tends towards
$3/\pi$. These results are found by using positive semidefinite quadratic forms

how deep neural networks operate through concepts that are easily understood

These representations are regularly derived from medical imaging data,
particularly in the field of neuroimaging, in which graphs are used to
represent brain structural and functional wiring patterns (brain connectomes)
and cortical surface models are used to represent the anatomical structure of
the brain. Although explainability techniques have been developed for
identifying important vertices (brain areas) and features for graph
classification, these methods are still lacking for more complex tasks, such as
surface-based modality transfer (or vertex-wise regression). Here, we address
the need for surface-based explainability approaches by developing a framework
for cortical surface-based deep learning, providing a transparent system for
modality transfer tasks. First, we adapted a perturbation-based approach for
use with surface data. Then, we applied our perturbation-based method to
investigate the key features and vertices used by a geometric deep learning
model developed to predict brain function from anatomy directly on a cortical
surface model. We show that our explainability framework is not only able to

attributes on the survival of open-source software projects as measured by
their revision activity. Methods such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox
Proportional-Hazards model, and the visualization of posterior survival

projects which publish major releases, have repositories on multiple hosting

a higher likelihood of survival in the long run. The findings were similar to
the original study; however, a deeper look revealed quantitative

test data that may have a different (shifted) distribution from the training
data. Such methods are typically developed on image data, and their application
to time series data is less explored. Existing works on time series domain
adaptation suffer from inconsistencies in evaluation schemes, datasets, and
backbone neural network architectures. Moreover, labeled target data are often
used for model selection, which violates the fundamental assumption of
unsupervised domain adaptation. To address these issues, we develop a
benchmarking evaluation suite (AdaTime) to systematically and fairly evaluate
different domain adaptation methods on time series data. Specifically, we
standardize the backbone neural network architectures and benchmarking
datasets, while also exploring more realistic model selection approaches that
can work with no labeled data or just a few labeled samples. Our evaluation
includes adapting state-of-the-art visual domain adaptation methods to time
series data as well as the recent methods specifically developed for time
series data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate 11 state-of-the-art
methods on five representative datasets spanning 50 cross-domain scenarios. Our
results suggest that with careful selection of hyper-parameters, visual domain
adaptation methods are competitive with methods proposed for time series domain
adaptation. In addition, we find that hyper-parameters could be selected based
on realistic model selection approaches. Our work unveils practical insights
for applying domain adaptation methods on time series data and builds a solid
foundation for future works in the field. The code is available at

vector boson $A^\prime$ in the mass range of 20 MeV/$c^2$ to 220 MeV/$c^2$ that
kinetically mixes with the Standard Model photon with couplings $\epsilon^2
>10^{-10}$. In addition to the general importance of exploring light, weakly
coupled physics that is difficult to probe with high-energy colliders, a prime
motivation for this search is the possibility that sub-GeV thermal relics
constitute dark matter, a scenario that requires a new comparably light
mediator, where models with a hidden $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, a ""dark"", ""hidden
sector"", or ""heavy"" photon, are particularly attractive. HPS searches for
visible signatures of these heavy photons, taking advantage of their small
coupling to electric charge to produce them via a process analogous to
bremsstrahlung in a fixed target and detect their subsequent decay to
$\mathrm{e}^+ \mathrm{e}^-$ pairs in a compact spectrometer. In addition to
searching for $\mathrm{e}^+ \mathrm{e}^-$ resonances atop large QED
backgrounds, HPS has the ability to precisely measure decay lengths, resulting
in unique sensitivity to dark photons, as well as other long-lived new physics.
After completion of the experiment and operation of engineering runs in 2015
and 2016 at the JLab CEBAF, physics runs in 2019 and 2021 have provided
datasets that are now being analyzed to search for dark photons and other new

this idea is formalized and a reference implementation is introduced.
Experiments are conducted on three meme-style data sets, including a newly
collected set associated with the information war in the Russo-Ukrainian

remixed content that, when compared to similar approaches, more closely aligns
with the preferences and expectations of human observers.

polarised pulsars (TULIPP) survey. For this survey, we identified linearly and
circularly polarised point sources with flux densities brighter than 2 mJy in
LoTSS images at a centre frequency of 144 MHz with a 48 MHz bandwidth. Over 40
known pulsars, half of which are MSPs, were detected as polarised sources in
the LoTSS images and excluded from the survey. We have obtained beam-formed
LOFAR observations of 30 candidates, which were searched for pulsations using
coherent de-dispersion. Here, we present the results of the first year of the
TULIPP survey. We discovered two pulsars, PSRs J1049+5822 and J1602+3901, with
rotational periods of P=0.73 s and 3.7 ms, respectively. We also detected a
further five known pulsars (two slowly-rotating pulsars and three MSPs) for
which accurate sky positions were not available to allow a unique cross-match
with LoTSS sources. This targeted survey presents a relatively efficient method
by which pulsars, particularly MSPs, may be discovered using the flexible
observing modes of sensitive radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre
Array and its pathfinders/precursors, particularly since wide-area all-sky
surveys using coherent de-dispersion are currently computationally infeasible.

in this paper we explore the weakly supervised monocular 3D detection.
Specifically, we first detect 2D boxes on the image. Then, we adopt the

tightly align with associated RoI LiDAR points. This network is learned by
minimizing our newly-proposed 3D alignment loss between the 3D box estimates

in momentum space, which is a canonical model for itinerant magnets in a
weak-coupling regime. By performing the simulated annealing for the model on
the two-dimensional square lattice, we find that the off-diagonal spin
component in the interaction, which becomes nonzero when the vertical mirror
symmetry is broken, gives rise to the square SkX with a definite helicity in an
external magnetic field. We show that the helicity of the centrosymmetric SkXs
is determined by the competition between the off-diagonal and diagonal
anisotropic interactions, the latter of which appears in the discrete
fourfold-rotational lattice structure. Furthermore, we discuss
helicity-dependent physical phenomena by introducing odd-parity multipoles,
where electric (magnetic) and electric (magnetic) toroidal multipoles are
sources of an antisymmetric spin polarization and an Edelstein effect (a
magnetoelectric effect). We also discuss the stability of the SkXs with
different helicities in a magnetic field rotation. Our results provide a way of
engineering the helicity-locked SkXs by the symmetric anisotropic interaction

employ the improved gauge independent on-shell scheme in the renormalized

which couplings of the discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson ($h$) coincide with those
of the standard model while the $Hhh$ coupling vanishes at tree level. The
renormalized decay rate for $H\to hh$ can significantly be changed from the
prediction at tree level due to non-decoupling loop effects of additional Higgs
bosons, even in the near alignment case. We find that the radiative corrections
to the branching ratio of $H\to hh$ can be a few ten percent level in the case
with the masses of additional Higgs bosons being degenerate under the
constraints of perturbative unitarity, vacuum stability and the EW precision
data. Further sizable corrections can be obtained for the case with a mass

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC cs.PF","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Datacenters execute large computational jobs, which are composed of smaller
tasks. A job completes when all its tasks finish, so stragglers -- rare, yet
extremely slow tasks -- are a major impediment to datacenter performance.
Accurately predicting stragglers would enable proactive intervention, allowing
datacenter operators to mitigate stragglers before they delay a job. While much
prior work applies machine learning to predict computer system performance,
these approaches rely on complete labels -- i.e., sufficient examples of all
possible behaviors, including straggling and non-straggling -- or strong
assumptions about the underlying latency distributions -- e.g., whether
Gaussian or not. Within a running job, however, none of this information is
available until stragglers have revealed themselves when they have already
delayed the job. To predict stragglers accurately and early without labeled
positive examples or assumptions on latency distributions, this paper presents
NURD, a novel Negative-Unlabeled learning approach with Reweighting and
Distribution-compensation that only trains on negative and unlabeled streaming
data. The key idea is to train a predictor using finished tasks of
non-stragglers to predict latency for unlabeled running tasks, and then
reweight each unlabeled task's prediction based on a weighting function of its
feature space. We evaluate NURD on two production traces from Google and
Alibaba, and find that compared to the best baseline approach, NURD produces
2--11 percentage point increases in the F1 score in terms of prediction
accuracy, and 2.0--8.8 percentage point improvements in job completion time.

reproduce a wide range of neural activities, including the emergent population
bursting and spike synchrony that underpin brain disorders and normal function.
Exact mean-field models derived from spiking neural networks are extremely
valuable, as such models can be used to determine how individual neuron and
network parameters interact to produce macroscopic network behaviour. In the
paper, we derive and analyze a set of exact mean-field equations for the neural
network with spike frequency adaptation. Specifically, our model is a network
of Izhikevich neurons, where each neuron is modeled by a two dimensional system
consisting of a quadratic integrate and fire equation plus an equation which
implements spike frequency adaptation. Previous work deriving a mean-field
model for this type of network, relied on the assumption of sufficiently slow
dynamics of the adaptation variable. However, this approximation did not
succeeded in establishing an exact correspondence between the macroscopic
description and the realistic neural network, especially when the adaptation
time constant was not large. The challenge lies in how to achieve a closed set
of mean-field equations with the inclusion of the mean-field expression of the
adaptation variable. We address this challenge by using a Lorentzian ansatz
combined with the moment closure approach to arrive at the mean-field system in
the thermodynamic limit. The resulting macroscopic description is capable of
qualitatively and quantitatively describing the collective dynamics of the
neural network, including transition between tonic firing and bursting.

In the real world, it is important that the model trained for both tasks works
under various imaging conditions. However, their variation covered by existing
labeled hand datasets is limited. Thus, it is necessary to adapt the model
trained on the labeled images (source) to unlabeled images (target) with unseen
imaging conditions. While self-training domain adaptation methods (i.e.,
learning from the unlabeled target images in a self-supervised manner) have
been developed for both tasks, their training may degrade performance when the
predictions on the target images are noisy. To avoid this, it is crucial to
assign a low importance (confidence) weight to the noisy predictions during
self-training. In this paper, we propose to utilize the divergence of two
predictions to estimate the confidence of the target image for both tasks.
These predictions are given from two separate networks, and their divergence
helps identify the noisy predictions. To integrate our proposed confidence
estimation into self-training, we propose a teacher-student framework where the
two networks (teachers) provide supervision to a network (student) for
self-training, and the teachers are learned from the student by knowledge
distillation. Our experiments show its superiority over state-of-the-art

propagate in the ion diamagnetic direction. Investigation of a generic drift
fluid model with warm ions and adiabatic electrons, reveals that as \eta_i
decreases, the propagation characteristics of the unstable mode may change
drastically, the mode frequency first decreases in magnitude, and reaches zero
for a critical \eta_i. But as \eta_i goes down further, the mode begins to
propagate in the electron diamagnetic direction. The lower toroidal mode number
perturbations are more prone to reversal in propagation direction. Even for
\eta_i=0, the mode remains unstable, drawing free energy form the density
gradients. Since finite ion temperature appears to be essential for propagation
in the electron direction, it is appropriate to introduce new terminology and
call this wave the warm ion electron drift (WIED) mode. The model drift wave
system is explored within the framework of the two dimensional (2D) weakly
asymmetric ballooning theory (WABT) for local eigenmode satisfying natural
boundary conditions. The physics behind the excitation of the eigenmode
crossing zero frequency is identified to be the reactive instability induced by
the curvature coupling between the positive energy wave and the negative energy
wave, a damped mode in electron direction coupled to a growing mode in the ion
direction in non-dissipative slab limit. Apart from its intrinsic scientific
value, this mechanism may shed some light onto the nature of tokamak edge
turbulence observed in frequencies moderately lower than the electron
diamagnetic frequency; understanding this phenomenon could be helpful in
conceptual design around the edge region of future tokamak.

support vector machine. Online random Fourier feature map algorithms are very
important methods for dealing with large scale nonlinear classification
problems. The main shortcomings of these methods are as follows: (1) Since only
the hyperplane vector is updated during learning while the random directions
are fixed, there is no guarantee that these online methods can adapt to the
change of data distribution when the data is coming one by one. (2) The
dimension of the random direction is often higher for obtaining better
classification accuracy, which results in longer test time. In order to
overcome these shortcomings, a multi-parameter updating Fourier online gradient
descent algorithm (MPU-FOGD) is proposed for large-scale nonlinear
classification problems based on a novel random feature map. In the proposed
method, the suggested random feature map has lower dimension while the
multi-parameter updating strategy can guarantee the learning model can better
adapt to the change of data distribution when the data is coming one by one.
Theoretically, it is proved that compared with the existing random Fourier
feature maps, the proposed random feature map can give a tighter error bound.
Empirical studies on several benchmark data sets demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art online random Fourier feature map methods, the proposed

given few exemplars. A standard pipeline is to extract visual features from
exemplars and match them with query images to infer object counts. Two
essential components in this pipeline are feature representation and similarity
metric. Existing methods either adopt a pretrained network to represent
features or learn a new one, while applying a naive similarity metric with
fixed inner product. We find this paradigm leads to noisy similarity matching
and hence harms counting performance. In this work, we propose a
similarity-aware CAC framework that jointly learns representation and
similarity metric. We first instantiate our framework with a naive baseline
called Bilinear Matching Network (BMNet), whose key component is a learnable
bilinear similarity metric. To further embody the core of our framework, we
extend BMNet to BMNet+ that models similarity from three aspects: 1)
representing the instances via their self-similarity to enhance feature
robustness against intra-class variations; 2) comparing the similarity
dynamically to focus on the key patterns of each exemplar; 3) learning from a
supervision signal to impose explicit constraints on matching results.

significantly outperform state-of-the-art CAC approaches. In addition, we also

individual's identity and a specific spectrum to support the address-based
communication for the metaverse are needed. Therefore, metaverse native or
meta-native communications based on blockchain could be a promising solution to
directly connect entities with their native encrypted addresses that gets rid
of the existing network services based on IP, cellular, HTTP, etc. This paper
proposes a vision of blockchain, encrypted address and address-based access
model for all users, devices, services, etc. to contribute to the metaverse.
Furthermore, the allocation architecture of a designated spectrum for the
metaverse is proposed to remove the barrier to access to the
metaverse/blockchain in response to the initiatives of metaverse and
decentralized Internet.

  Reductions from Real APSP, Real 3SUM, and OV","To appear at STOC'22. Abstract shortened to fit arXiv requirements",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $3$SUM hypothesis, the APSP hypothesis and SETH are the three main
hypotheses in fine-grained complexity. So far, within the area, the first two
hypotheses have mainly been about integer inputs in the Word RAM model of
computation. The ""Real APSP"" and ""Real $3$SUM"" hypotheses, which assert that
the APSP and $3$SUM hypotheses hold for real-valued inputs in a reasonable
version of the Real RAM model, are even more believable than their integer
counterparts.
  Under the very believable hypothesis that at least one of the Integer $3$SUM
hypothesis, Integer APSP hypothesis or SETH is true, Abboud, Vassilevska W. and
Yu [STOC 2015] showed that a problem called Triangle Collection requires
$n^{3-o(1)}$ time on an $n$-node graph.
  Our main result is a nontrivial lower bound for a slight generalization of
Triangle Collection, called All-Color-Pairs Triangle Collection, under the even
more believable hypothesis that at least one of the Real $3$SUM, the Real APSP,
and the OV hypotheses is true. Combined with slight modifications of prior
reductions, we obtain polynomial conditional lower bounds for problems such as
the (static) ST-Max Flow problem and dynamic Max Flow, now under the new weaker
hypothesis.
  Our main result is built on the following two lines of reductions.
  * Real APSP and Real $3$SUM hardness for the All-Edges Sparse Triangle
problem. Prior reductions only worked from the integer variants of these
problems.
  * Real APSP and OV hardness for a variant of the Boolean Matrix
Multiplication problem.
  Along the way we show that Triangle Collection is equivalent to a simpler
restricted version of the problem, simplifying prior work. Our techniques also
have other interesting implications, such as a super-linear lower bound of
Integer All-Numbers $3$SUM based on the Real $3$SUM hypothesis, and a tight
lower bound for a string matching problem based on the OV hypothesis.

cause suction cups to detach, causing drops or damage. Maintaining a suction

inertial forces while the suction cups deform under strain. In this paper, we
consider Grasp Optimized Motion Planning for Suction Transport (GOMP-ST), an
algorithm that combines deep learning with optimization to decrease transport
time while avoiding suction cup failure. GOMP-ST first repeatedly moves a
physical robot, vacuum gripper, and a sample object, while measuring pressure
with a solid-state sensor to learn critical failure conditions. Then, these are
integrated as constraints on the accelerations at the end-effector into a
time-optimizing motion planner. The resulting plans incorporate real-world
effects such as suction cup deformation that are difficult to model
analytically. In GOMP-ST, the learned constraint, modeled with a neural
network, is linearized using Autograd and integrated into a sequential
quadratic program optimization. In 420 experiments with a physical UR5
transporting objects ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 kg, we compare GOMP-ST to baseline
optimizing motion planners. Results suggest that GOMP-ST can avoid suction cup
failure while decreasing transport times from 16% to 58%. For code, video, and

a limited knowledge of the model of the supervisor, from the adversary's point

replacement/deletion attacks and actuator enablement/disablement attacks. The
solution methodology proposed in this work is to reduce the synthesis of the

phenomenon where the $\alpha$ ($^4$He) or a light nuclear cluster tunnels
through the Coulomb barrier formed by its interaction with the heavier daughter

total interaction potential between the two daughter nuclei. We examine the
effects of including nonlocality and deformation in the interaction potential
by calculating the half-lives, $t_{1/2}$, and thereby phenomenological
preformation factors of several nuclei which have the possibility of decaying
by emitting either an $\alpha$ or a light nuclear cluster. The effect of
deformation manifests itself by a decrease in $t_{1/2}$ for all the decays
studied. The effect of nonlocality is studied within two different models of
the nuclear potential: the energy-independent but angular momentum ($l$)
dependent Mumbai (M) potential and the energy-dependent Perey-Buck (PB)
potential. The nonlocal nuclear interaction leads to a decrease in all
half-lives studied. Though the decrease is larger due to the Perey-Buck
potential, half-lives evaluated using the Mumbai potential show a strong
sensitivity to the $l$ value in the decay. This feature of the $\alpha$ and
cluster decay half-lives can provide a complementary tool in addition to
scattering data which are more commonly used to fix the parameters of a

There is an intuitive quality measure for drawings of a graph that measures the
height of a drawing $\phi : G \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ as follows. For a
vertical line $\ell$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$, let the height of $\ell$ be the
cardinality of the set $\ell \cap \phi(G)$. The height of a drawing of $G$ is
the maximum height over all vertical lines. In this paper, instead of abstract
graphs, we fix a drawing and consider plane graphs. In other words, we are
looking for a homeomorphism of the plane that minimizes the height of the
resulting drawing. This problem is equivalent to the homotopy height problem in
the plane, and the homotopic Fr\'echet distance problem. These problems were
recently shown to lie in NP, but no polynomial-time algorithm or NP-hardness
proof has been found since their formulation in 2009. We present the first

(MPQ) makes it hard to determine the optimal bit-width for each layer. Previous
works usually resort to iterative search methods on the training set, which
consume hundreds or even thousands of GPU-hours. In this study, we reveal that
some unique learnable parameters in quantization, namely the scale factors in
the quantizer, can serve as importance indicators of a layer, reflecting the
contribution of that layer to the final accuracy at certain bit-widths. These
importance indicators naturally perceive the numerical transformation during
quantization-aware training, which can precisely provide quantization
sensitivity metrics of layers. However, a deep network always contains hundreds
of such indicators, and training them one by one would lead to an excessive
time cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint training scheme that can
obtain all indicators at once. It considerably speeds up the indicators
training process by parallelizing the original sequential training processes.
With these learned importance indicators, we formulate the MPQ search problem
as a one-time integer linear programming (ILP) problem. That avoids the
iterative search and significantly reduces search time without limiting the
bit-width search space. For example, MPQ search on ResNet18 with our indicators
takes only 0.06 s, which improves time efficiency exponentially compared to
iterative search methods. Also, extensive experiments show our approach can
achieve SOTA accuracy on ImageNet for far-ranging models with various
constraints (e.g., BitOps, compress rate). Code is available on

AF7, are of great interest in the next decade: advanced wakefield structures,
terahertz and sub-terahertz (THz) structures, and RF breakdown physics.
Research on SWFA in the above directions would directly contribute to long-term
large-scale applications, including AAC-based linear colliders and compact
light sources. There is also potentially a strong synergy between SWFA and
other AAC concepts, when structures are combined with plasmas into hybrid AAC

  First, we prove a Liouville type theorem for steady Euler system with
Poiseuille flows as upstream far field state in an infinitely long strip. Due
to the appearance of stagnation points, the nonlinearity of the semilinear
equation for the stream function becomes non-Lipschitz. This creates a
challenging analysis problem since many classical analysis methods do not apply
directly. Second, the uniqueness of flows with positive horizontal velocity
inside the general nozzles is established. Finally, a class of steady

  Asymptotic Analysis and Optimization","accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In next-generation wireless networks, reconfigurable intelligent surface
(RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are foreseeable to
support a large number of antennas at the transceiver as well as a large number
of reflecting elements at the RIS. To fully unleash the potential of RIS, the
phase shifts of RIS elements should be carefully designed, resulting in a
high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem that is hard to solve. In this
paper, we address this scalability issue by partitioning RIS into sub-surfaces,
so as to optimize the phase shifts in sub-surface levels to reduce complexity.
Specifically, each subsurface employs a linear phase variation structure to
anomalously reflect the incident signal to a desired direction, and the sizes
of sub-surfaces can be adaptively adjusted according to channel conditions. We
formulate the achievable rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the
transmit covariance matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Under the RIS partitioning
framework, the RIS phase shifts optimization reduces to the manipulation of the
sub-surface sizes, the phase gradients of sub-surfaces, and the common phase
shifts of sub-surfaces. Then, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the
system with an infinitely large number of transceiver antennas and RIS
elements. The asymptotic analysis provides useful insights on the understanding
of the fundamental performance-complexity tradeoff in RIS partitioning design.
We show that in the asymptotic domain, the achievable rate maximization problem
has a rather simple form. We develop an efficient algorithm to find an
approximate optimal solution via a 1D grid search. By applying the asymptotic
result to a finite-size system with necessary modifications, we show by
numerical results that the proposed design achieves a favorable tradeoff
between system performance and computational complexity.

the end-to-end reliability of multi-hop networks is an important problem
subject to end-to-end delay constraints on the packets. Towards that direction,
Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) based strategies have been recently proposed
wherein the problem statement is to distribute a certain total number of ARQs
(that capture end-to-end delay) across the nodes such that the end-to-end
reliability is optimized. Although such strategies provide a fine control to
trade end-to-end delay with end-to-end reliability, their performance degrades

we propose a Chase Combing Hybrid ARQ (CC-HARQ) based multi-hop network

result, we propose an approximation on the objective function and then prove a
set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the near-optimal ARQ

particularly appealing in slow-fading channels wherein the existing ARQ

method based on diffusion models, that circumvents training on domain pairs.
Image translation with DDIBs relies on two diffusion models trained
independently on each domain, and is a two-step process: DDIBs first obtain
latent encodings for source images with the source diffusion model, and then
decode such encodings using the target model to construct target images. Both
steps are defined via ordinary differential equations (ODEs), thus the process
is cycle consistent only up to discretization errors of the ODE solvers.
Theoretically, we interpret DDIBs as concatenation of source to latent, and
latent to target Schrodinger Bridges, a form of entropy-regularized optimal
transport, to explain the efficacy of the method. Experimentally, we apply
DDIBs on synthetic and high-resolution image datasets, to demonstrate their
utility in a wide variety of translation tasks and their inherent optimal

singular surface energy of the TCI affects equilibrium crystal shapes,
resulting in emergence of unique crystal facets of the TCI. This singular

the glide symmetry in contrast to a TCI protected by a mirror symmetry. In

aspect of Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification. In this work, we
focus on scalable marginalization of latent variables in modeling correlated
data, such as spatio-temporal or functional observations. We first introduce
Gaussian processes (GPs) for modeling correlated data and highlight the
computational challenge, where the computational complexity increases cubically
fast along with the number of observations. We then review the connection
between the state space model and GPs with Mat{\'e}rn covariance for temporal
inputs. The Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother were introduced as a
scalable marginalization technique for computing the likelihood and making
predictions of GPs without approximation. We then introduce recent efforts on
extending the scalable marginalization idea to the linear model of
coregionalization for multivariate correlated output and spatio-temporal
observations. In the final part of this work, we introduce a novel
marginalization technique to estimate interaction kernels and forecast particle
trajectories. The achievement lies in the sparse representation of covariance
function, then applying conjugate gradient for solving the computational
challenges and improving predictive accuracy. The computational advances
achieved in this work outline a wide range of applications in molecular dynamic
simulation, cellular migration, and agent-based models.

artificial intelligence including computer vision and natural language
processing. A DNN is typically trained for many epochs and then a validation
dataset is used to select the DNN in an epoch (we simply call this epoch ""the
last epoch"") as the final model for making predictions on unseen samples, while
it usually cannot achieve a perfect accuracy on unseen samples. An interesting
question is ""how many test (unseen) samples that a DNN misclassifies in the
last epoch were ever correctly classified by the DNN before the last epoch?"".
In this paper, we empirically study this question and find on several benchmark
datasets that the vast majority of the misclassified samples in the last epoch
were ever classified correctly before the last epoch, which means that the
predictions for these samples were flipped from ""correct"" to ""wrong"". Motivated
by this observation, we propose to restrict the behavior changes of a DNN on
the correctly-classified samples so that the correct local boundaries can be
maintained and the flipping error on unseen samples can be largely reduced.
Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets with different modern
network architectures demonstrate that the proposed flipping error reduction
(FER) approach can substantially improve the generalization, the robustness,
and the transferability of DNNs without introducing any additional network
parameters or inference cost, only with a negligible training overhead.

multipartite entanglement criteria based on permutation moments, which have an
effective implementation with either the generalized control-SWAP quantum

The quantities associated with these criteria have clear physical meaning and
can be used as entanglement quantifiers, with which we show the entanglement

architecture design thanks to their record-breaking performance in various
vision tasks. In parallel, to fulfill the goal of deploying ViTs into
real-world vision applications, their robustness against potential malicious
attacks has gained increasing attention. In particular, recent works show that
ViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks as compared with convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), and conjecture that this is because ViTs focus more on
capturing global interactions among different input/feature patches, leading to
their improved robustness to local perturbations imposed by adversarial
attacks. In this work, we ask an intriguing question: ""Under what kinds of
perturbations do ViTs become more vulnerable learners compared to CNNs?"" Driven
by this question, we first conduct a comprehensive experiment regarding the
robustness of both ViTs and CNNs under various existing adversarial attacks to
understand the underlying reason favoring their robustness. Based on the drawn
insights, we then propose a dedicated attack framework, dubbed Patch-Fool, that
fools the self-attention mechanism by attacking its basic component (i.e., a
single patch) with a series of attention-aware optimization techniques.
Interestingly, our Patch-Fool framework shows for the first time that ViTs are
not necessarily more robust than CNNs against adversarial perturbations. In
particular, we find that ViTs are more vulnerable learners compared with CNNs
against our Patch-Fool attack which is consistent across extensive experiments,
and the observations from Sparse/Mild Patch-Fool, two variants of Patch-Fool,
indicate an intriguing insight that the perturbation density and strength on
each patch seem to be the key factors that influence the robustness ranking
between ViTs and CNNs.

precision than in previous experiments. The obtained differential cross

content biased towards the target language. To narrow the data gap, we propose
an online self-training approach, which simultaneously uses the pseudo parallel

complex structure of RL, we propose two certification criteria: per-state
action stability and cumulative reward bound. To further improve the
certification, we propose new partition and aggregation protocols to train
robust policies. We further prove that some of the proposed certification
methods are theoretically tight and some are NP-Complete problems. We leverage
COPA to certify three RL environments trained with different algorithms and
conclude: (1) The proposed robust aggregation protocols such as temporal
aggregation can significantly improve the certifications; (2) Our certification
for both per-state action stability and cumulative reward bound are efficient
and tight; (3) The certification for different training algorithms and
environments are different, implying their intrinsic robustness properties. All

platform perspective. In such setting, new datasets sequentially arrive at the
platform, where an architecture and hyper-parameter configuration is
recommended to train the optimal face detector for each dataset. This, however,
brings two major challenges: (1) how to predict the best configuration for any

oscillatory tails do not decay. Previous research on continuous third-order and
fourth-order Karpman equations has shown that nanoptera occur in specific
settings. We use exponential asymptotic techniques to identify traveling
nanoptera in singularly-perturbed continuous Karpman equations. We then study
the effect of discretization on nanoptera by applying a finite-difference
discretization to continuous Karpman equations and studying traveling-wave
solutions. The finite-difference discretization turns a continuous Karpman
equation into an advance--delay equation, which we study using exponential
asymptotic analysis. By comparing nanoptera in these discrete Karpman equations
with nanoptera in their continuous counterparts, we show that the oscillation
amplitudes and periods in the nanoptera tails differ in the continuous and

  Coarse-to-fine Localization and Classification","Accepted at ISBI 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate and efficient lumbar spine disease identification is crucial for
clinical diagnosis. However, existing deep learning models with millions of
parameters often fail to learn with only hundreds or dozens of medical images.
These models also ignore the contextual relationship between adjacent objects,
such as between vertebras and intervertebral discs. This work introduces a
multi-scale context-guided network with coarse-to-fine localization and
classification, named CCF-Net, for lumbar spine disease identification.
Specifically, in learning, we divide the localization objective into two
parallel tasks, coarse and fine, which are more straightforward and effectively
reduce the number of parameters and computational cost. The experimental
results show that the coarse-to-fine design presents the potential to achieve
high performance with fewer parameters and data requirements. Moreover, the
multi-scale context-guided module can significantly improve the performance by
6.45% and 5.51% with ResNet18 and ResNet50, respectively. Our code is available
at https://github.com/czifan/CCFNet.pytorch.

an active area of research. In practice, the behavior of autonomous vehicles
must be acceptable, i.e., efficient, safe, and interpretable. While vanilla
reinforcement learning (RL) finds performant behavioral strategies, they are
often unsafe and uninterpretable. Safety is introduced through Safe RL
approaches, but they still mostly remain uninterpretable as the learned
behaviour is jointly optimized for safety and performance without modeling them
separately. Interpretable machine learning is rarely applied to RL. This paper
proposes SafeDQN, which allows to make the behavior of autonomous vehicles safe
and interpretable while still being efficient. SafeDQN offers an
understandable, semantic trade-off between the expected risk and the utility of
actions while being algorithmically transparent. We show that SafeDQN finds
interpretable and safe driving policies for a variety of scenarios and
demonstrate how state-of-the-art saliency techniques can help to assess both
risk and utility.

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.MA cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the partial observability and communication constraints in many
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, centralized training with
decentralized execution (CTDE) has become one of the most widely used MARL
paradigms. In CTDE, centralized information is dedicated to learning the
allocation of the team reward with a mixing network, while the learning of
individual Q-values is usually based on local observations. The insufficient
utility of global observation will degrade performance in challenging
environments. To this end, this work proposes a novel Centralized Teacher with
Decentralized Student (CTDS) framework, which consists of a teacher model and a
student model. Specifically, the teacher model allocates the team reward by
learning individual Q-values conditioned on global observation, while the
student model utilizes the partial observations to approximate the Q-values
estimated by the teacher model. In this way, CTDS balances the full utilization
of global observation during training and the feasibility of decentralized
execution for online inference. Our CTDS framework is generic which is ready to
be applied upon existing CTDE methods to boost their performance. We conduct
experiments on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks to test
the effectiveness of our method and the results show that CTDS outperforms the
existing value-based MARL methods.

SVs in functions are originated in these statements. We show that vulnerable

still critical of such a vaccination or even strictly reject it. One but surely
not the only reason for this is the fear of undesired adverse effects. During
the year 2021 in Germany alone approximately 150 million vaccination doses have
been applied. This should be a solid basis to assess the risk of adverse
effects of corona vaccinations. Based on publicly available data, especially
from the German Federal Institute of Vaccines and Biomedicines
(Paul-Ehrlich-Institut) and further scientific publications from Europe, Israel
and the United States, this paper tries to give sound quantitative statements
on the risk of (severe) adverse effects (e.g. myocarditis, thrombosis and
thrombocytopenia, venous thrombosis, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
and fatalities based thereon) of the various vaccination types, i.e. Comirnaty,
Vaxzevria, Janssen and the Spikevax Covid-19 vaccine. The paper also describes
some quite serious concerns about the lack of details in the publicly available
data and the variations in the structure of reports from the primary source
that prohibit even simple time series comparisons. However, from an overarching
view all provided vaccines are pretty safe and fall mostly into the same
frequency categories with respect to various clusters of undesired
complications. Nevertheless there are statistically significant differences
amongst the four vaccines which indicate that Vaxzevria is according to some
important aspects only the second best preferable choice.
  The paper aims to support a rational approach regarding the confidence in the
widely available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines through a purely statistical investigation
of the number of adverse effects in an unbiased manner.

introduce three tailored components in our Transformer-based framework, which
are (1) a Deep Taylor Decomposition (DTD) to generate attention maps, (2) a

editing-based method, i.e., Attribute Group Editing (AGE), for few-shot image
generation. The basic assumption is that any image is a collection of
attributes and the editing direction for a specific attribute is shared across
all categories. AGE examines the internal representation learned in GANs and
identifies semantically meaningful directions. Specifically, the class
embedding, i.e., the mean vector of the latent codes from a specific category,
is used to represent the category-relevant attributes, and the
category-irrelevant attributes are learned globally by Sparse Dictionary
Learning on the difference between the sample embedding and the class
embedding. Given a GAN well trained on seen categories, diverse images of
unseen categories can be synthesized through editing category-irrelevant
attributes while keeping category-relevant attributes unchanged. Without
re-training the GAN, AGE is capable of not only producing more realistic and
diverse images for downstream visual applications with limited data but
achieving controllable image editing with interpretable category-irrelevant

would require center-of-mass energy of the order of up to 15 TeV. Since, given
reasonable space and cost restrictions, conventional accelerator technology
reaches its limits near this energy, high-gradient advanced acceleration
concepts are attractive. Advanced and novel accelerators (ANAs) are leading
candidates due to their ability to produce acceleration gradients on the order
of 1--100~GV/m, leading to compact acceleration structures. Over the last 10-15
years significant progress has been achieved in accelerating electron beams by
ANAs. For example, the demonstration of several-GeV electron beams from
laser-powered capillary discharge waveguides, as well as the proof-of-principle
coupling of two accelerating structures powered by different laser pulses, has
increased interest in ANAs as a viable technology to be considered for a
compact, TeV-class, lepton linear collider.
  However, intermediate facilities are required to test the technology and
demonstrate key subsystems. A 20-100 GeV center-of-mass energy ANA-based lepton
collider can be a possible candidate for an intermediate facility. Apart from
being a test beam facility for accelerator and detector studies, this collider
will provide opportunities to study muon and proton beam acceleration,
investigate charged particle interactions with extreme electromagnetic fields

argue that cross-language ability comes from the commonality between languages.
Specifically, we study three language properties: constituent order,

modifying property in source language. Then we study the contribution of
modified property through the change of cross-language transfer results on
target language. We conduct experiments on six languages and two cross-lingual

the contribution of constituent order and word co-occurrence is limited, while
the composition is more crucial to the success of cross-linguistic transfer.

of diverse sounds and is inferred by identifying combinations of distinct

effectively using an improved multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for
ASC. MIL, known as a weakly supervised learning method, is a strategy for
extracting an instance from a bundle of frames composing an input audio clip
and inferring a scene corresponding to the input data using these unlabeled
instances. However, many studies pointed out an underestimation problem of MIL.
In this study, we develop a MIL framework more suitable for ASC systems by
defining instance-level labels and loss to extract and cluster instances
effectively. Furthermore, we design a fully separated convolutional module,
which is a lightweight neural network comprising pointwise, frequency-sided
depthwise, and temporal-sided depthwise convolutional filters. As a result,
compared to vanilla MIL, the confidence and proportion of positive instances
increase significantly, overcoming the underestimation problem and improving

perform closed set classification. Then, an additional detection head is
attached to the embedded features extracted by the ViT, trained to force the
representations of known data to class-specific clusters compactly. Test
examples are identified as known or unknown based on their distance to the
cluster centers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to
leverage ViT for the purpose of OSR, and our extensive evaluation against

the discrepancies between Seq2Seq pretraining and NMT finetuning limit the

Prior based degradation-aware feature interpolation network, dubbed Panini-Net,
for FR tasks by explicitly learning the abstract representations to distinguish
various degradations. Specifically, an unsupervised degradation representation
learning (UDRL) strategy is first developed to extract degradation
representations (DR) of the input degraded images. Then, a degradation-aware

types of informative features (\textit{i.e.}, features from input images and
features from GAN Prior) with flexible adaption to various degradations based
on DR. Ablation studies reveal the working mechanism of DAFI and its potential

  Compression","Accepted by CVPR 2022",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learned image compression methods have exhibited superior rate-distortion
performance than classical image compression standards. Most existing learned
image compression models are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Despite great contributions, a main drawback of CNN based model is that its
structure is not designed for capturing local redundancy, especially the
non-repetitive textures, which severely affects the reconstruction quality.
Therefore, how to make full use of both global structure and local texture
becomes the core problem for learning-based image compression. Inspired by
recent progresses of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer, we found
that combining the local-aware attention mechanism with the global-related
feature learning could meet the expectation in image compression. In this
paper, we first extensively study the effects of multiple kinds of attention
mechanisms for local features learning, then introduce a more straightforward
yet effective window-based local attention block. The proposed window-based
attention is very flexible which could work as a plug-and-play component to
enhance CNN and Transformer models. Moreover, we propose a novel Symmetrical
TransFormer (STF) framework with absolute transformer blocks in the
down-sampling encoder and up-sampling decoder. Extensive experimental
evaluations have shown that the proposed method is effective and outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Nowadays, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art

interpret similes or not. In this paper, we investigate the ability of PLMs in
simile interpretation by designing a novel task named Simile Property Probing,
i.e., to let the PLMs infer the shared properties of similes. We construct our
simile property probing datasets from both general textual corpora and
human-designed questions, containing 1,633 examples covering seven main
categories. Our empirical study based on the constructed datasets shows that
PLMs can infer similes' shared properties while still underperforming humans.
To bridge the gap with human performance, we additionally design a

into PLMs via knowledge embedding methods. Our method results in a gain of
8.58% in the probing task and 1.37% in the downstream task of sentiment

sources and holds huge potential for applications, but has long been suffering
from poor power conversion efficiency when driving by a continuous-wave laser.
Here, a general approach to resolving this challenge is provided. By deriving
the critical coupling condition of a multimode nonlinear optics system in a
generalized theoretical framework, two efficiency limitations of the
conventional pump method of DKS are revealed: the effective coupling rate is
too small and is also power-dependent. Nonlinear couplers are proposed to
sustain the DKS indirectly through nonlinear energy conversion processes,
realizing a power-adaptive effective coupling rate to the DKS and matching the
total dissipation rate of the system, which promises near-unity power
conversion efficiencies. For instance, a conversion efficiency exceeding
$90\:\%$ is predicted for aluminum nitride microrings with a nonlinear coupler
utilizing second-harmonic generation. The nonlinear coupler approach for
high-efficiency generation of DKS is experimentally feasible as its mechanism
applies to various nonlinear processes, including Raman and Brillouin
scattering, and thus paves the way of micro-solitons towards practical
applications.

which is partially due to the gap between the simulated and real-world

that the agents can work normally all the time, while in practice, one or more
agents may unexpectedly ""crash"" during the coordination process due to
inevitable hardware or software failures. Such crashes will destroy the
cooperation among agents, leading to performance degradation. In this work, we
present a formal formulation of a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
learning system with unexpected crashes. To enhance the robustness of the
system to crashes, we propose a coach-assisted multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework, which introduces a virtual coach agent to adjust the crash
rate during training. We design three coaching strategies and the re-sampling
strategy for our coach agent. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to study the unexpected crashes in the multi-agent system. Extensive
experiments on grid-world and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of adaptive strategy compared with the fixed crash rate strategy
and curriculum learning strategy. The ablation study further illustrates the
effectiveness of our re-sampling strategy.

challenging task of large-scale conditional generative adversarial networks

(PPCD-GAN) by introducing progressive pruning residual block (PP-Res) and

residual block where each convolutional layer is followed by a learnable mask
layer to progressively prune network parameters as training proceeds. The
class-aware distillation, on the other hand, enhances the stability of training
by transferring immense knowledge from a well-trained teacher model through
instructive attention maps. We train the pruning and distillation processes
simultaneously on a well-known GAN architecture in an end-to-end manner. After
training, all redundant parameters as well as the mask layers are discarded,
yielding a lighter network while retaining the performance. We comprehensively
illustrate, on ImageNet 128x128 dataset, PPCD-GAN reduces up to 5.2x (81%)
parameters against state-of-the-arts while keeping better performance.

predictive control (DR-SMPC) algorithm to address the problem of two-sided

prevalent mechanism to cope with two-sided chance constraints is the so-called
risk allocation approach, which conservatively approximates the two-sided
chance constraints with two single chance constraints by applying the Boole's
inequality. In this proposed DR-SMPC framework, an exact tractable second-order
cone (SOC) approach is adopted to abstract the two-sided chance constraints by
considering the first and second moments of the noise. The proposed DR-SMPC
algorithm is able to guarantee that the worst-case probability of violating
both the upper and lower limits of safety constraints is within the
pre-specified maximum probability (PsMP). By flexibly adjusting this PsMP, the
feasible region of the initial states can be increased for the SMPC problem.
The recursive feasibility and convergence of the proposed DR-SMPC are
established rigorously by introducing binary initialization strategy of nominal
state. Simulation studies of two practical cases are conducted to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed DR-SMPC algorithm.

Groth Strip (EGS) field, and lies physically close (3.5 physical Mpc [pMpc]) to
another confirmed galaxy in this field with Ly$\alpha$ detected at z=8.683
(Zitrin et al. 2015). The detection of Ly$\alpha$ suggests the existence of
large (~1 pMpc) ionized bubbles fairly early in the reionization process. We
explore the ionizing output needed to create bubbles of this size at this epoch
and find that such a bubble requires more than the ionizing power provided by
the full expected population of galaxies (by integrating the UV Luminosity
Function down to M_UV = -13). The Ly$\alpha$ we detect would be able to escape
the predominantly-neutral intergalactic medium at this epoch if our galaxy is
inhabiting an overdensity, which would be consistent with the photometric
overdensity previously identified in this region by Finkelstein et al. 2021.
This implies that the CANDELS EGS field is hosting an overdensity at z = 8.7

The experienced-based scenarios are forecasted to probe many square decades of

decades in mass: 1-100 eV/c$^2$ for dark photons and axion-like particles,
1-100 MeV/c$^2$ for dark-photon-coupled light dark matter, and 0.05-5 GeV/c$^2$
for nucleon-coupled dark matter. They will reach the neutrino fog in the 0.5-5
GeV/c$^2$ mass range and test a variety of benchmark models and sharp targets.
The novel directions involve greater departures from current SuperCDMS
technology but promise even greater reach in the long run, and their
development must begin now for them to be available in a timely fashion.
  The experienced-based upgrade scenarios rely mainly on dramatic improvements
in detector performance based on demonstrated scaling laws and reasonable
extrapolations of current performance. Importantly, these improvements in
detector performance obviate significant reductions in background levels beyond
current expectations for the SuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment. Given that the
dominant limiting backgrounds for SuperCDMS SNOLAB are cosmogenically created
radioisotopes in the detectors, likely amenable only to isotopic purification
and an underground detector life-cycle from before crystal growth to detector
testing, the potential cost and time savings are enormous and the necessary
improvements much easier to prototype.

way is so stringent that it would exclude any discovery of $n-n'$ oscillation
in the currently planned terrestrial experiments at various laboratories. This
conclusion motivated us to critically analyze this suggestion in more detail.
In this note, we point out a very interesting new effect present in nearly
exact mirror models, which can significantly affect this bound. The new element
is that in nearly exact mirror models there is the mirror analog of $\beta$
decay, i.e. $n' \to p' + e' + \bar\nu'_e$, which creates a cloud of mirror
particles $n'$, $p'$, $e'$, $D'$ and He$'$ inside the NS. The resulting $e'$
can ""rob"" the energy generated by the $n \to n'$ transition from the NS, via
$e-e'$ scattering enabled by the presence of a (minute) millicharge in mirror
particles. Such a tiny millicharge on mirror particles is highly likely in
these models. This results in energy being emitted as unobserved mirror photons
via fast mirror bremsstrahlung, whose effect is to relax the stringent bounds
on $\epsilon_{nn'}$.

misspecified prior (whenever the adopted prior does not match the actual
distribution of physical objects). We find that the Bayesian and frequentist

formal advantage if the frequency prior is nonuniform, but this results in only
$\sim 1$ per cent extra detected signals. In case if the prior was misspecified

stellar-mass black holes (BHs). In the last decade, some of these objects have
been potentially uncovered via gravitational microlensing events. All these
detections resulted in a degeneracy between the velocity and the mass of the
lens. This degeneracy has been lifted, for the first time, with the recent
astrometric microlensing detection of OB110462. However, two independent
studies reported very different lens mass for this event. Sahu et al. (2022)
inferred a lens mass of 7.1 $\pm$ 1.3 Msun, consistent with a BH, while Lam et
al. (2022) inferred 1.6-4.2 Msun, consistent with either a neutron star or a
BH. Here, we study the landscape of isolated BHs formed in the field. In
particular, we focus on the mass and center-of-mass speed of four
sub-populations: isolated BHs from single-star origin, disrupted BHs of
binary-star origin, main-sequence stars with a compact object companion, and
double compact object mergers. Our model predicts that most ($\gtrsim$ 70%)
isolated BHs in the Milky Way are of binary origin. However, non-interactions
lead to most massive BHs ($\gtrsim$ 15-20 Msun) being predominantly of single
origin. Under the assumption that OB110462 is a free-floating compact object we
conclude that it is more likely to be a BH originally belonging to a binary
system. Our results suggest that low-mass BH microlensing events can be useful
to understand binary evolution of massive stars in the Milky Way, while
high-mass BH lenses can be useful to probe single stellar evolution.

mutual information between the source and the translated images across
different domains, which is critical for the generator to keep the source
content and prevent it from unnecessary modifications. The self-supervised
contrastive learning has already been successfully applied in the I2I. By
constraining features from the same location to be closer than those from
different ones, it implicitly ensures the result to take content from the
source. However, previous work uses the features from random locations to
impose the constraint, which may not be appropriate since some locations
contain less information of source domain. Moreover, the feature itself does
not reflect the relation with others. This paper deals with these problems by
intentionally selecting significant anchor points for contrastive learning. We
design a query-selected attention (QS-Attn) module, which compares feature
distances in the source domain, giving an attention matrix with a probability
distribution in each row. Then we select queries according to their measurement
of significance, computed from the distribution. The selected ones are regarded
as anchors for contrastive loss. At the same time, the reduced attention matrix
is employed to route features in both domains, so that source relations
maintain in the synthesis. We validate our proposed method in three different
I2I datasets, showing that it increases the image quality without adding
learnable parameters.

propose a digital synchronization procedure for a modern CV-QKD system with
locally generated local oscillator for coherent reception. Our proposed method
is modulation format independent allowing it to be used in a variety of CV-QKD
systems. We experimentally investigate its performance with a Gaussian
modulated CV-QKD system operating over a 10-20 km span of standard single mode
fibre. Since the procedure does not require hardware modifications it paves the
way for cost-effective QKD solutions that can adapt rapidly to changing
environmental conditions.

our previous result obtained in the case of minimal affine $W$-algebras. We
also find a sufficient condition showing that certain conformal levels are

$W_k(sl(N), x, f )$ collapses to its affine part when $f$ is of hook or

subalgebra. Quite surprisingly, the problem of showing that certain conformal
levels are not collapsing turns out to be very difficult. In the cases when $k$

surface in their interior, the Cauchy horizon, beyond which the evolution of

field on the Cauchy horizon inside a rotating (Kerr) black hole that is
evaporating via the emission of Hawking radiation (corresponding to the field
being in the Unruh state). We calculate the flux components (in Eddington
coordinates) of the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the field on the
Cauchy horizon, as functions of the black hole spin and of the polar angle. We
find that these flux components are generically non-vanishing. Furthermore, we
find that the flux components change sign as these parameters vary. The signs
of the fluxes are important, as they provide an indication of whether the
Cauchy horizon expands or crushes (when backreaction is taken into account).
Regardless of these signs, our results imply that the flux components
generically diverge on the Cauchy horizon when expressed in coordinates which
are regular there. This is the first time that irregularity of the Cauchy

underlying presumptions. First, the target task is predefined and static; a
system merely needs to learn to solve it exclusively. Second, the supervision
of a task mainly comes from a set of labeled examples. A question arises: how
to build a system that can keep learning new tasks from their instructions?
This work defines a new learning paradigm ConTinTin (Continual Learning from
Task Instructions), in which a system should learn a sequence of new tasks one
by one, each task is explained by a piece of textual instruction. The system is
required to (i) generate the expected outputs of a new task by learning from
its instruction, (ii) transfer the knowledge acquired from upstream tasks to
help solve downstream tasks (i.e., forward-transfer), and (iii) retain or even
improve the performance on earlier tasks after learning new tasks (i.e.,
backward-transfer). This new problem is studied on a stream of more than 60
tasks, each equipped with an instruction. Technically, our method
InstructionSpeak contains two strategies that make full use of task
instructions to improve forward-transfer and backward-transfer: one is to learn
from negative outputs, the other is to re-visit instructions of previous tasks.
To our knowledge, this is the first time to study ConTinTin in NLP. In addition
to the problem formulation and our promising approach, this work also
contributes to providing rich analyses for the community to better understand
this novel learning problem.

circuits into parameterized ansatzes utilizing a hybrid quantum-classical
approach. In this article a variant of VQC named the recursive variational
quantum compiling algorithm (RVQC) is proposed. In contrast with existing VQC
algorithms, where one is required to execute the full target circuit in order
to compile it, RVQC works by dividing the target circuit into $N$ parts and
recursively compresses one part at a time into the parameterized ansatz. Since
smaller parts are being compressed at a time, the circuit depth required to
implement the algorithm is not dependent on the depth of the target circuit,
but on the depth of the ansatz and the depth of each of the $N$ parts. We are
hence able to compress the target circuit by executing circuits of smaller
depths than the target circuit itself. To show that this approach has an edge
over the standard VQC method for sufficiently large circuit depths, RVQC was
compared with VQC on a noise model of the IBM Santiago device with the goal of
compressing a randomly generated five-qubit circuit of depth 5000. It was shown
that VQC was not able to converge within 500 epochs of training. On the other
hand, RVQC was able to converge to a fidelity ($0.88$) within a total of 500
epochs when splitting the target circuit into $N = 5$ parts.

enabled various image generation and manipulation tasks due to its rich and
disentangled latent spaces. The discovery of such directions is typically done
either in a supervised manner, which requires annotated data for each desired
manipulation or in an unsupervised manner, which requires a manual effort to
identify the directions. As a result, existing work typically finds only a
handful of directions in which controllable edits can be made. In this study,
we design a novel submodular framework that finds the most representative and
diverse subset of directions in the latent space of StyleGAN2. Our approach
takes advantage of the latent space of channel-wise style parameters, so-called
style space, in which we cluster channels that perform similar manipulations
into groups. Our framework promotes diversity by using the notion of clusters
and can be efficiently solved with a greedy optimization scheme. We evaluate
our framework with qualitative and quantitative experiments and show that our

modifying pixels arbitrarily in a continuous region. Certifiable patch defense
can guarantee robustness that the classifier is not affected by patch attacks.
Existing certifiable patch defenses sacrifice the clean accuracy of classifiers
and only obtain a low certified accuracy on toy datasets. Furthermore, the
clean and certified accuracy of these methods is still significantly lower than
the accuracy of normal classification networks, which limits their application
in practice. To move towards a practical certifiable patch defense, we
introduce Vision Transformer (ViT) into the framework of Derandomized Smoothing
(DS). Specifically, we propose a progressive smoothed image modeling task to
train Vision Transformer, which can capture the more discriminable local
context of an image while preserving the global semantic information. For
efficient inference and deployment in the real world, we innovatively
reconstruct the global self-attention structure of the original ViT into
isolated band unit self-attention. On ImageNet, under 2% area patch attacks our
method achieves 41.70% certified accuracy, a nearly 1-fold increase over the
previous best method (26.00%). Simultaneously, our method achieves 78.58% clean

this paper, we propose to address this phenomenon by expanding the UniMorph
annotation schema to a hierarchical feature structure that naturally
accommodates complex argument marking. We apply this extended schema to one
such language, Georgian, and provide a human-verified, accurate and balanced
morphological dataset for Georgian verbs. The dataset has 4 times more tables
and 6 times more verb forms compared to the existing UniMorph dataset, covering
all possible variants of argument marking, demonstrating the adequacy of our
proposed scheme. Experiments with a standard reinflection model show that
generalization is easy when the data is split at the form level, but extremely
hard when splitting along lemma lines. Expanding the other languages in
UniMorph to this schema is expected to improve both the coverage, consistency

two sectors: The Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We can impose the
gauge conditions to fix the (super-) reparametrization invariance on the

address this problem, we propose a motion pose and shape network (MPS-Net) to
effectively capture humans in motion to estimate accurate and temporally
coherent 3D human pose and shape from a video. Specifically, we first propose a
motion continuity attention (MoCA) module that leverages visual cues observed
from human motion to adaptively recalibrate the range that needs attention in
the sequence to better capture the motion continuity dependencies. Then, we
develop a hierarchical attentive feature integration (HAFI) module to
effectively combine adjacent past and future feature representations to
strengthen temporal correlation and refine the feature representation of the
current frame. By coupling the MoCA and HAFI modules, the proposed MPS-Net
excels in estimating 3D human pose and shape in the video. Though conceptually
simple, our MPS-Net not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the

flavour and CP symmetry and residual groups, this matrix has five real free

mixing, while $\theta_R$ is related to right-handed neutrinos. We scrutinise
for all four lepton mixing patterns, grouped into Case 1) through Case 3 b.1),
the potential to generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) through
low-scale leptogenesis numerically and analytically. The main results are: a)
the possible correlation of the BAU and the Majorana phases of the PMNS mixing
matrix in certain instances; b) the possibility to generate the correct amount
of BAU for zero $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ as well as for large $\kappa$, depending
on the case and choice of group theory parameters; c) the chance to produce
sufficient BAU for large active-sterile mixing angles, enabling direct
experimental tests at current and future facilities, for $\theta_R$ close to a
special value, potentially protected by an enhanced residual symmetry. We
elucidate these results with representative examples of flavour and CP
symmetries, which all lead to a good agreement with the measured lepton mixing
angles and, possibly, the current hint of the CP phase $\delta$. We identify
the CP-violating combinations relevant for low-scale leptogenesis, and show

optimally for an artificial agent. We argue that deciding when to act is
equally important. As humans, we drift from default, instinctive or memorized
behaviors to focused, thought-out behaviors when required by the situation. To
enhance RL agents with this aptitude, we propose to augment the standard Markov
Decision Process and make a new mode of action available: being lazy, which
defers decision-making to a default policy. In addition, we penalize non-lazy
actions in order to encourage minimal effort and have agents focus on critical
decisions only. We name the resulting formalism lazy-MDPs. We study the
theoretical properties of lazy-MDPs, expressing value functions and
characterizing optimal solutions. Then we empirically demonstrate that policies
learned in lazy-MDPs generally come with a form of interpretability: by
construction, they show us the states where the agent takes control over the
default policy. We deem those states and corresponding actions important since
they explain the difference in performance between the default and the new,
lazy policy. With suboptimal policies as default (pretrained or random), we
observe that agents are able to get competitive performance in Atari games
while only taking control in a limited subset of states.

us to see black holes and neutron stars further into the universe and recent
results represent the most sensitive searches for compact objects ever

coalescence currently rely on detecting coincident triggers from multiple
detectors. In this paper, we describe a new method for extrapolating
significance of single-detector signals beyond the live-time of the analysis.
Using this method, we can recover loud signals which only triggered in a single
detector. We demonstrate this method in a search of O3 data, and recover seven
single-detector events with a false alarm rate less than two per year. These
were the same events as discovered in the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 searches in a
single detector, and all but one event from 3-OGC and 4-OGC. Through a campaign
of injected signals, we estimate that the total time--volume sensitivity
increases by a factor of up to $1.20 \pm 0.02$ at a false alarm rate of one per
two years compared to completely ignoring single-detector events.

semantic relations can simply be expressed through predefined distance metrics.
Best performing approaches commonly leverage class proxies as sample stand-ins
for better convergence and generalization. However, these proxy-methods solely
optimize for sample-proxy distances. Given the inherent non-bijectiveness of
used distance functions, this can induce locally isotropic sample
distributions, leading to crucial semantic context being missed due to
difficulties resolving local structures and intraclass relations between
samples. To alleviate this problem, we propose non-isotropy regularization
($\mathbb{NIR}$) for proxy-based Deep Metric Learning. By leveraging
Normalizing Flows, we enforce unique translatability of samples from their
respective class proxies. This allows us to explicitly induce a non-isotropic
distribution of samples around a proxy to optimize for. In doing so, we equip
proxy-based objectives to better learn local structures. Extensive experiments
highlight consistent generalization benefits of $\mathbb{NIR}$ while achieving
competitive and state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmarks
CUB200-2011, Cars196 and Stanford Online Products. In addition, we find the
superior convergence properties of proxy-based methods to still be retained or
even improved, making $\mathbb{NIR}$ very attractive for practical usage. Code

today must be smaller than $m_\phi\simeq 10^{-33}$ eV. If $m_\phi \gtrsim

Geoadaptation is an intermediate training step that couples language modeling

EDTER works in two stages. In Stage I, a global transformer encoder is used to
capture long-range global context on coarse-grained image patches. Then in
Stage II, a local transformer encoder works on fine-grained patches to excavate
the short-range local cues. Each transformer encoder is followed by an
elaborately designed Bi-directional Multi-Level Aggregation decoder to achieve
high-resolution features. Finally, the global context and local cues are

for zero-shot and few-shot learning DST, where a large pre-trained language
model (LM) takes a test instance and a few exemplars as input, and directly
decodes the dialogue state without any parameter updates. To better leverage a
tabular domain description in the LM prompt, we reformulate DST into a
text-to-SQL problem. We also propose a novel approach to retrieve annotated
dialogues as exemplars. Empirical results on MultiWOZ show that our method
IC-DST substantially outperforms previous fine-tuned state-of-the-art models in
few-shot settings. In addition, we test IC-DST in zero-shot settings, in which
the model only takes a fixed task instruction as input, finding that it
outperforms previous zero-shot methods by a large margin.

Besides recognizing
predefined classes, the system needs to reject the unknowns. Prototype learning
is a potential manner to handle the problem, as its ability to improve
intra-class compactness of representations is much needed in discrimination
between the known and the unknowns. In this work, we propose a novel Prototype
Mining And Learning (PMAL) framework. It has a prototype mining mechanism
before the phase of optimizing embedding space, explicitly considering two
crucial properties, namely high-quality and diversity of the prototype set.
Concretely, a set of high-quality candidates are firstly extracted from
training samples based on data uncertainty learning, avoiding the interference
from unexpected noise. Considering the multifarious appearance of objects even
in a single category, a diversity-based strategy for prototype set filtering is
proposed. Accordingly, the embedding space can be better optimized to
discriminate therein the predefined classes and between known and unknowns.
Extensive experiments verify the two good characteristics (i.e., high-quality
and diversity) embraced in prototype mining, and show the remarkable
performance of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-arts.

the potential for targeted interventions. It is, however, hard to infer these

shift where the data (outcome) conditional distribution remains the same but
the covariate (input) distribution changes between the training and test set.
In an observational data setting, this problem is materialised in control and
treated units coming from different distributions. A common solution is to
augment learning methods through reweighing schemes (e.g. propensity scores).
These are needed due to model misspecification, but might hurt performance in
the individual case. In this paper, we explore a novel generative tree based
approach that tackles model misspecification directly, helping downstream
estimators achieve better robustness. We show empirically that the choice of

reweighing methods can struggle in individualised effect estimation. Our

the field of cellular signal processing has advanced rapidly in recent years.
In this context, each signal on the cells of a complex is processed using the
combinatorial Laplacian, and the resultant Hodge decomposition. Meanwhile,
discrete Morse theory has been widely used to speed up computations by reducing
the size of complexes while preserving their global topological properties. In
this paper, we provide an approach to signal compression and reconstruction on
chain complexes that leverages the tools of algebraic discrete Morse theory.
The main goal is to reduce and reconstruct a based chain complex together with
a set of signals on its cells via deformation retracts, preserving as much as
possible the global topological structure of both the complex and the signals.
We first prove that any deformation retract of real degree-wise
finite-dimensional based chain complexes is equivalent to a Morse matching. We
will then study how the signal changes under particular types of Morse
matching, showing its reconstruction error is trivial on specific components of
the Hodge decomposition. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to compute Morse
matchings with minimal reconstruction error.

techniques that sacrifice the array aperture, or adopt the sparsity constraint
and utilize compressed sensing (CS) method by defining prior grids and
resulting in the off-grid problem. Recently emerged atomic norm minimization
(ANM) methods achieved gridless SMV line spectrum estimation, but its
computational complexity is extremely high; thus it is practically infeasible
in real applications with large problem scales. Our proposed GDLS method
reformulates the line spectrum estimations problem into a least squares (LS)

discussed in this paper. Numerical simulations and real data experiments show
that the proposed GDLS algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods e.g.,

that contemporary spoken language systems already require training data sets

smaller than -3, this anomalous scaling does not take place: this indicates
that the processes only fluctuate around the expectation with an error that is
compatible with a standard large deviation scaling. In this case, we argue that
anomalous scaling appears in higher order cumulants. Finally, many-body

find that the distribution of counter-propagating supercurrents aligned in

maxima of the Fraunhofer pattern. Instead, when the magnetic field drives the
junction to a supercurrent minimum in the Fraunhofer pattern, the
superconducting phase adapts, and the tip always increases the supercurrent.
The perpendicular magnetic field leads to the formation of Josephson vortices,
whose extension for highly transparent junctions depends on the current
circulation direction. We show that this leads to an asymmetric supercurrent

located at the Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden. With dual linear polarized
broad-band (3-14 GHz) receivers, they are part of the next generation Very Long
Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Global Observing System (VGOS) for geodesy and
astrometry. In addition to purely geodetic data products, VGOS will regularly
produce full-polarisation images of hundreds of radio sources. These rich
monitoring data will be valuable for both astronomy and geodesy. In this pilot
study we aim to monitor 10 bright radio sources to search for flares or similar
activity, and to verify the instrument calibration on long (months) and short
(hours) time scales. Method: We observed and analysed 91 short (<30 min)
sessions spanning 7 months. We monitored seven potentially variable radio
sources (0059+581, 0552+398, 1144+402, 1156+295, 1617+229, 3C418, OJ287) and
three reference calibrators (3C147, 3C286, 3C295). We used the Common Astronomy
Software Applications (CASA) package to fringe-fit, bandpass-correct and scale
the data to obtain flux densities in the four standard VGOS bands: 3.0-3.5 GHz
(band 1), 5.2-5.7 GHz (band 2), 6.3-6.8 GHz (band 3), and 10.2-10.7 GHz (band
4). Results: We obtain simultaneous multi-frequency light curves for ten radio
sources. A bright multi-frequency flare is observed in the radio source
0059+581. OJ287 and 1156+295 show significant long-term variability.
Conclusions: After correcting for instrumental biases, we determine the
empirical flux density uncertainty as $\sim$5%. Future refined analysis methods
will allow regular monitoring of more and fainter sources.

order to fit the linear waves from quantum kinetic theory in the long
wavelength limit. Moreover, the equation of state for the ideal Fermi gas is
assumed, for arbitrary degeneracy degree. The quantum fluid equations allow the
expedite derivation of weakly nonlinear equations from reductive perturbation
theory. In this way, quantum Korteweg - de Vries and quantum Zakharov -
Kuznetsov equations are derived, together with the conditions for bright and

target node are fundamental operators for querying and processing graph data.
Current approaches for index-based evaluation of reachability queries either
focus on plain reachability or constraint-based reachability with alternation
only. In this paper, for the first time we study the problem of index-based
processing for recursive label-concatenated reachability queries, referred to
as RLC queries. These queries check the existence of a path that can satisfy
the constraint defined by a concatenation of at most k edge labels under the
Kleene plus. Many practical graph database and network analysis applications
exhibit RLC queries. However, their evaluation remains prohibitive in current
graph database engines.
  We introduce the RLC index, the first reachability index to efficiently
process RLC queries. The RLC index checks whether the source vertex can reach
an intermediate vertex that can also reach the target vertex under a recursive
label-concatenated constraint. We propose an indexing algorithm to build the
RLC index, which guarantees the soundness and the completeness of query
execution and avoids recording redundant index entries. Comprehensive
experiments on real-world graphs show that the RLC index can significantly
reduce both the offline processing cost and the memory overhead of transitive
closure while improving query processing up to six orders of magnitude over
online traversals. Finally, our open-source implementation of the RLC index
significantly outperforms current mainstream graph engines for evaluating RLC
queries.

consider an idealised model for job parallelism in which a job can be served
simultaneously by $d$ distinct servers. The job is considered complete when the
total amount of work done on it by the $d$ servers equals its size. We study
the effect of parallelism on the average delay of jobs. Specifically, we
analyze a system consisting of $n$ parallel processor sharing servers in which
jobs arrive according to a Poisson process of rate $n \lambda$ ($\lambda <1$)
and each job brings an exponentially distributed amount of work with unit mean.
Upon arrival, a job selects $d$ servers uniformly at random and joins all the
chosen servers simultaneously. We show by a mean-field analysis that, for fixed
$d \geq 2$ and large $n$, the average occupancy of servers is $O(\log
(1/(1-\lambda)))$ as $\lambda \to 1$ in comparison to $O(1/(1-\lambda))$
average occupancy for $d=1$. Thus, we obtain an exponential reduction in the
response time of jobs through parallelism. We make significant progress towards

helps to design applications that meet users' needs, including scientific and
technological information recommendation, personalized scientific and

to learn a common subspace, so that data from different media can be directly
compared with each other after being mapped into this subspace. In subspace
learning, existing methods often focus on modeling the discrimination of
intra-media data and the invariance of inter-media data after mapping; however,
they ignore the semantic consistency of inter-media data before and after
mapping and media discrimination of intra-semantics data, which limit the
result of cross-media retrieval. In light of this, we propose a scientific and
technological information oriented Semantics-adversarial and Media-adversarial
Cross-media Retrieval method (SMCR) to find an effective common subspace.
Specifically, SMCR minimizes the loss of inter-media semantic consistency in
addition to modeling intra-media semantic discrimination, to preserve semantic
similarity before and after mapping. Furthermore, SMCR constructs a basic
feature mapping network and a refined feature mapping network to jointly
minimize the media discriminative loss within semantics, so as to enhance the
feature mapping network's ability to confuse the media discriminant network.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed SMCR
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-media retrieval.

sequential Monte Carlo methods. Recent advances in differentiable particle
filters have led to various efforts to learn measurement models through neural
networks. But existing approaches in the differentiable particle filter
framework do not admit valid probability densities in constructing measurement
models, leading to incorrect quantification of the measurement uncertainty
given state information. We propose to learn expressive and valid probability
densities in measurement models through conditional normalizing flows, to
capture the complex likelihood of measurements given states. We show that the
proposed approach leads to improved estimation performance and faster training

learns motion primitives. The proposed method was experimentally compared to
hierarchical RNN-based methods to validate its effectiveness. Consequently, the

and subsequent evolution of these grains are currently unconstrained. Using 3D,
gas-dust simulations, we find that isotopic variations on the order of those
observed in the solar system can be generated and maintained by drag and
viscosity. Small grains are dragged radially outwards without size/density
sorting by viscous expansion and backreaction, enriching the outer disc with
presolar grains. Meanwhile large aggregates composed primarily of silicates
drift radially inwards due to drag, further enriching the relative portion of
presolar grains in the outer disc and diluting the inner disc. The late
accumulation of enriched aggregates outside Jupiter could explain some of the
isotopic variations observed in solar system bodies, such as the enrichment of
supernovae derived material in carbonaceous chondrites. We also see evidence
for isotopic variations in the inner disc that may hold implications for
enstatite and ordinary chondrites that formed closer to the Sun. Initial
heterogeneities in the presolar grain distribution that are not continuously
reinforced are dispersed by diffusion, radial surface flows, and/or planetary
interactions over the entire lifetime of the disc. For younger, more massive
discs we expect turbulent diffusion to be even more homogenising, suggesting
that dust evolution played a more central role in forming the isotopic
anomalies in the solar system than originally thought.

both cases, we find strong and principled evidence against early rupture

occurs once half of the rupture has been observed. Even then, it is impossible
to foresee future asperities. Our results hint towards a universal initiation

feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in both temperature and
cloud structure, as modeled for the first time in three dimensions. Silicate

their inability to concurrently operate at multiple carrier frequencies, which

minimizing leakage to non-intended neighboring UEs. Numerical results and

emergence of excitability in large populations remains an open problem. Here,
we show that the mechanism of excitability in large networks and mean-field

arrangement, e.g., that corresponding to chemical formulas (bonds or atoms), is
low although being often maximal. Like in valence bond theory, it is useful to
consider alternative distributions of the electrons. Exchanges of electrons
should be considered not only between atoms, but also between other types of
regions, like those attributed to lone pairs. It is useful to have definitions
flexible enough to allow the user to find the reference representations he
considers most relevant. We tentatively suggest a tool (the effective number of
parties) to help one make the choice.

simplest models describing electron-phonon interactions in condensed matter. A
naive extrapolation of perturbation theory in powers of the relevant
dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\lambda_0$ suggests that at zero
temperature the model exhibits a Pomeranchuk instability characterized by a
divergent uniform compressibility at a critical value of $\lambda_0$ of order
unity. In this work, we re-examine this problem using modern functional
renormalization group (RG) methods. For dimensions $d > 3$ we find that the RG
flow of the Holstein model indeed exhibits a tricritical fixed point associated
with a Pomeranchuk instability. This non-Gaussian fixed point is ultraviolet
stable and is closely related to the well-known ultraviolet stable fixed point
of $\phi^3$-theory above six dimensions. To realize the Pomeranchuk critical
point in the Holstein model at fixed density both the electron-phonon coupling
$\lambda_0$ and the adiabatic ratio $\omega_0 / \epsilon_F$ have to be
fine-tuned to assume critical values of order unity, where $\omega_0$ is the
phonon frequency and $\epsilon_F$ is the Fermi energy. On the other hand, for
dimensions $d \leq 3$ we find that the RG flow of the Holstein model does not
have any critical fixed points. This rules out a quantum critical point
associated with a Pomeranchuk instability in $d \leq 3$.

studied the commonly accepted presumption that the Alfv\'enic turbulence is

In the conditions typical for the low-beta solar corona and inner solar wind,
we launched two counter-propagating AWs in the three-dimensional simulation box
and analyzed polarization and spectral properties of perturbations generated
before and after AW collisions. The observed post-collisional perturbations
have different polarizations and smaller cross-field scales than the original
waves, which supports theoretical scenarios with direct turbulent cascades.
However, contrary to theoretical expectations, the spectral transport is
strongly suppressed at the scales satisfying the classic critical balance of
incompressional MHD. Instead, a modified critical balance can be established by
colliding AWs with significantly shorter perpendicular scales. We discuss
consequences of these effects for the turbulence dynamics and turbulent heating
of compressional plasmas. In particular, solar coronal loops can be heated by
the strong turbulent cascade if the characteristic widths of the loop
substructures are more than ten times smaller than the loop width. The revealed
new properties of AW collisions have to be incorporated in the theoretical
models of AW turbulence and related applications.

from interactions between GRB outflow and circumburst medium, while their
evolution follows the behaviors of relativistic shock waves. Assuming the
distribution of circumburst medium follows a general power-law form, that is,
$n = A_{\ast} R^{-k}$, where $R$ denotes the distance from the burst, it is
obvious that the value of density-distribution index $k$ can affect the
behaviors of the afterglow. In this paper, we analyze the temporal and spectral
behaviors of GRB radio afterglows with arbitrary $k$-values. In the radio band,
a standard GRB afterglow produced by forward shock exhibits a late-time flux
peak, and the relative peak fluxes as well as peak times at different
frequencies show dependencies on $k$. Thus with multi-band radio peak
observations, one can determine the density profile of circumburst medium by
comparing the relations between peak flux/time and frequency at each observing
band. Also, the effects of trans-relativistic shock waves, as well as jets in
afterglows are discussed. By analyzing 31 long and 1 short GRBs with multi-band
data of radio afterglows, we find that nearly half of them can be explained
with uniform interstellar medium ($k=0$), $\sim 1/5$ can be constrained to

that aims to recover objects or scene parts outside the field of view from
measurements of light that is indirectly scattered off a directly visible,
diffuse wall. Despite recent advances in acquisition and reconstruction
techniques, the well-posedness of the problem at large, and the recoverability
of objects and their shapes in particular, remains an open question. The
commonly employed Fermat path criterion is rather conservative with this
regard, as it classifies some surfaces as unrecoverable, although they
contribute to the signal.
  In this paper, we use a simpler necessary criterion for an opaque surface
patch to be recoverable. Such piece of surface must be directly visible from
some point on the wall, and it must occlude the space behind itself. Inspired
by recent advances in neural implicit representations, we devise a new
representation and reconstruction technique for NLoS scenes that unifies the
treatment of recoverability with the reconstruction itself. Our approach, which
we validate on various synthetic and experimental datasets, exhibits
interesting properties. Unlike memory-inefficient volumetric representations,
ours allows to infer adaptively tessellated surfaces from time-of-flight
measurements of moderate resolution. It can further recover features beyond the
Fermat path criterion, and it is robust to significant amounts of
self-occlusion. We believe that this is the first time that these properties
have been achieved in one system that, as an additional benefit, is trainable
and hence suited for data-driven approaches.

one exists and scalable design procedures to achieve maximum time to failure or
minimal unserved energy in the case of unfeasible aggregated demand profiles.
Finally, a time-domain characterization of the set of feasible demand profiles
using aggregate constraints is proposed, suitable for optimization problems
where the aggregate population behaviour is of interest.

  Astronomical Journal",,"10.2298/SAJ210915001M",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Galaxy flybys, interactions where two independent halos inter-penetrate but
detach at a later time and do not merge, occur frequently at lower redshifts.
These interactions can significantly impact the evolution of individual
galaxies - from the mass loss and shape transformation to the emergence of
tidal features and formation of morphological disc structures. The main focus
of this paper is on the dark matter mass loss of the secondary, intruder
galaxy, with the goal of determining a functional relationship between the
impact parameter and dark matter mass loss. Series of N-body simulations of
typical galaxy flybys (10:1 mass ratio) with differing impact parameters show
that the dark matter halo leftover mass of the intruder galaxy follows a
logarithmic growth law with impact parameter, regardless of the way the total
halo mass is estimated. The lost mass then, clearly, follows the exponential
decay law. The stellar component stretches faster as the impact parameter
decreases, following the exponential decay law with impact parameter.
Functional dependence on impact parameter in all cases seems universal, but the
fitting parameters are likely sensitive to the interaction parameters and
initial conditions (e.g. the mass ratio of interacting galaxies, initial
relative velocity of the intruder galaxy, interaction duration). While typical
flybys, investigated here, could not be the sole culprit behind the formation
of ultra-diffuse or dark matter deficient galaxies, they can still contribute
significantly. Rare, atypical and stronger flybys are worth further exploring.

tackle these problems, we propose Graph Flow, a comprehensive knowledge

integrating the adversarial distillation and the vanilla logits distillation,

different teacher networks (conventional convolutional architecture or
prevalent transformer architecture) and student networks, we conduct extensive

exposures on an outcome, typically using summary statistics of genetic variant
associations. However, exposures of interest in Mendelian randomization
applications will often be measured with error. The summary statistics will
therefore not be of the genetic associations with the exposure, but with the
exposure measured with error. Classical measurement error will not bias genetic
association estimates but will increase their standard errors. With a single
exposure, this will result in bias toward the null in a two sample framework.
However, this will not necessarily be the case with multiple correlated
exposures. In this paper, we examine how the direction and size of bias, as
well as coverage, power and type I error rates in multivariable Mendelian
randomization studies are affected by measurement error on exposures. We show
how measurement error can be accounted for in a maximum likelihood framework.
We consider two applied examples. In the first, we show that measurement error
leads to the effect of body mass index on coronary heart disease risk to be
overestimated, and that of waist-to-hip ratio to be underestimated. In the
second, we show that the proportion of the effect of education on coronary
heart disease risk which is mediated by body mass index, smoking and blood
pressure may be underestimated if measurement error is not taken into account.

assume the attacker injects fake clients to a federated learning system and
sends carefully crafted fake local model updates to the cloud server during
training, such that the learnt global model has low accuracy for many
indiscriminate test inputs. Towards this goal, our attack drags the global
model towards an attacker-chosen base model that has low accuracy.
Specifically, in each round of federated learning, the fake clients craft fake
local model updates that point to the base model and scale them up to amplify
their impact before sending them to the cloud server. Our experiments show that
MPAF can significantly decrease the test accuracy of the global model, even if
classical defenses and norm clipping are adopted, highlighting the need for
more advanced defenses.

SENSITIVITY, which measures fairness in machine learning models based on the
model's prediction sensitivity to perturbations in input features. The metric
attempts to quantify the extent to which a single prediction depends on a
protected attribute, where the protected attribute encodes the membership
status of an individual in a protected group. We show that the metric can be
theoretically linked with a specific notion of group fairness (statistical
parity) and individual fairness. It also correlates well with humans'
perception of fairness. We conduct experiments on two text classification
datasets : JIGSAW TOXICITY, and BIAS IN BIOS, and evaluate the correlations
between metrics and manual annotations on whether the model produced a fair
outcome. We observe that the proposed fairness metric based on prediction
sensitivity is statistically significantly more correlated with human
annotation than the existing counterfactual fairness metric.

Brownian particles that form a space-spanning network at low volume fractions.
The elastic properties of these systems result from the network microstructure,
which is very sensitive to shear history. Here, we take advantage of such
sensitivity to tune the viscoelastic properties of a colloidal gel made of
carbon black nanoparticles. Starting from a fluidized state under an applied
shear rate $\dot \gamma_0$, we use an abrupt flow cessation to trigger a
liquid-to-solid transition. We observe that the resulting gel is all the more
elastic when the shear rate $\dot \gamma_0$ is low and that the viscoelastic
spectra can be mapped on a master curve. Moreover, coupling rheometry to small
angle X-ray scattering allows us to show that the gel microstructure is
different from gels solely formed by thermal agitation where only two length
scales are observed: the dimension of the colloidal and the dimension the
fractal aggregates. Competition between shear and thermal energy leads to gels
with three characteristic length scales. Such gels structure in a percolated
network of fractal clusters that interpenetrate each other. Experiments on gels
prepared with various shear histories reveal that cluster interpenetration
increases with decreasing values of the shear rate $\dot \gamma_0$ applied
before flow cessation. These observations strongly suggest that cluster
interpenetration drives the gel elasticity, which we confirm using a structural
model. Our results, which are in stark contrast with previous literature, where
gel elasticity was either linked to cluster connectivity or to bending modes,
highlight a novel local parameter controlling the macroscopic viscoelastic
properties of colloidal gels.

and flexibly. Compared with complex feature-based methods, our DKD achieves
comparable or even better results and has better training efficiency on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MS-COCO datasets for image classification and object
detection tasks. This paper proves the great potential of logit distillation,

  Optimization Setting",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a Gray-Box Optimization (GBO) setting that allows for partial evaluations,
the fitness of an individual can be updated efficiently after a subset of its
variables has been modified. This enables more efficient evolutionary
optimization with the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA)
due to its key strength: Gene-pool Optimal Mixing (GOM). For each solution, GOM
performs variation for many (small) sets of variables. To improve efficiency
even further, parallel computing can be leveraged. For EAs, typically, this
comprises population-wise parallelization. However, unless population sizes are
large, this offers limited gains. For large GBO problems, parallelizing
GOM-based variation holds greater speed-up potential, regardless of population
size. However, this potential cannot be directly exploited because of
dependencies between variables. We show how graph coloring can be used to group
sets of variables that can undergo variation in parallel without violating
dependencies. We test the performance of a CUDA implementation of parallel GOM
on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for the Max-Cut problem, a well-known
problem for which the dependency structure can be controlled. We find that, for
sufficiently large graphs with limited connectivity, finding high-quality
solutions can be achieved up to 100 times faster, showcasing the great
potential of our approach.

candidate periodic outbursting young stellar objects (YSOs), based on the
unique morphology of the phase-folded light curves, proximity to Galactic HII
regions and mid-infrared colours. Five sources are spectroscopically confirmed
as accreting YSOs. Both fast-rise/slow-decay and slow-rise/fast-decay periodic
outbursts were found, but fast-rise/slow-decay outbursts predominate at the
highest amplitudes. The multi-wavelength colour variations are consistent with
a variable mass accretion process, as opposed to variable extinction. The
cycles are likely to be caused by dynamical perturbations from stellar or
planetary companions within the circumstellar disc. An additional search for
periodic variability amongst YSO candidates in published Spitzer-based
catalogues yielded a further 71 candidate periodic accretors, mostly with lower
amplitudes. These resemble cases of pulsed accretion but with unusually long
periods and greater regularity. The majority of other long-period variables are
pulsating dusty Miras with smooth and symmetric light curves. We find that some
Miras have redder $W3 - W4$ colours than previously thought, most likely due to
their surface chemical compositions.

evolution. Because numerical simulations and turbulent convection models
predict exponentially decreasing radial rms turbulent velocity, a popular
treatment of the overshoot mixing is to apply a diffusion process with
exponentially decreasing diffusion coefficient. It is important to investigate
the parameters of the diffusion coefficient because they determine the
efficiency of the mixing in the overshoot region. In this paper, we have
investigated the effects of the core overshoot mixing on the properties of the
core in solar models and have constrained the parameters of the overshoot model
by using helioseismic inferences and the observation of the solar 8B neutrino
flux. For solar-mass stars, the core overshoot mixing helps to prolong the
lifetime of the convective core developed at the ZAMS. If the strength of the
mixing is sufficiently high, the convective core in a solar model could survive
till the present solar age, leading to large deviations of the sound-speed and
density profiles comparing with the helioseismic inferences. The 8B neutrino
flux also favours a radiative solar core. Those provide a constraint on the
parameters of the exponential diffusion model of the convective overshoot
mixing. A limited asteroseismic investigation of 13 Kepler low-mass stars with
1.0 < M < 1.5 shows a mass-dependent range of the overshoot parameter. The
overshoot mixing processes for different elements are analyzed in detail. It is
found that the exponential diffusion overshoot model leads to different
effective overshoot mixing lengths for elements with different nuclear
equilibrium timescale.

accumulation ahead of the drying front, which are in tune with the most common
theories on the explosive spalling of concrete. Previous studies have shown
evidence of the existence of this phenomenon, however, they were biased by
artifacts and experimental limitations (such as the beam hardening effect and
changes in the microstructure of the material due to the presence of pressure
and temperature sensors). In the current work, rapid neutron tomography was
used to investigate the in-operando drying behavior of a high-alumina
refractory castable, proposing a novel experimental layout aimed at a truly
one-dimensional drying front. This setup provided more realistic boundary
conditions, such as the behavior of a larger wall heated from one of its sides,
while also preventing some nonphysical artifacts (notably beam hardening). By
eliminating these aspects, a direct proof that moisture accumulates ahead of

and other parameters (e.g., heating rates and properties of the sample related
to the moisture clog formation), as well as useful data for the validation and

maximized, whereas a lower similarity is enforced with all the other captions,

improves their selection while also increasing the similarity of other valid

the Pearson correlation coefficient between the oscillatory amplitude and
phase, and a trade-off relation between transport efficiency and phase
sensitivity can then be derived, which serves as a tighter form than the
estimator resulting from the conventional thermodynamic uncertainty relation

for the future of remote sensing and communication missions. However, they have
to meet strict synchronization requirements before their use is generalized.
When clock or local oscillator signals are generated locally at each of the
distributed nodes, achieving exact synchronization in absolute phase,
frequency, and time is a complex problem. In addition, satellite systems have
significant resource constraints, especially for small satellites, which are
envisioned to be part of the future CDSS. Thus, the development of precise,
robust, and resource-efficient synchronization techniques is essential for the
advancement of future CDSS. In this context, this survey aims to summarize and
categorize the most relevant results on synchronization techniques for DSS.
First, some important architecture and system concepts are defined. Then, the
synchronization methods reported in the literature are reviewed and
categorized. This article also provides an extensive list of applications and
examples of synchronization techniques for DSS in addition to the most
significant advances in other operations closely related to synchronization,
such as inter-satellite ranging and relative position. The survey also provides
a discussion on emerging data-driven synchronization techniques based on ML.
Finally, a compilation of current research activities and potential research
topics is proposed, identifying problems and open challenges that can be useful

problem. Using breast cancer detection as an example, we first identify a
mammogram-specific transformation paradigm and then systematically compare four
recent SSL methods representing a diversity of approaches. We develop a method
to convert a pretrained model from making predictions on uniformly tiled
patches to whole images, and an attention-based pooling method that improves
the classification performance. We found that the best SSL model substantially
outperformed the baseline supervised model. The best SSL model also improved
the data efficiency of sample labeling by nearly 4-fold and was highly
transferrable from one dataset to another. SSL represents a major breakthrough
in computer vision and may help the AI for medical imaging field to shift away
from supervised learning and dependency on scarce labels.

a paucity of events at low DM for all evolutionary models considered, resulting
in a sharp rise in the observed cumulative distribution function (CDF) in the

could be due to statistical fluctuations ($0.12 \le p \le 0.22$), a complicated

the dust charging and transportation mechanisms. The shared charge model could
not explain the observed velocity-diameter data. Both the isolated charge model

(particle-based) numerical model, based on the hybrid discrete element method
(DEM) and moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) mesh-free techniques, for
modeling the highly-dynamic ice-wave interactions. Both MPS and DEM belong to
mesh-free Lagrangian (particle) techniques. The model considers ice-wave
dynamics as a multiphase continuum-discrete system. While the MPS solves the
continuum equations of free-surface flow in a Lagrangian particle-based domain,
the DEM uses a multi-sphere Hertzian contact dynamic model to simulate the ice
floes motion and interaction. The hybrid model predicts the motion and
collision of ice floes as well as their interaction with water, boundaries, and
any obstacle in their way. Considering the mesh-free Lagrangian nature of both
DEM and MPS, the developed model has an inherent ability to predict the
free-drift (absence of internal stress) movements of the ice floes, e.g.,
sliding, rolling, colliding, and piling-up, in violent free-surface flow. A
small-scale and challenging experiment based on dam-break flow over dry and wet
beds with floating block floes, which mimics the characteristics of an
idealized jam release, has been conducted to provide useful and comprehensive
quality data for the validation of the proposed model, as well as other
numerical models. Experimental and numerical results of the free-surface
profile and the position of the blocks are compared. The results show the
ability of the model to numerically reproduce and predict the complex
three-dimensional dynamic behavior of wave-ice floes interaction. Overall, this
study is a first effort toward developing an ice-wave dynamics within a fully

understanding of the physics of the real-scale ice-wave or river ice dynamic
problems in the future.

transition matrices, is considered. Entropic quantities that describe the
randomness of the probability vectors, and also the randomness of the discrete
paths, are studied. Universal convex polytopes are introduced which contain all
future probability vectors, and which are based on the Birkhoff-von Neumann
expansion for doubly stochastic matrices. They are universal in the sense that
they depend only on the present probability vector, and are independent of the
doubly stochastic transition matrices that describe time evolution in the
future. It is shown that as the discrete time increases these convex polytopes
shrink, and the minimum entropy of the probability vectors in them increases.
These ideas are applied to a sequence of non-selective measurements (with
different projectors in each step) on a quantum system with $d$-dimensional
Hilbert space. The unitary time evolution in the intervals between the
measurements, is taken into account. The non-selective measurements destroy
stroboscopically the non-diagonal elements in the density matrix. This
`hermaphrodite' system is an interesting combination of a classical
probabilistic system (immediately after the measurements) and a quantum system
(in the intervals between the measurements). Various examples are discussed. In
the ergodic example, the system follows asymptotically all discrete paths with
the same probability. In the example of rapidly repeated non-selective
measurements, we get the well known quantum Zeno effect with `frozen discrete
paths' (presented here as a biproduct of our general methodology based on
Markov chains with doubly stochastic transition matrices).

observed images, CaRTS iteratively aligns tool models with image observations
by updating the initially incorrect robot kinematic parameters through forward
kinematics and differentiable rendering to optimize image feature similarity
end-to-end. We benchmark CaRTS with competing techniques on both synthetic as
well as real data from the dVRK, generated in precisely controlled scenarios to

achieves a Dice score of 93.4 that is preserved well (Dice score of 91.8) when

results. Similarly, we argue that the quantum density matrix can also enhance
the image feature information and the relationship between the features for the
classical image classification. Thus, we (i) combine density matrices and CNN
to design a new mechanism; (ii) apply the new mechanism to some representative
classical image classification tasks. A series of experiments show that the
application of quantum density matrix in image classification has the
generalization and high efficiency on different datasets. The application of
quantum density matrix both in classical question answering tasks and classical
image classification tasks show more effective performance.

analytical model of the physical parts of ultrastable laser is established, and
the first order resonance frequency is determined by FEA and well agrees with
the experimentally measured result. To verify the transport performance of the
portable ultrastable laser, it is tested for 100 km actual road transportation
and 60 min continuous vibration, corresponding to 1700 km road transportation.
The success of the test demonstrated that the portable ultrastable laser was
very robust. Meanwhile, the portable ultrastable lasers shows that the median
of the linewidth distribution is approximately 0.78 Hz, and the fractional
frequency instability is less than 3E-15 at 1 to 10 s averaging time. This
value approaches the total noise of 2.0E-15 including thermal noise and
residual amplitude modulation. The robust suggested that the portable
ultrastable laser might be a good candidate such as optical frequency transfer
and metrological systems.

from the beginning. The scientific basis of EEG-based emotion recognition in
the psychological and physiological levels is introduced. Further, we
categorize these reviewed works into different technical routes and illustrate

However, existing rumor detection (RD) models often assume the same training

(CPT-RD) framework, which avoids catastrophic forgetting (CF) of upstream tasks
during sequential task learning and enables bidirectional knowledge transfer
between domain tasks. Specifically, we propose the following strategies: (a)
Our design explicitly decouples shared and domain-specific knowledge, thus
reducing the interference among different domains during optimization; (b)
Several technologies aim to transfer knowledge of upstream tasks to deal with
emergencies; (c) A task-conditioned prompt-wise hypernetwork (TPHNet) is used
to consolidate past domains. In addition, CPT-RD avoids CF without the
necessity of a rehearsal buffer.

transfer mechanism and interfacial properties. This study uses molecular
dynamics simulations to investigate the impact of various electrostatic
interactions on the Kapitza resistance ($R_k$) on a hexagonal boron
nitride-water system. The Kapitza resistance at hexagonal boron nitride
nanotube (hBNNT)-water interface reduces with an increase in diameter of the
nanotube due to more aggregation of water molecules per unit surface area. An
increase in the partial charges on boron and nitride caused the reduction in
$R_k$. With the increase in partial charge, a better hydrogen bonding between
hBNNT and water was observed, whereas the structure and order of the water
molecules remain the same. Nevertheless, the addition of NaCl salt into water
does not have any influence on interfacial thermal transport. $R_k$ remains
unchanged with electrolyte concentration since the cumulative Coulombic
interaction between the ions, and the hBNNT is significantly less when compared
with water molecules. Furthermore, the effect of electric field strength on
interfacial heat transfer is also investigated by providing uniform positive
and negative surface charges on the outermost hBN layers. $R_k$ is nearly
independent of the practical range of applied electric fields and decreases
with an increasing electric field for extreme field strengths until the
electro-freezing phenomenon occurs. The ordering of water molecules towards the
charged surface leads to an increase in the layering effect, causing the
reduction in $R_k$ in the presence of an electric field.

years, and its potentials are now more apparent. However, transient data
generation and limited energy resources are the major bottlenecks of these
networks. Besides, minimum delay and other conventional quality of service
measurements are still valid requirements to meet. An efficient caching policy
can help meet the standard quality of service requirements while bypassing IoT
networks' specific limitations. Adopting deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithms enables us to develop an effective caching scheme without the need
for any prior knowledge or contextual information. In this work, we propose a
DRL-based caching scheme that improves the cache hit rate and reduces energy
consumption of the IoT networks, in the meanwhile, taking data freshness and
limited lifetime of IoT data into account. To better capture the
regional-different popularity distribution, we propose a hierarchical
architecture to deploy edge caching nodes in IoT networks. The results of
comprehensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms the
well-known conventional caching policies and an existing DRL-based solution in
terms of cache hit rate and energy consumption of the IoT networks by
considerable margins.

and out-of-distribution generalization. These benefits hold across a variety of
learning algorithms, experimental settings, and distribution shifts, and for
both simulated and real robot apparatuses. However, this is only the case when
hand-centric observability is sufficient; otherwise, including a third-person
perspective is necessary for learning, but also harms out-of-distribution
generalization. To mitigate this, we propose to regularize the third-person
information stream via a variational information bottleneck. On six
representative manipulation tasks with varying hand-centric observability
adapted from the Meta-World benchmark, this results in a state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning agent operating from both perspectives improving its

that the charge-discharge theory cannot explain the reversal of current when
water-metal interfaces switch from dynamic to static. All experiments can be
described after we distinguish a dynamic from a static interface and generalize
the photovoltaic-like effect to all dynamic junctions: excited electrons and
holes in a moving interface will be separated and swept under the built-in
electrical field, leading to a DC response. This generalized theory will lead
to an understanding and the design of efficient electricity generation based on
interfacial charge transfer.

boundaries. Recently, there has been interest in the effect of confinement by
complex three dimensional geometries, as might occur in structured environments
such as porous media, foams, gels, or biological tissues and ducts. The effects
of confinement for particles moving along boundaries has been extensively
studied, but in three dimensions active particles move not only parallel to
boundaries, but also towards or away from boundaries. The consequences of this
fore-aft clearance is less well understood. Swimmers that actively remodel
their environment create an ideal situation to study the effect of clearance,
since they maintain a steady clearance while translating. By numerically
studying the locomotion of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which de-gels
surrounding gastric mucus to make a co-moving pocket of fluid around itself, we
show that the effect of three-dimensional confinement is controlled by
clearance, rather than distance from a parallel boundary. Analytical
calculations show that the effect of clearance can be understood in terms of
flow structures, such as the generic pusher and puller flows of active
particles, indicating that our results should apply to a wide range of confined
active particles.
