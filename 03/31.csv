annihilating through velocity-independent processes. However, in the absence of
clear-cut observational evidence for the simplest candidates, the interest of
the community in more complex DM scenarios involving a velocity-dependent
cross-section has been growing steadily over the past few years. We present the
first systematic study of velocity-dependent DM annihilation (in particular
$p$-wave annihilation and Sommerfeld enhancement) in a variety of astrophysical
objects, not only including the well-studied Milky Way dwarf satellite
galaxies, but nearby dwarf irregular galaxies and local galaxy clusters as
well. Particular attention is given to the interplay between velocity
dependence and DM halo substructure. Uncertainties related to halo mass,
phase-space and substructure modelling are also discussed in this
velocity-dependent context. We show that, for $s$-wave annihilation, extremely
large subhalo boost factors are to be expected, up to $10^{11}$ in clusters and
up to $10^6-10^7$ in dwarf galaxies where subhalos are usually assumed not to
play an important role. Boost factors for $p$-wave annihilation are smaller but
can still reach $10^3$ in clusters. The angular extension of the DM signal is
also significantly impacted, with e.g. the cluster typical emission radius
increasing by a factor of order 10 in the $s$-wave case. We also compute the
signal contrast of the objects in our sample with respect to annihilation
happening in the Milky Way halo. Overall, we find that the hierarchy between
the brightest considered targets depends on the specific details of the assumed
particle-physics model.

nuclear norm minimization programs incorporating a $M_1 r$-dimensional subspace
of $n\times n$ matrices (where $M_1\geq 1$ conveys structural properties of the
subspace) allow accurate approximation of a rank $r$ matrix aligned with the
subspace from a near-optimal number of observed entries (within a logarithmic
factor of $M_1 r)$. The result is robust, where the error is proportional to
measurement noise, applies to full rank matrices, and reflects degraded output
when erroneous prior information is utilized. Numerical experiments are
presented that validate the theoretical behavior derived for several example
weighted programs.

a large Raman scattering cross-section, which is often inherent in new types of

Using the Fr\""ohlich Hamiltonian to describe the electron-phonon coupling in
such media, we analyze the operation of the system above the lasing threshold.
We show that below a critical value of the Fr\""ohlich constant, the laser can
only operate in the conventional regime: namely, there are coherent cavity
photons but no coherent phonons. Above the critical value, a new pump rate
threshold appears. Above this threshold, either joint self-oscillations of
coherent phonons in the gain medium and photons in a cavity or a chaotic regime
are established. We also find a range of the values of the Fr\""ohlich constant,
the pump rate, and the resonator eigenfrequency, in which more than one
dynamical regime of the system is stable. In this case the laser dynamics is
determined by the initial values of the resonator field, the active medium

oscillatory prevalence in a society of adaptive individuals. We also show that

We consider different evolution methods, mechanics formulations, fracture

The different model variants are implemented with common numerical methods
based on staggered solution of the phase-field and mechanics sub-problems via
FFT-based solvers. These methods mix standard approaches with novel elements,
such as the use of bound-constrained conjugate gradients for the phase field
sub-problem and a heuristic method for near-equilibrium evolution. We examine
differences in crack paths between model variants in simple model systems and
microstructures with randomly heterogeneous Young's modulus. Our results
indicate that near-equilibrium evolution methods are preferable for
quasi-static fracture of heterogeneous microstructures compared to minimization
and time-dependent methods. In examining mechanics formulations, we find
distinct effects of crack driving force and the model for contact implicit in
phase field fracture. Our results favor the use of a strain-spectral
decomposition for the crack driving force but not the contact model.
Irreversibility condition and fracture dissipation energy formulation were also
found to affect crack path selection, but systematic effects were difficult to
deduce due to the overall sensitivity of crack selection within the
heterogeneous microstructures. Our findings support the use of the AT1 model
over the AT2 model and irreversibility of the phase field within a crack set
rather than the entire domain. Sensitivity to these differences in formulation
was reduced but not eliminated by reducing the crack width parameter $\ell$
relative to the size scale of the random microstructures.

multiple energy states present in quantum dot materials and uses emission from
two discrete wavebands and two polarization states, so as to enhance
computational efficiency. The benchmark task used for this architecture, is the
equalization of a distorted 25Gbaud PAM-4 signal after 50Km of transmission at

propose a scenario to realize the Hopf term in lattice models. The central aim
is tuning the coupling between the spins and the Dirac fermions such that the
topological terms contributed by the two cones do not cancel each other. To
this end, we consider $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals for the Dirac fermions on the
honeycomb lattice such that there are totally four bands. By utilizing the
orbital degrees of freedom, a $\theta=2\pi$ Hopf term is successfully generated
for the spin system after integrating out the Dirac fermions. If the fermions
have a small gap $m_0$ or if the spin-orbit coupling is considered, then
$\theta$ is no longer quantized, but it may flow to multiple of $2\pi$ under
renormalization. The ground state and the physical response of a spin system

measurement noise. In Bayesian regression, we often use a Gaussian observation
model, where we control the level of aleatoric uncertainty with a noise
variance parameter. By contrast, for Bayesian classification we use a
categorical distribution with no mechanism to represent our beliefs about
aleatoric uncertainty. Our work shows that explicitly accounting for aleatoric
uncertainty significantly improves the performance of Bayesian neural networks.
We note that many standard benchmarks, such as CIFAR, have essentially no
aleatoric uncertainty. Moreover, we show data augmentation in approximate
inference has the effect of softening the likelihood, leading to
underconfidence and profoundly misrepresenting our honest beliefs about
aleatoric uncertainty. Accordingly, we find that a cold posterior, tempered by
a power greater than one, often more honestly reflects our beliefs about
aleatoric uncertainty than no tempering -- providing an explicit link between
data augmentation and cold posteriors. We show that we can match or exceed the
performance of posterior tempering by using a Dirichlet observation model,

At the same time, the great potential of deep learning to advance progress on

of the high bandwidth requirements of VR, there has also been significant
interest in the use of space-variant, foveated compression protocols. We have
integrated these techniques to create an end-to-end deep learning video
compression framework. A feature of our new compression model is that it
dispenses with the need for expensive search-based motion prediction
computations. This is accomplished by exploiting statistical regularities
inherent in video motion expressed by displaced frame differences. Foveation
protocols are desirable since only a small portion of a video viewed in VR may
be visible as a user gazes in any given direction. Moreover, even within a
current field of view (FOV), the resolution of retinal neurons rapidly
decreases with distance (eccentricity) from the projected point of gaze. In our
learning based approach, we implement foveation by introducing a Foveation
Generator Unit (FGU) that generates foveation masks which direct the allocation
of bits, significantly increasing compression efficiency while making it
possible to retain an impression of little to no additional visual loss given
an appropriate viewing geometry. Our experiment results reveal that our new

becomes crucial to include as many relevant physical processes and ingredients
as possible to refine signal predictions, in particular those which directly
relate to the intimate properties of DM. We investigate the combined impact of
DM subhalos and of the (velocity-dependent) Sommerfeld enhancement of the
annihilation cross section. Both features are expected to play an important
role in searches for thermal DM particle candidates with masses around or
beyond TeV, or in scenarios with a light dark sector. We provide a detailed
analytical description of the phenomena at play, and show how they scale with
the subhalo masses and the main Sommerfeld parameters. We derive approximate
analytical expressions that can be used to estimate the overall boost factors
resulting from these combined effects, from which the intricate phenomenology
can be better understood. DM subhalos lead to an increase of the Sommerfeld
effect by several orders of magnitude (for both $s$- and $p$-wave annihilation
processes), especially on resonances, which makes them critical to get sensible
gamma-ray signal predictions for typical targets of different masses (from
dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters).

locations and scales in an image. The recent query-based object detectors break
this convention by decoding image features with a set of learnable queries.
However, this paradigm still suffers from slow convergence, limited
performance, and design complexity of extra networks between backbone and
decoder. In this paper, we find that the key to these issues is the
adaptability of decoders for casting queries to varying objects. Accordingly,
we propose a fast-converging query-based detector, named AdaMixer, by improving
the adaptability of query-based decoding processes in two aspects. First, each
query adaptively samples features over space and scales based on estimated
offsets, which allows AdaMixer to efficiently attend to the coherent regions of
objects. Then, we dynamically decode these sampled features with an adaptive
MLP-Mixer under the guidance of each query. Thanks to these two critical
designs, AdaMixer enjoys architectural simplicity without requiring dense
attentional encoders or explicit pyramid networks. On the challenging MS COCO
benchmark, AdaMixer with ResNet-50 as the backbone, with 12 training epochs,
reaches up to 45.0 AP on the validation set along with 27.9 APs in detecting
small objects. With the longer training scheme, AdaMixer with ResNeXt-101-DCN
and Swin-S reaches 49.5 and 51.3 AP. Our work sheds light on a simple,
accurate, and fast converging architecture for query-based object detectors.

derive orthogonality relations between various beam types. Altogether, it
provides a comprehensive reference of all properties of Bessel beams that may

theorem. A super-exponential decrease for both types of error probabilities is
only possible in the trivial case when the two states are orthogonal, and hence
can be perfectly distinguished using only a single copy of the system.
  In this paper we show that a qualitatively different behaviour can occur when
there is correlation between the samples. Namely, we use gauge-invariant and
translation-invariant quasi-free states on the algebra of the canonical
anti-commutation relations to exhibit pairs of states on an infinite spin chain
with the properties that a) all finite-size restrictions of the states have
invertible density operators, and b) the type I and the type II error

synthesize images with smooth variations along semantically meaningful latent

GANs implicitly learn pixel-level correspondences across images, few studies
explored how to extract them explicitly. In this work, we introduce Coordinate
GAN (CoordGAN), a structure-texture disentangled GAN that learns a dense
correspondence map for each generated image. We represent the correspondence
maps of different images as warped coordinate frames transformed from a
canonical coordinate frame, i.e., the correspondence map, which describes the
structure (e.g., the shape of a face), is controlled via a transformation.
Hence, finding correspondences boils down to locating the same coordinate in
different correspondence maps. In CoordGAN, we sample a transformation to
represent the structure of a synthesized instance, while an independent texture
branch is responsible for rendering appearance details orthogonal to the
structure. Our approach can also extract dense correspondence maps for real
images by adding an encoder on top of the generator. We quantitatively
demonstrate the quality of the learned dense correspondences through
segmentation mask transfer on multiple datasets. We also show that the proposed
generator achieves better structure and texture disentanglement compared to

In this work, we derive these contributions, evolve the cosmological
perturbations until the end of the dark ages and show that they may have a
significant impact in the beginning of cosmic dawn. In particular, we find that

up to 1--2 orders of magnitude and that the matter power spectrum is further
suppressed with respect to $\Lambda$CDM by $5$-$10\%$ at $k\sim 200\, {\rm

based on machine learning lead to the conjecture that the family of quantum
triangle distributions of [arXiv:1905.04902] did not admit triangle-local
models in a larger range than the original proof. We prove part of this
conjecture in the affirmative. Our approach consists in reducing the family of
original, four-outcome distributions to families of binary-outcome ones, and
then using the inflation technique to prove that these families of
binary-outcome distributions do not admit triangle-local models. This
constitutes the first successful use of inflation in a proof of quantum
nonlocality in networks whose nonlocality could not be proved with alternative
methods. Moreover, we provide a method to extend proofs of network nonlocality
in concrete distributions of a parametrized family to continuous ranges of the
parameter. In the process, we produce a large collection of network Bell
inequalities for the triangle scenario with binary outcomes, which are of
independent interest.

Merging binary black holes that form from stellar post-merger binaries have
exceptionally low mass ratios. We identify a critical mass ratio $q\simeq0.5$

show that after including their additional contribution, the mass ratio

the optical brightness variations that are correlated with the submm emission

critical issue is determining what fraction of the cross-power spectrum might
be caused by emission from Galactic cirrus. For one of the fields, the Galactic
contamination is approximately a factor of 10 higher than the extragalactic
signal, with the contamination being estimated using a linear regression from
several external survey maps; however, for the other fields, the contamination
is typically around 20 per cent. An additional discriminant is that the
cross-power spectrum is of the approximate form $P(k)\propto 1/k$, much
shallower than that of Galactic cirrus. We interpret the results in a
halo-model framework, which shows good agreement with independent measurements
for the scalings of star-formation rates in galaxies. The approach presented in

molecular clouds, the progenitors of dense star clusters. But the evolutionary
fate of these young massive clusters, and whether they can become the old

interplay of internal dynamical processes and external galactic effects. We
present the first star-by-star $N$-body models of massive ($N\sim10^5-10^7$)
star clusters formed in a FIRE-2 MHD simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy,
with the relevant initial conditions and tidal forces extracted from the

6\times10^4M_{\odot}$ from Grudi\'c et al.~2022 and integrate them to $z=0$

MW-like system with 148 GCs, predominantly formed during the early, bursty mode
of star formation. Our GCs are younger, less massive, and more core-collapsed
than clusters in the Milky Way or M31. This results from the assembly history
and age-metallicity relationship of the host galaxy: younger clusters are
preferentially born in stronger tidal fields and initially retain fewer
stellar-mass black holes, causing them to lose mass faster and reach core
collapse sooner than older GCs. Our results suggest that the masses and
core/half-light radii of GCs are shaped not only by internal dynamical
processes, but also by the specific evolutionary history of their host
galaxies. These results emphasize that $N$-body studies with realistic stellar
physics are crucial to understanding the evolution and present-day properties
of GC systems.

which is relevant to Seebeck coefficient measurements. We show that the

Si-based quantum computation. Among them, $2P:1P$ qubits have a built-in dipole
moment, enabling all-electrical spin operation via hyperfine mediated electron
dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The development of all-electrical multi-donor dot
qubits requires a full understanding of their EDSR and coherence properties,
incorporating multi-valley nature of their ground state. Here, by introducing a
variational effective mass wave-function, we examine the impact of qubit
geometry and nearby charge defects on the electrical operation and coherence of
$2P:1P$ qubits. We report four outcomes: (i) The difference in the hyperfine
interaction between the $2P$ and $1P$ sites enables fast EDSR, with $T_\pi \sim
10-50$ ns and a Rabi ratio $ (T_1/T_\pi) \sim 10^6$. We analyse qubits with the
$2P:1P$ axis aligned along the [100], [110] and [111] crystal axes, finding
that the fastest EDSR time $T_\pi$ occurs when the $2P:1P$ axis is
$\parallel$[111], while the best Rabi ratio occurs when it is $\parallel$
[100]. This difference is attributed to the difference in the wave function
overlap between $2P$ and $1P$ for different geometries. In contrast, the choice
of $2P$ axis has no visible impact on qubit operation. (ii) Sensitivity to
random telegraph noise due to nearby charge defects depends strongly on the
location of the nearby defects with respect to the qubit. For certain
orientations of defects random telegraph noise has an appreciable effect both
on detuning and $2P-1P$ tunneling, with the latter inducing gate errors. (iii)
The qubit is robust against $1/f$ noise provided it is operated away from the
charge anticrossing. (iv) Entanglement via exchange is several orders of
magnitude faster than dipole-dipole coupling. These findings pave the way
towards fast, low-power, coherent and scalable donor dot-based quantum
computing.

complex organics. This can be interpreted as a low abundance of these
molecules, alternatively they could be present in the system but are not seen
in the gas. The goal is to investigate the latter hypothesis for methanol. We
will attempt to answer the question: Does the presence of a disk and optically
thick dust reduce methanol emission even if methanol is abundant in the ices
and gas? Using the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, methanol emission lines
from an envelope-only model and an envelope-plus-disk model are calculated and
compared with each other and the observations. Methanol emission from the
envelope-only model is always stronger than from the envelope-plus-disk model
by at least a factor 2 as long as the disk radius is larger than 30 au (for L=8
L$_{\odot}$). In most cases, this is due to lower temperatures and, hence, the
smaller amount of warm methanol inside the snow surface of the
envelope-plus-disk model. The intensities drop by more than an order of
magnitude for models including high mm opacity dust grains and disk radii of at
least 50 au (for L=8 L$_{\odot}$) due to continuum over-subtraction. The line
intensities from the envelope-only models overproduce the observations of
protostars with lower methanol emission even with large dust optical depth
effects. The envelope-plus-disk models can explain the bulk of the
observations. However, they can only reproduce the observations of sources with
high luminosities and low methanol emission when dust optical depth effects
especially continuum over-subtraction in the disk becomes effective. Therefore,
both the effects of disk and dust optical depth should be considered to explain
the observations. In conclusion: Absence of methanol emission does not imply
absence of methanol molecules in either gas or ice.

of telescopes at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station measuring degree-scale
$B$-mode polarization imprinted in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by
primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). These telescopes are compact refracting
polarimeters mapping about 2% of the sky, observing at a broad range of
frequencies to account for the polarized foreground from Galactic synchrotron
and thermal dust emission. Our latest publication ""BK18"" utilizes the data
collected up to the 2018 observing season, in conjunction with the publicly
available WMAP and Planck data, to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. It
particularly includes (1) the 3-year BICEP3 data which is the current deepest
CMB polarization map at the foreground-minimum 95 GHz; and (2) the Keck 220 GHz
map with a higher signal-to-noise ratio on the dust foreground than the Planck
353 GHz map. We fit the auto- and cross-spectra of these maps to a
multicomponent likelihood model ($\Lambda$CDM+dust+synchrotron+noise+$r$) and
find it to be an adequate description of the data at the current noise level.
The likelihood analysis yields $\sigma(r)=0.009$. The inference of $r$ from our
baseline model is tightened to $r_{0.05}=0.014^{+0.010}_{-0.011}$ and
$r_{0.05}<0.036$ at 95% confidence, meaning that the BICEP/Keck $B$-mode data
is the most powerful existing dataset for the constraint of PGWs. The up-coming
BICEP Array telescope is projected to reach $\sigma(r) \lesssim 0.003$ using
data up to 2027.

on target imaging modality with no labels. In this work, we propose a
self-training based unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 3D medical

Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea on high-resolution T2 Magnetic Resonance
Images (MRI). Our target-aware contrast conversion network translates source
domain annotated T1 MRI to pseudo T2 MRI to enable segmentation training on
target domain, while preserving important anatomical features of interest in
the converted images. Iterative self-training is followed to incorporate
unlabeled data to training and incrementally improve the quality of
pseudo-labels, thereby leading to improved performance of segmentation. COSMOS

conversion, motivated by the findings of our post-processing analysis that
shows evidence of electron-neutrino lepton-number (ELN) crossings deep inside
the disk, hence suggesting possibly non-trivial effects due to neutrino flavor
mixing. We implement a parametric, dynamically self-consistent treatment of
fast conversion in time-dependent simulations and examine the impact on the
disk and its outflows. By activating the, otherwise inefficient, emission of
heavy-lepton neutrinos, fast conversions enhance the disk cooling rates and
reduce the absorption rates of electron-type neutrinos, causing a reduction of
the electron fraction in the disk by 0.03-0.06 and in the ejected material by
0.01-0.03. The r-process yields are enhanced by typically no more than a factor
of two, rendering the overall impact of fast conversions modest. The kilonova
is prolonged as a net result of increased lanthanide opacities and enhanced
radioactive heating rates. We observe only mild sensitivity to the disk mass,
the condition for the onset of flavor conversion, and to the considered cases
of flavor mixing. Remarkably, parametric models of flavor mixing that conserve
the lepton numbers per family result in an overall smaller impact than models
invoking three-flavor equipartition, often assumed in previous works.

After an initial transient phase, all of our models reach approximately
steady-state outflow solutions with positive energies and sonic surfaces
captured on the computational grid. Our non-rotating and slower-rotating models
(angular velocity relative to Keplerian $\Omega/\Omega_{\rm K} \lesssim 0.4$;
spin period $P \gtrsim 2$ ms) generate approximately spherically symmetric
outflows with properties in good agreement with previous PNS wind studies. By
contrast, our most rapidly spinning PNS solutions ($\Omega/\Omega_{\rm K}
\gtrsim 0.75$; $P \approx 1$ ms) generate outflows focused in the rotational
equatorial plane with much higher mass-loss rates (by over an order of
magnitude), lower velocities, lower entropy, and lower asymptotic electron
fractions, than otherwise similar non-rotating wind solutions. Although such
rapidly spinning PNS are likely rare in nature, their atypical nucleosynthetic
composition and outsized mass yields could render them important contributors
of light neutron-rich nuclei compared to more common slowly rotating PNS birth.
Our calculations pave the way to including the combined effects of rotation and
a dynamically-important large-scale magnetic field on the wind properties

Fe-group nuclei. However, theoretical models for many scenarios predict that
non-thermal ionisation leads to multiply-ionised species whose recombination
photons ionise and deplete Fe$^{+}$ , resulting in negligible [Fe II] emission.
We investigate a method to determine the collisional excitation conditions from
[Fe II] line ratios independently from the ionisation state and find that it
cannot be applied to highly-ionised models due to the influence of
recombination cascades on Fe$^{+}$ level populations. When the ionisation state
is artificially lowered, the line ratios (and excitation conditions) are too
similar to distinguish between explosion scenarios. We investigate changes to
the treatment of non-thermal energy deposition as a way to reconcile
over-ionised theoretical models with observations and find that a simple work
function approximation provides closer agreement with the data for sub-Mch
models than a detailed Spencer-Fano treatment with widely-used cross section
data. To quantify the magnitude of additional heating processes that would be
required to sufficiently reduce ionisation from fast leptons, we artificially
boost the rate of energy loss to free electrons. We find that the equivalent of
as much as an eight times increase to the plasma loss rate would be needed to
reconcile the sub-Mch model with observed spectra. Future studies could
distinguish between reductions in the non-thermal ionisation rates and
increased recombination rates, such as by clumping.

radially outward, in order to re-axisymmetrize the vortex, but cease to travel
at a critical distance, known as the stagnation radius. We utilize direct
numerical simulations (DNS) and an inviscid model developed by linearizing the
momentum and vorticity transport equations around the base (unperturbed) flow
in helical coordinates to demonstrate that, in contrast with 2D cases, 3D
vortices enable the unbounded radial propagation of asymmetries. We further
apply the Wenzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) analysis to the linear model, treating
perturbations as compact wavepackets, to transform the PDEs of the linear model
to a few ODEs. However it has been shown in the climate science community that
the WKB approach ubiquitously predicts stagnation radii and heights for
disturbances introduced to 3D cyclone-like vortices, here, we identify a narrow
range of parameters, for which the WKB analysis also supports an unrestrained
propagation for disturbances. Finally, the mechanisms governing the momentum
transport at different stages and locations, thereby promoting the outward
advection of perturbations, are elucidated using the the linear rapid
distortion theory and numerical simulations. Since the DNS of the full
Navier-Stokes equations rapidly stabilizes to a laminar configuration, the DNS
of the linearized transport equations and the nonlinear governing equations
without base-flow interactions are also conducted, in order to uncover the
primary mechanisms for the growth and radial propagation of perturbations as

significant source of interstellar medium (ISM) ionization in low-metallicity

observations of a sample of 30 galaxies at $D \approx$~200--450 Mpc that have
high specific star-formation rates of 3--9 Gyr$^{-1}$ and metallicities near $Z
\approx 0.3 Z_\odot$, we provide new measurements of the average 0.5--8 keV
spectral shape and normalization per unit star-formation rate (SFR). We model
the sample-combined X-ray spectrum as a combination of hot gas and high-mass
X-ray binary (HMXB) populations and constrain their relative contributions. We
derive scaling relations of $\log L_{\rm 0.5-8 keV}^{\rm HMXB}$/SFR $= 40.19
\pm 0.06$ and $\log L_{\rm 0.5-2 keV}^{\rm gas}$/SFR $= 39.58^{+0.17}_{-0.28}$;
significantly elevated compared to local relations. The HMXB scaling is also
somewhat higher than $L_{\rm 0.5-8 keV}^{\rm HMXB}$-SFR-$Z$ relations presented
in the literature, potentially due to our galaxies having relatively low HMXB
obscuration and young and X-ray luminous stellar populations. The elevation of
the hot gas scaling relation is at the level expected for diminished
attenuation due to a reduction of metals; however, we cannot conclude that an
$L_{\rm 0.5-2 keV}^{\rm gas}$-SFR-$Z$ relation is driven solely by changes in
ISM metal content. Finally, we present SFR-scaled spectral models (both
emergent and intrinsic) that span the X-ray--to--IR band, providing new

distant static polarized sources will appear to oscillate with a frequency
proportional to the ALP mass. We use observations of the cosmic microwave

quantum many-body systems to the physics of black holes. Many of these
applications are related to the generation of quantum pseudorandomness: Random
quantum circuits are known to approximate unitary $t$-designs. Unitary
$t$-designs are probability distributions that mimic Haar randomness up to
$t$th moments. In a seminal paper, Brand\~{a}o, Harrow and Horodecki prove that
random quantum circuits on qubits in a brickwork architecture of depth $O(n
t^{10.5})$ are approximate unitary $t$-designs. In this work, we revisit this
argument, which lower bounds the spectral gap of moment operators for local
random quantum circuits by $\Omega(n^{-1}t^{-9.5})$. We improve this lower
bound to $\Omega(n^{-1}t^{-4-o(1)})$, where the $o(1)$ term goes to $0$ as
$t\to\infty$. A direct consequence of this scaling is that random quantum
circuits generate approximate unitary $t$-designs in depth $O(nt^{5+o(1)})$.
Our techniques involve Gao's quantum union bound and the unreasonable
effectiveness of the Clifford group. As an auxiliary result, we prove fast
convergence to the Haar measure for random Clifford unitaries interleaved with

higher densities for quarks in the MIT bag model. Also, the anisotropic speed
of sound in the presence of a magnetic field is derived from first principles.

the breaking of the rotational symmetry in the presence of a magnetic field.

a rigid outer wall. Finally, we connect these results to the curved shapes that
these cyanobacteria naturally take while gliding, and quantify the forces
generated internally to maintain this shape. The measurements can be used to
model interactions between filamentous cyanobacteria, or with their

factored representation of the individual time-varying change factors. We prove
that under standard assumptions, we can completely recover the causal graph

Through our general framework, we can consider general non-stationary scenarios

outperforms existing approaches in terms of return, compactness of the latent

contain at least one heavy quark Q=c or b, the majority including two heavy

(a) how are quarks organized inside these multiquark states -- as compact
objects with all quarks within one confinement volume, interacting via color
forces, perhaps with an important role played by diquarks, or as deuteron-like
hadronic molecules, bound by light-meson exchange? (b) what other multiquark
states should we expect? The two questions are tightly intertwined. Each of the
interpretations provides a natural explanation of parts of the data, but
neither explains all of the data. It is quite possible that both kinds of

made in instruction following -- building a follower to navigate environments
under the guidance of instructions. However, far less attention has been paid
to the inverse task: instruction generation -- learning a speaker~to generate
grounded descriptions for navigation routes. Existing VLN methods train a
speaker independently and often treat it as a data augmentation tool to
strengthen the follower while ignoring rich cross-task relations. Here we
describe an approach that learns the two tasks simultaneously and exploits
their intrinsic correlations to boost the training of each: the follower judges
whether the speaker-created instruction explains the original navigation route
correctly, and vice versa. Without the need of aligned instruction-path pairs,
such cycle-consistent learning scheme is complementary to task-specific
training targets defined on labeled data, and can also be applied over
unlabeled paths (sampled without paired instructions). Another agent,
called~creator is added to generate counterfactual environments. It greatly
changes current scenes yet leaves novel items -- which are vital for the
execution of original instructions -- unchanged. Thus more informative training
scenes are synthesized and the three agents compose a powerful VLN learning
system. Extensive experiments on a standard benchmark show that our approach

knowledge of old classes is a very challenging research problem. Moreover, it
is imperative that such learning must respect certain memory and computational
constraints such as (i) training samples are limited to only a few per class,
(ii) the computational cost of learning a novel class remains constant, and
(iii) the memory footprint of the model grows at most linearly with the number
of classes observed. To meet the above constraints, we propose C-FSCIL, which
is architecturally composed of a frozen meta-learned feature extractor, a
trainable fixed-size fully connected layer, and a rewritable dynamically
growing memory that stores as many vectors as the number of encountered
classes. C-FSCIL provides three update modes that offer a trade-off between
accuracy and compute-memory cost of learning novel classes. C-FSCIL exploits
hyperdimensional embedding that allows to continually express many more classes
than the fixed dimensions in the vector space, with minimal interference. The
quality of class vector representations is further improved by aligning them
quasi-orthogonally to each other by means of novel loss functions. Experiments
on the CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Omniglot datasets show that C-FSCIL
outperforms the baselines with remarkable accuracy and compression. It also
scales up to the largest problem size ever tried in this few-shot setting by
learning 423 novel classes on top of 1200 base classes with less than 1.6%
accuracy drop. Our code is available at

The spectra of perturbations around the CM monopole do not contain negative

stable, but all monopoles with $|n|\geq 2$ are unstable with respect to
perturbations with angular momentum $j=|n|/2-1$. The Abelian $|n|=2$ monopole
is unstable only within the $j=0$ sector whereas the CM monopole also has
$|n|=2$ and belongs to the same sector, hence it may be viewed as a stable

stable remnants exist also for monopoles with $|n|>2$, hence the CM monopole
may be just the first member of a sequence of non-Abelian monopoles with higher

of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from the raw digitized signal in the
signal processing chain of a typical radio astronomy experiment. The main
advantage of our method is that it does not require a training set. Instead,
our method relies on the fact that the true signal of interest coming from
astronomical sources is thermal and therefore described as a Gaussian random
process, which cannot be compressed. We employ a variational encoder/decoder
network to find the compressible information in the datastream that can explain
the most variance with the fewest degrees of freedom. We demonstrate it on a
set of toy problems and stored ringbuffers from the Baryon Mapping eXperiment
(BMX) prototype. We find that the RFI subtraction is effective at cleaning
simulated timestreams: while we find that the power spectra of the RFI-cleaned
timestreams output by the NN suffer from extra signal consistent with additive
noise, we find that it is generally around percent level across the band and
sub 10 percent in contaminated spectral channels even when RFI power is an
order of magnitude larger than the signal. We discuss advantages and
limitations of this method and possible implementation in the front-end of
future radio experiments.

lattice thermal conductivity than stable Si$-$I from 300 to 500~K, attributed
from the stronger phonon scattering in three$-$phonon scattering processes of

along $x$ axis due to the small effective masses of electron along this

Owing to the lower lattice thermal conductivity and optimistic electrical

performance under scenes with many occlusions and large motion if not using
temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel Reference Search (RS)
module to provide a more reliable association based on the deformable

object among frames. RS takes previous detected results as references to
aggregate the corresponding features from the combined features of the adjacent
frames and makes a one-to-one track state prediction for each reference in
parallel. Therefore, RS can attain a reliable association coping with
unexpected motions by leveraging visual temporal features while maintaining the
strong detection performance by decoupling from the detector. Our RS module can
also be compatible with the structure of the other tracking by detection
frameworks. Furthermore, we propose a joint training strategy and an effective

non-stationary sequences obtained by considering whether the trend functions
are identical or not. We show that a sequence of suitably normalised $k$th
order statistics converges in distribution to a limiting random variable which
can be a negative log transformed Erlang distributed random variable, a Normal
random variable or a mixture of them, according to three conditions deduced
through the model parameters. Remarkably, this phenomenon resembles that for

existing approaches follow the contrastive learning pipeline to construct
positive and negative pairs by sampling different clips. However, this

global temporal structures. The major reason is that the positive pairs, i.e.,
different clips sampled from the same video, have limited temporal receptive
field, and usually share similar background but differ in motions. To address
these problems, we propose a framework to jointly utilize local clips and
global videos to learn from detailed region-level correspondence as well as
general long-term temporal relations. Based on a set of controllable
augmentations, we achieve accurate appearance and motion pattern alignment
through soft spatio-temporal region contrast. Our formulation is able to avoid
the low-level redundancy shortcut by mutual information minimization to improve
the generalization. We also introduce local-global temporal order dependency to
further bridge the gap between clip-level and video-level representations for
robust temporal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
is superior on three video benchmarks in action recognition and video
retrieval, capturing more accurate temporal dynamics.

types of devices, each for a different task: mobile sensors for navigation and
molecule releasing (for communication), fusion centers (FC)s for sampling,
amplifying and forwarding the signal, and a gateway for making decision or
exchanging the information with an external device. The sensors move randomly
in the environment to reach the abnormality. We consider both collaborative and
non-collaborative sensors that simultaneously release their molecules to the
FCs when the number of activated sensors or the moving time reach a certain
threshold, respectively. The FCs amplify the received signal and forward it to
the gateway for decision making using either an ideal or a noisy communication
channel. A practical application of the proposed model is drug delivery in a
tissue of human body, in order to guide the nanomachine bound drug to the exact
location. The decision rules and probabilities of error are obtained for two

systems with switched unknown parameters to estimate the states and parameters
simultaneously. The main challenge lies in how to eliminate the disturbance
effect of zero-input responses caused by the switching on the parameter
estimation. These responses depend on the unknown states at switching instants
(SASI) and constitute an additive disturbance to the parameter estimation,
which obstructs parameter convergence to zero. Our solution is to treat the
zero-input responses as excitations instead of disturbances. This is realized
by first augmenting the system parameter with the SASI and then developing an
estimator for the augmented parameter using the \textit{dynamic regression
extension and mixing} (DREM) technique. Thanks to its property of element-wise
parameter adaptation, the system parameter estimation is decoupled from the
SASI. As a result, the estimation errors of system states and parameters
converge to zero asymptotically. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed
adaptive observer is guaranteed in the presence of disturbances and noise. A
numerical example validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

kinematics of gaseous discs in late-type dwarf galaxies. We create
high-resolution 21-cm 'observations' of simulated dwarfs produced in two
variations of the EAGLE galaxy formation model: one where supernova-driven gas
flows redistribute dark matter and form constant-density central 'cores', and
another where the central 'cusps' survive intact. We 'observe' each galaxy
along multiple sight lines and derive a rotation curve for each observation
using a conventional tilted-ring approach to model the gas kinematics. We find
that the modelling process introduces systematic discrepancies between the
recovered rotation curve and the actual circular velocity curve driven
primarily by (i) non-circular gas orbits within the discs; (ii) the finite
thickness of gaseous discs, which leads to overlap of different radii in
projection; and (iii) departures from dynamical equilibrium. Dwarfs with dark
matter cusps often appear to have a core, whilst the inverse error is less
common. These effects naturally reproduce an observed trend which other models
struggle to explain: late-type dwarfs with more steeply-rising rotation curves
appear to be dark matter-dominated in the inner regions, whereas the opposite
seems to hold in galaxies with core-like rotation curves. We conclude that if
similar effects affect the rotation curves of observed dwarfs, a late-type
dwarf population in which all galaxies have sizeable dark matter cores is most
likely incompatible with current measurements.

temperatures towards warmer (or colder) spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
between low and high redshift. These conclusions are driven by both theoretical
models and empirical measurement. Such claims sometimes contradict one another
and are prone to biases in samples or SED fitting techniques. What has made
direct comparisons difficult is that there is no uniform approach to fitting
galaxies' infrared/millimeter SEDs. Here we aim to standardize the measurement
of galaxies' dust temperatures with a python-based SED fitting procedure,
MCIRSED. We draw on reference datasets observed by IRAS, Herschel, and Scuba-2
to test for redshift evolution out to $z\sim2$. We anchor our work to the
L$_{IR}$-$\lambda_{peak}$ plane, where there is an empirically observed
anti-correlation between IR luminosity and rest-frame peak wavelength (an
observational proxy for luminosity-weighted dust temperature) such that
$\lambda_{peak}=\lambda_{t}({L_{IR}}/{L_{t}})^{\eta}$ where
$\eta=-0.09\pm0.01$, L$_{t}=10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, and $\lambda_{t}=92\pm2\mu$m.
We find no evidence for redshift evolution of galaxies' temperatures, or
$\lambda_{peak}$, at fixed L$_{IR}$ from $0<z<2$ with >99.99% confidence. Our
finding does not preclude evolution in dust temperatures at fixed stellar mass,
which is expected from a non-evolving L$_{IR}$-$\lambda_{peak}$ relation and a
strongly evolving SFR-M$_\star$ relation. The breadth of dust temperatures at a
given L$_{IR}$ is likely driven by variation in galaxies' dust geometries and
sizes and does not evolve. Testing for L$_{IR}$-$\lambda_{peak}$ evolution
toward higher redshift ($z\sim5-6$) requires better sampling of galaxies' dust
SEDs near their peaks (observed $\sim$200-600$\mu$m) with $<$1 mJy sensitivity.
This poses a significant challenge to current instrumentation.

model and study the role social identity -- a person's sense of belonging to a
group -- plays in human information consumption. A hallmark of Social Identity
Theory (SIT) is the notion of 'status', i.e., an individual's desire to enhance
their and their 'in-group's' utility relative to that of an 'out-group'. In the
context of belief formation, this comes off as a desire to believe positive
news about the in-group and negative news about the out-group, which has been
empirically shown to support belief in misinformation and false news.
  We model this phenomenon as a Stackelberg game being played over an
information channel between a news-source (sender) and news-consumer
(receiver), with the receiver incorporating the 'status' associated with social
identity in their utility, in addition to accuracy. We characterize the
strategy that must be employed by the sender to ensure that its message is
trusted by receivers of all identities while maximizing their overall quality
of information. We show that, as a rule, this optimal quality of information at
equilibrium decreases when a receiver's sense of identity increases. We further
demonstrate how extensions of our model can be used to quantitatively estimate
the level of importance given to identity in a population.

people access, and their impact on our society is being analyzed from different
perspectives, such as users' discrimination. A notable example is represented
by reputation-based ranking systems, a class of systems that rely on users'
reputation to generate a non-personalized item-ranking, proved to be biased
against certain demographic classes. To safeguard that a given sensitive user's
attribute does not systematically affect the reputation of that user, prior
work has operationalized a reputation independence constraint on this class of
systems. In this paper, we uncover that guaranteeing reputation independence
for a single sensitive attribute is not enough. When mitigating biases based on
one sensitive attribute (e.g., gender), the final ranking might still be biased
against certain demographic groups formed based on another attribute (e.g.,
age). Hence, we propose a novel approach to introduce reputation independence
for multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously. We then analyze the extent to
which our approach impacts on discrimination and other important properties of
the ranking system, such as its quality and robustness against attacks.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our approach leads to less
biased rankings with respect to multiple users' sensitive attributes, without
affecting the system's quality and robustness.

propagate through the nuclear medium, interacting with it via several

low-energy charged particles, referred to as grey tracks. We use the
theoretical components of the BeAGLE event generator to interpret grey track
signatures of parton transport and hadron formation by comparing its
predictions to E665 data. We extend the base version of BeAGLE by adding four
different options for describing parton energy loss. The E665 data we used
consists of multiplicity ratios for fixed-target scattering of 490 GeV muons on
Xe normalized to deuterium as a function of the number of grey tracks. We
compare multiplicity ratios for E665 grey tracks to the predictions of BeAGLE,
varying the options and parameters to determine which physics phenomena can be
identified by these data. We find that grey tracks are unaffected by
modifications of the forward production. Thus their production must be
dominated by interactions with hadrons in the backward region. This offers the
advantage that selecting certain particles in the forward region is unlikely to
bias a centrality selection. We see a strong correlation between the number of
grey tracks and the in-medium path length. Our energy loss model does not
reproduce the suppression observed in the projectile region. We see an
underprediction of the proton production rate in backward kinematics,
suggesting that a stronger source of interaction with the nuclear medium is
needed for accurate modeling. These results lay an important foundation for
future spectator tagging studies at both Jefferson Lab and at the Electron-Ion

across two different domains such as visible and thermal. Large domain
discrepancy makes HFR a difficult problem. Recent methods attempting to fill
the gap via synthesis have achieved promising results, but their performance is
still limited by the scarcity of paired training data. In practice, large-scale
heterogeneous face data are often inaccessible due to the high cost of
acquisition and annotation process as well as privacy regulations. In this
paper, we propose a new face hallucination paradigm for HFR, which not only
enables data-efficient synthesis but also allows to scale up model training
without breaking any privacy policy. Unlike existing methods that learn face
synthesis entirely from scratch, our approach is particularly designed to take
advantage of rich and diverse facial priors from visible domain for more
faithful hallucination. On the other hand, large-scale training is enabled by
introducing a new federated learning scheme to allow institution-wise
collaborations while avoiding explicit data sharing. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the advantages of our approach in tackling HFR under current data
limitations. In a unified framework, our method yields the state-of-the-art
hallucination results on multiple HFR datasets.

rely on measuring the velocity widths of broad optical-UV emission lines (e.g.,
H$\beta$ and Mg II $\lambda2800$). However, such lines tend to be weak or
inaccessible in the most distant quasars, leading to increasing uncertainty in
L/L_Edd estimates at $z > 6$. Utilizing a carefully selected sample of 53
radio-quiet quasars that have H$\beta$ and C IV $\lambda1549$ spectroscopy as
well as {\sl Chandra} coverage, we searched for a robust accretion-rate
indicator for quasars, particularly at the highest-accessible redshifts ($z
\sim 6-7$). Our analysis explored relationships between the H$\beta$-based
L/L_Edd, the equivalent width (EW) of C IV, and the optical-to-X-ray spectral
slope (a_ox). Our results show that EW(C IV) is the strongest indicator of the
H$\beta$-based L/L_Edd parameter, consistent with previous studies, although
significant scatter persists particularly for sources with weak C IV lines. We
do not find evidence for the a_ox parameter improving this relation, and we do
not find a significant correlation between a_ox and H$\beta$-based L/L_Edd.
This absence of an improved relationship may reveal a limitation in our sample.
X-ray observations of additional luminous sources, found at $z \gtrsim 1$, may
allow us to mitigate the biases inherent in our archival sample and test
whether X-ray data could improve L/L_Edd estimates. Furthermore, deeper X-ray
observations of our sources may provide accurate measurements of the hard-X-ray
power-law photon index ($\Gamma$), which is considered an unbiased L/L_Edd
indicator. Correlations between EW(C IV) and a_ox with $\Gamma$-based L/L_Edd
may yield a more robust prediction of a quasar normalized accretion rate.

remains to be known about their formation. Class I methanol masers may be
unique tracers of an early stage of high mass star formation, and a better
understanding of such masers will allow them to be used as more effective
probes of the high mass star forming process. We present an investigation of
the long-term variability of Class I methanol masers at 44 GHz toward the high
mass star forming region DR21(OH). We compare observations taken in 2017 to
2012 and also to 2001 data from the literature. A total of 57 maser spots were
found in the 2017 data, with center velocities ranging between -8.65 km/s to
+2.56 km/s. The masers are arranged in a western and an eastern lobe with two
arcs in each lobe that look like bowshocks, consistent with previous
observations. The general trend is an increase in intensity from 2001 to 2012,
and a decrease from 2012 to 2017. Variability appears to be more prevalent in
the inner arc of the western lobe than in the outer arc. We speculate that this
may be a consequence of episodic accretion, in which a later accretion event
has resulted in ejection of material whose shock reached the inner arc at some
point in time after 2001. We conclude that class I methanol masers are variable
on long timescales (of the order of 5-10 years).

Hankel nuclear norm regularization. Hankel regularization encourages the
low-rankness of the Hankel matrix, which maps to the low-orderness of the
system. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization and
carefully contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimator. Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response
and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an
input excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the
system using optimal number of observations in the true system order and
achieve strong statistical estimation rates. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
the input design indeed matters, by showing that intuitive choices such as
i.i.d. Gaussian input leads to provably sub-optimal sample complexity. To
better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS
estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when
regularized approach improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow
impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample
complexity, (2) Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear
singular value gap that ease identification of the system order, (3) Hankel
regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. Finally, we
establish model selection guarantees through a joint train-validation procedure
where we tune the regularization parameter for near-optimal estimation.

This wedge pattern agrees with expectations of a tidal shell formed in a radial
merger and provides strong evidence in favor of predictions of Giant Stellar

orbital wrap of the tidal debris. The observed concentric wedge patterns of the
NE, West (W), and Southeast (SE) shelves corroborate this interpretation
independently of the models. We do not detect a kinematical signature in the NE
shelf region corresponding to an intact progenitor core, favoring GSS formation
models in which the progenitor is completely disrupted. The shelf's photometric
metallicity distribution implies that it is dominated by tidal material, as
opposed to the phase-mixed stellar halo or the disk. The metallicity
distribution ([Fe/H]$_{\rm phot}$ = $-0.42$ $\pm$ $0.01$) also matches the GSS,

extensively relied on large-sized annotations. However, manually AU labeling is
difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Most existing semi-supervised works
ignore the informative cues from the temporal domain, and are highly dependent
on densely annotated videos, making the learning process less efficient. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a deep semi-supervised framework
Knowledge-Spreader (KS), which differs from conventional methods in two
aspects. First, rather than only encoding human knowledge as constraints, KS
also learns the Spatial-Temporal AU correlation knowledge in order to
strengthen its out-of-distribution generalization ability. Second, we approach
KS by applying consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling in multiple
student networks alternately and dynamically. It spreads the spatial knowledge
from labeled frames to unlabeled data, and completes the temporal information
of partially labeled video clips. Thus, the design allows KS to learn AU
dynamics from video clips with only one label allocated, which significantly
reduce the requirements of using annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed KS achieves competitive performance as compared to the state
of the arts under the circumstances of using only 2% labels on BP4D and 5%
labels on DISFA. In addition, we test it on our newly developed large-scale
comprehensive emotion database, which contains considerable samples across
well-synchronized and aligned sensor modalities for easing the scarcity issue
of annotations and identities in human affective computing. The new database

hyperparameter tuning in learning-based deformable image registration.
Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization
to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based
approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly
estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the
accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the
choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter
search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training
multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to
suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning
strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on
deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts
the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby
comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field
corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast,
high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency
of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate
additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model
initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter
values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region,

The recently developed binary population synthesis code POSYDON incorporates
grids of MESA binary star simulations which are then interpolated to model
large-scale populations of massive binaries. The traditional method of
computing a high-density rectilinear grid of simulations is not scalable for
higher-dimension grids, accounting for a range of metallicities, rotation, and
eccentricity. We present a new active learning algorithm, psy-cris, which uses
machine learning in the data-gathering process to adaptively and iteratively
select targeted simulations to run, resulting in a custom, high-performance

sets require fewer simulations for accurate classification and regression than
either regular or randomly sampled grids. We further apply psy-cris to the
target problem of building a dynamic grid of MESA simulations, and we
demonstrate that, even without fine tuning, a simulation set of only $\sim 1/4$
the size of a rectilinear grid is sufficient to achieve the same classification
accuracy. We anticipate further gains when algorithmic parameters are optimized

Distributed algorithms can rely only on limited information from neighbours to
obtain an optimal solution for various optimization problems, such as optimal
power flow, unit commitment etc.
  As a generalization of these problems we consider the problem of
decentralized minimization of the smooth and convex partially separable
function $f = \sum_{k=1}^l f^k(x^k,\tilde x)$ under the coupled $\sum_{k=1}^l

  One way to handle the coupled constraints in a distributed manner is to
rewrite them in a distributed-friendly form using the Laplace matrix of the
communication graph and auxiliary variables (Khamisov, CDC, 2017). Instead of
using this method we reformulate the constrained optimization problem as a

game theory to explicitly model noncooperative interactions of multiple agents
in a known environment with perfect localization. Here, we present GTP-SLAM, a
novel, iterative best response-based SLAM algorithm that accurately performs
state localization and map reconstruction, while using game theoretic priors to
capture the inherent non-cooperative interactions among multiple agents in an
uncharted scene. By formulating the underlying SLAM problem as a potential
game, we inherit a strong convergence guarantee. Empirical results indicate
that, when deployed in a realistic traffic simulation, our approach performs
localization and mapping more accurately than a standard bundle adjustment
algorithm across a wide range of noise levels.

by integrating the encoder-decoder architecture from Masked Autoencoders are
Scalable Vision Learners (MAE) into the SSAST, where a deep encoder operates on
only unmasked input, and a shallow decoder operates on encoder outputs and mask
tokens. We find that MAE-like pretraining can provide a 3x speedup and 2x
memory usage reduction over the vanilla SSAST using current audio pretraining
strategies with ordinary model and input sizes. When fine-tuning on downstream
tasks, which only uses the encoder, we find that our approach outperforms the
SSAST on a variety of downstream tasks. We further conduct comprehensive
evaluations into different strategies of pretraining and explore differences in
MAE-style pretraining between the visual and audio domains.

used: (a) guided by physical intuition (such as local dependence of the

the field in both scenarios, but we can also use the data-driven PDEs to
propagate the field in time and achieve results in good agreement with the

molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) monolayer interacting with a periodic holey
silicon nitride substrate via van der Waals (vdW) forces. The MoS$_2$ layer is
modeled as a geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff-Love shell, and vdW forces are
modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, simplified using approximations for a
smooth substrate topography. The material parameters of the shell model are
calibrated by comparing small-strain tensile and bending tests with atomistic
simulations. This model is efficiently discretized using isogeometric analysis
(IGA) for the shell structure and a pseudo-time continuation method for energy
minimization. The IGA shell model is validated against fully-atomistic
calculations for several benchmark problems with different substrate
geometries. The continuum simulations reproduce deflections, strains and
curvatures predicted by atomistic simulations, which are known to strongly
affect the electronic properties of MoS$_2$, with deviations well below the
modeling errors suggested by differences between the widely-used reactive
empirical bond order and Stillinger-Weber interatomic potentials. Agreement
with atomistic results depends on geometric nonlinearity in some cases, but a
simple isotropic St. Venant-Kirchhoff model is found to be sufficient to
represent material behavior. We find that the IGA discretization of the
continuum model has a much lower computational cost than atomistic simulations,
and expect that it will enable efficient design space exploration in strain
engineering applications. This is demonstrated by studying the dependence of
strain and curvature in MoS$_2$ over a holey substrate as a function of the
hole spacing on scales inaccessible to atomistic calculations. The results show
an unexpected qualitative change in the deformation pattern below a critical
hole separation.

competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which
determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the

calculate an estimation ellipsoid set by updating the prediction ellipsoid set

cyberattacks based on the intersection between the ellipsoid sets. If there is
no intersection between the prediction set and the estimation set of an agent
at the current time instant, a cyberattack on its sensors is declared. Control
signal or communication signal data of an agent are under a cyberattack if its

Several data-driven auxiliary variable selection strategies have been proposed.
This paper uses a simulation study and a case study to provide a comprehensive

and in average stops at the original location. This phenomenon dubbed 'quantum
boomerang effect' (QBE) has been recently observed in an experiment simulating
the quantum kicked-rotor model [Phys. Rev. X 12, 011035 (2022)]. We provide
analytical arguments that support QBE in a wide class of disordered systems.
Sufficient conditions to observe the real-space QBE effect are (a) Anderson
localization, (b) the reality of the spectrum for the case of non-Hermitian
systems, (c) the ensemble of disorder realizations $\{H\}$ be invariant under
the application of $\mathcal{R\, T}$, and (d) the initial state is an
eigenvector of $\mathcal{R\, T}$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a reflection $x
\rightarrow -x$ and $\mathcal{T}$ is the time-reversal operator. The QBE can be
observed in momentum-space in systems with dynamical localization if conditions
(c) and (d) are satisfied with respect to the operator $\mathcal{T}$ instead of
$\mathcal{RT}$. These conditions allow the observation of the QBE in
time-reversal symmetry broken models, contrarily to what was expected from
previous analyses of the effect, and in a large class of non-Hermitian models.
We provide examples of QBE in lattice models with magnetic flux breaking
time-reversal symmetry and in a model with electric field. Whereas the QBE
straightforwardly applies to noninteracting many-body systems, we argue that a
real-space (momentum-space) QBE is absent in weakly interacting bosonic systems
due to the breaking of $RT$ ($T$) symmetry.

Without selective addressing of individual qubits, scalable implementation of
quantum algorithms is not possible. When the qubits are discrete points or
regions on a lattice, the selective addressing of magnetic spin qubits at the
nanoscale remains a challenge due to the difficulty of localizing and confining
a classical divergence-free field to a small volume of space. Herein we propose
a new technique for addressing spin qubits using voltage-control of nanoscale
magnetism, exemplified by the use of voltage control of magnetic anisotropy
(VCMA). We show that by tuning the frequency of the nanomagnet's electric field
drive to the Larmor frequency of the spins confined to a nanoscale volume, and
by modulating the phase of the drive, single-qubit quantum gates with
fidelities approaching those for fault-tolerant quantum computing can be
implemented. Such single-qubit gate operations have the advantage of remarkable
energy efficiency, requiring only tens of femto-Joules per gate operation, and
lossless, purely magnetic field control (no E-field over the target volume).
Their physical realization is also straightforward using existing foundry
manufacturing techniques.

dissipation occurred with information erasure in the quantum regime. While most
studies have related the entropy reduction incorporated with the erasure to the
lower bound~(entropic bound), recent efforts have also provided another lower
bound associated with the thermal fluctuation of the dissipated
energy~(thermodynamic bound). The coexistence of the two bounds has stimulated
comparative studies of their properties; however, these studies were performed
for systems where the time-evolution of diagonal (population) and off-diagonal
(coherence) elements of the density matrix are decoupled. In this paper, we
aimed to broaden the comparative study to include the influence of quantum
coherence induced by the tilted system--reservoir interaction direction. By
examining their dependence on the initial state of the information-bearing
system, we find that the following properties of the bounds are generically
held regardless of whether the influence of the coherence is present or not:
the entropic bound serves as the tighter bound for a sufficiently mixed initial
state, while the thermodynamic bound is tighter when the purity of the initial
state is sufficiently high. The exception is the case where the system dynamics
involve only phase relaxation; in this case, the two bounds coincide when the
initial coherence is zero; otherwise, the thermodynamic bound serves the
tighter bound. We also find the quantum information erasure inevitably
accompanies constant energy dissipation caused by the creation of
system--reservoir correlation, which may cause an additional source of
energetic cost for the erasure.

which can protect raw EEG signals containing sensitive privacy information
(e.g., identity, health and cognitive status). A novel cancellable EEG template
is developed based on EEG graph features and a non-invertible transform. The
proposed transformation provides cancellable templates, while taking advantage
of EEG elicitation protocol fusion to enhance biometric performance. The
proposed authentication system offers equivalent authentication performance
(8.58\% EER on a public database) as in the non-transformed domain, while
protecting raw EEG data. Furthermore, we analyze the system's capacity for
resisting multiple attacks, and discuss some overlooked but critical issues and
possible pitfalls involving hill-climbing attacks, second attacks, and

large-scale gravitational perturbations during cosmic inflation, has been shown
to omit an important physical effect in curved space-time, the nonlocal
entanglement among quantized modes from their gravitational effect on causal
structure. It is argued here that in a different model of quantum gravity that
coherently preserves nonlocal directional and causal relationships, primordial
perturbations originate instead from coherent quantum distortions of emergent
inflationary horizons; and moreover, that causal constraints account for
approximate symmetries of cosmic microwave background correlations measured at
large angular separations, which are highly anomalous in the standard picture.
Thus, symmetries already apparent in the large-angle CMB pattern may be unique

find that the anomaly cannot be explained by the usual three-body (2L1S and

mass ratios of the lens companions to the primary are $\sim 1.56 \times
10^{-3}$ and $\sim 1.75 \times 10^{-3}$, which correspond to $\sim 1.6$ and
$\sim 1.8$ times the Jupiter/Sun mass ratio, respectively, and therefore the
lens is a multiplanetary system containing two giant planets. With the
constraints of the event time-scale and angular Einstein radius, it is found
that the host of the lens system is a low-mass star of mid-to-late M spectral
type with a mass of $M_{\rm h} = 0.14^{+0.19}_{-0.07}~M_\odot$, and it hosts
two gas giant planets with masses of $M_{\rm p_1}=0.22^{+0.31}_{-0.12}~M_{\rm

0.15--2\,$M_{\odot}$ in several nearby star-forming regions. Sizes measured
from $^{12}$CO line emission span from 50 to 1000\,au. This range could be
explained by viscous evolution models with different $\alpha$ values (mostly of
$10^{-4}-10^{-3}$) and/or a spread of initial conditions. The CO sizes for most
disks are also consistent with MHD wind models that directly remove disk
angular momentum, but very large initial disk sizes would be required to
account for the very extended CO disks in the sample. As no CO size evolution
is observed across stellar ages of 0.5--20\,Myr in this sample, determining the
dominant mechanism of disk evolution will require a more complete sample for
both younger and more evolved systems. We find that the CO emission is
universally more extended than the continuum emission by an average factor of
$2.9\pm1.2$. The ratio of the CO to continuum sizes does not show any trend
with stellar mass, mm continuum luminosity, or the properties of substructures.
The GO Tau disk has the most extended CO emission in this sample, with an
extreme CO to continuum size ratio of 7.6. Seven additional disks in the sample

unitary jumps within an infinitesimal window of time. Although that restriction
may be avoided by the compound Poisson process, in most situations, we don't
have a closed expression for the probability distribution of the increments of
such processes, leaving us options such as working with probability generating
functions, numerical analysis and simulations. It is with this motivation in
mind, inspired by the recent developments of discrete distributions, that we
propose a new counting process based on the Bell-Touchard probability
distribution, naming it the Bell-Touchard process. We verify that the process
is a compound Poisson process, a multiple Poisson process and that it is closed
for convolution plus decomposition operations. Besides, we show that the
Bell-Touchard process arises naturally from the composition of two Poisson
processes. Moreover, we propose two generalizations; namely, the compound
Bell-Touchard process and the non-homogeneous Bell-Touchard process, showing
that the last one arises from the composition of a non-homogeneous Poisson
process along with a homogeneous Poisson process. We emphasize that since
previous works have been shown that the Bell-Touchard probability distribution
can be used quite effectively for modelling count data, the Bell-Touchard
process and its generalizations may contribute to the formulation of
mathematical treatable models where the rare events hypothesis is not suitable.

for precision metrology, timekeeping, and manipulation of quantum systems. Such
frequency stability typically relies on bulk-optic lasers and reference
cavities, where increased size is leveraged to improve noise performance, but
with the trade-off of cost, hand assembly, and limited application
environments. On the other hand, planar waveguide lasers and cavities exploit
the benefits of CMOS scalability but are fundamentally limited from achieving
hertz-level linewidths at longer times by stochastic noise and thermal
sensitivity inherent to the waveguide medium. These physical limits have
inhibited the development of compact laser systems with frequency noise
required for portable optical clocks that have performance well beyond
conventional microwave counterparts. In this work, we break this paradigm to
demonstrate a compact, high-coherence laser system at 1548 nm with a 1 s
integrated linewidth of 1.1 Hz and fractional frequency instability less than
10$^{-14}$ from 1 ms to 1 s. The frequency noise at 1 Hz offset is suppressed
by 11 orders of magnitude from that of the free-running diode laser down to the
cavity thermal noise limit near 1 Hz$^2$/Hz, decreasing to 10$^{-3}$ Hz$^2$/Hz
at 4 kHz offset. This low noise performance leverages wafer-scale integrated
lasers together with an 8 mL vacuum-gap cavity that employs micro-fabricated
mirrors with sub-angstrom roughness to yield an optical $Q$ of 11.8 billion.
Significantly, all the critical components are lithographically defined on
planar substrates and hold the potential for parallel high-volume

band structures using symmetry eigenvalue indicated methods. Recently, however,
there has been increasing theoretical and experimental interest in multi-gap
dependent topological phases that cannot be captured by this paradigm. These
topologies arise by braiding band degeneracies that reside between different
bands and carry non-Abelian charges due to the presence of either $C_2T$ or
$PT$ symmetry, culminating in different invariants such as $\mathbb{Z}$-valued
Euler class. Here, we present a universal formulation for Euler phases
motivated by their homotopy classification that is related to the
Skyrmion-profile of a single unit-vector in three-level systems, and that of
two unit-vectors in four-level systems. In addition, upon employing the
strategy of systematically building 3D models from a pair of sub-dimensional
Euler phases, we show that phase transitions between any two inequivalent Euler
phases are mediated by the presence of adjacent (in-gap) nodal rings linked
with sub-gap nodal lines, forming trajectories corresponding to the braiding or
debraiding of nodal points. The stability of the linked adjacent nodal rings is
furthermore demonstrated to be indicated by an Euler class monopole charge
matching with its $\mathbb{Z}$-valued linking numbers. We finally also
systematically address the conversion of Euler phases into descendant Chern
phases upon breaking the $C_2T$ or $PT$ symmetry. All the topological phases
discussed in this work are corroborated with explicit minimal lattice models.
These models can themselves directly serve as an extra impetus for experimental
searches or be employed for theoretical studies, thereby underpinning the
upcoming of this nascent pursuit.

measures and evaluates the word-level patterns that PLMs depend on to generate

the missing words: knowledge-dependent, positionally close, and highly

more by the positionally close and highly co-occurred words than the

contribute to the measured vacuum energy that do not transcend the observable
volume. Since all quantised field modes have various observable consequences,
when a gravitational horizon causally confines an observer to a finite volume
quantised modes should be restricted to the observable patch to remain
consistent with gravity.
  Within the observable patch of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
space the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor can be
expressed as a sum over discrete field modes. Friedmann's first equation
provides a straightforward ultraviolet cut-off allowing only a finite number of
modes in the sum. The finite volume acts as an infrared regulator and the
calculation of the vacuum energy density is tractable without regularisation
and renormalisation.
  To test the validity of this idea I quantise a scalar field on an FLRW
background and calculate its vacuum energy density in the vacuum dominated,
conformal, holographic limit. In this limit I show that the quantum vacuum
energy density scales with the square of the Hubble parameter, consistently
with gravity. In this example quantum vacuum expands space while the horizon of
the expanding space limits the energy density of the vacuum to the observed
value.

its effectiveness, which usually consists of a beamforming front-end and a

due to the integration of multiple modules, particularly considering that
multi-channel speech data recorded in real environments are limited in size.
This raises the demand to exploit the single-channel data for multi-channel
end-to-end ASR. In this paper, we systematically compare the performance of
three schemes to exploit external single-channel data for multi-channel
end-to-end ASR, namely back-end pre-training, data scheduling, and data
simulation, under different settings such as the sizes of the single-channel
data and the choices of the front-end. Extensive experiments on CHiME-4 and
AISHELL-4 datasets demonstrate that while all three methods improve the
multi-channel end-to-end speech recognition performance, data simulation
outperforms the other two, at the cost of longer training time. Data scheduling
outperforms back-end pre-training marginally but nearly consistently,
presumably because that in the pre-training stage, the back-end tends to
overfit on the single-channel data, especially when the single-channel data
size is small.

action recognition due to their powerful ability to model data topology. We
argue that the performance of recent proposed skeleton-based action recognition
methods is limited by the following factors. First, the predefined graph
structures are shared throughout the network, lacking the flexibility and
capacity to model the multi-grain semantic information. Second, the relations
among the global joints are not fully exploited by the graph local convolution,
which may lose the implicit joint relevance. For instance, actions such as
running and waving are performed by the co-movement of body parts and joints,
e.g., legs and arms, however, they are located far away in physical connection.
Inspired by the recent attention mechanism, we propose a multi-grain contextual
focus module, termed MCF, to capture the action associated relation information
from the body joints and parts. As a result, more explainable representations
for different skeleton action sequences can be obtained by MCF. In this study,
we follow the common practice that the dense sample strategy of the input
skeleton sequences is adopted and this brings much redundancy since number of
instances has nothing to do with actions. To reduce the redundancy, a temporal
discrimination focus module, termed TDF, is developed to capture the local
sensitive points of the temporal dynamics. MCF and TDF are integrated into the
standard GCN network to form a unified architecture, named STF-Net. It is noted
that STF-Net provides the capability to capture robust movement patterns from
these skeleton topology structures, based on multi-grain context aggregation
and temporal dependency. Extensive experimental results show that our STF-Net
significantly achieves state-of-the-art results on three challenging benchmarks

by a self-attention encoder, which enables flexible and adaptive interactions
between the two modalities in the fusion process. The fused features are fed to
a segmentation module, which works adaptively according to the image and

Keypoints-Skeleton-Shape prediction manner. Specifically, our method completes
missing topology using three steps: 1) Aligned Keypoint Localization. An
asymmetric keypoint locator, including an unsupervised multi-scale keypoint
detector and a complete keypoint generator, is proposed for localizing aligned
keypoints from complete and partial point clouds. We theoretically prove that
the detector can capture aligned keypoints for objects within a sub-category.
2) Surface-skeleton Generation. A new type of skeleton, named Surface-skeleton,
is generated from keypoints based on geometric priors to fully represent the
topological information captured from keypoints and better recover the local
details. 3) Shape Refinement. We design a refinement subnet where multi-scale
surface-skeletons are fed into each recursive skeleton-assisted refinement
module to assist the completion process. Experimental results show that our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on point cloud completion.

labor. Recently, prompting in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been found
to be an efficient technique to leverage pre-trained language models (LMs).
Specifically, prompt tuning optimizes a limited number of task-specific
parameters with a fixed pre-trained model; as a result, only a small set of
parameters is needed to be stored for each task. Prompt tuning improves
computation and memory efficiency by leveraging the pre-trained LM's prediction
ability. Nevertheless, such a paradigm is little studied in the speech

competitive performance in speech classification tasks with fewer trainable

images for cross-modal retrieval, while sometimes the scene text appearing in
images can provide valuable information to understand the visual semantics.
Most of existing cross-modal retrieval approaches ignore the usage of scene
text information and directly adding this information may lead to performance
degradation in scene text free scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a
full transformer architecture to unify these cross-modal retrieval scenarios in
a single $\textbf{Vi}$sion and $\textbf{S}$cene $\textbf{T}$ext
$\textbf{A}$ggregation framework (ViSTA). Specifically, ViSTA utilizes
transformer blocks to directly encode image patches and fuse scene text
embedding to learn an aggregated visual representation for cross-modal
retrieval. To tackle the modality missing problem of scene text, we propose a
novel fusion token based transformer aggregation approach to exchange the
necessary scene text information only through the fusion token and concentrate
on the most important features in each modality. To further strengthen the
visual modality, we develop dual contrastive learning losses to embed both
image-text pairs and fusion-text pairs into a common cross-modal space.
Compared to existing methods, ViSTA enables to aggregate relevant scene text
semantics with visual appearance, and hence improve results under both scene
text free and scene text aware scenarios. Experimental results show that ViSTA
outperforms other methods by at least $\bf{8.4}\%$ at Recall@1 for scene text
aware retrieval task. Compared with state-of-the-art scene text free retrieval
methods, ViSTA can achieve better accuracy on Flicker30K and MSCOCO while
running at least three times faster during the inference stage, which validates

end-to-end deep learning approaches named Weakly Supervised Patch Label
Inference Networks (WSPLIN) for efficiently addressing these tasks under
various application settings. WSPLIN transforms the fully supervised pavement
image classification problem into a weakly supervised pavement patch
classification problem for solutions. Specifically, WSPLIN first divides the
pavement image under different scales into patches with different collection
strategies and then employs a Patch Label Inference Network (PLIN) to infer the
labels of these patches to fully exploit the resolution and scale information.
Notably, we design a patch label sparsity constraint based on the prior
knowledge of distress distribution and leverage the Comprehensive Decision
Network (CDN) to guide the training of PLIN in a weakly supervised way.
Therefore, the patch labels produced by PLIN provide interpretable intermediate
information, such as the rough location and the type of distress. We evaluate
our method on a large-scale bituminous pavement distress dataset named CQU-BPDD

TrajGen, a two-stage trajectory generation framework, which can capture more
realistic behaviors directly from human demonstration. In particular, TrajGen
consists of the multi-modal trajectory prediction stage and the reinforcement
learning based trajectory modification stage. In the first stage, we propose a
novel auxiliary RouteLoss for the trajectory prediction model to generate

reinforcement learning is used to track the predicted trajectories while
avoiding collisions, which can improve the feasibility of generated
trajectories. In addition, we develop a data-driven simulator I-Sim that can be
used to train reinforcement learning models in parallel based on naturalistic
driving data. The vehicle model in I-Sim can guarantee that the generated
trajectories by TrajGen satisfy vehicle kinematic constraints. Finally, we give
comprehensive metrics to evaluate generated trajectories for simulation

schemes not only have high computational cost but, by comparing patches at
predetermined locations, they neglect the motion dynamics in the video. In this
paper, we introduce the Deformable Video Transformer (DVT), which dynamically
predicts a small subset of video patches to attend for each query location

directly with respect to classification performance, thus eliminating the need
for suboptimal hand-design of attention strategies. Experiments on four

  Access Networks with Covert Communications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rate Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has recently emerged as a promising
technique to enhance the transmission rate for multiple access networks. Unlike
conventional multiple access schemes, RSMA requires splitting and transmitting
messages at different rates. The joint optimization of the power allocation and
rate control at the transmitter is challenging given the uncertainty and
dynamics of the environment. Furthermore, securing transmissions in RSMA
networks is a crucial problem because the messages transmitted can be easily
exposed to adversaries. This work first proposes a stochastic optimization
framework that allows the transmitter to adaptively adjust its power and
transmission rates allocated to users, and thereby maximizing the sum-rate and
fairness of the system under the presence of an adversary. We then develop a
highly effective learning algorithm that can help the transmitter to find the
optimal policy without requiring complete information about the environment in
advance. Extensive simulations show that our proposed scheme can achieve
positive covert transmission rates in the finite blocklength regime and
non-saturating rates at high SNR values. More significantly, our achievable
covert rate can be increased at high SNR values (i.e., 20 dB to 40 dB),
compared with saturating rates of a conventional multiple access scheme.

policymaker knows the cost of private information and adopts an optimal

established the Low Surface Brightness Galaxies Auto Detect model (LSBG-AD),
which is a data-driven model for end-to-end detection of LSB galaxies from
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. Object detection techniques based on
deep learning are applied to the SDSS field images to identify LSB galaxies and
estimate their coordinates at the same time. Applying LSBG-AD to 1120 SDSS
images, we detected 1197 LSB galaxy candidates, of which 1081 samples are
already known and 116 samples are newly found candidates. The B-band central
surface brightness of the candidates searched by the model ranges from 22 mag
arcsec $^ {- 2} $ to 24 mag arcsec $^ {- 2} $, quite consistent with the

on the propagation of ion-acoustic waves (IAWs) has been carried out in
hydrogen plasma containing two-temperature electrons and dust grains. A
low-pressure hot cathode discharge method is opted for plasma production. The
desired two electron groups with distinct temperatures are achieved by
inserting two magnetic cages with a cusp-shaped magnetic field of different
surface field strengths in the same chamber. The dust grains are dropped into
the plasma with the help of a dust dropper, which gain negative charges by
interacting with the plasma. The IAWs are excited with the help of a mesh-grid
inserted into the plasma. A planar Langmuir probe is used as a detector to
detect the IAWs. The time of flight technique has been applied to measure the
phase velocity of the IAWs. The results suggest that in the presence of a
magnetic field, the phase velocity of IAWs increases, whereas introducing the
dust particles leads to the lower phase velocity. The magnetic field is
believed to have a significant effect on the wave damping. This study will aid
in utilising IAWs as a diagnostic tool to estimate plasma parameters in the
presence of an external magnetic field. Moreover, the study might be useful for
estimating the relative ion concentrations in a two positive ion species
plasma, as well as the relative concentration of the negative ions in the

  manuscript",,,,"cs.GT econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In today's online advertising markets, it is common for an advertiser to set
a long-period budget. Correspondingly, advertising platforms adopt budget
control methods to ensure that an advertiser's payment is within her budget.
Most budget control methods rely on the value distributions of advertisers.
However, the platform hardly learns their true priors due to the complex
environment advertisers stand in and privacy issues. Therefore, it is essential
to understand how budget control auction mechanisms perform under unassured
priors.
  This work answers this problem from multiple aspects. Specifically, we
discuss five budget-constrained parameterized mechanisms: bid-discount/pacing
first-price auctions, the Bayesian revenue-optimal auction and
bid-discount/pacing second-price auctions. We consider the game among the
seller and all buyers induced by these five mechanisms in the stochastic model.
We restrict the discussion to efficient mechanisms in which the seller earns
buyers' budgets sufficiently, and thus, leads to his high revenue. Our main
result shows the strategic equivalence between the Bayesian revenue-optimal
mechanism and the efficient bid-discount first-price mechanism. A broad
equivalence among all these (efficient) mechanisms is also given in the
symmetric case. We further dig into the structural properties of stochastic
budget-constrained mechanisms. We characterize sufficient and necessary
conditions on the efficient parameter tuple for bid-discount/pacing first-price
auctions. Meanwhile, when buyers do not take strategic behaviors, we exploit
the dominance relationships of these mechanisms by revealing their intrinsic
structures.

determined from the shift of the Bragg peaks and from the anomaly in the
resistivity. The critical pressure, $P_{\rm s}$ $\sim$ 4.9 GPa at 300 K,
decreases to $P_{\rm s}$ $\sim$ 3.6 GPa at 10 K. The decrease of $P_{\rm s}$ is
due not only to the decrease in volume of the unit cell but also to an
anisotropic shrinkage by cooling. When crossing the boundary to the
high-pressure phase, the resistivity shows a significant drop to exhibit a
metallic temperature dependence. The results of this study strongly suggest
that the structural phase transition can be ascribed to valence instability of

  Problems","22 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the online stochastic resource allocation problem (RAP)
with chance constraints and conditional expectation constraints. The online RAP
is an integer linear programming problem where resource consumption
coefficients are revealed column by column along with the corresponding revenue
coefficients. When a column is revealed, the corresponding decision variables
are determined instantaneously without future information. In online
applications, the resource consumption coefficients are often obtained by
prediction. An application for such scenario rises from the online order
fulfilment task. When the timeliness constraints are considered, the
coefficients are generated by the prediction for the transportation time from
origin to destination. To model their uncertainties, we take the chance
constraints and conditional expectation constraints into the consideration.
Assuming that the uncertain variables have known Gaussian distributions, the
stochastic RAP can be transformed into a deterministic but nonlinear problem
with integer second-order cone constraints. Next, we linearize this nonlinear
problem and theoretically analyze the performance of vanilla online primal-dual
algorithm for solving the linearized stochastic RAP. Under mild technical
assumptions, the optimality gap and constraint violation are both on the order
of $\sqrt{n}$. Then, to further improve the performance of the algorithm,
several modified online primal-dual algorithms with heuristic corrections are
proposed. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the
applicability and effectiveness of our methods.

$Z\gamma Z^\ast$ only the $CP$-conserving form factor $h_3^Z$ is generated.
Constrains on the $Z\overline{t}c$ couplings are obtained from the most recent
limits on the branching ratio $t\rightarrow Zq$ decays. Our new bounds are
$|g_{\text{V}}^{tu}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tu}|\leqslant 0.011$ and
$|g_{\text{V}}^{tc}|\text{,}|g_{\text{A}}^{tc}|\leqslant 0.016$ in terms of the

limits are tighter than those reported in the literature. It is found that the
relevant contributions for the real part of the $CP$-conserving form factor
arise from the quarks up and down, whereas the imaginary part only receives
non-vanishing contributions from quarks up. Our results are in general of order
$10^{-6}-10^{-7}$, but they could be one order of magnitude bigger for the

turbulent flows have been developed based on the assumption of local isotropy
and use the Kolmogorov constant that correlates the spectral distribution of
turbulent kinetic energy with the turbulent dissipation rate. Many turbulence
models (Stochastic and LES models) use the Kolmogorov constant in the
formulation. Compilation of a large number of experimental data for different
flow configurations has revealed that the Kolmogorov constant is independent of
Reynolds number in the limit of high Reynolds number (Sreenivasan, 1995).
However, several numerical studies at low and intermediate Reynolds numbers
which address the flow situations of practical importance consider that the
Kolmogorov constant remains unchanged irrespective of whether the flow is
single phase or multiphase. In the present work, we assess the variation of
local isotropy of fluid fluctuations with the increase in particle loading in
particle-laden turbulent channel flows. We also estimate the Kolmogorov
constant using second-order velocity structure functions and compensated
spectra in case of low Reynolds number turbulent flows. Our study reveals that
the Kolmogorov constant decreases in the channel center with an increase in the
particle volume fraction for the range of Reynolds number investigated here.
The estimated variation of the Kolmogorov constant is used to express the
Smagorinsky coefficient as a function of solid loading in particle-laden flows.
Then, a new modeling technique is adopted using the large eddy simulation (LES)
to predict the fluid phase statistics without solving simultaneous particle
phase equations. This new methodology also helps understand the drastic
decrease in turbulence intensity at critical particle volume loading.

challenging task for 3D scene understanding. This task requires not only to
recognize each instance in the scene, but also to recover their geometries
based on the partial observed point cloud. Existing methods usually attempt to
directly predict occupancy values of the complete object based on incomplete
point cloud proposals from a detection-based backbone. However, this framework
always fails to reconstruct high fidelity mesh due to the obstruction of
various detected false positive object proposals and the ambiguity of
incomplete point observations for learning occupancy values of complete
objects. To circumvent the hurdle, we propose a Disentangled Instance Mesh
Reconstruction (DIMR) framework for effective point scene understanding. A
segmentation-based backbone is applied to reduce false positive object
proposals, which further benefits our exploration on the relationship between
recognition and reconstruction. Based on the accurate proposals, we leverage a
mesh-aware latent code space to disentangle the processes of shape completion
and mesh generation, relieving the ambiguity caused by the incomplete point
observations. Furthermore, with access to the CAD model pool at test time, our
model can also be used to improve the reconstruction quality by performing mesh
retrieval without extra training. We thoroughly evaluate the reconstructed mesh
quality with multiple metrics, and demonstrate the superiority of our method on
the challenging ScanNet dataset. Code is available at

speech recognition (SA-ASR) in the multi-party meeting scenario, a topic with
increasing attention in meeting rich transcription. Specifically, three
approaches are evaluated in this study. The first approach, FD-SOT, consists of
a frame-level diarization model to identify speakers and a multi-talker ASR to
recognize utterances. The speaker-attributed transcriptions are obtained by
aligning the diarization results and recognized hypotheses. However, such an
alignment strategy may suffer from erroneous timestamps due to the modular
independence, severely hindering the model performance. Therefore, we propose
the second approach, WD-SOT, to address alignment errors by introducing a
word-level diarization model, which can get rid of such timestamp alignment
dependency. To further mitigate the alignment issues, we propose the third
approach, TS-ASR, which trains a target-speaker separation module and an ASR
module jointly. By comparing various strategies for each SA-ASR approach,
experimental results on a real meeting scenario corpus, AliMeeting, reveal that
the WD-SOT approach achieves 10.7% relative reduction on averaged
speaker-dependent character error rate (SD-CER), compared with the FD-SOT
approach. In addition, the TS-ASR approach also outperforms the FD-SOT approach
and brings 16.5% relative average SD-CER reduction.

properties of their stellar winds. Single non-magnetic OB stars have an X-ray
luminosity that scales with their bolometric luminosity and their emission is
thought to arise from a distribution of wind-embedded shocks. The lack of
significant short-term stochastic variability indicates that the winds consist
of a large number of independent fragments. Detailed variability studies
unveiled a connection between the photosphere and the wind: well-studied O-type
stars exhibit a ~ 10% modulation of their emission on timescales consistent
with the rotation period, and a few early B-type pulsators display ~ 10%
modulations of their X-ray flux with the pulsation period. Unlike OB stars,
their evolved descendants (WR and LBV stars) lack a well-defined relation
between their X-ray and bolometric luminosities, and several subcategories of
objects remain undetected. These properties most likely stem from the combined
effects of wind optical depth and wind velocity. Magnetic OB stars display an
enhanced X-ray emission frequently modulated by the rotation of the star. These
properties are well explained by the magnetically confined wind shock model and
an oblique magnetic rotator configuration. Some massive binaries display
phase-dependent excess emission arising from the collision between the winds of
the binary components. Yet, the majority of the massive binaries do not show
such an emission, probably as a consequence of radiative cooling of the
shock-heated plasma. Finally, a growing subset of the Be stars, the so-called
gamma Cas stars, feature an unusually hard and strong thermal X-ray emission
that varies over a wide range of timescales. Several scenarios have been
proposed to explain these properties, but the origin of the phenomenon remains
currently one of the major unsolved puzzles in stellar X-ray astrophysics.

signal quality, i.e., SI-SDR, we introduce a multi-resolution delta spectrum
loss in the frequency-domain, to ensure the continuity of an extracted speech
signal, thus alleviating the over-suppression. We examine the hybrid continuity
loss function using a time-domain audio-visual speaker extraction algorithm on

in MagicData-RAMC are classified into 15 diversified domains and tagged with
topic labels, ranging from science and technology to ordinary life. Accurate
transcription and precise speaker voice activity timestamps are manually
labeled for each sample. Speakers' detailed information is also provided. As a
Mandarin speech dataset designed for dialog scenarios with high quality and
rich annotations, MagicData-RAMC enriches the data diversity in the Mandarin

each user can access multiple caches and each cache can serve multiple users is
considered in this paper. Most of the literature in multi-access coded caching
focuses on cyclic wrap-around cache access where each user is allowed to access
an exclusive set of consecutive caches only. In this paper, a more general
framework of multi-access caching problem is considered in which each user is
allowed to randomly connect to a specific number of caches and multiple users
can access the same set of caches. For the proposed system model considering
decentralized prefetching, a new delivery scheme is proposed and an expression
for per user delivery rate is obtained. A lower bound on the delivery rate is
derived using techniques from index coding. The proposed scheme is shown to be
optimal among all the linear schemes under certain conditions. An improved
delivery rate and a lower bound for the decentralized multi-access coded
caching scheme with cyclic wrap-around cache access can be obtained as a
special case. By giving specific values to certain parameters, the results of
decentralized shared caching scheme and of conventional decentralized caching
scheme can be recovered.

  Counseling Session","Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2022",,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Counseling typically takes the form of spoken conversation between a
therapist and a client. The empathy level expressed by the therapist is
considered to be an essential quality factor of counseling outcome. This paper
proposes a hierarchical recurrent network combined with two-level attention
mechanisms to determine the therapist's empathy level solely from the acoustic
features of conversational speech in a counseling session. The experimental
results show that the proposed model can achieve an accuracy of $72.1\%$ in
classifying the therapist's empathy level as being ``high"" or ``low"". It is
found that the speech from both the therapist and the client are contributing
to predicting the empathy level that is subjectively rated by an expert
observer. By analyzing speaker turns assigned with high attention weights, it
is observed that $2$ to $6$ consecutive turns should be considered together to
provide useful clues for detecting empathy, and the observer tends to take the
whole session into consideration when rating the therapist empathy, instead of
relying on a few specific speaker turns.

understand the effect of nonequilibrium on collective behaviors. It has long
been established that activity can create effective attractions leading to
motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), whose role is similar to that of
(inverse) temperature in the simplest equilibrium system with attractive
inter-particle interactions. Here, our theoretical analysis based on a kinetic
theory of MIPS shows that a new type of activity-induced nonequilibrium
vaporization is able to hinder the formation of dense phase when activity is
large enough. Such nonequilibrium vaporization along with the activity-induced
effective attraction thus lead to a MIPS reentrance. Numerical simulations
verify such nonequilibrium effect induced solely by activity on phase behaviors
of ABPs, and further demonstrate the dependence of MIPS on activity and the
strength of inter-particle interaction predicted by our theoretical analysis.
Our findings highlight the unique role played by the nonequilibrium nature of
activity on phase behaviors of active systems, which may inspire deep insights
into the essential difference between equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems.

eliminating the geometric distortion in document images for document

readability by taking the text lines and the document boundaries into account
from a constrained optimization perspective. Specifically, our proposed method
first learns the boundary points and the pixels in the text lines and then
follows the most simple observation that the boundaries and text lines in both
horizontal and vertical directions should be kept after dewarping to introduce
a novel grid regularization scheme. To obtain the final forward mapping for
dewarping, we solve an optimization problem with our proposed grid

based on accuracy and F1 score have become the de facto standard to measure the
performance of lane detection methods. While they have played a major role in
improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this
evaluation method in downstream tasks has not been adequately researched. In
this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection:
End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on
the requirements of autonomous driving, a core downstream task of lane
detection; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight
surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evaluate the validity of the metrics, we conduct
a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection approaches
on the TuSimple dataset and our newly constructed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our
results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations
($\leq$-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improvements purely
targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements
in autonomous driving, but rather may actually have made it worse by
overfitting to the conventional metrics. As autonomous driving is a
security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the
sound development of practical lane detection models. We hope that our study
will help the community achieve more downstream task-aware evaluations for lane
detection.

Methods to automatically mitigate fake news propagation have been proposed.
Some studies focus on selecting top k influential users on social networks as

mitigation information propagation as expected. Other studies assume a given
set of debunkers and focus on optimizing intensity for debunkers to publish
true news, but as debunkers are fixed, even if with high social influence
and/or high intensity to post true news, the true news may not reach users

paper, we propose the multi-stage fake news mitigation campaign where debunkers
are dynamically selected within budget at each stage. We formulate it as a
reinforcement learning problem and propose a greedy algorithm optimized by
predicting future states so that the debunkers can be selected in a way that
maximizes the overall mitigation effect. We conducted extensive experiments on

applications, but usually suffer from the long-standing user cold-start
problem. As a promising way, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) has attracted a
surge of interest, which aims to transfer the user preferences observed in the
source domain to make recommendations in the target domain. Previous CDR
approaches mostly achieve the goal by following the Embedding and Mapping
(EMCDR) idea which attempts to learn a mapping function to transfer the
pre-trained user representations (embeddings) from the source domain into the
target domain. However, they pre-train the user/item representations
independently for each domain, ignoring to consider both domain interactions
simultaneously. Therefore, the biased pre-trained representations inevitably
involve the domain-specific information which may lead to negative impact to
transfer information across domains. In this work, we consider a key point of
the CDR task: what information needs to be shared across domains? To achieve
the above idea, this paper utilizes the information bottleneck (IB) principle,
and proposes a novel approach termed as CDRIB to enforce the representations
encoding the domain-shared information. To derive the unbiased representations,
we devise two IB regularizers to model the cross-domain/in-domain user-item
interactions simultaneously and thereby CDRIB could consider both domain
interactions jointly for de-biasing.

by a hierarchical centralized coordination scheme that successively optimizes
the crossing order and velocity trajectories of a group of vehicles so as to
minimize their total energy consumption and travel time required to pass the

the vehicle modeling framework in this paper captures 1) friction losses that

optimization problem subject to safety constraints for powertrain operation,
cornering and collision avoidance, after convexification and relaxation in some
aspects can be formulated as two second-order cone programs, which ensures a
rapid solution search and a unique global optimum. Simulation case studies are
provided showing the tightness of the convex relaxation bounds, the overall
effectiveness of the proposed approach, and its advantages over a benchmark

of Pareto optimal solutions for the two objectives (travel time and energy

these rare events may have high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the large

minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of the
challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic

Using a canonical space enables our method to learn shared properties of human

connect the canonical space with input and target images and query image
features for radiance and density prediction. We leverage the parametric 3D

quite well in practice when combined with our canonical NeRF. The experiments

originate in a cataclysmic event that occurs in a binary system composed of a
carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion in close orbit. The
collapse of the CO star generates at its center a newborn NS ($\nu$NS), and a
supernova (SN) explosion. Matter from the ejecta is accreted both onto the
$\nu$NS because of fallback and onto the NS companion, leading to the collapse
of the latter into a black hole (BH). Each of the ingredients of the above
system leads to observable emission episodes in a GRB. In particular, the
$\nu$NS is expected to show up (hereafter $\nu$NS-rise) in the early GRB
emission, nearly contemporary or superimposed to the ultrarelativistic prompt
emission (UPE) phase, but with a different spectral signature. Following the
$\nu$NS-rise, the $\nu$NS powers the afterglow emission by injecting energy
into the expanding ejecta leading to synchrotron radiation. We here show that
the $\nu$NS-rise and the subsequent afterglow emission in both systems, GRB
180720B and GRB 190114C, are powered by the release of rotational energy of a
Maclaurin spheroid, starting from the bifurcation point to the Jacobi ellipsoid
sequence. This implies that the $\nu$NS evolves from a triaxial Jacobi
configuration, prior to the $\nu$NS-rise, into the axially symmetric Maclaurin
configuration observed in the GRB. The triaxial $\nu$NS configuration is
short-lived (less than a second) due to a copious emission of gravitational
waves, before the GRB emission, and it could be in principle detected for
sources located at distances closer than $100$ Mpc. This appears to be a
specific process of emission of gravitational waves in the BdHN I powering long
GRBs.

switching time. Unexpectedly, these properties were now observed in multiaxial
polycrystalline ferroelectrics, exhibiting a number of parallel and sequential
non-180{\deg}-switching processes with distinct switching times. This behaviour
can be explained by a combination of the multistep stochastic mechanism and the
inhomogeneous field mechanism models of polarization reversal. Scaling
properties are predicted for polycrystalline ferroelectrics of tetragonal,
rhombohedral and orthorhombic symmetries and exemplarily demonstrated by
measurements of polarization kinetics in (K,Na)NbO3-based ferroelectric ceramic
over a timescale of 7 orders of magnitude. Dynamic scaling properties allow
insight into the microscopic switching mechanisms, on the one hand, and into
statistical material characteristics, on the other hand, providing thereby the
description of temporal polarization with high accuracy. The gained deeper
insight into the mechanisms of multistep polarization switching is crucial for
future ultrafast and multilevel digital information storage.

significantly, according to several different descriptions of the interatomic

are generated using the same structural motifs and are similarly found to be
more stable than Mackay icosahedra. The lowest energy per atom is obtained with

regarding multiple-IRS-assisted systems. This paper investigates the analysis
and optimization of a double-IRS cooperatively assisted downlink system, where
a multi-antenna base station (BS) serves a single-antenna user with the help of
two multi-element IRSs, connected by an inter-IRS channel. The channel between
any two nodes is modeled with Rician fading. The BS adopts the instantaneous
CSI-adaptive maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) beamformer, and the two IRSs
adopt a cooperative quasi-static phase shift design. The goal is to maximize
the average achievable rate, which can be reflected by the average channel
power of the equivalent channel between the BS and user, at a low phase
adjustment cost and computational complexity. First, we obtain tractable
expressions of the average channel power of the equivalent channel in the
general Rician factor, pure line of sight (LoS), and pure non-line of sight
(NLoS) regimes, respectively. Then, we jointly optimize the phase shifts of the
two IRSs to maximize the average channel power of the equivalent channel in
these regimes. The optimization problems are challenging non-convex problems.
We obtain globally optimal closed-form solutions for some cases and propose
computationally efficient iterative algorithms to obtain stationary points for
the other cases. Next, we compare the computational complexity for optimizing
the phase shifts and the optimal average channel power of the double-IRS
cooperatively assisted system with those of a counterpart single-IRS-assisted
system at a large number of reflecting elements in the three regimes. Finally,
we numerically demonstrate notable gains of the proposed solutions over the
existing solutions at different system parameters.

corresponding pixels between two images. Despite the tremendous progress of
deep learning-based optical flow methods, it remains a challenge to accurately
estimate large displacements with motion blur. This is mainly because the
correlation volume, the basis of pixel matching, is computed as the dot product
of the convolutional features of the two images. The locality of convolutional
features makes the computed correlations susceptible to various noises. On
large displacements with motion blur, noisy correlations could cause severe
errors in the estimated flow. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new
architecture ""CRoss-Attentional Flow Transformer"" (CRAFT), aiming to revitalize
the correlation volume computation. In CRAFT, a Semantic Smoothing Transformer
layer transforms the features of one frame, making them more global and
semantically stable. In addition, the dot-product correlations are replaced
with transformer Cross-Frame Attention. This layer filters out feature noises
through the Query and Key projections, and computes more accurate correlations.
On Sintel (Final) and KITTI (foreground) benchmarks, CRAFT has achieved new
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, to test the robustness of different
models on large motions, we designed an image shifting attack that shifts input
images to generate large artificial motions. Under this attack, CRAFT performs
much more robustly than two representative methods, RAFT and GMA. The code of

joint has not been investigated before. The objective of this study was to
develop a biomechanical model that can predict the surgery's impact on the
patellar position and find the correlation between the opening angles and the
patellar position after the surgery. A combined finite element and multibody
model of the lower limb was developed. The model's capabilities for predicting
the patellofemoral kinematics were evaluated by performing a passive deep
flexion simulation of the native knee and comparing the outcomes with magnetic
resonance images of the study subject at various flexion angles. The model at a
fixed knee flexion angle was then used to simulate the high tibial osteotomy
surgery virtually. The results showed a correlation between the wedge opening
angles and the patellar position in various degrees of freedom. These results
indicate that larger wedge openings result in increased values of patellar
distalization, lateral patellar shift, patellar rotation, and patellar internal
tilt. The developed model in this study can be used in future studies to
monitor the stress distribution on the patellar cartilage and connecting
tissues to investigate their relationship with observations of pain and
cartilage injury due to post-operative altered patellar kinematics.

a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which

requires the protection of patient confidentiality via data anonymisation. The
objective of this work is to calculate the risk of re-identification arising
from a malicious attack to an anonymised dataset, as described below. Methods:
We first present an analytical means of estimating the probability of
re-identification of a single patient in a k-anonymised dataset of Electronic
Health Record (EHR) data. Second, we generalize this solution to obtain the
probability of multiple patients being re-identified. We provide synthetic
validation via Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the
estimates obtained. Results: The proposed analytical framework for risk
estimation provides re-identification probabilities that are in agreement with
those provided by simulation in a number of scenarios. Our work is limited by
conservative assumptions which inflate the re-identification probability.
Discussion: Our estimates show that the re-identification probability increases
with the proportion of the dataset maliciously obtained and that it has an
inverse relationship with the equivalence class size. Our recursive approach
extends the applicability domain to the general case of a multi-patient
re-identification attack in an arbitrary k-anonymisation scheme. Conclusion: We
prescribe a systematic way to parametrize the k-anonymisation process based on
a pre-determined re-identification probability. We observed that the benefits
of a reduced re-identification risk that come with increasing k-size may not be
worth the reduction in data granularity when one is considering benchmarking
the re-identification probability on the size of the portion of the dataset

scoring are used to describe all possible prosodic structure trees, of which
each tree has its corresponding score. To find the optimal tree with the
highest score for a given sentence, a bottom-up CKY-style algorithm is further
used. The proposed method can predict prosodic labels of different levels at
the same time and accomplish the process directly from Chinese characters in an

comparing them with polarised cross-identified NVSS sources. Average RMs of the
individual fields lie within the error of the best Milky Way foreground

several end-to-end methods have been proposed. However, such models are harder
to train and require a large number of high-quality recordings with

high-level linguistic features, they are more robust to noise. That allows us
to utilize annotated speech datasets of a lower quality to train the

on large-scale untranscribed audio corpora, as Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings are
already time-aligned. This results in an increased generalization capability to

paper makes the first attempt to conduct a comprehensive study on the
robustness of deep learning-based rain removal methods against adversarial

removal methods are more vulnerable to the adversarial attacks as small
distortions/perturbations become less noticeable or detectable. In this paper,
we first present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of various methods at
different levels of attacks and with various losses/targets to generate the
perturbations from the perspective of human perception and machine analysis

only in the rain regions to make the perturbations in the attacked rain images
less visible; 2) object-sensitive attacks, adding perturbations only in regions

critical for the removal of accumulated navigation error caused by the drift
and bias inherent in inertial sensors. One way to perform such an aiding uses
matching of geophysical measurements, such as gravimetry, gravity gradiometry
or magnetometry, with a known geo-referenced map. Although simple in concept,
this map matching procedure is challenging: the measurements themselves are
noisy; their associated spatial location is uncertain; and the measurements may
match multiple points within the map (i.e. non-unique solution). In this paper,
we propose a probabilistic multiple hypotheses tracker to solve the map
matching problem and allow robust inertial navigation aiding. Our approach
addresses the problem both locally, via probabilistic data association, and
temporally by incorporating the underlying platform kinematic constraints into
the tracker. The map matching output is then integrated into the navigation
system using an unscented Kalman filter. Additionally, we present a statistical
measure of local map information density -- the map feature variability -- and
use it to weight the output covariance of the proposed algorithm. The
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated using a
navigation scenario involving gravitational map matching.

increase accuracy of RANS equations. The divergence of the Reynolds Stress
Tensor (RST) is obtained through a Neural Network (NN) whose architecture and
input choice guarantee both Galilean and coordinates-frame rotation. The former
derives from the input choice of the NN while the latter from the expansion of
the divergence of the RST into a vector basis. This approach has been widely
used for data-driven models for the anisotropic RST or the RST discrepancies
and it is here proposed for the divergence of the RST. Hence, a constitutive
relation of the divergence of the RST from mean quantities is proposed to
obtain such expansion. Moreover, once the proposed data-driven approach is
trained, there is no need to run any classic turbulence model to close the
equations. The well-known tests of flow in a square duct and over periodic
hills are used to show advantages of the present method compared to standard
turbulence models.

In our scenario, the database consists of gnomonic views generated from

a standard field-of-view camera at a different time. To improve localization,
we check the semantic similarity between query and database images, which is
not trivial since the position and viewpoint of the cameras do not exactly
match. To learn similarity, we propose training a CNN in a self-supervised

used the semantic similarity scores to verify the retrievals obtained by a

in the atmospheric sciences, e.g., for the determination of spatiotemporal
correlations in wind parks, the estimation of individual loads on turbine rotor
and blades, or for the modeling of particle-turbulence interaction in
atmospheric clouds or pollutant distributions in urban settings. Due to the
prohibitive task of resolving the fields across a broad range of scales, one
oftentimes has to resort to stochastic wind field models that fulfill specific,
empirically observed, properties. Here, we present a new model for the
generation of synthetic wind fields that can be apprehended as an extension of
the well-known Mann model for inflow turbulence in the wind energy sciences.
Whereas such Gaussian random field models solely control second-order
statistics (i.e., velocity correlation tensors or kinetic energy spectra), we
explicitly show that our extended model emulates the effects of higher-order
statistics as well. Most importantly, the empirically observed phenomenon of
small-scale intermittency, which can be regarded as one of the key features of
atmospheric turbulent flows, is reproduced with high accuracy and at
considerably low computational cost. Our method is based on a recently
developed multipoint statistical description of turbulent velocity fields [J.
Friedrich et al., J. Phys. Complex. 2 045006 (2021)] and consists of a
superposition of multivariate Gaussian statistics with fluctuating covariances.

constrained on a certain number of point-wise measurement data from a

For two pulsars, PSRs~J1857+0943 and J1939+2134, we were able to obtain

measurement noises, the LS estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically
normal. However, the LS problem is nonsmooth and nonconvex, and therefore hard
to solve. We then devise realizable estimators that possess the same asymptotic
properties as the LS one. These estimators are based on a two-step estimation
architecture, which says that any $\sqrt{m}$-consistent estimate followed by a
one-step Gauss-Newton iteration can yield a solution that possesses the same
asymptotic property as the LS one. The keypoint of the two-step scheme is to
construct a $\sqrt{m}$-consistent estimate in the first step. In terms of
whether the variance of measurement noises is known or not, we propose the
Bias-Eli estimator (which involves solving a generalized trust region
subproblem) and the Noise-Est estimator (which is obtained by solving a convex
problem), respectively. Both of them are proved to be $\sqrt{m}$-consistent.
Moreover, we show that by discarding the constraints in the above two
optimization problems, the resulting closed-form estimators (called
Bias-Eli-Lin and Noise-Est-Lin) are also $\sqrt{m}$-consistent. Plenty of
simulations verify the correctness of our theoretical claims, showing that the
proposed two-step estimators can asymptotically achieve the Cramer-Rao lower
bound.

to its promising performance when compared to convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). As a result, many researchers have tried to incorporate ViT models in
hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, but without achieving
satisfactory performance. To this paper, we introduce a new multimodal fusion
transformer (MFT) network for HSI land-cover classification, which utilizes
other sources of multimodal data in addition to HSI. Instead of using
conventional feature fusion techniques, other multimodal data are used as an
external classification (CLS) token in the transformer encoder, which helps
achieving better generalization. ViT and other similar transformer models use a
randomly initialized external classification token {and fail to generalize
well}. However, the use of a feature embedding derived from other sources of
multimodal data, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), offers the
potential to improve those models by means of a CLS. The concept of
tokenization is used in our work to generate CLS and HSI patch tokens, helping
to learn key features in a reduced feature space. We also introduce a new
attention mechanism for improving the exchange of information between HSI
tokens and the CLS (e.g., LiDAR) token. Extensive experiments are carried out
on widely used and benchmark datasets i.e., the University of Houston, Trento,
University of Southern Mississippi Gulfpark (MUUFL), and Augsburg. In the
results section, we compare the proposed MFT model with other state-of-the-art
transformer models, classical CNN models, as well as conventional classifiers.
The superior performance achieved by the proposed model is due to the use of
multimodal information as external classification tokens.

far, only a mean-field description of this process exists. This paper goes
beyond by working out a quantum mechanical description of the effective
thermo-optic photon-photon interaction. To this end, the self-consistent
modelling of the temperature diffusion builds the backbone of the modelling.

caustic-crossing microlensing event found from a blind search of data gathered
from Campaign 9 of the Kepler K2 mission (K2C9). K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb is the
first bound microlensing exoplanet discovered from space-based data. The event
has caustic entry and exit points that are resolved in the K2C9 data, enabling
the lens--source relative proper motion to be measured. We have fitted a binary
microlens model to the Kepler data, and to simultaneous observations from
multiple ground-based surveys. Whilst the ground-based data only sparsely
sample the binary caustic, they provide a clear detection of parallax that
allows us to break completely the microlensing mass--position--velocity
degeneracy and measure the planet's mass directly. We find a host mass of
$0.58\pm0.04 ~{\rm M}_\odot$ and a planetary mass of $1.1\pm0.1 ~{\rm M_J}$.
The system lies at a distance of $5.2\pm0.2~$kpc from Earth towards the
Galactic bulge, more than twice the distance of the previous most distant
planet found by Kepler. The sky-projected separation of the planet from its
host is found to be $4.2\pm0.3~$au which, for circular orbits, deprojects to a
host separation $a = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-0.4}~$au and orbital period $P =
13^{+9}_{-2}~$yr. This makes K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb a close Jupiter analogue
orbiting a low-mass host star. According to current planet formation models,
this system is very close to the host mass threshold below which Jupiters are
not expected to form. Upcoming space-based exoplanet microlensing surveys by
NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and, possibly, ESA's Euclid mission,
will provide demanding tests of current planet formation models.

  Flocking (Extended Version)",,,,,"cs.MA cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We introduce the novel concept of Spatial Predictive Control (SPC) to solve
the following problem: given a collection of agents (e.g., drones) with
positional low-level controllers (LLCs) and a mission-specific distributed cost
function, how can a distributed controller achieve and maintain cost-function
minimization without a plant model and only positional observations of the
environment? Our fully distributed SPC controller is based strictly on the
position of the agent itself and on those of its neighboring agents. This
information is used in every time-step to compute the gradient of the cost
function and to perform a spatial look-ahead to predict the best next target
position for the LLC. Using a high-fidelity simulation environment, we show
that SPC outperforms the most closely related class of controllers, Potential
Field Controllers, on the drone flocking problem. We also show that SPC is able
to cope with a potential sim-to-real transfer gap by demonstrating its
performance on real hardware, namely our implementation of flocking using nine
Crazyflie 2.1 drones.

signals that are produced in the plastic due to muon trajectories are absorbed
by wavelength shifting (WLS) fibres. The WLS fibres re-emit photons of longer
wavelengths and propagate those to silicon photo-multipliers (SiPMs). The SiPMs
detect these photons, producing electronic signals. The CMV detector will use
more than 700 scintillators to cover the mini-ICAL detector and will require
around 3000 SiPMs. The design goal for the cosmic muon veto efficiency of the

characterised to satisfy the design goal of CMV. A mass testing system was
developed for the measurement of gain and choice of the overvoltage ($V_{ov}$)

transportation systems (ITS) technology has enormous potential for improving
efficiency and safety of road transportation. Recent advances in V2X
communication primarily address the definition of V2X messages and data
dissemination amongst ITS stations (ITS-Ss) in a traffic environment. Yet, a
largely unsolved problem is how a connected vehicle (CV) can efficiently and
consistently fuse its local perception information with the data received from
other ITS-Ss. In this paper, we present a novel data fusion framework to fuse
the local and V2X perception data for CP that considers the presence of
cross-correlation. The proposed approach is validated through comprehensive
results obtained from numerical simulation, CARLA simulation, and real-world
experimentation that incorporates V2X-enabled intelligent platforms. The
real-world experiment includes a CV, a connected and automated vehicle (CAV),
and an intelligent roadside unit (IRSU) retrofitted with vision and lidar
sensors. We also demonstrate how the fused CP information can improve the
awareness of vulnerable road users (VRU) for CV/CAV, and how this information
can be considered in path planning/decision making within the CAV to facilitate
safe interactions.

propose PADA (Pruning Assisted Domain Adaptation) and zero out redundant
weights from models pre-trained on large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data.
Intuitively, this helps to make space for the target-domain ASR finetuning. The
redundant weights can be identified through various pruning strategies which

investigate the effect of the recently discovered Task-Agnostic and Task-Aware
pruning on PADA and propose a new pruning paradigm based on the latter, which
we call Cross-Domain Task-Aware Pruning (CD-TAW). CD-TAW obtains the initial
pruning mask from a well fine-tuned OOD model, which makes it starkly different
from the rest of the pruning strategies discussed in the paper. Our proposed
CD-TAW methodology achieves up to 20.6% relative WER improvement over our

understanding of human activities and is widely used in video processing, video
surveillance, and human modeling in virtual reality. Most current VIS methods
are based on Mask-RCNN framework, where the target appearance and motion
information for data matching will increase computational cost and have an
impact on segmentation real-time performance; on the other hand, the existing
datasets for VIS focus less on all the people appearing in the video. In this
paper, to solve the problems, we develop a new method for human video instance
segmentation based on single-stage detector. To tracking the instance across
the video, we have adopted data association strategy for matching the same
instance in the video sequence, where we jointly learn target instance
appearances and their affinities in a pair of video frames in an end-to-end
fashion. We have also adopted the centroid sampling strategy for enhancing the
embedding extraction ability of instance, which is to bias the instance
position to the inside of each instance mask with heavy overlap condition. As a
result, even there exists a sudden change in the character activity, the
instance position will not move out of the mask, so that the problem that the
same instance is represented by two different instances can be alleviated.
Finally, we collect PVIS dataset by assembling several video instance
segmentation datasets to fill the gap of the current lack of datasets dedicated
to human video segmentation. Extensive simulations based on such dataset has
been conduct. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed work.

  (2)A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose entries

Whereas algebraic dynamic data structures supporting edge updates and

  In this paper we develop the first known fully dynamic reachability data
structures working against an adaptive adversary and supporting edge updates
and path queries for two natural variants: (1) point-to-point path reporting,
and (2) single-source reachability tree reporting. For point-to-point queries
in DAGs, we achieve $O(n^{1.529})$ worst-case update and query bounds, whereas
for tree reporting in DAGs, the worst-case bounds are $O(n^{1.765})$. More
importantly, we show how to lift these algorithms to work on general graphs at
the cost of increasing the bounds to $n^{1+5/6+o(1)}$ and making the update
times amortized. On the way to accomplishing that, we obtain two interesting
subresults. We give subquadratic fully dynamic algorithms for topological order
(in a DAG), and strongly connected components. To the best of our knowledge,
such algorithms have not been described before.
  Additionally, we provide deterministic incremental data structures for
reachability and shortest paths that handle edge insertions and report the
respective paths within subquadratic worst-case time bounds. For reachability
and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths in weighted digraphs, these
bounds match the best known dynamic matrix inverse-based randomized bounds for
fully dynamic reachability [v.d.Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak, FOCS'19]. For
exact shortest paths in unweighted graphs, the obtained bounds in the
incremental setting polynomially improve upon the respective best known
randomized update/distance query bounds in the fully dynamic setting.

for measuring hand use in the home among individuals living with tetraplegia.
Methods: Several deep learning algorithms for detecting functional hand-object
interactions were developed and compared. The most accurate algorithm was used
to extract measures of hand function from 65 hours of unscripted video recorded
at home by 20 participants with tetraplegia. These measures were: the
percentage of interaction time over total recording time (Perc); the average
duration of individual interactions (Dur); the number of interactions per hour
(Num). To demonstrate the clinical validity of the technology, egocentric
measures were correlated with validated clinical assessments of hand function
and independence (Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and
Prehension - GRASSP, Upper Extremity Motor Score - UEMS, and Spinal Cord
Independent Measure - SCIM). Results: Hand-object interactions were
automatically detected with a median F1-score of 0.80 (0.67-0.87). Our results
demonstrated that higher UEMS and better prehension were related to greater
time spent interacting, whereas higher SCIM and better hand sensation resulted
in a higher number of interactions performed during the egocentric video
recordings. Conclusions: For the first time, measures of hand function
automatically estimated in an unconstrained environment in individuals with
tetraplegia have been validated against internationally accepted measures of
hand function. Future work will necessitate a formal evaluation of the
reliability and responsiveness of the egocentric-based performance measures for

measures the time-integrated strength of the potential. Compared to the best
previous results, this exponentially improves the dependence on $\epsilon$ and
$g'$ from $\text{poly}(g'/\epsilon)$ to $\text{poly}(\log(g'/\epsilon))$ and
polynomially improves the dependence on $T$ and $d$, while maintaining best

  Teacher","selected for an oral presentation at CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Model quantization is considered as a promising method to greatly reduce the
resource requirements of deep neural networks. To deal with the performance
drop induced by quantization errors, a popular method is to use training data
to fine-tune quantized networks. In real-world environments, however, such a
method is frequently infeasible because training data is unavailable due to
security, privacy, or confidentiality concerns. Zero-shot quantization
addresses such problems, usually by taking information from the weights of a
full-precision teacher network to compensate the performance drop of the
quantized networks. In this paper, we first analyze the loss surface of
state-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques and provide several
findings. In contrast to usual knowledge distillation problems, zero-shot
quantization often suffers from 1) the difficulty of optimizing multiple loss
terms together, and 2) the poor generalization capability due to the use of
synthetic samples. Furthermore, we observe that many weights fail to cross the
rounding threshold during training the quantized networks even when it is
necessary to do so for better performance. Based on the observations, we
propose AIT, a simple yet powerful technique for zero-shot quantization, which
addresses the aforementioned two problems in the following way: AIT i) uses a
KL distance loss only without a cross-entropy loss, and ii) manipulates
gradients to guarantee that a certain portion of weights are properly updated
after crossing the rounding thresholds. Experiments show that AIT outperforms
the performance of many existing methods by a great margin, taking over the
overall state-of-the-art position in the field.

the 3D variation of the full lattice strain tensor within the microcrystal can
be recovered. However, this requires knowledge of the crystal orientation,
which is typically attained via estimates based on crystal geometry or
synchrotron micro-beam Laue diffraction measurements. Here, we present an
alternative method to determine the crystal orientation for BCDI measurements,
by using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to align Fe-Ni and Co-Fe alloy
microcrystals on three different substrates. The orientation matrix is
calculated from EBSD Euler angles and compared to the orientation determined
using micro-beam Laue diffraction. The average angular mismatch between the
orientation matrices is less than ~6 degrees, which is reasonable for the
search for Bragg reflections. We demonstrate the use of an orientation matrix
derived from EBSD to align and measure five reflections for a single Fe-Ni
microcrystal using multi-reflection BCDI. Using this dataset, a refined strain
field computation based on the gradient of the complex exponential of the phase
is developed. This approach is shown to increase accuracy, especially in the

irregular glottal opening and low pitch. It occurs in diverse languages and is
prevalent in American English, where it is used not only to mark phrase

periodicity, creaky voice challenges automatic speech processing and
recognition systems, particularly for languages where creak is frequently used.
  This paper proposes a deep learning model to detect creaky voice in fluent
speech. The model is composed of an encoder and a classifier trained together.
The encoder takes the raw waveform and learns a representation using a
convolutional neural network. The classifier is implemented as a multi-headed
fully-connected network trained to detect creaky voice, voicing, and pitch,
where the last two are used to refine creak prediction. The model is trained
and tested on speech of American English speakers, annotated for creak by
trained phoneticians.
  We evaluated the performance of our system using two encoders: one is
tailored for the task, and the other is based on a state-of-the-art

improved recall and F1 scores compared to previous methods on unseen data.

technique to self-calibrate the classified logits of detectors in a similar way
to batch normalization. In general, our LogN is training- and tuning-free (i.e.
require no extra training and tuning process), model- and label
distribution-agnostic (i.e. generalization to different kinds of detectors and
datasets), and also plug-and-play (i.e. direct application without any bells

performance of LogN to state-of-the-art methods with various detectors and
backbones. We also provide in-depth studies on different aspects of our LogN.
Further experiments on ImageNet-LT reveal its competitiveness and
generalizability. Our LogN can serve as a strong baseline for long-tail object
detection and is expected to inspire future research in this field. Code and

further processing steps. Recent systematic comparisons of existing algorithms
show that out-of-the-box accuracy is often low and that application-specific

extensively evaluate a quaternion-based orientation estimation algorithm that

all literature methods and achieves an average RMSE of 2.9{\deg}, while the
errors obtained with literature methods range from 5.3{\deg} to 16.7{\deg}.
Since the evaluation was performed with one single fixed parametrization across
a very diverse dataset collection, we conclude that the proposed method
provides unprecedented out-of-the-box performance for a broad range of motions,

the conventional spin Hall effect (SHE), being a time-reversal even effect, the
magnetic counterpart is time-reversal odd. In this work, we use ab initio
calculations to investigate the MSHE for the bulk ferromagnets Fe, Co, and Ni.
The magnitudes of the MSHE of Fe and Co are comparable to those of the SHE, but
the MSHE is strongly dependent on the electron lifetime and the MSHE and SHE
can moreover have opposite signs. For Ni the MSHE is smaller than the SHE, but
in general, the MSHE cannot be ignored for spin-orbit torques. Considering a
charge current we analyze how both the MSHE and SHE contribute to a total Hall
angle. We extend our analysis of the MSHE to its orbital counterpart, that is,
the magnetic orbital Hall effect (MOHE), for which we show that the MOHE is in
general smaller than the orbital Hall effect (OHE). We compute furthermore the

spaxels. Using a combination of phenomenological modelling and partial
correlation analysis, we find that $\mathrm{\Sigma_{*}}$ alone is insufficient
to predict the N/O in MaNGA spaxels, and that there is an additional dependence
on the local star formation rate surface density, $\mathrm{\Sigma_{SFR}}$. This
effect is a factor of $3$ stronger than the dependence of 12+log(O/H) on
$\mathrm{\Sigma_{SFR}}$. Surprisingly, we find that the local N/O scaling
relations also depend on the total galaxy stellar mass at fixed $\Sigma_{*}$ as
well as the galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. We find that more compact
galaxies are more nitrogen rich, even when $\mathrm{\Sigma_{*}}$ and
$\mathrm{\Sigma_{SFR}}$ are controlled for. We show that $\sim50\%$ of the
variance of N/O is explained by the total stellar mass and size. Thus, the
evolution of nitrogen in galaxies is set by more than just local effects and
does not simply track the build up of oxygen in galaxies. The precise form of
the N/O-O/H relation is therefore sensitive to the sample of galaxies from
which it is derived. This result casts doubt on the universal applicability of
nitrogen-based strong-line metallicity indicators derived in the local

via the joint design of transmit power, artificial noise, and phase shifts at

a mean metallicity $\rm -2.13\,dex$ which may be a new substructure. As for
GES, we find that it accounts for a large part of substructures in the inner

increase oscillation amplitudes, we made time-distance maps to identify the
oscillatory signals. We also estimated the loop lengths and velocity
amplitudes. We analysed 23 CBPs, and found 31 oscillation events in 16 of them.
The oscillation periods range from 1 to 8 minutes (on average about 5 minutes),
and the displacement amplitudes have an average value of 0.07 Mm. The average

cross-domain spoken language identification (SLID) system, as an unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) method, we have proposed a joint distribution alignment
(JDA) model based on optimal transport (OT). A discrepancy measurement based on
OT was adopted for JDA between training and test data sets. In our previous
study, it was supposed that the training and test sets share the same label
space. However, in real applications, the label space of the test set is only a
subset of that of the training set. Fully matching training and test domains
for distribution alignment may introduce negative domain transfer. In this
paper, we propose an JDA model based on partial optimal transport (POT), i.e.,
only partial couplings of OT are allowed during JDA. Moreover, since the label
of test data is unknown, in the POT, a soft weighting on the coupling based on
transport cost is adaptively set during domain alignment. Experiments were
carried out on a cross-domain SLID task to evaluate the proposed UDA. Results
showed that our proposed UDA significantly improved the performance due to the
consideration of the partial couplings in OT.

field of spin-orbitronics. In this work, using relativistic density functional
theory and the Kubo linear-response formalism, we systematically investigate
the spin Hall and orbital Hall effects for 40 monoatomic metals. The spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) and orbital Hall conductivity (OHC) are computed as a
function of the electrochemical potential and the influence of the spin-orbit
interaction strength is also investigated. Our calculations predict a rather
small OHC in $sp$ metals, but a much larger OHC in $d$-band metals, with
maximum values [$\sim 8000\,(\hbar/e)\Omega^{-1}{\rm cm}^{-1}$] near the middle
of the $d$ series. Using the Mott formula, we evaluate the thermal counterparts
of the spin and orbital Hall effects, the spin Nernst effect (SNE) and the
orbital Nernst effect (ONE). We find that the as-yet unobserved ONE is
significantly larger ($\sim 10 \times$) than the SNE and has maximum values for
group 10 elements (Ni, Pd, and Pt). Our work provides a broad overview of
electrically- and thermally-induced spin and orbital transport in monoatomic

semimetals, having different energies and opposite conserved charges. The

electron's bands associated with the inter-band excitations. The opposite
charges foster fertile scattering processes among the inter-band collective

  Forensics and Security",,"10.1109/TIFS.2022.3163592",,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the increasing adoption of data-hungry machine learning algorithms,
personal data privacy has emerged as one of the key concerns that could hinder
the success of digital transformation. As such, Privacy-Preserving Machine
Learning (PPML) has received much attention from both academia and industry.
However, organizations are faced with the dilemma that, on the one hand, they
are encouraged to share data to enhance ML performance, but on the other hand,
they could potentially be breaching the relevant data privacy regulations.
Practical PPML typically allows multiple participants to individually train
their ML models, which are then aggregated to construct a global model in a
privacy-preserving manner, e.g., based on multi-party computation or
homomorphic encryption. Nevertheless, in most important applications of
large-scale PPML, e.g., by aggregating clients' gradients to update a global
model for federated learning, such as consumer behavior modeling of mobile
application services, some participants are inevitably resource-constrained
mobile devices, which may drop out of the PPML system due to their mobility
nature. Therefore, the resilience of privacy-preserving aggregation has become
an important problem to be tackled. In this paper, we propose a scalable
privacy-preserving aggregation scheme that can tolerate dropout by participants
at any time, and is secure against both semi-honest and active malicious
adversaries by setting proper system parameters. By replacing
communication-intensive building blocks with a seed homomorphic pseudo-random
generator, and relying on the additive homomorphic property of Shamir secret
sharing scheme, our scheme outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by up to
6.37$\times$ in runtime and provides a stronger dropout-resilience. The
simplicity of our scheme makes it attractive both for implementation and for
further improvements.

The key idea is to reformulate the WDRC problem as a novel minimax control
problem with an approximate Wasserstein penalty. We derive a closed-form
expression of the optimal control policy of the approximate problem using a
nontrivial Riccati equation. We further show the guaranteed cost property of
the resulting controller and identify a provable bound for the optimality gap.
Finally, we evaluate the performance of our method through numerical
experiments using both Gaussian and non-Gaussian disturbances.

dynamical scaling behavior ranging from standard diffusion to %and
superdiffusion to ballistic and hyperballistic spreading. In this work, we
study the influence of the statistics of the step size and the delocalization
of the initial states on the entanglement entropy of the coin. Our results show
that the gEQW generates maximally entangled states for almost all initial coin
states and coin operators considering initially localized walkers and for the
delocalized ones, taking the proper limit, the same condition is guaranteed.
Differently from all the previous protocols that produce highly entangled
states via QWs, this model is not upper-bounded by ballistic spreading and
hence opens novel prospects for applications of dynamically disordered QWs as a
robust maximal entanglement generator in programmable setups that ranges from
slower-than-ballistic to faster-than ballistic.

of free energies of solvation using experimental data, and reaching competitive
prediction errors (MAE $\sim$ 0.8 kcal/mol) for out-of-sample molecules --
within milli-seconds. As such, AIML effectively bypasses the need for MD or
MC-based phase space sampling, enabling exploration campaigns throughout CCS at
a much accelerated pace. We contextualize our findings by comparison to
state-of-the-art methods resulting in a Pareto plot for the free energy of
solvation predictions in terms of accuracy and time.

spatial and calorimetric resolutions on the charged particles traversing liquid
argon. As a result, the technology has been used in a number of recent neutrino
experiments, and is the technology of choice for the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE). In order to perform high precision measurements of neutrinos
in the detector, final state particles need to be effectively identified, and
their energy accurately reconstructed. This article proposes an algorithm based
on a convolutional neural network to perform the classification of energy
deposits and reconstructed particles as track-like or arising from
electromagnetic cascades. Results from testing the algorithm on data from
ProtoDUNE-SP, a prototype of the DUNE far detector, are presented. The network
identifies track- and shower-like particles, as well as Michel electrons, with
high efficiency. The performance of the algorithm is consistent between data
and simulation.

the existing vision-based multi-camera 3D object detection paradigms. For
fundamentally pushing the performance boundary in this area, a novel paradigm
dubbed BEVDet4D is proposed to lift the scalable BEVDet paradigm from the
spatial-only 3D space to the spatial-temporal 4D space. We upgrade the naive
BEVDet framework with a few modifications just for fusing the feature from the
previous frame with the corresponding one in the current frame. In this way,
with negligible additional computing budget, we enable BEVDet4D to access the
temporal cues by querying and comparing the two candidate features. Beyond
this, we simplify the task of velocity prediction by removing the factors of
ego-motion and time in the learning target. As a result, BEVDet4D with robust
generalization performance reduces the velocity error by up to -62.9%. This
makes the vision-based methods, for the first time, become comparable with
those relied on LiDAR or radar in this aspect. On challenge benchmark nuScenes,
we report a new record of 54.5% NDS with the high-performance configuration
dubbed BEVDet4D-Base, which surpasses the previous leading method BEVDet-Base
by +7.3% NDS. The source code is publicly available for further research at

  Networks (IJCNN)",,,"cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are one popular approach to
incorporate a priori knowledge about physical systems into the learning
framework. PINNs are known to be robust for smaller training sets, derive
better generalization problems, and are faster to train. In this paper, we show
that using PINNs in comparison with purely data-driven neural networks is not
only favorable for training performance but allows us to extract significant
information on the quality of the approximated solution. Assuming that the
underlying differential equation for the PINN training is an ordinary
differential equation, we derive a rigorous upper limit on the PINN prediction
error. This bound is applicable even for input data not included in the
training phase and without any prior knowledge about the true solution.
Therefore, our a posteriori error estimation is an essential step to certify
the PINN. We apply our error estimator exemplarily to two academic toy
problems, whereof one falls in the category of model-predictive control and
thereby shows the practical use of the derived results.

\in E(G)$ implies $u_i = u_1$ and $u_ju_k\in E(G)$ implies $u_j=u_{k-1}$. A set
$S$ of vertices of $G$ is {\it weakly toll convex} if for any two non-adjacent
vertices $x,y \in S$ any vertex in a weakly toll walk between $x$ and $y$ is
also in $S$. The {\em weakly toll convexity} is the graph convexity space
defined over weakly toll convex sets. Many studies are devoted to determine if
a graph equipped with a convexity space is a {\em convex geometry}. An
\emph{extreme vertex} is an element $x$ of a convex set $S$ such that the set
$S\backslash\{x\}$ is also convex. A graph convexity space is said to be a
convex geometry if it satisfies the Minkowski-Krein-Milman property, which
states that every convex set is the convex hull of its extreme vertices. It is
known that chordal, Ptolemaic, weakly polarizable, and interval graphs can be
characterized as convex geometries with respect to the monophonic, geodesic,
$m^3$, and toll convexities, respectively. Other important classes of graphs
can also be characterized in this way. In this paper, we prove that a graph is
a convex geometry with respect to the weakly toll convexity if and only if it
is a proper interval graph. Furthermore, some well-known graph invariants are
studied with respect to the weakly toll convexity.

tree-level flat space S-matrices with external massless scalars and another
scaling exponent $A'$ in the Regge limit of the corresponding four-point scalar
conformal correlators by using scaling exponents of Mellin amplitudes. We
derive $A'\ge A$, which leads to the Regge growth bound of tree-level flat

correspondence, from polynomial boundedness of the Mellin amplitudes for local
bulk descriptions. We also show $A'=A$ from the conformal block expansion in

mass rocky planets between an atmosphere-less projectile and an atmosphere-rich
target. In this work we present results from head-on to grazing collisions. The
results of the simulations fall into two broad categories: 1) one main
post-collision remnant containing material from target and projectile; 2) two
main post-collision remnants resulting from `erosive hit-and-run' collisions.
All collisions removed at least some of the target atmosphere, in contrast to
the idealised hit-and-run definition in which the target mass is unchanged. We
find that the boundary between `hit-and-run' collisions and collisions that
result in the projectile and target accreting/merging to be strongly correlated
with the mutual escape velocity at the predicted point of closest approach. Our
work shows that it is very unlikely for a single giant impact to remove all of
the atmosphere. For all the atmosphere to be removed, head-on impacts require
roughly the energy of catastrophic disruption (i.e. permanent ejection of half
the total system mass) and result in significant erosion of the mantle. We show
that higher impact angle collisions, which are more common, are less efficient
at atmosphere removal than head-on collisions. Therefore, single collisions
that remove all the atmosphere without substantially disrupting the planet are
not expected during planet formation.

in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective
optimisation.

the Mittag-Leffler expansion, a pole expansion, of the three-channel scattering
amplitude includes not only topologically trivial but also nontrivial
contributions and is given by the Weierstrass zeta function. Finally, we
examine the obtained formula in the context of a simple three-channel model.
Taking a simple non-relativistic effective field theory with contact
interaction for the $S=-2$, $I=0$, $J^P = 0^+$,
$\Lambda\Lambda-N\Xi-\Sigma\Sigma$ coupled-channel scattering, we demonstrate
that the scattering amplitude as a function of the uniformization variable is,

have the potential to overcome this hurdle but, so far, the effect of
multiphoton emission on the quality of entanglement has never been addressed in
detail. Here, we tackle this challenge using photon pairs from a
resonantly-driven quantum dot and comparing quantum state tomography and
second-order coherence measurements as a function of the excitation power. We
observe that the relative (absolute) multiphoton emission probability is as low
as $p_m= (5.6 \pm 0.6)10^{-4}$ ($p_2= (1.5 \pm 0.3)10^{-6}$) at the maximum
source brightness, values that lead to a negligible effect on the degree of
entanglement. In stark contrast with probabilistic sources of entangled
photons, we also demonstrate that the multiphoton emission probability and the
degree of entanglement remain practically unchanged against the excitation
power for multiple Rabi cycles, despite we clearly observe oscillations in the
second-order coherence measurements. Our results, explained by a theoretical
model that we develop to estimate the actual multiphoton contribution in the
two-photon density matrix, highlight that quantum dots can be regarded as a
multipair-free source of entangled photons in the solid state.

cohesion, but its duration becomes shorter. Defining a narrow displacement
interval, a well-defined shear band revealing the failure comes out. Solving
the equilibrium of the failing block, we are able to make successful
predictions for the dependance between failure angle and cohesion, thereby
disclosing two distinct frictional behaviour: while friction remains constant

complicated diagnostic process. However, early diagnosis is vital to control
symptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and
interpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia
diagnosis from brain-imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large
training-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real
world. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on
readily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of
patients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in
all mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method
could be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist
clinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate
real-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust.
Understanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to
allow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse
two complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and
'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute
interactivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make
decisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached,
improving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to
generalise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with
augmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We
find that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore
perform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98% accuracy with 10-fold
cross-validation.

inversion process is known to be highly unstable and it has been necessary to
provide additional constraints, such as requiring that the DEM should be
smooth. However, this is a non-physical constraint. The goal of this analysis
is to make an empirical determination of the ability of a set of emission line
intensities to constrain the reconstruction. Here, a simple model is used, by
means of a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain process, to arrive at solutions that
reproduces the observed intensities in a region of the quiet Sun and a solar
active region. These solutions are compared by means of the reduced
chi-squared. The conclusion from this analysis is that the observations are
only capable of constraining model consisting of 4 temperature-emission measure
pairs plus a determination of the standard deviation of the model from the
observed line intensities. A more complex model with 5 temperature-emission
measure pairs does not improve the fit and leads to parameters that are
irrelevant. A more general conclusion is that the information content of a set

interaction of nodal and apsidal precession of the accretion disc with orbital
motion. For the other two sources, V902 Mon and SWIFT J0746.3-1608, we have

$\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) and the Riemann
hypothesis. It is known that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to an
inequality for the sum of divisors function $\sigma (n)$. Based on previous
results in literature, we focus on the fact that $\sigma (n)$ appears in a
problem of counting supersymmetric states in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with
$SU(3)$ gauge group: the Schur limit of the superconformal index plays a role
of a generating function of $\sigma (n)$. Then assuming the Riemann hypothesis
gives bounds on information on the $1/8$-BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.
The AdS/CFT correspondence further connects the Riemann hypothesis to the type
IIB superstring theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5$. In particular, the Riemann
hypothesis implies a miraculous cancellation among Kaluza-Klein modes of the
supergravity multiplet and D3-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles in the
string theory. We also discuss possibilities to gain new insights on the
Riemann hypothesis from the physics side.

at the critical composition ($50\%$ volume fraction) in which the mobilities of
the two phases differ by a factor of 100. This system is simulated in two and
three dimensions using the Cahn-Hilliard model with a concentration-dependent

morphological transition occurs during coarsening of the two-dimensional system
(corresponding to a thin film geometry) with dissimilar mobilities, resulting
in a system of nearly-circular particles of high-mobility phase embedded in a
low-mobility matrix. This morphological transition causes the coarsening rate
constant to decrease over time, which explains why a previous study found lack
of agreement with the theoretical $t^{1/3}$ power law. Three-dimensional
systems with dissimilar mobilities resulted in bicontinuous microstructures
that evolve self-similarly, as determined by quantitative analysis of the

bad wolf was assigned by the journal to assess the merit of these manuscripts.
The pigs proposed three distinct construction frameworks, which varied in
physical and mathematical sophistication. The first little pig submitted a
model of straw, based on the numerical method of toe-counting. His design
included odd features, such as spilled millet and cloven-hoofprints on the
window sill -- possibly a ploy to distract the wolf from the manuscript's
facile mathematical foundation. The second little pig used a more advanced
approach, employing Newton's classical laws of motion, to propose a house of
sticks. This pig included in her manuscript copious citations by a specific
wolf, possibly aiming to ensure acceptance by flattering the wolf whom she
anticipated would be the referee. The third little pig described an
ostentatious house of bricks based on an elaborate dynamical systems and
stability analysis, possibly scheming to dazzle and impress. The big bad wolf

straw: the minor revision of water-proofing; for sticks: the major revision of
fire-proofing, given concerns surrounding climate change; for bricks:
unequivocal rejection, accompanied by multiple derogatory comments regarding

attackers against privacy in the context of supervisory control of
discrete-event systems (DES). We consider a DES plant controlled by a
supervisor, which is subject to sensor deception attacks. Specifically, we
consider an active attacker that can tamper with the observations received by
the supervisor by, e.g., hacking on the communication channel between the
sensors and the supervisor. The privacy requirement of the supervisory control
system is to maintain initial-state opacity, i.e., it does not want to reveal
the fact that it was initiated from a secret state during its operation. On the
other hand, the attacker aims to deceive the supervisor, by tampering with its
observations, such that initial-state opacity is violated due to incorrect
control actions. In this work, we investigate from the attacker's point of view
by presenting an effective approach for synthesizing sensor attack strategies
threatening the privacy of the system. To this end, we propose the All Attack
Structure (AAS) that records state estimates for both the supervisor and the
attacker. This structure serves as a basis for synthesizing a sensor attack
strategy. We also discuss how to simplify the synthesis complexity by
leveraging the structural property of the initial-state privacy requirement. A
running academic example is provided to illustrate the synthesis procedure.

ages, we find an average decrease of 0.60 years of schooling by 2011, when
children's mean age was 17 years old. Negative effects strengthen with time
since closure. For boys, there is no corresponding significant effect.
Different effects by gender may be related to greater sensitivity of girls'
enrollment to distance and greater responsiveness of boys' enrollment to

the role of these singularities (Dirac point, van Hove singularity, or the flat

Nevertheless some behaviors are generic, e.g. dependence of the critical
magnetic coupling on the DOS at the Fermi level. However, the Shiba states
realized in the Lieb lattice exhibit extraordinary properties, which can be
explained by the presence of a few nonequivalent sublattices. Depending on the
location of the magnetic impurity in the chosen sublattice, the value of
critical magnetic coupling $J_\text{c}$ can be reduced or enhanced when the

important, given the high prevalence of AD and the high cost of traditional

speech processing and machine learning (ML) provide promising techniques for
reliably detecting AD. However, speech audio may be affected by different types
of background noise and it is important to understand how the noise influences
the accuracy of ML models detecting AD from speech. In this paper, we study the
effect of fifteen types of environmental noise from five different categories
on the performance of four ML models trained with three types of acoustic
representations. We perform a thorough analysis showing how ML models and
acoustic features are affected by different types of acoustic noise. We show
that acoustic noise is not necessarily harmful - certain types of noise are
beneficial for AD detection models and help increasing accuracy by up to 4.8\%.
We provide recommendations on how to utilize acoustic noise in order to achieve
the best performance results with the ML models deployed in real world.

an offline clustering model. One is to predict the pseudo codes via masked
language modeling in encoder output, like HuBERT model, while the other lets
the decoder learn to reconstruct pseudo codes autoregressively instead of
generating textual scripts. In this way, the decoder learns to reconstruct
original speech information with codes before learning to generate correct
text. Comprehensive experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the
proposed Speech2C can relatively reduce the word error rate (WER) by 19.2% over
the method without decoder pre-training, and also outperforms significantly the

  Communications Technologies",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advancements in V2X communications have greatly increased the
flexibility of the physical and medium access control (MAC) layers. This
increases the complexity when investigating the system from a network
perspective to evaluate the performance of the supported applications. Such
flexibility needs in fact to be taken into account through a cross-layer
approach, which might lead to challenging evaluation processes. As an accurate
simulation of the signals appears unfeasible, a typical solution is to rely on
simple models for incorporating the physical layer of the supported
technologies, based on off-line measurements or accurate link-level
simulations. Such data is however limited to a subset of possible
configurations and extending them to others is costly when not even impossible.
The goal of this paper is to develop a new approach for modelling the physical
layer of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications that can be extended to a
wide range of configurations without leading to extensive measurement or
simulation campaign at the link layer. In particular, given a scenario and
starting from results in terms of packet error rate (PER) vs.
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related to a subset of possible
configurations, we derive one parameter, called implementation loss, that is
then used to evaluate the network performance under any configuration in the
same scenario. The proposed methodology, leading to a good trade-off among
complexity, generality, and accuracy of the performance evaluation process, has
been validated through extensive simulations with both IEEE 802.11p and LTE-V2X
sidelink technologies in various scenarios.

introduced as the application of the ensemble Kalman filter to inverse
problems. In practice it has been widely used as derivative-free optimization
method in order to estimate unknown parameters from noisy measurement data. For
linear forward models the EKI can be viewed as gradient flow preconditioned by
a certain sample covariance matrix. Through the preconditioning the resulting
scheme remains in a finite dimensional subspace of the original
high-dimensional (or even infinite dimensional) parameter space and can be
viewed as optimizer restricted to this subspace. For general nonlinear forward
models the resulting EKI flow can only be viewed as gradient flow in
approximation. In this paper we discuss the effect of applying a sample
covariance as preconditioning matrix and quantify the gradient flow structure
of the EKI by controlling the approximation error through the spread in the
particle system. The ensemble collapse on the one side leads to an accurate
gradient approximation, but on the other side to degeneration in the
preconditioning sample covariance matrix. In order to ensure convergence as
optimization method we derive lower as well as upper bounds on the ensemble
collapse. Furthermore, we introduce covariance inflation without breaking the
subspace property intending to reduce the collapse rate of the ensemble such
that the convergence rate improves. In a numerical experiment we apply EKI to a
nonlinear elliptic boundary-value problem and illustrate the dependence of EKI
as derivative-free optimizer on the choice of the initial ensemble.

are less likely to be examined - and thus clicked - by users, in spite of their
actual preferences between items. The prevalent approach to unbiased
click-based learning-to-rank (LTR) is based on counterfactual
inverse-propensity-scoring (IPS) estimation. In contrast with general
reinforcement learning, counterfactual doubly-robust (DR) estimation has not
been applied to click-based LTR in previous literature. In this paper, we
introduce a novel DR estimator that is the first DR approach specifically
designed for position-bias. The difficulty with position-bias is that the
treatment - user examination - is not directly observable in click data. As a
solution, our estimator uses the expected treatment per rank, instead of the
actual treatment that existing DR estimators use. Our novel DR estimator has
more robust unbiasedness conditions than the existing IPS approach, and in
addition, provides enormous decreases in variance: our experimental results
indicate it requires several orders of magnitude fewer datapoints to converge
at optimal performance. For the unbiased LTR field, our DR estimator
contributes both increases in state-of-the-art performance and the most robust
theoretical guarantees of all known LTR estimators.

dynamics of interacting, open spin systems. Our approach overcomes some of the
shortcomings of the recently developed discrete truncated Wigner approximation
(DTWA) based on Monte-Carlo sampling in a discrete phase space that improves
the classical treatment by accounting for lowest-order quantum fluctuations. We
provide a rigorous derivation of the DTWA by embedding it in a continuous phase
space, thereby introducing a hybrid discrete-continuous truncated Wigner
approximation (DCTWA). We derive a set of operator-differential mappings that
yield an exact equation of motion (EOM) for the continuous SU(2) Wigner
function of spins. The standard DTWA is then recovered by a systematic
neglection of specific terms in this exact EOM. The hybrid approach permits us
to determine the validity conditions and to gain detailed understanding of the
quality of the approximation, paving the way for systematic improvements.
Furthermore, we show that the continuous embedding allows for a straightforward
extension of the method to open spin systems subject to dephasing, losses and
incoherent drive, while preserving the key advantages of the discrete approach,
such as a positive definite Wigner distribution of typical initial states. We
derive exact stochastic differential equations for processes which cannot be
described by the standard DTWA due to the presence of non-classical noise. We
illustrate our approach by applying it to the dissipative dynamics of Rydberg
excitation of one-dimensional arrays of laser-driven atoms and compare it to
exact results for small systems.

challenge in scientific computing. We develop a new numerical method for
solving elliptic-type PDEs by adapting the Q-learning algorithm in
reinforcement learning. Our ""Q-PDE"" algorithm is mesh-free and therefore has
the potential to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using a neural tangent
kernel (NTK) approach, we prove that the neural network approximator for the
PDE solution, trained with the Q-PDE algorithm, converges to the trajectory of
an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of
hidden units $\rightarrow \infty$. For monotone PDE (i.e. those given by
monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap
in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the
infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the
training time $\rightarrow \infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed
point of the wide-network limit for the Q-PDE algorithm is a solution of the
PDE (not necessarily under the monotone condition). The numerical performance
of the Q-PDE algorithm is studied for several elliptic PDEs.

Nowadays, BERT-based evaluation metrics considerably outperform BLEU. In this

impact of preprocessing, we then conduct a second study where we examine its

have large effects, especially for highly inflectional languages. In this case,
the effect of preprocessing may be larger than the effect of the aggregation
mechanism (e.g., greedy alignment vs. Word Mover Distance).

methods within an active learning framework. Graph-based methods in machine
learning are based on a similarity graph constructed from the data. When the
data consists of raw images composed of scenes, extraneous information can make
the classification task more difficult. In recent years, neural network methods
have been shown to provide a promising framework for extracting patterns from
SAR images. These methods, however, require ample training data to avoid
overfitting. At the same time, such training data are often unavailable for
applications of interest, such as automatic target recognition (ATR) and SAR
data. We use a Convolutional Neural Network Variational Autoencoder (CNNVAE) to
embed SAR data into a feature space, and then construct a similarity graph from
the embedded data and apply graph-based semi-supervised learning techniques.
The CNNVAE feature embedding and graph construction requires no labeled data,
which reduces overfitting and improves the generalization performance of graph
learning at low label rates. Furthermore, the method easily incorporates a
human-in-the-loop for active learning in the data-labeling process. We present
promising results and compare them to other standard machine learning methods

we conduct a fundamental study on how different stochastic data sampling
schemes affect the sample complexity of online stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) over highly dependent data. Specifically, with a $\phi$-mixing model of
data dependence, we show that online SGD with proper periodic data-subsampling
achieves an improved sample complexity over the standard online SGD in the full
spectrum of the data dependence level. Interestingly, even subsampling a subset
of data samples can accelerate the convergence of online SGD over highly

further substantially improve the sample complexity over online SGD with
periodic data-subsampling over highly dependent data. Numerical experiments

chronic disease risk and mortality. Since the mid-20th century, there have been
significant changes in dietary patterns, and men's testosterone levels have
declined in western countries. Cross-sectional studies show inconsistent
associations between fat intake and testosterone in men.
  Methods: Studies eligible for inclusion were intervention studies, with
minimal confounding variables, comparing the effect of low-fat vs high-fat
diets on men's sex hormones. 9 databases were searched from their inception to
October 2020, yielding 6 eligible studies, with a total of 206 participants.
Random effects meta-analyses were performed using Cochrane's Review Manager
software. Cochrane's risk of bias tool was used for quality assessment.
  Results: There were significant decreases in sex hormones on low-fat vs
high-fat diets. Standardised mean differences with 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for outcomes were: total testosterone [-0.38 (95% CI -0.75 to -0.01) P =
0.04]; free testosterone [-0.37 (95% CI -0.63 to -0.11) P = 0.005]; urinary
testosterone [-0.38 (CI 95% -0.66 to -0.09) P = 0.009], and dihydrotestosterone
[-0.3 (CI 95% -0.56 to -0.03) P = 0.03]. There were no significant differences
for luteinising hormone or sex hormone binding globulin. Subgroup analysis for
total testosterone, European and American men, showed a stronger effect [-0.52
(95% CI -0.75 to -0.3) P < 0.001].
  Conclusions: Low-fat diets appear to decrease testosterone levels in men, but
further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this effect. Men
with European ancestry may experience a greater decrease in testosterone, in
response to a low-fat diet.

to contaminate the intermediate feature outputs of local models, and then
directly employ the crafted adversarial samples to attack the target model. Due
to the transferability of features, feature-level attacks have shown promise in
synthesizing more transferable adversarial samples. However, existing
feature-level attacks generally employ inaccurate neuron importance
estimations, which deteriorates their transferability. To overcome such

networks (WSN) which often consist of low-capability sensors. Holes can form in
WSNs due to the problems during placement of the sensors or power/hardware
failure. In these situations, sensing or transmitting data could be affected
and can interrupt the normal operation of the WSNs. It may also decrease the
lifetime of the network and sensing coverage of the sensors. The problem of
hole detection is especially challenging in WSNs since the exact location of
the sensors is often unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel hole detection
approach called FD-CNN which is based on Force-directed (FD) Algorithm and
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In contrast to existing approaches, FD-CNN
is a centralized approach and is able to detect holes from WSNs without relying
on the information related to the location of the sensors. The proposed
approach also alleviates the problem of high computational complexity in
distributed approaches. The proposed approach accepts the network topology of a
WSN as an input and generates the identity of the nodes surrounding each
detected hole in the network as the final output. In the proposed approach, an
FD algorithm is used to generate the layout of the wireless sensor networks
followed by the identification of the holes in the layouts using a trained CNN
model. In order to prepare labeled datasets for training the CNN model, an
unsupervised pre-processing method is also proposed in this paper. After the
holes are detected by the CNN model, two algorithms are proposed to identify
the regions of the holes and corresponding nodes surrounding the regions.
Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach based on
different datasets. Experimental results show that FD-CNN can achieve 80%
sensitivity and 93% specificity in less than 2 minutes.

FD algorithms are mainly designed for visualizing static graphs in which the

scale well, since any changes in the topology will trigger these algorithms to

propose a design and implementation of five online FD algorithms to visualize
dynamic graphs while maintaining their native force models. The online FD
algorithms developed in this paper are able to reuse the force models of
existing FD algorithms without significant modifications. To evaluate the

  Dimensionality","No comments",,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents an alternate representation framework to commonly used
time-frequency representation for acoustic scene classification (ASC). A raw
audio signal is represented using a pre-trained convolutional neural network
(CNN) using its various intermediate layers. The study assumes that the
representations obtained from the intermediate layers lie in low-dimensions
intrinsically. To obtain low-dimensional embeddings, principal component
analysis is performed, and the study analyzes that only a few principal
components are significant. However, the appropriate number of significant
components are not known. To address this, an automatic dictionary learning
framework is utilized that approximates the underlying subspace. Further, the
low-dimensional embeddings are aggregated in a late-fusion manner in the
ensemble framework to incorporate hierarchical information learned at various
intermediate layers. The experimental evaluation is performed on publicly
available DCASE 2017 and 2018 ASC datasets on a pre-trained 1-D CNN, SoundNet.
Empirically, it is observed that deeper layers show more compression ratio than
others. At 70% compression ratio across different datasets, the performance is
similar to that obtained without performing any dimensionality reduction. The
proposed framework outperforms the time-frequency representation based methods.

In contrast to existing approaches, the proposed approach is a pure

network topology without relying on the physical locations of the anchor nodes.
In FD-TL, a Force-directed Algorithm is used to generate a series of possible

used to recognize potential coverage holes from the generated layouts. During
the training phase, a transfer learning method is used to aid the recognition

Traditional sequence labeling frameworks treat the entity types as class IDs

names word-by-word explicitly after generating the entities. During training,
LASER refines the label semantics by updating the label surface name
representations and also strengthens the label-region correlation. In this way,
LASER recognizes the entities from document images through both semantic and

approach is then tested via a case study in which the fine-tuned models are

Vehicle (IoV) technologies that can utilize the information provided by various
sensors and wireless communication to perform complex functionality. Many of
these functionalities rely on high computational power and low latency. Mobile
Edge Computing (MEC) technologies have been proposed as a way to meet these
requirements, as their proximity and decentralization provide unique benefits
for networks like real-time communication, higher throughput, and flexibility.
Diverse challenges to the process of offloading data in a MEC-enabled IoV
network have emerged, such as offloading reliability in highly mobile
environments, security for users within the same network, and energy management
to keep users from being disincentivized to participate in the network. This
article surveys research studies that use AI as part of the data offloading
process, categorized based on four main issues: reliability, security, energy
management, and service seller profit. Afterward, this article discusses
challenges and future perspectives for IoV technologies.

for multiparty quantum states can be considered as analogous to online meetings
between members of a population. Moreover, monotonicity properties of quantum
and classical correlations of quantum states of shared systems also carry over
to relations between members of the population, giving rise to what may be
termed as a second law of anthropology.

  diversification","One Earth (2022)",,"10.1016/j.oneear.2022.02.007",,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The emergence and impact of tipping points have garnered significant interest
in both the social and natural sciences. Despite widespread recognition of the
importance of feedbacks between human and natural systems, it is often assumed
that the observed nonlinear dynamics in these coupled systems rests within
either underlying human or natural processes, rather than the rates at which
they interact. Using adoption of agricultural diversification practices as a
case study, we show how two stable management paradigms (one dominated by
conventional, homogeneous practices, the other by diversified practices) can
emerge purely from temporal feedbacks between human decisions and ecological
responses. We explore how this temporal mechanism of tipping points provides
insight into designing more effective interventions that promote farmers
transitions towards sustainable agriculture. Moreover, our flexible modeling
framework could be applied to other cases to provide insight into numerous
questions in social-ecological systems research and environmental policy.
