provide a unified theoretical framework, a quantitative geometric approach, to

tool to describe the energy balance of the solar atmosphere. Current
investigations on energy flux in the solar atmosphere focus primarily on the
vertical electromagnetic flux through the photosphere, ignoring the Poynting
flux in other directions and its possible contributions to local heating. Based
on a realistic Bifrost simulation of a quiet-Sun (coronal hole) atmosphere, we
find that the total electromagnetic energy flux in the photosphere occurs
mainly parallel to the photosphere, concentrating in small regions along
intergranular lanes. Thereby, it was possible to define a proxy for this energy
flux based on only variables that can be promptly retrieved from observations,
namely, horizontal velocities of the small-scale magnetic elements and their
longitudinal magnetic flux. Our proxy accurately describes the actual Poynting
flux distribution in the simulations, with the electromagnetic energy flux
reaching $10^{10}$ erg\,cm$^{-2}$\,s$^{-1}$. To validate our findings, we
extended the analysis to SUNRISE/IMaX data. First, we show that Bifrost
realistically describes photospheric quiet-Sun regions, as the simulation
presents similar distributions for line-of-sight magnetic flux and horizontal
velocity field. Second, we found very similar horizontal Poynting flux proxy
distributions for the simulated photosphere and observational data. Our results
also indicate that the horizontal Poynting flux in the observations is
considerably larger than the vertical electromagnetic flux from previous
observational estimates. Therefore, our analysis confirms that the
electromagnetic energy flux in the photosphere is mainly horizontal and is most
intense in localized regions along intergranular lanes.

construct estimates of free energies and ensemble averages using the Multistate
Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) formalism. However, the error of the MBAR
estimator is not well-understood: previous error analysis of MBAR assumed
independent samples and did not permit attributing contributions to the total
error to individual thermodynamic states. In this work, we derive a novel
central limit theorem for MBAR estimates. This central limit theorem yields an
error estimator which can be decomposed into contributions from the individual
Markov chains used to sample the states. We demonstrate the error estimator for
an umbrella sampling calculation of the alanine dipeptide in two dimensions and
an alchemical calculation of the hydration free energy of methane. In both

effects on patient outcomes. Here, the gold standard for estimating causal
effects are randomized controlled trials; however, such trials are costly and
sometimes even unethical. Instead, medical practice is increasingly interested
in estimating causal effects among patient (sub)groups from electronic health
records, that is, observational data. In this paper, we aim at estimating the
average causal effect (ACE) from observational data (patient trajectories) that
are collected over time. For this, we propose DeepACE: an end-to-end deep
learning model. DeepACE leverages the iterative G-computation formula to adjust
for the bias induced by time-varying confounders. Moreover, we develop a novel
sequential targeting procedure which ensures that DeepACE has favorable
theoretical properties, i.e., is doubly robust and asymptotically efficient. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes an end-to-end
deep learning model tailored for estimating time-varying ACEs. We compare
DeepACE in an extensive number of experiments, confirming that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We further provide a case study for patients
suffering from low back pain to demonstrate that DeepACE generates important
and meaningful findings for clinical practice. Our work enables practitioners
to develop effective treatment recommendations based on population effects.

from several industries and areas of research, one side argues that research
productivity is currently in decline. The other side disputes this conclusion.
It contends that the data used in making this argument are selective and
limited; they do not reflect the overall state of research. The conclusion that
follows from this critique is that the indicators of research productivity we
currently use are not reliable and do not warrant a definitive answer to the
problem.
  The article agrees that we need a new set of indicators in assessing research
productivity. It proposes that we should look at global indicators related to
knowledge production in general, rather than look at selective data that are
inevitably limited in their scope. The article argues that the process of
creation plays the essential role in knowledge production. Therefore, the
perspective that uses the process of creation as its central organizing
principle offers a unique and global view on the production of knowledge and
makes a definitive resolution of the controversy possible. The article also
outlines some steps for improving research productivity and realizing the full
potential of the human capacity to produce knowledge.
  Key words: Research productivity, knowledge growth, the process of creation,
levels of organization, equilibration and the production of disequilibrium.

faster. We generate grids of synthetic transmission spectra and their
corresponding planetary and atmospheric parameters, one using free chemistry
models, and the other using equilibrium chemistry models. Each grid is
subsequently rebinned to simulate both HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec observations,
yielding four datasets in total. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
trained with each of the datasets. We perform retrievals on a 1,000 simulated
observations for each combination of model type and instrument with nested

on real WFC3 transmission spectra. Finally, we test how robust machine learning

a lower coefficient of determination between predicted and true values of the
parameters. Nested sampling underestimates the uncertainty in ~8% of

nested sampling and machine learning agree within $2\sigma$ for ~86% of

empirical phenomenon has been widely observed in the last-layer classifiers and

to the vertices of a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) up to scaling, and
(ii) cross-example within-class variability of last-layer activations collapses

place regardless of the choice of loss functions. In this work, we justify NC
under the mean squared error (MSE) loss, where recent empirical evidence shows
that it performs comparably or even better than the de-facto cross-entropy
loss. Under a simplified unconstrained feature model, we provide the first
global landscape analysis for vanilla nonconvex MSE loss and show that the
(only!) global minimizers are neural collapse solutions, while all other
critical points are strict saddles whose Hessian exhibit negative curvature
directions. Furthermore, we justify the usage of rescaled MSE loss by probing
the optimization landscape around the NC solutions, showing that the landscape
can be improved by tuning the rescaling hyperparameters. Finally, our
theoretical findings are experimentally verified on practical network
architectures.

for submodular optimization, which have been motivated by the wide
applicability of submodular functions in real-world data-science problems. In
this paper, we contribute to this line of work by considering the problem of
robust submodular maximization against unexpected deletions, which may occur
due to privacy issues or user preferences. Specifically, we consider the
minimum number of items an algorithm has to remember, in order to achieve a
non-trivial approximation guarantee against adversarial deletion of up to $d$
items. We refer to the set of items that an algorithm has to keep before
adversarial deletions as a deletion-robust coreset.
  Our theoretical contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a single-pass
streaming algorithm that yields a $(1-2\epsilon)/(4p)$-approximation for
maximizing a non-decreasing submodular function under a general p-matroid
constraint and requires a coreset of size $k + d/\epsilon$, where $k$ is the
maximum size of a feasible solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to achieve an (asymptotically) optimal coreset, as no
constant-factor approximation is possible with a coreset of size sublinear in
$d$. Second, we devise an effective offline algorithm that guarantees stronger
approximation ratios with a coreset of size $O(d \log(k)/\epsilon)$. We also
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithms in
real-life applications.

However, photoexcitation can have the opposite effect: recent experiments have
shown an increasing phase coherence in optimally doped BSCCO with mid-infrared
driving. Time-resolved terahertz spectroscopies are powerful techniques to
excite and probe non-equilibrium states of superconductors, directly addressing
collective modes, such as amplitude (Higgs) oscillations. In this work, we
calculate the full time evolution of the current generated by a cuprate with a
quench-drive spectroscopy setup. Analyzing the response in Fourier space with
respect to both the real time and the quench-drive delay time, we look for the
signature of a transient modulation of higher harmonics as well as the Higgs
mode, in order to characterize the ground state phase. In particular, this

applicable to the density-of-states approach to complex action problems. In
particular, flow-based sampling may be used to compute the density directly, in
contradistinction to the conventional strategy of reconstructing it via
measuring and integrating the derivative of its logarithm. By circumventing
this procedure, the accumulation of errors from the numerical integration is
avoided completely and the overall normalization factor can be determined
explicitly. In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate our method in the

explicitly broken by an imaginary external field. First, we concentrate on the
zero-dimensional case which can be solved exactly. We show that with our

introduce WaveY-Net, a hybrid data- and physics-augmented convolutional neural
network that can predict electromagnetic field distributions with ultra fast
speeds and high accuracy for entire classes of dielectric photonic structures.
This accuracy is achieved by training the neural network to learn only the
magnetic near-field distributions of a system and to use a discrete formalism
of Maxwell's equations in two ways: as physical constraints in the loss
function and as a means to calculate the electric fields from the magnetic
fields. As a model system, we construct a surrogate simulator for periodic
silicon nanostructure arrays and show that the high speed simulator can be
directly and effectively used in the local and global freeform optimization of
metagratings. We anticipate that physics-augmented networks will serve as a
viable Maxwell simulator replacement for many classes of photonic systems,
transforming the way they are designed.

combination of any existing 3D backbone architectures with different task
heads. Under the EQ-Paradigm, the input is firstly encoded in the embedding
stage with an arbitrary feature extraction architecture, which is independent
of tasks and heads. Then, the querying stage enables the encoded features to be
applicable for diverse task heads. This is achieved by introducing an
intermediate representation, i.e., Q-representation, in the querying stage to
serve as a bridge between the embedding stage and task heads. We design a novel
Q- Net as the querying stage network. Extensive experimental results on various
3D tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation and shape
classification, show that EQ-Paradigm in tandem with Q-Net is a general and
effective pipeline, which enables a flexible collaboration of backbones and

to be a powerful and versatile concept with implications far beyond its
original intent. This stringent notion -- that predictions be well-calibrated
across a rich class of intersecting subpopulations -- provides its strong
guarantees at a cost: the computational and sample complexity of learning
multicalibrated predictors are high, and grow exponentially with the number of
class labels. In contrast, the relaxed notion of multiaccuracy can be achieved
more efficiently, yet many of the most desirable properties of multicalibration
cannot be guaranteed assuming multiaccuracy alone. This tension raises a key
question: Can we learn predictors with multicalibration-style guarantees at a
cost commensurate with multiaccuracy?
  In this work, we define and initiate the study of Low-Degree
Multicalibration. Low-Degree Multicalibration defines a hierarchy of
increasingly-powerful multi-group fairness notions that spans multiaccuracy and
the original formulation of multicalibration at the extremes. Our main
technical contribution demonstrates that key properties of multicalibration,
related to fairness and accuracy, actually manifest as low-degree properties.
Importantly, we show that low-degree multicalibration can be significantly more
efficient than full multicalibration. In the multi-class setting, the sample
complexity to achieve low-degree multicalibration improves exponentially (in
the number of classes) over full multicalibration. Our work presents compelling
evidence that low-degree multicalibration represents a sweet spot, pairing
computational and sample efficiency with strong fairness and accuracy
guarantees.

metallicity of extremely metal-poor stars from medium-resolution spectroscopy.
Unfortunately, these lines can overlap with absorption produced in the
intervening interstellar medium, introducing systematic errors in the derived
metallicities. The strength of the Ca~II infrared triplet lines can also be
measured at extremely low metallicities, and it is not affected by interstellar
absorption, but suffers significant departures from Local Thermodynamical
Equilibrium (LTE). We investigate the feasibility of adopting the Ca~II
infrared triplet as a metallicity indicator in extremely metal-poor stars using
state-of-the art Non-LTE models including the most recent atomic data. We find
that the triplet lines exhibit Non-LTE abundance corrections that can exceed
0.5\,dex. When interstellar absorption affecting the Ca~II resonance lines is
accounted for using high-resolution observations, the agreement between Non-LTE
abundances for the triplet and those for the resonance lines, with only minor
departures from LTE, is excellent. Non-LTE effects strengthen the Ca~II IR
triplet lines, facilitating measurements at very low metallicities, compared
with LTE estimates, down to $\rm [Fe/H]=-6.0$. This result has important
implications for the discovery of primitive stars in our Galaxy and others,
since instruments are most sensitive at red/near-infrared wavelengths, and tens

predict the overlapping match score, with 90\% of accuracy, of new synthetic
samples. These are encouraging results for using GANs for data augmentation and
interpolation in the context of GWs, to cover the full parameter space of, say,
exotic compact binaries, without the need of intensive numerical relativity
simulations.

prove a duality formula for the ic-resurgence of edge ideals. We show that the
ic-resurgence of the edge ideal $I$ of a clutter $\mathcal{C}$ and the
ic-resurgence of the edge ideal $I^\vee$ of the blocker $\mathcal{C}^\vee$ of
$\mathcal{C}$ coincide. If $\mathcal{C}$ is the clutter of bases of certain
uniform matroids, we recover a formula for the resurgence of $I$, and if
$\mathcal{C}$ is a connected non-bipartite graph with a perfect matching, we
show a formula for the Waldschmidt constant of $I^\vee$.

finitely-supported measures to the classes of signed or non-negative measures
supported on algebraic varieties of any dimension. In particular, we show that
the Zariski closure of the support of these measures is determined by finitely
many moments and can be computed from the kernel of certain moment matrices.

and generic transients associated with gamma-ray burst events observed during
the joint run. No gravitational-wave events were identified. We evaluate the
minimum detectable amplitude for various types of transient signals and the
spacetime volume for which the network is sensitive to binary neutron-star
coalescences. We also place lower limits on the distances to the gamma-ray
bursts analysed based on the non-detection of an associated gravitational-wave

stochastic Nash games using stochastic approximation (SA) schemes. PoS is
amongst the most popular metrics in game theory and provides an avenue for
estimating the efficiency of Nash games. In particular, knowing the value of
PoS can help significantly with designing efficient networked systems,
including transportation networks and power market mechanisms. Motivated by the
lack of efficient methods for computing the PoS, first we consider stochastic
optimization problems with a nonsmooth and merely convex objective function and
a merely monotone stochastic variational inequality (SVI) constraint. This
problem appears in the numerator of the PoS. We develop a randomized
block-coordinate stochastic extra-(sub)gradient method where we employ a novel
iterative penalization scheme to account for the mapping of the SVI in each of
the two gradient updates of the algorithm. We obtain an iteration complexity of
the order $\epsilon^{-4}$ that appears to be best known result for this class
of constrained stochastic optimization problems. Second, we develop an SA-based
scheme for approximating the PoS and derive lower and upper bounds on the
approximation error. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide some
preliminary simulation results on a stochastic Nash Cournot competition over a
network.

significant information about the mutual transformation of the poloidal and
toroidal components of the global solar magnetic field. The direction of the
toroidal field determines the polarity of leading sunspots in ARs in accordance
with the Hale's polarity law. The vast majority of bipolar ARs obey this
regularity, whereas a few percent of ARs have the opposite sense of polarity
(anti-Hale ARs). However, the study of these ARs is hampered by their poor
statistics. The data for five 11-year cycles (16-18 and 23,24) were combined
here to compile a synthetic cycle of unique time length and latitudinal width.
The synthetic cycle comprises data for 14838 ARs and 367 of them are the
anti-Hale ARs. A specific routine to compile the synthetic cycle was
demonstrated. We found that, in general, anti-Hale ARs follow the solar cycle
and are spread throughout the time-latitude diagram evenly, which implies their
fundamental connection with the global dynamo mechanism and the toroidal flux
system. The increase in their number and percentage occurs in the second part
of the cycle, which is in favour of their contribution to the polar field
reversal. The excess in the anti-Hale ARs percentage at the edges of the
butterfly diagram and near an oncoming solar minimum (where the toroidal field
weakens) might be associated with strengthening of the influence of turbulent
convection and magnetic field fluctuations on the arising flux tubes. The
evidence of the misalignment between the magnetic and heliographic equators is
also found.

physics is well understood for isotropic superconductors, the experimental
investigation of the physics of anisotropic superconductors near a critical
B-point remains an unattained goal mainly due to the unavailability of model
material systems. Theoretically, such superconductors are expected to show
type-I or type-II behaviour for definite directions of an applied magnetic
field. Here, from directional point-contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy and
field-angle dependent ac magnetic susceptibility measurements, we show that
ZrB$_{12}$ is an anisotropic superconductor, and it exhibits field-direction

well with the theoretical expectations for an anisotropic superconductor near a

and wasted computational resources due to the difficulty of simultaneously
converging all mechanistically relevant reactive intermediates to expected
geometries and electronic states. We demonstrate a dynamic classifier approach,
i.e., a convolutional neural network that monitors geometry optimization on the
fly, and exploit its good performance and transferability for catalyst design.
We show that the dynamic classifier performs well on all reactive intermediates
in the representative catalytic cycle of the radical rebound mechanism for
methane-to-methanol despite being trained on only one reactive intermediate.
The dynamic classifier also generalizes to chemically distinct intermediates
and metal centers absent from the training data without loss of accuracy or
model confidence. We rationalize this superior model transferability to the use
of on-the-fly electronic structure and geometric information generated from
density functional theory calculations and the convolutional layer in the
dynamic classifier. Combined with model uncertainty quantification, the dynamic
classifier saves more than half of the computational resources that would have
been wasted on unsuccessful calculations for all reactive intermediates being

electron-electron interaction plays a direct and prominent role in the
low-temperature electrical transport of compressed CsPbI3 and renders Fermi
liquid (FL)-like behavior. By compressing {\delta}-CsPbI3 to 80 GPa, an
insulator-to-metal transition occurs, concomitant with the completion of a
sluggish structural transition from the one-dimensional (1D) Pnma ({\delta})
phase to a 3D Pmn21 ({\epsilon}) phase. Deviation from FL behavior is observed
in CsPbI3 upon entering the metallic {\epsilon} phase, which progressively
evolves into a FL-like state at 186 GPa. First-principles density functional
theory calculations reveal that the enhanced electron-electron coupling is
related to the Cs-involved electron transfer and sudden increase of the 5d

promising strategy for tuning the electronic interaction in halide perovskites

provides detailed microscopic information at the level of individual monomers
at a lower computational cost by replacing the monomer-based model in parts of
the simulated filament by a rod-based macroscopic model. In the monomer-based
description, G-actin is represented by ellipsoids bound at the surface in a
double helical configuration to form F-actin. The rod-based model is coarser,
in which F-actin is described using a Cosserat model, as seen in the preceding
paper [arXiv:2112.01480]. The multi-resolution methodology is illustrated using
three case studies, designed to test the properties of F-actin under
stretching, bending, shearing and twisting. The methodology is especially
suited for situations where filaments are subject to bending deformations. We
investigate the limitations of using the standard Cosserat model to capture the
complete torsional behaviour of F-actin, presenting its extensions which
account for curvature dependent rigidities and a twist-stretch coupling to
improve accuracy of the overall multi-resolution scheme.

human-robot turn-taking and sequential task planning. However, the physical
interaction establishes a rich channel of communication through forces, torques

of human-robot interaction. In this work, we investigate the role of haptics in
human collaborative physical tasks, to identify how to integrate physical
communication in human-robot teams. We present a task to balance a ball at a
target position on a board either bimanually by one participant, or dyadically
by two participants, with and without haptic information. The task requires
that the two sides coordinate with each other, in real-time, to balance the
ball at the target. We found that with training the completion time and number
of velocity peaks of the ball decreased, and that participants gradually became
consistent in their braking strategy. Moreover we found that the presence of
haptic information improved the performance (decreased completion time) and led
to an increase in overall cooperative movements. Overall, our results show that
humans can better coordinate with one another when haptic feedback is

acknowledged. This study aims to elucidate the effect of congestion avoidance
of agents given congestion information on optimizing traffic in a network
topology. We investigated stochastic traffic networks in a star topology with a
central node connected to isolated secondary nodes with different preferences.
Each agent at the central node selects a secondary node by referring to the
declining preferences based on the congestion rate of the secondary nodes. We
examined two scenarios: 1) Each agent can repeatedly visit the central and
secondary nodes. 2) Each agent can access each secondary node only once. For
1), we investigated the uniformity of the agent distribution in a stationary
state, and for 2), we measured the travel time for all agents visiting all
nodes. When agents repeatedly visit central and other nodes, the uniformity of
agent distribution has been found to show three types of nonlinear dependence
on the increase in nodes. We found that multivariate statistics describe these
characteristic dependences well, suggesting that the balance between the
equalization of network usage by avoiding congestion and the covariance caused
by mutual referral to congestion information determines the uniformity. We
discovered that congestion-avoidance linearizes the travel time, which
increases exponentially with the number of nodes, notwithstanding the degree of
reference to the congestion information. Consequently, we successfully
described the optimization effect of congestion-avoidance on the collective
dynamics of agents in star topologies. Our findings are useful in many areas of

failures at only a few nodes may trigger a process of sequential failure. We
applied a flow redistribution model to investigate the robustness against

such a system, the coupling coefficients between networks, which determine how
much flows/loads are redistributed between networks, are a key factor
determining the robustness to cascading failures. We derive recursive

reinforcement learning (RL). A promising avenue for improving the robustness of
RL agents is through the use of curricula. One such class of methods frames
environment design as a game between a student and a teacher, using
regret-based objectives to produce environment instantiations (or levels) at
the frontier of the student agent's capabilities. These methods benefit from
their generality, with theoretical guarantees at equilibrium, yet they often
struggle to find effective levels in challenging design spaces. By contrast,
evolutionary approaches seek to incrementally alter environment complexity,
resulting in potentially open-ended learning, but often rely on domain-specific
heuristics and vast amounts of computational resources. In this paper we
propose to harness the power of evolution in a principled, regret-based
curriculum. Our approach, which we call Adversarially Compounding Complexity by
Editing Levels (ACCEL), seeks to constantly produce levels at the frontier of
an agent's capabilities, resulting in curricula that start simple but become
increasingly complex. ACCEL maintains the theoretical benefits of prior
regret-based methods, while providing significant empirical gains in a diverse

of the machine to extract features from the supplied dataset (e.g., made of

A
celebrated example in optics is the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, where the bunching
of two photons arises from a destructive quantum interference between the
trajectories where they both either cross a beam splitter or are reflected.
This effect takes its roots in the indistinguishability of identical photons.
Hence, it is generally admitted -- and experimentally verified -- that bunching
vanishes as soon as photons can be distinguished, e.g., when they occupy
distinct time bins or have different polarizations. Here we disproof this
alleged straightforward link between indistinguishability and bunching by
exploiting a recent finding in the theory of matrix permanents. We exhibit a
family of optical circuits where the bunching of photons into two modes can be
significantly boosted by making them partially distinguishable via an
appropriate polarization pattern. This boosting effect is already visible in a
7-photon interferometric process, making the observation of this phenomenon
within reach of current photonic technology. This unexpected behavior questions
our understanding of multiparticle interference in the grey zone between
indistinguishable bosons and classical particles.

an explosion of interest in multimodal representation learning, these methods
are still largely focused on a small set of modalities, primarily in the

towards diverse and understudied modalities, this paper studies efficient
representation learning for high-modality scenarios. Since adding new models
for every new modality or task becomes prohibitively expensive, a critical
technical challenge is heterogeneity quantification: how can we measure which
modalities encode similar information and interactions in order to permit
parameter sharing with previous modalities? We propose two new
information-theoretic metrics for heterogeneity quantification: (1) modality
heterogeneity studies how similar 2 modalities $\{X_1,X_2\}$ are by measuring
how much information can be transferred from $X_1$ to $X_2$, while (2)
interaction heterogeneity studies how similarly pairs of modalities
$\{X_1,X_2\}, \{X_3,X_4\}$ interact by measuring how much interaction
information can be transferred from $\{X_1,X_2\}$ to $\{X_3,X_4\}$. We show the
importance of these proposed metrics in high-modality scenarios as a way to
automatically prioritize the fusion of modalities that contain unique
information or interactions. The result is a single model, HighMMT, that scales
up to $10$ modalities and $15$ tasks from $5$ different research areas. Not
only does HighMMT outperform prior methods on the tradeoff between performance
and efficiency, it also demonstrates a crucial scaling behavior: performance
continues to improve with each modality added, and transfers to entirely new
modalities and tasks during fine-tuning.

conspicuous, loop-like structure that fills almost half of the northern
Galactic hemisphere, called Loop I. The interior of Loop I is shining in soft
X-rays, and its eastern base is a bright, elongated structure dubbed the North
Polar Spur (NPS). After 40 years of debates, two contradictory views of Loop
I/NPS are still defended: on the one hand, the NPS is a volume of expanding hot
gas that envelops and extends the northern Fermi Bubble (FB) known to be blown
by the Galactic center, and Loop I marks the shock front; on the other hand,
the NPS is a nearby cavity of hot gas blown by supernovae, Loop I is its shock
front and they are coincidentally located in the direction of the FB. To an
observer at the Sun, both structures can produce the same perspective view,
although the former has a size comparable to the Milky Way itself, and the
latter a diameter of a few hundreds parsecs. The energy involved varies by
3-4~orders of magnitude, and the solution has various important consequences. I
discuss recent results which have a connection with Loop I/NPS, overlooked or
used as arguments in the two opposite ways. They involve very different
spacecraft, from a 12 Kg Cubesat (HaloSat) to major space-borne observatories
(HST, Gaia, and Spektr-RG). I make use of 3D~maps of dust and a massive star
catalog. Considering all constraints, it is clear that there is no entirely
local or entirely distant scenario that is free from contradictions with some
of the data analyses or from improbable coincidences. I discuss a speculative
scenario, partially inspired by recent BF and Milky Way gas models, combining
near and far aspects and seeming to be able to meet the various constraints.
However, new data and models are needed to bring the controversy to a close and
we can still expect new episodes of this long story.

interactions, a simple picture based on well-defined Floquet quasiparticles
suggests that the system should host a quasisteady state current that depends
only on the populations of the system's Floquet-Bloch bands and their
associated quasienergy winding numbers. Here we show that such topological
transport persists into the strongly interacting regime where the
single-particle lifetime becomes shorter than the drive period. Analytically,
we show that the value of the current is insensitive to interaction-induced
band renormalizations and lifetime broadening when certain conditions are met
by the system's non-equilibrium distribution function. We show that these
conditions correspond to a quasisteady state. We support these predictions
through numerical simulation of a system of strongly interacting fermions in a
periodically-modulated chain of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dots. Our work establishes
universal transport at high entropy density as a robust far from equilibrium
topological phenomenon, which can be readily realized with cold atoms in

be reduced. As a consequence, the numerical artefacts are dominated by
dispersion errors commonly known as wiggles. In this study, we explore possible
remedies in the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method by applying novel
collision kernels, lattices with a large number of discrete velocities, namely
D3Q27, and second-order boundary conditions. For the first time, the
cumulant-based collision operator is utilised to simulate both the hydrodynamic
and the thermal field. Alternatively, the advected field is computed using the
central moments' collision operator. Different relaxation strategies have been
examined to account for additional degrees of freedom introduced by a
higher-order lattice. To validate the proposed kernels for a pure
advection-diffusion problem, the numerical simulations are compared against an
analytical solution of a Gaussian hill. The structure of the numerical
dispersion is shown by simulating advection and diffusion of a square indicator
function. Finally, a study of steady forced heat convection from a confined
cylinder is performed and compared against a FEM solution. Numerical results
confirm that the relaxation scheme of the advected field must be adjusted to
profit from lattice with a larger number of discrete velocities. In all of the

suggesting the occurrence of several distinct star-formation episodes. The
large fraction of second population (2P) stars observed requires a very large
2P gaseous mass to have accumulated in the cluster core to form these stars.
Hence the first population of stars (1P) in the cluster core has had to become
embedded in 2P gas, just prior to the formation of later populations. Here we
explore the evolution of binaries in ambient 2P gaseous media of
multiple-population GCs. We mostly focus on black hole binaries and follow
their evolution as they evolve from wide binaries towards short periods through
interaction with ambient gas, followed by gravitational-wave (GW) dominated
inspiral and merger. We show this novel GW-merger channel could provide a major
contribution to the production of GW-sources. We consider various assumptions
and initial conditions and calculate the resulting gas-mediated change in the
population of binaries and the expected merger rates due to gas-catalyzed
GW-inspirals. For plausible conditions and assumptions, we find an expected GW
merger rate observable by aLIGO of the order of up to a few tens of
$\rm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$, and an overall range for our various models of
$0.08-25.51 \ \rm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$. Finally, our results suggest that the
conditions and binary properties in the early stage of GCs could be critically
affected by gas-interactions and may require a major revision in the current
modeling of the evolution of GCs.

extended gaseous distributions. We consider how hydrodynamic (surface area)
drag forces and dynamical friction (gravitational) drag forces drive the

eccentric orbits to become more circular, dynamical friction drag can cause
orbits to become more eccentric. We develop a semi-analytic model that
accurately predicts these changes by comparing the total work and torque
applied to the orbit at periapse and apoapse. We use a toy model of a radial
power-law density profile, $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma}$, to determine that there
is a critical $\gamma = 3$ power index which separates the eccentricity
evolution in dynamical friction: orbits become more eccentric for $\gamma < 3$
and circularize for $\gamma > 3$. We apply these findings to the infall of a
Jupiter-like planet into the envelope of its host star. The hydrostatic
envelopes of stars are defined by steep density gradients near the limb and
shallower gradients in the interior. Under the influence of gaseous dynamical
friction, an infalling object's orbit will first decrease in eccentricity, then
increase. The critical separation that delineates these regimes is predicted by
the local density slope and is linearly dependent on polytropic index. More
broadly, our findings indicate that binary systems may routinely emerge from
common envelope phases with non-zero eccentricities that were excited by the
dynamical friction forces that drove their orbital tightening.

gauge-breaking errors has recently been addressed, but no scheme has been able
to reliably stabilize disorder-free localization through all accessible
evolution times while preserving the disorder-free property. Here, we introduce
the concept of \textit{Stark gauge protection}, which entails a linear sum in
gauge-symmetry local (pseudo)generators weighted by a Stark potential. Using
exact diagonalization and Krylov-based methods, we show how this scheme can
stabilize or even enhance disorder-free localization against gauge-breaking
errors in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories up to all
accessible evolution times, without inducing \textit{bona fide} Stark many-body
localization. We show through a Magnus expansion that the dynamics under Stark
gauge protection is described by an effective Hamiltonian where gauge-breaking
terms are suppressed locally by the protection strength and additionally by the
matter site index, which we argue is the main reason behind stabilizing the
localization up to all accessible times. Our scheme is readily feasible in
modern ultracold-atom experiments and Rydberg-atom setups with optical

SED ages of clusters with concentrated (1-2 Myr) and partially exposed HII
region morphologies (2-3 Myr) indicate a relatively early onset of gas clearing
and a short (1-2 Myr) clearing timescale. 2) The reddening of clusters can be
overestimated due to the presence of red supergiants, which is a result of
stochastic sampling of the IMF in low mass clusters. 3) The age-reddening
degeneracy impacts the results of the SED fitting - out of 1408 clusters with
M$_*$ $\geq$ 5000 M$_{\odot}$, we find that at least 46 (3%) have SED ages
which appear significantly underestimated or overestimated based on H$\alpha$
and their environment, while the total percentage of poor age estimates is
expected to be several times larger. 4) Lastly, we examine the dependence of
the morphological classifications on spatial resolution. At HST resolution, our
conclusions are robust to the distance range spanned by the sample (3-10 Mpc).

dominant variability timescale and, by inference, a possible mechanism
responsible for the variation. We gathered 10 or more high-resolution spectra
each of 10 stars using the TRES spectrograph at times chosen to span all phases
of stellar rotation, as determined from photometric data from the MEarth
Observatories. All stars varied in their H$\alpha$ emission. For 9 of these
stars, we found no correlation between H$\alpha$ and rotational phase,
indicating that constant emission from fixed magnetic structures, such as
starspots and plage, are unlikely to be the dominant source of H$\alpha$
emission variability. In contrast, one star, G 7-34, shows a clear relationship
between H$\alpha$ and stellar rotational phase. Intriguingly, we found that
this star is a member of the AB Doradus moving group and hence has the young
age of 149 Myr. High-cadence spectroscopic observations of three additional
stars revealed that they are variable on timescales ranging from 20--45
minutes, which we posit may be due to flaring behavior. For one star, GJ 1111,
simultaneous TESS photometry and spectroscopic monitoring show an increase in
H$\alpha$ emission with increased photometric brightness. We conclude that
low-energy flares are able to produce variation in H$\alpha$ on the timescales

three methods of i) [CII] luminosity and a [CII]-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factor
reported in local metal-poor dwarf galaxies, ii) a dust mass and
metallicity-dependent dust-to-gas mass ratio, and iii) a dynamical mass
estimate, we obtain the molecular gas mass ($M_{\rm mol}$) to be
$(0.05-11)\times10^{10} M_{\rm \odot}$, which is consistent with its upper
limit inferred from the non-detection of mid-$J$ CO and [CI](2-1). Albeit with
large uncertainty in $M_{\rm mol}$, we estimate a high molecular gas-to-stellar
mass ratio ($\mu_{\rm gas}$) of $0.65-140$ and a short gas depletion time
($t_{\rm dep}$) of $2.5-550$ Myr, which are broadly consistent with
extrapolations of $\mu_{\rm gas}$ and $t_{\rm dep}$ as functions of redshift,
specific-star formation rate, and stellar mass as reported in previous studies.
The short $t_{\rm dep}$ partly reflects the starburst nature of the target,
likely to be induced by a major-merger event. B14-65666 can be an ancestor of a
passive galaxy at $z\gtrsim4$ if no gas is fueled from outside the galaxy.
Overall, our observations highlight difficulty in obtaining robust conclusion
from mid-$J$ CO alone particularly in the epoch of reionization, and motivate
studies that use other tracers as an alternative gas mass tracer.

extracts more spectra than the current PYSEDM pipeline. Using SNID
classification results, the new modules show an improvement in the

strength of the cross-correlation remains the same. Improvements to the SEDM

understand hydro-dynamical back-flows and their role in dynamics and
non-thermal emission signatures (in presence of radiative losses and diffusive
shock acceleration) during the initial phase of these galaxies. We have
performed relativistic MHD simulations of an under-dense jet travelling in a
tri-axial ambient using a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to incorporate
effects of micro-physical processes. We have demonstrated the dominant role
played by pressure gradient in shaping XRGs in thermally dominated cases. We
show that the prominence of the formed structure decreases as the jet deviates
from the major axis of the ambient. The wing evolution is mainly governed by
re-energized particles due to shocks that keep the structure active during the
evolution time. The synthetic intensity maps of the radio galaxy show
similarities with morphologies that are typically found in observed XRGs. This
includes the cases with wider wings than the active lobes. The characteristic
emission signatures in terms of its synchrotron spectra and implication of
equipartition condition in age estimation are also discussed here.
Additionally, we show that discrepancy of age can be attributed to mixing of
different aged particle populations. Further, the effect of viewing angle on
the difference of spectral index of the active lobes and the wings $(\Delta
\alpha)$ shows a large variation and degenerate behaviour. We have demonstrated
the role of diffusive shocks in the obtained variation and have concluded that
the spread of $(\Delta \alpha)$ is not a dependable characteristic in
determining the formation model of XRGs.

MHz, low-frequency Murchison Widefield Array radio spectrum and its faintness
in K-band. Follow-up spectroscopic observations of this source with the VLA and

arcsec away. The G102 grism observations reveal a single weak line in each of
the spectra of the host and the companion. To help identify these lines we
utilised several photometric redshift techniques including template fitting to
the grism spectra, fitting the UV-to-radio photometry with galaxy templates
plus a synchrotron model, fitting of the UV-to-near-infrared photometry with
EAZY, and fitting the radio data alone with RAiSERed. For the host of GLEAM
J0917-0012 we find a line at 1.12 micron and the UV-to-radio spectral energy
distribution fitting favours solutions at z~2 or z~8. While this fitting shows
a weak preference for the lower redshift solution, the models from the higher
redshift solution are more consistent with the strength of the spectral line.
The redshift constraint by RAiSERed of z>6.5 also supports the interpretation
that this line could be Lyman-alpha at z=8.21; however EAZY favours the z~2
solution. We discuss the implications of both solutions. For the companion
galaxy we find a line at 0.98 micron and the spectral energy distribution
fitting favours solutions at z<3 implying that the line could be the [OII]3727

not know whether partisanship drives exposure to misinformation or people
selectively share misinformation despite being exposed to factual content. We

ideologically along political and factual dimensions. We find partisan
asymmetries in both sharing behaviors and exposure, with conservatives more
likely to see and share misinformation and moderate liberals seeing the most
factual content. We identify multi-dimensional echo chambers that expose users
to ideologically congruent content; however, the interaction between political
and factual dimensions creates conditions for the highly polarized users --
hardline conservatives and liberals -- to amplify misinformation. Despite this,
misinformation receives less attention than factual content and political
moderates, who represent the bulk of users in our sample, help filter out
misinformation, reducing the amount of low factuality content in the
information ecosystem. Identifying the extent of polarization and how political
ideology can exacerbate misinformation can potentially help public health

morphological and statistical studies of polarised structures in the

produced a 3100 square degree Faraday tomographic cube using a rotation measure

compared them with data sets at higher frequencies (1.4 GHz) and with a map of
a rotation measure derived from extragalactic sources. The mosaic is dominated
by polarised emission connected to Loop III. Additionally, the mosaic reveals
an abundance of other morphological structures, mainly {narrow and extended}
depolarisation canals, which are found to be ubiquitous. We find a correlation
between the map of an extragalactic rotation measure and the LoTSS first

calibrated to the electronic band structures calculated via density functional

algorithm. The results show that a machine-learned five-band tight-binding

the contribution of the $3s$ orbital of $\rm Mg$ to the conduction bands and
the outer shell $p$ orbitals of $\rm X~(X=Si,Ge,Sn,Pb)$ to the valence bands.
In contrast, tensile strain has a reversed effect as it weakens the
contribution of the $3s$ orbital of $\rm Mg$ and the outer shell $p$ orbitals
of $\rm X$ to the conduction bands and valence bands, respectively. The $\pi$
bonding in the $\rm Mg_2X$ compounds is negligible compared to the $\sigma$
bonding components, which follow the hierarchy
$|\sigma_{sp}|>|\sigma_{pp}|>|\sigma_{ss}|$, and the largest variation against
strain belongs to $\sigma_{pp}$. The five-band model allows for estimating the
strength of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in $\rm Mg_2X$ and obtaining its
dependence on the atomic number of $\rm X$ and strain. Further, the band
structure calculations demonstrate a significant band gap tuning and band
splitting due to strain. A compressive strain of $-10\%$ can open a band gap at
the $\Gamma$ point in metallic $\rm Mg_2Pb$, whereas a tensile strain of
$+10\%$ closes the semiconducting band gap of $\rm Mg_2Si$. A tensile strain of

truncated, decelerating bicone model explains well the kinematics of the

driven by the interaction between the ISM in the disk and the highly inclined

strongly favor the ""CO dissociation scenario"" rather than the ""in-situ C

morphology measures (Asymmetry, Smoothness and Gini), and compare these
measurements with those extracted from idealised galaxy simulations. We show
that the morphology of the molecular ISM changes systematically as a function
of various large-scale galaxy parameters, including galaxy morphological type,
stellar mass, stellar velocity dispersion, effective stellar mass surface
density, molecular gas surface density, star formation efficiency and the
presence of a bar. We perform a statistical analysis to determine which of
these correlated parameters best predicts the morphology of the ISM. We find
the effective stellar mass surface (or volume) density to be the strongest
predictor of the morphology of the molecular gas, while star formation and bars
maybe be important secondary drivers. We find that gas self-gravity is not the
dominant process shaping the morphology of the molecular gas in galaxy centres.
Instead effects caused by the depth of the potential well such as shear,
suppression of stellar spiral density waves and/or inflow affect the ability of
the gas to fragment.

constraints of the object HR 6819. The system could consist of a close inner
B-type giant plus a black hole (BH) binary with an additional Be companion in a
wide orbit. Alternatively, it could be a binary composed of a stripped B star
and a Be star in a close orbit. Either scenario makes HR 6819 a cornerstone
object as the stellar BH closest to Earth, or as an example of an important
transitional, non-equilibrium phase for Be stars with solid evidence for its
nature. We aimed to distinguish between the two scenarios for HR 6819. Both
models predict two luminous stars but with very different angular separations
and orbital motions. Therefore, the presence of bright sources in the 1-100
milliarcsec (mas) regime is a key diagnostic for determining the nature of the
HR 6819 system. We obtained new high-angular resolution data with VLT/MUSE and
VLTI/GRAVITY of HR 6819. The MUSE data are sensitive to bright companions at
large scales, whilst the interferometric GRAVITY data are sensitive down to
separations on mas scales and large magnitude differences. The MUSE
observations reveal no bright companion at large separations and the GRAVITY
observations indicate the presence of a stellar companion at an angular
separation of ~1.2 mas that moves on the plane of the sky over a timescale
compatible with the known spectroscopic 40-day period. We conclude that HR 6819
is a binary system and that no BH is present in the system. The unique nature
of HR 6819, and its proximity to Earth make it an ideal system for
quantitatively characterising the immediate outcome of binary interaction and
probing how Be stars form.

work proposes Neural Galerkin schemes based on deep learning that generate
training data samples with active learning for numerically solving

networks by minimizing the residual sequentially over time, which enables
adaptively collecting new training data in a self-informed manner that is
guided by the dynamics described by the partial differential equations, which
is in stark contrast to many other machine learning methods that aim to fit
network parameters globally in time without taking into account training data
acquisition. Our finding is that the active form of gathering training data of
the proposed Neural Galerkin schemes is key for numerically realizing the
expressive power of networks in high dimensions. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that Neural Galerkin schemes have the potential to enable
simulating phenomena and processes with many variables for which traditional

damping of poorly damped inter-area modes in large power systems. This involves
the use of wide-area feedback signals, which are transmitted via communication
networks. The performance of the closed-loop system is strongly influenced by
the delay associated with wide-area signals. The random nature of this delay
introduces a switched linear system model. The stability assessment of such a
system requires linear matrix inequality based approaches. This makes the
stability analysis more complicated as the system size increases. To address
this challenge, this paper proposes a delay-processing strategy that simplifies
the modelling and analysis in discrete-domain. In contrast to the existing
stability assessment techniques, the proposed approach is advantageous because
the stability, as well as damping performance, can be accurately predicted by a
simplified analysis. The proposed methodology is verified with a case study on
the 2-area 4-machine power system with a series compensated tie-line. The
results are found to be in accordance with the predictions of the proposed

synthetic data has been shown to have limited utility when used to train
predictive models. One promising potential application of these data is in the
exploratory phase of the machine learning workflow, which involves
understanding, engineering and selecting features. This phase often involves
considerable time, and depends on the availability of data. There would be
substantial value in synthetic data that permitted these steps to be carried
out while, for example, data access was being negotiated, or with fewer

of the agreement between the feature importance obtained from raw and from
synthetic data, on a range of artificially generated and real-world datasets
(where feature importance represents how useful each feature is when predicting
a the outcome). We employ two differentially-private methods to produce
synthetic data, and apply various utility measures to quantify the agreement in
feature importance as this varies with the level of privacy. Our results
indicate that synthetic data can sometimes preserve several representations of
the ranking of feature importance in simple settings but their performance is
not consistent and depends upon a number of factors. Particular caution should
be exercised in more nuanced real-world settings, where synthetic data can lead
to differences in ranked feature importance that could alter key modelling

observed to descend through the solar corona, mostly in EUV and soft X-ray

voided (subdense) bubbles and are related to magnetic reconnection processes
during long-term erupting flares. In this work we use numerical MHD simulations
to compute flux density maps, which are convolved with telescope beams to
synthesise images with the aim to assess the expected SADs emission at radio
wavelengths and propose observing strategies, including the instruments that
can be used. We assume that the emission is thermal bremsstrahlung from a fully
ionised plasma without any appreciable gyroresonance contribution since
magnetic fields are of the order of ~10 G. We find that SADs emission should be
optically thin in the frequency [10-1000] GHz range, and the spatially
integrated flux should be larger than 1 Jy. We conclude, therefore, that
observing SADs in radio frequencies between [0.5-1000] GHz is feasible with
present instrumentation. Moreover, since the emission is for the most part
optically thin, the flux density is proportional to temperature, density and
line-of-sight depth, and when combined with EUV and soft X-ray images, may
allow a better density and temperature determination of SADs.

that dense obstacles both necessitate large graphs (to guarantee completeness)

To address this, we develop a planning framework with two parts: one that
maximizes planner completeness for a given graph size, and a second that
dynamically maximizes graph size subject to computational constraints. This
framework is enabled by motion planning graphs that are defined by a single
parameter, dispersion, which quantifies the maximum trajectory cost to reach an
arbitrary state from the graph. We show through real and simulated experiments
how the dispersion can be adapted to different environments in realtime,
allowing operation in environments with varying density. The simulated
experiment demonstrates improved performance over a baseline search-based
planning algorithm. We also demonstrate flight speeds of up to 2.5m/s in

atlas of the spectral evolution of RS Oph during the 2021 nova outburst. Some
quick conclusions that can be drawn are: (1) the spectra evolution has
progressed smoothly, suggesting that both the expansion of the ejecta through
the pre-existing RG wind and the photo-ionization from the central source did
not encountered sudden discontinuities prior to switch-off of the nuclear
burning; (2) the 2021 spectral evolution is similar to that of the 2006
eruption, with a mirror-appearance of the triple-peaked line profiles (blue
peak brighter than red in 2006, the opposite in 2021); (3) the evolution of the
triple-peaked profiles progressed similarly through different excitation and
ionization degrees, suggesting an origin in a bipolar outflow nested to an
equatorial torus; (4) the time-behavior of coronal emission lines appears quite
smooth, both in terms of radiated flux as well as evolution of the
triple-peaked profiles, with a plateau at maximum lasting up to about day 87;
(5) there seems to exist within RS Oph two distinct types of ejecta: one fast
moving and producing Gaussian-like line profiles (primarely [NII] and [OIII]),
that keep expanding at FWHM=1000 km/s with no sign of ongoing deceleration
during the two months leading up to Solar conjunction, and slower moving ejecta
giving rise to the triple-peaked line profiles (HeI, HeII, coronal lines, and
also Balmer lines at later times), for which the separation in velocity of blue
and red peaks is still shrinking at the time of Solar conjunction when it
reaches an average of 330 km/s; (6) the ""symbiotic band"" at 6825 Ang, due to
Raman scattering of OVI 1032 by neutral hydrogen, appears simultaneously with
the coronal lines: its very presence indicates that a sizeable part of the wind
of the red giant has remained neutral during the development of coronal lines.

of low-energy quasilocalized (nonphononic) excitations whose frequencies
$\omega$ follow a universal $\sim\!\omega^4$ distribution as $\omega\!\to\!0$,
independently of the glass formation history, the interparticle interaction

nonphononic excitations also holds in disordered crystals featuring finite
long-range order, which is absent in their glassy counterparts. We thus
establish that the degree of universality of the quartic law extends beyond

more quasilocalized excitations than expected based on their degree of

price levels $p_1 > p_2 > \cdots > p_{k}$ for the auction clock such that
auction expected revenue is maximized. The prices levels are announced prior to
the auction. We reduce this problem to a new variant of prophet inequality,
which we call \emph{batched prophet inequality}, where a decision-maker chooses
$k$ (decreasing) thresholds and then sequentially collects rewards (up to $m$)
that are above the thresholds with ties broken uniformly at random. For the
special case of $m=1$ (i.e., selling a single item), we show that the resulting
descending auction with $k$ price levels achieves $1- 1/e^k$ of the
unrestricted (without the bound of $k$) optimal revenue. That means a
descending auction with just 4 price levels can achieve more than 98\% of the

important challenges in Particle Physics. The shape of the endpoint region of
$\beta$-decay and electron capture (EC) spectra depends on the phase space
factor, which, in turn, is function of the neutrino mass eigenstates. High
energy resolution and high statistics measurements of $\beta$- and EC spectra
are therefore considered a model-independent way for the determination of the
neutrino mass scale. Since almost four decades, low temperature
microcalorimeters are used for the measurement of low energy $\beta$- and EC
spectra. The first efforts were focused on the development of large arrays for
the measurement of the $^{187}$Re $\beta$-spectrum. In the last ten years, the
attention moved to EC of $^{163}$Ho. This choice was mainly motivated by the
very good performance which could be achieved with low temperature
microcalorimeters enclosing $^{163}$Ho with respect to microcalorimeters with
absorber containing $^{187}$Re. The development of low temperature
microcalorimeters for the measurement of the finite neutrino mass is discussed

possibility to reach sub-eV sensitivity on the effective electron neutrino mass
with $^{163}$Ho, thanks to the multiplexing of large microcalorimeter arrays is
demonstrated. In conclusion, an overview on other nuclides which have been

can provide a mechanism for the generation of lepton asymmetry and hence baryon
asymmetry, through CP violating Higgs decays, near weak scale temperatures. In
another model with only one extra Higgs doublet, we illustrate that Yukawa
couplings to quarks and neutrinos can lead to a viable mechanism for the
generation of Dirac neutrino masses, sourced by the QCD chiral condensate of
strange quarks. We adapt Spontaneous Flavor Violation -- a framework for
coupling light fermions to new Higgs doublets while avoiding tree level
flavor-changing neutral currents -- in constructing these models. In both
cases, flavor data provide interesting constraints on the parameter space.
Either scenario includes $\mathcal{O}{(1)}$ couplings of light quarks to the
Higgs doublets which allow a future 100 TeV $pp$ collider to have reach for the
new scalars up to $\mathcal{O}{(10~{\rm TeV})}$ masses, through resonant single
production. In the neutrino mass model, collider data can shed light on the

memoryless channels and the Gaussian channel with a maximal power constraint.
The third-order term in our expansions employs a new quantity here called the
\emph{channel skewness}, which affects the approximation accuracy more
significantly as the error probability decreases. For the Gaussian channel,
evaluating Shannon's (1959) random coding and sphere-packing bounds in the
central limit theorem (CLT) regime enables exact computation of the channel
skewness. For discrete memoryless channels, this work generalizes Moulin's
(2017) bounds on the asymptotic expansion of the maximum achievable message set
size for nonsingular channels from the CLT regime to include the moderate
deviations (MD) regime, thereby refining Altu\u{g} and Wagner's (2014) MD
result. For an example binary symmetric channel and most practically important
$(n, \epsilon)$ pairs, including $n \in [100, 500]$ and $\epsilon \in
[10^{-10}, 10^{-1}]$, an approximation up to the channel skewness is the most
accurate among several expansions in the literature. A derivation of the
third-order term in the type-II error exponent of binary hypothesis testing in
the MD regime is also included; the resulting third-order term is similar to
the channel skewness.

absolutely general and can be carried out for any polynomial with simple zeros

quasi-orthogonality of $P$ with respect to $w$ allows us to give more precise

generalize others. Additionally, for the Hermite--Pad\'e or multiple orthogonal

their zeros in terms of a vector equilibrium. More detailed results are
obtained in the special cases of Angelesco, Nikishin, and generalized Nikishin

popular version of this. We give an analysis of the behaviour of minimax rules

rules avoids the need to determine probabilities for each scenario, which is an
attractive feature in many public sector settings. However, minimax rules will
have sensitivity to the choice of scenarios. In many cases using a minimax
approach will mean the requirement for what may be regarded as arbitrary
probabilities on scenarios is replaced by a similarly arbitrary choice of a
very small number of specific scenarios. We investigate this phenomenon. When
regret-based rules are used there are also problems arising since the
independence of irrelevant alternatives property fails, which can lead to
opportunities to game the process. Our analysis of these phenomena considers
cases where the decision variables are chosen from a convex set in $R^n$, as

needed. To address this challenge, we explore the trade-offs between
addressable assembly and self-closing assembly of a specific class of
self-limiting structures: cylindrical tubules. We make triangular subunits
using DNA origami that have specific, valence-limited interactions and designed
binding angles, and study their assembly into tubules that have a self-limited
width that is much larger than the size of an individual subunit. In the
simplest case, the tubules are assembled from a single component by
geometrically programming the dihedral angles between neighboring subunits. We
show that the tubules can reach many micrometers in length and that their
average width can be prescribed through the dihedral angles. We find that there
is a distribution in the width and the chirality of the tubules, which we
rationalize by developing a model that considers the finite bending rigidity of
the assembled structure as well as the mechanism of self-closure. Finally, we
demonstrate that the distributions of tubules can be further sculpted by
increasing the number of subunit species, thereby increasing the assembly
complexity, and demonstrate that using two subunit species successfully reduces
the number of available end states by half. These results help to shed light on
the roles of assembly complexity and geometry in self-limited assembly and
could be extended to other self-limiting architectures, such as shells,

especially when treatment information is missing. Although this is a widespread
problem in practice, CATE estimation with missing treatments has received
little attention. In this paper, we analyze CATE estimation in the setting with
missing treatments where unique challenges arise in the form of covariate
shifts. We identify two covariate shifts in our setting: (i) a covariate shift
between the treated and control population; and (ii) a covariate shift between
the observed and missing treatment population. We first theoretically show the
effect of these covariate shifts by deriving a generalization bound for
estimating CATE in our setting with missing treatments. Then, motivated by our
bound, we develop the missing treatment representation network (MTRNet), a
novel CATE estimation algorithm that learns a balanced representation of
covariates using domain adaptation. By using balanced representations, MTRNet
provides more reliable CATE estimates in the covariate domains where the data
are not fully observed. In various experiments with semi-synthetic and

When it is mixed with amorphous solid water (ASW) or located on its surface, an
absorption band of CO at 2152 cm$^{-1}$ is always present in laboratory
measurements. This spectral feature is attributed to the interaction of CO with
dangling-OH bonds (dOH) in ASW. However, this band is absent in observational
spectra of interstellar ices. This raises the question whether CO forms a
relatively pure layer on top of ASW or is in close contact with ASW, but not
via dangling bonds. We aim to determine whether the incorporation of NH$_3$ or
CO$_2$ into ASW blocks the dOH and therefore reduces the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band.
We performed laboratory experiments to simulate the layered structure of the
ice mantle, that is, we grew CO ice on top of 1) pure ASW, 2)
NH$_3$:H$_2$O=10:100 mixed ice, and 3) CO$_2$:H$_2$O=20:100 mixed ice. Infrared
spectra were measured to quantify the strength of the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band. In
addition, a second set of experiments were performed to determine how the
incorporation of NH$_3$ into ASW affects the dOH band. We found that annealing
the ice reduces the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band and that NH$_3$ blocks the dOH on ASW
surface and therefore reduces the 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band more effectively than
CO$_2$. We suggest that this difference between NH$_3$ and CO$_2$ can be
ascribed to the polarity of the guest molecule (NH$_3$ is a polar species,
whereas CO$_2$ is apolar). The polarity implies that the formation of an H-bond
between the N atom of ammonia and the dOH is a barrier-less reaction. We also
determined the pore surface area of the ice mixtures as a function of the
annealing temperature, and found that the nondetection of 2152 cm$^{-1}$ band
does not necessarily exclude the possibility of a porous ice mantle.

systems, from the standard model to topological quantum matter, the realization
of chiral QFTs on a lattice has proved to be difficult due to the
Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem and the possible presence of quantum anomalies. In
this thesis, we use the connection between chiral phases of matter and chiral
quantum field theories (QFTs) to define chiral QFTs on a lattice and allow a
huge class of exotic field theories to be simulated numerically. Our work
builds on the 'mirror fermion' approach to the problem of defining chiral
theories on a lattice, which defines chiral field theories as the edge modes of
chiral phases. We begin by reviewing the deep connections between chiral phases
of matter, chiral field theories, and anomalies. We then develop numerical
treatments of an $SU(2)$ chiral field theory, and provide a semiclassically
solvable definition of Abelian $2+1$ chiral topological orders. This leads to
an exactly solvable definition of chiral $U(1)$ SPT phases with zero
correlation length, which we use to extract the edge chiral field theories
exactly. These zero-correlation length models are vastly more simple than
previous approaches to defining chiral field theories on the lattice.

are often used to quantify the relative predictive performance of two rival
hypotheses. The computation of Bayes factors can be challenging, however, and
this has contributed to the popularity of convenient approximations such as the
BIC. Unfortunately, these approximations can fail in the case of informed prior
distributions. Here we address this problem by outlining an approximation to
informed Bayes factors for a focal parameter $\theta$. The approximation is
computationally simple and requires only the maximum likelihood estimate
$\hat\theta$ and its standard error. The approximation uses an estimated
likelihood of $\theta$ and assumes that the posterior distribution for $\theta$
is unaffected by the choice of prior distribution for the nuisance parameters.
The resulting Bayes factor for the null hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_0: \theta =
\theta_0$ versus the alternative hypothesis $\mathcal{H}_1: \theta \sim
g(\theta)$ is then easily obtained using the Savage--Dickey density ratio.
Three real-data examples highlight the speed and closeness of the approximation
compared to bridge sampling and Laplace's method. The proposed approximation
facilitates Bayesian reanalyses of standard frequentist results, encourages
application of Bayesian tests with informed priors, and alleviates the
computational challenges that often frustrate both Bayesian sensitivity
analyses and Bayes factor design analyses. The approximation is shown to suffer
under small sample sizes and when the posterior distribution of the focal
parameter is substantially influenced by the prior distributions on the
nuisance parameters. The proposed methodology may also be used to approximate
the posterior distribution for $\theta$ under $\mathcal{H}_1$.

lightweight, accurate, and predictable occupancy representation for automotive
radars working for short-range applications that take interest in instantaneous
free space surrounding the sensor. This new occupancy format is a polygon
composed of a bunch of vertices selected from noisy radar measurements, which
covers free space inside and gives a Doppler moving velocity for each vertex.
It not only takes a very small memory and computing resources for storage and
updating at every timeslot but also has the predictable shape-change property
based on vertex's Doppler velocity. We name this kind of occupancy
representation 'deformable radar polygon'. Two formation algorithms for radar
polygon are introduced for both single timeslot and continuous inverse sensor
model update. To fit this new polygon representation, a matrix-form collision
detection method has been modeled as well. The radar polygon algorithms and
collision detection model have been validated via extensive experiments with

that a task-specific linear classifier is obtained as a solution of an ordinary
differential equation (ODE). Treating the learning process as an ODE offers the
notable advantage that the length of the trajectory is now continuous, as
opposed to a fixed and discrete number of gradient steps. As a consequence, we
can optimize the amount of adaptation necessary to solve a new task using
stochastic gradient descent, in addition to learning the initial conditions as
is standard practice in gradient-based meta-learning. Importantly, in order to
compute the exact meta-gradients required for the outer-loop updates, we devise
an efficient algorithm based on forward mode differentiation, whose memory
requirements do not scale with the length of the learning trajectory, thus
allowing longer adaptation in constant memory. We provide analytical guarantees

consider features of each modality equally. In this study, self-attention as an

policies is known to be quickly intractable even for systems of modest

challenge, we present a scalable alternative called stochastic parametric
differentiable predictive control (SP-DPC) for unsupervised learning of neural
control policies governing stochastic linear systems subject to nonlinear
chance constraints. SP-DPC is formulated as a deterministic approximation to
the stochastic parametric constrained optimal control problem. This formulation
allows us to directly compute the policy gradients via automatic
differentiation of the problem's value function, evaluated over sampled
parameters and uncertainties. In particular, the computed expectation of the
SP-DPC problem's value function is backpropagated through the closed-loop
system rollouts parametrized by a known nominal system dynamics model and
neural control policy which allows for direct model-based policy optimization.
We provide theoretical probabilistic guarantees for policies learned via the
SP-DPC method on closed-loop stability and chance constraints satisfaction.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the
proposed policy optimization algorithm in three numerical examples, including
systems with a large number of states or subject to nonlinear constraints.

Fermi-LAT source as a new FRII radio galaxy from the INTEGRAL sample found to
emit at GeV energies. Through a broad-band spectral fitting from radio to
$\gamma$-ray, we find that the commonly invoked jet contribution is not
sufficient to account for the observed $\gamma$-ray flux. Our modeling suggests
that the observed emission could mainly originate in the lobes (rather than in
the radio core) by inverse Compton scattering of radio-emitting electrons off
the ambient photon fields. In addition, we cross-correlated the latest
generation radio surveys with a list of Fermi-LAT objects from the literature
considered to be candidate misaligned AGN, finding four new radio galaxies with
a double-lobed morphology. Additional four objects could be classified as such
thanks to previous studies in the literature, for a total of nine new radio

However, some recent work demonstrated that vFL is vulnerable to privacy

highly sensitive information, some recent work has been proposed to prevent the

pass through a wide domain wall with no reflection, here we show that, based on
the discrete spin Hamiltonian, spin waves are generally reflected by a domain
wall with a reflection coefficient that increases as the domain-wall width
decreases. Remarkably, we find that, in the interesting case of an atomically
sharp domain wall, the reflection of spin waves exhibits strong dependence on
the state of circular polarization of the spin waves, leading to mainly
reflection for one polarization while permitting partial transmission for the
other, thus realizing an atomic-scale spin-wave polarizer. The polarization of
the transmitted spin wave depends on the orientation of the spin in the sharp
domain wall, which can be controlled by an external field or spin torque. Our
utilization of a sharp antiferromagnetic domain wall as an atomic-scale

algorithmic accountability is the question of who should have access to

anticipated consequences of algorithmic systems, potentially establishing new
routes for impacted publics to contest the operations of these systems.
Currently, developers largely have a monopoly on information about how their
systems actually work and are incentivized to maintain their own ignorance
about aspects of how their systems affect the world. Increasingly, legislators,
regulators and advocates have turned to assessment documentation in order to
address the gap between the public's experience of algorithmic harms and the
obligations of developers to document and justify their design decisions.
However, issues of standing and expertise currently prevent publics from
cohering around shared interests in preventing and redressing algorithmic
harms; as we demonstrate with multiple cases, courts often find computational
harms non-cognizable and rarely require developers to address material claims
of harm. Constructed with a triadic accountability relationship, algorithmic
impact assessment regimes could alter this situation by establishing procedural
rights around public access to reporting and documentation. Developing a
relational approach to accountability, we argue that robust accountability
regimes must establish opportunities for publics to cohere around shared
experiences and interests, and to contest the outcomes of algorithmic systems
that affect their lives. Furthermore, algorithmic accountability policies
currently under consideration in many jurisdictions must provide the public
with adequate standing and opportunities to access and contest the

that the effect of the spatially-varying m-bias may be a sub-dominant but
potentially non-negligible contribution to the error budget in forthcoming weak
lensing surveys. We also investigate the dependence of parameter biases on the
amplitude and angular scale of spatial variations of the m-bias field, and
conclude that requirements should be placed on the rms of spatial variations of

The HST observations show signs of water absorption indicative of a
non-inverted thermal structure. We fit the data with both a one-dimensional
free retrieval and a grid of one-dimensional self-consistent forward models to
confirm this non-inverted structure. The free retrieval places a $3\sigma$
lower limit on the atmospheric water abundance of $\log(n_\mathrm{H_2O})>-4.78$
and can not constrain the CO abundance. The grid fit produces a slightly
super-stellar metallicity and constrains the carbon-to-oxygen ratio to less

high-resolution observations of WASP-77Ab taken with the Gemini-South/IGRINS
spectrograph and find that our observations are consistent with the best-fit
model to the high-resolution data. However, the metallicity derived from the

learning context-dependent tasks and has also attracted attention as a method
with remarkable learning performance in recent research. However, RNN-based RL
has some issues that the learning procedures tend to be more computationally
expensive, and training with backpropagation through time (BPTT) is unstable
because of vanishing/exploding gradients problem. An approach with replay
memory introducing reservoir computing has been proposed, which trains an agent
without BPTT and avoids these issues. The basic idea of this approach is that
observations from the environment are input to the reservoir network, and both
the observation and the reservoir output are stored in the memory. This paper
shows that the performance of this method improves by using a multi-layered
neural network for the readout layer, which regularly consists of a single
linear layer. The experimental results show that using multi-layered readout
improves the learning performance of four classical control tasks that require
time-series processing.

the use of symmetries and the Gray code reduces the quantum resources and

Our insight is replacing the last black-box FSL classifier of the existing
representation learning methods by an interpretable decision tree with
meta-learning. The key challenge is how to effectively learn the decision tree
(i.e., the tree structure and the parameters of each node) in the FSL setting.
To address the challenge, we introduce a tree-like class hierarchy as our
prior: 1) the hierarchy is directly employed as the tree structure; 2) by
regarding the class hierarchy as an undirected graph, a graph convolution-based
decision tree inference network is designed as our meta-learner to learn to
infer the parameters of each node. At last, a two-loop optimization mechanism
is incorporated into our framework for a fast adaptation of the decision tree
with few examples. Extensive experiments on performance comparison and

recruitment and release of actin filaments into and out of the cell cortex - a
network of proteins underneath the cell membrane - leads to cell stiffening
prior to division and softening immediately afterward. In three-dimensional
(3D) cell collectives, it is unclear whether the stiffness change during
division at the single-cell scale controls the spatial structure and dynamics
at the multicellular scale. This is an important question to understand as cell
stiffness variations play an important role in tissue spatial organization and
cancer progression. Using a minimal 3D model incorporating cell birth, death,
and cell-to-cell elastic and adhesive interactions, we investigate the effect
of mechanical heterogeneity - variations in individual cell stiffnesses that
make up the tumor cell collective - on tumor spatial organization and cell
dynamics. We discover that spatial mechanical heterogeneity characterized by a
spheroid core composed of stiffer cells and softer cells in the periphery
emerge within dense 3D cell collectives, which may be a general feature of
multicellular tumor growth. We show that heightened spatial mechanical
heterogeneity enhances single-cell dynamics and volumetric tumor growth driven

SinGAN which builds a pyramid of GANs to progressively learn the internal patch

range of image manipulation tasks. However, the paradigm of SinGAN has
limitations in terms of generation quality and training time. Firstly, due to
the lack of high-level information, SinGAN cannot handle the object images well
as it does on the scene and texture images. Secondly, the separate progressive
training scheme is time-consuming and easy to cause artifact accumulation. To
tackle these problems, in this paper, we dig into the SIG problem and improve
SinGAN by fully-utilization of internal and external priors. The main
contributions of this paper include: 1) We introduce to SIG a regularized
latent variable model. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to
give a clear formulation and optimization goal of SIG, and all the existing
methods for SIG can be regarded as special cases of this model. 2) We design a
novel Prior-based end-to-end training GAN (PetsGAN) to overcome the problems of
SinGAN. Our method gets rid of the time-consuming progressive training scheme
and can be trained end-to-end. 3) We construct abundant qualitative and
quantitative experiments to show the superiority of our method on both

realize the fast computation of multiple problems. One remarkable feature of
the algorithm is that multiple linear systems share a common coefficient matrix
in each deterministic numerical model, which significantly reduces the
computational cost and achieves comparable accuracy with the traditional
methods. Moreover, by domain decomposition, we can decouple the Stokes-Darcy
system into two smaller sub-physics problems naturally. Both mesh-dependent and
mesh-independent convergence rates of the algorithm are rigorously derived by
choosing suitable Robin parameters. Optimized Robin parameters are derived and
analyzed to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Especially,
for small hydraulic conductivity in practice, the almost optimal geometric
convergence can be obtained by finite element discretization. Finally, two
groups of numerical experiments are conducted to validate and illustrate the

monoxide is one of the most abundant molecules, its surface diffusion on the
grain surface is essential to forming many molecules. Recent laboratory
experiments found a diverse range of diffusion barriers for CO on the grain
surface, their use can significantly impact the abundance of several molecules.
The impact of different diffusion barriers of CO, in the astrochemical models,
is studied to understand its effect on the abundance of solid CO and the
species for which it is a reactant partner. A gas-grain network is used for
three different physical conditions; cold-core and warm-up models with slow and
fast heating rates. Two different ratios (0.3 and 0.5) between diffusion and
desorption barrier are utilized for all the species. For each physical
condition and ratio, six different models are run by varying diffusion barriers
of CO. Solid CO abundance for the models with the lowest diffusion barrier

slow and fast warm-up models. Also, solid CO$_2$ in dense clouds is
significantly overproduced (140 % of water). The abundance of H$_2$CO and
CH$_3$OH showed an opposite trend, and HCOOH, CH$_3$CHO, NH$_2$CO, and
CH$_3$COCH$_3$ are produced in lower quantities for models with low diffusion
barriers for CO. Considerable variation in abundance is observed between models

provide a relatively better agreement with the observed abundances when

measures for classification models in machine learning. However, it summarizes
the true positive rates (TPRs) over all false positive rates (FPRs) in the ROC
space, which may include the FPRs with no practical relevance in some
applications. The partial AUC, as a generalization of the AUC, summarizes only
the TPRs over a specific range of the FPRs and is thus a more suitable
performance measure in many real-world situations. Although partial AUC
optimization in a range of FPRs had been studied, existing algorithms are not
scalable to big data and not applicable to deep learning. To address this
challenge, we cast the problem into a non-smooth difference-of-convex (DC)
program for any smooth predictive functions (e.g., deep neural networks), which
allowed us to develop an efficient approximated gradient descent method based
on the Moreau envelope smoothing technique, inspired by recent advances in
non-smooth DC optimization. To increase the efficiency of large data
processing, we used an efficient stochastic block coordinate update in our
algorithm. Our proposed algorithm can also be used to minimize the sum of
ranked range loss, which also lacks efficient solvers. We established a
complexity of $\tilde O(1/\epsilon^6)$ for finding a nearly $\epsilon$-critical

proposed algorithms for both partial AUC maximization and sum of ranked range
loss minimization.

incorporates a computationally efficient approximation of the target

performance and reduces the computational cost by replacing the calculation of
the expected target trajectory with a single sample trajectory based on maximum
a posteriori estimation; 2) generates cooperative fleet decision by
sequentially optimizing single-agent policy with efficient usage of other

magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star cluster formation. We find
outflow feedback can change the scaling of velocity fluctuations but still
roughly being in between Kolmogorov and Burgers turbulence. We observe that
self-gravity and protostellar outflows increase the velocity fluctuations over
all length scales. Outflows can amplify the velocity fluctuations by up to a
factor of $\sim$7 on scales $\sim$ 0.01 - 0.2 pc and drive turbulence up to a
scale of $\sim$ 1 pc. The amplified velocity fluctuations provide more support
against gravity and enhance fragmentation on small scales. The self-gravity's
effect is more significant on smaller dense clumps and it increases the
fraction of the compressive velocity component up to a scale of $\sim$ 0.2 pc.
However, outflow feedback drives both solenoidal and compressive modes, but it
induces a higher fraction of solenoidal modes relative to compressive modes.
Thus, with outflows, the dense core ends up with a slightly higher fraction of
solenoidal modes. We find that the compressible fraction is fairly constant
with about 1/3 on scales $\sim$ 0.1 - 0.2 pc. The combined effect of enhanced
velocity dispersion and reduced compressive fraction contributes to a reduction

Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) may learn to rely on
correlations between class labels and spurious attributes, leading to poor
performance on data groups without these correlations. This is particularly
challenging to address when spurious attribute labels are unavailable. To
improve worst-group performance on spuriously correlated data without training
attribute labels, we propose Correct-N-Contrast (CNC), a contrastive approach
to directly learn representations robust to spurious correlations. As ERM
models can be good spurious attribute predictors, CNC works by (1) using a
trained ERM model's outputs to identify samples with the same class but
dissimilar spurious features, and (2) training a robust model with contrastive
learning to learn similar representations for same-class samples. To support
CNC, we introduce new connections between worst-group error and a
representation alignment loss that CNC aims to minimize. We empirically observe
that worst-group error closely tracks with alignment loss, and prove that the
alignment loss over a class helps upper-bound the class's worst-group vs.
average error gap. On popular benchmarks, CNC reduces alignment loss
drastically, and achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy by 3.6% average
absolute lift. CNC is also competitive with oracle methods that require group

supported using a python based user interface. This system can synthesize
arbitrary vector microwave pulses using the second-Nyquist zone technique for

semi-supervised learning and automatic labeling strategies can be an asset for
training deep neural networks. However, the quality of the automatically
generated labels can be uneven and inferior to manual labels. In this paper, we
suggest a semi-supervised training strategy for leveraging both manually
labeled data and extra unlabeled data. In contrast to the existing approaches,
we apply robust loss for the automated labeled data to automatically compensate
for the uneven data quality using a teacher-student framework. First, we
generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data using a teacher model pre-trained on
labeled data. These pseudo-labels are noisy, and using them along with labeled
data for training a deep neural network can severely degrade learned feature
representations and the generalization of the network. Here we mitigate the
effect of these pseudo-labels by using robust loss functions. Specifically, we
use three robust loss functions, namely beta cross-entropy, symmetric
cross-entropy, and generalized cross-entropy. We show that our proposed
strategy improves the model performance by compensating for the uneven quality
of labels in image classification as well as segmentation applications.

densities as a function of the distances between them are measured via

present an assessment procedure of dark matter scenarios. First, we use Gaia's
data to infer the single-body phase-space density of the stars in the Fornax
dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The latter, together with the Jeans equation, after
eliminating the gravitational potential using the Poisson equation, reveals the
mass density of dark matter as a function of its position in the galaxy. We
derive the correlations between dark matter mass densities as a function of
distances between them. No statistically significant correlation is observed.
Second, for the sake of comparison with the standard cold dark matter, we also
compute the correlations between dark matter mass densities in a small halo of
the Eagle hydrodynamics simulation. We show that the correlations from the
simulation and from Gaia are in agreement. Third, we show that Gaia
observations can be used to limit the parameter space of the Ginzburg--Landau
statistical field theory of dark matter mass densities and subsequently shrink
the parameter space of any dark matter model. As two examples, we show how to
leave limitations on (i) a classic gas dark matter and (ii) a superfluid dark

image-based segmentation task, the research on cross-domain segmentation for
very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing images (RSIs) still remains
underexplored. The VHR RSIs-based cross-domain segmentation mainly faces two
critical challenges: 1) Large area land covers with many diverse object
categories bring severe local patch-level data distribution deviations, thus
yielding different adaptation difficulties for different local patches; 2)
Different VHR sensor types or dynamically changing modes cause the VHR images
to go through intensive data distribution differences even for the same
geographical location, resulting in different global feature-level domain gap.
To address these challenges, we propose a curriculum-style local-to-global
cross-domain adaptation framework for the segmentation of VHR RSIs. The
proposed curriculum-style adaptation performs the adaptation process in an
easy-to-hard way according to the adaptation difficulties that can be obtained
using an entropy-based score for each patch of the target domain, and thus well
aligns the local patches in a domain image. The proposed local-to-global
adaptation performs the feature alignment process from the locally semantic to
globally structural feature discrepancies, and consists of a semantic-level
domain classifier and an entropy-level domain classifier that can reduce the
above cross-domain feature discrepancies. Extensive experiments have been
conducted in various cross-domain scenarios, including geographic location
variations and imaging mode variations, and the experimental results

analysis. Most existing works draw inspiration from image object detection and
tend to reformulate it as a proposal generation - classification problem.
However, there are two caveats with this paradigm. First, proposals are not
equipped with annotated labels, which have to be empirically compiled, thus the
information in the annotations is not necessarily precisely employed in the
model training process. Second, there are large variations in the temporal
scale of actions, and neglecting this fact may lead to deficient representation
in the video features. To address these issues and precisely model temporal
action detection, we formulate the task of temporal action detection in a novel
perspective of semantic segmentation. Owing to the 1-dimensional property of
TAD, we are able to convert the coarse-grained detection annotations to
fine-grained semantic segmentation annotations for free. We take advantage of
them to provide precise supervision so as to mitigate the impact induced by the
imprecise proposal labels. We propose an end-to-end framework SegTAD composed

realize ultralow-power energy consumption. However, deep SNNs are not easy to
train due to the excessive firing of spiking neurons in the hidden layers. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel but simple normalization technique
called postsynaptic potential normalization. This normalization removes the
subtraction term from the standard normalization and uses the second raw moment
instead of the variance as the division term. The spike firing can be
controlled, enabling the training to proceed appropriating, by conducting this
simple normalization to the postsynaptic potential. The experimental results
show that SNNs with our normalization outperformed other models using other
normalizations. Furthermore, through the pre-activation residual blocks, the
proposed model can train with more than 100 layers without other special
techniques dedicated to SNNs.

the electrons released by the Geminga PWN. The latest HAWC and HESS
observations exhibit complex features in the TeV gamma-ray spectrum of the
Geminga halo. We first show that the new results cannot be interpreted by the
commonly used simple model, where a single power-law injection spectrum and an
energy index of $\delta=1/3$ for the diffusion coefficient are assumed. We then
propose a two-population electron injection model based on the x-ray
observations of the Geminga PWN, which consists of a population of freshly
accelerated electrons escaping from the PWN through rapid outflows and a
population trapped longer inside the PWN before escaping. The two-population
model interprets the HAWC and HESS data well, and the goodness of fit improves
significantly compared with the single power-law injection model. It also
predicts a different energy dependency of the gamma-ray profile from the single
power-law model, which could be tested by LHAASO in the coming future. We note
that a $\delta$ slightly larger than 1 is needed to fit the HAWC and HESS data
consistently. We also discuss the possible improvements by adopting the

Second, using the characteristics of Antivaxxers' tweets, we develop text

anti-vaccination language, ultimately contributing to an early-warning
mechanism to improve the health of our epistemic environment and bolster (and
not hinder) public health initiatives.

binary classes through the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Extending this
characterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the
pioneering works on multiclass PAC learning in the late 1980s. This work
resolves this problem: we characterize multiclass PAC learnability through the
DS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz
(2014).
  The classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical
risk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case
involves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we
call list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting a
single outcome for a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short menu of
predictions.
  Our second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a
central candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension
was introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the
Natarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as
an open question in several papers since. This work provides a negative answer:
we construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one.
  For the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept
classes and topology (i.e., colorful simplicial complexes). We crucially rely
on a deep and involved construction of hyperbolic pseudo-manifolds by
Januszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. It is interesting that hyperbolicity is directly
related to learning problems that are difficult to solve although no obvious
barriers exist. This is another demonstration of the fruitful links machine
learning has with different areas in mathematics.

summaries are essentially unstructured dialogue states; hence, we propose to
reformulate dialogue state tracking as a dialogue summarization problem. To
elaborate, we train a text-to-text language model with synthetic template-based
dialogue summaries, generated by a set of rules from the dialogue states. Then,
the dialogue states can be recovered by inversely applying the summary
generation rules. We empirically show that our method DS2 outperforms previous
works on few-shot DST in MultiWoZ 2.0 and 2.1, in both cross-domain and
multi-domain settings. Our method also exhibits vast speedup during both
training and inference as it can generate all states at once. Finally, based on
our analysis, we discover that the naturalness of the summary templates plays a
key role for successful training.

via solar wind properties. Understanding such a relation in the Solar System is
important for predicting also the condition of exoplanetary magnetospheres near
Sun-like stars. We use measurements of a chromospheric proxy, the Ca II K
index, and solar wind OMNI parameters to connect the solar activity variations,
on the decennial time scales, to the solar wind properties. The data span over
the time interval 1965-2021, which almost entirely covers the last 5 solar
cycles. Using both cross-correlation and mutual information analysis, a
3.2-year lag of the solar wind speed with respect to the Ca II K index is
found. Analogously, a 3.6-year lag is found once considering the dynamic
pressure. A correlation between the solar wind dynamic pressure and the solar
UV emission is found and used to derive the Earth's magnetopause standoff
distance. Moreover, the advantage of using a chromospheric proxy, such as the
Ca II K index, opens the possibility to extend the relation found for the Sun
to Sun-like stars, by linking stellar variability to stellar wind properties.
The model is applied to a sample of Sun-like stars as a case study, where we
assume the presence of an Earth-like exoplanet at 1 AU. Finally, we compare our
results with previous estimates of the magnetosphere extension for the same set
of Sun-like stars.

are asked to develop their AI algorithm that controls a character given only
sound as the input (blind AI) to fight against their opponent; a sample
deep-learning blind AI will be provided by us. Our means to maximize the

this compound is a Dirac nodal line semimetal with symmetry-protected nodal

the gaps of the nodal rings with a small band gap. Furthermore, based on the

involves evaluating each architecture by training it from scratch, which is
extremely time-consuming. This can be reduced by using a supernet to estimate

of the operations in the supernet. In this work, we propose a method called
pEvoNAS wherein the whole neural architecture search space is progressively
reduced to smaller search space regions with good architectures. This is
achieved by using a trained supernet for architecture evaluation during the
architecture search using genetic algorithm to find search space regions with
good architectures. Upon reaching the final reduced search space, the supernet
is then used to search for the best architecture in that search space using
evolution. The search is also enhanced by using weight inheritance wherein the
supernet for the smaller search space inherits its weights from previous
trained supernet for the bigger search space. Exerimentally, pEvoNAS gives
better results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 while using significantly less

spoof attacks for face biometric systems. Many works based on Convolution
Neural Networks (CNNs) for face PAD formulate the problem as an image-level
binary classification task without considering the context. Alternatively,
Vision Transformers (ViT) using self-attention to attend the context of an

Video-based Transformer for face PAD (ViTransPAD) with short/long-range
spatio-temporal attention which can not only focus on local details with short

Instead of using coarse image patches with single-scale as in ViT, we propose
the Multi-scale Multi-Head Self-Attention (MsMHSA) architecture to accommodate
multi-scale patch partitions of Q, K, V feature maps to the heads of
transformer in a coarse-to-fine manner, which enables to learn a fine-grained
representation to perform pixel-level discrimination for face PAD. Due to lack
inductive biases of convolutions in pure transformers, we also introduce
convolutions to the proposed ViTransPAD to integrate the desirable properties
of CNNs by using convolution patch embedding and convolution projection. The
extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed ViTransPAD with a
preferable accuracy-computation balance, which can serve as a new backbone for

information into a downstream task-agnostic dense vector embedding. However,
existing graph representation learning approaches are designed mainly under the
node homophily assumption: connected nodes tend to have similar labels and
optimize performance on node-centric downstream tasks. Their design is
apparently against the task-agnostic principle and generally suffers poor
performance in tasks, e.g., edge classification, that demands feature signals
beyond the node-view and homophily assumption. To condense different feature
signals into the embeddings, this paper proposes PairE, a novel unsupervised
graph embedding method using two paired nodes as the basic unit of embedding to
retain the high-frequency signals between nodes to support node-related and
edge-related tasks. Accordingly, a multi-self-supervised autoencoder is
designed to fulfill two pretext tasks: one retains the high-frequency signal
better, and another enhances the representation of commonality. Our extensive
experiments on a diversity of benchmark datasets clearly show that PairE
outperforms the unsupervised state-of-the-art baselines, with up to 101.1\%
relative improvement on the edge classification tasks that rely on both the

in the concept of multipartite entanglement. In this paper, we consider
well-known measures of multipartite (global) entanglement, i.e., average linear
entropy of one-qubit and two-qubit reduced density matrices, in order to study
topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) in the Kitaev Toric code
Hamiltonian with a nonlinear perturbation. We provide an $exact$ mapping from
aforementioned measures in the above model to internal energy and energy-energy
correlations in the classical Ising model. Accordingly, we find that the global
entanglement shows a continuous and sharp transition from a maximum value in
the topological phase to zero in the magnetized phase in a sense that its
first-order derivative diverges at the transition point. In this regard, we
conclude that not only can the global entanglement serve as a reasonable tool
to probe quantum criticality at TQPTs, but it also can reveal the highly
entangled nature of topological phases. Furthermore, we also introduce a
conditional version of global entanglement which becomes maximum at the
critical point. Therefore, regarding a general expectation that multipartite
entanglement reaches maximum value at the critical point of quantum many-body
systems, our result proposes that the conditional global entanglement can be a
good measure of multipartite entanglement in TQPTs.

estimation, but was rarely studied in the deep learning era. Recent deep
learning-based LF depth estimation methods construct matching cost by
sequentially shifting each sub-aperture image (SAI) with a series of predefined
offsets, which is complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a
simple and fast cost constructor to construct matching cost for LF depth
estimation. Our cost constructor is composed by a series of convolutions with
specifically designed dilation rates. By applying our cost constructor to SAI
arrays, pixels under predefined disparities can be integrated and matching cost
can be constructed without using any shifting operation. More importantly, the
proposed cost constructor is occlusion-aware and can handle occlusions by
dynamically modulating pixels from different views. Based on the proposed cost
constructor, we develop a deep network for LF depth estimation. Our network
ranks first on the commonly used 4D LF benchmark in terms of the mean square
error (MSE), and achieves a faster running time than other state-of-the-art
methods.

function, the surface normal and mean curvature used in the surface
differential expressions can be computed easily. So instead of imposing the
normal extension constraints used in literature, we write the surface
differential operators in the form of traditional Cartesian differential
operators and use them in the loss function directly. We perform a series of
performance study for the present methodology by solving Laplace-Beltrami
equation and surface diffusion equation on complex static surfaces. With just a
moderate number of neurons used in the hidden layer, we are able to attain
satisfactory prediction results. Then we extend the present methodology to
solve the advection-diffusion equation on an evolving surface with given
velocity. To track the surface, we additionally introduce a prescribed hidden
layer to enforce the topological structure of the surface and use the network
to learn the homeomorphism between the surface and the prescribed topology. The
proposed network structure is designed to track the surface and solve the
equation simultaneously. Again, the numerical results show comparable accuracy
as the static cases. As an application, we simulate the surfactant transport on
the droplet surface under shear flow and obtain some physically plausible
results.

(AI) systems, especially for those societal applications, e.g., hiring systems
should recommend applicants equally from different demographic groups, and risk
assessment systems must eliminate racism in criminal justice. Existing efforts
towards the ethical development of AI systems have leveraged data science to
mitigate biases in the training set or introduced fairness principles into the
training process. For a deployed AI system, however, it may not allow for
retraining or tuning in practice. By contrast, we propose a more flexible
approach, i.e., fairness-aware adversarial perturbation (FAAP), which learns to
perturb input data to blind deployed models on fairness-related features, e.g.,
gender and ethnicity. The key advantage is that FAAP does not modify deployed
models in terms of parameters and structures. To achieve this, we design a
discriminator to distinguish fairness-related attributes based on latent
representations from deployed models. Meanwhile, a perturbation generator is
trained against the discriminator, such that no fairness-related features could
be extracted from perturbed inputs. Exhaustive experimental evaluation
demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed FAAP.
In addition, FAAP is validated on real-world commercial deployments
(inaccessible to model parameters), which shows the transferability of FAAP,
foreseeing the potential of black-box adaptation.

image recognition and gradually serves as a powerful backbone in various vision
tasks. To satisfy the sequential input of Transformer, the tail of ViT first
splits each image into a sequence of visual tokens with a fixed length. Then
the following self-attention layers constructs the global relationship between
tokens to produce useful representation for the downstream tasks. Empirically,
representing the image with more tokens leads to better performance, yet the
quadratic computational complexity of self-attention layer to the number of
tokens could seriously influence the efficiency of ViT's inference. For
computational reduction, a few pruning methods progressively prune
uninformative tokens in the Transformer encoder, while leaving the number of
tokens before the Transformer untouched. In fact, fewer tokens as the input for
the Transformer encoder can directly reduce the following computational cost.
In this spirit, we propose a Multi-Tailed Vision Transformer (MT-ViT) in the
paper. MT-ViT adopts multiple tails to produce visual sequences of different
lengths for the following Transformer encoder. A tail predictor is introduced
to decide which tail is the most efficient for the image to produce accurate
prediction. Both modules are optimized in an end-to-end fashion, with the
Gumbel-Softmax trick. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that MT-ViT can
achieve a significant reduction on FLOPs with no degradation of the accuracy
and outperform other compared methods in both accuracy and FLOPs.

integrates the features with an attention mechanism, and creates captions using
a recurrent neural network (RNN). To encode an image into a feature vector as
graphical attributes, we employed multiple pre-trained convolutional neural
networks. Following that, a language model known as GRU is chosen as the
decoder to construct the descriptive sentence. In order to increase
performance, we merge the Bahdanau attention model with GRU to allow learning
to be focused on a specific portion of the image. On the MSCOCO dataset, the
experimental results achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art
approaches.

  Hopping",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robots need lightweight legs for agile locomotion, and intrinsic series
elastic compliance has proven to be a major ingredient for energy-efficient
locomotion and robust locomotion control. Animals' anatomy and locomotion
capabilities emphasize the importance of that lightweight legs and integrated,
compact, series elastically actuated for distal leg joints. But unlike robots,
animals achieve series elastic actuation by their muscle-tendon units. So far
no designs are available that feature all characteristics of a perfect distal
legged locomotion actuator; a low-weight and low-inertia design, with high
mechanical efficiency, no stick and sliding friction, low mechanical
complexity, high-power output while being easy to mount. Ideally, such an
actuator can be controlled directly and without mechanical cross-coupling, for
example remotely. With this goal in mind, we propose a low-friction,
lightweight Series ELastic Diaphragm distal Actuator (SELDA) which meets many,
although not all, of the above requirements. We develop, implement, and
characterize a bioinspired robot leg that features a SELDA-actuated foot
segment. We compare two leg configurations controlled by a central pattern
generator that both feature agile forward hopping. By tuning SELDA's activation
timing, we effectively adjust the robot's hopping height by 11% and its forward
velocity by 14%, even with comparatively low power injection to the distal
joint.

or indirectly affects India's energy security, planning, and management. The
chaotic and nonlinear nature of atmospheric processes results in considerable
Internal Climate Variability (ICV) for future projections of climate variables.
Multiple Initial Condition Ensembles (MICE) and Multi-Model Ensembles (MME) are
often used to analyze the role of ICV and model uncertainty in precipitation
and temperature. However, there are limited studies focusing on quantifying the
role of internal variability on impact variables, including hydropower
production. In this study, we analyze the role of ICV and model uncertainty on
three prominent hydropower plants of India using MICE of EC-Earth3 and MME from
CMIP6. We estimate the streamflow projections for all ensembles using the
Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model for four time periods,
historical, near, mid and far-term. We estimate maximum hydropower production
generated using monthly release and hydraulic head available at the reservoir.
We also analyzed the role of bias correction in hydropower production. The
results show that ICV plays a significant role in estimating streamflow and
hydropower estimation for monsoon and throughout the year, respectively. Model
uncertainty contributes more to total uncertainty than ICV in estimating the
streamflow and potential hydropower. However, ICV is increasing towards the
far-term. We also show that bias correction does not preserve the internal
variability in estimating the streamflow. Although there is an increase in
uncertainty for estimated streamflow, mean hydropower shows the decrease
towards the far-term for February to May, more prominent for MICE than MME. The
results suggest a need to incorporate uncertainty due to internal variability
for addressing power security in changing climate scenarios.

modeling structural data. However, when adapted to downstream tasks, it usually
requires abundant task-specific labeled data, which can be extremely scarce in
practice. A promising solution to data scarcity is to pre-train a transferable
and expressive GNN model on large amounts of unlabeled graphs or coarse-grained
labeled graphs. Then the pre-trained GNN is fine-tuned on downstream datasets
with task-specific fine-grained labels. In this paper, we present a novel Graph
Matching based GNN Pre-Training framework, called GMPT. Focusing on a pair of
graphs, we propose to learn structural correspondences between them via neural
graph matching, consisting of both intra-graph message passing and inter-graph
message passing. In this way, we can learn adaptive representations for a given
graph when paired with different graphs, and both node- and graph-level
characteristics are naturally considered in a single pre-training task. The
proposed method can be applied to fully self-supervised pre-training and
coarse-grained supervised pre-training. We further propose an approximate
contrastive training strategy to significantly reduce time/memory consumption.
Extensive experiments on multi-domain, out-of-distribution benchmarks have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at:

efficient alternative to the use of dense unstructured random matrices across a
range of domains in computer science and machine learning. For several
applications such as dimensionality reduction and compressed sensing, the
theoretical guarantees for methods based on RHTs are comparable to approaches
using dense random matrices with i.i.d.\ entries. However, several such
applications are in the low-dimensional regime where the number of rows sampled
from the matrix is rather small. Prior arguments are not applicable to the
high-dimensional regime often found in machine learning applications like
kernel approximation. Given an ensemble of RHTs with Gaussian diagonals,
$\{M^i\}_{i = 1}^m$, and any $1$-Lipschitz function, $f: \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$, we prove that the average of $f$ over the entries of $\{M^i v\}_{i
= 1}^m$ converges to its expectation uniformly over $\| v \| \leq 1$ at a rate
comparable to that obtained from using truly Gaussian matrices. We use our
inequality to then derive improved guarantees for two applications in the
high-dimensional regime: 1) kernel approximation and 2) distance estimation.
For kernel approximation, we prove the first \emph{uniform} approximation
guarantees for random features constructed through RHTs lending theoretical
justification to their empirical success while for distance estimation, our
convergence result implies data structures with improved runtime guarantees
over previous work by the authors. We believe our general inequality is likely
to find use in other applications.

that has many potential applications. Recent methods for HMER have achieved
outstanding performance with an encoder-decoder architecture. However, these
methods adhere to the paradigm that the prediction is made ""from one character

structures of mathematical expressions or crabbed handwritings. In this paper,
we propose a simple and efficient method for HMER, which is the first to
incorporate syntax information into an encoder-decoder network. Specifically,
we present a set of grammar rules for converting the LaTeX markup sequence of
each expression into a parsing tree; then, we model the markup sequence
prediction as a tree traverse process with a deep neural network. In this way,
the proposed method can effectively describe the syntax context of expressions,
alleviating the structure prediction errors of HMER. Experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better recognition
performance than prior arts. To further validate the effectiveness of our
method, we create a large-scale dataset consisting of 100k handwritten
mathematical expression images acquired from ten thousand writers. The source

robust learning on graph data. However, for non-Euclidean graph data, the
existing GAN-based graph representation methods generate negative samples by
random walk or traverse in discrete space, leading to the information loss of
topological properties (e.g. hierarchy and circularity). Moreover, due to the
topological heterogeneity (i.e., different densities across the graph
structure) of graph data, they suffer from serious topological distortion
problems. In this paper, we proposed a novel Curvature Graph Generative
Adversarial Networks method, named \textbf{\modelname}, which is the first
GAN-based graph representation method in the Riemannian geometric manifold. To
better preserve the topological properties, we approximate the discrete
structure as a continuous Riemannian geometric manifold and generate negative
samples efficiently from the wrapped normal distribution. To deal with the
topological heterogeneity, we leverage the Ricci curvature for local structures
with different topological properties, obtaining to low-distortion
representations. Extensive experiments show that CurvGAN consistently and
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across multiple tasks
and shows superior robustness and generalization.

to develop models which are robust against small perturbations in the training
data. We study robust support vector machines (SVM) and extend the classical
approach by an ensemble method which iteratively solves a non-robust SVM on
different perturbations of the dataset, where the perturbations are derived by
an adversarial problem. Afterwards for classification of an unknown data point
we perform a majority vote of all calculated SVM solutions. We study three
different variants for the adversarial problem, the exact problem, a relaxed
variant and an efficient heuristic variant. While the exact and the relaxed
variant can be modeled using integer programming formulations, the heuristic
one can be implemented by an easy and efficient algorithm. All derived methods
are tested on random and realistic datasets and the results indicate that the
derived ensemble methods have a much more stable behaviour when changing the

destructive process. This feature is most apparent in the principle of
complementarity, which states that mutually incompatible observables cannot be
measured at the same time. Recent work by Broadbent and Islam (TCC 2020) builds
on this aspect of quantum mechanics to realize a cryptographic notion called
certified deletion. While this remarkable notion enables a classical verifier
to be convinced that a (private-key) quantum ciphertext has been deleted by an
untrusted party, it offers no additional layer of functionality.
  In this work, we augment the proof-of-deletion paradigm with fully
homomorphic encryption (FHE). We construct the first fully homomorphic
encryption scheme with certified deletion -- an interactive protocol which
enables an untrusted quantum server to compute on encrypted data and, if
requested, to simultaneously prove data deletion to a client. Our scheme has
the desirable property that verification of a deletion certificate is public;
meaning anyone can verify that deletion has taken place. Our main technical
ingredient is an interactive protocol by which a quantum prover can convince a
classical verifier that a sample from the Learning with Errors (LWE)
distribution in the form of a quantum state was deleted. As an application of
our protocol, we construct a Dual-Regev public-key encryption scheme with
certified deletion, which we then extend towards a (leveled) FHE scheme of the
same type. We introduce the notion of Gaussian-collapsing hash functions -- a
special case of collapsing hash functions defined by Unruh (Eurocrypt 2016) --
and we prove the security of our schemes under the assumption that the Ajtai
hash function satisfies a certain strong Gaussian-collapsing property in the
presence of leakage.

single pressure, imbalanced pressures, and balanced pressures applied in the
channels cause bidirectional coilings, opposite bendings, and elongation,
respectively, in a single unit actuator. Also, two U-shaped microchannels are
created, and by injecting a gel-based conductive material, the actuator is
equipped with resistive sensors which are responsive to a vast dynamic range
from a small oscillation to a large elongation. This actuator has so many
promising features as a multifunctional soft gripper, and its embedded soft
sensors enable it to have better controllability in real problems. The
multifunctionality of this actuator has been validated with several

a frontier of critical levels of ""proven"" reserves exists, above which

this stochastic generalization of Hotelling's rule, the expected shadow price
of reserves rises at the rate of interest across exploratory episodes. However,
the actual trajectories of prices realized prior to exhaustion of the

antiferromagnetically at $T_{\rm N} = 70$ mK and exhibits an unconventional
quantum critical point (QCP) of Kondo-destroying type at $B_{\rm N} = 60$ mT,
for the magnetic field applied within the basal ($a,b$) plane.
Ultra-low-temperature magnetization and heat-capacity measurements at very low
fields indicate that the 4$f$-electronic antiferromagnetic (AF) order is
strongly suppressed by a nuclear-dominated hybrid order (`A-phase') at $T_{\rm
A} \le 2.3$ mK, such that quantum critical fluctuations develop at $B \approx
0$ (Schuberth et al., Science \textbf{351}, 485 (2016)). This enables the onset
of heavy-fermion superconductivity ($T_{\rm c} = 2$ mK) which appears to be
suppressed by the primary AF order at elevated temperatures. Measurements of
the Meissner effect reveal bulk superconductivity, with $T_{\rm c}$ decreasing
under applied field to $T_{\rm c} < 1$ mK at $B > 20$ mT. The observation of a
weak but distinct superconducting shielding signal at a temperature as high as
10 mK suggests the formation of insulated random islands with emergent A-phase
order and superconductivity. Upon cooling, the shielding signal increases
almost linearly in temperature, indicating a growth of the islands which
eventually percolate at $T \approx 6.5$ mK. Recent electrical-resistivity
results by Nguyen et al. (Nat. Commun. \textbf{12}, 4341 (2021)) confirm the
existence of superconductivity in YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ at ultra-low temperatures. The
combination of the results of Schuberth et al. and Nguyen et al. at ultra-low
temperatures below $B_{\rm N}$, along with those previously established at
higher temperatures in the paramagnetic state, provide compelling evidence that
the Kondo-destruction quantum criticality robustly drives unconventional
superconductivity.

mode numbers ($40 \leq n \leq 70$), unstable Alfv\'enic modes have been
observed close to rational surfaces and are labelled as Beta-induced Alfv\'en
eigenmodes (BAE)/Alfv\'enic Ion Temperature Gradient (AITG) modes, since their
frequency is associated with the BAE gap and they are driven by the bulk plasma
on the Alfv\'enic continuum. These modes are unstable in the absence of
energetic particles, and adding a species of energetic particles (with an
isotropic 1 MeV slowing down distribution) has negligible impact on their
growth rate. At higher toroidal mode numbers ($150 \lessapprox n < 220$), low
frequency microscale instabilities are observed.

dynamical properties of biological systems. Several dynamical interpretations
have been proposed based on the same logical structure that captures the
interactions between Boolean components. They reproduce, in different degrees,
the behaviours emerging in more quantitative models. In particular, regulatory
conflicts can prevent the standard asynchronous dynamics from reproducing some
trajectories that might be expected upon inspection of more detailed models. We
introduce and study the class of networks with linear cuts, where linear
components -- intermediates with a single regulator and a single target --
eliminate the aforementioned regulatory conflicts. The interaction graph of a
Boolean network admits a linear cut when a linear component occurs in each
cycle and in each path from components with multiple targets to components with
multiple regulators. Under this structural condition the attractors are in
one-to-one correspondence with the minimal trap spaces, and the reachability of
attractors can also be easily characterized. Linear cuts provide the base for a
new interpretation of the Boolean semantics that captures all behaviours of
multi-valued refinements with regulatory thresholds that are uniquely defined
for each interaction, and contribute a new approach for the investigation of
behaviour of logical models.

paramount importance to facilitate the growth of new technologies, and the
development of efficient and effective supply chains. The harmonisation of
technologies, methodologies, and interfaces enables interoperable products,

cosmic shear power spectrum. We find that such biases can be measured by
performing regression on calibration data. We find that for integer powers of

additional bispectrum dependency; ignoring quadratic terms can lead to biases
in cosmological parameters of up to $2(m_2+m_{-2}-m_6)0.4\sigma$ for Stage-IV
dark energy experiments, but that the susceptibility to them can be decreased
by using methods to remove small-scale sensitivity. We also find, for

wide range of uses. We aim to construct 3D maps of dust extinction in the Local
Arm and surrounding regions. Gaia EDR3 photometric data were combined with
2MASS measurements to derive extinction towards stars with accurate photometry
and relative uncertainties on parallaxes of less than 20%. We applied our
hierarchical inversion algorithm adapted to inhomogeneous spatial distributions
of target stars to this catalogue of extinctions. We present the updated 3D
dust extinction distribution and provide an estimate of the error on integrated
extinctions from the Sun to each area in the 3D map. The computational area is
similar to the one of the previous DR2 map, a 6 kpc x 6 kpc x 0.8
kpcAstrophysics volume around the Sun. Due to the addition of fainter target
stars, the volume in which the clouds can be reconstructed has increased. Due
to the improved accuracy of the parallaxes and photometric data in EDR3,
extinctions among neighbouring targets are more consistent, allowing one to
reach an increased contrast in the dense areas, while cavity contours are more
regular. We show several comparisons with recent results on dust and star
distributions. The wavy pattern around the Plane of the dust concentrations is
better seen and exists over large regions. Its mean vertical peak-to-peak
amplitude is of the order of 300 pc; interestingly, it is similar to the
vertical period of the spectacular snail-shaped stellar kinematical pattern
discovered in Gaia data. The Gaia EDR3 catalogue allows for a significant
improvement of the extinction maps to be made and the hierarchical technique
confirms its efficiency for massive datasets. Future comparisons between 3D
maps of interstellar matter and stellar distributions may help to understand
which mergers or internal perturbations have shaped the Galaxy within the first

to recover a feasible and approximately optimal solution of the MMOT problem,

mild conditions. The developed relaxation scheme leads to a numerical algorithm
which can compute a feasible approximate optimizer of the MMOT problem whose

approximate optimizer, the algorithm is also able to compute both an upper

feature extraction methods are capable of reducing the size of the data for

therefore is helpful not only in inference but also in reducing management
costs. This work presents a novel parallel feature selection approach for
classification, namely Parallel Feature Selection using Trace criterion (PFST),
which scales up to very large datasets. Our method uses trace criterion, a
measure of class separability used in Fisher's Discriminant Analysis, to
evaluate feature usefulness. We analyzed the criterion's desirable properties
theoretically. Based on the criterion, PFST rapidly finds important features
out of a set of features for big datasets by first making a forward selection
with early removal of seemingly redundant features parallelly. After the most
important features are included in the model, we check back their contribution
for possible interaction that may improve the fit. Lastly, we make a backward
selection to check back possible redundant added by the forward steps. We
evaluate our methods via various experiments using Linear Discriminant Analysis
as the classifier on selected features. The experiments show that our method
can produce a small set of features in a fraction of the amount of time by the
other methods under comparison. In addition, the classifier trained on the
features selected by PFST not only achieves better accuracy than the ones
chosen by other approaches but can also achieve better accuracy than the
classification on all available features.

  computed tomography","14 pages, 8 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Spectral computed tomography has received considerable interest in recent
years since spectral measurements contain much richer information about the
object of interest. In spectral computed tomography, we are interested in the
energy channel-wise reconstructions of the object. However, such
reconstructions suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and share the challenges
of conventional low-dose computed tomography such as ring artifacts. Ring
artifacts arise from errors in the flat-field correction and can significantly
degrade the quality of the reconstruction. We propose an extended flat-field
model that exploits high correlation in the spectral flat-fields to reduce ring
artifacts in the channel-wise reconstructions. The extended model relies on the
assumption that the spectral flat-fields can be well-approximated by a low-rank
matrix. Our proposed model works directly on the spectral flat-fields and can
be combined with any existing reconstruction model, e.g., filtered back
projection and iterative methods. The proposed model is validated on a neutron
data set. The results show that our method successfully diminishes ring
artifacts and improves the quality of the reconstructions. Moreover, the
results indicate that our method is robust; it only needs a single spectral
flat-field image, whereas existing methods need multiple spectral flat-field
images to reach a similar level of ring reduction.

perturbation theory to Maxwell's equations with boundary conditions, proves to
be very powerful. It generalizes the effective 1-dimensional description of

monitoring (SHM), is to use data-driven models to make predictions and
inferences about structures and their condition. Such methods almost
exclusively rely on the quality of the data. Within the SHM discipline, data do
not always suffice to build models with satisfactory accuracy for given tasks.
Even worse, data may be completely missing from one's dataset, regarding the
behaviour of a structure under different environmental conditions. In the
current work, with a view to confronting such issues, the generation of
artificial data using a variation of the generative adversarial network (GAN)
algorithm, is used. The aforementioned variation is that of the conditional GAN
or cGAN. The algorithm is not only used to generate artificial data, but also
to learn transformations of manifolds according to some known parameters.
Assuming that the structure's response is represented by points in a manifold,
part of the space will be formed due to variations in external conditions
affecting the structure. This idea proves efficient in SHM, as it is exploited
to generate structural data for specific values of environmental coefficients.
The scheme is applied here on a simulated structure which operates under
different temperature and humidity conditions. The cGAN is trained on data for
some discrete values of the temperature within some range, and is able to
generate data for every temperature in this range with satisfactory accuracy.
The novelty, compared to classic regression in similar problems, is that the
cGAN allows unknown environmental parameters to affect the structure and can
generate whole manifolds of data for every value of the known parameters, while
the unknown ones vary within the generated manifolds.

A key challenge is planning missions to maximize the value of acquired data in

relevant for monitoring agricultural fields. This paper addresses the problem
of adaptive path planning for accurate semantic segmentation of using UAVs. We
propose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtain
high-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas with fine details as
they are detected in incoming images. This enables us to perform close
inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting energy on
exhaustive mapping at maximum image resolution. A key feature of our approach
is a new accuracy model for deep learning-based architectures that captures the
relationship between UAV altitude and semantic segmentation accuracy. We
evaluate our approach on different domains using real-world data, proving the
efficacy and generability of our solution.

health monitoring (PBSHM), to transfer knowledge between SHM models of
different structures. The attempts have been focussed on homogeneous and
heterogeneous populations. A more general approach to transferring knowledge
between structures, is by considering all plausible structures as points on a
multidimensional base manifold and building a fibre bundle. The idea is quite
powerful, since, a mapping between points in the base manifold and their
fibres, the potential states of any arbitrary structure, can be learnt. A
smaller scale problem, but still useful, is that of learning a specific point
of every fibre, i.e. that corresponding to the undamaged state of structures
within a population. Under the framework of PBSHM, a data-driven approach to
the aforementioned problem is developed. Structures are converted into graphs
and inference is attempted within a population, using a graph neural network
(GNN) algorithm. The algorithm solves a major problem existing in such
applications. Structures comprise different sizes and are defined as abstract
objects, thus attempting to perform inference within a heterogeneous population
is not trivial. The proposed approach is tested in a simulated population of
trusses. The goal of the application is to predict the first natural frequency
of trusses of different sizes, across different environmental temperatures and
having different bar member types. After training the GNN using part of the
total population, it was tested on trusses that were not included in the
training dataset. Results show that the accuracy of the regression is
satisfactory even in structures with higher number of nodes and members than
those used to train it.

sky in the 0.95-2.02 $\mu$m range, to a 5$\sigma$ point-source median depth of
24.4 AB mag. This unique photometric data set will find wide use beyond
Euclid's core science. In this paper, we present accurate computations of the
Euclid Y_E, J_E and H_E passbands used by the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and
Photometer (NISP), and the associated photometric system. We pay particular
attention to passband variations in the field of view, accounting among others
for spatially variable filter transmission, and variations of the angle of
incidence on the filter substrate using optical ray tracing. The response
curves' cut-on and cut-off wavelengths - and their variation in the field of
view - are determined with 0.8 nm accuracy, essential for the photometric
redshift accuracy required by Euclid. After computing the photometric
zeropoints in the AB mag system, we present linear transformations from and to
common ground-based near-infrared photometric systems, for normal stars, red
and brown dwarfs, and galaxies separately. A Python tool to compute accurate
magnitudes for arbitrary passbands and spectral energy distributions is
provided. We discuss various factors from space weathering to material
outgassing that may slowly alter Euclid's spectral response. At the absolute
flux scale, the Euclid in-flight calibration program connects the NISP
photometric system to Hubble Space Telescope spectrophotometric white dwarf
standards; at the relative flux scale, the chromatic evolution of the response
is tracked at the milli-mag level. In this way, we establish an accurate
photometric system that is fully controlled throughout Euclid's lifetime.

earth observation. However, supervised deep learning models for segmentation
rely on large amounts of high-quality labelled data, which is labour-intensive
and time-consuming to generate. To address this, we propose a new approach for
using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously collect useful data for
model training. We exploit a Bayesian approach to estimate model uncertainty in
semantic segmentation. During a mission, the semantic predictions and model
uncertainty are used as input for terrain mapping. A key aspect of our pipeline
is to link the mapped model uncertainty to a robotic planning objective based
on active learning. This enables us to adaptively guide a UAV to gather the
most informative terrain images to be labelled by a human for model training.
Our experimental evaluation on real-world data shows the benefit of using our
informative planning approach in comparison to static coverage paths in terms
of maximising model performance and reducing labelling efforts.

cyclic groups and, when $n$ is even, the problem is still open. An attempt to
obtain a fairly precise description of groups and $1-$factorizations satisfying

recently proved, see Rinaldi (2021) and Mazzuoccolo et al. (2019), that a
$G-$regular $1-$factorization together with a complete set of rainbow spanning
trees exists whenever $n$ is odd, while the existence for each $n$ even was
proved when either $G$ is cyclic and $n$ is not a power of $2$, or when $G$ is
a dihedral group. In this paper we extend this result and prove the existence
also for other classes of groups.

significant flexibility. The exploitation of that flexibility in demand
response (DR) algorithms becomes increasingly important to manage and balance
demand and supply in power grids. Model-free DR based on reinforcement learning
(RL) is an attractive approach to balance such EV charging load. We build on
previous research on RL, based on a Markov decision process (MDP) to
simultaneously coordinate multiple charging stations. However, we note that the
computationally expensive cost function adopted in the previous research leads
to large training times, which limits the feasibility and practicality of the
approach. We, therefore, propose an improved cost function that essentially
forces the learned control policy to always fulfill any charging demand that
does not offer any flexibility. We rigorously compare the newly proposed batch
RL fitted Q-iteration implementation with the original (costly) one, using
real-world data. Specifically, for the case of load flattening, we compare the
two approaches in terms of (i) the processing time to learn the RL-based
charging policy, as well as (ii) the overall performance of the policy
decisions in terms of meeting the target load for unseen test data. The
performance is analyzed for different training periods and varying training
sample sizes. In addition to both RL policies performance results, we provide
performance bounds in terms of both (i) an optimal all-knowing strategy, and
(ii) a simple heuristic spreading individual EV charging uniformly over time

transfer learning is applied to a structural health monitoring problem. The
specific problem in this case is that of localising damage on an aircraft wing.
The original experiment is described, together with the initial approach, in
which a neural network was trained to localise damage. The results were not
ideal, partly because of a scarcity of training data, and partly because of the
difficulty in resolving two of the damage cases. In the current paper, the
problem is split into two sub-problems and an increase in classification
accuracy is obtained. The sub-problems are obtained by separating out the most
difficult-to-classify damage cases. A second approach to the problem is
considered by adopting ideas from transfer learning (usually applied in much
deeper) networks to see if a network trained on the simpler damage cases can
help with feature extraction in the more difficult cases. The transfer of a
fixed trained batch of layers between the networks is found to improve
classification by making the classes more separable in the feature space and to
speed up convergence.

electrolyte solutions are important design parameters for electrochemical
energy storage devices. Recent observation of negative transference numbers in
PEO-LiTFSI under certain conditions has generated much discussion about its
molecular origins, by both experimental and theoretical means. However, one
overlooked factor in these efforts is the importance of the reference frame
(RF). This creates a non-negligible gap when comparing experiment and
simulation, because the fluxes in the experimental measurements of transport
coefficients and in the linear response theory used in the molecular dynamics
simulation are defined in different RFs. In this work, we show that by applying
a proper RF transformation, a much improved agreement between experimental and
simulation results can be achieved. Moreover, it is revealed that the anion
mass and the anion-anion correlation, rather than ion aggregates, play a
crucial role for the reported negative transference numbers.

role in this ecosystem by issuing certificates. These authorities may misissue
certificates or suffer misuse attacks, however, which has given rise to the
Certificate Transparency (CT) project. The goal of CT is to store all issued
certificates in public logs, which can then be checked for the presence of
potentially misissued certificates. Thus, the requirement that a given
certificate is indeed in one (or several) of these logs lies at the core of CT.
In its current deployment, however, most individual clients do not check that
the certificates they see are in logs, as requesting a proof of inclusion
directly reveals the certificate and thus creates the clear potential for a
violation of that client's privacy. In this paper, we explore the techniques
that have been proposed for privacy-preserving auditing of certificate
inclusion, focusing on their effectiveness, efficiency, and suitability in a
near-term deployment. In doing so, we also explore the parallels with related
problems involving browser clients. Guided by a set of constraints that we
develop, we ultimately observe several key limitations in many proposals,
ranging from their privacy provisions to the fact that they focus on the
interaction between a client and a log but leave open the question of how a
client could privately report any certificates that are missing.

Though some effort has been devoted to employing such ""learn-to-exit"" modules,

of employing anomalous images to set a class-specific threshold to locate the
anomalies. This limits their usability in realistic scenarios, where only
normal data is typically accessible. Despite this major drawback, only a
handful of works have addressed this limitation, by integrating supervision on
attention maps during training. In this work, we propose a novel formulation

constraint is formulated in a more principled manner, leveraging well-known
knowledge in constrained optimization. In particular, the equality constraint
on the attention maps in prior work is replaced by an inequality constraint,
which allows more flexibility. In addition, to address the limitations of
penalty-based functions we employ an extension of the popular log-barrier

propose the Cross-Modality Earth Mover's Distance (CM-EMD) that can alleviate
the impact of the intra-identity variations during modality alignment. CM-EMD
selects an optimal transport strategy and assigns high weights to pairs that
have a smaller intra-identity variation. In this manner, the model will focus
on reducing the inter-modality discrepancy while paying less attention to
intra-identity variations, leading to a more effective modality alignment.
Moreover, we introduce two techniques to improve the advantage of CM-EMD.
First, the Cross-Modality Discrimination Learning (CM-DL) is designed to
overcome the discrimination degradation problem caused by modality alignment.
By reducing the ratio between intra-identity and inter-identity variances,
CM-DL leads the model to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we
construct the Multi-Granularity Structure (MGS), enabling us to align
modalities from both coarse- and fine-grained levels with the proposed CM-EMD.
Extensive experiments show the benefits of the proposed CM-EMD and its

  Commodity Vision Data",,,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  With the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) industry shifting towards machine-learned
approaches for motion planning, the performance of self-driving systems is
starting to rely heavily on large quantities of expert driving demonstrations.
However, collecting this demonstration data typically involves expensive HD
sensor suites (LiDAR + RADAR + cameras), which quickly becomes financially
infeasible at the scales required. This motivates the use of commodity sensors
like cameras for data collection, which are an order of magnitude cheaper than
HD sensor suites, but offer lower fidelity. Leveraging these sensors for
training an AV motion planner opens a financially viable path to observe the
`long tail' of driving events. As our main contribution we show it is possible
to train a high-performance motion planner using commodity vision data which
outperforms planners trained on HD-sensor data for a fraction of the cost. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate this using
real-world data. We compare the performance of the autonomy system on these two
different sensor configurations, and show that we can compensate for the lower
sensor fidelity by means of increased quantity: a planner trained on 100h of
commodity vision data outperforms the one with 25h of expensive HD data. We
also share the engineering challenges we had to tackle to make this work.

adaptive (UDA) re-ID, aims to transfer the identity-discriminative knowledge
from the source to the target domain. Existing methods commonly consider the
source and target domains are isolated from each other, i.e., no intermediate
status is modeled between both domains. Directly transferring the knowledge
between two isolated domains can be very difficult, especially when the domain
gap is large. From a novel perspective, we assume these two domains are not
completely isolated, but can be connected through intermediate domains. Instead
of directly aligning the source and target domains against each other, we
propose to align the source and target domains against their intermediate
domains for a smooth knowledge transfer. To discover and utilize these
intermediate domains, we propose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) and a
Mirrors Generation Module (MGM). IDM has two functions: 1) it generates
multiple intermediate domains by mixing the hidden-layer features from source
and target domains and 2) it dynamically reduces the domain gap between the
source / target domain features and the intermediate domain features. While IDM
achieves good domain alignment, it introduces a side effect, i.e., the mix-up
operation may mix the identities into a new identity and lose the original
identities. To compensate this, MGM is introduced by mapping the features into
the IDM-generated intermediate domains without changing their original
identity. It allows to focus on minimizing domain variations to promote the
alignment between the source / target domain and intermediate domains, which
reinforces IDM into IDM++. We extensively evaluate our method under both the
UDA and domain generalization (DG) scenarios and observe that IDM++ yields
consistent performance improvement for cross-domain re-ID, achieving new state
of the art.

forms of persistent IoT malware. Less is known about persistent malware, which
resides on persistent storage, requiring targeted manual effort to remove it.
This paper presents a field study on the removal of persistent IoT malware by
consumers. We partnered with an ISP to contrast remediation times of 760
customers across three malware categories: Windows malware, non-persistent IoT
malware, and persistent IoT malware. We also contacted ISP customers identified
as having persistent IoT malware on their network-attached storage devices,
specifically QSnatch. We found that persistent IoT malware exhibits a mean
infection duration many times higher than Windows or Mirai malware; QSnatch has
a survival probability of 30% after 180 days, whereby most if not all other
observed malware types have been removed. For interviewed device users, QSnatch
infections lasted longer, so are apparently more difficult to get rid of, yet
participants did not report experiencing difficulty in following notification
instructions. We see two factors driving this paradoxical finding: First, most
users reported having high technical competency. Also, we found evidence of
planning behavior for these tasks and the need for multiple notifications. Our
findings demonstrate the critical nature of interventions from outside for
persistent malware, since automatic scan of an AV tool or a power cycle, like
we are used to for Windows malware and Mirai infections, will not solve
persistent IoT malware infections.

behavior. For example, the emission of neutrons in a nuclear reactor channel
above the specified threshold is an anomaly. Big data refers to the data set
that is \emph{high volume, streaming, heterogeneous, distributed} and often
\emph{sparse}. Big data is not uncommon these days. For example, as per
Internet live stats, the number of tweets posted per day has gone above 500
millions. Due to data explosion in data laden domains, traditional anomaly
detection techniques developed for small data sets scale poorly on large-scale
data sets. Therefore, we take an alternative approach to tackle anomaly
detection in big data. Essentially, there are two ways to scale anomaly
detection in big data. The first is based on the \emph{online} learning and the
second is based on the \emph{distributed} learning. Our aim in the thesis is to
tackle big data problems while detecting anomaly efficiently. To that end, we
first take \emph{streaming} issue of the big data and propose
Passive-Aggressive GMEAN (PAGMEAN) algorithms. Although, online learning
algorithm can scale well over large number of data points and dimensions, they
can not process data when it is distributed at multiple locations; which is
quite common these days. Therefore, we propose anomaly detection algorithm

of plage regions remains highly unconstrained from observational studies. The
purpose of our study is to estimate the chromospheric heating terms from a
plage dataset, characterize their spatio-temporal distribution and set
constraints on the heating processes that are at work. We make use of NLTE
inversions to infer a model of the photosphere and chromosphere of a plage
dataset acquired with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We use this model
atmosphere to calculate the chromospheric radiative losses from H i, Ca ii and
Mg ii atoms. We approximate the chromospheric heating terms by the net
radiative losses predicted by the inverted model. In order to make the analysis
of time-series over a large field-of-view computationally tractable, we make
use of a neural network. In the lower chromosphere, the contribution from the
Ca ii lines is dominant and located in the surroundings of the photospheric
footpoints. In the upper chromosphere, the H i contribution is dominant.
Radiative losses in the upper chromosphere form an homogeneous patch that
covers the plage region. The net radiative losses can be split in a periodic
component with an average amplitude of ampQ = 7.6 kW m^{-2} and a static (or
very slowly evolving) component with a mean value of -26.1 kW m^{-2}. Our
interpretation is that in the lower chromosphere, the radiative losses are
tracing the sharp lower edge of the hot magnetic canopy, where the electric
current is expected to be large. In the upper chromosphere, both the magnetic
field and the distribution of net radiative losses are room-filling, whereas
the amplitude of the periodic component is largest. Our results suggest that
acoustic wave heating may be responsible for one third of the energy deposition
in the upper chromosphere, whereas other heating mechanisms must be responsible
for the rest.

emergent synchrony becomes resilient against a small or large parameter
drifting. In addition, the stability of the synchronous state is enhanced from
local stability to global stability of synchrony. By the addition of
cross-coupling, the network revives complete synchrony in all the nodes except
the perturbed nodes, which emerges into a type of generalized synchrony with
all the unperturbed nodes. The generalized synchrony is manifested simply by a
linear amplitude response in the state variable(s) of the perturbed node(s) by
a scaling factor proportional to the mismatch. A set of systematic rules has
been derived from the linear flow matrix of the dynamical system representing
the nodes dynamics that helps find the connectivity matrix of the
cross-coupling links. Lyapunov function stability condition is used to
determine the cross-coupling link strength that, in turn, establishes global
stability of synchrony of the multiplex network. We verify the efficacy of our
proposed coupling scheme with analytical results and numerical simulations of
two examples of multiplex networks. In the first example, we use non-local
connectivity in each layer, with nodal dynamics of the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron
model.

calculate topological features of 3D volume data and employs an optimal

that topological information substantially improves the quality of
reconstructions, thus highlighting its ability to extract more relevant

considered quantum codes-the five-qubit code, also known as the smallest
perfect code that permits corrections of generic single-qubit errors. With
direct but complicated computation, we obtain explicit process matrix of the
coding maps with a unital error channel for the five-qubit code. The process
matrix allows us to conduct exact analysis on the performance of the quantum
code. We prove that the code can correct a generic error in the sense that
under repeated concatenation of the coding map with itself, the code does not
make any assumption about the error model other than it being weak and thus can
remove the error(it can transform/take the error channel to the identity
channel if the error is sufficiently small.). We focus on the examination of
some coherent error models (non diagonal channels) studied in recent
literatures. We numerically derive a lower bound on threshold of the
convergence for the code. Furthermore, we analytically show how the code
affects the average gate infidelity and diamond distance of the error channels.
Explicit formulas of the two measurements for both pre-error channel and

vectors (with values in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$) which converge
after normalization to a multidimensional Gaussian distribution. More precisely
we refine such results in two directions: first we give conditions under which
one can obtain bounds on the speed of convergence to the multidimensional
Gaussian distribution, and then we provide a setting in which one can obtain
precise moderate or large deviations (in particular we see at which scale the
Gaussian approximation for the tails ceases to hold and how the symmetry of the
Gaussian tails is then broken). These results extend some of our earlier works
obtained for real valued random variables, but they are not simple extensions,
as some new phenomena are observed that could not be visible in one dimension.
Even for very simple objects such as the symmetric random walk in
$\mathbb{Z}^d$, we observe a loss of symmetry that we can quantify for walks
conditioned to be far away from the origin. Also, unlike the one dimensional
case where the Kolmogorov distance is natural, in the multidimensional case
there is no more such a canonical distance. We choose to work with the
so-called convex distance, and as a consequence, the geometry of the Borel
measurable sets that we consider shall play an important role (also making the
proofs more complicated). We illustrate our results with some examples such as
correlated random walks, the characteristic polynomials of random unitary

discriminative object parts rather than the whole object, weakening its
performance for localizing objects. To avoid this problem, this work provides a
novel perspective that models WSOL as a domain adaption (DA) task, where the
score estimator trained on the source/image domain is tested on the
target/pixel domain to locate objects. Under this perspective, a DA-WSOL
pipeline is designed to better engage DA approaches into WSOL to enhance
localization performance. It utilizes a proposed target sampling strategy to
select different types of target samples. Based on these types of target
samples, domain adaption localization (DAL) loss is elaborated. It aligns the

perceive target domain cues by Universum regularization. Experiments show that

space. Specifically, one can use the activation times of threshold contagions
to construct contagion maps as a manifold-learning approach. One drawback of
contagion maps is their high computational cost. Here, we demonstrate that a
truncation of the threshold contagions may considerably speed up the
construction of contagion maps. Finally, we show that contagion maps may be
used to find an insightful low-dimensional embedding for single-cell
RNA-sequencing data in the form of cell-similarity networks and so reveal
biological manifolds. Overall, our work makes the use of contagion maps as
manifold-learning approaches on empirical network data more viable.

the average delay of jobs in homogeneous systems consisting of identical
servers. However, it performs poorly in heterogeneous systems where servers
have different processing rates. Finding a delay optimal scheme remains an open
problem for heterogeneous systems. In this paper, we consider a speed-aware
version of the JSQ scheme for heterogeneous systems and show that it achieves
delay optimality in the fluid limit. One of the key issues in establishing this
optimality result for heterogeneous systems is to show that the sequence of
steady-state distributions indexed by the system size is tight in an
appropriately defined space. The usual technique for showing tightness by
coupling with a suitably defined dominant system does not work for
heterogeneous systems. To prove tightness, we devise a new technique that uses
the drift of exponential Lyapunov functions. Using the non-negativity of the
drift, we show that the stationary queue length distribution has an
exponentially decaying tail - a fact we use to prove tightness. Another
technical difficulty arises due to the complexity of the underlying state-space
and the separation of two time-scales in the fluid limit. Due to these factors,
the fluid-limit turns out to be a function of the invariant distribution of a
multi-dimensional Markov chain which is hard to characterise. By using some
properties of this invariant distribution and using the monotonicity of the
system, we show that the fluid limit is has a unique and globally attractive
fixed point.

Gaussian Process approach (GDNorm) for generalizable person re-identification,
which models the feature statistic estimation from BN layers as a dynamically
self-refining Gaussian process to alleviate the bias to unseen domain for
improving the generalization. Specifically, we establish a lightweight model
with multiple set of domain-specific BN layers to capture the discriminability
of individual source domain, and learn the corresponding parameters of the
domain-specific BN layers. These parameters of different source domains are
employed to deduce a Gaussian process. We randomly sample several paths from
this Gaussian process served as the BN estimations of potential new domains
outside of existing source domains, which can further optimize these learned
parameters from source domains, and estimate more accurate Gaussian process by
them in return, tending to real data distribution. Even without a large number
of source domains, GDNorm can still provide debiased BN estimation by using the
mean path of the Gaussian process, while maintaining low computational cost
during testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GDNorm effectively
improves the generalization ability of the model on unseen domain.

leading post-Newtonian (PN) order. Utilizing the method of osculating orbits

orbital dynamics of a (generically eccentric) binary in terms of the
dimensionless modulus parameters $\epsilon_{m}$, corresponding to axial $m=1$

the benefit of ensembling, especially when using geometric averages to combine

one is completely untrusted in which all workers collude to eavesdrop on the

trusted cluster, only up to $z$ workers may collude and to which revealing
small amount of information about the input matrix is allowed. We design a

unknown interface variables are introduced and a suitably defined cost
functional, expressing the error in fulfilling interface conditions, is

thanks to the use of independent discretizations on the various subdomains.
Meshes of different sizes can be used without affecting the conditioning of the

efficient way, that is, for each size the number of jobs of that size is given

scheduling on uniform machines where a job of size $p_j$ takes time $p_j/s_i$
on a machine of speed $s_i$. Classical (NP-hard) objectives are Makespan
minimization ($C_{\max}$) and Santa Claus ($C_{\min}$). We show that both

number of different job sizes and $|I|$ the encoding length of the instance.
Our approach incorporates two structural theorems: The first allows us to
replace machines of large speed by multiple machines of smaller speed. The
second tells us that some fractional assignments can be used to reduce the

results. For the problem Envy Minimization ($C_{\mathit{envy}}$), we propose an
$\mathcal O(s_{\max} \cdot p_{\max}^{\mathcal O(d^3)} \operatorname{poly} |I|)$

conclude that the common envelope efficiency is likely similar in close white
dwarf plus AFGK binaries and PCEBs with M-dwarf companions and find a wide
range of possible evolutionary histories for both systems. While TYC
3858-1215-1 will run into dynamically unstable mass transfer that will cause
the two stars to merge and evolve into a single white dwarf, TYC 110-755-1 is a

challenging problem in large-scale networks. Approximate methods can quickly
estimate nodes' centrality and identify the most central nodes, but the ranking
for the majority of remaining nodes may be meaningless. For example, ranking
for less-known websites in search queries is known to be noisy and unstable. To
this end, we investigate a new node ranking problem with two important
distinctions: a) ranking quality, rather than the centrality estimation
quality, as the primary objective; and b) ranking only nodes of interest, e.g.,
websites that matched search criteria. We propose Sample space Partitioning
Hypothesis Ranking, or SaPHyRa, that transforms node ranking into a hypothesis
ranking in machine learning. This transformation maps nodes' centrality to the
expected risks of hypotheses, opening doors for theoretical machine learning
(ML) tools. The key of SaPHyRa is to partition the sample space into exact and
approximate subspaces. The exact subspace contains samples related to the nodes
of interest, increasing both estimation and ranking qualities. The approximate
space can be efficiently sampled with ML-based techniques to provide
theoretical guarantees on the estimation error. Lastly, we present SaPHyRa_bc,
an illustration of SaPHyRa on ranking nodes' betweenness centrality (BC). By
combining a novel bi-component sampling, a 2-hop sample partitioning, and
improved bounds on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, SaPHyRa_bc can
effectively rank any node subset in BC. Its performance is up to 200x faster
than state-of-the-art methods in approximating BC, while its rank correlation
to the ground truth is improved by multifold.

they find a bicritical phase-diagram. Here this discrepancy is resolved: after
generalizing a ubiquitous condition identifying the tetracritical point, we

at three dimensions. These show that the experiments and simulations results
can only be understood if their trajectories flow towards the

challenges. In this work, a comparison between two different plasma systems

the two devices is how the long plastic tube was assembled. The first one uses
a copper wire placed inside a long plastic tube. The other device has a
metallic mesh installed in a concentric arrangement between two coaxial plastic
tubes. As a result, the two APPJ systems exhibit different properties, with the
wire assembly being more powerful, also presenting higher values for the
electrical current and rotational temperature when compared to the mesh
mounting. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrates that both
configurations were capable of inserting O-containing functional groups on the
polypropylene (PP) surface. However, the transferred plasma jet with wire
assembly was able to add more functional groups on the PP surface. The results
from XPS analysis were corroborated with water contact angle measurements
(WCA), being that lower WCA values were obtained when the PP surface presented
higher amounts of O-containing groups. Surface morphology evaluation showed
that the plasma treatment tends to slightly increase the surface roughness of
the PP samples with both wire and mesh configurations. Furthermore, the
findings in this work suggest that the APPJ with wire configuration is more
appropriate for material treatments, while the transferred jet with mesh
arrangement tends to present lower electrical current values which makes it
more suitable for biological applications.

following polarization-dependent trajectories. Similarly, in curved spacetime
the gravitational spin Hall effect of light is represented by
polarization-dependent deviations from null geodesics. In this paper, we
analyze the equations of motion describing the gravitational spin Hall effect
of light. We show that these equations are a special case of the
Mathisson-Papapetrou equations for spinning objects in general relativity. This
allows us to use several known results for the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations,
and apply them to the study of electromagnetic wave packets. We derive
conservation laws, we discuss the limits of validity of the spin Hall
equations, and we study how the energy centroids of wave packets, effectively
described as massless spinning particles, depend on the external choice of a
timelike vector field, representing a family of observers. In flat spacetime,
the relativistic Hall effect and the Wigner(-Souriau) translations are
recovered, while our equations also provide a generalization of these effects
in arbitrary spacetimes. We construct a large class of wave packets that can be
described by the spin Hall equations, but also find its limits by giving
examples of wave packets which are more general and are not described by the
spin Hall equations. Lastly, we examine the assumption that electromagnetic
wave packets are massless. While this is approximately true in many contexts,
it is not exact. We show that failing to carefully account for the limitations
of the massless approximation results in the appearance of unphysical centroids

broken sublattice symmetry. The simulator consists of a structured lateral gate
confining two dimensional electrons in a quantum well into artificial minima
arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The sublattice symmetry breaking is generated
by forming an artificial triangular graphene quantum dot (ATGQD) with zigzag
edges. The resulting extended Hubbard model generates tunable ratio of
tunneling strength to electron-electron interactions and of sublattice symmetry
with control over shape. The validity of the simulator is confirmed for small
systems using mean-field and exact diagonalization many-body approaches which
show that the ground state changes from a metallic to an antiferromagnetic (AF)
phase by varying the distance between sites or depth of the confining
potential. The one-electron spectrum of these triangular dots contains a
macroscopically degenerate shell at the Fermi level. The shell persists at the
mean-field level for weak interactions (metallic phase) but disappears for
strong interactions, in the AF phase. We determine the effects of
electron-electron interactions on the ground state, the total spin, and the
excitation spectrum as a function of filling of the ATGQD. We find that the
half-filled charge neutral shell leads to a partially spin polarized state in
both metallic and AF regimes in accordance with Liebs theorem. In both regimes
a relatively large gap separates the spin polarized ground state to the first
excited many-body state at half filling of the degenerate shell. By adding or
removing an electron, this gap drops dramatically, and alternate total spin
states emerge with energies nearly degenerate to a spin polarized ground state.

has offered new solutions to problems in missing data and causal inference; yet
these advances have not leveraged modern semiparametric efficiency theory for
more robust and efficient uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we
consider the problem of obtaining distribution-free prediction regions
accounting for a shift in the distribution of the covariates between the
training and test data. Under an explainable covariate shift assumption
analogous to the standard missing at random assumption, we propose three
variants of a general framework to construct well-calibrated prediction regions
for the unobserved outcome in the test sample. Our approach is based on the
efficient influence function for the quantile of the unobserved outcome in the
test population combined with an arbitrary machine learning prediction
algorithm, without compromising asymptotic coverage. Next, we extend our
approach to account for departure from the explainable covariate shift
assumption in a semiparametric sensitivity analysis for potential latent
covariate shift. In all cases, we establish that the resulting prediction sets
eventually attain nominal average coverage in large samples. This guarantee is
a consequence of the product bias form of our proposal which implies correct
coverage if either the propensity score or the conditional distribution of the
response is estimated sufficiently well. Our results also provide a framework
for construction of doubly robust prediction sets of individual treatment
effects, under both unconfoundedness and allowing for some degree of unmeasured
confounding. Finally, we discuss aggregation of prediction sets from different
machine learning algorithms for optimal prediction and illustrate the
performance of our methods in both synthetic and real data.

next-generation electronic devices and have stimulated extensive interest in
condensed matter physics and material fields. However, how to realize
high-temperature ferromagnetism in two-dimensional materials remains a great
challenge in physics.
  Herein, we propose an effective approach that the dimerization of magnetic
ions in two-dimensional materials can enhance the exchange coupling and
stabilize the ferromagnetism.
  Manganese carbonitride Mn$_2$N$_6$C$_6$ with a planar monolayer structure is
taken as an example to clarify the method, in which two Mn atoms are gathered
together to form a ferromagnetic dimer of Mn atoms and further these dimers are
coupled together to form the overall ferromagnetism of the two-dimensional
material.
  In Mn$_2$N$_6$C$_6$ monolayer, the near-room-temperature ferromagnetism with
the Curie temperature of 272.3 K is determined by solving Heisenberg model
using Monte Carlo simulations method.

and an odd, excited, Majorana fermion state. The multiparticle sectors of $N$,
braided, indistinguishable Majorana fermions are constructed via first
quantization. The framework is that of a graded Hopf algebra endowed with a
braided tensor product. The Hopf algebra is ${U}({\mathfrak {gl}}(1|1))$, the
Universal Enveloping Algebra of the ${\mathfrak{gl}}(1|1)$ superalgebra. A
$4\times 4$ braiding matrix $B_t$ defines the braided tensor product. $B_t$,
which is related to the $R$-matrix of the Alexander-Conway polynomial, depends
on the braiding parameter $t$ belonging to the punctured plane ($t\in {\mathbb
C}^\ast$); the ordinary antisymmetry property of fermions is recovered for
$t=1$. For each $N$, the graded dimension $m|n$ of the graded multiparticle
Hilbert space is computed. Besides the generic case, truncations occur when $t$
coincides with certain roots of unity which appear as solutions of an ordered
set of polynomial equations. The roots of unity are organized into levels which
specify the maximal number of allowed braided Majorana fermions in a
multiparticle sector. By taking into account that the even/odd sectors in a
${\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Hilbert space are superselected, a nontrivial braiding
with $t\neq 1$ is essential to produce a nontrivial Hilbert space described by
qubits, qutrits, etc., since at $t=1$ the $N$-particle vacuum and the
antisymmetrized excited state encode the same information carried by a
classical $1$-bit.

matroid theory. However, the axiom gives only a local characterization of the
relation of bases, which is a major stumbling block to further progress, and
providing a global understanding of the structure of matroid bases is a
fundamental goal in matroid optimization.
  While studying the structure of symmetric exchanges, Gabow proposed the
problem that any pair of bases admits a sequence of symmetric exchanges. A
different extension of the exchange axiom was proposed by White, who
investigated the equivalence of compatible basis sequences. These conjectures
suggest that the family of bases of a matroid possesses much stronger
structural properties than we are aware of.
  In the present paper, we study the distance of basis pairs of a matroid in
terms of symmetric exchanges. In particular, we give a polynomial-time
algorithm that determines a shortest possible exchange sequence that transforms
a basis pair into another for split matroids, a class that was motivated by the
study of matroid polytopes from a tropical geometry point of view. As a
corollary, we verify the above mentioned long-standing conjectures for this
large class. Being a subclass of split matroids, our result settles the
conjectures for paving matroids as well.

handling of intercurrent events that occur after treatment initiation and
either preclude the observation of an event of interest or impact the
interpretation of the treatment effect. In the context of time to event

applied. We discuss a practical problem in clinical trial design and execution,
i.e. in some clinical contexts it is not feasible to systematically follow
patients to an event of interest. We discuss what censoring means in such

terminology to distinguish types of censoring. We provide recommendations for
trial design, stressing the need for close alignment of the clinical question
of interest and study design, impact on data collection and other practical
implications. We discuss the use of sensitivity and supplementary analyses to

$Ti_{9.5}Si_{90.5}$ alloy located very close to the critical point of the
metal-insulator transition. In the presence of a magnetic field, the specific
heat is dominated by the Schottky anomaly caused by magnetic moments associated
with the dangling bonds in the matrix of amorphous Si. Subtraction of this
contribution exposes the behavior of the electronic specific heat coefficient
$\gamma$. The coefficient is temperature-independent above 2 K and is, in order
of magnitude, close to the value expected in the absence of electron-electron
interactions. In the temperature range 0.4-1.5 K, the coefficient $\gamma$
shows an anomalous downturn, which can be approximated by the dependence
$\gamma\left(T\right)=\gamma_0ln{(T/T_0)}$, with $T_0\approx0.2$ K . In a
companion paper, we found that the Hall coefficient in Ti-Si alloys is affected
by the electron-electron interaction up to much higher temperature of 150 K and
also varies critically across the metal-insulator transition. We compare our
results with theoretical predictions for three models, which can potentially
explain the anomalous behavior of the specific heat: generalized non-linear
$\sigma$ model, Coulomb glass, and many-body localization.

noise under the CE loss. We propose a novel contrastive regularization function
to learn such representations over noisy data where label noise does not
dominate the representation learning. By theoretically investigating the
representations induced by the proposed regularization function, we reveal that
the learned representations keep information related to true labels and discard
information related to corrupted labels. Moreover, our theoretical results also
indicate that the learned representations are robust to the label noise. The
effectiveness of this method is demonstrated with experiments on benchmark

supernova remnants (SNRs). A valid detection had to correspond with known
X-ray, Halpha and radio emission from the SNRs. From the 24 known SNRs, we made
5 positive detections with another 5 possible detections. Two detections are
associated with pulsars or pulsar wind nebula, and another three detections are
part of the extended nebulous emission from the SNRs. We modelled dust emission
where fast moving electrons are predicted to collide and heat dust grains which
then radiate in IR. With known distance (62.44+-0.47kpc), measured SNR sizes,
electron densities, temperatures from X-ray emission as well as hydrogen
densities, the modelling of SMC SNRs is straightforward.
  If the higher range of hydrogen and electron densities were to be accepted,
we would expect almost all SMC SNRs to be detected in the IR, at least at 24
micron, but the actual detection rate is only 25%. One possible and common
explanation for this discrepancy is that small grains have been destroyed by
the SNRs shockwave. However, within the uncertainties of hydrogen and electron
densities, we find that infrared dust emission can be explained reasonably
well, without invoking dust destruction. There is no conclusive evidence that

de facto standard and attained immense success in medical image segmentation.
However, as a downside, CNN based methods are a double-edged sword as they fail
to build long-range dependencies and global context connections due to the
limited receptive field that stems from the intrinsic characteristics of the
convolution operation. Hence, recent articles have exploited Transformer
variants for medical image segmentation tasks which open up great opportunities
due to their innate capability of capturing long-range correlations through the
attention mechanism. Although being feasibly designed, most of the cohort
studies incur prohibitive performance in capturing local information, thereby
resulting in less lucidness of boundary areas. In this paper, we propose a
contextual attention network to tackle the aforementioned limitations. The
proposed method uses the strength of the Transformer module to model the
long-range contextual dependency. Simultaneously, it utilizes the CNN encoder
to capture local semantic information. In addition, an object-level
representation is included to model the regional interaction map. The extracted
hierarchical features are then fed to the contextual attention module to
adaptively recalibrate the representation space using the local information.
Then, they emphasize the informative regions while taking into account the
long-range contextual dependency derived by the Transformer module. We validate
our method on several large-scale public medical image segmentation datasets
and achieve state-of-the-art performance. We have provided the implementation

Initially, we compared two segmentation architectures, 3D-Unet and DenseVNet,

chose the 3D-Unet as the better performing model. We used the XCAT-trained
model to generate pseudo-labels for the CT-ORG dataset that has only 7 organs

the training set to have more quantity. Performance improved for segmentation
in the organs where we have true labels in both datasets and degraded when

improved Average DSC in XCAT and CT-ORG by 1. This demonstrates that quality

problems may need to rely on machine-generated noisy labels extracted from

general not robust to noisy-label samples, leading to sub-optimal models.
Furthermore, CXR datasets are mostly multi-label, so current noisy-label

this paper, we propose a new method designed for the noisy multi-label CXR

emission of this pulsar has been detected with changes of signal to noise
ratios hundreds of times. Part of the long-time flux density variability can be
explained by refractive scintillations in the interstellar medium. The
existence of radiation between the interpulse (IP) and main pulse (MP) was
confirmed. It was more powerful than at high frequencies. We detected the
unusual interpulse and precursor (Pr) radiation on August 1, 2017. On the base
of strong 65 interpulses we found the correlations between energies of IP and

the two-stage framework, which consists of Residual-Quantized VAE (RQ-VAE) and

represent the image as a stacked map of discrete codes. Then, RQ-Transformer

effect of stable stratification, which generally suppresses dynamo action. We
explore the effects of stable stratification on mean-field dynamo theory with a
particular focus on a non-helical large-scale dynamo (LSD) mechanism known as
the magnetic shear-current effect. We find that the mechanism is robust to
increasing stable stratification as long as the original requirements for its
operation are met: a source of shear and non-helical magnetic fluctuations
(e.g. from a small-scale dynamo). Both are plausibly sourced in the presence of
differential rotation. Our idealized direct numerical simulations, supported by
mean-field theory, demonstrate the generation of near equipartition large-scale
toroidal fields. Additionally, a scan over magnetic Reynolds number shows no
change in the growth or saturation of the LSD, providing good numerical
evidence of a dynamo mechanism resilient to catastrophic quenching, which has
been an issue for helical dynamos. These properties -- the absence of
catastrophic quenching and robustness to stable stratification -- make the
mechanism a plausible candidate for generating in-situ large-scale magnetic
fields in stellar radiative zones.

unsolved problems between these fields. It is established now based on many
astrophysical and cosmological observations that only a small fraction of the
total matter content of the universe is made of baryonic matter, while the vast
majority is constituted by dark matter. However, the nature of such a component
is still unknown. One theoretically well-motivated approach to understanding
the nature of dark matter would be through looking for light pseudo-scalar
candidates for dark matter such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs).
Axions are hypothetical elementary particles resulting from the Peccei-Quinn
(PQ) solution to the strong CP (charge-parity) problem in quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). Furthermore, many theoretically well-motivated extensions
to the standard model of particle physics (SMPP) predicted the existence of
more pseudo-scalar particles similar to the QCD axion and called ALPs. Axions
and ALPs are characterized by their coupling with two photons. While the
coupling parameter for axions is related to the axion mass, there is no direct
relation between the coupling parameter and the mass of ALPs. Nevertheless, it
is expected that ALPs share the same phenomenology of axions. In the past
years, axions and ALPs regained popularity and slowly became one of the most
appealing candidates that possibly contribute to the dark matter density of the
universe. In this thesis, we focus on studying the phenomenology of axions and
ALPs interactions with photons to constrain some of their properties.

exploration-exploitation dilemma. In this paper, we investigated the problem of
improving exploration in RL and introduced the intrinsically-motivated RL. In
sharp contrast to the classic exploration strategies, intrinsically-motivated
RL utilizes the intrinsic learning motivation to provide sustainable
exploration incentives. We carefully classified the existing intrinsic reward
methods and analyzed their practical drawbacks. Moreover, we proposed a new
intrinsic reward method via R\'enyi state entropy maximization, which overcomes
the drawbacks of the preceding methods and provides powerful exploration
incentives. Finally, extensive simulation demonstrated that the proposed module
achieve superior performance with higher efficiency and robustness.

example electrons) interacting with electromagnetic field is not known. The
well-known problem is that the standard Lorentz force alone (in the case of
point particles) does not lead to a theory in which momentum and energy are
conserved. The need of radiation reaction force (or self-force) thus arises.
The well known candidate for such force, the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac reaction
force, gives non-causal particle behavior, i.e., the particle starts to move
before the arrival of external electromagnetic fields. Alternative, causal
proposals provide non-physical behavior of the particle -- the particle moves
with non-zero acceleration long after any external forces acted on it. Below,
we question the existence of a causal theory. We show that for certain
electromagnetic pulse of radiation and point particle being initially at rest,
there {\it does not exists} a causal particle trajectory, such that the
particle ends up moving with constant velocity (when no external
electromagnetic fields act on it for very long time). This shows that the
proper, causal electrodynamics of point particles does not exist.

of writing SQL queries is often problematic for nontechnical end-users in the

confusing, especially for undergraduate students. One of the pivotal reasons
given for these difficulties lies with the simple syntax of SQL, which is often
misleading and hard to understand. An ideal solution is to present these two
audiences: undergraduate students and nontechnical end-users with learning and
practice tools. These tools are mostly electronic and can be used to aid their
understanding, as well as enable them to write correct SQL queries. This work
proposes a new approach aimed at understanding and writing correct SQL queries
using principles from Formal Language and Automata Theory. We present
algorithms based on: regular expressions for the recognition of simple query
constructs, context-free grammars for the recognition of nested queries, and a
jumping finite automaton for the synthesis of SQL queries from natural language
descriptions. As proof of concept, these algorithms were further implemented
into interactive software tools aimed at improving SQL comprehension.
Evaluation of these tools showed that the majority of participants agreed that
the tools were intuitive and aided their understanding of SQL queries. These
tools should, therefore, find applications in aiding SQL comprehension at

stable, and the final light intensity increases to the ideal value (0.9 Imax).
