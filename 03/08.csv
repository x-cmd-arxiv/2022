  This preprint will soon be submitted",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Synthetic data can be used in various applications, such as correcting bias
datasets or replacing scarce original data for simulation purposes. Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) are considered state-of-the-art for developing
generative models. However, these deep learning models are data-driven, and it
is, thus, difficult to control the generation process. It can, therefore, lead
to the following issues: lack of representativity in the generated data, the
introduction of bias, and the possibility of overfitting the sample's noise.
This article presents the Directed Acyclic Tabular GAN (DATGAN) to address
these limitations by integrating expert knowledge in deep learning models for
synthetic tabular data generation. This approach allows the interactions
between variables to be specified explicitly using a Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG). The DAG is then converted to a network of modified Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) cells to accept multiple inputs. Multiple DATGAN versions are
systematically tested on multiple assessment metrics. We show that the best
versions of the DATGAN outperform state-of-the-art generative models on
multiple case studies. Finally, we show how the DAG can create hypothetical
synthetic datasets.

functions in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ from holomorphic intrinsic functions of one
complex variable. This result was initially proved by Fueter and Sce for the
cases where the dimension $m$ is odd using pointwise differentiation, while the
extension to the cases where $m$ is even was proved by Qian using the
corresponding Fourier multipliers.
  In this paper, we provide an alternative description of the Fueter-Sce-Qian
theorem in terms of the generalized CK-extension. The latter characterizes
axial null solutions of the Cauchy-Riemann operator in $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ in
terms of their restrictions to the real line. This leads to a one-to-one
correspondence between the space of axially monogenic functions in
$\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$ and the space of analytic functions of one real variable.
  We provide explicit expressions for the Fueter-Sce-Qian map in terms of the
generalized CK-extension for both cases, $m$ even and $m$ odd. These
expressions allow for a plane wave decomposition of the Fueter-Sce-Qian map or,
more in particular, a factorization of this mapping in terms of the dual Radon
transform. In turn, this decomposition provides a new possibility for extending
the Coherent State Transform (CST) to Clifford Analysis. In particular, we
construct an axial CST defined through the Fueter-Sce-Qian mapping, and show
how it is related to the axial and slice CSTs already studied in the
literature.

that $\varphi$ admits a local equilibrium state on $H_\chi(p)$ if and only if
$\varphi$ is ""recurrent on $H_\chi(p)$"" (a condition tested by counting

set of positively recurrent hyperbolic points; and if an equilibrium measure
exists, the said invariant and absolutely continuous family of measures
constitutes as its conditional measures. An immediate corollary is the local
product structure of hyperbolic equilibrium states.
  Second, we prove a Ledrappier-Young property for hyperbolic equilibrium
states -- if $\varphi$ admits a conformal family of leaf measures, and a
hyperbolic local equilibrium state, then the leaf measures of the invariant
family (respective to $\varphi$) are equivalent to the conformal measures (on a
full measure set). This extends the celebrated result by Ledrappier and Young

alleviate this problem, we propose a weakly supervised 6D object pose

Specifically, we assign a set of arbitrarily chosen 3D keypoints to represent
each unknown target 3D object and learn a network to detect their 2D
projections that comply with the relative camera viewpoints. During inference,
our network first infers the 2D keypoints from the query image and a given

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable

is produced by a resonance, that occurs when electrons and phonons on the
topological surfaces have the same energy: this effectively increases the
electron-phonon interaction and hence the Cooper pair binding energy, thus
establishing an optimal condition for the superconducting phase. With this
mechanism, the $T_{c}$ can be increased by well over a factor two, and the
maximum enhancement occurs in the degenerate phononic flat-band limit.

dominated by inverse Compton up-scattering of cosmic microwave background
photons by the radio emitting relativistic electrons. For regions dominated by
high surface brightness emission, such as hot spots and jet knots, the implied
magnetic fields are $\sim 50~\mu$G to $70~\mu$G. The non-thermal pressure is
these brighter regions is then $\sim 9\times 10^{-10}$ dyne cm$^{-2}$, or three
times larger than the non-thermal pressure derived assuming minimum energy
conditions, and an order of magnitude larger than the thermal pressure in the
ambient cluster medium. Assuming ram pressure confinement implies an average
advance speed for the radio source of $\sim 2400$ km s$^{-1}$, and a source age
of $\sim 3\times 10^7$ years. Considering the lower surface brightness, diffuse
radio emitting regions, we identify an evacuated cavity in the Ly$\alpha$

and close to a minimum energy configuration. The radio morphology suggests that
the Spiderweb is a high-$z$ example of the rare class of hybrid morphology
radio sources (or HyMoRS), which we attribute to interaction with the
asymmetric gaseous environment indicated by the Ly$\alpha$ emission.

simple finite-dimensional Cartan type Lie superalgebras $W(n)$ as $n$ goes to

Grassmann algebra $\Lambda(n)$. The zeroth component of $W(\infty)$ in its
natural $\mathbb{Z}$-grading is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{gl}(\infty)$.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of the representation theory of
$W(\infty)$. We study $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $W(\infty)$-modules, and we introduce
a category $\mathbb{T}_W$ that is closely related to the Koszul category
$\mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{sl}(\infty)}$ of tensor $\mathfrak{sl}(\infty)$-modules
introduced and studied by Dan-Cohen, Serganova and Penkov. We classify the
simple objects of $\mathbb{T}_W$ (up to isomorphism). We prove that each simple
module in $\mathbb{T}_W$ is isomorphic to the unique simple quotient of a
module induced from a simple module in $\mathbb{T}_{\mathfrak{gl}(\infty)}$,
and vice versa, which is analogous to the case for $W(n)$ studied by Serganova.
As a corollary, we find that all simple modules in $\mathbb{T}_W$ are highest
weight modules with respect to a certain Borel subalgebra. We realize each
simple module from $\mathbb{T}_W$ as a module of tensor fields, generalizing
work of Bernstein and Leites for $W(n)$. We prove that the category
$\mathbb{T}_W$ has enough injective objects, and for each simple module, we
provide an explicit injective module in $\mathbb{T}_W$ that contains it.

be considered reproducible unless the algorithm fully specifies what should be
done with solutions generated outside the domain, even in the case of simple
box constraints. Currently, in the field of heuristic optimisation, such
specification is rarely mentioned or investigated due to the assumed triviality
or insignificance of this question. Here, we demonstrate that, at least in
algorithms based on Differential Evolution, this choice induces notably
different behaviours - in terms of performance, disruptiveness and population
diversity. This is shown theoretically (where possible) for standard
Differential Evolution in the absence of selection pressure and experimentally
for the standard and state-of-the-art Differential Evolution variants on
special test function $f_0$ and BBOB benchmarking suite, respectively.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the importance of this choice quickly grows with
problem's dimensionality. Different Evolution is not at all special in this
regard - there is no reason to presume that other heuristic optimisers are not
equally affected by the aforementioned algorithmic choice. Thus, we urge the
field of heuristic optimisation to formalise and adopt the idea of a new
algorithmic component in heuristic optimisers, which we call here a strategy of
dealing with infeasible solutions. This component needs to be consistently (a)
specified in algorithmic descriptions to guarantee reproducibility of results,
(b) studied to better understand its impact on algorithm's performance in a
wider sense and (c) included in the (automatic) algorithmic design. All of
these should be done even for problems with box constraints.

reflected inertia, and structural stiffness. High stiffness, large range of
motion with high force capability are achieved with the proposed mechanism,
which are in trade-off relationships in traditional haptic interfaces. The
device can apply up to 83 N continuously, which is three times larger than most

of the proposed mechanism were 1.3 to 1.9 times and 37 times of conventional

because its structural stiffness only depends on the timing belt stiffness,
while that of conventional haptic interfaces is inversely proportional to the
cube of structural lengths. The modular actuator design enables change of

to clutter and partial observations, allowing to extract a clean, abstract

tested in several real-world publicly-available cluttered maps obtained in

to the combination of clutter removal and robust room segmentation ROSE^2
consistently achieves higher performance than the state-of-the-art methods,

distinctly different individual trajectory shapes. Most precision medicine
approaches using longitudinal data often ignore information from the
longitudinal data structure. This paper investigates a powerful precision
medicine approach by examining the impact of baseline covariates on
longitudinal outcome trajectories to guide treatment decisions instead of
traditional scalar outcome measures derived from longitudinal data, such as a

the origin of the charge density wave (CDW) order, how does the

will be significantly weakened together with the CDW order. Combining with our
density functional calculations, we interpret these effects by an antiphase
shift of the Fermi energy with respect to the saddle points near M and the
Fermi surface centered around {\Gamma}. It is found that the former depletes
the filled states for the CDW instability and worsens the nesting condition for

In this paper, we present the spectroscopic and imaging observations of
small-scale transients and subsequent formation of transient loops. For the
purpose, we have utilized the multi-wavelength observations recorded by AIA and
IRIS-SJI, along with spectroscopic measurements provided by IRIS. For the
photospheric magnetic field data, we obtained line-of-sight magnetogram data
provided by HMI. Small-scale transients are simultaneously observed with
several EUV and UV passbands of AIA and IRIS-SJI. HMI magnetogram provides
evidence of negative flux cancellations beneath these transients. Differential
Emission Measure (DEM) analysis shows that one of the transient attains
temperature up to 8 MK whereas another one reaches only up to 0.4 MK. These
transients further lead to the formation of small-scale loops with similar
temperature distributions, and thus termed as hot and cool loops respectively.
During the course of events, IRIS slit was rastering the region and thus
provided spectroscopic measurements at both transients and associated loops.
This enabled us to perform in-depth investigations of hot and cool loops. Using
density sensitive O IV line pair, we obtained average electron densities along
the hot and cool loop to be $10^{11.2}$ and $10^{10.8}$ cm$^{-3}$ respectively.
Energy estimates suggest that flux cancellation can easily power the hot
transient whereas is insufficient for cool transient. Life time estimates and
magnetic field extrapolation suggest presence of small-scale and fine
structures within these loops. Results provide crucial ingredients on the
physics of loop formation and involved thermodynamics.

applications. However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for
example, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and
general framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change
distributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our
procedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length
(frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian
or sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay
following a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called
an \emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental
generalization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at
consecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style
e-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve
both statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be
instantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric
problems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many
nonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of
detecting changes in the mean of a bounded random variable without i.i.d.
assumptions, with an application to tracking the performance of a basketball
team over multiple seasons.

dominated scrambling through Krylov complexity and the associated Lanczos

demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients follow the linear growth, which

learning useful policies in the presence of other simultaneously learning
agents whose changing behaviors jointly affect the environment's transition and

this non-stationarity is for each agent to anticipate the learning of other
agents and influence the evolution of future policies towards desirable
behavior for its own benefit. Unfortunately, previous approaches for achieving
this suffer from myopic evaluation, considering only a finite number of policy
updates. As such, these methods can only influence transient future policies
rather than achieving the promise of scalable equilibrium selection approaches
that influence the behavior at convergence. In this paper, we propose a
principled framework for considering the limiting policies of other agents as
time approaches infinity. Specifically, we develop a new optimization objective
that maximizes each agent's average reward by directly accounting for the
impact of its behavior on the limiting set of policies that other agents will
converge to. Our paper characterizes desirable solution concepts within this

(GWs) in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. They are expected to
emit quasi-monochromatic, long-duration GW signals, called continuous waves
(CWs), due to their deviations from spherical symmetry. The degree of such
deformations, and hence the information about the internal structure of a NS,
is encoded in a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon$ called ellipticity.
Searches for CW signals from isolated Galactic NSs have shown to be sensitive
to ellipticities as low as $\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-9})$. These
searches are optimal for detecting and characterising GWs from individual NSs,
but they are not designed to measure the properties of NSs as population, such
as the average ellipticity $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{av}}$. These ensemble
properties can be determined by the measurement of the stochastic
gravitational-wave background (SGWB) arising from the superposition of GW
signals from individually-undetectable NSs. In this work, we perform a
cross-correlation search for such a SGWB using the data from the first three
observation runs of Advanced LIGO and Virgo. Finding no evidence for a SGWB
signal, we set upper limits on the dimensionless energy density parameter
$\Omega_{\mathrm{gw}}(f)$. Using these results, we also constrain the average
ellipticity of Galactic NSs and five NS ``hotspots'', as a function of the
number of NSs emitting GWs within the frequency band of the search

(that is, ODE systems in the state-space form). However, if one observes the
state of the system only partially, the observed quantities (outputs) and the
inputs of the system can typically be related by more complicated
differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Therefore, a natural question
(referred to as the realizability problem) is: given a differential-algebraic
equation (say, fitted from data), does it come from a partially observed
dynamical system? A special case in which the functions involved in the
dynamical system are rational is of particular interest. For a single
differential-algebraic equation in a single output variable, Forsman has shown
that it is realizable by a rational dynamical system if and only if the
corresponding hypersurface is unirational, and he turned this into an algorithm
in the first-order case.
  In this paper, we study a more general case of single-input-single-output

can lead to radio emissions produced from this process and could be observed by
the forthcoming radio telescopes. In this work, we investigate the

  Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integrating different representations from complementary sensing modalities
is crucial for robust scene interpretation in autonomous driving. While deep
learning architectures that fuse vision and range data for 2D object detection
have thrived in recent years, the corresponding modalities can degrade in
adverse weather or lighting conditions, ultimately leading to a drop in
performance. Although domain adaptation methods attempt to bridge the domain
gap between source and target domains, they do not readily extend to
heterogeneous data distributions. In this work, we propose an unsupervised
domain adaptation framework, which adapts a 2D object detector for RGB and
lidar sensors to one or more target domains featuring adverse weather
conditions. Our proposed approach consists of three components. First, a data
augmentation scheme that simulates weather distortions is devised to add domain
confusion and prevent overfitting on the source data. Second, to promote
cross-domain foreground object alignment, we leverage the complementary
features of multiple modalities through a multi-scale entropy-weighted domain
discriminator. Finally, we use carefully designed pretext tasks to learn a more
robust representation of the target domain data. Experiments performed on the
DENSE dataset show that our method can substantially alleviate the domain gap
under the single-target domain adaptation (STDA) setting and the less explored
yet more general multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA) setting.

ML based plans were generated for each patient on both CT and MR imaging using
a commercially available model in RayStation 8B. The dose distributions and
acceptance rates of MR and CT based plans were compared using institutional
dose-volume evaluation criteria. The dosimetric differences between MR and CT

all evaluation criteria except for the bladder wall, penile bulb, small and

One such species is VO, which is prominent in stellar M-dwarf spectra. Evidence
for VO has been found in the low-resolution transmission spectrum of WASP-121b,
but this has not been confirmed at high resolution. It has been suggested that
this is due to inaccuracies in its line list. In this paper, we quantitatively
evaluate the VO line list and assess whether inaccuracies are responsible for
the non-detections at high resolution in WASP-121b. Furthermore, we investigate
whether the detectability can be improved by selecting only those lines
associated with the most accurate quantum transitions. A cross-correlation
analysis was applied to archival HARPS and CARMENES spectra of several M
dwarfs. VO cross-correlation signals from the spectra were compared with those
in which synthetic VO models were injected, providing an estimate of the ratio
between the potential strength (in case of a perfect model) and the observed
strength of the signal. This was repeated for the reduced model covering the
most accurate quantum transitions. The findings were fed into injection and
recovery tests of VO in a UVES transmission spectrum of WASP-121b. We find that
inaccuracies cause VO cross-correlation signals in M-dwarf spectra to be
suppressed by about a factor 2.1 and 1.1 for the complete and reduced line
lists, respectively, corresponding to a reduced observing efficiency of a
factor 4.3 and 1.2. The reduced line list outperforms the complete line list in
recovering the actual VO signal in the M-dwarf spectra by about a factor of
1.8. Neither line list results in a VO detection in WASP-121b. Injection tests
show that with the reduced efficiency of the line lists, the potential signal
as seen at low resolution is not detectable in these data.

indeed, that these approaches underperform due to the erroneous uncertainty

reachability-based methods are more precise in detecting manoeuvres. Then, to
inherit the best properties of both classes of algorithms, a manoeuvre
detection filter that combines both concepts is finally presented. Manoeuvre
detection results are presented first for simulated scenarios -- for validation
and calibration purposes -- and later for real data. Radar information comes
from the Spanish Space Surveillance Radar (S3TSR), with real manoeuvre
information and high-quality ephemerides. The results show promise, taking into
account that a single surveillance radar is the only source of data, obtaining
manoeuvre detection rates of more than 50% and false positive rates of less
than 10%.

reveal the selection sectors and hence the corresponding symmetry. The algebra
of those transparent patch operators in $n$-dimensional space gives rise to a
non-degenerate braided fusion $n$-category, which happens to describe a
topological order in one higher dimension (for finite symmetry). Such a
holographic theory not only describes (higher) symmetries, it also describes

Thus, topological order in one higher dimension, replacing group, provides a
unified and systematic description of the above generalized symmetries. This is
referred to symmetry/topological-order (Symm/TO) correspondence. Our approach
also leads to a derivation of topological holographic principle: \emph{boundary

rates calculated based on their infection and recovery rates. Next, we
characterize the average difference when the test measurements are erroneous
(i.e., noisy). Further, we consider the case where the infection status of
individuals may be dependent, which happens when an infected person spreads the
disease to another person if they are not detected and isolated by the health
care provider. Then, we consider an age of incorrect information based error
metric where the staleness metric increases linearly over time as long as the
health care provider does not detect the changes in the infection status of the

increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates which

past three years. Compared with other deep learning modalities,
high-performance hardware acceleration of GCNs is as critical but even more
challenging. The hurdles arise from the poor data locality and redundant
computation due to the large size, high sparsity, and irregular non-zero
distribution of real-world graphs.
  In this paper we propose a novel hardware accelerator for GCN inference,
called I-GCN, that significantly improves data locality and reduces unnecessary
computation. The mechanism is a new online graph restructuring algorithm we
refer to as islandization. The proposed algorithm finds clusters of nodes with
strong internal but weak external connections. The islandization process yields
two major benefits. First, by processing islands rather than individual nodes,
there is better on-chip data reuse and fewer off-chip memory accesses. Second,
there is less redundant computation as aggregation for common/shared neighbors
in an island can be reused. The parallel search, identification, and leverage
of graph islands are all handled purely in hardware at runtime working in an
incremental pipeline. This is done without any preprocessing of the graph data
or adjustment of the GCN model structure.
  Experimental results show that I-GCN can significantly reduce off-chip
accesses and prune 38% of aggregation operations, leading to performance
speedups over CPUs, GPUs, the prior art GCN accelerators of 5549x, 403x, and
5.7x on average, respectively.

interact with it. This contact is a vital source of information for
understanding 3D humans, 3D scenes, and the interactions between them. In fact,
we demonstrate that these human-scene interactions (HSIs) can be leveraged to
improve the 3D reconstruction of a scene from a monocular RGB video. Our key
idea is that, as a person moves through a scene and interacts with it, we
accumulate HSIs across multiple input images, and optimize the 3D scene to
reconstruct a consistent, physically plausible and functional 3D scene layout.
Our optimization-based approach exploits three types of HSI constraints: (1)
humans that move in a scene are occluded or occlude objects, thus, defining the
depth ordering of the objects, (2) humans move through free space and do not
interpenetrate objects, (3) when humans and objects are in contact, the contact
surfaces occupy the same place in space. Using these constraints in an
optimization formulation across all observations, we significantly improve the
3D scene layout reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that our scene

the descriptor matching speed, and the 3D model size, by at least an order of

clearing by an unseen planet within the gap, and derive the planet mass using
Wisdom overlap or Hill radius arguments. However, this approach can be invalid
if the disc is massive, because this clearing would also cause planet
migration. This could result in a calculated planet mass that is incompatible
with the inferred disc mass, because the predicted planet would in reality be
too small to carve the gap without significant migration. We investigate the
gap that a single embedded planet would carve in a massive debris disc. We show
that a degeneracy is introduced, whereby an observed gap could be carved by two
different planets: either a high-mass, barely-migrating planet, or a smaller
planet that clears debris as it migrates. We find that, depending on disc mass,
there is a minimum possible gap width that an embedded planet could carve
(because smaller planets, rather than carving a smaller gap, would actually
migrate through the disc and clear a wider region). We provide simple formulae
for the planet-to-debris disc mass ratio at which planet migration becomes
important, the gap width that an embedded planet would carve in a massive
debris disc, and the interaction timescale. We also apply our results to
various systems, and in particular show that the disc of HD 107146 can be
reasonably well-reproduced with a migrating, embedded planet. Finally, we
discuss the importance of planet-debris disc interactions as a tool for
constraining debris disc masses.

gamma-ray data to simulate the CTA performance in detecting these sources. In
the way, we propose a test to discriminate between the two CR models,
quantifying the statistical confidence at which one model can be preferred over
the other. We point out that current data already give a slight preference to
CR models which are dominated by advection in their nucleus. Moreover, we show
that CTA will allow us to firmly disfavour models dominated by diffusion over
self-induced turbulence, compared to advection-dominated models, with Bayes
factors which can be as large as $10^7$ for some of the SBGs. Finally, we
estimate the diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes of SFGs and SBGs, showing
that they can explain $25\%$ of the diffuse HESE data, while remaining

compared to thousands of field stars in the disc and the bulge of the Milky

within about 1.5 sigma from the average for the field stars with a similar
metallicity, and they are in perfect agreement for Zn (31 stars), claimed to be
the most sensitive element concerning the accretion pattern. Moreover, the
chemo-dynamical plots, coupled to the bifurcated age-metallicity relation of

constraints derived from Subaru data, we perform a lensing mass reconstruction
in a free-form manner, which allows us to determine both radial structure and
2D morphology of the cluster mass distribution. In a triaxial framework
assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White density profile, we constrain the intrinsic
structure and geometry of the cluster halo by forward modeling the
reconstructed mass map. We obtain a halo mass $M_{200}=(1.54 \pm 0.29)\times
10^{15}h^{-1}M_\odot$, a halo concentration $c_{200}=5.27 \pm 1.28$, and a
minor-major axis ratio $q_a=0.62 \pm 0.23$ with uninformative priors. Using a
prior on the line-of-sight alignment of the halo major axis derived from binary
merger simulations constrained by multi-probe observations, we find that the
data favor a more prolate geometry with lower mass and lower concentration.
From triaxial lens modeling with the line-of-sight prior, we find a spherically
enclosed gas mass fraction of $f_\mathrm{gas}=(8.4 \pm 1.0)\%$ at $0.7h^{-1}$

stellar masses in the range $10^{9.5}$ to $10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We find that the
changes in internal structures within 1$R_{\rm e}$ are correlated with the
total stellar mass of the individual galaxies. The majority of the galaxies in
the sample ($73\% \pm 3\%$) are oblate, while $19\% \pm 3\%$ are mildly
triaxial and $8\% \pm 2\%$ have triaxial/prolate shape. Galaxies with $\log

dark matter fraction of $f_{\rm{DM}} = 0.28 \pm 0.20$, within 1$R_{\rm e}$.
Galaxies with higher intrinsic ellipticity (flatter) are found to have more
negative velocity anisotropy $\beta_r$ (tangential anisotropy). $\beta_r$ also
shows an anti-correlation with the edge-on spin parameter \lam, so that
$\beta_r$ decreases with increasing \lam. We see evidence of an increasing
fraction of hot orbits with increasing stellar mass, while warm and cold orbits
show a decreasing trend. We also find that galaxies with different ($V/\sigma$

fast-rotating galaxies form through two main channels.

of first-generation mergers retained in their host environments;
first-generation black holes are born with a maximum mass that is compatible

sensing applications by harnessing up to room-temperature quantum coherence.
Challenged by the requirement of designing local coherent drives and improving
sensitivity to various signals for such applications, the search of hybrid
systems coupling QI spins with matter excitations have garnered significant
recent interest. We propose and theoretically study a hybrid system that
couples spin-1 QI with the dynamical excitations of nanomagnets, which are
controlled by mechanisms uncovered in classical spintronics. We show that in
such systems the QI-spin decoherence, due to coupling to thermally excited
modes of the nanomagnet, can be designed across a wide range by exploiting the
control over nanomagnet's mode ellipticity and the chiral nature of the
coupling between the QI spin and nanomagnet. On the other hand, when activated
electrically via voltage-induced torques, we demonstrate that QI spins can be
driven coherently with large quality factors at room temperature by leveraging
inherent non-linear precessional modes of the nanomagnet. Our results provide
theoretical guidance for enabling unique quantum spintronic functionalities,
such as local coherent driving of QI spins up to ambient conditions, and the
design of nanomagnet-enhanced QI-based hybrid sensors.

stars at the time of their formation, across 11 simulated Milky Way (MW)- and
M31-mass galaxies in the FIRE-2 simulations, to inform initial conditions for
chemical tagging. The overall scatter in [Fe/H] within a galaxy decreased with
time until $\approx 7$ Gyr ago, after which it increased to today: this arises
from a competition between a reduction of azimuthal scatter and a steepening of
the radial gradient in abundance over time. The radial gradient is generally
negative, and it steepened over time from an initially flat gradient $\gtrsim
12$ Gyr ago. The strength of the present-day abundance gradient does not
correlate with when the disk `settled'; instead, it best correlates with the
radial velocity dispersion within the galaxy. The strength of azimuthal
variation is nearly independent of radius, and the 360 degree scatter decreased
over time, from $\lesssim 0.17$ dex at $t_{\rm lb} = 11.6$ Gyr to $\sim 0.04$
dex at present day. Consequently, stars at $t_{\rm lb} \gtrsim 8$ Gyr formed in
a disk with primarily azimuthal scatter in abundances. All stars formed in a
vertically homogeneous disk, $\Delta$[Fe/H] $\leq 0.02$ dex within $1$ kpc of
the galactic midplane, with the exception of the young stars in the inner
$\approx 4$ kpc at $z \sim 0$. These results generally agree with our previous
analysis of gas-phase elemental abundances, which reinforces the importance of
cosmological disk evolution and azimuthal scatter in the context of stellar
chemical tagging. We provide analytic fits to our results for use in
chemical-tagging analyses.

$n$-particle amplitudes become non-perturbative in the limit where $n$ scales
with energy. In this case, the effective expansion parameter, $\lambda n$, is
no longer small and the perturbative approach breaks down. In general, the
associated $n$-particle production rates were argued to be described by an
exponential that, depending on the specifics of the underlying Quantum Field
Theory model, could be either growing or decaying in the large-$n$ regime. We
investigate such processes in general settings of Effective Field Theory (EFT),
involving arbitrary higher-dimensional operators of $\varphi$. We perform the
resummation of all leading loop corrections arising from EFT vertices for
amplitudes at the multiparticle threshold. We find that the net effect of
higher-dimensional operators amounts to an exponentially growing factor. We
show that if an exponential growth was already generated by the renormalizable

objects (YSOs), as tracers of star formation. Observations of molecular clouds
at visible, infrared, radio and X-ray wavelengths can identify and characterize
the YSOs populating these clouds, with the ability to detect deeply embedded
objects and all evolutionary stages. Surveys with the Spitzer, Herschel,
XMM-Newton and Chandra space telescopes have measured the spatial distribution
of YSOs within a number of nearby (< 2.5 kpc) molecular clouds, showing surface
densities varying by more than three orders of magnitude. These surveys have
been used to measure the spatially varying star formation rates and
efficiencies within clouds, and when combined with maps of the molecular gas,
have led to the discovery of star-forming relations within clouds. YSO surveys
can also characterize the structures, ages, and star formation histories of
embedded clusters, and they illuminate the relationship of the clusters to the
networks of filaments, hubs and ridges in the molecular clouds from which they
form. Measurements of the proper motions and radial velocities of YSOs trace
the evolving kinematics of clusters from the deeply embedded phases through gas
dispersal, providing insights into the factors that shape the formation of
bound clusters. On 100 pc scales that encompass entire star-forming complexes,
Gaia is mapping the young associations of stars that have dispersed their natal
gas and exist alongside molecular clouds. These surveys reveal the complex
structures and motions in associations, and show evidence for supernova driven
expansions. Remnants of these associations have now been identified by Gaia,
showing that traces of star-forming structures can persist for a few hundred
million years.

ultraviolet galaxy Y002 at $z=7.677$, spectroscopically confirmed by its
ionized carbon [CII] 158$\mu$m emission line. The Ly$\alpha$ line is spatially
associated with the rest-frame UV stellar emission ($M_{\rm UV}$~-22, 2x
brighter than $M^\star_{\rm UV}$) and it appears offset from the peak of the
extended [CII] emission at the current ~1"" spatial resolution. We derive an
estimate of the unobscured SFR(UV)=$(22\pm1)\,M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and set an
upper limit of SFR(IR)$<15\,M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ from the far-infrared wavelength
range, which globally place Y002 on the SFR(UV+IR)-L([CII]) correlation
observed at lower redshifts. In terms of velocity, the peak of the Ly$\alpha$
emission is redshifted by $\Delta v$(Ly$\alpha$)~500 km s$^{-1}$ from the
systemic redshift set by [CII] and a high-velocity tail extends to up to ~1000
km s$^{-1}$. The velocity offset is up to ~3.5x higher than the average
estimate for similarly UV-bright emitters at z~6-7, which might suggest that we
are witnessing the merging of two clumps. A combination of strong outflows and
the possible presence of an extended ionized bubble surrounding Y002 would
likely facilitate the escape of copious Ly$\alpha$ light, as indicated by the
large equivalent width EW(Ly$\alpha$)=$24^{+5}_{-6}$ \r{A}. Assuming that [CII]
traces the neutral hydrogen, we estimate a HI gas fraction of $M({\rm
HI})/M_\star\gtrsim8$ for Y002 as a system and speculate that patches of high
HI column densities could contribute to explain the observed spatial offsets
between Ly$\alpha$ and [CII] emitting regions. The low dust content, implied by
the non-detection of the far-infrared continuum emission at rest-frame ~160
$\mu$m, would be sufficient to absorb any potential Ly$\alpha$ photons produced
within the [CII] clump as a result of large HI column densities.

infra-red-luminous quasars that have been previously studied in their 1mm dust
continuum and [CII] line emission. We detect CO(7-6) at various degrees of
significance in all the targeted sources, thus doubling the number of such

with a modified black body spectrum with a dust temperature $T_{dust}$~47 K and
an optical depth $\tau_{\nu}$=0.2 at the [CII] frequency. Our study provides us
with four independent ways to estimate the molecular gas mass, $M_{H2}$, in the
targeted quasars. This allows us to set constraints on various parameters used
in the derivation of molecular gas mass estimates, such as the mass per
luminosity ratios $\alpha_{CO}$ and $\alpha_{[CII]}$, the gas-to-dust ratio
$\delta_{g/d}$, and the carbon abundance [C]/H2. Leveraging either on the dust,
CO, [CI], or [CII] emission yields mass estimates of the entire sample in the

Gaia} Early Data Release 3 to detect the likely unresolved double white dwarfs
(DWDs). Using parallax-based distances we convert the excess of reduced
$\chi^2$ into the amplitude of the centroid wobble $\delta a$, which is
proportional to the binary separation $a$. The measured $\delta a$ distribution
drops towards larger wobble amplitudes and shows a break around $\delta a
\approx 0.2$ where it steepens. The integral of the distribution yields DWD
fraction of $6.5 \pm 3.7$ per cent in the range $0.01 < a (\text{au}) < 2$.
Using synthetic models of the Galactic DWDs we demonstrate that the break in
the $\delta a$ distribution corresponds to one side of a deep gap in the DWD
separation distribution at around $a\approx 1$ au. Model DWDs with separations
less than several au shrink dramatically due to (al least one) common envelope
phase, reshaping the original separation distribution, clearing a gap and
creating a pile-up of systems with $a\approx 0.01$ au and $\delta a < 0.01$.
Our models reproduce the overall shape of the observed $\delta a$ distribution
and its normalisation, however the predicted drop in the numbers of DWDs beyond
the break is steeper than in the data.

  Graphs","Full version of SoCG '22 paper",,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We initiate the study of diameter computation in geometric intersection
graphs from the fine-grained complexity perspective. A geometric intersection
graph is a graph whose vertices correspond to some shapes in $d$-dimensional
Euclidean space, such as balls, segments, or hypercubes, and whose edges
correspond to pairs of intersecting shapes. The diameter of a graph is the
largest distance realized by a pair of vertices in the graph.
  Computing the diameter in near-quadratic time is possible in several classes
of intersection graphs [Chan and Skrepetos 2019], but it is not at all clear if
these algorithms are optimal, especially since in the related class of planar
graphs the diameter can be computed in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{5/3})$ time
[Cabello 2019, Gawrychowski et al. 2021].
  In this work we (conditionally) rule out sub-quadratic algorithms in several
classes of intersection graphs, i.e., algorithms of running time
$\mathcal{O}(n^{2-\delta})$ for some $\delta>0$. In particular, there are no
sub-quadratic algorithms already for fat objects in small dimensions: unit
balls in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or congruent equilateral triangles in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
For unit segments and congruent equilateral triangles, we can even rule out
strong sub-quadratic approximations already in $\mathbb{R}^2$. It seems that
the hardness of approximation may also depend on dimensionality: for
axis-parallel unit hypercubes in~$\mathbb{R}^{12}$, distinguishing between
diameter 2 and 3 needs quadratic time (ruling out $(3/2-\varepsilon)$-
approximations), whereas for axis-parallel unit squares, we give an algorithm
that distinguishes between diameter $2$ and $3$ in near-linear time.
  Note that many of our lower bounds match the best known algorithms up to
sub-polynomial factors.

spinor fields evolving in general FRW spacetimes. We quantify these
fluctuations by the noise kernel of spinor fields. For the particular case of
de Sitter spacetime, we place the spinor field in what is called the fermionic
Bunch Davies vacuum and study the variation of the noise kernel with the mass
of the field. We then make use of the conformal invariance of massless spinor
fields and employ an equivalence that relates a massless spinor field in any
given FRW spacetime with a corresponding massless spinor field in de Sitter
spacetime. Using this equivalence, we study the behaviour of the noise kernel
of massless spinor fields in general FRW spacetimes while placing the fields in
the Bunch Davies vacuum of the corresponding massless spinor field of the de
Sitter spacetime. We extend this analysis to the coordinate invariant quantity
of the energy energy correlator. We compare these results for spinor fields in
considered spacetimes with the analogous results for scalar fields. This study
helps us better understand whether the spin 1/2 fermionic matter remains
strongly correlated in considered spacetimes leading to considerable
backreaction or not.

instabilities can take place at high energies, leading to the formation of
scalarized neutron stars. Depending on the theory parameters, stars in a
scalarized state can form a solution-space branch that shares a lot of
similarities with the so-called mass twins in general relativity appearing for
equations of state containing first-order phase transitions. Members of this
scalarized branch have a lower maximum mass and central energy density compared
to Einstein ones. In such cases, a scalarized star could potentially
over-accrete beyond the critical mass limit, thus triggering a gravitational
phase transition where the star sheds its scalar hair and migrates over to its
non-scalarized counterpart. Such an event resembles, though is distinct from, a
nuclear or thermodynamic phase transition. We dynamically track a gravitational
transition by first constructing hydrostatic, scalarized equilibria for
realistic equations of state, and then allowing additional material to fall
onto the stellar surface. The resulting bursts of monopolar radiation are

not be practical. Thus, there is much interest in using machine learning to
yield the redshift from the photometry of each object. We are particularly
interested in radio sources (quasars) detected with the Square Kilometre Array
and have found Deep Learning, trained upon a large optically-selected sample of
quasi-stellar objects, to be effective in the prediction of the redshifts in
three external samples of radio-selected sources. However, the requirement of
nine different magnitudes, from the near-infrared, optical and ultra-violet
bands, has the effect of significantly reducing the number of sources for which
redshifts can be predicted. Here we explore the possibility of using machine
learning to impute the missing features. We find that for the training sample,
simple imputation is sufficient, particularly replacing the missing magnitude
with the maximum for that band, thus presuming that the non-detection is at the
sensitivity limit. For the test samples, however, this does not perform as well
as multivariate imputation, which suggests that many of the missing magnitudes
are not limits, but have indeed not been observed. From extensive testing of
the models, we suggest that the imputation is best restricted to two missing
values per source. Where the sources overlap on the sky, in the worst case,
this increases the fraction of sources for which redshifts can be estimated
from 46% to 80%, with >90% being reached for the other samples.

galaxy physics, the chemical evolution of matter and the absorption and
re-emission of stellar light. The last years have seen a surge in observational
and theoretical studies constraining the dust-abundance of galaxies up to
$z\sim5$. In this work we gather the latest observational measurements (with a
focus on absorption studies covering metallicities in the range $6.8 < 12 +
\log{(O/H)}<9$) and theoretical predictions (from six different galaxy
formation models) for the dust-to-gas (DTG) and dust-to-metal (DTM) ratio of
galaxies. The observed trend between DTG and DTM and gas-phase metallicity can
be described by a linear relation and shows no evolution from $0<z<5$.
Importantly, the fit to the DTG-metallicity relation provides a refined tool
for robust dust-based gas mass estimates inferred from millimeter
dust-continuum observations. The lack of evolution in the observed relations
are indicative of a quickly reached balance (already when the Universe was 1.2
Gyr old) between the formation and destruction of dust and a constant timescale
for star-formation at fixed metallicities over cosmic time. None of the models
is able to reproduce the observed trends over the entire range in metallicity
and redshift probed. The comparison between models and simulations furthermore
rules out some of the current implementations for the growth and destruction of
dust in galaxy formation models and places tight constraints on the predicted
timescale for star-formation.

well on vision tasks, it is often impractical to use them on green, edge, or
desktop computing due to their computational requirements for training and even
testing. We present WaveMix as an alternative neural architecture that uses a
multi-scale 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for spatial token mixing.
Unlike ViTs, WaveMix neither unrolls the image nor requires self-attention of
quadratic complexity. Additionally, DWT introduces another inductive bias --
besides convolutional filtering -- to utilize the 2D structure of an image to
improve generalization. The multi-scale nature of the DWT also reduces the
requirement for a deeper architecture compared to the CNNs, as the latter
relies on pooling for partial spatial mixing. WaveMix models show
generalization that is competitive with ViTs, CNNs, and token mixers on several
datasets while requiring lower GPU RAM (training and testing), number of
computations, and storage. WaveMix have achieved State-of-the-art (SOTA)
results in EMNIST Byclass and EMNIST Balanced datasets.

basis of countless graph theoretic and optimization problem. We study the
minimum spanning tree (MST) perturbation problem where the goal is to spend a
fixed budget to increase the weight of edges in order to increase the weight of
the MST as much as possible. Two popular models of perturbation are bulk and
continuous. In the bulk model, the weight of any edge can be increased exactly
once to some predetermined weight. In the continuous model, one can pay a
fractional amount of cost to increase the weight of any edge by a proportional
amount. Frederickson and Solis-Oba \cite{FS96} have studied these two models
and showed that bulk perturbation for MST is as hard as the $k$-cut problem
while the continuous perturbation model is solvable in poly-time. In this
paper, we study an intermediate unit perturbation variation of this problem
where the weight of each edge can be increased many times but at an integral
unit amount every time. We provide an $(opt/2 -1)$-approximation in polynomial
time where $opt$ is the optimal increase in the weight. We also study the
associated dual targeted version of the problem where the goal is to increase
the weight of the MST by a target amount while minimizing the cost of
perturbation. We provide a $2$-approximation for this variation. Furthermore we
show that assuming the Small Set Expansion Hypothesis, both problems are hard
to approximate. We also point out an error in the proof provided by
Frederickson and Solis-Oba in \cite{FS96} with regard to their solution to the

suitable for helicopter take-off in mid air. For given aeroshell dimensions,
only MAHD's lander-free approach leaves enough room in the aeroshell to
accommodate the largest rotor option for MSH. This drastically improves flight
performance, notably allowing +150\% increased science payload mass. Compared
to heritage EDL approaches, the simpler MAHD architecture is also likely to
reduce cost, and enables access to more hazardous and higher-elevation terrains
on Mars. This paper introduces a design for the MAHD system architecture and
operations. We present a mechanical configuration that fits both MSH and the
jetpack within the 2.65-m Mars heritage aeroshell, and a jetpack control
architecture which fully leverages the available helicopter avionics. We
discuss preliminary numerical models of the flow dynamics resulting from the
interaction between the jets, the rotors and the side winds. We define a

We investigate the K-shell features of Ne, CO$_2$, and SF$_6$ gases, by
measuring their photo ion-yield spectra at the BESSY II synchrotron facility
simultaneously with the 1s-np fluorescence emission of He-like ions produced in
the Polar-X EBIT. Accurate ab initio calculations of transitions in these ions
provide the basis of the calibration. While the CO$_2$ result agrees well with
previous measurements, the SF$_6$ spectrum appears shifted by ~0.5 eV, about
twice the uncertainty of the earlier results. Our result for Ne shows a large
departure from earlier results, but may suffer from larger systematic effects
than our other measurements. The molecular spectra agree well with our results
of time-dependent density functional theory. We find that the statistical
uncertainty allows calibrations in the desired range of 1-10 meV, however,
systematic contributions still limit the uncertainty to ~40-100 meV, mainly due
to the temporal stability of the monochromator energy scale. Combining our
absolute calibration technique with a relative energy calibration technique
such as photoelectron energy spectroscopy will be necessary to realize its full
potential of achieving uncertainties as low as 1-10 meV.

at predicting answers given samples from the question and image modalities.
Most recent methods focus on learning a good joint embedding space of images

modalities, or by making it a more discriminant space. However, how informative
this joint space is, has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose a
novel regularization for VQA models, Constrained Optimization using Barlow's
theory (COB), that improves the information content of the joint space by
minimizing the redundancy. It reduces the correlation between the learned
feature components and thereby disentangles semantic concepts. Our model also
aligns the joint space with the answer embedding space, where we consider the
answer and image+question as two different `views' of what in essence is the
same semantic information. We propose a constrained optimization policy to
balance the categorical and redundancy minimization forces. When built on the
state-of-the-art GGE model, the resulting model improves VQA accuracy by 1.4%

where potentially manipulated data arrives in an online manner and decisions
are made sequentially. The excellent performance of the Poincar\'e second-order

approach to find an $\varepsilon$-approximation of the OT distance. Our
algorithm achieves a near-optimal execution time of $O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ for
computing OT distance and, for the special case of the assignment problem, the
execution time improves to $O(n^2/\varepsilon)$. Our algorithm is based on the
push-relabel framework for min-cost flow problems.
  Unlike the other combinatorial approach (Lahn, Mulchandani and Raghvendra,
NeurIPS 2019) which does not have a fast parallel implementation, our algorithm
has a parallel execution time of $O(\log n/\varepsilon^2)$. Interestingly,
unlike the Sinkhorn algorithm, our method also readily provides a compact
transport plan as well as a solution to an approximate version of the dual
formulation of the OT problem, both of which have numerous applications in
Machine Learning. For the assignment problem, we provide both a CPU

one warped, with the warp due to misaligned gas inflow, and the other unwarped.
We find slow, retrograde bending waves in both models, with the ones in the
warped model having larger amplitudes. We also find fast, prograde bending
waves. Prograde bending waves in the unwarped model are very weak, in agreement
with the expectation that these waves should decay on short, ~ crossing,
timescales, due to strong winding. However, prograde bending waves are much
stronger for the duration of the warped model, pointing to irregular gas inflow
along the warp as a continuous source of excitation. We demonstrate that large
amplitude bending waves that propagate through the Solar Neighbourhood give
rise to a correlation between the mean vertical velocity and the angular
momentum, with a slope consistent with that found by Gaia. The bending waves
affect populations of all ages, but the sharpest features are found in the
young populations, hinting that short wavelength waves are not supported by the
older, kinematically hotter, populations. Our results demonstrate the

this paper presents Direct LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (DLIO), a lightweight
LiDAR-inertial odometry algorithm with a new coarse-to-fine approach in
constructing continuous-time trajectories for precise motion correction. The
key to our method lies in the construction of a set of analytical equations
which are parameterized solely by time, enabling fast and parallelizable
point-wise deskewing. This method is feasible only because of the strong
convergence properties in our nonlinear geometric observer, which provides
provably correct state estimates for initializing the sensitive IMU integration
step. Moreover, by simultaneously performing motion correction and prior
generation, and by directly registering each scan to the map and bypassing
scan-to-scan, DLIO's condensed architecture is nearly 20% more computationally
efficient than the current state-of-the-art with a 12% increase in accuracy. We
demonstrate DLIO's superior localization accuracy, map quality, and lower

exhibit a range of biases, most of them between -1.0 m/s and +0.2 m/s with

consistent with, yet sharper than, a more traditional paired comparison

to predicting the evolution of landscapes. Presently, however, no physically
based model reliably captures the dependence of basic river properties, such as
its shape or slope, on the discharge of sediment, even in the simple case of
laboratory rivers. Here, we show how the balance between fluid stress and
gravity acting on the sediment grains, along with cross-stream diffusion of
sediment, determines the shape and sediment flux profile of laminar laboratory
rivers which carry sediment as bedload. Using this model, which reliably
reproduces the experiments without any tuning, we confirm the hypothesis,
originally proposed by Parker (1978), that rivers are restricted to exist close
to the threshold of sediment motion (within about 20%). This limit is set by
the fluid-sediment interaction and is independent of the water and sediment
load carried by the river. Thus, as the total sediment discharge increases, the
intensity of sediment flux (sediment discharge per unit width) in a river
saturates, and the river can only transport more sediment by widening. In this
large discharge regime, the cross-stream diffusion of momentum in the flow
permits sediment transport. Conversely, in the weak transport regime, the
transported sediment concentrates around the river center without significantly
altering the river shape. If this theory holds for natural rivers, the aspect
ratio of a river could become a proxy for sediment discharge - a quantity
notoriously difficult to measure in the field.

increases its reflectivity (albedo), and provides a source of meltwater for
melt ponds during summer that decrease the ice's albedo. In this paper, we
develop a simple model of pre-melt snow topography that accurately describes
snow cover of flat, undeformed Arctic sea ice on several study sites for which

generalizes the ""void model"" of Popovi\'c et al. (2018) and, as such,

  Perturbations via Bayesian Self-supervision","The paper is accepted by AAAI 2022",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, plentiful evidence illustrates that Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) achieve extraordinary accomplishments on the node
classification task. However, GCNs may be vulnerable to adversarial attacks on
label-scarce dynamic graphs. Many existing works aim to strengthen the
robustness of GCNs; for instance, adversarial training is used to shield GCNs
against malicious perturbations. However, these works fail on dynamic graphs
for which label scarcity is a pressing issue. To overcome label scarcity,
self-training attempts to iteratively assign pseudo-labels to highly confident
unlabeled nodes but such attempts may suffer serious degradation under dynamic
graph perturbations. In this paper, we generalize noisy supervision as a kind
of self-supervised learning method and then propose a novel Bayesian
self-supervision model, namely GraphSS, to address the issue. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GraphSS can not only affirmatively alert the
perturbations on dynamic graphs but also effectively recover the prediction of
a node classifier when the graph is under such perturbations. These two
advantages prove to be generalized over three classic GCNs across five public
graph datasets.

increasing the stress required for dislocation glide. The gliding dislocations
experience significant hardening due to pinning and depinning caused by random

signal samples arises in various applications. This work addresses such a task
subject to a zero-delay response; that is, the smooth signal must be
reconstructed sequentially as soon as a data sample is available and without
having access to subsequent data. State-of-the-art approaches solve this
problem by interpolating consecutive data samples using splines. Here, each
interpolation step yields a piece that ensures a smooth signal reconstruction
while minimizing a cost metric, typically a weighted sum between the squared
residual and a derivative-based measure of smoothness. As a result, a
zero-delay interpolation is achieved in exchange for an almost certainly higher
cumulative cost as compared to interpolating all data samples together. This
paper presents a novel approach to further reduce this cumulative cost on
average. First, we formulate a zero-delay smoothing spline interpolation
problem from a sequential decision-making perspective, allowing us to model the
future impact of each interpolated piece on the average cumulative cost. Then,
an interpolation method is proposed to exploit the temporal dependencies
between the streamed data samples. Our method is assisted by a recurrent neural
network and accordingly trained to reduce the accumulated cost on average over
a set of example data samples collected from the same signal source generating
the signal to be reconstructed. Finally, we present extensive experimental
results for synthetic and real data showing how our approach outperforms the
abovementioned state-of-the-art.

the electronic thermal conductivity, are computed within first-principles

that the electron-phonon coupling factor and electronic specific heat play a
critical role in Frenkel pairs formation. Specifically, the electron-phonon
coupling factor quickly dissipates the kinetic energy during primary knock-on
atom events via plasmon excitations and is subsequently dissipated via the
free-electrons conduction. We show that these effects are more critical than
the elastic distortion effects produced by the atomic mismatch. Of tremendous

Mpc) and 2021inl in the outskirts of elliptical galaxy NGC 4923 (D = 80 Mpc),
both monitored through the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) transient survey.
The multi-color light curves of both SNe show two peaks, the former peak being
derived from shock cooling emission (SCE) and/or shock interaction with
circumstellar material (CSM). The primary peak in SN 2021gno is coincident with
luminous, rapidly decaying X-ray emission ($L_x = 5 \times 10^{41}$ erg
s$^{-1}$) detected by Swift-XRT at $\delta t = 1$ day after explosion, this
observation being the second ever detection of X-rays from a calcium-strong
transient. We interpret the X-ray emission from SN 2021gno in the context of
shock interaction with dense CSM that extends to $r < 3 \times 10^{14}$ cm.
Based on modeling of the SN 2021gno X-ray spectrum, we calculate a CSM mass
range of $M_{\rm CSM} = (0.3 - 1.6) \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and particle
densities of $n = (1-4) \times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Radio non-detections of SN
2021gno indicate a low-density environment at larger radii ($r > 10^{16}$ cm)
and a progenitor mass loss rate of $\dot{M} < 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$,
for $v_w = 500$ km s$^{-1}$. For radiation derived from SCE, modeling of the
primary light curve peak in both SNe indicates an extended progenitor envelope
mass and radius of $M_e = 0.02 - 0.05$ M$_{\odot}$ and $R_e = 30 - 230$
R$_{\odot}$. The explosion properties of SNe 2021gno and 2021inl suggest
progenitor systems containing either a low-mass massive star or a white dwarf
(WD), the former being unlikely for either object given the lack of star
formation at both explosion sites. Furthermore, the progenitor environments of
both SNe are consistent with explosion models for low-mass hybrid He/C/O WD +
C/O WD binaries.

in determining the impedance. One of the most important aspects which influence
the performance of an impedance cytometer performance is the microchannel
design. In this work, in the first step, the microchannel was designed in a way
to have the best detection in the impedance cytometer. In this regard,
hydrodynamic focusing was selected to focus the population of cells entering
from the inlet of the main channel. To find the optimal parameters of the

sensor data from Internet of Things (IoT) systems, the research community has
worked to reduce the computational and resource demands of DNN to compute on
low-resourced microcontrollers (MCUs). However, most of the current work in
embedded deep learning focuses on solving a single task efficiently, while the
multi-tasking nature and applications of IoT devices demand systems that can
handle a diverse range of tasks (activity, voice, and context recognition) with
input from a variety of sensors, simultaneously.
  In this paper, we propose YONO, a product quantization (PQ) based approach
that compresses multiple heterogeneous models and enables in-memory model
execution and switching for dissimilar multi-task learning on MCUs. We first
adopt PQ to learn codebooks that store weights of different models. Also, we
propose a novel network optimization and heuristics to maximize the compression
rate and minimize the accuracy loss. Then, we develop an online component of
YONO for efficient model execution and switching between multiple tasks on an
MCU at run time without relying on an external storage device.
  YONO shows remarkable performance as it can compress multiple heterogeneous
models with negligible or no loss of accuracy up to 12.37$\times$. Besides,
YONO's online component enables an efficient execution (latency of 16-159 ms
per operation) and reduces model loading/switching latency and energy
consumption by 93.3-94.5% and 93.9-95.0%, respectively, compared to external
storage access. Interestingly, YONO can compress various architectures trained
with datasets that were not shown during YONO's offline codebook learning phase
showing the generalizability of our method. To summarize, YONO shows great
potential and opens further doors to enable multi-task learning systems on
extremely resource-constrained devices.

Unlike MLS that hides secret data by slightly modifying a given text without
impairing the meaning of the text, GLS uses a trained language model to
directly generate a text carrying secret data. A common disadvantage for MLS
methods is that the embedding payload is very low, whose return is well
preserving the semantic quality of the text. In contrast, GLS allows the data
hider to embed a high payload, which has to pay the high price of
uncontrollable semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel LS method to modify
a given text by pivoting it between two different languages and embed secret

Omnidirectional and directional path loss with two antenna polarization

within seconds. Yet, the mechanism is not clear and existing explanations fail
by several orders of magnitude. In this paper, we analyze the effect of fluid
viscosity and particle size on SAW-driven collective particle dynamics in
droplets. In most of our experiments, the particles do not aggregate but
instead remain away from the droplet center, thereby forming ""black holes"". We
show that the black holes are due to steric hindrance wherein the poloidal
streamlines that should drive particles to the center of the droplet come too
close to the solid, so that the particles carried along these streamlines touch
the solid wall on the edge of the black hole before reaching the center of the
droplet. The size of these black holes is correlated with the size of the
aggregates formed in less viscous droplets. This suggests a common formation
mechanism for black holes and white dwarfs (aggregates). In the former, the
particles touching the solid would be washed away by the fluid, whereas in the
latter the particles would remain in contact with the solid and roll to the
center of the droplet where an aggregate is formed. We also discuss the
stability conditions of the aggregate at the bottom of the droplet. The concept
of hydrodynamic shielding is then used to concentrate 1 $\mu$m particles using
10 $\mu$m beads as shields.

large-scale, multi-domain, edit-intention annotated corpus of iteratively

comprehensively model the iterative text revisions that generalize to various

When we incorporate our annotated edit intentions, both generative and
edit-based text revision models significantly improve automatic evaluations.
Through our work, we better understand the text revision process, making vital
connections between edit intentions and writing quality, enabling the creation
of diverse corpora to support computational modeling of iterative text

technique with sub-nanosecond accuracy. However, asymmetric delay attack is a
serious threat which cannot be prevent by any encryption method. In this paper,
a dynamic model based scheme is proposed to defense the sub-nanosecond
asymmetric delay attack. A threshold is set according to the estimated time
difference by a two-state clock model where the fixed frequency difference is
excluded from the time difference to detect the asymmetric delay attack which
is smaller than the time difference induced by the fixed frequency difference.
Theoretical simulation and experimental demonstration are implemented to prove
the feasibility of the scheme. A two-way fiber-optic time transfer system with
time stability with 24.5ps, 3.98ps, and 2.95ps at 1s, 10s, and 100s averaging

demand for high-throughput optical fiber communication (OFC) systems to perform
massive data transmission and processing. Existing OFC methods mainly rely on
electronic circuits for data processing, which severely limits the
communication throughput. Though considered promising for the next-generation
high-speed fiber communication, all-optical OFC remains unachievable due to
serious challenges in effective optical computing, system modeling and
configuring. Here we propose an end-to-end photonic encoder-decoder (PED)
processor which maps the physical system of OFC into an optical generative
neural network. By modeling the OFC transmission process as the variation in
the constructed optical latent space, the PED learns noise-resistant coding
schemes via unsupervised optimization. With multi-layer parametric diffractive
neural networks, the PED establishes a large-scale and high-throughput optical
computing framework that integrates the main OFC computations including coding,
encryption and compression to the optical domain. The whole system improves the
latency of computation in OFC systems by five orders of magnitude compared with
the state-of-the-art device. On benchmarking datasets, the PED experimentally
achieves up to 32% reduction in transmission error ratio (ER) than on-off
keying (OOK), one of the mainstream methods with the lowest ER in general
transmission. As we demonstrate on medical data, the PED increases the
transmission throughput by two orders of magnitude than 8-level pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM-8). We believe the proposed photonic encoder-decoder processor

necessarily scales with one of the data matrix constants (typically the

nonnegative least squares problems with nonnegative data are solvable to
multiplicative error and with complexity that is independent of any matrix

Then, the most probable trajectory of the tracked target is computed via
dynamic programming in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. The proposed
method uses a Bayesian estimation framework which is neither limited to
Gaussian noise models nor requires a linearized target motion model or sensor
measurement models. However, an HMM-based approach to localization can suffer
from poor computational complexity in scenarios where the number of hidden
states increases due to high-resolution modeling or target localization in a
large space. To improve this poor computational complexity, this paper proposes
a belief propagation in the most probable belief space with a low to

favoring a soft ionizing continuum scenario for WLQs, and we find a lack of

attention-grabbed, and can be easily noticed by humans. In this paper, we study
a new type of optical adversarial examples, in which the perturbations are
generated by a very common natural phenomenon, shadow, to achieve naturalistic
and stealthy physical-world adversarial attack under the black-box setting. We
extensively evaluate the effectiveness of this new attack on both simulated and
real-world environments. Experimental results on traffic sign recognition
demonstrate that our algorithm can generate adversarial examples effectively,
reaching 98.23% and 90.47% success rates on LISA and GTSRB test sets
respectively, while continuously misleading a moving camera over 95% of the
time in real-world scenarios. We also offer discussions about the limitations
and the defense mechanism of this attack.

Essentially, the CLS task is the combination of machine translation (MT) and
monolingual summarization (MS), and thus there exists the hierarchical
relationship between MT\&MS and CLS. Existing studies on CLS mainly focus on
utilizing pipeline methods or jointly training an end-to-end model through an
auxiliary MT or MS objective. However, it is very challenging for the model to
directly conduct CLS as it requires both the abilities to translate and
summarize. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical model for the CLS
task, based on the conditional variational auto-encoder. The hierarchical model
contains two kinds of latent variables at the local and global levels,
respectively. At the local level, there are two latent variables, one for
translation and the other for summarization. As for the global level, there is
another latent variable for cross-lingual summarization conditioned on the two
local-level variables. Experiments on two language directions (English-Chinese)
verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. In addition,
we show that our model is able to generate better cross-lingual summaries than

our CF-ViT implements network inference in a two-stage manner. At coarse

a computationally economical classification. If not well recognized, the
informative patches are identified and further re-split in a fine-grained

naturally curved, shell-like colloidal particles gives rise to self-limiting
assembly of finite-sized stacks that far exceed particle dimensions. When
inter-particle adhesions favor conformal stacking, particle shape requires {\it
curvature focussing} in the stack, leading to a super-extensive accumulation of
bending costs that ultimately limit the ground-state stack size to a finite
value. Using a combination of continuum theory and particle-based simulation,
we demonstrate that the self-limiting stack size is controlled by the ratio of
the intra-particle bending costs to inter-particle adhesion energy, ultimately
achieving assembly sizes that are tuned from a few, up to several tens of,
particles. We show that the range of self-limiting assembly is delimited by the
two structural modes of ""frustration escape"" which evade the thermodynamic
costs of curvature focussing. Crucially, each of these modes can be suppressed
through suitable choice of adhesive range and lateral patchiness of adhesion,
providing feasible strategies to program finite assembly size via the interplay

  Weakly-Supervised Query-based Video Grounding",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Query-based video grounding is an important yet challenging task in video
understanding, which aims to localize the target segment in an untrimmed video
according to a sentence query. Most previous works achieve significant progress
by addressing this task in a fully-supervised manner with segment-level labels,
which require high labeling cost. Although some recent efforts develop
weakly-supervised methods that only need the video-level knowledge, they
generally match multiple pre-defined segment proposals with query and select
the best one, which lacks fine-grained frame-level details for distinguishing
frames with high repeatability and similarity within the entire video. To
alleviate the above limitations, we propose a self-contrastive learning
framework to address the query-based video grounding task under a
weakly-supervised setting. Firstly, instead of utilizing redundant segment
proposals, we propose a new grounding scheme that learns frame-wise matching
scores referring to the query semantic to predict the possible foreground
frames by only using the video-level annotations. Secondly, since some
predicted frames (i.e., boundary frames) are relatively coarse and exhibit
similar appearance to their adjacent frames, we propose a coarse-to-fine
contrastive learning paradigm to learn more discriminative frame-wise
representations for distinguishing the false positive frames. In particular, we
iteratively explore multi-scale hard negative samples that are close to
positive samples in the representation space for distinguishing fine-grained
frame-wise details, thus enforcing more accurate segment grounding. Extensive
experiments on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

positive real roots of a parametrized polynomial system. Here, we introduce a

chemical reaction network. Through explicit examples, we show that the
Newton-Okounkov body bound of a network gives a good upper bound on its maximum

counterpart, these interactions are generally of a weaker order of strength,
creating modest twisting in the spin structure which results in weak
ferromagntism or weak linear ME effect. Our proposed two-sublattice model, in

ferrimagnetic behavior with a considerably high magnetization $\textbf{M}$
coexisting with a ferroelectric (FE) order with an electric polarization
$\textbf{P}$ and a strong cross coupling between them which is primarily driven

the coupling between these microscopic interactions and the FE primary order

  Networks","ECCV2022",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Light-weight super-resolution (SR) models have received considerable
attention for their serviceability in mobile devices. Many efforts employ
network quantization to compress SR models. However, these methods suffer from
severe performance degradation when quantizing the SR models to ultra-low
precision (e.g., 2-bit and 3-bit) with the low-cost layer-wise quantizer. In
this paper, we identify that the performance drop comes from the contradiction
between the layer-wise symmetric quantizer and the highly asymmetric activation
distribution in SR models. This discrepancy leads to either a waste on the
quantization levels or detail loss in reconstructed images. Therefore, we
propose a novel activation quantizer, referred to as Dynamic Dual Trainable
Bounds (DDTB), to accommodate the asymmetry of the activations. Specifically,
DDTB innovates in: 1) A layer-wise quantizer with trainable upper and lower
bounds to tackle the highly asymmetric activations. 2) A dynamic gate
controller to adaptively adjust the upper and lower bounds at runtime to
overcome the drastically varying activation ranges over different samples.To
reduce the extra overhead, the dynamic gate controller is quantized to 2-bit
and applied to only part of the SR networks according to the introduced dynamic
intensity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DDTB exhibits significant
performance improvements in ultra-low precision. For example, our DDTB achieves
a 0.70dB PSNR increase on Urban100 benchmark when quantizing EDSR to 2-bit and
scaling up output images to x4. Code is at

Yukawa couplings to SM fermions are present. We explore the resulting novel

topic of considerable interest in theoretical ecology. Dispersal is known to
promote both synchrony, which enhances the likelihood of extinction, and
spatial heterogeneity, which favors the persistence of the population. Several
efforts have been made to understand the effect of diverse variants of
dispersal in the spatially distributed ecological community. Despite the
environmental change strongly affect the dispersal, the effects of controlled
dispersal on the metacommunity stability and their persistence remain unknown.
We study the influence of limiting the immigration using two patch
prey-predator metacommunity at both local and spatial scales. We find that the
spread of the inhomogeneous stable steady states (asynchronous states)
decreases monotonically upon limiting the predator dispersal. Nevertheless, at
the local scale, the spread of the inhomogeneous steady states increases up to
a critical value of the limiting factor, favoring the metacommunity
persistence, and then starts decreasing for further decrease in the limiting
factor with varying local interaction. Interestingly, limiting the prey
dispersal promotes inhomogeneous steady states in a large region of the
parameter space, thereby increasing the metacommunity persistence both at
spatial and local scales. Further, we show similar qualitative dynamics in an
entire class of complex networks consisting of a large number of patches. We
also deduce various bifurcation curves and stability condition for the
inhomogeneous steady states, which we find to agree well with the simulation
results. Thus, our findings on the effect of the limiting dispersal can help to

pixel-level localization maps obtained from a classifier. However, training on
class labels only, classifiers suffer from the spurious correlation between
foreground and background cues (e.g. train and rail), fundamentally bounding
the performance of WSSS. There have been previous endeavors to address this
issue with additional supervision. We propose a novel source of information to
distinguish foreground from the background: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data, or
images devoid of foreground object classes. In particular, we utilize the hard
OoDs that the classifier is likely to make false-positive predictions. These
samples typically carry key visual features on the background (e.g. rail) that
the classifiers often confuse as foreground (e.g. train), so these cues let
classifiers correctly suppress spurious background cues. Acquiring such hard
OoDs does not require an extensive amount of annotation efforts; it only incurs
a few additional image-level labeling costs on top of the original efforts to
collect class labels. We propose a method, W-OoD, for utilizing the hard OoDs.
W-OoD achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC 2012.

solving a multi-objective optimization problem that maximizes reflection power

the problem, we propose a constant-modulus power iteration method, which is
proven to be monotonically increasing, to maximize the objective function in
each iteration. Numerical results show that the proposed APSK constellation

manifestly define the basis where all averages can be explicitly calculated.
For example, in the Gaussian Hermitian and rectangular complex models, averages
of the Schur functions are again expressed through the Schur functions.
However, so far this property remains restricted to very particular (e.g.
Gaussian) measures. In this paper, we extend this observation to unitary matrix
integrals, where one could expect that this restriction is easier to lift. We
demonstrate that this is indeed the case, only this time the Schur averages are
linear combinations of the Schur functions. Full factorization to a single item
in the sum appears only on the Miwa locus, where at least one half of the
time-variables is expressed through matrices of the same size. For unitary
integrals, this is a manifestation of the de Wit-t'Hooft anomaly, which
prevents the answer to be fully analytic in the matrix size $N$. Once achieved,
this understanding can be extended back to the Hermitian model, where the
phenomenon looks very similar: beyond Gaussian measures superintegrability
requires an additional summation.

characteristics of the 2DEG formed at the LaInO$_3$/BaSnO$_3$ interface by
including a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ layer. To do so, we examine how the
orientation of the ferroelectric polarization impacts density and confinement
of the 2DEG. We find that aligning the ferroelectric polarization toward
(outward) the LaInO$_3$/BaSnO$_3$ interface leads to an accumulation
(depletion) of the interfacial 2DEG. Varying its magnitude, we find a linear
effect on the 2DEG charge density that is confined within the BaSnO$_3$ side.
Analysis of the optimized geometries revels that inclusion of the BaTiO$_3$

which, in turn, enhances the 2DEG density. Thicker ferroelectric layers allow
for reaching higher polarization magnitudes. We discuss the mechanisms behind
all these findings and rationalize how the characteristics of both 2DEG and 2D

the highly confident predictions as the pseudo ground-truth, but it leads to a
problem that most pixels may be left unused due to their unreliability. We
argue that every pixel matters to the model training, even its prediction is

confident about the pixel not belonging to the remaining classes. Hence, such a

sufficient use of unlabeled data. Concretely, we separate reliable and
unreliable pixels via the entropy of predictions, push each unreliable pixel to
a category-wise queue that consists of negative samples, and manage to train
the model with all candidate pixels. Considering the training evolution, where
the prediction becomes more and more accurate, we adaptively adjust the
threshold for the reliable-unreliable partition. Experimental results on
various benchmarks and training settings demonstrate the superiority of our

in the 3D deep learning community. Most proposed methods either use rotation
invariant descriptors as inputs or try to design rotation equivariant networks.
However, robust models generated by these methods have limited performance
under clean aligned datasets due to modifications on the original classifiers
or input space. In this study, for the first time, we show that the rotation
robustness of point cloud classifiers can also be acquired via adversarial
training with better performance on both rotated and clean datasets.
Specifically, our proposed framework named ART-Point regards the rotation of
the point cloud as an attack and improves rotation robustness by training the
classifier on inputs with Adversarial RoTations. We contribute an axis-wise
rotation attack that uses back-propagated gradients of the pre-trained model to
effectively find the adversarial rotations. To avoid model over-fitting on
adversarial inputs, we construct rotation pools that leverage the
transferability of adversarial rotations among samples to increase the
diversity of training data. Moreover, we propose a fast one-step optimization
to efficiently reach the final robust model. Experiments show that our proposed
rotation attack achieves a high success rate and ART-Point can be used on most
existing classifiers to improve the rotation robustness while showing better
performance on clean datasets than state-of-the-art methods.

a unifying theory for wavelength-selection dynamics in (nearly) mass-conserving

At short wavelengths, self-amplifying mass transport between single pattern

break strict mass conservation lead to an arrest of the coarsening process. The
rate of mass competition between pattern domains is calculated analytically
using singular perturbation theory, and rationalized in terms of the underlying
physical processes. The resulting closed-form analytical expressions enable us
to quantitatively predict the coarsening dynamics and the final pattern

This paper proposes a novel approach to relative localization in multi-robot

active nodes (using time-of-flight for ranging estimation to other active
nodes) and passive nodes (using time-difference-of-arrival for estimating range
differences with respect to pairs of active nodes). We adaptively update UWB
roles based on the location of the robots with respect to the convex envelope
defined by active nodes, and introducing constraints in the form of
localization frequency and accuracy requirements. We demonstrate the
applicability of the proposed approach and show that the localization errors
remain comparable to fixed-role systems. Then, we show how the navigation of an
autonomous drone is affected by the changes in the localization system,
obtaining significantly better trajectory tracking accuracy than when relying
in passive localization only. Our results pave the way for UWB-based
localization in large-scale multi-robot deployments, for either relative

Unlike a conventional light pulse atom interferometer, the PSI can produce a
signal that corresponds to multi-axis rotation only, independent of
acceleration. In addition, it can be used to measure acceleration along one
direction, independent of rotation. Here, we describe a modified PSI that can
be used to measure multi-axis rotation and multi-axis acceleration.
Specifically, this type of PSI can be used to measure two-axes rotation around
the directions perpendicular to the light pulses, as well as the acceleration
in all three directions, with only one pair of Raman beams. Using two pairs of

show promising performance on diverse downstream tasks. However, the analysis
of learned embedding has not been explored well, and the transferability for
cross-modal tasks can be improved. This paper provides a perspective to
understand multi-modal embedding in terms of uniformity and alignment. We newly
find that the representation learned by multi-modal learning models such as
CLIP has two separated embedding spaces for each heterogeneous dataset with
less alignment. Besides, there are unexplored large intermediate areas between
the two modalities with less uniformity. As a result, lack of alignment and
uniformity might restrict the robustness and transferability of the
representation for the downstream task. To this end, we provide a new
end-to-end fine-tuning method for robust representation that encourages better
uniformity and alignment score. First, we propose a \textit{Geodesic
Multi-Modal Mixup} that mixes the representation of image and text to generate
the hard negative samples on the hyperspherical embedding space. Second, we
fine-tune the multi-modal model on hard negative samples as well as normal
negatives and positive samples with contrastive loss. Through extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and structure-awareness task, we
demonstrate that our geodesic multi-modal Mixup learns a robust representation
and provides improved performance on various downstream tasks.

wide range of applications in machine learning. This problem in the special
case of matrix sensing has been studied extensively through the notion of
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), leading to a wealth of results on the
geometric landscape of the problem and the convergence rate of common
algorithms. However, the existing results can handle the problem in the case
with a general objective function subject to noisy data only when the RIP
constant is close to 0. In this paper, we develop a new mathematical framework
to solve the above-mentioned problem with a far less restrictive RIP constant.
We prove that as long as the RIP constant of the noiseless objective is less
than $1/3$, any spurious local solution of the noisy optimization problem must
be close to the ground truth solution. By working through the strict saddle
property, we also show that an approximate solution can be found in polynomial
time. We characterize the geometry of the spurious local minima of the problem
in a local region around the ground truth in the case when the RIP constant is
greater than $1/3$. Compared to the existing results in the literature, this

three-dimensional snap-through transition and an extremely large change in
frequency as a result. In this article, we address a unique characteristic of
these devices, in which a significant change in the DC conductance is also
observed at the mechanical snap-through transition. After verifying that the
change in the CNT tension due to the ""jump"" cannot account for the conductance
difference measured, we attribute the conductance ""jump"" to the change in
capacitance as a result of the snap-through buckling. However, we show that
quantitative analysis of this phenomenon is not at all trivial, and is enabled
only due to our ability to predict the exact CNT shape before and after the
transition. Understanding this mechanism enables a fast characterization of
fabricated devices and improves our understanding of their behavior, key in
developing this technology further and better design. As an example, we show
how the hysteretic trait of this phenomenon is indicative of the ability to

benefited various vision-language tasks by jointly learning visual and textual

However, these methods cannot well cope with OCR tasks because of the
difficulty in both instance-level text encoding and image-text pair acquisition
(i.e. images and captured texts in them). This paper presents a weakly
supervised pre-training method, oCLIP, which can acquire effective scene text
representations by jointly learning and aligning visual and textual
information. Our network consists of an image encoder and a character-aware
text encoder that extract visual and textual features, respectively, as well as
a visual-textual decoder that models the interaction among textual and visual

of textual features, the pre-trained model can attend texts in images well with
character awareness. Besides, these designs enable the learning from weakly
annotated texts (i.e. partial texts in images without text bounding boxes)
which mitigates the data annotation constraint greatly. Experiments over the
weakly annotated images in ICDAR2019-LSVT show that our pre-trained model

on a trivariate Edgeworth expansion truncated to non-Gaussian terms of lowest
order, to which Rice's formula is then applied. As an application, the effect
of level-upcrossing conditioning in second-order ocean waves is investigated.
Upcrossing events are monitored for the sea surface elevation. The conditional
distributions of different kinematic variables, given upcrossing, are
considered for different sea-state configurations. Predictions from the
analytical model are compared with numerical data obtained from Monte Carlo
experiments. It is found that the analytical approximation provides conditional
mean and variance in good agreement with numerical data, although moderate
discrepancies appear for the sea states with the most severe wave cambers.
Regarding the conditional skewness, given upcrossing, results are mixed, with
significant discrepancies between the analytical approximation and numerical

generated by a thermal gradient. The spin current generation depends on the
spin mixing conductance of the interface and the magnetic properties of the
ferromagnetic layer. Due to its low intrinsic damping, rare earth iron garnet
is often used for the ferromagnetic layer in the spin Seebeck experiment.
However, it is actually a ferrimagnetic with antiferromagnetically coupled
magnetic lattices and the contribution of rare earth magnetic lattice of rare
earth iron garnet on thermal spin pumping is not well understand. Here we focus
on the effect of magnetic properties of lanthanide and show that the orbital
angular momentum of rare earth iron garnet enhances thermal spin current
generation of lanthanide substituted yttrium iron garnet.

to the constant development of better policy gradient techniques. A precise
(low variance) and accurate (low bias) gradient estimator is crucial to face
increasingly complex tasks. Traditional policy gradient algorithms use the
likelihood-ratio trick, which is known to produce unbiased but high variance
estimates. More modern approaches exploit the reparametrization trick, which
gives lower variance gradient estimates but requires differentiable value
function approximators. In this work, we study a different type of stochastic
gradient estimator - the Measure-Valued Derivative. This estimator is unbiased,
has low variance, and can be used with differentiable and non-differentiable
function approximators. We empirically evaluate this estimator in the
actor-critic policy gradient setting and show that it can reach comparable
performance with methods based on the likelihood-ratio or reparametrization
tricks, both in low and high-dimensional action spaces. With this work, we want
to show that the Measure-Valued Derivative estimator can be a useful
alternative to other policy gradient estimators.

Movement Primitives (ProMPs) have shown to be a promising framework to learn
generalizable trajectory generators from distributions over demonstrated

the manipulation of objects, the accuracy of ProMPs is often insufficient, in
particular when they are learned in cartesian space from external observations

ProMPs with recently introduced Residual Reinforcement Learning (RRL), to
account for both, corrections in position and orientation during task
execution. In particular, we learn a residual on top of a nominal ProMP
trajectory with Soft-Actor Critic and incorporate the variability in the

successfully learns to complete the insertion which was not possible before

analysed in a perturbative way. In this work, we carry out the analysis by
expanding the dynamics of reputation to the second order of perturbation under
the assumption that everyone initially cooperates with good reputation. The
second-order theory clarifies the difference between Image Scoring and Simple
Standing in that punishment for defection against a well-reputed player should
be regarded as good for maintaining cooperation. Moreover, comparison among the
leading eight shows that the stabilizing effect of justified punishment weakens
if cooperation between two ill-reputed players is regarded as bad. Our analysis
thus explains how Simple Standing achieves a high level of stability by
permitting justified punishment and also by disregarding irrelevant information
in assessing cooperation. This observation suggests which factors affect the
stability of a social norm when reputation can be perturbed by noise.

this case is the Pareto set of efficient solutions. This is a problem much more
difficult than optimizing a single objective function. Moreover, obtaining the
Pareto set does not mean that the decision problem is solved since one or some

to determine the most preferred solution in the Pareto set, so that it is also
necessary to elicit the preferences of the user. In this perspective, what we
are proposing can be seen as the first structured methodology in facility
location problems to search optimal solutions taking into account preferences

generate a smooth real-time trajectory for navigation purposes, we fuse poses
from odometry and global matching by solving a pose graph optimization problem.

forward demands a semiclassical background with a sufficiently strong departure
from classical evolution. The latter condition is clearly satisfied by bouncing
models. We propose coherent states as the tool for introducing the
semiclassical universe. We solve the quantum dynamics of the perturbation modes
both analytically and numerically and investigate the amplitude spectra of the

In this paper a method that is based on the boundary element method in 3D
combined with a formulation for infinitely thin elements is presented. The
boundary integral equations for these elements are presented, and numerical
experiments are used to illustrate the behavior of the thin elements. Using the
example of a closed benchmark duct, boundary element solutions for thin
elements and surface elements are compared with the analytic solution, and the
accuracy of the boundary element method as function of element size is
investigated. As already shown for surface elements in the literature, an
accumulation of the error along the duct can also be found for thin elements,
but in contrast to surface elements this effect is not as big and a damping of
the amplitude cannot be seen. In a second experiment, the impedance at the open
end of a half open duct is compared with formulas for the radiation impedance
of an unflanged tube, and a good agreement is shown. Finally, resonance
frequencies of a tube open at both ends are calculated and compared with
measured spectra. For sufficiently small element sizes frequencies for lower
harmonics agree very well, for higher frequencies a difference of a few Hertz
can be observed, which may be explained by the fact that the method does not
consider dampening effects near the duct walls. The numerical experiments also
suggest, that for duct simulations the usual six to eight elements per
wavelength rule is not enough for accurate results.

Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC) proplyds. CI is expected to enable us to probe the
wind launching region of externally photoevaporating discs. Of the 8 targets
observed, no 3$\sigma$ detections of the CI line were made despite reaching
sensitivities deeper than the anticipated requirement for detection from prior
APEX CI observations of nearby discs and models of external photoevaporation of
quite massive discs. By comparing both the proplyd mass loss rates and CI flux
constraints with a large grid of external photoevaporation simulations, we
determine that the non-detections are in fact fully consistent with the models
if the proplyd discs are very low mass. Deeper observations in CI and probes of
the disc mass with other tracers (e.g. in the continuum and CO) can test this.
If such a test finds higher masses, this would imply carbon depletion in the
outer disc, as has been proposed for other discs with surprisingly low CI
fluxes, though more massive discs would also be incompatible with models that
can explain the observed mass loss rates and CI non-detections. The expected
remaining lifetimes of the proplyds are estimated to be similar to those of
proplyds in the ONC at 0.1Myr. Rapid destruction of discs is therefore also a
feature of common, intermediate UV environments.

that one query maybe attends to irrelevant keys/values. To address this issue,
we propose a Dynamic Group Attention (DG-Attention), which dynamically divides

self-interaction Jeans' length. The dynamics on the de Broglie scale become an
effective thermal energy in the hydrodynamic approximation, which is assumed to
be subdominant in the initial conditions, but become important as structures
collapse and the fluid is shock-heated. The halos that form have
Navarro-Frenk-White envelopes, while the centers become cored due to the fluid
pressures (thermal + self-interaction). The core radii are mostly determined by
the self-interaction Jeans' length, even though the effective thermal energy
eventually dominates over the self-interaction energy everywhere, a result that
is insensitive to the initial smallness of the thermal energy. Scaling
relations for the simulated population of halos are compared with Milky Way
dwarf spheroidals and nearby galaxies, assuming a Burkert halo profile, and are
found to not match, also for core radii $R_c\approx 1\text{kpc}$, which has
generally been the value expected to resolve the cusp-core issue. However, the
simulations have a limited volume, and therefore a limited halo mass range,
include no baryonic physics, and use fiducial cold dark matter initial

synchronizing the spins of solar-type close binary stars, but the mechanisms
responsible are not fully understood. Previous work has indicated that
significant enhancements to the theoretically-predicted tidal dissipation rates
are required to explain the observed circularization periods
($P_\mathrm{circ}$) in various stellar populations, and their evolution with
age. This was based partly on the common belief that the dominant mechanism of
tidal dissipation in solar-type stars is turbulent viscosity acting on
equilibrium tides in convective envelopes. In this paper we study tidal
dissipation in both convection and radiation zones of rotating solar-type stars
following their evolution. We study equilibrium tide dissipation, incorporating
a frequency-dependent effective viscosity motivated by the latest
hydrodynamical simulations, and inertial wave (dynamical tide) dissipation,
adopting a frequency-averaged formalism that accounts for the realistic
structure of the star. We demonstrate that the observed binary circularization
periods can be explained by inertial wave (dynamical tide) dissipation in
convective envelopes. This mechanism is particularly efficient during pre-main
sequence phases, but it also operates on the main sequence if the spin is close
to synchronism. The predicted $P_\mathrm{circ}$ due to this mechanism increases
with main-sequence age in accord with observations. We also demonstrate that
both equilibrium tide and internal gravity wave dissipation are unlikely to
explain the observed $P_\mathrm{circ}$, even during the pre-main sequence,
based on our best current understanding of these mechanisms. Finally, we
advocate more realistic dynamical studies of stellar populations that employ
tidal dissipation due to inertial waves.

challenging and critical task. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-spectral
image fusion method using a combination of the previously proposed 3D CNN model
VolumeNet and 2.5D texture transfer method using other modality high resolution
(HR) images. Since a multi-spectral (MS) image consists of several bands and
each band is a 2D image slice, MS images can be seen as 3D data. Thus, we use
the previously proposed VolumeNet to fuse HR panchromatic (PAN) images and
bicubic interpolated MS images. Because the proposed 3D VolumeNet can
effectively improve the accuracy by expanding the receptive field of the model,
and due to its lightweight structure, we can achieve better performance against
the existing method without purchasing a large number of remote sensing images
for training. In addition, VolumeNet can restore the high-frequency information
lost in the HR MR image as much as possible, reducing the difficulty of feature
extraction in the following step: 2.5D texture transfer. As one of the latest
technologies, deep learning-based texture transfer has been demonstrated to
effectively and efficiently improve the visual performance and quality
evaluation indicators of image reconstruction. Different from the texture
transfer processing of RGB image, we use HR PAN images as the reference images
and perform texture transfer for each frequency band of MS images, which is
named 2.5D texture transfer. The experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms the existing methods in terms of objective accuracy
assessment, method efficiency, and visual subjective evaluation.

works, for any positive integer $n$, assumptions have been formulated under
which the quadratic term induces a drift in the nonlinear dynamics, quantified
by the $H^{-n}$ norm of the control. This drift is an obstruction to the
small-time local controllability (STLC) under a smallness assumption on the
controls in regular spaces. In this paper, we prove that for controls small in
less regular spaces, the cubic term can recover the controllability lost at the
linear level, despite the quadratic drift. The proof is inspired by Sussman's
method to prove the sufficiency of the $\mathcal{S}(\theta)$ condition for STLC
of ODEs. However, it uses a different global strategy relying on a new concept
of tangent vector, better adapted to the infinite-dimensional setting of PDEs.
Given a target, we first realize the expected motion along the lost direction
by using control variations for which the cubic term dominates the quadratic
one. Then, we correct the other components exactly, by using a STLC in
projection result, with simultaneous estimates of weak norms of the control.
These estimates ensure that the new error along the lost direction is
negligible, and we conclude with the Brouwer fixed point theorem.

Gildener and Weinberg generalized the scale invariant standard model (SISM) by
including the multiplication of scalars in quartic forms. They pointed out that
along the flat direction only one scalar -- called the scalon -- is classically
massless and all other scalars are massive. Here we choose a SISM with one
scalon and one heavy scalar and extend that further respecting the scale
invariance by a vector-like lepton (VLL). By an appropriate choice of the flat
direction, the heavy scalar enjoys the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and is assumed
as DM particle. The scalon connects the visible and dark sector via the
Higgs-portal and by interacting with both the muon lepton and the VLL. The VLL
is charged under $U(1)_Y$ and interacts with $\gamma/Z$ bosons. We show that
the model correctly accounts for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance
in the universe, while naturally evading the current and future bounds from
direct detection (DD) experiments. Moreover, the model is capable to explain
the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly observed in Fermilab. We also show a feature in SISM
scenarios which is not present in other Higgs-portal models; despite having the
Higgs-portal term $|H|^2 s^2$ ($s$ being the scalon) in SISM, the effective
potential after the electroweak symmetry breaking lacks an important expected
vertex $h s^2$. This property immediately forbids the tree-level invisible

and the required training samples are proportional to the size of the traffic
network. In many cities, the available amount of traffic data is substantially
below the minimum requirement due to the data collection expense. It is still
an open question to develop traffic prediction models with a small size of
training data on large-scale networks. We notice that the traffic states of a
node for the near future only depend on the traffic states of its localized
neighborhoods, which can be represented using the graph relational inductive
biases. In view of this, this paper develops a graph network (GN)-based deep
learning model LocaleGN that depicts the traffic dynamics using localized data
aggregating and updating functions, as well as the node-wise recurrent neural
networks. LocaleGN is a light-weighted model designed for training on few

strip-based feature representations by directly taking each strip of the human

of gaits. ECM consists of the Spatial-Temporal feature extractor (ST), the
Frame-Level feature extractor (FL) and SPB, and has two obvious advantages:
First, each branch focuses on a specific representation, which can be used to
improve the robustness of the network. Specifically, ST aims to extract
spatial-temporal features of gait sequences, while FL is used to generate the
feature representation of each frame. Second, the parameters of the ECM can be
reduced in test by introducing a structural re-parameterization technique.

industry. Virtual services, ranging from virtual driver training to online
route optimization for smart goods delivery, are emerging in the Metaverse. To
make the human experience of virtual life more real, digital twins (DTs),
namely digital replicas of physical objects, are key enablers. However, DT
status may not always accurately reflect that of its real-world twin because
the latter may be subject to changes with time. As such, it is necessary to
synchronize a DT with its physical counterpart to ensure that its status is
accurate for virtual businesses in the Metaverse. In this paper, we propose a
dynamic hierarchical framework in which a group of IoT devices is incentivized
to sense and collect physical objects' status information collectively so as to
assists virtual service providers (VSPs) in synchronizing DTs. Based on the
collected sensing data and the value decay rate of the DTs, the VSPs can
determine synchronization intensities to maximize their payoffs. In our
proposed dynamic hierarchical framework, the lower-level evolutionary game
captures the VSPs selection by the IoT device population, and the upper-level
differential game captures the VSPs payoffs, which are affected by the
synchronization strategy, IoT devices selections, and the DTs value status,
given VSPs are simultaneous decision makers. We further consider the case in
which some VSPs are first movers and extend it as a Stackelberg differential
game. We theoretically and experimentally show that the equilibrium to the
lower-level game exists and is evolutionarily robust, and provide a sensitivity
analysis with respect to various system parameters. Experiments show that the
proposed dynamic hierarchical game outperform the baseline.

Mahalanobis similarity computations. Learning of the backbone representation

biases between seen and unseen categories in the semantic space. The
compounding biases result in many unseen action categories simply never being
selected during inference, hampering zero-shot progress. We seek to address
this limitation and introduce universal prototype transport for zero-shot
action recognition. The main idea is to re-position the semantic prototypes of
unseen actions through transduction, i.e. by using the distribution of the
unlabelled test set. For universal action models, we first seek to find a
hyperspherical optimal transport mapping from unseen action prototypes to the
set of all projected test videos. We then define a target prototype for each
unseen action as the weighted Fr\'echet mean over the transport couplings.
Equipped with a target prototype, we propose to re-position unseen action
prototypes along the geodesic spanned by the original and target prototypes,
acting as a form of semantic regularization. For universal object models, we
outline a variant that defines target prototypes based on an optimal transport
between unseen action prototypes and semantic object prototypes. Empirically,
we show that universal prototype transport diminishes the biased selection of
unseen action prototypes and boosts both universal action and object models,
resulting in state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification and
spatio-temporal localization.

texture and colorful information. Experimentally, we design the cross-domain
evaluation to support this view. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end
framework named GaitEdge which can effectively block gait-irrelevant
information and release end-to-end training potential. Specifically, GaitEdge
synthesizes the output of the pedestrian segmentation network and then feeds it
to the subsequent recognition network, where the synthetic silhouettes consist
of trainable edges of bodies and fixed interiors to limit the information that
the recognition network receives. Besides, GaitAlign for aligning silhouettes
is embedded into the GaitEdge without losing differentiability. Experimental
results on CASIA-B and our newly built TTG-200 indicate that GaitEdge
significantly outperforms the previous methods and provides a more practical

parameters are automatically stored in a database which may be queried to
retrieve quantitative measurements. We annotated LSB structures around 352
nearby massive galaxies with deep images obtained with the CFHT as part of two
large programs: MATLAS and UNIONS/CFIS. Each LSB structure was delineated and
labeled according to its likely nature: stellar shells, streams associated to a
disrupted satellite, tails formed in major mergers, ghost reflections or
cirrus. From our database containing 8441 annotations, the area, size, median
surface brightness and distance to the host of 228 structures were computed.
The results confirm the fact that tidal structures defined as streams are
thinner than tails, as expected by numerical simulations. In addition, tidal
tails appear to exhibit a higher surface brightness than streams (by about 1
mag), which may be related to different survival times for the two types of
collisional debris. We did not detect any tidal feature fainter than 27.5
mag.arcsec$^{-2}$, while the nominal surface brightness limits of our surveys
range between 28.3 and 29 mag.arcsec$^{-2}$, a difference that needs to be
taken into account when estimating the sensitivity of future surveys to
identify LSB structures. Our annotation database of observed LSB structures may
be used for quantitative analysis and as a training set for machine learning
algorithms (abbreviated).

the giant elliptical galaxy at the center of the Perseus cluster, that spans a
radius of $\sim$$5\,\rm kpc$. By comparing stellar absorption lines measured in
long-slit optical spectra with synthetic spectra for single stellar

populations: (i) a very young population that peaks in radial velocity at $\pm
250 {\rm \, km \, s^{-1}}$ of the systemic velocity within a radius of
$\sim$$720\,\rm pc$ of the nucleus, a $1\,\sigma$ velocity dispersion
significantly lower than $140 {\rm \, km \, s^{-1}}$, and an age of $0.15 \pm
0.05 \rm\,Gyr$; and (ii) a very old population having a constant radial
velocity with a radius corresponding to the systemic velocity, a much broader
velocity dispersion of $\sim$$250 {\rm \, km \, s^{-1}}$, and an age of around
$10\,\rm Gyr$. We attribute the former to a post-starburst population
associated with the spiral disk, and the latter to the main stellar body of NGC
1275 along the same sight line. If the spiral disk is the remnant of a
cannibalized galaxy, then its progenitor would have had to retain an enormous
amount of gas in the face of intensive ram-pressure stripping so as to form a
total initial mass in stars of $\sim 3 \times 10^9 \,M_\odot$. More likely, the
central spiral originally comprised a gaseous body accreted over the distant
past from a residual cooling flow, before experiencing a starburst
$\sim$$0.15\,\rm Gyr$ ago to form its stellar body.

magnetometer arrays, which are seldom located near critical power network
nodes. Interpolation of the geomagnetic field (B-field) is often needed, with
the spherical elementary current system (SECS) approach developed for
high-latitude regions favoured. We adapt this interpolation scheme to include
low-cost variometers to interpolate dB/dt directly and increase interpolation
accuracy. A further adaptation to the scheme is to physically represent the
mid-latitude context where most power networks and pipelines lie. The driving
current systems in these regions differ from their high-latitude counterparts.
Using a physics-consistent mid-latitude version of SECS, we show why previous

cross-instantiation meta-representation adaptation within a generative

light of this, we propose to equip CNPs by 1) aligning prediction with encoded
ground-truth observation, and 2) decoupling meta-representation adaptation from
generative reconstruction. Specifically, two auxiliary contrastive branches are
set up hierarchically, namely in-instantiation temporal contrastive

high-level abstraction of observations, whereas {\tt FCL} helps identify
underlying functions, which in turn provides more efficient representations.
Our model outperforms other CNPs variants when evaluating function distribution

general-purpose auxiliary tasks, e.g., maximizing correspondence between node
representations learned from the original and perturbed interaction graphs,
which are explicitly irrelevant to the recommendation task. Accordingly, the
rich semantics reflected by social relationships and item categories, which lie

To explore recommendation-specific auxiliary tasks, we first quantitatively

mass is (1.4$\pm$0.5) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$. The expansion velocities
are compatible with those of other LL SNe IIP (few 10$^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$). The
physical parameters obtained through hydrodynamical modelling are $R$ $\simeq$

problems. Standard statistical formulations of the problem are provably solved
by general convex programming techniques and more practical, fast
(nearly-linear time) iterative methods. However, these latter ""fast algorithms""
have previously been observed to be brittle in various real-world settings.
  We investigate the brittleness of fast sparse recovery algorithms to
generative model changes through the lens of studying their robustness to a
""helpful"" semi-random adversary, a framework which tests whether an algorithm
overfits to input assumptions. We consider the following basic model: let
$\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ be a measurement matrix which contains
an unknown subset of rows $\mathbf{G} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ which are
bounded and satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP), but is otherwise
arbitrary. Letting $x^\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be $s$-sparse, and given either
exact measurements $b = \mathbf{A} x^\star$ or noisy measurements $b =
\mathbf{A} x^\star + \xi$, we design algorithms recovering $x^\star$
information-theoretically optimally in nearly-linear time. We extend our
algorithm to hold for weaker generative models relaxing our planted RIP
assumption to a natural weighted variant, and show that our method's guarantees
naturally interpolate the quality of the measurement matrix to, in some
parameter regimes, run in sublinear time.
  Our approach differs from prior fast iterative methods with provable
guarantees under semi-random generative models: natural conditions on a
submatrix which make sparse recovery tractable are NP-hard to verify. We design
a new iterative method tailored to the geometry of sparse recovery which is
provably robust to our semi-random model. We hope our approach opens the door
to new robust, efficient algorithms for natural statistical inverse problems.

Make use of the Eulerian virial theorem at an arbitrary scale, far from the
cloud core, we derive an equation for the density profile and solve it in
approximate way. The result confirms the solution $\varrho(\ell)=\ell^{-2}$
found in the previous papers. This solution corresponds to three possible
configurations for the energy balance. For trans- or subsonic flows, we obtain
a balance between the gravitational and thermal energy (Case 1) or between the
gravitational, turbulent and thermal energies (Case 2) while for supersonic
flows, the possible balance is between the gravitational and turbulent energy
(Case 3). In Cases 1 and 2 the energy of the fluid element can be negative or
zero end thus the solution is dynamically stable and shall be long lived. In
Case 3 the energy of the fluid element is positive or zero, i.e., the solution
is unstable or at best marginally bound. At scales near the core, one cannot
neglect the second derivative of the moment of inertia of the gas, which
prevents derivation of an analytic equation for the density profile. However,
we obtain that gas near the core is not virialized and its state is marginally
bound since the energy of the fluid element vanishes.

extra human-labeled navigation data and lack self-exploration capabilities in

the ability of fast cross-domain adaptation, we propose Prompt-based
Environmental Self-exploration (ProbES), which can self-explore the
environments by sampling trajectories and automatically generates structured
instructions via a large-scale cross-modal pretrained model (CLIP). Our method
fully utilizes the knowledge learned from CLIP to build an in-domain dataset by
self-exploration without human labeling. Unlike the conventional approach of
fine-tuning, we introduce prompt-based learning to achieve fast adaptation for
language embeddings, which substantially improves the learning efficiency by
leveraging prior knowledge. By automatically synthesizing
trajectory-instruction pairs in any environment without human supervision and
efficient prompt-based learning, our model can adapt to diverse vision-language

decomposed into two or more permutation-equivariant ones in a dot-product way
as the cardinality of the given input set is greater than a threshold. We also
show that the DuMLP-Pin can be viewed as Deep Sets with strong constraints
under certain conditions. The performance of DuMLP-Pin is evaluated on several
different tasks with diverse data sets. The experimental results demonstrate
that our DuMLP-Pin achieves the best results on the two classification problems
for pixel sets and attribute sets. On both the point cloud classification and
the part segmentation, the accuracy of DuMLP-Pin is very close to the so-far
best-performing local aggregation method with only a 1-2% difference, while the
number of required parameters is significantly reduced by more than 85% in
classification and 69% in segmentation, respectively. The code is publicly

crystal elastomer in the top layer and a nonlinearly elastic material in the
bottom layer. While the bottom layer is assumed to be stress-free in the flat
reference configuration, the top layer features an eigenstrain that depends on
the local liquid crystal orientation. As a consequence, the plate shows
non-flat deformations in equilibrium with a geometry that non-trivially depends
on the relative thickness and shape of the plate, material parameters, boundary
conditions for the deformation, and anchorings of the liquid crystal
orientation. We focus on thin plates in the bending regime and derive a
two-dimensional bending model that combines a nonlinear bending energy for the
deformation, with a surface Oseen-Frank energy for the director field that
describes the local orientation of the liquid crystal elastomer. Both energies
are nonlinearly coupled by means of a spontaneous curvature term that
effectively describes the nematic-elastic coupling. We rigorously derive this
model as a {\Gamma}-limit from three-dimensional, nonlinear elasticity. We also
devise a new numerical algorithm to compute stationary points of the
two-dimensional model. We conduct numerical experiments and present simulation
results that illustrate the practical properties of the proposed scheme as well

right network architecture is important. Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
concerns the automatic discovery of task-specific network architectures. Modern
NAS approaches leverage supernetworks whose subnetworks encode candidate neural
network architectures. These subnetworks can be trained simultaneously,
removing the need to train each network from scratch, thereby increasing the
efficiency of NAS. A recent method called Neural Architecture Transfer (NAT)
further improves the efficiency of NAS for computer vision tasks by using a
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find high-quality subnetworks of a

Evolutionary Neural Cascade Search. ENCAS can be used to search over multiple

We test ENCAS on common computer vision benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,

histological assessment and malignancy grading of tumors. The WSI-based grading
promises to provide rapid diagnostic support and facilitate digital health.
Currently, the most commonly used WSIs are derived from formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and Frozen section. The majority of automatic tumor
grading models are developed based on FFPE sections, which could be affected by
the artifacts introduced by tissue processing. The frozen section exists
problems such as low quality that might influence training within single
modality as well. To overcome this problem in a single modal training and
achieve better multi-modal and discriminative representation disentanglement in
brain tumor, we propose a mutual contrastive low-rank learning (MCL) scheme to
integrate FFPE and frozen sections for glioma grading. We first design a mutual
learning scheme to jointly optimize the model training based on FFPE and frozen
sections. In this proposed scheme, we design a normalized modality contrastive
loss (NMC-loss), which could promote to disentangle multi-modality
complementary representation of FFPE and frozen sections from the same patient.
To reduce intra-class variance, and increase inter-class margin at intra- and
inter-patient levels, we conduct a low-rank (LR) loss. Our experiments show
that the proposed scheme achieves better performance than the model trained
based on each single modality or mixed modalities and even improves the feature
extraction in classical attention-based multiple instances learning methods
(MIL). The combination of NMC-loss and low-rank loss outperforms other typical
contrastive loss functions.

benchmarking of lower limb exoskeletons performance. In the field of assisted
walking by powered lower limb exoskeletons, the EXOSMOOTH project proposes an
experiment that targets two scientific questions. The first question is related
to the effectiveness of a novel control strategy for smooth assistance. Current
assist strategies are based on controllers that switch the assistance level
based on the gait segmentation provided by a finite state machine. The proposed
strategy aims at managing phase transitions to provide a smoother assistance to
the user, thus increasing the device transparency and comfort for the user. The
second question is the role of the actuation at the ankle joint in assisted
walking. Many novel exoskeletons devised for industrial applications do not
feature an actuated ankle joint. In the EXOSMOOTH project, the ankle joint
actuation will be one experimental factor to have a direct assessment of the
role of an actuated joint in assisted walking. Preliminary results of 15
healthy subjects walking at different speeds while wearing a lower limb
exoskeleton supported the rationale behind this question: having an actuated
ankle joint could potentially reduce the torques applied by the user by a
maximum value of 85 Nm. The two aforementioned questions will be investigated
in a protocol that includes walking on a treadmill and on flat ground, with or
without slope, and with a load applied on the back. In addition, the
interaction forces measured at the exoskeleton harnesses will be used to assess
the comfort of the user and the effectiveness of the control strategy to
improve transparency.

extend this result by considering the dynamics of particles and fluids in the
context of theories of gravity nonminimally coupled to matter. We show that the
equation for the evolution of the linear momentum of the particles may be
obtained irrespective of any prior assumptions regarding the form of the
on-shell Lagrangian of the matter fields. We also find that consistency between
the evolution of the energy and linear momentum of the particles requires that
their volume-averaged on-shell Lagrangian and energy-momentum tensor trace
coincide ($\mathcal L_{\rm on-shell}=T$). We further demonstrate that the same
applies to an ideal gas composed of many such particles. This result implies
that the two most common assumptions in the literature for the on-shell
Lagrangian of a perfect fluid ($\mathcal L_{\rm on-shell}=\mathcal{P}$ and
$\mathcal L_{\rm on-shell}=-\rho$, where $\rho$ and $\mathcal{P}$ are the

that the norm of $X^*$ is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable at a dense subset,
improves a result by J.\ Lindenstrauss and we even present an example showing
that Lindenstrauss' result was not optimal. In the reverse direction, we obtain
results for the density of the $G_\delta$ set of absolutely strongly exposing

made great progress in semantic segmentation of street scenes. Some recent
methods align feature maps to alleviate the semantic gap between them and
achieve high segmentation accuracy. However, they usually adopt the feature
alignment modules with the same network configuration in the decoder and thus
ignore the different roles of stages of the decoder during feature aggregation,
leading to a complex decoder structure. Such a manner greatly affects the
inference speed. In this paper, we present a novel Stage-aware Feature
Alignment Network (SFANet) based on the encoder-decoder structure for real-time
semantic segmentation of street scenes. Specifically, a Stage-aware Feature
Alignment module (SFA) is proposed to align and aggregate two adjacent levels
of feature maps effectively. In the SFA, by taking into account the unique role
of each stage in the decoder, a novel stage-aware Feature Enhancement Block
(FEB) is designed to enhance spatial details and contextual information of
feature maps from the encoder. In this way, we are able to address the
misalignment problem with a very simple and efficient multi-branch decoder
structure. Moreover, an auxiliary training strategy is developed to explicitly
alleviate the multi-scale object problem without bringing additional
computational costs during the inference phase. Experimental results show that
the proposed SFANet exhibits a good balance between accuracy and speed for
real-time semantic segmentation of street scenes. In particular, based on
ResNet-18, SFANet respectively obtains 78.1% and 74.7% mean of class-wise
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) at inference speeds of 37 FPS and 96 FPS on the
challenging Cityscapes and CamVid test datasets by using only a single GTX

hyperparameter tuning and training method based on Bayesian optimisation.
Adaptive selection of model hyperparameters and training features can be

Brown dwarfs are poorly understood transition objects between stars
and planets, with several competing mechanisms having been proposed for their
formation. Mass measurements are generally difficult for isolated objects but
also for brown dwarfs orbiting low-mass stars, which are often too faint for
spectroscopic follow-up. Aims. Microlensing provides an alternative tool for
the discovery and investigation of such faint systems. Here we present the
analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2019-BLG-0033/MOA-2019-BLG-035, which
is due to a binary system composed of a brown dwarf orbiting a red dwarf.
Methods. Thanks to extensive ground observations and the availability of space
observations from Spitzer, it has been possible to obtain accurate estimates of
all microlensing parameters, including parallax, source radius and orbital
motion of the binary lens. Results. After accurate modeling, we find that the
lens is composed of a red dwarf with mass $M_1 = 0.149 \pm 0.010M_\odot$ and a
brown dwarf with mass $M_2 = 0.0463 \pm 0.0031M_\odot$, at a projected
separation of $a_\perp = 0.585$ au. The system has a peculiar velocity that is
typical of old metal-poor populations in the thick disk. Percent precision in
the mass measurement of brown dwarfs has been achieved only in a few
microlensing events up to now, but will likely become common with the Roman
space telescope.

generation, disentangled control by driving video or audio, and flexible face
editing. Our framework elevates the resolution of the synthesized talking face
to 1024*1024 for the first time, even though the training dataset has a lower
resolution. We design a video-based motion generation module and an audio-based
one, which can be plugged into the framework either individually or jointly to
drive the video generation. The predicted motion is used to transform the
latent features of StyleGAN for visual animation. To compensate for the
transformation distortion, we propose a calibration network as well as a domain
loss to refine the features. Moreover, our framework allows two types of facial
editing, i.e., global editing via GAN inversion and intuitive editing based on
3D morphable models. Comprehensive experiments show superior video quality,
flexible controllability, and editability over state-of-the-art methods.

  Segmentation in Street Scenes",,,"10.1109/TITS.2022.3150350",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-time semantic segmentation, which aims to achieve high segmentation
accuracy at real-time inference speed, has received substantial attention over
the past few years. However, many state-of-the-art real-time semantic
segmentation methods tend to sacrifice some spatial details or contextual
information for fast inference, thus leading to degradation in segmentation
quality. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Multi-branch Aggregation
Network (called DMA-Net) based on the encoder-decoder structure to perform
real-time semantic segmentation in street scenes. Specifically, we first adopt
ResNet-18 as the encoder to efficiently generate various levels of feature maps
from different stages of convolutions. Then, we develop a Multi-branch
Aggregation Network (MAN) as the decoder to effectively aggregate different
levels of feature maps and capture the multi-scale information. In MAN, a
lattice enhanced residual block is designed to enhance feature representations
of the network by taking advantage of the lattice structure. Meanwhile, a
feature transformation block is introduced to explicitly transform the feature
map from the neighboring branch before feature aggregation. Moreover, a global
context block is used to exploit the global contextual information. These key
components are tightly combined and jointly optimized in a unified network.
Extensive experimental results on the challenging Cityscapes and CamVid
datasets demonstrate that our proposed DMA-Net respectively obtains 77.0% and
73.6% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) at the inference speed of 46.7 FPS
and 119.8 FPS by only using a single NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU. This shows that
DMA-Net provides a good tradeoff between segmentation quality and speed for
semantic segmentation in street scenes.

static appearances and dynamic walking patterns. However, we observe that many
part-based methods neglect representations at boundaries. In addition, the
phenomenon of overfitting on training data is relatively common in gait
recognition, which is perhaps due to insufficient data and low-informative gait
silhouettes. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel mask-based
regularization method named ReverseMask. By injecting perturbation on the
feature map, the proposed regularization method helps convolutional
architecture learn the discriminative representations and enhances
generalization. Also, we design an Inception-like ReverseMask Block, which has
three branches composed of a global branch, a feature dropping branch, and a
feature scaling branch. Precisely, the dropping branch can extract fine-grained
representations when partial activations are zero-outed. Meanwhile, the scaling
branch randomly scales the feature map, keeping structural information of
activations and preventing overfitting. The plug-and-play Inception-like
ReverseMask block is simple and effective to generalize networks, and it also
improves the performance of many state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the ReverseMask regularization help baseline
achieves higher accuracy and better generalization. Moreover, the baseline with
Inception-like Block significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
two most popular datasets, CASIA-B and OUMVLP. The source code will be

adversarial perturbations. Previous adversarial attacks on 3D point cloud
recognition have often been criticized for their noticeable point outliers,
since they just involve an ""implicit constrain"" like global distance loss in
the time-consuming optimization to limit the generated noise. While point cloud
is a highly structured data format, it is hard to constrain its perturbation
with a simple loss or metric properly. In this paper, we propose a novel
Point-Cloud Sensitivity Map to boost both the efficiency and imperceptibility
of point perturbations. This map reveals the vulnerability of point cloud
recognition models when encountering shape-invariant adversarial noises. These
noises are designed along the shape surface with an ""explicit constrain""
instead of extra distance loss. Specifically, we first apply a reversible
coordinate transformation on each point of the point cloud input, to reduce one
degree of point freedom and limit its movement on the tangent plane. Then we
calculate the best attacking direction with the gradients of the transformed
point cloud obtained on the white-box model. Finally we assign each point with
a non-negative score to construct the sensitivity map, which benefits both
white-box adversarial invisibility and black-box query-efficiency extended in
our work. Extensive evaluations prove that our method can achieve the superior
performance on various point cloud recognition models, with its satisfying
adversarial imperceptibility and strong resistance to different point cloud

most methods require prohibitively large amounts of data for learning a useful
control policy. In this work, we study the integration of robotic reachability
priors in actor-critic RL methods for accelerating the learning of MM for
reaching and fetching tasks. Namely, we consider the problem of optimal base
placement and the subsequent decision of whether to activate the arm for
reaching a 6D target. For this, we devise a novel Hybrid RL method that handles
discrete and continuous actions jointly, resorting to the Gumbel-Softmax
reparameterization. Next, we train a reachability prior using data from the
operational robot workspace, inspired by classical methods. Subsequently, we
derive Boosted Hybrid RL (BHyRL), a novel algorithm for learning Q-functions by
modeling them as a sum of residual approximators. Every time a new task needs
to be learned, we can transfer our learned residuals and learn the component of
the Q-function that is task-specific, hence, maintaining the task structure
from prior behaviors. Moreover, we find that regularizing the target policy
with a prior policy yields more expressive behaviors. We evaluate our method in

investment strategies ensuring these guarantees are challenged nowadays by low
interest rates. Thus, we study an alternative strategy when an insurance
company shares financial risk with a reinsurance company. We model this
situation as a Stackelberg game. The reinsurer is the leader in the game and
maximizes its expected utility by selecting its optimal investment strategy and
a safety loading in the reinsurance contract it offers to the insurer. The
reinsurer can assess how the insurer will rationally react on each action of
the reinsurer. The insurance company is the follower and maximizes its expected
utility by choosing its investment strategy and the amount of reinsurance the
company purchases at the price offered by the reinsurer. In this game, we
derive the Stackelberg equilibrium for general utility functions. For power
utility functions, we calculate the equilibrium explicitly and find that the
reinsurer selects the largest reinsurance premium such that the insurer may
still buy the maximal amount of reinsurance. Since in the equilibrium the
insurer is indifferent in the amount of reinsurance, in practice, the reinsurer
should consider charging a smaller reinsurance premium than the equilibrium
one. Therefore, we propose several criteria for choosing such a discount rate
and investigate its wealth-equivalent impact on the utilities of both parties.

form $V_n=\frac{1}{n}XX^T$, where $X$ is a $p\times n$ data matrix and $p/n\to

correlations converge uniformly to zero at a speed of $a_n/n$, where $a_n$ may
grow mildly to infinity. We employ the method of moments tightly: We identify
the exact condition on the growth of $a_n$ which will guarantee that the
moments of the empirical spectral distributions (ESDs) converge to the MP
moments. If the condition is not met, we can construct an ensemble for which
all but finitely many moments of the ESDs diverge. We also investigate the
operator norm of $V_n$ under a uniform correlation bound of $C/n^{\delta}$,
where $C,\delta>0$ are fixed, and observe a phase transition at $\delta=1$. In
particular, convergence of the operator norm to the maximum of the support of
the MP distribution can only be guaranteed if $\delta>1$. The analysis leads to
an example for which the MP law holds almost surely, but the operator norm
remains stochastic in the limit, and we provide its exact limiting
distribution.

a large portion of annual precipitation and extreme rainfall events over

cyclone tracking. Both approaches reveal four dominant weather patterns that
lead to the genesis of these systems; specifically, re-intensification of
westward moving synoptic systems from Bay of Bengal (Type 1, 51%), in-situ
formation with a coexisting cyclonic system over the Bay of Bengal that
precedes (Type 2a, 31%) or follows (Type 2b, 10%) genesis in the Arabian Sea,
and finally in-situ genesis within a northwestward propagating cyclonic anomaly
from the south Bay of Bengal (Type 2c, 8%). Thus, a large fraction of rainy
middle tropospheric synoptic systems in this region form in association with
cyclonic activity in the Bay of Bengal. The four variants identified also show
a marked dependence on large-scale environmental features with Type 1 and Type
2a formation primarily occurring in phases 4 and 5, and Type 2b and Type 2c in
phases 3 and 4 of the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation. Further, while
in-situ formation with a Bay of Bengal cyclonic anomaly (Type 2a and 2b) mostly
occurs in June, downstream development is more likely in the core of the
monsoon season. Out of all categories, Type 2a is associated with the highest
rain rate (60 mm/day) and points towards the dynamical interaction between a
low pressure system over the Bay of Bengal and the development of MTCs over
western India and the northeast Arabian Sea. This classification,
identification of precursors, connection with cyclonic activity over the Bay of

In this paper, we introduce a novel contour-based method, named E2EC, for

contour initialization architecture instead of hand-crafted contour
initialization. This consists of a contour initialization module for
constructing more explicit learning goals and a global contour deformation

loss. The experiments showed that E2EC can achieve a state-of-the-art

synchronous applications in wired and wireless distributed systems. In wired
systems, self-stabilizing Byzantine pulse synchronization aims for
synchronizing fault-prone distributed components with arbitrary initial states
in bounded-delay message-passing systems. In wireless systems, fault-tolerant
synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators is also built for a similar goal
but often works under specific system restrictions, such as low computation
power, low message complexity, and anonymous physical pulses whose senders
cannot be identified by the receivers. These restrictions often prevent us from
constructing high-reliable wireless synchronous applications. This paper tries
to break barriers between bounded-delay message-passing systems and classical
pulse-coupled oscillators by introducing a new fault-tolerant synchronization
scheme for the so-called anonymous bounded-delay pulsing systems in the
presence of indeterministic communication delays and inconsistent faults. For
low computation power and low message complexity, instead of involving in
consensus-based primitives, the proposed synchronization scheme integrates the
so-called discrete mean-fields, planar random walks, and some additional easy
operations in utilizing only sparsely generated anonymous pulses. For
fault-tolerance, we show that a square-root number of faulty oscillators can be
tolerated by utilizing planar random walks in anonymous pulse synchronization.
For self-stabilization, we show that the stabilization can be reached in an
expected constant number of observing windows in anonymous bounded-delay
pulsing systems with the pulsing-frequency restriction.

to time series environments. First, most economic time series have strong
autocorrelation, which renders HAC regression parameter estimates highly
inefficient. Second, strong autocorrelation similarly renders HAC conditional
predictions highly inefficient. Finally, the structure of most popular HAC

annotated examples. Most existing methods adopt prototype learning
architecture, where support prototype vectors are expanded and concatenated
with query features to perform conditional segmentation. However, such
framework potentially focuses more on query features while may neglect the
similarity between support and query features. This paper proposes a
contrastive enhancement approach using latent prototypes to leverage latent
classes and raise the utilization of similarity information between prototype
and query features. Specifically, a latent prototype sampling module is
proposed to generate pseudo-mask and novel prototypes based on features
similarity. The module conveniently conducts end-to-end learning and has no
strong dependence on clustering numbers like cluster-based method. Besides, a
contrastive enhancement module is developed to drive models to provide
different predictions with the same query features. Our method can be used as
an auxiliary module to flexibly integrate into other baselines for a better
segmentation performance. Extensive experiments show our approach remarkably
improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods for 1-shot and 5-shot

ponds that significantly lower the ice reflectivity and accelerate melting.
Ponds develop over the melt season through an initial rapid growth stage
followed by drainage through macroscopic holes. Recent analysis of melt pond
photographs indicates that late-summer ponds exist near the critical
percolation threshold, a special pond coverage fraction below which the ponds
are largely disconnected and above which they are highly connected. Here, we
show that the percolation threshold, a statistical property of ice topography,
constrains pond evolution due to pond drainage through macroscopic holes. We
show that it sets the approximate upper limit and scales pond coverage
throughout its evolution after the beginning of drainage. Furthermore, we show
that the rescaled pond coverage during drainage is a universal function of a
single non-dimensional parameter, $\eta$, roughly interpreted as the number of
drainage holes per characteristic area of the surface. This universal curve
allows us to formulate an equation for pond coverage time-evolution during and
after pond drainage that captures the dependence on environmental parameters
and is supported by observations on undeformed first-year ice. This equation
reveals that pond coverage is highly sensitive to environmental parameters,
suggesting that modeling uncertainties could be reduced by more directly
parameterizing the ponds' natural parameter, $\eta$. Our work uncovers
previously unrecognized constraints on melt pond physics and places ponds
within a broader context of phase transitions and critical phenomena.
Therefore, it holds promise for improving ice-albedo parameterizations in
large-scale models.

undesirable (Pareto-dominated) outcomes. To mitigate this, Learning with
Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) introduced opponent shaping to this setting,
by accounting for each agent's influence on their opponents' anticipated
learning steps. However, the original LOLA formulation (and follow-up work) is
inconsistent because LOLA models other agents as naive learners rather than
LOLA agents. In previous work, this inconsistency was suggested as a cause of
LOLA's failure to preserve stable fixed points (SFPs). First, we formalize
consistency and show that higher-order LOLA (HOLA) solves LOLA's inconsistency
problem if it converges. Second, we correct a claim made in the literature by
Sch\""afer and Anandkumar (2019), proving that Competitive Gradient Descent
(CGD) does not recover HOLA as a series expansion (and fails to solve the
consistency problem). Third, we propose a new method called Consistent LOLA
(COLA), which learns update functions that are consistent under mutual opponent
shaping. It requires no more than second-order derivatives and learns
consistent update functions even when HOLA fails to converge. However, we also
prove that even consistent update functions do not preserve SFPs, contradicting
the hypothesis that this shortcoming is caused by LOLA's inconsistency.
Finally, in an empirical evaluation on a set of general-sum games, we find that
COLA finds prosocial solutions and that it converges under a wider range of
learning rates than HOLA and LOLA. We support the latter finding with a
theoretical result for a simple game.

model to describe how populist discourse by a nation's political leader
influences entrepreneurship. We hypothesize that populist discourse reduces
entrepreneurship by creating regime uncertainty concerning the future stability
of the institutional environment, resulting in entrepreneurs anticipating
higher future transaction costs. Our model highlights two important factors
that moderate the relationship. First, is the strength of political checks and
balances, which we hypothesize weakens the negative relationship between
populist discourse and entrepreneurship by providing entrepreneurs with greater
confidence that the actions of a populist will be constrained. Second, the
political ideology of the leader moderates the relationship between populist
discourse and entrepreneurship. The anti-capitalistic rhetoric of left-wing
populism will create greater regime uncertainty than right-wing populism, which
is often accompanied by rhetoric critical of free trade and foreigners but also
supportive of business interests. The effect of centrist populism, which is
accompanied by a mix of contradictory and often moderate ideas that make it
difficult to discern future transaction costs, will have a weaker negative
effect on entrepreneurship than either left-wing or right-wing populism. We
empirically test our model using a multi-level design and a dataset comprised
of more than 780,000 individuals in 33 countries over the period 2002-2016. Our
analysis largely supports our theory regarding the moderating role of ideology.
Still, surprisingly, our findings suggest that the negative effect of populism
on entrepreneurship is greater in nations with stronger checks and balances.

optical spin cooling and the collective spin-resonator coupling, we extend the
standard Jaynes-Cumming model to account for the rich electronic and spin

pressure will first reach a maximum and then decrease monotonically to approach
a constant asymptote. The pressure maximum corresponds to the initiation of a
localised bulge and is predicted by a bifurcation condition, whereas the
asymptote is the Maxwell pressure corresponding to a ""two-phase"" propagation
state. In contrast, when the tube is first pre-stretched and then has its ends
fixed during subsequent inflation, the pressure versus bulge amplitude has both
a maximum and a minimum, and the behaviour on the right ascending branch has
previously not been fully understood. We show that for all values of
pre-stretch and tube length, the ascending branches all converge to a single
curve that is only dependent on the ratio of tube thickness to the outer
radius. This curve represents the Maxwell state to be approached in each case
(if Euler buckling or axisymmetric wrinkling does not occur first), but this
state is pressure-dependent in contrast with the free-ends case. We also
demonstrate experimentally that localized bulging cannot occur when the
pre-stretch is sufficiently large and investigate what strain-energy functions
can predict this observed phenomenon.

challenging task. Existing 3D pose detection methods exhibit excellent
performance under normal conditions however their performance may degrade due
to occlusion. Recently some occlusion aware methods have also been proposed,
however, the occlusion handling capability of these networks has not yet been
thoroughly investigated. In the current work, we propose an occlusion-guided 3D
human pose estimation framework and quantify its occlusion handling capability
by using different protocols. The proposed method estimates more accurate 3D
human poses using 2D skeletons with missing joints as input. Missing joints are
handled by introducing occlusion guidance that provides extra information about
the absence or presence of a joint. Temporal information has also been
exploited to better estimate the missing joints. A large number of experiments
are performed for the quantification of occlusion handling capability of the
proposed method on three publicly available datasets in various settings
including random missing joints, fixed body parts missing, and complete frames
missing, using mean per joint position error criterion. In addition to that,
the quality of the predicted 3D poses is also evaluated using action
classification performance as a criterion. 3D poses estimated by the proposed
method achieved significantly improved action recognition performance in the
presence of missing joints. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework for handling the missing joints as well as
quantification of the occlusion handling capability of the deep neural

  Pointer Tagging on Intel x86-64",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Memory safety in complex applications implemented in unsafe programming
languages such as C/C++ is still an unresolved problem in practice. Many
different types of defenses have been proposed in the past to mitigate this
problem. The most promising next step is a tighter integration of the hardware
and software level: modern mitigation techniques are either accelerated using
hardware extensions or implemented in the hardware by extensions of the ISA. In
particular, memory tagging, as proposed by ARM or SPARC, promises to solve many
issues for practical memory safety. Unfortunately, Intel x86-64, which
represents the most important ISA for both the desktop and server domain, lacks
support for hardware-accelerated memory tagging, so memory tagging is not
considered practical for this platform.
  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an efficient,
software-only pointer tagging scheme for Intel x86-64 based on a novel metadata
embedding scheme. The basic idea is to alias multiple virtual pages to one
physical page so that we can efficiently embed tag bits into a pointer.
Furthermore, we introduce several optimizations that significantly reduce the
performance impact of this approach to memory tagging. Based on this scheme, we
propose a novel use-after-free mitigation scheme, called xTag, that offers
better performance and strong security properties compared to state-of-the-art
methods. We also show how double-free vulnerabilities can be mitigated. Our
approach is highly compatible, allowing pointers to be passed back and forth
between instrumented and non-instrumented code without losing metadata, and it
is even compatible with inline assembly. We conclude that building exploit
mitigation mechanisms on top of our memory tagging scheme is feasible on Intel
x86-64, as demonstrated by the effective prevention of use-after-free bugs in
the Firefox web browser.

deformations in large reflector antennas due to gravity, but have not yet been

a terrestrial laser scanner to measure thermal deformations on the primary
reflector of the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Our method involves the use of
differential measurements to reduce the systematic effects of the terrestrial
laser scanner. We use the active surface of the primary reflector of the GBT to
validate our method and explore its limitations. We find that when using
differential measurements it is possible to accurately measure deformations
corresponding to different Zernike polynomials down to an amplitude of 60
$\mu$m. The difference between the amplitudes of known deformations and those
measured are $<140~\mu$m when the wind speed is $\lesssim2$ m s$^{-1}$. From
these differences we estimate that it should be possible to bring the surface
error of the GBT down to $240\pm6~\mu$m. This suggests that using a commercial
off-the-shelf terrestrial laser scanner it is possible to measure deformations
induced by thermal gradients on a large parabolic reflector.

field $B$ to an invariant toroidal surface $S$ is linearisable. The main
results are similar in conclusion to Arnold's Structure Theorems but require
weaker assumptions than the commutation $[B,\nabla\times B] = 0$. Relaxing the
need for a first integral of $B$ (also known as a flux function), we assume the
existence of a solution $u : S \to \mathbb{R}$ to the cohomological equation
$B|_S(u) = \partial_n B$ on a toroidal surface $S$ mutually invariant to $B$
and $\nabla \times B$. The right hand side $\partial_n B$ is a normal surface
derivative available to vector fields tangent to $S$. In this situation, we
show that the field $B$ on $S$ is either identically zero or nowhere vanishing
with $B|_S/\|B\|^2 |_S$ being linearisable. We are calling the latter the
semi-linearisability of $B$ (with proportionality $\|B\|^2 |_S$). The
non-vanishing property relies on Bers' results in pseudo-analytic function
theory about a generalised Laplace-Beltrami equation arising from Witten
cohomology deformation. With the use of de Rham cohomology, we also point out a
Diophantine integral condition where one can conclude that $B|_S$ itself is
linearisable. The linearisability of $B|_S$ is fundamental to the so-called
magnetic coordinates, which are central to the theory of magnetically confined
plasmas.

These arguments are questionable. In particular, when the Tsallis entropy that

that result (i.e., the polytropes) are physically sensible. This work spells
out this and other arguments for TE, and presents the polytropes and their

observed in galaxies to be consistent with polytropes. It compares polytropes

the goal of inducing specific desired mistakes, have raised substantial
concern: even just the possibility of such an attack can make a user no longer
trust the results of a learning system. In this work, we show how to achieve
strong robustness guarantees in the face of such attacks across multiple axes.
  We provide robustly-reliable predictions, in which the predicted label is
guaranteed to be correct so long as the adversary has not exceeded a given
corruption budget, even in the presence of instance targeted attacks, where the
adversary knows the test example in advance and aims to cause a specific
failure on that example. Our guarantees are substantially stronger than those

prediction of the learning algorithm does not change, as opposed to certifying
that the prediction is correct, as we are able to achieve in our work.
Remarkably, we provide a complete characterization of learnability in this

this region given an ERM oracle. Moreover, for the case of linear separators

Markov chains are: (i) the framework of Spectral Independence, introduced by
Anari, Liu and Oveis Gharan, and its numerous extensions, which have given rise
to several breakthroughs in the analysis of mixing times of discrete Markov
chains and (ii) the Stochastic Localization technique which has proven useful
in establishing mixing and expansion bounds for both log-concave measures and
for measures on the discrete hypercube. In this paper, we introduce a framework
which connects ideas from both techniques. Our framework unifies, simplifies
and extends those two techniques. In its center is the concept of a
localization scheme which, to every probability measure, assigns a martingale
of probability measures which localize in space as time evolves. As it turns
out, to every such scheme corresponds a Markov chain, and many chains of
interest appear naturally in this framework. This viewpoint provides tools for
deriving mixing bounds for the dynamics through the analysis of the
corresponding localization process. Generalizations of concepts of Spectral
Independence and Entropic Independence naturally arise from our definitions,
and in particular we recover the main theorems in the spectral and entropic
independence frameworks via simple martingale arguments (completely bypassing
the need to use the theory of high-dimensional expanders). We demonstrate the
strength of our proposed machinery by giving short and (arguably) simpler
proofs to many mixing bounds in the recent literature, including giving the
first $O(n \log n)$ bound for the mixing time of Glauber dynamics on the
hardcore-model (of arbitrary degree) in the tree-uniqueness regime.

trade-off between their tunability range and sensitivity to flux noise.
Optimizing this trade-off is particularly important for enabling fast,

conditions on the frequency landscape of neighboring qubits, which are
difficult to satisfy with non-tunable transmons due to their relatively large

information is a challenging yet crucial task for clinical care. However the
primitive and most common approach to retrieval, involving text in the form of
keywords, is severely limited when dealing with complex media formats.
Content-based retrieval offers a way to overcome this limitation, by using rich
media as the query itself. Surgical video-to-video retrieval in particular is a
new and largely unexplored research problem with high clinical value,
especially in the real-time case: using real-time video hashing, search can be
achieved directly inside of the operating room. Indeed, the process of hashing
converts large data entries into compact binary arrays or hashes, enabling
large-scale search operations at a very fast rate. However, due to fluctuations
over the course of a video, not all bits in a given hash are equally reliable.
In this work, we propose a method capable of mitigating this uncertainty while
maintaining a light computational footprint. We present superior retrieval
results (3-4 % top 10 mean average precision) on a multi-task evaluation
protocol for surgery, using cholecystectomy phases, bypass phases, and coming
from an entirely new dataset introduced here, critical events across six
different surgery types. Success on this multi-task benchmark shows the
generalizability of our approach for surgical video retrieval.

into the agent's mechanisms such that its decisions are understandable by an

interactions prohibits deep inspections of the decision-making algorithm. To
support interpretability in online settings it is useful to borrow from the
Explainable Planning literature methods that focus on the legibility of the
agent, by making its intention easily discernable in an observer model. As we
propose in this paper, injecting legible behavior inside an agent's policy
doesn't require modify components of its learning algorithm. Rather, the
agent's optimal policy can be regularized for legibility by evaluating how the
policy may produce observations that would make an observer infer an incorrect
policy. In our formulation, the decision boundary introduced by legibility
impacts the states in which the agent's policy returns an action that has high
likelihood also in other policies. In these cases, a trade-off between such
action, and legible/sub-optimal action is made.

building-systems operations. Previous research has relied on CO$_2$ sensors and
vision-based techniques to determine occupancy patterns. Vision-based
techniques provide highly accurate information; however, they are very
intrusive. Therefore, motion or CO$_2$ sensors are more widely adopted
worldwide. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are another pollutant originating
from the occupants. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the
impact of occupants on the VOC level. In this paper, continuous measurements of
CO$_2$, VOC, light, temperature, and humidity were recorded in a 17,000 sqft
open office space for around four months. Using different statistical models
(e.g., SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest) we evaluated which
combination of environmental factors provides more accurate insights on
occupant presence. Our preliminary results indicate that VOC is a good
indicator of occupancy detection in some cases. It is also concluded that
proper feature selection and developing appropriate global occupancy detection
models can reduce the cost and energy of data collection without a significant
impact on accuracy.

during training are also available during testing, which is not guaranteed in
clinical practice. Previously, a training strategy termed Modality Dropout
(ModDrop) has been applied to MS lesion segmentation to achieve the
state-of-the-art performance with missing modality. In this paper, we present a
novel method dubbed ModDrop++ to train a unified network adaptive to an
arbitrary number of input MRI sequences. ModDrop++ upgrades the main idea of
ModDrop in two key ways. First, we devise a plug-and-play dynamic head and
adopt a filter scaling strategy to improve the expressiveness of the network.
Second, we design a co-training strategy to leverage the intra-subject relation
between full modality and missing modality. Specifically, the intra-subject
co-training strategy aims to guide the dynamic head to generate similar feature
representations between the full- and missing-modality data from the same
subject. We use two public MS datasets to show the superiority of ModDrop++.

algorithmic decision making (ADM) has advanced to a point of sophisticated
specialisation. However, the relations between technical (formalised) and
ethical discourse on fairness are not always clear and productive. Arguing for
an alternative perspective, we review existing fairness metrics and discuss
some common issues. For instance, the fairness of procedures and distributions
is often formalised and discussed statically, disregarding both structural
preconditions of the status quo and downstream effects of a given intervention.
We then introduce dynamic fairness modelling, a more comprehensive approach
that realigns formal fairness metrics with arguments from the ethical
discourse. A dynamic fairness model incorporates (1) ethical goals, (2) formal
metrics to quantify decision procedures and outcomes and (3) mid-term or
long-term downstream effects. By contextualising these elements of
fairness-related processes, dynamic fairness modelling explicates formerly
latent ethical aspects and thereby provides a helpful tool to navigate
trade-offs between different fairness interventions. To illustrate the
framework, we discuss an example application -- the current European efforts to
increase the number of women on company boards, e.g. via quota solutions -- and
present early technical work that fits within our framework.

QSDsan can be used to enumerate and investigate the opportunity space for
emerging technologies under uncertainty, while considering contextual
parameters that are critical to technology deployment. We illustrate the core
capabilities of QSDsan through two distinct examples: (i) evaluation of a
complete sanitation value chain that compares three alternative systems; and
(ii) dynamic simulation of the wastewater treatment plant described in the
benchmark simulation model no. 1 (BSM1). Through these examples, we show the
utility of QSDsan to automate design, enable flexible process modeling, achieve
rapid and reproducible simulations, and to perform advanced statistical
analyses with integrated visualization. We strive to make QSDsan a

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has the potential to achieve this

whilst these advances are significant, the vast majority of focus has been on
the self-play paradigm. This often results in a coordination problem, caused by
agents learning to make use of arbitrary conventions when playing with
themselves. This means that even the strongest self-play agents may have very
low cross-play with other agents, including other initializations of the same

finite set of previously trained agents, to play with an unknown partner. We
propose an extension of the classic statistical technique, Gibbs sampling, to
update beliefs about other agents and obtain close to optimal ad-hoc

methods can be adopted for data shift, yet most of them are designed to only
encourage similar feature distribution between source and target data.
Conditional shift on classes can still affect such adaption. Fortunately, graph

propose Shift-Robust Node Classification (SRNC) to address these limitations.
We introduce an unsupervised cluster GNN on target graph to group the similar

optimized on training graph and adversarial samples on target graph, which are
generated by cluster GNN. We conduct experiments on both open-set shift and

policy-makers. Social media platforms enable the infodemic and there has been
an effort to curate the content on such platforms, analyze and debunk them.
While a majority of the research efforts consider one or two aspects (e.g.,
detecting factuality) of such information, in this study we focus on a
multifaceted approach, including an
API,\url{https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/yifan2019/Tanbih/0.8.0/} and a demo
system,\url{https://covid19.tanbih.org}, which we made freely and publicly
available. We believe that this will facilitate researchers and different
stakeholders. A screencast of the API services and demo is
available.\url{https://youtu.be/zhbcSvxEKMk}
