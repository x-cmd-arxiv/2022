  an Example",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) brought a fundamental shift into cloud
computing: (persistent) virtual machines have been replaced with dynamically
allocated resources, trading locality and statefulness for a pay-as-you-go
model more suitable for varying and infrequent workloads. However, adapting
services to functions in the serverless paradigm while still fulfilling
functional requirements is challenging. In this work, we demonstrate how
ZooKeeper, a centralized coordination service that offers a safe and wait-free
consensus mechanism, can be redesigned to benefit from serverless computing. We
define synchronization primitives to extend the capabilities of scalable cloud
storage and contribute a set of requirements for efficient and scalable FaaS
computing. We introduce FaaSKeeper, the first coordination service built on
serverless functions and cloud-native services, and share serverless design
lessons based on our experiences of implementing a ZooKeeper model deployable
to clouds today. FaaSKeeper provides the same consistency guarantees and
interface as ZooKeeper, with a serverless price model that lowers costs up to
450 times on infrequent workloads.

multiscale data representations that aim to encode meaningful abstractions. It
has proven effective for manifold learning, denoising, clustering, and
visualization of high-dimensional data. Diffusion condensation is constructed
as a time-inhomogeneous process where each step first computes and then applies
a diffusion operator to the data. We theoretically analyze the convergence and
evolution of this process from geometric, spectral, and topological
perspectives. From a geometric perspective, we obtain convergence bounds based
on the smallest transition probability and the radius of the data, whereas from
a spectral perspective, our bounds are based on the eigenspectrum of the
diffusion kernel. Our spectral results are of particular interest since most of
the literature on data diffusion is focused on homogeneous processes. From a
topological perspective, we show diffusion condensation generalizes
centroid-based hierarchical clustering. We use this perspective to obtain a
bound based on the number of data points, independent of their location. To
understand the evolution of the data geometry beyond convergence, we use
topological data analysis. We show that the condensation process itself defines
an intrinsic condensation homology. We use this intrinsic topology as well as
the ambient persistent homology of the condensation process to study how the
data changes over diffusion time. We demonstrate both types of topological
information in well-understood toy examples. Our work gives theoretical
insights into the convergence of diffusion condensation, and shows that it
provides a link between topological and geometric data analysis.

periodic lattices leads to a phase space reconfiguration that induces a
dynamical localization transition. The degenerate scar-mode spinors hybridize
and non-trivially localize around regular islands in phase space. In addition,
we find that the momentum coupling becomes maximal at the Brillouin zone

significantly altered. Our work pioneers the study of intertwining wave chaos

the final piece. The goal is to clear the board, i.e, make a sequence of

  We generalize this game to unbounded boards with $n$ pieces, each of which
have a given number of captures that they are permitted to make. We show that
Generalized Solo Chess is NP-complete, even when it is played by only rooks

played by rooks on a one-dimensional board, and b) played by pawns with two
captures left on a 2D board.
  Inspired by Generalized Solo Chess, we also introduce the Graph Capture Game,
which involves clearing a graph of tokens via captures along edges. This game
subsumes Generalized Solo Chess played by knights. We show that the Graph

ranging applications, from healthcare to the commercial sector. In addition to
signal processing approaches, methods for SER now also use deep learning
techniques which provide transfer learning possibilities. However, generalizing
over languages, corpora and recording conditions is still an open challenge. In
this work we address this gap by exploring loss functions that aid in
transferability, specifically to non-tonal languages. We propose a variational
autoencoder (VAE) with KL annealing and a semi-supervised VAE to obtain more
consistent latent embedding distributions across data sets. To ensure
transferability, the distribution of the latent embedding should be similar
across non-tonal languages (data sets). We start by presenting a low-complexity
SER based on a denoising-autoencoder, which achieves an unweighted
classification accuracy of over 52.09% for four-class emotion classification.
This performance is comparable to that of similar baseline methods. Following
this, we employ a VAE, the semi-supervised VAE and the VAE with KL annealing to
obtain a more regularized latent space. We show that while the DAE has the
highest classification accuracy among the methods, the semi-supervised VAE has
a comparable classification accuracy and a more consistent latent embedding
distribution over data sets.

  https://bit.ly/3rg6VsA",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Speech emotion recognition~(SER) refers to the technique of inferring the
emotional state of an individual from speech signals. SERs continue to garner
interest due to their wide applicability. Although the domain is mainly founded
on signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning, generalizing over
languages continues to remain a challenge. However, developing generalizable
and transferable models are critical due to a lack of sufficient resources in
terms of data and labels for languages beyond the most commonly spoken ones. To
improve performance over languages, we propose a denoising autoencoder with
semi-supervision using a continuous metric loss based on either activation or
valence. The novelty of this work lies in our proposal of continuous metric
learning, which is among the first proposals on the topic to the best of our
knowledge. Furthermore, to address the lack of activation and valence labels in
the transfer datasets, we annotate the signal samples with activation and
valence levels corresponding to a dimensional model of emotions, which were
then used to evaluate the quality of the embedding over the transfer datasets.
We show that the proposed semi-supervised model consistently outperforms the
baseline unsupervised method, which is a conventional denoising autoencoder, in
terms of emotion classification accuracy as well as correlation with respect to
the dimensional variables. Further evaluation of classification accuracy with
respect to the reference, a BERT based speech representation model, shows that
the proposed method is comparable to the reference method in classifying
specific emotion classes at a much lower complexity.

we hybridize the $H({\rm div})$-conforming finite element so that the velocity
lives in a standard $L^2$-DG space, and present a simple algebraic
preconditioner for the extended hybridized system. The proposed preconditioner
is optimal in $h$, super robust in element order (demonstrated up to 5th

algebraic multigrid methods available in many packages. The hybridization also
naturally extends to Navier--Stokes, providing a potential pathway to effective

its performance. Recent studies try to employ machine learning (ML) to solve
this problem, but suffer from two drawbacks. First, it takes a long time (high
overhead) to collect training samples. Second, the optimal configuration for
one input data size of the same application might not be optimal for others. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Bayesian Optimization (BO) based
approach named LOCAT to automatically tune the configurations of Spark SQL
applications online. LOCAT innovates three techniques. The first technique,
named QCSA, eliminates the configuration-insensitive queries by Query
Configuration Sensitivity Analysis (QCSA) when collecting training samples. The
second technique, dubbed DAGP, is a Datasize-Aware Gaussian Process (DAGP)
which models the performance of an application as a distribution of functions
of configuration parameters as well as input data size. The third technique,
called IICP, Identifies Important Configuration Parameters (IICP) with respect
to performance and only tunes the important ones. As such, LOCAT can tune the
configurations of a Spark SQL application with low overhead and adapt to
different input data sizes. We employ Spark SQL applications from benchmark
suites TPC-DS, TPC-H, and HiBench running on two significantly different
clusters, a four-node ARM cluster and an eight-node x86 cluster, to evaluate
LOCAT. The experimental results on the ARM cluster show that LOCAT accelerates
the optimization procedures of the state-of-the-art approaches by at least 4.1x

least 1.9x and up to 2.4x. On the x86 cluster, LOCAT shows similar results to

insufficient to distribute their data-changing argument functions over all of
the structure present in elements of deep GADTs, even just deep ADTs or nested
types. This paper develops an algorithm for detecting exactly which functions
are mappable over data whose types are (deep) GADTs. The algorithm takes as
input a term t whose type is an instance of a deep GADT D and a function f to
be mapped over t. It detects a minimal possible shape of t as an element of D,
and returns a minimal set of constraints f must satisfy to be mappable over t.
The crux of the algorithm is its ability to separate t's essential structure as
an element of D -- i.e., the part of t that is essential for it to have the
shape of an element of D -- from its incidental structure as an element of D --
i.e., the part of t that is simply data in the positions of this shape. The
algorithm ensures that the constraints on f come only from t's essential
structure. This work is part of an ongoing effort to define initial algebra
semantics for GADTs that properly generalizes the usual semantics for ADTs and
nested types as least fixpoints of higher-order endofunctors.

off-diagonal elements of the two-time Green's function. We partition the
two-time Green's function into a number of one-time functions along the
diagonal and subdiagonls of the two-time window as well as in horizontal and
vertical directions. We use DMD to construct separate reduced order models to
predict the dynamics of these one-time functions in a two-step procedure. We
extrapolate along diagonal and several subdiagonals within a subdiagonal band
of a two-time window in the first step. In the second step, we use DMD to
extrapolate the Green's function outside of the sub-diagonal band. We
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach by applying it to a
two-band Hubbard model problem.

polynomial system solving of minimal problems in structure from motion, image

of distinct solutions. Then, we use a heuristic greedy optimization strategy
over the space of parameters to get a template with a small size. We test our
method on 34 minimal problems in computer vision. For all of them, we found the
templates either of the same or smaller size compared to the state-of-the-art.
For some difficult examples, our templates are, e.g., 2.1, 2.5, 3.8, 6.6 times
smaller. For the problem of refractive absolute pose estimation with unknown
focal length, we have found a template that is 20 times smaller. Our
experiments on synthetic data also show that the new solvers are fast and

higher-dimensional phase-space of the system, i.e., its combined
momentum-position-time coordinates. Furthermore, we provide a connection

conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming method. Although the DAS
beamformer is well suited for PA image formation, reconstructed images are
often afflicted by noises, sidelobes, and other intense artifacts due to
inaccurate assumptions of PA signal correlation. The work aims to develop an
inversion method that reduces the occurrence of sidelobes and artifacts and
improves image quality performance. We present a novel beamformer based on
higher-order signal correlation, where more number of delayed PA signals are
combined and summed up than the conventional delay-multiply-and-sum (DMAS). The
proposed technique provides efficient improvements in resolution, contrast, and
SNR compared to the traditional beamformers. Computational complexity in this
method is shrunk to the same order of DAS $O(N)$. Therefore, this beamformer
can be implemented in real-time PA image reconstruction. A GPU based study was
performed on computation time. Proposed method almost executes in the same time
frame of DAS and real-time DMAS. A validation study of the algorithm was
accomplished both numerically and experimentally. Higher-order DMAS beamformers
demonstrate superior reconstruction in all cases. The quantitative evaluation
of the ex-vivo phantom shows that the proposed method leads to 51% and 6%
improvement in FWHM, 81% and 39% improvement in SNR compared to DAS and DMAS,
respectively. Conclusively, the proposed algorithm is very much potential and
promising in real-time photoacoustic imaging and its applications.

setup. However, open-set object detection (OSOD) remains challenging since
objects of unknown categories are often misclassified to existing known
classes. In this work, we propose to identify unknown objects by separating
high/low-density regions in the latent space, based on the consensus that
unknown objects are usually distributed in low-density latent regions. As
traditional threshold-based methods only maintain limited low-density regions,
which cannot cover all unknown objects, we present a novel Open-set Detector
(OpenDet) with expanded low-density regions. To this aim, we equip OpenDet with
two learners, Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and Unknown Probability Learner
(UPL). CFL performs instance-level contrastive learning to encourage compact
features of known classes, leaving more low-density regions for unknown
classes; UPL optimizes unknown probability based on the uncertainty of
predictions, which further divides more low-density regions around the cluster
of known classes. Thus, unknown objects in low-density regions can be easily
identified with the learned unknown probability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the OSOD performance,
e.g., OpenDet reduces the Absolute Open-Set Errors by 25%-35% on six OSOD
benchmarks. Code is available at: https://github.com/csuhan/opendet2.

two and three dimensions and the X-cube model in three dimensions, can be
related to their respective parent lattice gauge theories (LGT) through the
mathematical process of 'Higgsing'. Field theories of the low-energy
excitations of these spin models can be developed subsequently, building upon
the symmetry of the parent LGTs. Recently, two of the present authors proposed
a variant of the three-dimensional toric code which we now call the F3 model,
whose elementary excitations consist of freeon and fluxon excitations of the
three-dimensional toric code and fracton excitations of the X-cube model. In
this work, we identify the parent LGT of the F3 model as the hybrid rank-1 and
rank-2 U(1) LGT, and develop the corresponding field theory. The resulting
Lagrangian of the F3 model is that of a three-dimensional toric code with an
extra term, which ties the dynamics of fractons to that of fluxons. The matter
part of the effective action for the F3 model can be derived as well, by
carefully keeping track of the gauge invariance of the F3 model. Hydrodynamic
equations of motion of the quasiparticles are derived, which properly reflect
their constrained dynamics. Finally, we present a tight-binding model for the
quasiparticle motion in the F3 model.

labor-intensive if it relies on manual maintenance and updates. Therefore, we
target the taxonomy expansion task to attach new concepts to existing

into existing taxonomies. Our framework extracts hyponymy relations that
conform to users' intentions and cognition. Specifically, i) to fully exploit

Concretely, we leverage abstraction-based approaches to construct a supervisor

unverified controller, and a safety advisor that provides fallback control
inputs to ensure safety whenever the unverified controller is rejected.
Moreover, by leveraging an ($\epsilon,\delta$)-approximate probabilistic

disease) are unable to adequately capture temporal properties of the data such
as order and duration of evolving connections or dynamic likelihoods of
propagation along these connections. Temporal models in evolving networks are
crucial in many applications that need to analyze dynamic spread. For example,
a disease-spreading virus has varying transmissibility based on interactions
between individuals occurring over time with different frequency, proximity,
and venue population density. To capture such behaviors, we first develop the
Temporal Independent Cascade (T-IC) model and propose a novel spread function,
that we prove to be submodular, with a hypergraph-based sampling strategy that
efficiently utilizes dynamic propagation probabilities. We then introduce the
notion of 'reverse spread' using the proposed T-IC processes, and develop
solutions to identify both sentinel/detector nodes and highly susceptible
nodes. The proven guarantees of approximation quality enable scalable analysis
of highly granular temporal networks. Extensive experimental results on a
variety of real-world datasets show that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms the alternatives in modeling both if and how spread occurs, by
considering evolving network topology as well as granular contact/interaction
information. Our approach has numerous applications, including its utility for
the vital challenge of monitoring disease spread. Utilizing the proposed
methods and T-IC, we analyze the impact of various intervention strategies over
real spatio-temporal contact networks. Our approach is shown also to be highly
effective in quantifying the importance of superspreaders, designing targeted
restrictions for controlling spread, and backward contact tracing.

uses throughout computer science and engineering. The task of computing
connected components becomes more difficult when graphs are very large, or when
they are dynamic, meaning the edge set changes over time subject to a stream of
edge insertions and deletions. A natural approach to computing the connected
components on a large, dynamic graph stream is to buy enough RAM to store the
entire graph. However, the requirement that the graph fit in RAM is prohibitive
for very large graphs. Thus, there is an unmet need for systems that can
process dense dynamic graphs, especially when those graphs are larger than
available RAM.
  We present a new high-performance streaming graph-processing system for
computing the connected components of a graph. This system, which we call
GraphZeppelin, uses new linear sketching data structures (CubeSketches) to
solve the streaming connected components problem and as a result requires space
asymptotically smaller than the space required for a lossless representation of
the graph. GraphZeppelin is optimized for massive dense graphs: GraphZeppelin
can process millions of edge updates (both insertions and deletions) per
second, even when the underlying graph is far too large to fit in available
RAM. As a result GraphZeppelin vastly increases the scale of graphs that can be

locked in 1:1 spin-orbit resonance, a configuration where they exhibit

gradient, the climate and large-scale circulation of these planets are strongly
determined by their atmospheric stability against collapse, which designates
the runaway condensation of greenhouse gases. To better constrain the surface
conditions of rocky planets located in the habitable zone of their host star,
it is therefore crucial to elucidate the mechanisms that govern the day-night
heat redistribution. As a first attempt to bridge the gap between multiple
modelling approaches ranging from idealised models to 3-D General Circulation
Models (GCM), we developed a General Circulation Meta-Model (GCMM) able to
reproduce both the closed-form solutions provided by analytical models and the
numerical solutions obtained from GCM simulations. We used this approach to
characterise the atmospheric stability of Earth-sized rocky planets with dry
atmospheres containing CO2, and we benchmarked it against 3-D GCM simulations
using THOR GCM. We observe that the collapse pressure below which collapse
occurs can vary by ~40% around the value predicted by analytical scaling laws
depending on the mechanisms taken into account among radiative transfer,
atmospheric dynamics, and turbulent diffusion. Particularly, we find (i) that
the turbulent diffusion taking place in the dayside planetary boundary layer

transition zone between optically thin and optically thick regimes, (ii) that
the PBL also significantly affects the day-night advection timescale, and (iii)

not overlap: the quantum nature of light is typically neglected in works on
ultracold atoms. In our work the quantumness of both light and ultracold matter
plays a key role. First, we show that light is a quantum nondemolition (QND)
probe of many-body phases: they can be distinguished by correlations and full
distribution functions (we consider bosons, fermions, and dipolar molecules).
Light is not only sensitive to densities, but also to the matter-field
interference. Second, we prove that the measurement backaction constitutes a
novel source of competitions in many-body systems, especially, for non-QND
cases. This leads to a plethora of new phenomena: oscillations of multipartite
entangled modes, protection and break-up of fermion pairs, antiferromagnetic
orders, long-range pair tunnelling and entanglement beyond Hubbard models. We
prove that feedback control induces phase transitions and tunes their
universality class. Third, the quantization of trapping potential (quantum
optical lattices) leads to novel phases, including both density orders
(supersolids, density waves) and bond orders of matter fields (superfluid and
supersolid dimers, trimers). Results beyond ultracold atoms include: We extend
the paradigm of feedback control from the state control to control of phase
transitions. We present the measurement backaction as a novel source of
competitions in many-body physics. We merge quantum Zeno dynamics and
non-Hermitian physics and show a novel type of Zeno phenomena with Raman
transitions beyond Zeno dynamics. We propose quantum simulators based on
collective light-matter interaction. Our models can be applied to arrays of

scientists design new interpretable microscope architectures. Differentiable
microscopy first models a common physics-based optical system however with
trainable optical elements at key locations on the optical path. Using
pre-acquired data, we then train the model end-to-end for a task of interest.
The learnt design proposal can then be simplified by interpreting the learnt

we present an all-optical quantitative phase microscope (QPM) design that

experimentally verify the functionality of the optical 4-$f$ system based QPM
design using a spatial light modulator. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that
similar results can be achieved by an uninterpretable learning based method,
namely diffractive deep neural networks (D2NN). The proposed differentiable

in microscopy. To improve throughput, compressive imaging under-samples image
signals; the images are then computationally reconstructed by solving a

Learning based methods have achieved greater success in compression and image
quality. However, the information loss in the acquisition process sets the
compression bounds. Further improvement in compression, without compromising
the reconstruction quality is thus a challenge. In this work, we propose
differentiable compressive fluorescence microscopy ($\partial \mu$) which
includes a realistic generalizable forward model with learnable-physical
parameters (e.g. illumination patterns), and a novel physics-inspired inverse
model. The cascaded model is end-to-end differentiable and can learn optimal
compressive sampling schemes through training data. With our model, we
performed thousands of numerical experiments on various compressive microscope
configurations. We show that learned sampling encodes important information
about the specimens in the illumination field of the microscope allowing higher
compression up to $\times 1024$. We further utilize our framework for Task

applications, the LiDAR points used by mass-produced robots and vehicles
usually have fewer beams than that in large-scale public datasets. Moreover, as
the LiDARs are upgraded to other product models with different beam amount, it
becomes challenging to utilize the labeled data captured by previous versions'
high-resolution sensors. Despite the recent progress on domain adaptive 3D
detection, most methods struggle to eliminate the beam-induced domain gap. We
find that it is essential to align the point cloud density of the source domain
with that of the target domain during the training process. Inspired by this
discovery, we propose a progressive framework to mitigate the beam-induced
domain shift. In each iteration, we first generate low-beam pseudo LiDAR by
downsampling the high-beam point clouds. Then the teacher-student framework is
employed to distill rich information from the data with more beams. Extensive
experiments on Waymo, nuScenes and KITTI datasets with three different
LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness of our LiDAR Distillation.
Notably, our approach does not increase any additional computation cost for
inference.

frame-wise representations. Inspired by the recent progress of self-supervised

correlated views obtained through a series of spatio-temporal data
augmentations. SCL optimizes the embedding space by minimizing the
KL-divergence between the sequence similarity of two augmented views and a
prior Gaussian distribution of timestamp distance. Experiments on FineGym,
PennAction and Pouring datasets show that our method outperforms previous
state-of-the-art by a large margin for downstream fine-grained action

approach also shows outstanding performance on video alignment and fine-grained

II.Service resource selection and Response generation. The existing works
ignore the potential connection between these two phases. To model their
connection, Two-Phase Requirement Elicitation Method is proposed. For the phase
I, this paper proposes a user requirement elicitation framework (URef) to plan
a potential requirement sequence grounded on user profile and personal
knowledge base before the conversation. In addition, it can also predict user's
true requirement and judge whether the requirement is completed based on the

a response generation model based on attention, SaRSNet. It can select the

proof-of-principle analysis of a smaller preliminary data set published in a

  We present the first point-by-point extraction of a twist-3 PDF. The scalar
PDF, $e(x)$, is accessed through the analysis of the data for the
$\sin\phi_R$-moment of the beam-spin asymmetry for dihadron production in
semi-inclusive DIS off proton target at CLAS and CLAS12. The dihadron formalism
allows for use of collinear framework, hence calling for a minimal set of
approximations and hypotheses. The extracted PDF $e(x)$ carries insights into
the physics of the largely-unexplored quark-gluon correlations, and its first
Mellin moment is related to the marginally-known scalar charge of the nucleon.
We show that the proton flavor combination of the scalar PDF is non-zero at
more than $74\%$ probability.

that increases the gas mass resolution in the immediate neighborhood of the
black holes (BHs) to accurately resolve gas accretion. We do not include black
hole feedback in our simulations. We find that the complex and turbulent nature
of the SMUGGLE ISM leads to highly variable BH accretion. BH growth in SMUGGLE
converges at gas mass resolutions $\lesssim3\times10^3{\rm M_\odot}$. We show
that the low resolution simulations combined with the super-Lagrangian
refinement scheme are able to produce central gas dynamics and BH accretion
rates very similar to that of the uniform high resolution simulations. We
further explore BH fueling by simulating galaxy mergers. The interaction
between the galaxies causes an inflow of gas towards the galactic centres and
results in elevated and bursty star formation. The peak gas densities near the
BHs increase by orders of magnitude resulting in enhanced accretion. Our
results support the idea that galaxy mergers can trigger AGN activity, although
the instantaneous accretion rate depends strongly on the local ISM. We also
show that the level of merger-induced enhancement of BH fueling predicted by
the SMUGGLE model is much smaller compared to the predictions by simulations

self-consistently from inspiral to ignition, through the explosion, to
synthetic observables. We confirm that the primary white dwarf explodes
self-consistently. The helium detonation around the secondary white dwarf,
however, fails to ignite a carbon detonation. We restart the simulation
igniting the carbon detonation in the secondary white dwarf by hand and compare
the ejecta and observables of both explosions. We find that the outer ejecta at
$v~>~15\,000$\,km\,s$^{-1}$ are indistinguishable. Light curves and spectra are
very similar until $\sim~40\,\mathrm{d}$ after explosion and the ejecta are
much more spherical than violent merger models. The inner ejecta differ
significantly slowing down the decline rate of the bolometric light curve after
maximum of the model with a secondary explosion by $\sim20$ per cent. We expect
future synthetic 3D nebular spectra to confirm or rule out either model.

chemical abundances to tag stars that formed within the same stellar

expected results, especially within the thin disk where open stellar clusters
have chemical patterns that are difficult to disentangle. The ultimate goal of
this study is to probe the feasibility of chemical tagging within the thin disk
population using high-quality data from a controlled sample of stars. We also
aim at improving the existing techniques of chemical tagging and giving
guidance on different strategies of clustering analysis in the elemental

members through clustering analysis in the elemental abundance space using the
OPTICS algorithm applied to data from the Gaia-ESO survey. First, we evaluate
different strategies of analysis, determining which ones are more performing.
Second, we apply these methods to a data set including both field stars and
open clusters attempting a blind recover of as many open clusters as possible.
We show how specific strategies of data analysis can improve the final results.
Specifically, we demonstrate that open clusters can be more efficaciously
recovered with the Manhattan metric and on a space whose dimensions are
carefully selected. Using these (and other) prescriptions we are able to
recover open clusters hidden in our data set and find new members of these
stellar associations. Our results indicate that there are chances of recovering
open clusters' members via clustering analysis in the elemental abundance

(CFT) at long distances, it is crucial to understand the universal conformal
data. One most important ingredient is the operator product expansion (OPE)
coefficients, which describe how operators fuse into each other. It has been
proposed in [Zou, Vidal, Phys. Rev. B 105, 125125] that the OPE coefficients
can be computed from overlaps of low-energy wavefunctions of the spin chain. In
this work, we establish that all conformal data including central charge,
conformal dimensions, and OPE coefficients are encoded in the wavefunction
overlaps, with universal finite-size corrections that depend on the operator
content of the cyclic orbifold CFT. Thus this method allows us to numerically
compute all the conformal data based solely on the low-energy eigenstates. The
predictions are verified in the Ising and XXZ model. As an application, we
study the recently proposed Haagerup model built from the Haagerup fusion
category. We find that the CFT has central charge $c \approx 2.1$ and the
lowest spin-$1$ operator in the twisted sector has scaling dimension $1 <
\Delta_J \leq 1.4$.

accretion flows onto a black hole (BH) at rates substantially higher than the
Eddington value ($\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), performing two-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations with and without radiative diffusion. In the
high-accretion optically-thick limit, where the radiation energy is efficiently
trapped within the inflow, the accretion flow becomes adiabatic and comprises
of turbulent gas in the equatorial region and strong bipolar outflows. As a
result, the mass inflow rate decreases toward the center as $\dot{M}_{\rm
in}\propto r^{p}$ with $p\sim 0.5-0.7$ and a small fraction of the inflowing
gas feeds the nuclear BH. Thus, super-Eddington accretion is sustained only
when a larger amount of gas is supplied from larger radii at $>
100-1000~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. The global structure of the flow settles down to a
quasi-steady state in millions of the orbital timescale at the BH event
horizon, which is $> 10-100$ times longer than that addressed in previous
(magneto-)RHD simulation studies. Energy transport via radiative diffusion
accelerates the outflow near the poles in the inner region but does not change
the overall properties of the accretion flow compared to the cases without
diffusion. Based on our simulation results, we provide a mechanical feedback
model for super-Eddington accreting BHs. This can be applied as a sub-grid
model in large-scale cosmological simulations that do not sufficiently resolve
galactic nuclei, and to the formation of the heaviest gravitational-wave
sources via accretion in dense environments.

a pure state there are properties it possesses with certainty, known as actual
properties. The actual properties of a quantum system (in a pure state) fully
determine the probability of finding the system to have any other property. We
call this feature intermediate determinism. In dimensions of at least three,
the intermediate determinism of quantum theory is guaranteed by the structure
of its lattice of properties. This observation follows from Gleason's theorem,
which is why it fails to hold in dimension two. In this work we extend the idea
of intermediate determinism from properties to measurements. Under this
extension intermediate determinism follows from the structure of quantum
effects for separable Hilbert spaces of any dimension, including dimension two.
Then, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for a general probabilistic

model developed by simultaneously solving the non-isothermal
Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes equations with the lubrication theory.
Particularly, this paper clarifies the interplay and relative importance of the
thermoelectric mechanisms due to (a) the convective transport of ions caused by
the fluid flow, (b) the dependence of ion electrophoretic mobility on
temperature, (c) the difference in the intrinsic Soret coefficients of cation
and anion. Additionally, synergy conditions for the three thermoelectric
mechanisms to fully cooperate are proposed for thermo-phobic/philic
electrolytes. The temperature-gradient-driven electrokinetic flow is shown to
be a nearly unidirectional flow whose axial velocity profiles vary with the
axial location. Also, the flow can be regarded as a consequence of the
counteraction or cooperation between a thermoelectric-field-driven
electroosmotic flow and a thermo-osmotic flow driven by the osmotic pressure
gradient and dielectric body force. Moreover, the Seebeck coefficient and the
fluid average velocity are demonstrated to be affected by electrolyte-related
parameters. The results are beneficial for understanding the
temperature-gradient-driven electrokinetic transport in nanocapillaries and

Our calculations allow us identifying the velocity terms as the leading

cosmological velocity fields. Just like for standard 2D clustering, the impact
of gravitational lensing on ARF is dominant on small angular scales and for
wide redshift shells, while the signatures associated to gravitational
potentials are extremely small and hardly detectable. The ARF also present
interesting correlation properties to anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB): they are highly correlated to CMB lensing potential
fluctuations, while also exhibiting a significant (S/N$\sim 4$-$5$) {\em
anti-}correlation with the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW). This negative
ARF$\times$ISW signal is quite complementary to the standard 2D
clustering$\times$ISW correlation, since the former appears mostly at higher
redshift ($z\sim 2$) than the latter ($z\lesssim 1)$, and the combination of

transition as their exchange coupling to the conduction electrons increases.
For quantum spins, this transition is accompanied by screening of the adatom
spin. Here, we explore the consequences of this screening for the phase
diagrams and subgap excitation spectra of dimers of magnetic adatoms coupled by
hybridization of their Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states and spin-spin interactions. We
specifically account for higher spins, single-ion anisotropy,
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida coupling, and Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interactions
relevant in transition-metal and rare-earth systems. Our flexible approach
based on a zero-bandwidth approximation provides detailed physical insight and
is in excellent qualitative agreement with available numerical-renormalization
group calculations on monomers and dimers. Remarkably, we find that even in the
limit of large impurity spins or strong single-ion anisotropy, the phase
diagrams for dimers of quantum spins remain qualitatively distinct from phase
diagrams based on classical spins, highlighting the need for a theory of
quantum Yu-Shiba-Rusinov dimers.

Interactive Learning with a pretrained segmentation model from a different

from cancer and non-cancer regions on giga-pixel whole slide images, an
iterative process of annotating mislabeled regions from a segmentation model
and training/finetuning the model with the additional annotation can reduce the
time. Especially, employing a pretrained segmentation model can further reduce
the time than starting annotation from scratch. We trained an accurate ovarian
cancer segmentation model with a pretrained breast segmentation model by 3.5

a set of exact solutions of Higgs field theory recently devised, in terms of

massive dispersion relation. In certain regions of the parameter space,
determined by the quartic coupling value, we show that such solutions have the
property to give the correct behavior for the equation of state of the dark

Hubble constant and the strength of the self-interaction of the scalar field,
when conformal invariance is restored, the equation of state for the dark
energy becomes manifest. Further we investigate scenarios within standard field
theory framework and also extending to higher-derivative theories, namely
infinite-derivative theory, motivated from p-adic string field theory, and
Lee-Wick theories and in all cases, we find suitable choices of the parameter

both heterogeneous mean-field theory and stochastic simulations. The former
performs well for the global rule, but misses relevant outcomes of simulations

the effectiveness in mitigating the outbreak. We also report that network
heterogeneity substantially reduces the efficacy of local awareness mechanisms

We present a novel approach based on tree search and graph machine learning for
the scheduling problem known as Disjunctive Temporal Networks with Uncertainty
(DTNU). Dynamic Controllability (DC) of DTNUs seeks a reactive scheduling
strategy to satisfy temporal constraints in response to uncontrollable action
durations. We introduce new semantics for reactive scheduling: Time-based
Dynamic Controllability (TDC) and a restricted subset of TDC, R-TDC. We design
a tree search algorithm to determine whether or not a DTNU is R-TDC. Moreover,
we leverage a graph neural network as a heuristic for tree search guidance.
Finally, we conduct experiments on a known benchmark on which we show R-TDC to
retain significant completeness with regard to DC, while being faster to prove.
This results in the tree search processing fifty percent more DTNU problems in
R-TDC than the state-of-the-art DC solver does in DC with the same time budget.
We also observe that graph neural network search guidance leads to substantial
performance gains on benchmarks of more complex DTNUs, with up to eleven times
more problems solved than the baseline tree search.

  Precision Matrix Estimation via Scaled Lasso","To appear in Computational Statistics",,,,"stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The sparse precision matrix plays an essential role in the Gaussian graphical
model since a zero off-diagonal element indicates conditional independence of
the corresponding two variables given others. In the Gaussian graphical model,
many methods have been proposed, and their theoretical properties are given as
well. Among these, the sparse precision matrix estimation via scaled lasso
(SPMESL) has an attractive feature in which the penalty level is automatically
set to achieve the optimal convergence rate under the sparsity and
invertibility conditions. Conversely, other methods need to be used in
searching for the optimal tuning parameter. Despite such an advantage, the
SPMESL has not been widely used due to its expensive computational cost. In
this paper, we develop a GPU-parallel coordinate descent (CD) algorithm for the
SPMESL and numerically show that the proposed algorithm is much faster than the
least angle regression (LARS) tailored to the SPMESL. Several comprehensive
numerical studies are conducted to investigate the scalability of the proposed
algorithm and the estimation performance of the SPMESL. The results show that
the SPMESL has the lowest false discovery rate for all cases and the best
performance in the case where the level of the sparsity of the columns is high.

multiple subtasks (or sub-goals) that are dependent on each other. These
subtasks are defined in terms of entities (e.g., ""apple"", ""pear"") that can be
recombined to form new subtasks (e.g., ""pickup apple"", and ""pickup pear""). To
solve these tasks efficiently, an agent must infer subtask dependencies (e.g.
an agent must execute ""pickup apple"" before ""place apple in pot""), and
generalize the inferred dependencies to new subtasks (e.g. ""place apple in pot""
is similar to ""place apple in pan""). Moreover, an agent may also need to solve
unseen tasks, which can involve unseen entities. To this end, we formulate
parameterized subtask graph inference (PSGI), a method for modeling subtask
dependencies using first-order logic with subtask entities. To facilitate this,
we learn entity attributes in a zero-shot manner, which are used as quantifiers
(e.g. ""is_pickable(X)"") for the parameterized subtask graph. We show this
approach accurately learns the latent structure on hierarchical and
compositional tasks more efficiently than prior work, and show PSGI can
generalize by modelling structure on subtasks unseen during adaptation.

successfully find a match. However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch (VM) --
which has facilitated millions of connections between volunteers and nonprofits
-- a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives directly to a nonprofit's
volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform's
recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for this
external traffic in the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the
goal of maximizing successful matches. We model the platform's problem as a
special case of online matching, where (using VM terminology) volunteers arrive
sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which
has finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is
interested only in their targeted opportunity; by contrast, internal traffic
may be interested in many opportunities, and the platform's online algorithm
selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating different algorithms, we
parameterize the competitive ratio based on the amount of external traffic.
After demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly-used algorithm that is
optimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm --
Adaptive Capacity (AC) -- which accounts for matches differently based on
whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower
bound on AC's competitive ratio that is increasing in the amount of external
traffic and that is close to the parameterized upper bound we establish on the
competitive ratio of any online algorithm. Our analysis utilizes a path-based,
pseudo-rewards approach, which we further generalize to settings where the
platform can recommend a ranked set of opportunities. Beyond our theoretical
results, we show the strong performance of AC in a case study motivated by VM
data.

This distinctive codification allows our proposal to depict all the fundamental

and the Bu\v zek-Hillery universal quantum cloning machine, observing a faster
average convergence of the former, but better final populations of the latter.
Additionally, we analyzed the effect of introducing a mutation subroutine,
concluding a minor impact on the average performance. Furthermore, we introduce
a quantum channel analysis to prove the exponential convergence of our
algorithm and even predict its convergence-ratio. This tool could be extended
to formally prove results on the convergence of general non-unitary

sound-radiating hemisphere based on the pipe's open end and enclosing a vortex
ring. In this way we obtain not only a physical explanation of sound radiation

must be determined during the design of water-cooled reactors to ensure safety
of operation. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to predict the CHF in
VVER rod bundles. A whole-reactor model of VVER-1000 is implemented in
RELAP-SCDAPSIM, and, based on the bundle-average approach, the parameters of
the hot channel are used to assess four CHF predictors (i.e., the 2006
Groeneveld look-up table (LUT), and the Bowring, W-3, Biasi, and OKB-Gidropress
correlations) upon comparison with the 2011 Bobkov LUT. A brief critique is
given of the correction factors for both the Groeneveld and Bobkov LUTs. The
effects of channel diameter and non-uniform axial heat flux on the predicted
values of CHF in subcooled conditions are also studied. The performance and
time complexity of the standard and Bourke trilinear interpolation algorithms
are assessed for use with LUTs in safety codes. It has been concluded that the
non-uniform axial heat flux does not affect the CHF in subcooled conditions and
that the Groeneveld diameter factor exponent gives better predictability of the
CHF in VVER rod bundles over the Tanase and Wong exponent correlations.
Additionally, the Groeneveld LUT has been found to nearly reproduces the Bobkov
LUT CHF values when used in conjunction with the Bobkov heated length factor.
Values of MDNBR equal to 1.83 and 1.96 can be used as thermal limits at 12\%
overpower when the Bowring and W-3 correlations, respectively, are used in
subcooled conditions. The standard and Bourke algorithms nearly exhibit the
same average CPU time. The Bourke algorithm, however, is less affected by
noise. Further research is needed to ensure the smoothness of the Bobkov LUT
and to derive reactor type-dependent correction factor formulas for use with
the Groeneveld LUT.

nature of its constituents. If a material body is immersed into such a medium,
its shape and the properties of its constituents modify the properties of the
surrounding medium and its fluctuations. If in the same medium there is a
second body then -- in addition to all direct interactions between them -- the
modifications due to the first body influence the modifications due to the
second body. This mutual influence results in a force between these bodies. If
the excitations of the medium, which mediate the effective interaction between
the bodies, are massless, this force is long-ranged and nowadays known as a
Casimir force. If the fluctuating medium consists of the confined
electromagnetic field in vacuum, one speaks of the quantum mechanical Casimir
effect. In the case that the order parameter of material fields fluctuates -
such as differences of number densities or concentrations - and that the
corresponding fluctuations of the order parameter are long-ranged, one speaks
of the critical Casimir effect. This holds, e.g., in the case of systems which
undergo a second-order phase transition and which are thermodynamically located
near the corresponding critical point, or for systems with a continuous
symmetry exhibiting Goldstone mode excitations. Here we review the currently
available exact results concerning the critical Casimir effect in systems
encompassing the one-dimensional Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models, the
two-dimensional Ising model, the Gaussian and the spherical models, as well as
the mean field results for the Ising and the XY model. Special attention is
paid to the influence of the boundary conditions on the behavior of the Casimir

liquid-crystal metasurfaces. By exploiting spin-orbit effects, these implement
space-dependent polarization transformations that mix circularly polarized
optical modes carrying quantized transverse momentum. As each metasurface
implements long-range couplings between distant modes, by using only a few of
them we simulate quantum walks up to 320 discrete steps without any optical
amplification, far beyond state-of-the-art experiments. To showcase the
potential of this method, we experimentally demonstrate that in the long-time
limit a quantum walk affected by dynamical disorder generates maximal
entanglement between two system partitions. Our platform grants experimental
access to large-scale unitary evolutions while keeping optical losses at a
minimum, thereby paving the way to massive multi-photon multi-mode quantum

plan minimum-time trajectories; yet, the trajectories are executed with control

classical topological path planning to train robust neural-network controllers

solves the planning and control problem simultaneously online to account for

70\%$ of cosmic baryons at $z=0$ are in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium
(WHIM) driven by jet feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). By comparing a
full-physics Simba run versus one with jets turned off, we find that jet
feedback causes widespread heating that impacts the absorption morphology
particularly of the higher ions. However, the distribution of the physical
properties of detectable absorbers are not dramatically affected. Higher
ionisation absorbers probe hotter gas as expected, but in Simba all ions arise
at similar overdensities (typically $\delta\sim20-30$), similar environments
(predominantly filaments), and similar nearest-halo distances (typically
$\sim2-3r_{200c}$). Simba matches the observed Ovi column density distribution
function (CDDF) fairly well, but under-predicts the CDDF preliminarily derived
from two detected intergalactic Ovii absorbers. Predicted CDDFs are very
similar at $z=1$ with or without jets, but show differences by $z=0$
particularly at the high-column end. Despite some discrepancies, Simba
reproduces available observations as well as or better than other comparable
simulations, suggesting that Simba's widespread jet heating cannot be ruled out
by these data. These results offer hope that future X-ray and ultraviolet

acquisition and the real-time processing of high-resolution tactile information
from a hand-shaped multi-sensor array for prosthetic and robotic applications.
During data collection, our system can deliver a high throughput of 100 frames
per second, which is 13.7x higher than previous related work. We collected a
new tactile dataset while interacting with daily-life objects during five
different sessions. We propose a compact yet accurate convolutional neural
network that requires one order of magnitude less memory and 15.6x fewer
computations compared to related work without degrading classification
accuracy. The top-1 and top-3 cross-validation accuracies are respectively
98.86% and 99.83%. We further analyze the inter-session variability and obtain
the best top-3 leave-one-out-validation accuracy of 77.84%. We deploy the
trained model on a high-performance ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller achieving an
inference time of only 100 ms minimizing the response latency. The overall
measured power consumption is 505 mW. Finally, we fabricate a new control
sensor and perform additional experiments to provide analyses on sensor
degradation and slip detection. This work is a step forward in giving robotic
and prosthetic devices a sense of touch and demonstrates the practicality of a
smart embedded system empowered by tiny machine learning.

seabed environment. Moreover, deep learning has demonstrated superior ability
in finding robust features for automating imagery analysis. However, the
success of deep learning is conditioned on having lots of labeled training
data, but obtaining generous pixel-level annotations of SAS imagery is often
practically infeasible. This challenge has thus far limited the adoption of
deep learning methods for SAS segmentation. Algorithms exist to segment SAS
imagery in an unsupervised manner, but they lack the benefit of
state-of-the-art learning methods and the results present significant room for
improvement. In view of the above, we propose a new iterative algorithm for
unsupervised SAS image segmentation combining superpixel formation, deep
learning, and traditional clustering methods. We call our method Iterative Deep
Unsupervised Segmentation (IDUS). IDUS is an unsupervised learning framework
that can be divided into four main steps: 1) A deep network estimates class
assignments. 2) Low-level image features from the deep network are clustered
into superpixels. 3) Superpixels are clustered into class assignments (which we
call pseudo-labels) using $k$-means. 4) Resulting pseudo-labels are used for
loss backpropagation of the deep network prediction. These four steps are
performed iteratively until convergence. A comparison of IDUS to current
state-of-the-art methods on a realistic benchmark dataset for SAS image
segmentation demonstrates the benefits of our proposal even as the IDUS incurs
a much lower computational burden during inference (actual labeling of a test
image). Finally, we also develop a semi-supervised (SS) extension of IDUS
called IDSS and demonstrate experimentally that it can further enhance
performance while outperforming supervised alternatives that exploit the same
labeled training imagery.

such, Majorana modes serve as the basic primitive of topological quantum
computing, providing resilience to errors. However, their demonstration on
quantum hardware has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a verifiable
identification and braiding of topological Majorana modes using a
superconducting quantum processor as a quantum simulator. By simulating
fermions on a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic drive, we confirm
the existence of Majorana modes localized at the edges, and distinguish them

function between a text and a video that ranks relevant text-video pairs higher
than irrelevant pairs. However, videos inherently express a much wider gamut of
information than texts. Instead, texts often capture sub-regions of entire
videos and are most semantically similar to certain frames within videos.
Therefore, for a given text, a retrieval model should focus on the text's most
semantically similar video sub-regions to make a more relevant comparison. Yet,
most existing works aggregate entire videos without directly considering text.
Common text-agnostic aggregations schemes include mean-pooling or
self-attention over the frames, but these are likely to encode misleading
visual information not described in the given text. To address this, we propose
a cross-modal attention model called X-Pool that reasons between a text and the
frames of a video. Our core mechanism is a scaled dot product attention for a
text to attend to its most semantically similar frames. We then generate an
aggregated video representation conditioned on the text's attention weights
over the frames. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT,
MSVD and LSMDC, achieving new state-of-the-art results by up to 12% in relative

physical features that control the GFA are still not well understood. For
example, it is well-known that mixtures are better glass-formers than
monodisperse systems and that particle size and cohesive energy differences
among constituents improve the GFA, but it is not currently known how particle
size differences couple to cohesive energy differences to determine the GFA. We
perform molecular dynamics simulations to determine the GFA of equimolar,
binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) mixtures versus the normalized cohesive energy
difference $\epsilon_\_$ and mixing energy $\bar \epsilon_{AB}$ between
particles A and B. We find several important results. First, the $\log_{10}
R_c$ contours in the $\bar \epsilon_{AB}$-$\epsilon_\_$ plane are ellipsoidal
for all diameter ratios, and thus $R_c$ is determined by the Mahalanobis
distance $d_M$ from a given point in the $\bar \epsilon_{AB}$-$\epsilon_\_$
plane to the center of the ellipsoidal contours. Second, LJ systems for which
the larger particles have larger cohesive energy are generally better glass
formers than those for which the larger particles have smaller cohesive energy.
Third, $d_M(\epsilon_\_,\bar \epsilon_{AB})$ is determined by the relative
Voronoi volume difference between particles and local chemical order $S_{AB}$,
which gives the average fraction of nearest-neighbor B particles surrounding an
A particle and vice-versa. In particular, the shifted Mahalanobis distance $d_M

modeling dynamic objects explicitly, for instance via estimating pixel-wise 3D

depth and scene flow is ill-posed, as there are infinitely many combinations

capable of jointly learning depth, optical flow, and scene flow by combining
synthetic data with geometric self-supervision. Building upon the RAFT

the interaction of the training dataset and the model. In particular, we
introduce \textit{confusion score} as a label-free measure of image difficulty
which quantifies the amount of disagreement on a given test image based on the
class conditional probabilities estimated by an ensemble of trained models.
Using the confusion score, we investigate CIFAR-10 and its OOD derivatives.
Next, by partitioning test and OOD datasets via their confusion scores, we
predict the relationship between ID and OOD accuracies for various
architectures. This allows us to obtain an estimator of the OOD accuracy of a
given model only using ID test labels. Our observations indicate that the
biggest contribution to the accuracy drop comes from images with high confusion
scores. Upon further inspection, we report on the nature of the misclassified
images grouped by their confusion scores: \textit{(i)} images with high
confusion scores contain \textit{weak spurious correlations} that appear in
multiple classes in the training data and lack clear \textit{class-specific

designs (FCN based or attention based) and mask decoding strategies (parametric

considering the softmax weights or query vectors as learnable class prototypes.
In light of this prototype view, this study uncovers several limitations of
such parametric segmentation regime, and proposes a nonparametric alternative
based on non-learnable prototypes. Instead of prior methods learning a single
weight/query vector for each class in a fully parametric manner, our model
represents each class as a set of non-learnable prototypes, relying solely on
the mean features of several training pixels within that class. The dense
prediction is thus achieved by nonparametric nearest prototype retrieving. This
allows our model to directly shape the pixel embedding space, by optimizing the
arrangement between embedded pixels and anchored prototypes. It is able to
handle arbitrary number of classes with a constant amount of learnable
parameters. We empirically show that, with FCN based and attention based
segmentation models (i.e., HRNet, Swin, SegFormer) and backbones (i.e., ResNet,
HRNet, Swin, MiT), our nonparametric framework yields compelling results over
several datasets (i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff), and performs well in

MagnetO that uses activations from the pooling layer of the trained deep

and offset prediction neural networks. An additional focus of this research is
to estimate the impact of score normalization on the calibration performance of

if in-domain development data are used for calibration tuning. Otherwise, a
trade-off between good calibration performance and threshold-free system
quality arises. In most cases using adaptive s-norm helps to stabilize score
distributions and to improve system performance. Meanwhile, some experiments
demonstrate that novel approaches have their limits in score stabilization on

function is an oriented distance function in state-action space where it
describes the signed distance to success or failure. The motion planning
problem is formed as a nonlinear program with constraints that enforce the
approximated forward dynamics and the validity of state-action pairs. For
illustration, this method is applied to create a planner for an actuated
spring-loaded inverted pendulum model. In an ablation study, the failure margin
constraints decreased the number of invalid solutions by between 24 and 47

  Stochastic Trip Requests for Paratransit Services","Accepted for publication at ICCPS 2022",,,,"cs.AI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many transit agencies operating paratransit and microtransit services have to
respond to trip requests that arrive in real-time, which entails solving hard
combinatorial and sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. To
avoid decisions that lead to significant inefficiency in the long term,
vehicles should be allocated to requests by optimizing a non-myopic utility
function or by batching requests together and optimizing a myopic utility
function. While the former approach is typically offline, the latter can be
performed online. We point out two major issues with such approaches when
applied to paratransit services in practice. First, it is difficult to batch
paratransit requests together as they are temporally sparse. Second, the
environment in which transit agencies operate changes dynamically (e.g.,
traffic conditions), causing estimates that are learned offline to become
stale. To address these challenges, we propose a fully online approach to solve
the dynamic vehicle routing problem (DVRP) with time windows and stochastic
trip requests that is robust to changing environmental dynamics by
construction. We focus on scenarios where requests are relatively sparse - our
problem is motivated by applications to paratransit services. We formulate DVRP
as a Markov decision process and use Monte Carlo tree search to evaluate
actions for any given state. Accounting for stochastic requests while
optimizing a non-myopic utility function is computationally challenging;
indeed, the action space for such a problem is intractably large in practice.
To tackle the large action space, we leverage the structure of the problem to
design heuristics that can sample promising actions for the tree search. Our
experiments using real-world data from our partner agency show that the
proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both in
terms of performance and robustness.

carrying out empathic conversations, due to difficulties of AI systems in
understanding complex human emotions and the open-ended nature of these tasks.
Here, we focus on peer-to-peer mental health support, a setting in which
empathy is critical for success, and examine how AI can collaborate with humans
to facilitate peer empathy during textual, online supportive conversations. We
develop Hailey, an AI-in-the-loop agent that provides just-in-time feedback to
help participants who provide support (peer supporters) respond more
empathically to those seeking help (support seekers). We evaluate Hailey in a
non-clinical randomized controlled trial with real-world peer supporters on
TalkLife (N=300), a large online peer-to-peer support platform. We show that
our Human-AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.60% increase in
conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger
38.88% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who
self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically
analyze the Human-AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are
able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming
overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback. Our
findings demonstrate the potential of feedback-driven, AI-in-the-loop writing
systems to empower humans in open-ended, social, creative tasks such as
empathic conversations.

mixture, and establish tight bounds on the sample complexity for learning the
component distributions in such models. Namely, we are given i.i.d. samples
from a pdf $f$ where $$ f=\sum_{i=1}^k w_i f_i, \quad\sum_{i=1}^k w_i=1, \quad
w_i>0 $$ and we are interested in learning each component $f_i$. Without any
assumptions on $f_i$, this problem is ill-posed. In order to identify the
components $f_i$, we assume that each $f_i$ can be written as a convolution of
a Gaussian and a compactly supported density $\nu_i$ with
$\text{supp}(\nu_i)\cap \text{supp}(\nu_j)=\emptyset$.
  Our main result shows that $(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{\Omega(\log\log

parametric mixtures, the difficulty does not arise from the order $k$ or small
weights $w_i$, and unlike nonparametric density estimation it does not arise
from the curse of dimensionality, irregularity, or inhomogeneity. The proof
relies on a fast rate for approximation with Gaussians, which may be of
independent interest. To show this is tight, we also propose an algorithm that
uses $(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{O(\log\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})}$ samples to
estimate each $f_i$. Unlike existing approaches to learning latent variable
models based on moment-matching and tensor methods, our proof instead involves
a delicate analysis of an ill-conditioned linear system via orthogonal
functions. Combining these bounds, we conclude that the optimal sample
complexity of this problem properly lies in between polynomial and exponential,
which is not common in learning theory.

complication in diabetic patients associated with painful neuropathy, foot
ulceration and amputation. The Michigan neuropathy screening instrument (MNSI)
is one of the most common screening techniques for DSPN, however, it does not
provide any direct severity grading system. Method: For designing and modelling
the DSPN severity grading systems for MNSI, 19 years of data from Epidemiology
of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) clinical trials were used.
MNSI variables and patient outcomes were investigated using machine learning
tools to identify the features having higher association in DSPN
identification. A multivariable logistic regression-based nomogram was
generated and validated for DSPN severity grading. Results: The top-7 ranked
features from MNSI: 10-gm filament, Vibration perception (R), Vibration
perception (L), previous diabetic neuropathy, the appearance of deformities,
appearance of callus and appearance of fissure were identified as key features
for identifying DSPN using the extra tree model. The area under the curve (AUC)
of the nomogram for the internal and external datasets were 0.9421 and 0.946,
respectively. From the developed nomogram, the probability of having DSPN was
predicted and a DSPN severity scoring system for MNSI was developed from the
probability score. The model performance was validated on an independent
dataset. Patients were stratified into four severity levels: absent, mild,
moderate, and severe using a cut-off value of 10.5, 12.7 and 15 for a DSPN
probability less than 50%, 75% to 90%, and above 90%, respectively.
Conclusions: This study provides a simple, easy-to-use and reliable algorithm
for defining the prognosis and management of patients with DSPN.

transmission framework is proposed with the novel concept of cluster-free
successive interference cancellation (SIC). In contrast to conventional NOMA
approaches, where SIC is successively carried out within the same cluster, the
key idea is that the SIC can be flexibly implemented between any arbitrary
users to achieve efficient interference elimination. Based on the proposed
framework, a sum rate maximization problem is formulated for jointly optimizing
the transmit beamforming and the SIC operations between users, subject to the
SIC decoding conditions and users' minimal data rate requirements. To tackle
this highly-coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating
direction method of multipliers-successive convex approximation (ADMM-SCA)
algorithm is developed. The original problem is first reformulated into a
tractable biconvex augmented Lagrangian (AL) problem by handling the non-convex
terms via SCA. Then, this AL problem is decomposed into two subproblems that
are iteratively solved by the ADMM to obtain the stationary solution. Moreover,
to reduce the computational complexity and alleviate the parameter
initialization sensitivity of ADMM-SCA, a Matching-SCA algorithm is proposed.
The intractable binary SIC operations are solved through an extended
many-to-many matching, which is jointly combined with an SCA process to
optimize the transmit beamforming. The proposed Matching-SCA can converge to an
enhanced exchange-stable matching that guarantees the local optimality.
Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed Matching-SCA algorithm
achieves comparable performance and a faster convergence compared to ADMM-SCA;
ii) the proposed generalized framework realizes scenario-adaptive
communications and outperforms traditional multi-antenna NOMA approaches in
various communication regimes.

when formed from the remnant of a collapsing star. However, the evidence for
whether black holes (BH) receive natal kicks is less clear, reliant on weak
constraints from the analysis of BH X-ray binaries and massive runaway and
walkaway stars. Here we show for the first time that recent microlensing
detections offer a new method for measuring the kicks BHs receive at birth.
When a BH is identified through both photometric and astrometric microlensing
and when the lensed star has a known distance and proper motion, the mass,
distance and proper motion of the BH can be determined. We study the runaway
velocities for components of eccentric binaries disrupted during a supernova,
finding the peculiar velocity correlates strongly with the kick a BH received a
birth, typically within 20\%, even when the natal kick is smaller than the
orbital velocity. Therefore, by measuring the peculiar velocity of a BH or
other compact object that formed from a binary that disrupted during core
collapse, we are in effect measuring the natal kick that object received. We
focus on MOA-2011-BLG-191/OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, an isolated, single BH detected

its formation from the disruption of a binary during a supernova event. We

replace an unbounded state space with a ""truncated"" bounded state space. When
such a replacement is made, one often wants to know whether the equilibrium
behavior of the truncated chain or process is close to that of the untruncated
system. For example, such questions arise naturally when considering numerical
methods for computing stationary distributions on unbounded state space. In
this paper, we study general truncation-augmentation schemes, in which the
substochastic truncated ""northwest corner"" of the transition matrix or kernel
is stochasticized (or augmented) arbitrarily. In the presence of a Lyapunov
condition involving a coercive function, we show that such schemes are
generally convergent in countable state space, provided that the truncation is
chosen as a sublevel set of the Lyapunov function. For stochastically monotone
Markov chains on $\mathbb Z_+$, we prove that we can always choose the
truncation sets to be of the form $\{0,1,...,n\}$. We then provide sufficient
conditions for weakly continuous Markov chains under which general
truncation-augmentation schemes converge weakly in continuous state space.
Finally, we briefly discuss the extension of the theory to continuous time

acceleration mechanisms during reconnection have been extensively studied by
particle-in-cell simulations, yet it is an intriguing enigma as to how the
magnetic field energy is divided into thermally heated plasmas and nonthermal
particles. Here we study both non-relativistic and relativistic magnetic
reconnections using large-scale particle-in-cell simulation for a pair plasma,
and indicate that the production of the nonthermal particle becomes efficient
with increasing the plasma temperature. In the relativistic hot plasma case, we
determine that the heated plasmas by reconnection can be approximated by a
kappa distribution function with the kappa index of approximately 3 or less

propose a self-supervised learning framework for light field depth estimation.
Different from the existing end-to-end training methods using disparity label
per pixel, our approach implements network training by estimating EPI disparity
shift after refocusing, which extends the disparity range of epipolar lines. To
reduce the sensitivity of EPI to noise, we propose a new input mode called
EPI-Stack, which stacks EPIs in the view dimension. This method is less
sensitive to noise scenes than traditional input mode and improves the
efficiency of estimation. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed method can also obtain higher quality results in real-world scenarios,

labeled bags (i.e., untrimmed videos). However, this formulation typically
treats snippets in a video as independent instances, ignoring the underlying
temporal structures within and across action segments. To address this problem,
we propose \system, a novel WTAL framework that enables explicit, action-aware

segment-centric components: (i) dynamic segment sampling for compensating the
contribution of short actions; (ii) intra- and inter-segment attention for
modeling action dynamics and capturing temporal dependencies; (iii) pseudo
instance-level supervision for improving action boundary prediction.
Furthermore, a multi-step refinement strategy is proposed to progressively

semantic attributes for 3D reconstruction task. Since the semantic attributes
of a single image are usually implicit and entangled with each other, it is
still challenging to reconstruct 3D shape with detailed semantic structures
represented by the input image. To address this problem, we propose 3DAttriFlow
to disentangle and extract semantic attributes through different semantic
levels in the input images. These disentangled semantic attributes will be
integrated into the 3D shape reconstruction process, which can provide definite
guidance to the reconstruction of specific attribute on 3D shape. As a result,
the 3D decoder can explicitly capture high-level semantic features at the
bottom of the network, and utilize low-level features at the top of the
network, which allows to reconstruct more accurate 3D shapes. Note that the
explicit disentangling is learned without extra labels, where the only

3DAttriFlow outperforms the state-of-the-art shape reconstruction methods, and

mechanism of large-scale networks (i.e. poor scalability, coarse granularity

and improving delay performance at the expense of sacrificing some resource
utilization), the paper puts forward the idea and thoery of particle access. In
the proposed particle access mechanism, the network first granulates the
information flow (that is, the information flow is subdivided into information
particles, each of which is given its corresponding attributes), and allocates
access resources to the information particle group which is composed of all the
information particles to be transmitted, so as to ensure that the occupied
bandwidth resources is minimized on the premise of meeting the delay
requirements of each information particle. Moreover, in the paper, the concepts
of both information particle and information particle group are defined; Basic
properties of the minimum reachable access bandwidth of an information particle
group are analyzed; The influences of time attribute and attribute of bearing
capacity of an information particle group on the minimum reachable access
bandwidth are analyzed; Finally, an effective method for the calculation of the
minimum reachable access bandwidth of an information particle group is given,
and a particle access algorithm based on dynamically adjusting the minimum
reachable access bandwidth is proposed. The research of the paper pave a new
way for further improving QoS mechanisms of large-scale networks, and lay the

facilitate the modeling of open-set noise distribution and enhance the

spaces is essential to Neural Architecture Search. One-Shot methods tackle this
challenge by training one supernet to approximate the performance of every
architecture in the search space via weight-sharing, thereby drastically
reducing the search cost. However, due to coupled optimization between child
architectures caused by weight-sharing, One-Shot supernet's performance
estimation could be inaccurate, leading to degraded search outcomes. To address
this issue, Few-Shot NAS reduces the level of weight-sharing by splitting the
One-Shot supernet into multiple separated sub-supernets via edge-wise
(layer-wise) exhaustive partitioning. Since each partition of the supernet is
not equally important, it necessitates the design of a more effective splitting
criterion. In this work, we propose a gradient matching score (GM) that
leverages gradient information at the shared weight for making informed
splitting decisions. Intuitively, gradients from different child models can be
used to identify whether they agree on how to update the shared modules, and
subsequently to decide if they should share the same weight. Compared with
exhaustive partitioning, the proposed criterion significantly reduces the
branching factor per edge. This allows us to split more edges (layers) for a
given budget, resulting in substantially improved performance as NAS search
spaces usually include dozens of edges (layers). Extensive empirical
evaluations of the proposed method on a wide range of search spaces

Euclidean crystallographic groups, offering a new platform for classical and
quantum waves, demonstrating great potentials for a new class of topological
metamaterials. One important feature of hyperbolic lattices is that their
translation group is nonabelian, permitting high-dimensional irreducible
representations (irreps), in contrast to abelian translation groups in
Euclidean lattices. Here we introduce a general framework to construct wave
eigenstates of high-dimensional irreps of infinite hyperbolic lattices, thereby
generalizing Bloch's theorem, and discuss its implications on unusual
mode-counting and degeneracy, as well as bulk-edge correspondence in hyperbolic
lattices. We apply this method to a mechanical hyperbolic lattice, and
characterize its band structure and zero modes of high-dimensional irreps.

  https://github.com/WanyuGroup/CVPR2022-OrphicX",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a new eXplanation framework, called OrphicX, for
generating causal explanations for any graph neural networks (GNNs) based on
learned latent causal factors. Specifically, we construct a distinct generative
model and design an objective function that encourages the generative model to
produce causal, compact, and faithful explanations. This is achieved by
isolating the causal factors in the latent space of graphs by maximizing the
information flow measurements. We theoretically analyze the cause-effect
relationships in the proposed causal graph, identify node attributes as
confounders between graphs and GNN predictions, and circumvent such confounder
effect by leveraging the backdoor adjustment formula. Our framework is
compatible with any GNNs, and it does not require access to the process by
which the target GNN produces its predictions. In addition, it does not rely on
the linear-independence assumption of the explained features, nor require prior
knowledge on the graph learning tasks. We show a proof-of-concept of OrphicX on
canonical classification problems on graph data. In particular, we analyze the
explanatory subgraphs obtained from explanations for molecular graphs (i.e.,
Mutag) and quantitatively evaluate the explanation performance with frequently
occurring subgraph patterns. Empirically, we show that OrphicX can effectively
identify the causal semantics for generating causal explanations, significantly
outperforming its alternatives.

associated with the host galaxy, cospatial with the Extended Emission Line
Region (EELR) observed in the optical. The millimeter spectral energy
distribution and comparison with centimeter data show that the extended
emission cannot be explained by dust thermal emission, synchrotron or thermal
bremsstrahlung arising from massive star formation. We interpret the extended
millimeter emission as thermal bremsstrahlung from gas directly ionized by the
central source. The extended flux indicates that at least $\sim 7\%$ of the
bolometric flux of the nuclear source was used to ionize atomic hydrogen in the
host galaxy. The ionized gas is estimated to be as massive as $10^{10}$ to

set a Boltzmann Machine (BM), which is an undirected graphical model that

Owing to difficulty calculating the BM's log-likelihood gradient, it is
necessary to approximate it by using the sample mean obtained from the BM,
which has tentative parameters. To calculate the sample mean, a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) is often used. In a previous study, this was performed using

adopted to disentangle the importances of different galaxy members. We confirm
that an additional satellite does improve the halo mass estimation compared to

that support ultra-low-loss, compact dielectric photonic crystals with
exceptional high-Q modes that operate at visible or telecom wavelengths. New
insights into modal engineering have recently emerged from researchers
exploring exotic electronic phases in 2D materials. The phenomenon relates to a
twist in the angle between two layers of materials with high periodic spatial
ordering, such as graphene. A moire pattern forms, and at a particular magic
angle of twist, the electronic behavior significantly changes, enjoying a flat
energy-momentum dispersion relationship. There is an optical analog to the
electron twistronics: bilayer moire photonic crystal slabs can realize a
flat-band condition. Under these conditions, the propagating modes have zero
group velocity, thus giving rise to momentum-free trapping of Bloch waves in
both transverse and vertical directions, creating high quality-factors and
exceptionally small modal volumes that eventually lead to the enhancement of
the Purcell effect. The dramatically different means of light-localization
afforded by moire-structured cavities, very small mode volumes, and spatial
determination by the overall moire pattern can manipulate spontaneous emission.
This provides many opportunities for applications such as low-threshold lasing,

problem in computer vision. This task is challenging due to fast motion and
pose occlusion that frequently occur in videos. State-of-the-art methods strive
to incorporate additional visual evidences from neighboring frames (supporting
frames) to facilitate the pose estimation of the current frame (key frame). One
aspect that has been obviated so far, is the fact that current methods directly
aggregate unaligned contexts across frames. The spatial-misalignment between
pose features of the current frame and neighboring frames might lead to
unsatisfactory results. More importantly, existing approaches build upon the
straightforward pose estimation loss, which unfortunately cannot constrain the
network to fully leverage useful information from neighboring frames. To tackle
these problems, we present a novel hierarchical alignment framework, which
leverages coarse-to-fine deformations to progressively update a neighboring
frame to align with the current frame at the feature level. We further propose
to explicitly supervise the knowledge extraction from neighboring frames,
guaranteeing that useful complementary cues are extracted. To achieve this
goal, we theoretically analyzed the mutual information between the frames and
arrived at a loss that maximizes the task-relevant mutual information. These
allow us to rank No.1 in the Multi-frame Person Pose Estimation Challenge on
benchmark dataset PoseTrack2017, and obtain state-of-the-art performance on

single-stage object detector. Finally, the proposed areas-of-interest are used
to filter out low confidence detections. Testing on a handheld subset of
Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) demonstrates that this 3 stage
process results in a 70 percent decrease in false positives while only reducing
true positives by 17 percent in its strongest configuration. We also present a

adversarial attacks on natural multi-object scenes is to impose a
context-consistency check, wherein, if the detected objects are not consistent
with an appropriately defined context, then an attack is suspected. Stronger
attacks are needed to fool such context-aware detectors. We present the first
approach for generating context-consistent adversarial attacks that can evade
the context-consistency check of black-box object detectors operating on
complex, natural scenes. Unlike many black-box attacks that perform repeated
attempts and open themselves to detection, we assume a ""zero-query"" setting,
where the attacker has no knowledge of the classification decisions of the
victim system. First, we derive multiple attack plans that assign incorrect
labels to victim objects in a context-consistent manner. Then we design and use
a novel data structure that we call the perturbation success probability
matrix, which enables us to filter the attack plans and choose the one most
likely to succeed. This final attack plan is implemented using a
perturbation-bounded adversarial attack algorithm. We compare our zero-query
attack against a few-query scheme that repeatedly checks if the victim system
is fooled. We also compare against state-of-the-art context-agnostic attacks.
Against a context-aware defense, the fooling rate of our zero-query approach is
significantly higher than context-agnostic approaches and higher than that
achievable with up to three rounds of the few-query scheme.

a modified weak measurement protocol with a temporal pointer, namely, the

small longitudinal time delay (tiny phase shift) $\tau$ of a Gaussian pulse is
measured by implementing two simultaneous auto-correlative weak measurements
under Gaussian white noise with different SNR. The small quantities $\tau$ are
obtained by measuring the auto-correlation coefficient of the pulses instead of
fitting the shift of the mean value of the probe in the standard WVA technique.
Simulation results show that the AWVA approach outperforms the standard WVA
technique in the time domain with smaller statistical errors, remarkably
increasing the precision of weak measurement under strong noise background.

Our goal is to automatically derive a polygonal modeling sequence for a given

sequence and also expedite the modeling process by starting from the
auto-generated result. As a starting point for building a system for 3D
modeling in the future, we tackle the 2D shape modeling problem and present

predict sequential topological actions and geometric actions. Our hybrid method
can alter topology, whereas the recently proposed inverse shape estimation
methods using differentiable rendering can only handle a fixed topology. Our
novel reward function encourages MCTS to select topological actions that lead

that knows the set of arm TPMs but not the exact mapping of the TPMs to the

to an upper bound on the error probability. The decision entity selects one arm

problem instance-dependent asymptotic lower bound on the growth rate of the
expected time required to find the index of the best arm, where the asymptotics
is as the error probability vanishes. Further, we propose a sequential policy
that, for an input parameter $R$, forcibly selects an arm that has not been

an upper bound that depends on $R$ and is monotonically non-increasing as

39 K stars at three distinct ages: 40 Myr, 650 Myr, and $\approx$5 Gyr. We find
that the K star (0.6 -- 0.8 M$_{\odot}$) UV flux remains constant beyond 650
Myr before falling off by an order of magnitude by field age. This is distinct
from early M stars (0.3 -- 0.6 M$_{\odot}$), which begin to decline after only
a few hundred Myr. However, the rotation-UV activity relation for K stars is
nearly identical to that of early M stars. These results may be a consequence
of the spin-down stalling effect recently reported for K dwarfs, in which the
spin-down of K stars halts for over a Gyr when their rotation periods reach
$\approx$10 d, rather than the continuous spin down that G stars experience.

wave packet or two-photon correlation function against the coupling power was
varied from about 70 to 580 ns. We derived an analytical expression of the
biphoton's spectral profile in the Doppler-broadened medium. The analytical
expression reveals that the spectral profile is mainly determined by the effect
of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), and behaves like a
Lorentzian function with a linewidth approximately equal to the EIT linewidth.
Consequently, the biphoton's temporal profile influenced by the Doppler
broadening is an exponential-decay function, which was consistent with the
experimental data. Employing a weak input probe field of classical light, we
further measured the EIT spectra under the same experimental conditions as
those in the biphoton measurements. The theoretical predictions of the biphoton
wave packets calculated with the parameters determined by the classical-light
EIT spectra are consistent with the experimental data. The consistency
demonstrates that in the Doppler-broadened medium, the classical-light EIT
spectrum is a good indicator for the biphoton's temporal profile. Besides, the
measured biphoton's temporal widths well approximated to the predictions of the

have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Current
adversarial defenders often learn to denoise the (attacked) point clouds by
reconstruction, and then feed them to the classifiers as input. In contrast to
the literature, we propose a family of robust structured declarative
classifiers for point cloud classification, where the internal constrained
optimization mechanism can effectively defend adversarial attacks through
implicit gradients. Such classifiers can be formulated using a bilevel
optimization framework. We further propose an effective and efficient
instantiation of our approach, namely, Lattice Point Classifier (LPC), based on
structured sparse coding in the permutohedral lattice and 2D convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) that is end-to-end trainable. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art robust point cloud classification performance on ModelNet40
and ScanNet under seven different attackers. For instance, we achieve 89.51%

outperforms DUP-Net and IF-Defense with PointNet by ~70%. Demo code is

monolayer (1L), bi-layer (2L), tri-layer (3L), four-to-six-layer (4-6L),

near-field of a nanometric needle tip. A probe field perturbs the photoemission
from the tip, which is induced by a pump pulse, generating a field-dependent
current modulation that can easily be captured with our electronic detection
scheme. The approach provides reliable characterization of near-petahertz
fields. We show that not only the spiral wave-front of visible femtosecond
light pulses carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) can be resolved, but also
the field evolution with time in the focal plane. Additionally, our method is
polarization sensitive, which makes it applicable to vectorial field
reconstruction.

relying on the impurity based feature importance of the RF algorithm, we
directly use the out-of-bag (OOB) scores to evaluate the importances of
individual features and different feature combinations. Among all the features
studied, we find the virial ratio, $\eta$, to be the most important single
feature. The features calculated directly from the simulations and in
3-dimensions carry more information on the DS than those constructed from the
mock maps. Compared with the features based on X-ray or SZ maps, features
related to the centroid positions are more important. Despite the large number
of investigated features, a combination of up to three features of different
types can already saturate the score of the prediction. Lastly, we show that
the most sensitive feature $\eta$ is strongly correlated with the well-known
half-mass bias in dynamical modelling. Without a selection in DS, cluster halos
have an asymmetric distribution in $\eta$, corresponding to an overall positive
half-mass bias. Our work provides a quantitative reference for selecting the
best features to discriminate the DS of galaxy clusters in both simulations and

for unsupervised learning resulting in a coarse identification of the
environment and a separate local navigation policy for local identification and
navigation. The former learns and predicts the scene based on the short term
image sequences seen by the robot along with the transition image scenarios
using long term image sequences. The latter uses sparse image matching to
characterise the similarity of frames achieved vis-a-vis the frames viewed by
the robot during the mapping and training stage. A sparse graph of the image
sequence is created which is then used to carry out robust navigation purely on
the basis of visual goals. The proposed approach is evaluated on two robots in
a test environment and demonstrates the ability to navigate in dynamic
environments where landmarks are obscured and classical localization methods

convolutional neural network (MSKACNN). Using raw bearing vibration signals as
the inputs, MSKACNN provides vibration feature learning and signal
classification capabilities to identify and analyze bearing faults. Ball mixing
is a ball bearing production quality problem that is difficult to identify
using traditional frequency domain analysis methods since it requires high
frequency resolutions of the measurement signals and results in a long
analyzing time. The proposed MSKACNN is shown to improve the efficiency and
accuracy of ball mixing diagnosis. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of
MSKACNN in bearing fault identification, a bearing vibration data acquisition
system was developed, and vibration signal acquisition was performed on rolling
bearings under five different fault conditions including ball mixing. The
resulting datasets were used to analyze the performance of our proposed model.
To validate the adaptive ability of MSKACNN, fault test data from the Case
Western Reserve University Bearing Data Center were also used. Test results
show that MSKACNN can identify the different bearing conditions with high
accuracy with high generalization ability. We presented an implementation of
the MSKACNN as a lightweight module for a real-time bearing fault diagnosis

evaluated based on subjective naturalness and have not objectively examined
whether they can reproduce pitch patterns of phonological phenomena such as
downstep, rhythmic boost, and initial lowering that reflect syntactic

phonological constraints and the syntax$\unicode{x2013}$prosody mapping
hypothesis (SPMH), which assumes projections from syntactic structures to
phonological hierarchy. Although some experiments in psycholinguistics have
verified the validity of the SPMH, it is crucial to investigate whether it can
be implemented in TTS. To synthesize linguistic phenomena involving syntactic
or phonological constraints, we propose a model using phonological symbols
based on the SPMH and prosodic well-formedness constraints. Experimental
results showed that the proposed method synthesized similar pitch patterns to
those reported in linguistics experiments for the phenomena of initial lowering

against adversarial attacks particularly within the image processing domain.
Speech processing applications such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) are
increasingly relying on deep learning models, and so are also prone to
adversarial attacks. However, many of the defenses explored for ASR simply
adapt the image-domain defenses, which may not provide optimal robustness. This
paper explores speech specific defenses using the mel spectral domain, and
introduces a novel defense method called 'mel domain noise flooding' (MDNF).
MDNF applies additive noise to the mel spectrogram of a speech utterance prior
to re-synthesising the audio signal. We test the defenses against strong
white-box adversarial attacks such as projected gradient descent (PGD) and
Carlini-Wagner (CW) attacks, and show better robustness compared to a
randomized smoothing baseline across strong threat models.

develop three networks: detection network with mirror attention (D-Net) and
comparative ranking and matching networks (R-Net and M-Net). D-Net extracts
semantic lines by exploiting rich contextual information. To this end, we
design the mirror attention module. Then, through pairwise comparisons of
extracted semantic lines, we iteratively select the most semantic line and
remove redundant ones overlapping with the selected one. For the pairwise
comparisons, we develop R-Net and M-Net in the Siamese architecture.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
conventional semantic line detector significantly. Moreover, we apply the
proposed algorithm to detect two important kinds of semantic lines
successfully: dominant parallel lines and reflection symmetry axes. Our codes

(QUBO) problem, which is solved by DA. In particular, we implement the proposed
DA decoder for the surface code and perform detailed numerical experiments for
various code distances to see its performance and scalability. We observe that
computational scaling for the DA decoder has a lower order of polynomial than
the decoding methods using simulated annealing (SA) and minimum-weight perfect
matching (MWPM) algorithm under all tested conditions. It is also shown that
the DA decoder has advantages over the Union-Find (UF) decoder from a variety
of perspectives including hardware implementation. Furthermore, the threshold
behavior of the logical error probability for the DA decoder is analyzed and
the resultant threshold lies between 9.4% and 9.8%, which is very close to that
obtained by the MWPM decoder. This result clearly shows the high potential of
the DA decoder for quantum error correction.

alternative suboptimal feasible solutions can be obtained more economically. By
using the barrier-based interior point method, the constrained CBF-QP problems
are converted into the unconstrained ones with suboptimal solutions tracked by
two continuous descent-based algorithms. Considering the lag effect of tracking
and exploiting the system information, the prediction method is added to the
algorithms which thereby achieves a exponential convergence rate to the
time-varying suboptimal solutions. The convergence and robustness of the

theoretically. In the end, the effectiveness is illustrated by simulations on

negligible in many cases, and that the results of variable selection differ

semantics based on the training of data with seen semantics. Recent studies
either leverage the global image features or mine discriminative local patch
features to associate the extracted visual features to the semantic attributes.
However, due to the lack of the necessary top-down guidance and semantic
alignment for ensuring the model attending to the real attribute-correlation
regions, these methods still encounter a significant semantic gap between the
visual modality and the attribute modality, which makes their prediction on
unseen semantics unreliable. To solve this problem, this paper establishes a
novel transformer encoder-decoder model, called hybrid routing transformer
(HRT). In HRT encoder, we embed an active attention, which is constructed by
both the bottom-up and the top-down dynamic routing pathways to generate the
attribute-aligned visual feature. While in HRT decoder, we use static routing
to calculate the correlation among the attribute-aligned visual features, the
corresponding attribute semantics, and the class attribute vectors to generate
the final class label predictions. This design makes the presented transformer
model a hybrid of 1) top-down and bottom-up attention pathways and 2) dynamic
and static routing pathways. Comprehensive experiments on three widely-used
benchmark datasets, namely CUB, SUN, and AWA2, are conducted. The obtained
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Segmentation (VOS) which learns visual correspondence (i.e., the similarity
between pixel-level features) from unlabeled videos. Previous methods are
mainly based on the contrastive learning paradigm, which optimize either in
image level or pixel level. Image-level optimization (e.g., the spatially
pooled feature of ResNet) learns robust high-level semantics but is sub-optimal
since the pixel-level features are optimized implicitly. By contrast,
pixel-level optimization is more explicit, however, it is sensitive to the
visual quality of training data and is not robust to object deformation. To
complementarily perform these two levels of optimization in a unified
framework, we propose the In-aNd-Out (INO) generative learning from a purely
generative perspective with the help of naturally designed class tokens and
patch tokens in Vision Transformer (ViT). Specifically, for image-level
optimization, we force the out-view imagination from local to global views on
class tokens, which helps capture high-level semantics, and we name it as
out-generative learning. As to pixel-level optimization, we perform in-view
masked image modeling on patch tokens, which recovers the corrupted parts of an
image via inferring its fine-grained structure, and we term it as in-generative
learning. To discover the temporal information better, we additionally force
the inter-frame consistency from both feature and affinity matrix levels.
Extensive experiments on DAVIS-2017 val and YouTube-VOS 2018 val show that our
INO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. Code

evaluates five CO-APUFs including three influential designs of FF-APUF,
XOR-FF-APUF, iPUF, one very recently design and our newly optimized design
(dubbed as OAX-FF-APUF), in terms of their reliability, uniformity (related to

are employed to examine these CO-APUFs' modeling resilience -- the first two

show that all five CO-APUFs with relatively large scale can be successfully
modeled -- attacking accuracy higher or close to its reliability. The
hyper-parameter tuning of DL technique is crucial for implementing efficient
attacks. Increasing the scale of the CO-APUF is validated to be able to improve
the resilience but should be done with minimizing the reliability degradation.
As the powerful capability of DL technique affirmed by us, we recommend the DL,
specifically the MLP technique always demonstrating best efficacy, to be always
considered for examining the modeling resilience when newly composited APUFs

than one class at the same time. We propose an evolving multi-label fuzzy
classifier (EFC-ML) which is able to self-adapt and self-evolve its structure
with new incoming multi-label samples in an incremental, single-pass manner. It
is based on a multi-output Takagi-Sugeno type architecture, where for each
class a separate consequent hyper-plane is defined. The learning procedure
embeds a locally weighted incremental correlation-based algorithm combined with
(conventional) recursive fuzzily weighted least squares and Lasso-based
regularization. The correlation-based part ensures that the interrelations
between class labels, a specific well-known property in multi-label
classification for improved performance, are preserved properly; the
Lasso-based regularization reduces the curse of dimensionality effects in the
case of a higher number of inputs. Antecedent learning is achieved by
product-space clustering and conducted for all class labels together, which
yields a single rule base, allowing a compact knowledge view. Furthermore, our
approach comes with an online active learning (AL) strategy for updating the
classifier on just a number of selected samples, which in turn makes the
approach applicable for scarcely labelled streams in applications, where the
annotation effort is typically expensive. Our approach was evaluated on several
data sets from the MULAN repository and showed significantly improved
classification accuracy compared to (evolving) one-versus-rest or classifier
chaining concepts. A significant result was that, due to the online AL method,
a 90\% reduction in the number of samples used for classifier updates had
little effect on the accumulated accuracy trend lines compared to a full update

another dominated modality in some scenarios, e.g., sound in blowing wind

imbalance, we propose on-the-fly gradient modulation to adaptively control the
optimization of each modality, via monitoring the discrepancy of their
contribution towards the learning objective. Further, an extra Gaussian noise
that changes dynamically is introduced to avoid possible generalization drop
caused by gradient modulation. As a result, we achieve considerable improvement

the adjustable-phase-shifters considered in most existing hybrid beamforming
studies are power-hungry and difficult to realize in the THz band. Moreover,
due to the ultra-massive antennas, full channel-state-information (CSI) is

promising results in medium- to heavy-mass nuclei. A particular challenge for
many of the many-body methodologies, however, is an accurate treatment of the
electric-quadrupole, $E2$, strength associated with collectivity. Purpose: The
valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) is a
particularly powerful method for accessing medium- and high-mass nuclei but has
been found to underpredict $E2$ strengths. The purpose of this work is to
evaluate the isospin dependence of this underprediction. Methods: We perform a
systematic comparison of valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization
group (VS-IMSRG) calculations with available literature. We make use of
isoscalar and isovector contributions to the $E2$ matrix elements to assess
isoscalar and isovector contributions to the missing strength. Results: It is
found that the $E2$ strength is consistent throughout
$T_z=\left|\frac{1}{2}\right|$, $T_z=\left|1\right|$,
$T_z=\left|\frac{3}{2}\right|$ and $T_z=2$ pairs within the $sd$-shell.
Furthermore, no isovector contribution to the deficiency is identified.
Conclusions: A comparison with toy-models and coupled-cluster calculations is

missing many-particle, many-hole excitations out of the model space. The
absence of any significant isovector contribution to the missing $E2$ strength
indicates that the $E2$ strength discrepancy, and therefore any correction, is
largely independent of the isospin of the nuclei in question.

performance degradation in some particular scenarios with data distribution
gap. To alleviate this problem of domain shift, conventional wisdom typically
concentrates solely on reducing the discrepancy between the source and target
domains via attached domain classifiers, yet ignoring the difficulty of such
transferable features in coping with both classification and localization
subtasks in object detection. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose
Task-specific Inconsistency Alignment (TIA), by developing a new alignment
mechanism in separate task spaces, improving the performance of the detector on
both subtasks. Specifically, we add a set of auxiliary predictors for both
classification and localization branches, and exploit their behavioral
inconsistencies as finer-grained domain-specific measures. Then, we devise
task-specific losses to align such cross-domain disagreement of both subtasks.
By optimizing them individually, we are able to well approximate the category-
and boundary-wise discrepancies in each task space, and therefore narrow them
in a decoupled manner. TIA demonstrates superior results on various scenarios
to the previous state-of-the-art methods. It is also observed that both the
classification and localization capabilities of the detector are sufficiently
strengthened, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our TIA method. Code

Faster R-CNN needs a pre-training on an additional dataset, which divides the

this paper, we build a pure Transformer-based model, which integrates image

SwinTransformer to replace Faster R-CNN as the backbone encoder to extract
grid-level features from given images; Then, referring to Transformer, we build
a refining encoder and a decoder. The refining encoder refines the grid
features by capturing the intra-relationship between them, and the decoder
decodes the refined features into captions word by word. Furthermore, in order
to increase the interaction between multi-modal (vision and language) features
to enhance the modeling capability, we calculate the mean pooling of grid
features as the global feature, then introduce it into refining encoder to
refine with grid features together, and add a pre-fusion process of refined
global feature and generated words in decoder. To validate the effectiveness of

consistent semantics or object boundaries, and can act as strong cues to guide
the learning of 2D image representations without semantic labels. Specifically,
we introduce 3D geometric consistency into a contrastive learning framework to
enforce the feature consistency within image views. We propose to use geometric
consistency sets as constraints and adapt the InfoNCE loss accordingly. We show
that our learned image representations are general. By fine-tuning our
pre-trained representations for various 2D image-based downstream tasks,
including semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on
real-world indoor scene datasets, we achieve superior performance compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

  Detection via Everyday Indoor Robot Navigation","7 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of image change detection via everyday indoor robot navigation is
explored from a novel perspective of the self-attention technique. Detecting
semantically non-distinctive and visually small changes remains a key challenge
in the robotics community. Intuitively, these small non-distinctive changes may
be better handled by the recent paradigm of the attention mechanism, which is
the basic idea of this work. However, existing self-attention models require
significant retraining cost per domain, so it is not directly applicable to
robotics applications. We propose a new self-attention technique with an
ability of unsupervised on-the-fly domain adaptation, which introduces an
attention mask into the intermediate layer of an image change detection model,
without modifying the input and output layers of the model. Experiments, in
which an indoor robot aims to detect visually small changes in everyday
navigation, demonstrate that our attention technique significantly boosts the
state-of-the-art image change detection model.

A skyrmion string is formed in a frustrated layered system, which is well
described by the $XY$ model owing to the exchange coupling between adjacent
layers. We consider a system where the interlayer exchange couplings are
alternating, where the dimerized $XY$ model is materialized, whose linear limit
is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We argue that it is a nonlinear topological
system. We study the quench dynamics of the helicity wave under the initial
condition that the helicity of the skyrmion in the bottommost layer is rotated.
It yields a good signal to detect whether the system is topological or trivial.
Our results show that the helicity dynamics of the skyrmion string have a rich

practice to cope with self-supervised representation learning. A seminal work,
BEiT, casts MIM as a classification task with a visual vocabulary, tokenizing
the continuous visual signals into discrete vision tokens using a pre-learned
dVAE. Despite a feasible solution, the improper discretization hinders further
improvements of image pre-training. Since image discretization has no
ground-truth answers, we believe that the masked patch should not be assigned
with a unique token id even if a better tokenizer can be obtained. In this
work, we introduce an improved BERT-style image pre-training method, namely
mc-BEiT, which performs MIM proxy tasks towards eased and refined multi-choice
training objectives. Specifically, the multi-choice supervision for the masked
image patches is formed by the soft probability vectors of the discrete token
ids, which are predicted by the off-the-shelf image tokenizer and further
refined by high-level inter-patch perceptions resorting to the observation that
similar patches should share their choices. Extensive experiments on
classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate the superiority
of our method, e.g., the pre-trained ViT-B achieves 84.1% top-1 fine-tuning
accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, 49.2% AP^b and 44.0% AP^m of object
detection and instance segmentation on COCO, 50.8% mIOU on ADE20K semantic

Onsager's variational principle (OVP). Our interests lie in the applications of
these variational methods to active matter physics. In our former work [Soft
Matter, 2021, 17, 3634], we have explored the applications of OVP-based
variational methods for the modeling of active matter dynamics. In the present

static problems in active elastic solids. We show that MFEVP can be used not
only to derive equilibrium equations, but also to develop approximate solution
methods, such as Ritz method, for active solid statics. Moreover, the power of
Ritz-type method can be further enhanced using deep learning methods if we use
deep neural networks to construct the trial solutions of the variational
problems. We then apply these variational methods and the deep Ritz method to
study the spontaneous bending and contraction of a thin active circular plate
that is induced by internal asymmetric active contraction. The circular plate
is found to be bent towards its contracting side. The study of such a simple
toy system gives implications for understanding the morphogenesis of solid-like
confluent cell monolayers. In addition, we introduce a so-called activogravity
length to characterize the importance of gravitational forces relative to
internal active contraction in driving the bending of the active plate. When
the lateral plate dimension is larger than the activogravity length (about 100

  Classification","CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Most methods tackle zero-shot video classification by aligning
visual-semantic representations within seen classes, which limits
generalization to unseen classes. To enhance model generalizability, this paper
presents an end-to-end framework that preserves alignment and uniformity
properties for representations on both seen and unseen classes. Specifically,
we formulate a supervised contrastive loss to simultaneously align
visual-semantic features (i.e., alignment) and encourage the learned features
to distribute uniformly (i.e., uniformity). Unlike existing methods that only
consider the alignment, we propose uniformity to preserve maximal-info of
existing features, which improves the probability that unobserved features fall
around observed data. Further, we synthesize features of unseen classes by
proposing a class generator that interpolates and extrapolates the features of
seen classes. Besides, we introduce two metrics, closeness and dispersion, to
quantify the two properties and serve as new measurements of model
generalizability. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
SoTA by relative improvements of 28.1% on UCF101 and 27.0% on HMDB51. Code is

by first-principles calculations. Defect formation energy analysis suggested
that it has limited chemical potential conditions for attaining Li-excess
conditions through doping (substituting tetravalent elements for Ta). The
formation of other native defects, such as Li vacancies, hinders the
stabilization of the dopant and compensates for the interstitial Li. When the
doping is successful, the interactions between the coexisting dopant and
interstitial Li can increase the migration energy barrier of the interstitial
Li. This phenomenon limits the factors responsible for achieving high Li-ion
conductivity in this material. Based on the results of the investigations on
KLi6TaO6, isostructural materials of the form ALi6XO6, with various

of high stability and low Li-ion migration energy. Twelve structures of the

state variables of a linear time-varying SISO dynamic system. It is assumed
that the control signal and the output variable are measurable. It is assumed
that the state matrix of the plant contains known variables and unknown
constant parameters, and the control matrix (vector) is unknown. The synthesis
of the observer is based on the GPEBO method (generalized parameter based
observer) proposed in $[1]$. Synthesis of adaptive provides for preliminary
parametrization of the initial system and its transformation to a linear
regression model with further identification of unknown parameters. To identify
unknown constant parameters a classical estimation algorithm was used (the
least squares method with a forgetting factor). This approach has proven itself
well in cases where the known regressor is frequency poor (that is, the
spectral composition of the regressor contains less than $r/2$ harmonics, where
r is the number of unknown parameters) or does not satisfy the so-called
undamped excitation condition. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed
method an example is presented in the article. A time-varying second-order
object with four unknown parameters was considered. Parameterization of the
initial dynamic model was performed and a linear static regression containing
six unknowns parameters was obtained (including the vector of unknown initial
conditions of system state variables). An adaptive observer was synthesized and
the results of computer modeling illustrating the achievement of a given goal
were presented. The main difference from the results published earlier in $[2]$
is the new assumption that the linear a time-varing system contains not only
unknown parameters in the state matrix, but also the matrix (vector) for
control contains unknown constant coefficients.

data both in time and space from a limited set of noisy measurements without
having any high-resolution reference data. Our objective is to obtain a
continuous solution of the problem, providing a physically-consistent
prediction at any point in the solution domain. We demonstrate the
applicability of PINNs for the super-resolution of flow-field data in time and

shedding behind a circular cylinder and the minimal turbulent channel flow. The
robustness of the models is also investigated by adding synthetic Gaussian

atmosphere is restricted due to the lack of requisite measurements. NO is an
abundant form of odd nitrogen species in the Martian lower atmosphere and its
density depends on several photochemical processes. We have developed a
photochemical model to study the NO density in the dayside of Martian upper
atmosphere by accounting for various production and loss mechanisms. By
utilizing the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) on-board Mars
Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission measured neutral and ion
densities during deep dip 8 and 9 campaigns, we modelled NO number density in
the Martian sunlit upper atmosphere for the altitudes between 120 and 200 km.
The modelled NO densities are employed to calculate NO (1,0) gamma band
emission intensity profiles in the dayside upper atmosphere of Mars. The
calculated NO density and its gamma band intensity profiles are found to be
consistent with Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) onboard MAVEN
observations and also with other modelling studies. We found that the local CO2
and N2 density variations can lead to a change in NO density and consequently
its dayglow intensity by a factor of 2 to 5. Since NO is a trace constituent
and also its dayglow emissions are strongly obscured by CO Cameron band
emissions, we suggest that the derivation of NO number density based on our
approach can constrain its abundance in the dayside upper atmosphere of Mars.
More observations of (1-0) gamma band emission along with modelling will help
to study the global distribution of NO in the Martian atmosphere.

attempting to detect individual phone- and word-level errors, we propose to
extract a subject-level representation from a long utterance that is
constructed by concatenating multiple test words. The speaker verification
approach, and posterior features generated by deep neural network models, are
applied to derive various types of holistic representations. A linear
classifier is trained to differentiate disordered speech in normal one. On the
task of detecting SSD in Cantonese-speaking children, experimental results show
that the proposed approach achieves improved detection performance over

problem of detecting a novel class of data that has not been previously
observed. A common setting for novelty detection is inductive whereby only
examples of the negative class are available during training time. Transductive
novelty detection on the other hand has only witnessed a recent surge in
interest, it not only makes use of the negative class during training but also
incorporates the (unlabeled) test set to detect novel examples. Several studies
have emerged under the transductive setting umbrella that have demonstrated its
advantage over its inductive counterpart. Depending on the assumptions about
the data, these methods go by different names (e.g. transductive novelty
detection, semi-supervised novelty detection, positive-unlabeled learning,
out-of-distribution detection). With the use of generative adversarial networks
(GAN), a segment of those studies have adopted a transductive setup in order to
learn how to generate examples of the novel class. In this study, we propose
TransductGAN, a transductive generative adversarial network that attempts to
learn how to generate image examples from both the novel and negative classes
by using a mixture of two Gaussians in the latent space. It achieves that by
incorporating an adversarial autoencoder with a GAN network, the ability to
generate examples of novel data points offers not only a visual representation

series known as the Born expansion. Each term of the Born expansion corresponds
to a scattering order, it is thus theoretically possible to discriminate single
and multiple scattering field components. Experimentally, what is actually
measured is the total field in which all scattering orders interfere.
Conventional imaging methods usually rely on the assumption that the multiple
scattering contribution can be disregarded. In a back-scattering configuration,
this assumption is valid for small depths, and begins to fail for depths larger
than the scattering mean-free path $\ell_s$. It is therefore a key issue to
estimate the relative amount of single and multiple scattering in experimental
data. To this end, a single scattering estimator $\hat{\rho}$ computed from the
reflection matrix has been introduced in order to assess the weight of single
scattering in the backscattered wavefield. In this article, the meaning of this
estimator is investigated and a particular attention is given to recurrent
scattering. In a diffraction-limited experiment, a multiple scattering sequence
is said to be recurrent if the first and last scattering events occur in the
same resolution cell. Recurrent scattering is shown to be responsible for
correlations between single scattering and higher scattering orders of the Born
expansion, inducing a bias to the estimator $\hat{\rho}$ that should rather be
termed confocal scattering ratio. Interestingly, a more robust estimator is
built by projecting the reflection matrix in a focused basis. The argument is
sustained by numerical simulations as well as ultrasonic data obtained around
1.5~MHz in a model medium made of nylon rods immersed in water. From a more
general perspective, this work raises fundamental questions about the impact of
recurrent scattering on wave imaging.

synthesis and assembly techniques need to meet stringent requirements in terms

small-angle twisted bilayer graphene assembled from separated CVD-grown
graphene single-crystals can ensure high-quality transport properties,
determined by a device-scale-uniform moire\'e potential. Via low-temperature
dual-gated magnetotransport, we demonstrate the hallmarks of a $2.4^\circ$

reduced Fermi velocity, large interlayer capacitance, and density-independent
Brown-Zak oscillations. The observation of these moir\'e-induced electrical
transport features establishes CVD-based twisted bilayer graphene as an
alternative to 'tear-and-stack' exfoliated flakes for fundamental studies,
while serving as a proof-of-concept for future large-scale assembly.

languages. For example, plural markers may only be relevant for human nouns.
English does not appear to make such distinctions. Using distributional
semantics, we show that English nominal pluralization exhibits semantic
clusters. For instance, pluralization of fruit words is more similar to one
another and less similar to pluralization of other semantic classes. Therefore,
reduction of the meaning shift in plural formation to the addition of an
abstract plural meaning is too simplistic. A semantically informed method,
called CosClassAvg, is introduced that outperforms pluralization methods in
distributional semantics which assume plural formation amounts to the addition
of a fixed plural vector. In comparison with our approach, a method from
compositional distributional semantics, called FRACSS, predicted plural vectors
that were more similar to the corpus-extracted plural vectors in terms of
direction but not vector length. A modeling study reveals that the observed
difference between the two predicted semantic spaces by CosClassAvg and FRACSS
carries over to how well a computational model of the listener can understand
previously unencountered plural forms. Mappings from word forms, represented
with triphone vectors, to predicted semantic vectors are more productive when
CosClassAvg-generated semantic vectors are employed as gold standard vectors
instead of FRACSS-generated vectors.

by first estimating the motion between inputs and then warping the inputs to
the target time with the estimated motion. This approach, however, is not
optimal when the temporal distance between the input sequence increases as
existing motion estimation modules cannot effectively handle large motions.
Hence, VFI works perform well for small frame gaps and perform poorly as the
frame gap increases. In this work, we propose a novel framework to address this
problem. We argue that when there is a large gap between inputs, instead of
estimating imprecise motion that will eventually lead to inaccurate
interpolation, we can safely propagate from one side of the input up to a
reliable time frame using the other input as a reference. Then, the rest of the
intermediate frames can be interpolated using standard approaches as the
temporal gap is now narrowed. To this end, we propose a propagation network
(PNet) by extending the classic feature-level forecasting with a novel
motion-to-feature approach. To be thorough, we adopt a simple interpolation
model along with PNet as our full model and design a simple procedure to train
the full model in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on several
benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method for long-term VFI

various frameworks of the equilibrium and dynamic DFTs, the liquid state

longitudinally polarized light, which in the high frequency limit can be used
to selectively modify interlayer hoppings in a tight-binding model. We argue
based on quasi-degenerate perturbation theory that changes to the interlayer
hoppings can be captured as a modulation to the strength of the moir\'e
potential in a continuum model. As a consequence, waveguide light can be used
to drive transitions between a myriad of different magnetic phases, including a
transition from a $120^\circ$ Neel phase to a stripe ordered magnetic phase, or
from a spin density wave phase to a paramagnetic phase, among others. When the
system is subjected to circularly polarized light we find that the effective
mass of the active TMD layer is modified by an applied electromagnetic field.
By simultaneously applying waveguide light and circularly polarized light to a

that the accuracy of the impact parameter prediction depends on the centrality

prediction accuracy is considerable low for central collisions. Our method
increases this accuracy by multiple folds. We also show that the eccentricity

URLLC services with relaxed latency requirements, allowing multiple

  Networks for End-to-End Visual Grounding",,,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual grounding focuses on establishing fine-grained alignment between
vision and natural language, which has essential applications in multimodal
reasoning systems. Existing methods use pre-trained query-agnostic visual
backbones to extract visual feature maps independently without considering the
query information. We argue that the visual features extracted from the visual
backbones and the features really needed for multimodal reasoning are
inconsistent. One reason is that there are differences between pre-training
tasks and visual grounding. Moreover, since the backbones are query-agnostic,
it is difficult to completely avoid the inconsistency issue by training the
visual backbone end-to-end in the visual grounding framework. In this paper, we
propose a Query-modulated Refinement Network (QRNet) to address the
inconsistent issue by adjusting intermediate features in the visual backbone
with a novel Query-aware Dynamic Attention (QD-ATT) mechanism and query-aware
multiscale fusion. The QD-ATT can dynamically compute query-dependent visual
attention at the spatial and channel levels of the feature maps produced by the
visual backbone. We apply the QRNet to an end-to-end visual grounding
framework. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on five widely used datasets.

simultaneously acquired by appropriately synchronizing a thermal and a standard

show that $\mathcal{G}^\delta$ is minimal of unbounded clique-width (and,
indeed, minimal of unbounded linear clique-width) if another parameter

innovative method based on Radial Basis Functions (RBF) mesh morphing is
proposed, allowing the retention of the same mesh topology suitable for a

cosmic structures in modern cosmology, and yet their exact physical models
remain largely uncertain. The Weyl scaling invariant theory of gravity may
provide a feasible scheme to solve these two puzzles jointly, which contains a
massive gauge boson playing the role of dark matter candidate, and allows the
quadratic scalar curvature term, namely $R^2$, to realize a viable inflationary
mechanism in agreement with current observations. We ponder on the production
of dark matters in the Weyl $R^2$ model, including the contribution from the
non-perturbative production due to the quantum fluctuations from inflationary
vacuum and perturbative ones from scattering. We demonstrate that there are
generally three parameter ranges for viable dark matter production: (1) If the
reheating temperature is larger than $10^3~\mathrm{GeV}$, the Weyl gauge boson
as dark matter can be produced abundantly with mass larger than the inflation
scale $\sim 10^{13}~\mathrm{GeV}$. (2) Small mass region with
$3\times10^{-13}~\mathrm{GeV}$ for a higher reheating temperature. (3)
Annihilation channel becomes important in the case of higher reheating
temperature, which enables the Weyl gauge boson with mass up to
$4\times10^{16}~\mathrm{GeV}$ to be produced through freeze-in.

statistical studies have been thoroughly used to resolve these favourable

Nuclei (AGN), namely, the mass of the central supermassive black hole (MBH) of
the maser host galaxy. We study the correlation between maser luminosity (LH2O)

The regression line of the relation is also calculated for these sub-samples.
Unlike the results of previous works, dividing the maser sample into MMs and

and low significant LH2O - MBH correlation, while MMs show no correlation. The
positive correlation in KMs can be explained by the role of AGN therein, while
the diversity of MMs types, with some of which are not strongly related to AGN,
may explain the correlation missing. Surprisingly, the 28 disc maser sample,

$(L^1-L^\infty)$-interpolation spaces. More precisely, we show that the
elliptic type operators involved in these equations generate holomorphic
semigroups. Then, we give explicit integral expressions for the associated

Such a connection extends some known results in the topic to a wider family of
both operators and the functions involved.

are to train a machine by feeding a large number of music pieces and create
artificial neural networks that can produce music similar to the input music
data. This approach is a blackbox optimization, that is, the underlying
composition algorithm is, in general, not known to users.
  In this paper, we present a way of machine composition that trains a machine
the composition principle embedded in the given music data instead of directly
feeding music pieces. We propose this approach by using the concept of
{\color{black}{Overlap}} matrix proposed in \cite{TPJ}. In \cite{TPJ}, a type
of Korean music, so-called the {\it Dodeuri} music such as Suyeonjangjigok has
been analyzed using topological data analysis (TDA), particularly using
persistent homology. As the raw music data is not suitable for TDA analysis,
the music data is first reconstructed as a graph. The node of the graph is
defined as a two-dimensional vector composed of the pitch and duration of each
music note. The edge between two nodes is created when those nodes appear
consecutively in the music flow. Distance is defined based on the frequency of
such appearances. Through TDA on the constructed graph, a unique set of cycles
is found for the given music. In \cite{TPJ}, the new concept of the {\it
{\color{black}{Overlap}} matrix} has been proposed, which visualizes how those
cycles are interconnected over the music flow, in a matrix form.
  In this paper, we explain how we use the {\color{black}{Overlap}} matrix for
machine composition. The {\color{black}{Overlap}} matrix makes it possible to
compose a new music piece algorithmically and also provide a seed music towards
the desired artificial neural network. In this paper, we use the {\it Dodeuri}
music and explain detailed steps.

safety, and the rise of data-driven techniques for modeling functions, we
propose a non-parametric approach for online synthesis of CBFs using Gaussian
Processes (GPs). Mathematical constructs such as CBFs have achieved safety by
designing a candidate function a priori. However, designing such a candidate
function can be challenging. A practical example of such a setting would be to
design a CBF in a disaster recovery scenario where safe and navigable regions
need to be determined. The decision boundary for safety in such an example is
unknown and cannot be designed a priori. In our approach, we work with safety
samples or observations to construct the CBF online by assuming a flexible GP
prior on these samples, and term our formulation as a Gaussian CBF. GPs have
favorable properties, in addition to being non-parametric, such as analytical
tractability and robust uncertainty estimation. This allows realizing the
posterior components with high safety guarantees by incorporating variance
estimation, while also computing associated partial derivatives in closed-form
to achieve safe control. Moreover, the synthesized safety function from our
approach allows changing the corresponding safe set arbitrarily based on the
data, thus allowing non-convex safe sets. We validate our approach
experimentally on a quadrotor by demonstrating safe control for fixed but
arbitrary safe sets and collision avoidance where the safe set is constructed
online. Finally, we juxtapose Gaussian CBFs with regular CBFs in the presence
of noisy states to highlight its flexibility and robustness to noise. The

and consequently affect the thermal, dielectric, and electronic properties of
solid state systems, greatly motivating the engineering of phononic structures.
Advances in nanofabrication have allowed for structuring and phonon confinement
even down to the nanoscale, drastically changing material properties. Despite
developments in fabricating such nanoscale devices, the proper manipulation and
characterization of phonons continues to be challenging. However, a fundamental

the perturbations from baryonic components of the Milky Way. Here we ran a
large number of test particle simulations to investigate the probability that
each of the known globular clusters (GCs) can form a GD-1-like gap, by using
the kinematical data of the GD-1 stream and GCs from Gaia EDR3 and by fully
taking into account the observational uncertainty. We found that the
probability that all of the three gaps were formed by GCs is as low as
$1.7\times10^{-5}$ and the expected number of gaps formed by GCs is only
$0.057$ in our fiducial model. Our result highly disfavors a scenario in which
GCs form the gaps. Given that other baryonic perturbers (e.g., giant molecular
clouds) are even less likely to form a gap in the retrograde-moving GD-1

the linguistic domain within the source language using lexical and grammatical
devices. This method enables us to translate the paraphrased text
representations instead of the transcription of the original speech and obtain
translations that preserve paralinguistic information. As a first step, we
present the collection of an English corpus containing speech that differed in
the placement of focus along with the corresponding text, which was designed to
reflect the implied meaning of the speech. Also, analyses of our corpus
demonstrated that mapping of focus from the paralinguistic domain into the
linguistic domain involved various lexical and grammatical methods. The data
and insights from our analysis will further advance research into
paralinguistic translation. The corpus will be published via LDC and our

quantum simulation. However, the standard way, Trotterization, requires a huge
numbers of gates to achieve desirable accuracy. Here, we propose a local
variational quantum compilation (LVQC) algorithm, which allows to accurately
and efficiently compile a time evolution operators on a large-scale quantum
system by the optimization with smaller-size quantum systems. LVQC utilizes a
subsystem cost function, which approximates the fidelity of the whole circuit,
defined for each subsystem as large as approximate causal cones brought by the
Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound. We rigorously derive its scaling property with
respect to the subsystem size, and show that the optimization conducted on the
subsystem size leads to the compilation of whole-system time evolution
operators. As a result, LVQC runs with limited-size quantum computers or
classical simulators that can handle such smaller quantum systems. For
instance, finite-ranged and short-ranged interacting $L$-size systems can be
compiled with $O(L^0)$- or $O(\log L)$-size quantum systems depending on
observables of interest. Furthermore, since this formalism relies only on the
LR bound, it can efficiently construct time evolution operators of various
systems in generic dimension involving finite-, short-, and long-ranged
interactions. We also numerically demonstrate the LVQC algorithm for
one-dimensional systems. Employing classical simulation by time-evolving block
decimation, we succeed in compressing the depth of a time evolution operators
up to $40$ qubits by the compilation for $20$ qubits. LVQC not only provides
classical protocols for designing large-scale quantum circuits, but also will
shed light on applications of intermediate-scale quantum devices in
implementing algorithms in larger-scale quantum devices.

probabilistic models, in this work we use a fixed ensemble of networks. Once
trained, our compact representation can be used to efficiently draw spatially
correlated samples from the approximated output distribution. Importantly, this
approach captures the uncertainty and structured correlations in the
predictions explicitly in a formal distribution, rather than implicitly through
sampling alone. This allows direct introspection of the model, enabling
visualisation of the learned structure. Moreover, this formulation provides two
further benefits: estimation of a sample probability, and the introduction of
arbitrary spatial conditioning at test time. We demonstrate the merits of our

large archival CO survey of radio galaxies (RGs) to determine their molecular
gas masses at different epochs. We used a sample of 120 RGs representative of
the NVSS 1.4 GHz survey, when flux limited at 0.4 Jy. Of those, 66 galaxies
belonged to the ALMA Radio-source Catalogue (ARC) of calibrators and had
spectral window tunings around CO (1-0), (2-1), (3-2), or (4-3). We reduced
their ALMA data, determined their H2 mass contents, and combined the results
with similar results for the remaining 54 galaxies from the literature. We
found that, while at all epochs the majority of RGs have undetectable
reservoirs, there is a rapid increase in the H2 mass content of the CO-detected
RGs with z. At 1<z<2.5, one-fourth of the RGs have at least as much molecular
gas as simulations would indicate for a typical halo mass of that epoch. These
galaxies plausibly have ``normal'' or even starburst hosts. Taking into account
the completeness correction of the sample, we created the corresponding H$_2$
mass functions at 0.005<z<0.3 and 1<z<2.5. The local mass function reveals that
the number density of low-z RGs with detectable molecular gas reservoirs is
only a little lower (a factor of ~4) than that of pure (or little star-forming)
type 1 and 2 AGN in simulations. At 1<z<2.5, there is a significant decrease in
the number density of high-z RGs due to the rarity of bright radio galaxies. An
estimate for the missing faint RGs would, nonetheless, bring populations close
again. Finally, we find that the volume density of molecular gas locked up in
the brightest 1/5000-1/7000 RGs is similar in the examined $z$ bins. This
result likely indicates that the inflow rate on one hand and the star-formation
depletion rate plus the jet-driven expulsion rate on the other hand counteract
each other in the most luminous RGs of each epoch.

increasingly prominent isolated data islands problem while keeping users' data
locally with privacy and security guarantees. However, FL could result in
task-oriented data traffic flows over wireless networks with limited radio
resources. To design communication-efficient FL, most of the existing studies
employ the first-order federated optimization approach that has a slow
convergence rate. This however results in excessive communication rounds for
local model updates between the edge devices and edge server. To address this
issue, in this paper, we instead propose a novel over-the-air second-order
federated optimization algorithm to simultaneously reduce the communication
rounds and enable low-latency global model aggregation. This is achieved by
exploiting the waveform superposition property of a multi-access channel to
implement the distributed second-order optimization algorithm over wireless
networks. The convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is further
characterized, which reveals a linear-quadratic convergence rate with an
accumulative error term in each iteration. We thus propose a system
optimization approach to minimize the accumulated error gap by joint device
selection and beamforming design. Numerical results demonstrate the system and
communication efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

In the first scenario, the two waves were separately associated with a filament
eruption and a precursor jet, while in another scenario the two waves were
successively associated with a filament eruption. Hence, we label these
distinguished scenarios as ""fraternal TEWs"" and ""identical TEWs"", respectively.
Further, we also suggest that impulsive lateral expansions of two distinct
groups of coronal loops are critical to the formation of TEWs in a single
eruption.

network on top of mel-filterbanks in a supervised fashion, has recently
benefited from two independent lines of work. The first one explores ""learnable
frontends"", i.e., neural modules that produce a learnable time-frequency
representation, to overcome limitations of fixed features. The second one uses
self-supervised learning to leverage unprecedented scales of pre-training data.
In this work, we study the feasibility of combining both approaches, i.e.,
pre-training learnable frontend jointly with the main architecture for
downstream classification. First, we show that pretraining two previously
proposed frontends (SincNet and LEAF) on Audioset drastically improves
linear-probe performance over fixed mel-filterbanks, suggesting that learnable
time-frequency representations can benefit self-supervised pre-training even
more than supervised training. Surprisingly, randomly initialized learnable
filterbanks outperform mel-scaled initialization in the self-supervised
setting, a counter-intuitive result that questions the appropriateness of
strong priors when designing learnable filters. Through exploratory analysis of
the learned frontend components, we uncover crucial differences in properties
of these frontends when used in a supervised and self-supervised setting,
especially the affinity of self-supervised filters to diverge significantly
from the mel-scale to model a broader range of frequencies.

or 2Ag) of polyenes and carotenoids. The theory assumes that in principle this
state is a linear combination of a singlet triplet-pair and an odd-parity
charge-transfer exciton. Crucially, these components only couple when the
triplet-pair occupies neighboring dimers, such that an electron transfer
between the triplets creates a nearest-neighbor charge-transfer excitation.
This local coupling stabilises the 2Ag state and induces a nearest neighbor
attraction between the triplets. In addition, because of the electron-hole
attraction in the exciton, the increased probability that the electron-hole
pair occupies neighboring dimers enhances the triplet-triplet attraction: the
triplet pair is `slaved' to the charge-transfer exciton. The theory also
predicts that as the Coulomb interaction is increased, the 2Ag state evolves
from a predominately odd-parity charge-transfer exciton state with a small
component of triplet-pair character to a state predominately composed of a
triplet-pair with some exciton character. Above a critical Coulomb interaction
there is a decoupling of the triplet-pair and charge-transfer exciton
subspaces, such that the 2Ag state becomes entirely composed of an unbound
spin-correlated triplet pair. The predictions of this theory are qualitatively
consistent with high-level density matrix renormalization group calculations of
the Pariser-Parr-Pople (or extended Hubbard) model.

have demonstrated coherent oscillations between logical states defined by
remote spins whose coupling is given by the superexchange interaction mediated
by central spins. Excavating the potential of superexchange requires a full
understanding of the interaction in terms of control parameters, which is still
lacking in literature. Here, using full configuration interaction calculation,
we study a linear triple-quantum-dot device in which the left and right dots
are occupied by a single electron each, whose spin states define the
computational basis states of a qubit. We have found that, when the detunings
at the left and right dots are leveled, the superexchange can exhibit a
non-monotonic behavior which ranges from positive to negative values as a
function of the middle-dot detuning. We further show that the larger relative
detuning between the left and right dots causes the magnitude of the
superexchange to increase (decrease) for an originally positive (negative)
superexchange. We then proceed to show that a much larger left-right dot
detuning can switch the superexchange from an originally negative value at zero
detuning to a positive one. Using a Hubbard-like model, we present analytical
expressions of the superexchange and have found that they conform well
qualitatively with the numerical results obtained from full configuration
interaction calculations. Our results suggest that even a simple configuration

  Information","accepted for publication at CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our goal is to recover the 3D shape and pose of dogs from a single image.
This is a challenging task because dogs exhibit a wide range of shapes and
appearances, and are highly articulated. Recent work has proposed to directly
regress the SMAL animal model, with additional limb scale parameters, from
images. Our method, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using
Classification), goes beyond prior work in several important ways. First, we
modify the SMAL shape space to be more appropriate for representing dog shape.
But, even with a better shape model, the problem of regressing dog shape from
an image is still challenging because we lack paired images with 3D ground
truth. To compensate for the lack of paired data, we formulate novel losses
that exploit information about dog breeds. In particular, we exploit the fact
that dogs of the same breed have similar body shapes. We formulate a novel
breed similarity loss consisting of two parts: One term encourages the shape of
dogs from the same breed to be more similar than dogs of different breeds. The
second one, a breed classification loss, helps to produce recognizable
breed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we find that our breed losses
significantly improve shape accuracy over a baseline without them. We also
compare BARC qualitatively to WLDO with a perceptual study and find that our
approach produces dogs that are significantly more realistic. This work shows
that a-priori information about genetic similarity can help to compensate for
the lack of 3D training data. This concept may be applicable to other animal

pool of candidates given a query in another modality. Solving such cross-modal
retrieval task is challenging because it not only requires learning robust
feature representations for both modalities, but also requires capturing the
fine-grained alignment between these two modalities. Existing cross-modal
retrieval models are mostly optimized by metric learning objectives as both of
them attempt to map data to an embedding space, where similar data are close
together and dissimilar data are far apart. Unlike other cross-modal retrieval
tasks such as image-text and video-text retrievals, audio-text retrieval is
still an unexplored task. In this work, we aim to study the impact of different
metric learning objectives on the audio-text retrieval task. We present an
extensive evaluation of popular metric learning objectives on the AudioCaps and
Clotho datasets. We demonstrate that NT-Xent loss adapted from self-supervised
learning shows stable performance across different datasets and training

  clay suspensions",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cohesive effects between fine-grained sediment particles greatly influence
their effective settling rate and erodibility. Many studies have observed a
qualitative difference in settling dynamics between clays in freshwater, where
particles remain dispersed, and in saltwater, where aggregates form and settle
rapidly. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of salt that separates
the two regimes however remains under-investigated, even though knowledge of
the CCC is crucial to understanding aggregation in settings such as estuaries,
where large salt concentration gradients occur. Furthermore, no simple
criterion exists to predict the CCC for clay suspensions. In this study,
systematic experiments are performed to determine the CCC, by measuring
transmitted light intensity through clay suspensions. To investigate the effect
of ion valence, sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl$_2$) are
used. For kaolin clay, the results show a CCC of 0.6mM NaCl ($\approx 0.04$ppt
NaCl $=$ 0.04 PSU), and of 0.04mM CaCl$_2$ ($\approx 0.004$ppt CaCl$_2$).
Because these salinities are lower than those commonly observed in nature,
these findings indicate that kaolin clay should flocculate in nearly all
natural aquatic environments. Furthermore, due to the fact that tap water often
has salinities higher than this threshold, these results imply that great care
is needed in experiments, especially in large facilities where using distilled
water is not feasible. In addition, a simple criterion to estimate the CCC for
a kaolin clay suspension is derived. This criterion predicts that flocculation
occurs at extremely low salt concentrations and is approximately independent of
clay concentration, in agreement with the experimental observations and
consistent with experimental evidence from the literature.

applications. In medical imaging for instance, intensity inhomogeneity and
noise are common. In thigh muscle images, different muscles are closed packed
together and there are often no clear boundaries between them. Intensity based
segmentation models cannot separate one muscle from another. To solve such
problems, in this work we present a segmentation model with adaptive spatial
priors from joint registration. This model combines segmentation and
registration in a unified framework to leverage their positive mutual
influence. The segmentation is based on a modified Gaussian mixture model
(GMM), which integrates intensity inhomogeneity and spacial smoothness. The
registration plays the role of providing a shape prior. We adopt a modified sum
of squared difference (SSD) fidelity term and Tikhonov regularity term for
registration, and also utilize Gaussian pyramid and parametric method for
robustness. The connection between segmentation and registration is guaranteed
by the cross entropy metric that aims to make the segmentation map (from
segmentation) and deformed atlas (from registration) as similar as possible.
This joint framework is implemented within a constraint optimization framework,
which leads to an efficient algorithm. We evaluate our proposed model on
synthetic and thigh muscle MR images. Numerical results show the improvement as

high annotation cost. We propose a novel IL framework to overcome this problem.
Assuming the availability of data from multiple domains for a higher level of
classification task, for which the labeling cost is low, we estimate an
invariant predictor for the target classification task with training data in a
single domain. Additionally, we propose two cross-validation methods for
selecting hyperparameters of invariance regularization to solve the issue of
hyperparameter selection, which has not been handled properly in existing IL
methods. The effectiveness of the proposed framework, including the

the sense that slightly more singular structures cannot generally be
propagated. For the 2D Euler equation, we prove that certain singular
structures are preserved by the motion, e.g. a system of $\log\log_+(1/|x|)$
vortices (and those that are slightly less singular) travel with the fluid in a
nonlinear fashion, up to bounded perturbations. We also give stability results
for weak Euler solutions away from their singular set.

  effects in progressive diseases","38 pages, 13 figures",,"10.1002/sim.9581",,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Mixed Models for Repeated Measures (MMRMs) are ubiquitous when analyzing
outcomes of clinical trials. However, the linearity of the fixed-effect
structure in these models largely restrict their use to estimating treatment
effects that are defined as linear combinations of effects on the outcome
scale. In some situations, alternative quantifications of treatment effects may
be more appropriate. In progressive diseases, for example, one may want to
estimate if a drug has cumulative effects resulting in increasing efficacy over
time or whether it slows the time progression of disease. This paper introduces
a class of nonlinear mixed-effects models called Progression Models for
Repeated Measures (PMRMs) that, based on a continuous-time extension of the
categorical-time parametrization of MMRMs, enables estimation of novel types of
treatment effects, including measures of slowing or delay of the time
progression of disease. Compared to conventional estimates of treatment effects
where the unit matches that of the outcome scale (e.g. 2 points benefit on a
cognitive scale), the time-based treatment effects can offer better
interpretability and clinical meaningfulness (e.g. 6 months delay in
progression of cognitive decline). The PMRM class includes conventionally used
MMRMs and related models for longitudinal data analysis, as well as variants of
previously proposed disease progression models as special cases. The potential
of the PMRM framework is illustrated using both simulated and historical data
from clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease with different types of
artificially simulated treatment effects. Compared to conventional models it is
shown that PMRMs can offer substantially increased power to detect
disease-modifying treatment effects where the benefit is increasing with
treatment duration.

over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for
compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens
should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of
training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a
predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget

uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1

asteroid's regolith.
  We create an approximate analytic theory of heat conduction on a slightly

the surface roughness.
  We derive an analytic formula that expresses the TYORP of a sinusoidal
surface in terms of its geometric and thermal properties. TYORP is maximal at
the thermal parameter of the order of unity and for the shape irregularities of
the order of the thermal wavelength. Application of this equation to Ryugu
predicts TYORP, which is 5-70 times greater than its normal YORP effect.
  The contribution of the small-scale regolith roughness to the YORP effect of
the asteroid can be comparable to the normal YORP and the tangential YORP
produced by boulders. The same theory can describe roughness on the asteroid
boulders, thus adding a new term to the previously considered TYORP created by
boulders.

insulator described by a Haldane-Hubbard model. We consider the topological
Hubbard model at $1/4$ filling of its corresponding noninteracting limit and in
the nearly flat band limit of its lower free-electronic bands. We show that it
is possible to define boson operators associated with two distinct spin-flip
excitations, one that changes (mixed-lattice excitations) and a second one that
preserves (same-lattice excitations) the index related with the two triangular
sublattices. Within the bosonization scheme, the fermionic model is mapped into
an effective interacting boson model, whose quadratic term is considered at the
harmonic approximation in order to determine the spin-wave excitation spectrum.
For both mixed and same-lattice excitations, we find that the spin-wave
spectrum is gapped and has two branches, with an energy gap between the lower
and the upper bands at the $K$ and $K'$ points of the first Brillouin zone.
Such a behavior is distinct from the one of the corresponding correlated Chern
insulator, whose spin-wave spectrum has a Goldstone mode at the center of the
first Brillouin zone and Dirac points at $K$ and $K'$ points. We also find some
evidences that the spin-wave bands for the same-lattice excitations might be
topologically nontrivial even in the completely flat band limit.

sensitivity in the NUV will provide important new insights into the evolution

in many fields of science and engineering. The conventional case of the
derivation of PDE mainly relies on first principles and empirical observation.
However, the development of machine learning technology allows us to mine
potential control equations from the massive amounts of stored data in a fresh
way. Although there has been considerable progress in the data-driven discovery
of PDE, the extant literature mostly focuses on the improvements of discovery
methods, without substantial breakthroughs in the discovery process itself,
including the principles for the construction of candidates and how to
incorporate physical priors. In this paper, through rigorous derivation of
formulas, novel physically enhanced machining learning discovery methods for
control equations: GSNN (Galileo Symbolic Neural Network) and LSNN (Lorentz
Symbolic Neural Network) are firstly proposed based on Galileo invariance and
Lorentz invariance respectively, setting forth guidelines for building the
candidates of discovering equations. The adoption of mandatory embedding of
physical constraints is fundamentally different from PINN in the form of the
loss function, thus ensuring that the designed Neural Network strictly obeys
the physical prior of invariance and enhancing the interpretability of the
network. By comparing the results with PDE-NET in numerical experiments of
Burgers equation and Sine-Gordon equation, it shows that the method presented
in this study has better accuracy, parsimony, and interpretability.

alternative solution to PGO, that directly exploits the cycle space. We
characterize the topology of the graph as a cycle matrix, and re-parameterize
the problem using relative poses, which are further constrained by a cycle

photographic images to also visualize future weather conditions.
  This is challenging, because photographic visualizations of weather forecasts
should look real, be free of obvious artifacts, and should match the predicted
weather conditions. The transition from observation to forecast should be
seamless, and there should be visual continuity between images for consecutive
lead times. We use conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to synthesize
such visualizations. The generator network, conditioned on the analysis and the
forecasting state of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, transforms
the present camera image into the future. The discriminator network judges
whether a given image is the real image of the future, or whether it has been
synthesized. Training the two networks against each other results in a
visualization method that scores well on all four evaluation criteria.
  We present results for three camera sites across Switzerland that differ in
climatology and terrain. We show that users find it challenging to distinguish
real from generated images, performing not much better than if they guessed
randomly. The generated images match the atmospheric, ground and illumination

variation of light elements that are affected by hot hydrogen burning (e.g.,
He, C, N, O). Several scenarios have been suggested to explain these
variations. Most involve multiple star formation episodes, where later
generations are born from material contaminated by the nucleosynthetic products
of the previous stellar generation(s). One difficulty in the modelling of such
scenarios is knowing the extent to which processed and pristine material are
mixed. In this context, beryllium abundances measured in turn-off stars of
different generations can provide new information. Beryllium originates from
cosmic-ray spallation and can only be destroyed inside stars. Beryllium
abundances can thus directly measure the degree of pollution of the material
that formed stars in globular clusters. Turn-off stars in globular clusters are
however faint and such studies are beyond the capabilities of current
instrumentation. In this work, we show the progress that the CUBES spectrograph
will bring to this area. Our simulations indicate that CUBES will enable the
detection of variations of about 0.6 dex in the Be abundances between stars
from different generations, in several nearby globular clusters with turn-off
magnitude down to $V$ = 18 mag.

during inflation to the two-field case. We identify the slow-roll parameter
$\eta$ as the quantity that can trigger the rapid growth of perturbations. Its
two components, $\eta_\parallel$ along the background trajectory and
$\eta_\perp$ perpendicular to it, remain small during most of the evolution,
apart from short intervals during which they take large, positive or negative,
values. The typical reason for the appearance of strong features in
$\eta_\parallel$ is sharp steps or inflection points in the inflaton potential,
while $\eta_\perp$ grows large during sharp turns in field space. We focus on
the additive effect of several features leading to the resonant growth of the
curvature spectrum. Three or four features in the evolution of $\eta$ are
sufficient in order to induce an enhancement of the power spectrum by six or
seven orders of magnitude, which can lead to the significant production of
primordial black holes and stochastic gravitational waves. A big part of our
study focuses on understanding the evolution of the perturbations and the
resulting spectra through analytic means. The presence of multiple features in
the background evolution points to a more complex inflationary paradigm, which
is also more natural in the multi-field case. The critical examination of this

deposited on the surface of an aqueous solution containing a surfactant,
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. After an induction stage during which the drop
stays axisymmetric, oscillations occur along the contact line. These
oscillations are succeeded by a spectacular spontaneous spinning of the drop.
The latter quickly takes the form of a two-tip `rotor' and the spinning rate
stabilizes at a constant value, no longer varying despite the gradual changes
of the drop shape and size. The drop eventually disappears due to the continual
dissolution and evaporation of dichloromethane. Schlieren visualizations and
particle image velocimetry are used to establish a consistent scenario capable
of explaining the evolution of the system. The Marangoni effect induced by the
dissolution of dichloromethane in the drop vicinity is shown to be responsible
for the observed dynamics. Arguments borrowed from dynamical systems theory and
from an existing low-order model allow us to explain qualitatively why the
system selects the spinning configuration. The geometry of the immersed part of
the drop is shown to play a crucial role in this selection process, as well as
in the regulation of the spinning rate.

with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the presence of the Zeeman field is the
so-called helical state, which is characterized by the phase modulation of the
order parameter, but zero supercurrent density. In this work we investigate the
realization of the helical state in a hybrid system with spatially separated
superconductivity and exchange field by considering S/F bilayer on top of a 3D
topological insulator. This system is characterized by strong spin-momentum
locking and, consequently, provides the most favorable conditions for the
helical state generation. The analysis is based on the microscopic theory in
terms of the quasiclassical Green's functions. We demonstrate that in the
bilayer the helical state survives if the exchange field has non-zero component
perpendicular to the S/F interface even in spite of the fact that the
superconducting order parameter and the exchange field are spatially separated.
At the same time, in this spatially inhomogeneous situation the helical state
is accompanied by the spontaneous currents distributed over the bilayer in such
a way as to have zero average. Further, we show that this hybrid helical state
gives rise to nonreciprocity in the system. We demonstrate the realization of
the superconducting diode effect and show that the degree of nonreciprocity is
very large in the considered system due to the strongest possible value of the
spin-momentum locking.

many public benchmarks. One of its crucial drawbacks is the quadratic
time-space complexity with respect to the input sequence length, which
prohibits the model to scale-up as well as process longer input audio
sequences. To solve this issue, numerous linear attention methods have been
proposed. However, these methods often have limited performance on ASR as they
treat tokens equally in modeling, neglecting the fact that the neighbouring
tokens are often more connected than the distanced tokens. In this paper, we
take this fact into account and propose a new locality-biased linear attention
for Conformer. It not only achieves higher accuracy than the vanilla Conformer,
but also enjoys linear space-time computational complexity. To be specific, we
replace the softmax attention with a locality-biased linear attention (LBLA)
mechanism in Conformer blocks. The LBLA contains a kernel function to ensure
the linear complexities and a cosine reweighing matrix to impose more weights
on neighbouring tokens. Extensive experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show
that by introducing this locality bias to the Conformer, our method achieves a
lower word error rate with more than 22% inference speed.

introduced the minimum Bayesian risk (MBR, one of the discriminative criteria)

on-the-fly decoding process in MBR-based methods results in the need for
pre-trained models and slow training speeds. To this end, novel algorithms are
proposed in this work to integrate another widely used discriminative

systems not only in the training stage but also in the decoding process. The
proposed LF-MMI training and decoding methods show their effectiveness on two

maintains the consistency between training and decoding; eschews the on-the-fly

process for accelerating particles in a variety of astrophysical sources. While
the standard prediction for strong shocks is that the spectrum of accelerated
particles is universal, $f(p)\propto p^{-4}$, numerous phenomena affect this
simple conclusion. In general, the non-linear dynamical reaction of accelerated
particles leads to a concave spectrum, steeper than $p^{-4}$ at momenta below a
few tens of GeV/c and harder than the standard prediction at high energies.
However, the non-linear effects become important in the presence of magnetic
field amplification, which in turn leads to higher values of the maximum
momentum $p_{max}$. It was recently discovered that the self-generated
perturbations that enhance particle scattering, when advected downstream, move
in the same direction as the background plasma, so that the effective
compression factor at the shock decreases and the spectrum becomes steeper. We

on weak supervisions like consistency loss to guide the learning, which,
inevitably, leads to inferior results in real-world scenarios with unseen
poses. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised approach that allows
us to explicitly generate 2D-3D pose pairs for augmenting supervision, through
a self-enhancing dual-loop learning framework. This is made possible via
introducing a reinforcement-learning-based imitator, which is learned jointly
with a pose estimator alongside a pose hallucinator; the three components form
two loops during the training process, complementing and strengthening one
another. Specifically, the pose estimator transforms an input 2D pose sequence
to a low-fidelity 3D output, which is then enhanced by the imitator that
enforces physical constraints. The refined 3D poses are subsequently fed to the
hallucinator for producing even more diverse data, which are, in turn,
strengthened by the imitator and further utilized to train the pose estimator.
Such a co-evolution scheme, in practice, enables training a pose estimator on
self-generated motion data without relying on any given 3D data. Extensive
experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields
encouraging results significantly outperforming the state of the art and, in
some cases, even on par with results of fully-supervised methods. Notably, it
achieves 89.1% 3D PCK on MPI-INF-3DHP under self-supervised cross-dataset

QPTAS for the metric Baker's problems in minor-free graphs. In this work, we
devise a new embedding technique to improve the treewidth bound of Cohen-Addad
et al. exponentially to $O_{\epsilon}(\log\log n)^2$. As a corollary, we obtain
the first efficient PTAS for the capacitated vehicle routing problem in
minor-free graphs. We also significantly improve the running time of the QPTAS
for the metric Baker's problems in minor-free graphs from
$n^{O_{\epsilon}(\log(n))}$ to $n^{O_{\epsilon}(\log\log(n))^3}$.
  Applying our embedding technique to planar graphs, we obtain a deterministic
embedding of planar graphs of diameter $D$ into graphs of treewidth
$O((\log\log n)^2)/\epsilon)$ and additive distortion $+\epsilon D$ that can be
constructed in nearly linear time. Important corollaries of our result include
a bicriteria PTAS for metric Baker's problems and a PTAS for the vehicle
routing problem with bounded capacity in planar graphs, both run in
almost-linear time. The running time of our algorithms is significantly better
than previous algorithms that require quadratic time.
  A key idea in our embedding is the construction of an (exact) emulator for
tree metrics with treewidth $O(\log\log n)$ and hop-diameter $O(\log \log n)$.
This result may be of independent interest.

the strategy deployed ensures the satisfaction of a set of constraints.
Further, often we have only partial information on the state of the system. We
study the problem of safe real-time decision making under uncertainty. In this
paper, we formulate a conservative stochastic contextual bandit formulation for
real-time decision making when an adversary chooses a distribution on the set
of possible contexts and the learner is subject to certain safety/performance
constraints. The learner observes only the context distribution and the exact
context is unknown, and the goal is to develop an algorithm that selects a
sequence of optimal actions to maximize the cumulative reward without violating
the safety constraints at any time step. By leveraging the UCB algorithm for
this setting, we propose a conservative linear UCB algorithm for stochastic
bandits with context distribution. We prove an upper bound on the regret of the
algorithm and show that it can be decomposed into three terms: (i) an upper
bound for the regret of the standard linear UCB algorithm, (ii) a constant term
(independent of time horizon) that accounts for the loss of being conservative
in order to satisfy the safety constraint, and (ii) a constant term
(independent of time horizon) that accounts for the loss for the contexts being
unknown and only the distribution being known. To validate the performance of
our approach we perform extensive simulations on synthetic data and on
real-world maize data collected through the Genomes to Fields (G2F) initiative.

efficiency of solving PDEs using spectral methods. These adaptive spectral
techniques are especially suited for accurately solving problems in unbounded

the spectral expansion order. There have been few analyses of numerical methods
for unbounded domain problems. Specifically, there is no analysis of adaptive
spectral methods to provide insight into how to increase efficiency and
accuracy through dynamical adjustment of parameters. In this paper, we perform
the first numerical analysis of the adaptive spectral method using generalized
Hermite functions in both one- and multi-dimensional problems. Our analysis
reveals why adaptive spectral methods work well when a ""frequency indicator"" of
the numerical solution is controlled. We then investigate how the
implementation of the adaptive spectral methods affects numerical results,
thereby providing guidelines for the proper tuning of parameters. Finally, we
further improve performance by extending the adaptive methods to allow
bidirectional basis function translation, and the prospect of carrying out
similar numerical analysis to solving PDEs arising from realistic
difficult-to-solve unbounded models with adaptive spectral methods is also
briefly discussed.

detection task, mainly due to the outperforming results of convolutional neural
networks. In this vein, anchor-based models have achieved the best results.
However, these models require prior information about the aspect and scales of
target objects, needing more hyperparameters to fit. In addition, using anchors
to fit bounding boxes seems far from how our visual system does the same visual
task. Instead, our visual system uses the interactions of different scene parts
to semantically identify objects, called perceptual grouping. An object
detection methodology closer to the natural model is anchor-free detection,
where models like FCOS or Centernet have shown competitive results, but these
have not yet exploited the concept of perceptual grouping. Therefore, to
increase the effectiveness of anchor-free models keeping the inference time
low, we propose to add non-local attention (NL modules) modules to boost the
feature map of the underlying backbone. NL modules implement the perceptual
grouping mechanism, allowing receptive fields to cooperate in visual
representation learning. We show that non-local modules combined with an FCOS

analysis of genetic association studies. When analyzing a binary trait via
logistic regression, important covariates such as age and sex are typically
included in the model. However, their effects are rarely properly considered in
power or sample size computation during study planning. Unlike when analyzing a
continuous trait, the power of association testing between a binary trait and a
genetic variant depends, explicitly, on covariate effects, even under the
assumption of gene-environment independence. Earlier work recognizes this
hidden factor but implemented methods are not flexible. We thus propose and
implement a generalized method for estimating power and sample size for
(discovery or replication) association studies of binary traits that a)
accommodates different types of non-genetic covariates E, b) deals with
different types of G-E relationships, and c) is computationally efficient.
Extensive simulation studies show that the proposed method is accurate and
computationally efficient for both prospective and retrospective sampling
designs with various covariate structures. A proof-of-principle application
focused on the understudied African sample in the UK Biobank data. Results show
that, in contrast to studying the continuous blood pressure trait, when
analyzing the binary hypertension trait ignoring covariate effects of age and
sex leads to overestimated power and underestimated replication sample size.

developed various indirect diagnostics of LyC escape. Using measurements of the
LyC from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), we present the first
statistical test of these diagnostics. While optical depth indicators based on
Ly{\alpha}, such as peak velocity separation and equivalent width, perform
well, we also find that other diagnostics, such as the [O III]/[O II] flux
ratio and star formation rate surface density, predict whether a galaxy is a
LCE. The relationship between these galaxy properties and the fraction of
escaping LyC flux suggests that LyC escape depends strongly on H I column
density, ionization parameter, and stellar feedback. We find LCEs occupy a
range of stellar masses, metallicities, star formation histories, and
ionization parameters, which may indicate episodic and/or different physical
causes of LyC escape.

early days when formal semantics was a hot topic. But, the word ""correct"" was
afterwards replaced by reliable, robust and trustworthy etc., a tradeoff
situation then. This is not because correctness is no longer important, but
because people found no way to get through in this direction. The tradeoff has
led software engineers to focus on techniques and testing tools. Rapid
development of software engineering has now reached a peak and programmers are
now working freely without worrying too much about bugs, since bugs are not
avoidable anyway.
  Is it meaningful to talk about program correctness today? Our answer is yes.
It is the time to seriously consider correctness again, before it is too late,
to prepare for the future. Future generation computer systems should be
correct, both syntactically (statically) and semantically (dynamically).
  The book ""OESPA: Semantic Oriented Theory of Programming"" (2019) by the first
author has opened a new direction for semantic study. Theoretically speaking,
it is possible now, based on OESPA, to compute program semantics from program
text so that program correctness could be proved.
  But, semantic computations and correctness proving cannot be done by hand
when the size of a program is big. Automatic tools are necessary. This paper
tries to lay a foundation for developing needed auto tools, so that OESPA is
enriched to serve future need. To this end, a new concept named conditional
semantic predicate is proposed. Concepts in OESPA, including semantic
functions, semantic predicates, semantic formulas and semantic calculus, are
re-represented in accordance. Such re-introduction is necessary since the book
is the only publication on semantic calculus so far. The new version of
semantic calculus illustrates how semantics auto-computation would be carried
out.

interrelate the global force variance with the mean potential energy curvature.

  Method for Reliability Analysis",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a powerful surrogate model-based
reliability analysis method. Generally, a PCE model with a higher expansion
order is usually required to obtain an accurate surrogate model for some
complex non-linear stochastic systems. However, the high-order PCE increases
the number of labeled data required for solving the expansion coefficients. To
alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a consistency regularization-based
deep polynomial chaos neural network (Deep PCNN) method, including the
low-order adaptive PCE model (the auxiliary model) and the high-order
polynomial chaos neural network (the main model). The expansion coefficients of
the main model are parameterized into the learnable weights of the polynomial
chaos neural network, realizing iterative learning of expansion coefficients to
obtain more accurate high-order PCE models. The auxiliary model uses a proposed
consistency regularization loss function to assist in training the main model.
The consistency regularization-based Deep PCNN method can significantly reduce
the number of labeled data in constructing a high-order PCE model without
losing accuracy by using few labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. A
numerical example validates the effectiveness of the consistency
regularization-based Deep PCNN method, and then this method is applied to
analyze the reliability of two aerospace engineering systems.

paramagnetic susceptibility. Therefore, it indicates that local moment starts
forming in the nearly commensurate CDW phase itself, which is well above the
temperature where the evidence of Mott insulating state is found in resistivity
measurement. In the commensurate CDW phase, temperature dependence of
susceptibility significantly deviates from the Curie-Weiss law and does not
show the magnetic properties expected from S = 1/2 spin on a two dimensional

oscillations usually decay in 1--4 periods. Recently, we observed a decayless
case of such oscillations in the corona. Aims: We try to understand the
physical process that maintains the decayless oscillation of the filament.
Methods: Multi-wavelength imaging observations and magnetograms are collected
to study the dynamics of the filament oscillation and its associated phenomena.
To explain the decayless oscillations, we also perform one-dimensional
hydrodynamic numerical simulations using the MPI-AMRVAC code. Results: In
observations, the filament oscillates decaylessly with a period of $36.4 \pm
0.3$ min for almost 4 hours before eruption. During oscillations, four
quasi-periodic jets emanate from a magnetic cancellation site near the
filament. The time interval between neighboring jets is $\sim 68.9 \pm 1.0$
min. Numerical simulations constrained by the observations reproduced the
decayless longitudinal oscillations. However, it is surprising to find that the
period of the decayless oscillations is not consistent with the pendulum model.
Conclusions: We propose that the decayless longitudinal oscillations of the
filament are maintained by quasi-periodic jets, which is verified by the
hydrodynamic simulations. More importantly, it is found that, when driven by
quasi-periodic jets, the period of the filament longitudinal oscillations
depends also on the driving period of the jets, not simply the pendulum period.
With a parameter survey in simulations, we derived a formula, by which one can
derive the pendulum oscillation period using the observed period of decayless
filament oscillations and the driving periods of jets.

the importance of time-critical systems, temporal robustness of temporal logic
specifications has not been studied, especially from a control design point of
view. We define synchronous and asynchronous temporal robustness and show that
these notions quantify the robustness with respect to synchronous and
asynchronous time shifts in the predicates of the temporal logic specification.
It is further shown that the synchronous temporal robustness upper bounds the
asynchronous temporal robustness. We then study the control design problem in
which we aim to design a control law that maximizes the temporal robustness of
a dynamical system. Our solution consists of a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) encoding that can be used to obtain a sequence of optimal control
inputs. While asynchronous temporal robustness is arguably more nuanced than
synchronous temporal robustness, we show that control design using synchronous
temporal robustness is computationally more efficient. This trade-off can be
exploited by the designer depending on the particular application at hand. We
conclude the paper with a variety of case studies.

statistical-to-computational gap: the densities at which known efficient
algorithms find solutions are far below the threshold for the existence of
solutions. Furthermore, the $\texttt{SBP}$ exhibits a striking structural
property: at all positive constraint densities almost all of its solutions are
'totally frozen' singletons separated by large Hamming distance
\cite{perkins2021frozen,abbe2021proof}. This suggests that finding a solution
to the $\texttt{SBP}$ may be computationally intractable. At the same time, the
$\texttt{SBP}$ does admit polynomial-time search algorithms at low enough
densities. A conjectural explanation for this conundrum was put forth in
\cite{baldassi2020clustering}: efficient algorithms succeed in the face of
freezing by finding exponentially rare clusters of large size. However, it was
discovered recently that such rare large clusters exist at all subcritical
densities, even at those well above the limits of known efficient algorithms
\cite{abbe2021binary}. Thus the driver of the statistical-to-computational gap
exhibited by this model remains a mystery.
  In this paper, we conduct a different landscape analysis to explain the
algorithmic tractability of this problem. We show that at high enough densities
the $\texttt{SBP}$ exhibits the multi Overlap Gap Property ($m-$OGP), an
intricate geometrical property known to be a rigorous barrier for large classes
of algorithms. Our analysis shows that the $m-$OGP threshold (a) is well below
the satisfiability threshold; and (b) matches the best known algorithmic
threshold up to logarithmic factors as $m\to\infty$. We then prove that the
$m-$OGP rules out the class of stable algorithms for the $\texttt{SBP}$ above
this threshold. We conjecture that the $m \to \infty$ limit of the $m$-OGP
threshold marks the algorithmic threshold for the problem.

fidelity between the steady state of the system and the effective thermal

the steady state is found to be an exact thermal state, which is attributed to
the fact that the transfer rates between all pairs of coupled eigenstates
satisfy detailed balance condition. The scenario changes when there are more
lattice sites, where the detailed balance condition does not hold any more, but
remains an accurate approximation. Remarkably, our scheme performs very well at
low and high temperature regimes, with the fidelity close to one. The
performance at the intermediate temperature regime (where a crossover into a
Bose condensed regime occurs) is slightly worse, and the fidelity shows a
gentle decrease with increasing system size. We also discuss the interacting
cases. In contrast to the non-interacting cases, the scheme is found to perform
better at a higher temperature. Another difference is that the minimal
temperature that can be engineered is nonzero and increases with the
interaction strength.

morality, security, and privacy. Although existing face forgery classifiers
achieve promising performance on detecting fake images, these methods are
vulnerable to adversarial examples with injected imperceptible perturbations on
the pixels. Meanwhile, many face forgery detectors always utilize the frequency
diversity between real and fake faces as a crucial clue. In this paper, instead
of injecting adversarial perturbations into the spatial domain, we propose a
frequency adversarial attack method against face forgery detectors. Concretely,
we apply discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the input images and introduce a
fusion module to capture the salient region of adversary in the frequency
domain. Compared with existing adversarial attacks (e.g. FGSM, PGD) in the
spatial domain, our method is more imperceptible to human observers and does
not degrade the visual quality of the original images. Moreover, inspired by
the idea of meta-learning, we also propose a hybrid adversarial attack that
performs attacks in both the spatial and frequency domains. Extensive
experiments indicate that the proposed method fools not only the spatial-based
detectors but also the state-of-the-art frequency-based detectors effectively.
In addition, the proposed frequency attack enhances the transferability across
face forgery detectors as black-box attacks.

4 systems with the public data without lens modeling. According to simulations,
for RX J1131-like systems (wide variation in time delay between images) the
TDSL measurement can be achieved with the precision about $\Delta t=0.5$ day
with 4 seasons campaign length and 1 day cadence. This accuracy is comparable
to the up-coming TDCOSMO project. And it would be better when the campaign
length keeps longer and with high cadence. As a result, the capability of
Muztagh-Ata 1.93m telescope allows it to join the network of TDSL

generalize better to new, unseen environments. Empirically, on both the

  Forest Cover: Generalizing for Different Geographical Regions","5 pages, 2 figures, includes additional experiments",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Forest plays a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating
climate change besides maintaining the world's biodiversity. The existing
satellite-based forest monitoring system utilizes supervised learning
approaches that are limited to a particular region and depend on manually
annotated data to identify forest. This work envisages forest identification as
a few-shot semantic segmentation task to achieve generalization across
different geographical regions. The proposed few-shot segmentation approach
incorporates a texture attention module in the prototypical network to
highlight the texture features of the forest. Indeed, the forest exhibits a
characteristic texture different from other classes, such as road, water, etc.
In this work, the proposed approach is trained for identifying tropical forests
of South Asia and adapted to determine the temperate forest of Central Europe
with the help of a few (one image for 1-shot) manually annotated support images
of the temperate forest. An IoU of 0.62 for forest class (1-way 1-shot) was
obtained using the proposed method, which is significantly higher (0.46 for
PANet) than the existing few-shot semantic segmentation approach. This result
demonstrates that the proposed approach can generalize across geographical
regions for forest identification, creating an opportunity to develop a global
forest cover identification tool.

to Earth and thereby show how the area of coronal holes and the size of their
boundary regions affect the HSS velocity, temperature, and density near Earth.
We presume that velocity, temperature, and density profiles form across the HSS
cross section close to the Sun and that these spatial profiles translate into
corresponding temporal profiles in a given radial direction due to the solar
rotation. These temporal distributions drive the stream interface to the
preceding slow solar wind plasma and disperse with distance from the Sun. The
HSS properties at 1 AU are then given by all HSS plasma parcels launched from
the Sun that did not run into the stream interface at Earth distance. We show
that the velocity plateau region of HSSs as seen at 1 AU, if apparent,
originates from the center region of the HSS close to the Sun, whereas the
velocity tail at 1 AU originates from the trailing boundary region. The peak
velocity of HSSs at Earth further depends on the longitudinal width of the HSS
close to the Sun. The temperature and density of HSS plasma parcels at Earth
depend on their radial expansion from the Sun to Earth. The radial expansion is
determined by the velocity gradient across the HSS boundary region close to the
Sun and gives the velocity-temperature and density-temperature relationships at
Earth their specific shape. When considering a large number of HSSs, the
presumed correlation between the HSS velocities and temperatures close to the
Sun degrades only slightly up to 1 AU, but the correlation between the
velocities and densities is strongly disrupted up to 1 AU due to the radial
expansion. Finally, we show how the number of particles of the piled-up slow
solar wind in the stream interaction region depends on the velocities and
densities of the HSS and preceding slow solar wind plasma.

reached a high level of accuracy for object counting by assuming that object
counting is equivalent to the integration of the density map. However, this
model fails when objects show significant overlap regarding accurate
localization. We propose an alternative method to count and localize objects
from the density map to overcome this limitation. Our procedure includes the
following three key aspects: 1) Proposing a new counting method based on the
statistical properties of the density map, 2) optimizing the counting results
for those objects which are well-detected based on the proposed counting
method, and 3) improving localization of poorly detected objects using the
proposed counting method as prior information. Validation includes processing
of microscopy data with known ground truth and comparison with other models
that use conventional processing of the density map. Our results show improved
performance in counting and localization of objects in 2D and 3D microscopy

there is no consensus around learning approaches to use in a high-dimensional

for analyzing/predicting recurrent events and at comparing them to standard

review (LR) was conducted to provide state-of-the-art methodology. Data were
then simulated including variations of the number of variables and proportion
of active variables. Learning algorithms from the LR were compared to standard
methods in such simulation scheme. Evaluation measures were Harrell's
concordance index (C-index), Kim's C-index and error rate for active variables.
Results Seven publications were identified, consisting in four methodological
studies, one application paper and two review. The broken adaptive ridge
penalization and the RankDeepSurv deep neural network were used for comparison.
On simulated data, the standard models failed when p>n. Penalized Andersen-Gill

accounts for the non-uniform behaviour of the docoherence parameters of qubits.
Additionally, we use the i.ni.d model to study how it affects the performance
of a specific family of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes known as planar
codes. For this purpose we employ data from four state-of-the-art
superconducting processors: ibmq\_brooklyn, ibm\_washington, Zuchongzhi and

overestimates the performance of surface codes, which can suffer up to $95\%$

methods which enhance the performance of planar codes under i.ni.d. noise. The
first method involves a so-called re-weighting process of the conventional
minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, while the second one exploits
the relationship that exists between code performance and qubit arrangement in

learning systems by allowing multiple clients to participate in a learning task
under the coordination of a central server without exchanging their private
data. However, recent studies have revealed that private information can still
be leaked through shared gradient information. To further protect user's
privacy, several defense mechanisms have been proposed to prevent privacy
leakage via gradient information degradation methods, such as using additive
noise or gradient compression before sharing it with the server. In this work,
we validate that the private training data can still be leaked under certain
defense settings with a new type of leakage, i.e., Generative Gradient Leakage
(GGL). Unlike existing methods that only rely on gradient information to
reconstruct data, our method leverages the latent space of generative
adversarial networks (GAN) learned from public image datasets as a prior to
compensate for the informational loss during gradient degradation. To address
the nonlinearity caused by the gradient operator and the GAN model, we explore
various gradient-free optimization methods (e.g., evolution strategies and
Bayesian optimization) and empirically show their superiority in reconstructing
high-quality images from gradients compared to gradient-based optimizers. We
hope the proposed method can serve as a tool for empirically measuring the
amount of privacy leakage to facilitate the design of more robust defense

acquisition, video recovery, background/foreground separation into a single
framework. To achieve this, a smooth robust tensor completion (SRTC) model is
proposed to recover the data and decompose it into the static background and
smooth foreground, respectively. Specifically, the static background is modeled
by the low-rank tucker decomposition and the smooth foreground (moving objects)
is modeled by the spatiotemporal continuity, which is enforced by the total
variation regularization. An efficient algorithm based on tensor proximal
alternating minimization (tenPAM) is implemented to solve the proposed model
with global convergence guarantee under very mild conditions. Extensive
experiments on real data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for background/foreground

simulation is no longer based on the structure of the group theory, but based
on the structure of the tensor category. This could enable many systems that
could not be efficiently quantum simulated before.In this article we give an

require many new parameters and are hyperparameter sensitive. They
significantly increase training time, memory cost, and potential latency which
can prove costly for resource-limited or real-time applications. In this paper,
we present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT)
algorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a
unique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby
incurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network
latency compared to standard adversarial training. In particular, we add
configurable scaled noise to the weight tensors that enables a trade-off
between clean and adversarial performance. Extensive experiments show that
FLOAT can yield SOTA performance improving both clean and perturbed image
classification by up to ~6% and ~10%, respectively. Moreover, real hardware
measurement shows that FLOAT can reduce the training time by up to 1.43x with
fewer model parameters of up to 1.47x on iso-hyperparameter settings compared

(IL) devices leads to the formation of an electrical double layer (a thin layer
of ions with a thickness of a few nanometers) at the graphene/IL interface due
to the local potential difference which also controls the local conductivity.
This structure provides a memristive mechanism based on a dynamic p-n junction

the same dataset fed into a QNN and compare that with performance of a
classical NN model. We built an NEQR model circuit to pre-process the same data
and feed the images into the QNN. Our results showed marginal improvements
(only about ~5.0%) where the QNN performance with NEQR exceeded the performance

concept of renormalization in atomic physics. We study quantum dynamics of a
model of a nonrelativistic single electron atom coupled to the quantum
radiation field in the dipole approximation. An interaction between the
electron and the radiation field is regularized, using a suitable cutoff
prescription which eliminates the coupling of the electron to the highly
ultraviolet (UV) field modes. Subsequently, we analyze the corresponding
Heisenberg picture equations of motion, and focus on behavior of physical
observables in the limit of a pointlike electron (i.e., in the limit when the
above mentioned UV cutoff is gradually lifted to infinity). We identify the
radiation reaction force acting on the electron, and show that this force
actually diverges towards infinity when gradually removing the UV cutoff. Such
an analysis leads ultimately to an unique renormalization prescription for the
electron mass, as well as to determination of the Abraham-Lorentz force acting
on the electron. Dependence of the just sketched renormalization procedure upon
the spatial dimension is highlighted. Finally, we present an example
calculation of the atomic level shifts by means of the renormalized
perturbation theory, and formulate also the renormalized mean field theory.

(2022)",,"10.1140/epjs/s11734-022-00512-x",,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Irregularly sampled time series analysis is a common problem in various
disciplines. Since conventional methods are not directly applicable to
irregularly sampled time series, a common interpolation approach is used;
however, this causes data distortion and consequently biases further analyses.
We propose a method that yields a regularly sampled time series spectrum of
costs with minimum information loss. Each time series in this spectrum is a
stationary series and acts as a difference filter. The transformation costs
approach derives the differences between consecutive and arbitrarily sized
segments. After obtaining regular sampling, recurrence plot analysis is
performed to distinguish regime transitions. The approach is applied to a
prototypical model to validate its performance and to different palaeoclimate
proxy data sets located around Africa to identify critical climate transition
periods during the last 5 million years and their characteristic properties.

  supervised learning via Wikipedia",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  An overwhelming majority of the world's human population lives in urban areas
and cities. Understanding a city's transportation typology is immensely
valuable for planners and policy makers whose decisions can potentially impact
millions of city residents. Despite the value of understanding a city's
typology, labeled data (city and it's typology) is scarce, and spans at most a
few hundred cities in the current transportation literature. To break this
barrier, we propose a supervised machine learning approach to predict a city's
typology given the information in its Wikipedia page. Our method leverages
recent breakthroughs in natural language processing, namely sentence-BERT, and
shows how the text-based information from Wikipedia can be effectively used as
a data source for city typology prediction tasks that can be applied to over
2000 cities worldwide. We propose a novel method for low-dimensional city
representation using a city's Wikipedia page, which makes supervised learning
of city typology labels tractable even with a few hundred labeled samples.
These features are used with labeled city samples to train binary classifiers
(logistic regression) for four different city typologies: (i) congestion, (ii)
auto-heavy, (iii) transit-heavy, and (iv) bike-friendly cities resulting in
reasonably high AUC scores of 0.87, 0.86, 0.61 and 0.94 respectively. Our
approach provides sufficient flexibility for incorporating additional variables
in the city typology models and can be applied to study other city typologies
as well. Our findings can assist a diverse group of stakeholders in
transportation and urban planning fields, and opens up new opportunities for
using text-based information from Wikipedia (or similar platforms) as data
sources in such fields.

tasks for investment decisions. Instead, we aim to promote a better
understanding of financial markets with machine learning techniques. Leveraging
the tremendous progress in deep learning models for natural language
processing, we construct a hierarchical Reformer ([15]) model capable of
processing a large document level dataset, SEDAR, from canadian financial
regulatory filings. Using this model, we show that it is possible to predict
trade volume changes using regulatory filings. We adapt the pretraining task of
HiBERT ([36]) to obtain good sentence level representations using a large
unlabelled document dataset. Finetuning the model to successfully predict trade
volume changes indicates that the model captures a view from financial markets
and processing regulatory filings is beneficial. Analyzing the attention
patterns of our model reveals that it is able to detect some indications of
material information without explicit training, which is highly relevant for
investors and also for the market surveillance mandate of financial regulators.

models. However, prior work on pruning Transformers requires retraining the
models. This can add high training cost and high complexity to model
deployment, making it difficult to use in many practical situations. To address
this, we propose a fast post-training pruning framework for Transformers that
does not require any retraining. Given a resource constraint and a sample
dataset, our framework automatically prunes the Transformer model using
structured sparsity methods. To retain high accuracy without retraining, we
introduce three novel techniques: (i) a lightweight mask search algorithm that
finds which heads and filters to prune based on the Fisher information; (ii)
mask rearrangement that complements the search algorithm; and (iii) mask tuning
that reconstructs the output activations for each layer. We apply our method to
BERT-base and DistilBERT, and we evaluate its effectiveness on GLUE and SQuAD
benchmarks. Our framework achieves up to 2.0x reduction in FLOPs and 1.56x
speedup in inference latency, while maintaining < 1% loss in accuracy.
Importantly, our framework prunes Transformers in less than 3 minutes on a
single GPU, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than existing pruning
approaches that retrain the models.

(VNS) and Huey. The VNS, similar in name and function to the DNS, is a system
to reserve and use ""wake words"" to activate Artificial Intelligence (AI)
devices. Just like you can say ""Hey Siri"" to activate Apple's personal
assistant, we propose using the VNS in smart speakers and other devices to
route wake requests based on commands such as ""turn off"", ""open grocery
shopping list"" or ""271, start flash card review of my computer vision class"".
We also introduce Huey, an unambiguous Natural Language to interact with AI
devices. We aim to standardize voice interactions to a universal reach similar
to that of other systems such as phone numbering, with an agreed world-wide
approach to assign and use numbers, or the Internet's DNS, with a standard
naming system, that has helped flourish popular services including the
World-Wide-Web, FTP, and email. Just like these standards are ""neutral"", we
also aim to endow the VNS with ""wake neutrality"" so that each participant can
develop its own digital voice. We focus on voice as a starting point to talk to
any IoT object and explain briefly how the VNS may be expanded to other AI
technologies enabling person-to-machine conversations (really
machine-to-machine), including computer vision or neural interfaces. We also
describe briefly considerations for a broader set of standards, MIT Open AI
(MOA), including a reference architecture to serve as a starting point for the
development of a general conversational commerce infrastructure that has
standard ""Wake Words"", NLP commands such as ""Shopping Lists"" or ""Flash Card
Reviews"", and personalities such as Pi or 271. Privacy and security are key
elements considered because of speech-to-text errors and the amount of personal
information contained in a voice sample.
