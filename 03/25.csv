of a constraint leads to an irrevocable loss, such as breakage of a valuable
experimental resource/platform or loss of human life. Such problems are
referred to as safe optimization problems (SafeOPs). While SafeOPs have
received attention in the machine learning community in recent years, there was
little interest in the evolutionary computation (EC) community despite some
early attempts between 2009 and 2011. Moreover, there is a lack of acceptable
guidelines on how to benchmark different algorithms for SafeOPs, an area where
the EC community has significant experience in. Driven by the need for more
efficient algorithms and benchmark guidelines for SafeOPs, the objective of
this paper is to reignite the interest of this problem class in the EC
community. To achieve this we (i) provide a formal definition of SafeOPs and
contrast it to other types of optimization problems that the EC community is
familiar with, (ii) investigate the impact of key SafeOP parameters on the
performance of selected safe optimization algorithms, (iii) benchmark EC
against state-of-the-art safe optimization algorithms from the machine learning
community, and (iv) provide an open-source Python framework to replicate and
extend our work.

for the approximate computation of parametric solutions for this problem. The
first approach transforms an instance of the parametric problem into an
instance with piecewise quadratic cost functions by interpolating the marginal
cost functions. The new instance can be solved exactly with an algorithm we
developed in prior work. In the second approach, we compute a fixed number of
non-parametric solutions and interpolate the resulting flows yielding an
approximate solution for the original, parametric problem. For both methods we
formulate explicit bounds on the step sizes used in the respective
interpolations that guarantee relative and absolute error margins. Finally, we
test our approaches on real-world traffic and gas instances in an empirical

of heat penetration into live tissue has long been limited by the difficulty of
obtaining high-fidelity thermodynamic models. Traditionally, in complex
thermodynamic systems, it is often infeasible to estimate the thermophysical
parameters of spatiotemporally varying processes, forcing the adoption of
model-free control architectures. This comes at the cost of losing any
robustness guarantees, and implies a need for extensive real-life testing. In
recent years, however, infrared cameras and other thermographic equipment have
become readily applicable to these processes, allowing for a real-time,
non-invasive means of sensing the thermal state of a process. In this work, we
present a novel physics-based approach to learning a thermal process's dynamics
directly from such real-time thermographic data, while focusing attention on
regions with high thermal activity. We call this process, which applies to any
higher-dimensional scalar field, attention-based noise robust averaging (ANRA).
Given a partial-differential equation model structure, we show that our
approach is robust against noise, and can be used to initialize optimization
routines to further refine parameter estimates. We demonstrate our method on
several simulation examples, as well as by applying it to electrosurgical
thermal response data on in vivo porcine skin tissue.

it achieves lower MLM loss in fewer epochs, across a variety of settings. In
addition, GP-TS pre-trained TLMs attain competitive downstream performance,
while avoiding expensive hyperparameter grid search. GP-TS provides an

themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to
budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems
during data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a
systematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in
which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level
hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from
algorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as
""subgroups""; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of
the hierarchy, as ""sources"". To characterize the problem, we introduce the
concept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias
in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes
and the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable
to unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse
but unlabeled dataset, called the ""deployment set"", to learn a representation
that is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the
support of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order
to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples
observed by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved
for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the
deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments
on several datasets and variants of the problem.

chiral symmetry breaking without confinement. It is usually asserted that the
massless Schwinger model is always deconfined and a string tension emerges only
when a mass for the fermion field is turned on. We show that in the presence of
these four-fermion operators, the massless theory can in fact confine. One of
the four-fermion deformations is chirally neutral, and is a marginal
deformation. The other operator can be relevant or irrelevant, and respects a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup of chiral symmetry for even $N$, hence forbidding a
mass term. When it is relevant, even the exactly massless theory exhibits both
confinement and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. The construction is
analogous to QCD(adj) in 2d. While the theory without four-fermion deformations
is deconfined, the theory with these deformations is generically in a confining
phase. We study the model on $\mathbb{R}^2$ using bosonization, and also
analyze the mechanism of confinement on $\mathbb{R}\times S^1$, where we find
that confinement is driven by fractional instantons.

stress. The front barrier is pierced by a gate, whose opening triggers local
unjamming. The rafts are compressed by moving only one of the two barriers in
the vicinity of which folds form. Using high speed imaging, we follow the
folded, jammed, and unjammed raft areas and measure the velocity fields inside
and outside of the initially confined domain. Two very different behaviors
develop. For rafts compressed by the back barrier, only partial unjamming
occurs. At the end of the process, many folds remain and the back stress does
not relax. The flow develops only along the compression axis and the particles
passing the gate form a dense raft whose width is the gate width. For rafts
compressed at the front, quasi-total unjamming is observed. No folds persist
and only minimal stress remains, if any. The particles flow along the
compression axis but also normally to it and form, after the gate, a rather
circular and not dense assembly. We attribute this difference to the opposite
orientation of the force chain network that builds up from the compressed side
and branchs. For rafts compressed at the gate side, keystone particles are
immediately removed which enhances local disentanglement and leads to large
scale unjamming. In contrast, for back compressed rafts, the force chain
network redirects the stress laterally forming arches around the gate and
resulting in a limited unjamming process.

for designing coherent continual learning methods in ViTs. We first carry out
an evaluation of established continual learning regularization techniques. We
then examine the effect of regularization when applied to two key enablers of
SAM: (a) the contextualized embedding layers, for their ability to capture
well-scaled representations with respect to the values, and (b) the prescaled
attention maps, for carrying value-independent global contextual information.
We depict the perks of each distilling strategy on two image recognition
benchmarks (CIFAR100 and ImageNet-32) -- while (a) leads to a better overall
accuracy, (b) helps enhance the rigidity by maintaining competitive
performances. Furthermore, we identify the limitation imposed by the symmetric
nature of regularization losses. To alleviate this, we propose an asymmetric
variant and apply it to the pooled output distillation (POD) loss adapted for
ViTs. Our experiments confirm that introducing asymmetry to POD boosts its
plasticity while retaining stability across (a) and (b). Moreover, we
acknowledge low forgetting measures for all the compared methods, indicating
that ViTs might be naturally inclined continual learner

discrepancy between Jupiter's observed high-degree tidal response and the
theoretical equilibrium tidal response, namely the Love number $k_{42}$. Here,
we propose an interpretation for this puzzling disagreement based on an
interior-orbital resonance between internal gravity waves trapped in Jupiter's
dilute core and the orbital motion of Io. We use simple Jupiter models to
calculate a fractional correction $\Delta k_{42}$ to the equilibrium tidal
response that comes from the dynamical tidal response of a $g$-mode trapped in
Jupiter's dilute core. Our results suggest that an extended dilute core
($r\gtrsim0.7R_J$) produces an interior-orbital resonance with Io that modifies
Jupiter's tidal response in $\Delta k_{42}\sim-11\%$, allowing us to fit Juno's
$k_{42}$. In our proposed self-consistent scenario, Jupiter's dilute core
evolves in resonant locking with Io's orbital migration, which allows the
interior-orbital resonance to persist over geological timescales. This scenario
requires a dilute core that becomes smoother or shrinks over time, together
with a $_4^2g_1$ mode ($\ell,m,n=4,2,1$) with resonant tidal dissipation
reaching $Q_4\sim1000$. Jupiter's dilute core evolution path and the
dissipation mechanism for the resonant $_4^2g_1$ mode are uncertain and
motivate future analysis. No other alternative exists so far to explain the
$7\sigma$ discrepancy in Juno $k_{42}$. Our proposed interior-orbital resonance
can be tested by Juno observations of $k_{42}$ tides raised on Jupiter by
Europa as obtained at the end of the extended mission (mid 2025), and by future

that foreground and background sources also contribute to the total sub-mm

formation activity of our sources with samples of normal star-forming galaxies
(SFGs), sub-mm galaxies, and CO-detected cluster and protocluster galaxies at
similar redshifts. We find that the PHz-IRAM sources are mainly normal SFGs,
with only ~20% undergoing a starburst phase. The PHz-IRAM sources are
characterized by star formation rates and gas masses that are, on average,
eight and five times higher than those typical of normal SFGs at similar
redshifts. Their dust temperatures, and depletion timescales are instead
consistent with those of normal SFGs. The analysis of the CO spectral line
energy distribution, available for ten sources, peaks at Jup=3 in most of the
cases, implying low gas excitation. These properties imply that a significant
fraction of the PHz-IRAM sources contains extended, and cold molecular gas
reservoirs at low excitation, and that their star-formation is driven by
secular processes. Multiplicity and moderate gravitational lensing might also
play a role in producing the observed properties. We find that the highest
star-forming protoclusters drawn from the large volume simulations, have
similar SFRs as the PHz protoclusters, but separate out into a larger number of
SFGs. (Abridged)

COVID-19, to estimate the probability of admission to ICU, the probability of
death in hospital for patients before and after ICU admission, the lengths of
stay in hospital, and how all these vary with age and gender. One modelling
framework is based on defining transition-specific hazard functions for
competing risks. A less commonly used framework defines partially-latent
subpopulations who will experience each subsequent event, and uses a mixture
model to estimate the probability that an individual will experience each
event, and the distribution of the time to the event given that it occurs. We
compare the advantages and disadvantages of these two frameworks, in the

model parameters, the computational efficiency of estimating the quantities of
interest, implementation in software and assessing goodness of fit. In the
example, we find that some groups appear to be at very low risk of some events,
in particular ICU admission, and these are best represented by using
""cure-rate"" models to define transition-specific hazards. We provide
general-purpose software to implement all the models we describe in the

bound states, we find that the critical quasiperiodicity that signals the
transition to localization is always bounded by the standard Aubry-Andr\'e
critical point, whereas attractively bound dimers get localized at larger
quasiperiodic modulations when the range of the hopping increases. Extensive

provide the first joint ranking of optical flow methods considering both

with a 25 MeV $Z'$ that couples to muons and has a $q^2$ dependent $b - s$

observable $R_{\phi}$, $Q_{4,5}$ along with $R_{K^{(*)}}$ in the high $q^2$. We
find that a precise measurements of these observables can provide a good

Fuzzy, Wave, Ultralight dark matter model) has received much attention due to

Several challenges of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model can be explained very
easily and naturally by the SFDM model. Two of these challenges are to describe
the anomalous trajectories of satellite galaxies called the Vast Polar
Structure (VPOS) and to explain the Fermi Bubbles (FB) observed in our galaxy.
In Phys.Rev.D103(2021)083535 an alternative explanation for VPOS was shown
using the SFDM excited states, explaining the anomalous trajectories in a
natural and simple way. In this work we use the same dark matter structure to
show that these excited states of the SFDM can provide a very simple and
natural explanation for the FB, assuming that the SFDM is a kind of dark boson.
If this assumption is correct, we should see FB in several more galaxies and
continue to see gamma-ray events at higher energies, these observations would
take place in the near future and could be crucial to the ultimate answer to
the nature of dark matter.

the low order gravity, high order gravity, rotation rate, and moment of inertia
(MOI) in constraining planetary structure. We attempt to explore all possible
interior density structures of a planet that are consistent with hypothetical
gravity data, via MCMC sampling of parameterized density profiles. When the
gravity field is poorly known, as it is today, uncertainties in the rotation
rate on the order of 10 minutes are unimportant, as they are interchangeable
with uncertainties in the gravity coefficients. By the same token, when the
gravity field is precisely determined the rotation rate must be known to
comparable precision. When gravity and rotation are well known the MOI becomes
well-constrained, limiting the usefulness of independent MOI determinations
unless they are extraordinarily precise. For Uranus and Neptune, density
profiles can be well-constrained. However, the non-uniqueness of the relative
roles of H/He, watery volatiles, and rock in the deep interior will still
persist with high-precision gravity data. Nevertheless, the locations and
magnitudes (in pressure-space) of any large-scale composition gradient regions

presented using the derived second order corrections. Stability analyses are
subsequently carried out using the proposed framework for two representative

is established that the obtained Floquet multipliers and Lyapunov spectrum
accurately predict the stability of the dynamical states, as validated by their

is still a challenge. In this work, to reduce the thermal conductivity and thus
improve the overall thermoelectric performances, point and extended defects
were generated in epitaxial 111-ScN thin films by implantation using argon
ions. The films were investigated by structural, optical, electrical, and
thermoelectric characterization methods. The results demonstrated that argon
implantation leads to the formation of stable defects (up to 750 K operating
temperature) were identified as interstitial type defect clusters and so-called
argon-vacancy complexes. The insertion of those specific defects induces
acceptor-type deep levels in the bandgap yielding to a reduce of the free
carrier mobility. With a reduce electrical conductivity, the irradiated sample
exhibited higher Seebeck coefficient maintaining the power factor of the film.
The thermal conductivity is strongly reduced from 12 to 3 W.m-1.K-1 at 300 K,
showing the effect of defects in increasing phonon scattering. Subsequent high
temperature annealing, at 1573 K, leads to the progressive evolution of
defects: the initial clusters of interstitial evolved to the benefit of smaller
clusters and the formation of bubble. Thus, the number of free carriers, the
resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient are almost restored but the mobility of
the carriers remains low and a 30% drop in thermal conductivity is still
effective (8.5 W.m-1.K-1). This study shows that the control defect engineering
with defects introduced by irradiation using noble gases in a thermoelectric
coating can be an attractive method to enhance the figure of merit of
thermoelectric materials.

observed in various geophysical systems are commonly explained in terms of
statistical mechanics. Different from ordinary systems, for a two-dimensional
flow, the absolute temperature defined for a statistical equilibrium can take
negative values. In a state of negative temperature, the second law of
thermodynamics predicts that energy in microscopic fluctuations is irreversibly
converted to a macroscopic form. This study explores the possibility of this
one-way energy conversion in a two-dimensional flow using a basic conceptual
model. We consider an inviscid incompressible fluid contained in a bounded
domain, the shape of which is distorted by an externally imposed force. Unlike
the usual fixed boundary cases, the flow energy within the domain is exchanged
with the external system via pressure work through the moving lateral boundary.
Concurrently, the flow field remains constrained by vorticity conservation.
Beginning from a state of Kraichnan's grand-canonical ensemble, when the domain
shape is distorted from one shape to another in a finite time, the Jarzynski
equality is established. This equality states that, on average, the direction
of a net energy flow through the boundary during a cycle of domain distortion
changes with the sign of the initial temperature of the system. Numerical
experiments are carried out to verify this theoretical argument and to
investigate the parameter dependence of the energy exchange rate.

proposed the idea to explore full magnetic phase diagram in NRTS samples in
which the superconducting order parameter is suppressed by the magnetic element

theory of the electron-phonon mediated superconductivity predicts the
suppression of the order parameter in three-dimensional s-wave superconductor.

La with the magnetic rare earth Nd in the $La_{1-x}Nd_{x}H_{10-y}$. As a
result, $T_c$ in the $La_{1-x}Nd_{x}H_{10-y}$ (x=0.09) decreases to Tc~120 K,
and the upper critical field decreases to $B_{c2}(T=41 K)=55 T$. While the
exact hydrogen content should be further established in the

the day-side infrared thermal spectrum of an exoplanet. These emission lines,
found in the atmosphere of the transiting ultra hot Jupiter (UHJ) WASP-33 b,
provide unambiguous evidence of its thermal inversion. Using spectra from the
MMT Exoplanet Atmosphere Survey (MEASURE, $R\sim15,000$), covering pre- and
post-eclipse phases, we cross-correlate with 1D PHOENIX spectral templates to
detect CO at S/N = 7.9 ($v_{sys}=0.15^{+0.64}_{-0.65}$ km/s,
$K_{p}=229.5^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ km/s). Moreover, using
cross-correlation-to-log-likelihood mapping, we find that the scaling parameter
which controls the spectral line contrast changes with phase. We thus use the
general circulation model SPARC/MITgcm post-processed by the 3D gCMCRT
radiative transfer code to interpret this variation, finding it consistent with
an eastward-shifted hot spot. Pre-eclipse, when the hot spot faces Earth, the
thermal profiles are shallower leading to smaller line contrast despite greater
overall flux. Post-eclipse, the western part of the day-side faces Earth and
has much steeper thermal profiles, leading to larger line contrast despite less
overall flux. This demonstrates that within the log-likelihood framework, even
relatively moderate resolution spectra can be used to understand the 3D nature
of close-in exoplanets, and that resolution can be traded for photon-collecting
power when the induced Doppler-shift is sufficiently large. We highlight CO as
a good probe of UHJ thermal structure and dynamics that does not suffer from
stellar activity, unlike species that are also present in the host star e.g.
iron lines.

pose-related representation is used to learn the relative pose wrt a ""latent

the rigid transformation is obtained from the above two learned relative poses.
Our method not only filters out the disturbance in pose-invariant

strategy is to estimate the relative pose based only on some accurate
correspondences, which is achieved by building correspondences on the

usually complicated and time-consuming. By contrast, the virtual point-based
methods learn the virtual corresponding points (VCPs) for all source points
uniformly without distinguishing the outliers and the inliers. Although this
strategy is time-efficient, the learned VCPs usually exhibit serious collapse
degeneration due to insufficient supervision and the inherent distribution
limitation. In this paper, we propose to exploit the best of both worlds and

idea of the virtual point-based methods but learn a new type of virtual points
called rectified virtual corresponding points (RCPs), which are defined as the
point set with the same shape as the source and with the same pose as the
target. Hence, a pair of consistent point clouds, i.e. source and RCPs, is
formed by rectifying VCPs to RCPs (VRNet), through which reliable
correspondences between source and RCPs can be accurately obtained. Since the
relative pose between source and RCPs is the same as the relative pose between
source and target, the input point clouds can be registered naturally.
Specifically, we first construct the initial VCPs by using an estimated soft
matching matrix to perform a weighted average on the target points. Then, we
design a correction-walk module to learn an offset to rectify VCPs to RCPs,
which effectively breaks the distribution limitation of VCPs. Finally, we
develop a hybrid loss function to enforce the shape and geometry structure

arguments, we show that subsystem symmetry fractionalization is not possible in
many cases due to the additional rigid geometric structure of the symmetries.
However, we identify a new mechanism that allows fractionalization, involving
global relations between macroscopically many symmetry generators. We find that
anyons can fractionalize such relations, meaning that the total charge carried
under all generators involved in the global relation is non-trivial, despite
the fact that these generators multiply to the identity. We first discuss the
general algebraic framework needed to characterize this new type of
fractionalization, and then explore this framework using a number of exactly
solvable models with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order, including models having
line and fractal symmetries. These models all showcase another necessary
property of subsystem symmetry fractionalization: fractionalized anyons must
have restricted mobility when the symmetry is enforced, such that they are
confined to a single line or point in the case of line and fractal symmetries,
respectively. Looking forward, we expect that our identification of the
importance of global relations in fractionalization will hold significance for
the classification of phases with subsystem symmetries in all dimensions.

phase of gravitational waves (GWs) during their propagation. As detector
sensitivities increase, it becomes key to understand how these modifications
affect the GW higher modes and to disentangle possible degeneracies with
astrophysical phenomena. We apply a general formalism -- the WKB approach --
for solving analytically wave propagation in the spatial domain with a modified
dispersion relation (MDR). We compare this WKB approach to applying a
stationary phase approximation (SPA) in the temporal domain with time delays
associated to the group or particle velocity. To this end, we extend the SPA to
generic signals with higher modes, keeping careful track of reference phases
and arrival times. We find that the WKB approach coincides with the SPA using
the group velocity, in agreement with the principles of wave propagation. We
then explore the degeneracies between a GW propagation with an MDR and a
strongly-lensed GW in GR, since the latter can introduce a
frequency-independent phase shift which is not degenerate with source
parameters in the presence of higher modes. We find that for a particular MDR
there is an exact degeneracy for wave propagation, unlike with the SPA for
particle propagation. For the other cases, we search for the values of the MDR
parameters that minimize the $\chi^2$ and conclude that strongly-lensed GR GWs
could be misinterpreted as GWs in modified gravity. Future MDR constraints with
higher mode GWs should include the possibility of frequency-independent phase
shifts, allowing for the identification of modified gravity and strong lensing

Furthermore, synthetic power networks based on the random growth model grow up

which are traditionally obtained from numerical models, precipitation
nowcasting needs to be very fast. It is therefore more challenging to obtain
because of this time constraint. Recently, many machine learning based methods
had been proposed. We propose the use three popular deep learning models
(U-net, ConvLSTM and SVG-LP) trained on two-dimensional precipitation maps for
precipitation nowcasting. We proposed an algorithm for patch extraction to
obtain high resolution precipitation maps. We proposed a loss function to solve
the blurry image issue and to reduce the influence of zero value pixels in

Compton-thin torus covering factor $C_{22}$ obtained from the XClumpy model is

characterising potential blazar counterparts to high-energy neutrinos, we
analysed the parsec-scale regions of gamma-ray blazars in spatial coincidence
with neutrinos detected by IceCube. Specifically, we intended to investigate
peculiar radio properties of the candidate counterparts related to neutrino
production, as radio flares coincident to the neutrino detection or features in
jets morphology (limb brightening, transverse structures). Methods. We
collected multi-frequency VLBI follow-up observations of candidate counterparts
of four high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube between January 2019
and November 2020. We analysed their radio characteristics soon after the
neutrino arrival in comparison with archival VLBI observations and
low-frequency radio observations. We discussed our results with respect to
previous statistical works and studies on the case of TXS 0506+056. Results. We
identified and analysed in detail five potential neutrino emitting blazars. Our
results suggest an enhanced state of radio activity for one source,
PKS1725+123. However, the lack of adequate monitoring prior to the neutrino
events was a limitation in tracing radio activity and morphological changes in
all the sources. Conclusions. We suggest that PKS1725+123 is a promising
neutrino source candidate. For the other four sources, our results alone do not
allow us to reveal a strong connection between the radio activity state at

due to smallness of the couplings involved. However, a non-standard
cosmological history of the Universe, prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN),
can dramatically change this scenario. In this context, we study the freeze-in
production of dark matter in classically scale invariant $U(1)_X$ gauge
extension of the Standard Model (SM), recently dubbed as the \textit{Scale
Invariant FIMP Miracle}. We assume an additional species dominates the energy
density of the Universe at early times, causing the expansion rate at a given
temperature to be larger than that in the standard radiation-dominated case. We
find, the \textit{out-of-equilibrium} scattering processes involving particles
in the thermal bath lead to significantly suppressed DM production in this era,
thereby enhancing the couplings between the visible and the dark sector (by
several orders of magnitude) to satisfy the observed DM abundance, and
improving the detection prospects for freeze-in in turn. Scale invariance of
the underlying theory leaves only four free parameters in the model: the DM
mass $m_X$, the gauge coupling $g_X$, the temperature of transition $T_R$ from
early scalar-dominated to radiation-dominated era and the power-law dependence
$n$ of this temperature. We show, within this minimal set-up, experiments like
FASER, MATHUSLA, DUNE, SHiP will be probing various cosmological models
depending on the choice of $\{n,\,T_R\}$ that also satisfy the PLANCK observed
relic density bound. Moreover, due to the presence of a naturally light scalar
mediator, the direct detection of the DM at XENON1T, PandaX-4T or XENONnT
becomes relevant for Higgs-scalar mixing $\sin\theta\simeq\{10^{-5}-10^{-3}\}$,
thus providing complementary probes for freeze-in, as well as for non-standard
cosmological pre-BBN era.

how to best apply foundation models without labeled data. A potential approach
is to fuse foundation models with weak supervision frameworks, which use weak
label sources -- pre-trained models, heuristics, crowd-workers -- to construct
pseudolabels. The challenge is building a combination that best exploits the
signal available in both foundation models and weak sources. We propose Liger,
a combination that uses foundation model embeddings to improve two crucial
elements of existing weak supervision techniques. First, we produce finer
estimates of weak source quality by partitioning the embedding space and
learning per-part source accuracies. Second, we improve source coverage by
extending source votes in embedding space. Despite the black-box nature of
foundation models, we prove results characterizing how our approach improves
performance and show that lift scales with the smoothness of label
distributions in embedding space. On six benchmark NLP and video tasks, Liger
outperforms vanilla weak supervision by 14.1 points, weakly-supervised kNN and
adapters by 11.8 points, and kNN and adapters supervised by traditional hand
labels by 7.2 points.

interplay of topology and geometry, fracton (topological) orders feature
subextensive topological ground state degeneracy and subdimensional excitations
that are movable only within a certain subspace. It has been known in the
exactly solvable three-dimensional X-cube model that universally represents the
type-I fracton orders, that mobility constraints on subdimensional excitations
originate from the absence of spatially deformable string-like operators. To
unveil the interplay of topology and geometry, in this paper, we study the
dynamical signature in the X-cube model in the presence of external Zeeman
fields via large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation and stochastic analytic
continuation. We compute both real-space correlation functions and dynamic
structure factors of subdimensional excitations (i.e., fractons, lineons, and
planons) in the fracton phase and their evolution into the trivial paramagnetic
phase by increasing external fields. We find in the fracton phase, that the
correlation functions and the spectral functions show clear anisotropy exactly
caused by the underlying mobility constraints. On the other hand, the external
fields successfully induce quantum fluctuations and offer mobility to
excitations along the subspace allowed by mobility constraints. These numerical
results provide the evolution of a dynamical signature of subdimensional
particles in fracton orders, indicating that the mobility constraints on local
dynamical properties of subdimensional excitations are deeply related to the
existence of fracton topological order. The results will also be helpful in
potential experimental identifications in spectroscopy measurements such as
neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance.

ultraviolet line indices (e.g. at 1719 and 1853\r{A}) and optical line indices
(such as MgB) are sensitive to such changes in composition for a continuously
star-forming population and a single starburst population respectively. We find
that at ages of more than 1Gyr, $\alpha$-enhanced stellar populations appear
bluer than their Solar-scaled counterparts, and show expected sensitivity of
optical line indices to composition, in agreement with previous work. The
ultraviolet stellar absorption lines are relatively insensitive to subtleties

relation of gamma-ray pulsars using 190 pulsars included in the latest 4FGL-DR3
catalog. This sample number is more than twice as large as that of the original
study. The FP relation incorporates 4 parameters, i.e., the spin-down power,
$\dot{\mathcal{E}}$, the surface magnetic field, $B_{\star}$, the total
gamma-ray luminosity, $L_{\gamma}$, and a spectral cutoff energy,
$\epsilon_{\rm cut}$. The derivation of $\epsilon_{\rm cut}$ is the most
intriguing one because $\epsilon_{\rm cut}$ depends on the proper
interpretation of the available phase-averaged spectra. We construct synthetic
phase-averaged spectra, guided by the few existing phase-resolved ones, to find
that the best fit cutoff energy, $\epsilon_{\rm c1}$, corresponding to a purely
exponential cutoff (plus a power law) spectral form, is the parameter that
optimally probes the maximum cutoff energy of the emission that originates from
the core of the dissipative region, i.e., the equatorial current sheet.
Computing this parameter for the 190 4FGL pulsars, we find that the resulting
FP relation, i.e. the gamma-ray luminosity in terms of the other observables,
reads $L_{\gamma}=10^{14.3\pm 1.3}(\epsilon_{\rm c1}/{\rm
MeV})^{1.39\pm0.17}(B_{\star}/{\rm G})^{0.12\pm 0.03}(\dot{\mathcal{E}}/{\rm

both the empirical relation reported by Kalapotharakos et al. (2019) and the
theoretically predicted relation for curvature radiation. Finally, we revisit
the radiation reaction limited condition, to find it is a sufficient but not
necessary condition for the theoretical derivation of the FP relation. However,
the assumption of the radiation reaction limited acceleration reveals the
underlying accelerating electric field component and its scaling with
$\dot{\mathcal{E}}$.

propose a swin-conv block to incorporate the local modeling ability of residual
convolutional layer and non-local modeling ability of swin transformer block,
and then plug it as the main building block into the widely-used image-to-image
translation UNet architecture. For the training data synthesis, we design a
practical noise degradation model which takes into consideration different
kinds of noise (including Gaussian, Poisson, speckle, JPEG compression, and
processed camera sensor noises) and resizing, and also involves a random
shuffle strategy and a double degradation strategy. Extensive experiments on
AGWN removal and real image denoising demonstrate that the new network
architecture design achieves state-of-the-art performance and the new
degradation model can help to significantly improve the practicability. We
believe our work can provide useful insights into current denoising research.

a result of the scattering of phonons with a wide range of mean-free-paths
(MFPs). In these materials, long-MFP phonons are scattered at the nanoscale
boundaries whereas short-MFP high-frequency phonons are impeded by disordered
point defects introduced by alloying. While this trend has been validated by
simplified analytical and numerical methods, an ab-initio space-resolved
approach remains elusive. To fill this gap, we calculate the thermal
conductivity reduction in porous alloys by solving the mode-resolved Boltzmann
transport equation for phonons using the finite-volume approach. We analyze
different alloys, length-scales, concentrations, and temperatures, obtaining a
very large reduction in the thermal conductivity over the entire configuration
space. For example, a ~97% reduction is found for Al$_{0.8}$In$_{0.2}$As with
25% porosity. Furthermore, we employ these simulations to validate our recently
introduced ""Ballistic Correction Model"" (BCM), an approach that estimates the
effective thermal conductivity using the characteristic MFP of the bulk alloy
and the length-scale of the material. The BCM is then used to provide guiding
principles in designing alloy-based nanostructures. Notably, it elucidates how
porous alloys such as Si$_{x}$Ge$_{1-x}$ obtain larger thermal conductivity
reduction compared to porous Si or Ge, while also explaining why we should not
expect similar behavior in alloys such as Al$_{x}$In$_{1-x}$As. By taking into
account the synergy from scattering at different scales, we provide a route for
the design of materials with ultra-low thermal conductivity.

interstellar environment and its changing influence on the heliosphere. The
size, shape, and physical properties of the heliosphere outside of the
heliopause are determined by the surrounding environment - now the outer region
of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC). Analysis of high-resolution HST spectra
led to a kinematic model with many interstellar clouds. This analysis
identified fifteen clouds located within about 10 pc of the Sun and their mean
temperatures, turbulence, and velocity vectors. With the increasing number of
sight lines now being analyzed, we find that temperatures and turbulent
velocities have spatial variations within the LIC and other nearby clouds much
larger than measurement uncertainties, and that these spatial variations appear
to be randomly distributed and can be fit by Gaussians. The inhomogeneous
length scale is less than 4,000 AU, a distance that the heliosphere will
traverse in less than 600 years. The temperatures and turbulent velocities do
not show significant trends with stellar distance or angle from the LIC center.
If/when the Sun enters an inter-cloud medium, the physical properties of the
future heliosphere will be very different from the present. For the heliosheath
and the very local interstellar medium (VLISM) just outside of the heliopause,
the total pressures are approximately equal to the gravitational pressure of
overlying material in the Galaxy. The internal pressure in the LIC is far below
that in the VLISM, but there is an uncertain ram pressure term produced by the
flow of the LIC with respect to its environment.

various applications in video editing, summarization, and recommendation. Prior
work has typically addressed this task by predicting genres based solely on the
visual content. As a result, predictions from these methods often perform
poorly for genres such as documentary or musical, since non-visual modalities

genres. In addition, the analysis of long videos at frame level is always
associated with high computational cost and makes the prediction less

leveraging shot information, MMShot, to classify video genres in an efficient
and effective way. We evaluate our method on MovieNet and Condensed Movies for
genre classification, achieving 17% ~ 21% improvement on mean Average Precision
(mAP) over the state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the ability of MMShot for long video analysis and uncover the

make analysis more accessible, we designed the so-called Analysis Description
Language (ADL), a domain specific language capable of describing the contents
of an LHC analysis in a standard and unambiguous way, independent of any
computing frameworks. ADL has an English-like highly human-readable syntax and
directly employs concepts relevant to HEP. Therefore it eliminates the need to
learn complex analysis frameworks written based on general purpose languages
such as C++ or Python, and shifts the focus directly to physics. Analyses
written in ADL can be run on data using a runtime interpreter called CutLang,
without the necessity of programming. ADL and CutLang are designed for use by
anyone with an interest in, and/or knowledge of LHC physics, ranging from
experimentalists and phenomenologists to non-professional enthusiasts.
ADL/CutLang are originally designed for research, but are also equally intended
for education and public use. This approach has already been employed to train
undergraduate students with no programming experience in LHC analysis in two
dedicated schools in Turkey and Vietnam, and is being adapted for use with LHC
Open Data. Moreover, work is in progress towards piloting an educational module

Distinct from other continual learning settings the learner is presented new

successful methods in this setting focus on storing and replaying a subset of
samples alongside incoming data in a computationally efficient manner. One
recent proposal ER-AML achieved strong performance in this setting by applying
an asymmetric loss based on contrastive learning to the incoming data and

contrasts between incoming data and stored data, which makes it impractical for
the setting where only one new class is introduced in each phase of the stream.

self-supervised learning to the supervised learning setting, unlocking the

creating and querying maps made of anchor points that enable the overlay of

discusses how we can provide access controls over virtual maps as a basic
building block to enhance security and privacy of AR systems. In particular, we
propose VACMaps: an access control system for localization and mapping using
formal methods. VACMaps defines a domain-specific language that enables users
to specify access control policies for virtual spaces. Access requests to
virtual spaces are then evaluated against relevant policies in a way that
preserves confidentiality and integrity of virtual spaces owned by the users.
The precise semantics of the policies are defined by SMT formulas, which allow
VACMaps to reason about properties of access policies automatically. An
evaluation of VACMaps is provided using an AR testbed of a single-family home.
We show that VACMaps is scalable in that it can run at practical speeds and
that it can also reason about access control policies automatically to detect
potential policy misconfigurations.

driving, which requires to decode 3D predictions solely from a single 2D image.
Most existing methods follow conventional 2D object detectors to localize
objects based on their centers, and predict 3D attributes by neighboring
features around the centers. However, only using local features is insufficient
to understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignore the inter-object
depth relations from contextual cues. In this paper, we introduce a novel
framework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named
MonoDETR. The vanilla transformer is modified to be depth-aware and the whole
detection process is then guided by depth. Specifically, we represent 3D object
candidates as a set of queries and adopt an attention-based depth encoder to
produce non-local depth embeddings of the input image. Then, we propose a
depth-guided decoder with depth cross-attention modules to conduct both
inter-query and query-scene depth feature interactions. In this way, each
object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided
regions from the image and is no longer constrained to use only neighboring
visual features. MonoDETR is an end-to-end network without extra data or NMS
post-processing and achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI benchmark
with significant gains. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and its potential to serve as a transformer
baseline for future monocular 3D object detection research. Code is available

+34 (+14 -33) minutes at 99% confidence. The uncertainty in this lag is
dominated by the fact that we did not observe the peak of the submm emission. A
synchrotron source cooled through adiabatic expansion can describe a rise in
the submm once the synchrotron-self-Compton NIR and X-ray peaks have faded.
This model predicts high GHz and THz fluxes at the time of the NIR/X-ray peak
and electron densities well above those implied from average accretion rates

would be in agreement with the idea that 2019 was an extraordinary epoch with a
heightened accretion rate. Since the NIR and X-ray peaks can also be fit by a
non-thermal synchrotron source with lower electron densities, we cannot rule
out an unrelated chance coincidence of this bright submm flare with the

over-smoothed contour and tend to fail on corner areas. In this paper, we
propose an efficient contour-based boundary refinement approach, named
SharpContour, to tackle the segmentation of boundary area. We design a novel
contour evolution process together with an Instance-aware Point Classifier. Our
method deforms the contour iteratively by updating offsets in a discrete
manner. Differing from existing contour evolution methods, SharpContour
estimates each offset more independently so that it predicts much sharper and

histories but recent work has rekindled interest based on advances in early

analog for earthquakes and the seismic cycle. Labquakes are ideal targets for
machine learning (ML) because they can be produced in long sequences under
controlled conditions. Recent works show that ML can predict several aspects of
labquakes using fault zone acoustic emissions. Here, we generalize these
results and explore deep learning (DL) methods for labquake prediction and
autoregressive (AR) forecasting. DL improves existing ML methods of labquake
prediction. AR methods allow forecasting at future horizons via iterative
predictions. We demonstrate that DL models based on Long-Short Term Memory
(LSTM) and Convolution Neural Networks predict labquakes under several
conditions, and that fault zone stress can be predicted with fidelity,
confirming that acoustic energy is a fingerprint of fault zone stress. We
predict also time to start of failure (TTsF) and time to the end of Failure
(TTeF) for labquakes. Interestingly, TTeF is successfully predicted in all
seismic cycles, while the TTsF prediction varies with the amount of preseismic
fault creep. We report AR methods to forecast the evolution of fault stress
using three sequence modeling frameworks: LSTM, Temporal Convolution Network
and Transformer Network. AR forecasting is distinct from existing predictive
models, which predict only a target variable at a specific time. The results
for forecasting beyond a single seismic cycle are limited but encouraging. Our
ML/DL models outperform the state-of-the-art and our autoregressive model
represents a novel framework that could enhance current methods of earthquake

using impact parameter dependent colour dipole models with and without
saturation. This is the first study of the leading neutron process deploying
these models. The model predictions are compared with the available HERA
measurements for $6<Q^2<100$~GeV$^2$, $70<W<245$~GeV. Our analysis shows that
the models exhibit Feynman scaling, independent of $Q^2$. Our results
demonstrate that the $W$ and $Q^2$ dependence of the cross section is
independent of the presence of a forward neutron as predicted by the limiting
fragmentation hypothesis, which is a consequence of Feynman scaling itself. We
infer that the HERA leading neutron production inclusive data is insensitive to
saturation physics and these cross sections may not be able to distinguish
gluon saturation effects in future $ep$ colliders. We provide a good
description of the leading neutron structure function $F_2^{LN}$ at small $x$
using an assumption that the small-$x$ structure of protons and pions is
universal up to a normalisation. We also show that the observables in the

inclinations compared to those with planets located farther from their host
stars. This could be explained due to precession caused by stellar oblateness
at early times when the host star was rapidly spinning. However, stellar
oblateness reduces over time due to the decrease in the stellar rotation rate,
and this may further shape the planetary mutual inclinations. In this work, we
investigate in detail how the final mutual inclination varies under the effect
of a decreasing $J_2$. We find that different initial parameters (e.g., the
magnitude of $J_2$ and planetary inclinations) will contribute to different
final mutual inclinations, providing a constraint on the formation mechanisms
of USPs. In general, if the inner planets start in the same plane as the
stellar equator (or co-planar while misaligned with the stellar spin-axis), the
mutual inclination decreases (or increases then decreases) over time due to the
decay of the $J_2$ moment. This is because the inner orbit typically possesses
less orbital angular momentum than the outer ones. However, if the outer planet
is initially aligned with the stellar spin while the inner one is misaligned,
the mutual inclination nearly stays the same. Overall, our results suggest that
either the USP planets formed early and acquired significant inclinations
(e.g., $\gtrsim30^\circ$ with its companion or $\gtrsim10^\circ$ with its host
star spin-axis for Kepler-653c) or they formed late ($\gtrsim$Gyr) when their
host stars rotate slower.

at purifying materials that may host QSLs. However, in geometrically frustrated
(GF) magnets, the largest class of materials in which QSLs are sought, the
glass-transition temperature $T_g$ grows with decreasing the density of vacancy
defects, accompanied by a simultaneous growth of the magnetic susceptibility.
In this paper, we develop a phenomenological theory of glass transitions and
magnetic susceptibility in 3D geometrically frustrated (GF) magnetic materials.
We consider a model of a GF magnet in which the glass transition occurs in the
absence of vacancies, e.g., due to other types of quenched disorder. We show
that disorder that creates weak local perturbations, e.g. weak random strain,
leads to the growth of the transition temperature $T_g$. By contrast, vacancies
reduce $T_g$ for small vacancy concentrations. Another consequence of the
presence of vacancies is the creation of quasispins, effective magnetic moments
localised near the vacancies, that contribute to the magnetic susceptibility of
the system together with the bulk spins. We show that increasing the vacancy
density leads to an increase of the total magnetic susceptibility.

lower-order statistics like the power spectrum. We find that the bicoherence, a
related statistic which measures phase coupling of Fourier modes, identifies
turbulence driving scales using density and column density fields. In
particular, it shows that the driving scale is phase-coupled to scales present
in the turbulent cascade. We also find that the presence of an ordered magnetic
field at large-scales enhances phase coupling as compared to a pure
hydrodynamic case. We therefore suggest the bispectrum and bicoherence as tools
for searching for non-locality for wave interactions in MHD turbulence.

been showed multilevel memory capability, but demonstrations still yield
relatively high optical loss and require cumbersome WRITE-ERASE approaches
increasing power consumption and system package challenges. Here we demonstrate
a multi-state electrically-programmed low-loss non-volatile photonic memory

ultra-low absorption in the amorphous state. A zero-static-power and
electrically-programmed multi-bit P-RAM is demonstrated on a
silicon-on-insulator platform, featuring efficient amplitude modulation up to
0.2 dB/{\mu}m and an ultra-low insertion loss of total 0.12 dB for a 4-bit
memory showing a 100x improved signal to loss ratio compared to other
phase-change-materials based photonic memories. We further optimize the
positioning of dual micro-heaters validating performance tradeoffs.
Experimentally we demonstrate a half-a million cyclability test showcasing the

the quenched topological structure keeps a macroscopic fraction of monomers off
the surface, in contrast with annealed models that asymptotically have 100% of

pay special attention to the class of comb polymers, which admit some rigorous
answers to questions that otherwise remain open. Since the class of all combs

aim is to determine whether these heating models are consistent with ICM
observables and if one is preferred over the other. We assume an initial
entropy profile of ICM that is expected from the purely gravitational infall of
the gas in the potential of the dark matter halo. We then incorporate heating,
radiative cooling, and thermal conduction to study the evolution of ICM over
the age of the clusters. Our results are: (i) Both the heating processes can
produce comparable thermal profiles of the ICM with some tuning of relevant
parameters. (ii) Thermal conduction is crucially important, even at the level
of 10\% of the Spitzer values, in transferring the injected energy beyond the
central regions, and without which the temperature/entropy profiles are
unrealistically high. (iii) The required injected AGN power scales with cluster
mass as $M_{\rm vir}^{1.5}$ for both models. (iv) The required AGN luminosity
is comparable with the observed radio jet power, reinforcing the idea that AGNs

epidemic spreads as a front and the epidemic curves are less sensitive to

shaped by perceptual grounding and communicative intent. Computational
approaches to emergent communication (EC) predominantly consider referential
games in limited domains and analyze the learned protocol within the game
framework. As a result, it remains unclear how the emergent languages from
these settings connect to natural languages or provide benefits in real-world
language processing tasks, where statistical models trained on large text
corpora dominate. In this work, we propose a novel way to establish such a link
by corpus transfer, i.e. pretraining on a corpus of emergent language for
downstream natural language tasks, which is in contrast to prior work that
directly transfers speaker and listener parameters. Our approach showcases
non-trivial transfer benefits for two different tasks -- language modeling and
image captioning. For example, in a low-resource setup (modeling 2 million
natural language tokens), pre-training on an emergent language corpus with just
2 million tokens reduces model perplexity by $24.6\%$ on average across ten
natural languages. We also introduce a novel metric to predict the
transferability of an emergent language by translating emergent messages to
natural language captions grounded on the same images. We find that our
translation-based metric highly correlates with the downstream performance on
modeling natural languages (for instance $\rho=0.83$ on Hebrew), while
topographic similarity, a popular metric in previous work, shows surprisingly
low correlation ($\rho=0.003$), hinting that simple properties like attribute
disentanglement from synthetic domains might not capture the full complexities
of natural language. Our findings also indicate potential benefits of moving
language emergence forward with natural language resources and models.

predictions. Genetic programming (GP) is often cited as being uniquely
well-suited to contribute to XAI because of its capacity to learn (small)
symbolic models that have the potential to be interpreted. Nevertheless, like
many ML algorithms, GP typically results in a single best model. However, in
practice, the best model in terms of training error may well not be the most
suitable one as judged by a domain expert for various reasons, including
overfitting, multiple different models existing that have similar accuracy, and
unwanted errors on particular data points due to typical accuracy measures like
mean squared error. Hence, to increase chances that domain experts deem a
resulting model plausible, it becomes important to be able to explicitly search
for multiple, diverse, high-quality models that trade-off different meanings of
accuracy. In this paper, we achieve exactly this with a novel multi-modal
multi-tree multi-objective GP approach that extends a modern model-based GP
algorithm known as GP-GOMEA that is already effective at searching for small

top-down methods have difficulties in recovering accurate 3D human meshes under

bandwidth-controlled Mott transition, as enabled by isovalent Se chemical
substitution on the S sites. Motivated by advances in electrolyte gating, we
theoretically investigate the filling-controlled Mott transition induced by
gating, which has the advantage of avoiding dopant disorder and stoichiometric
changes. We use combined Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Dynamical Mean
Field Theory (DMFT) to study such a filling-controlled transition and compare
it with the case of bandwidth control. We draw a temperature-filling phase
diagram and find that the Mott-insulator to metal transition occurs with modest
added electron concentrations, well within the capabilities of existing
electrolyte gating experiments. We find that there is significant incoherent
weight at the Fermi level in the metallic phase when the transition is induced
by gating. In contrast, the spectral weight remains rather coherent in the case
of the bandwidth-controlled transition.

heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Even still, estimation of HTEs is a
difficult task -- these methods frequently over- or under-estimate the
treatment effects, leading to poor calibration of the resulting models.
However, while many methods exist for evaluating the calibration of prediction
and classification models, formal approaches to assess the calibration of HTE
models are limited to the calibration slope. In this paper, we define an
analogue of the \smash{($\ell_2$)} expected calibration error for HTEs, and
propose a robust estimator. Our approach is motivated by doubly robust
treatment effect estimators, making it unbiased, and resilient to confounding,
overfitting, and high-dimensionality issues. Furthermore, our method is
straightforward to adapt to many structures under which treatment effects can
be identified, including randomized trials, observational studies, and survival
analysis. We illustrate how to use our proposed metric to evaluate the
calibration of learned HTE models through the application to the CRITEO-UPLIFT

hydrodynamic model for SN1987A. As a pre-supernova model, we take an updated
model adjusted to explain the SN1987A employing recent development of the
$(n,\gamma)$ reaction rates for nuclei near the stability line $(A \sim 100)$.
As for the neutrino luminosity, we adopt two different models: equivalent
neutrino luminosity and non-equivalent luminosity models. The latter is taken
from the synthetic analyses of the CCSN simulation data which involved
quantitatively the results obtained by various neutrino transport models.
Relevant neutrino-induced reaction rates are calculated by a shell model for
light nuclei and a quasi-particle random phase approximation model for heavy
nuclei. For each model, we present abundances of the light nuclei ($^7$Li,
$^7$Be, $^{11}$B and $^{11}$C) and heavy nuclei ($^{92}$Nb, $^{98}$Tc,
$^{138}$La and $^{180}$Ta) produced by the neutrino-process. The light nuclei
abundances turn out to be sensitive to the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW)
region around O-Ne-Mg region while the heavy nuclei are mainly produced prior
to the MSW region. Through the detailed analyses, we find that neutrino
self-interaction becomes a key ingredient in addition to the MSW effect for
understanding the neutrino-process and the relevant nuclear abundances. The
normal mass hierarchy is shown to be more compatible with the meteorite data.
Main nuclear reactions for each nucleus are also investigated in detail.

task-specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to
transfer the learned knowledge and representations from one task to another,
thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation
approaches, e.g., a sequential recommendation model can hardly be applied or
transferred to a review generation method. To deal with such issues,
considering that language can describe almost anything and language grounding
is a powerful medium to represent various problems or tasks, we present a
flexible and unified text-to-text paradigm called ""Pretrain, Personalized
Prompt, and Predict Paradigm"" (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various
recommendation tasks in a shared framework. In P5, all data such as user-item
interactions, user descriptions, item metadata, and user reviews are converted
to a common format -- natural language sequences. The rich information from
natural language assists P5 to capture deeper semantics for personalization and
recommendation. Specifically, P5 learns different tasks with the same language
modeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it serves as the foundation model
for various downstream recommendation tasks, allows easy integration with other
modalities, and enables instruction-based recommendation based on prompts. P5
advances recommender systems from shallow model to deep model to big model, and
will revolutionize the technical form of recommender systems towards universal
recommendation engine. With adaptive personalized prompt for different users,
P5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or few-shot manner and largely
reduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. On several recommendation
benchmarks, we conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of P5. We release
the source code at https://github.com/jeykigung/P5.

non-intrusive operator inference ROM framework to exploit the translational

Traditional closed-loop modeling workflows in this context involve the repeated
application of data assimilation/history matching and robust optimization
steps. Data assimilation can be particularly challenging in cases where both
the geological style (scenario) and individual model realizations are
uncertain. The closed-loop reservoir management (CLRM) problem is formulated
here as a partially observable Markov decision process, with the associated
optimization problem solved using a proximal policy optimization algorithm.
This provides a control policy that instantaneously maps flow data observed at
wells (as are available in practice) to optimal well pressure settings. The
policy is represented by a temporal convolution and gated transformer blocks.
Training is performed in a preprocessing step with an ensemble of prior
geological models, which can be drawn from multiple geological scenarios.
Example cases involving the production of oil via water injection, with both 2D
and 3D geological models, are presented. The DRL-based methodology is shown to
result in an NPV increase of 15% (for the 2D cases) and 33% (3D cases) relative
to robust optimization over prior models, and to an average improvement of 4%
in NPV relative to traditional CLRM. The solutions from the control policy are
found to be comparable to those from deterministic optimization, in which the
geological model is assumed to be known, even when multiple geological
scenarios are considered. The control policy approach results in a 76% decrease
in computational cost relative to traditional CLRM with the algorithms and

  This work mainly addresses two problems: (1) What statistic of the sample
should be shared privately? For the first question, i.e., the one about
statistic selection, we promote using the Fisher information. We find out that,
the statistic that is most informative in a non-privacy setting may not be the
optimal choice under the privacy restrictions. We provide several examples to
support that point. We consider several types of data sharing settings and
propose several Monte Carlo-based numerical estimation methods for calculating
the Fisher information for those settings. The second question concerns
inference: (2) Based on the shared statistics, how could we perform effective
Bayesian inference? We propose several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithms for sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameter given
the noisy statistic. The proposed MCMC algorithms can be preferred over one
another depending on the problem. For example, when the shared statistics is
additive and added Gaussian noise, a simple Metropolis-Hasting algorithm that
utilizes the central limit theorem is a decent choice. We propose more advanced
MCMC algorithms for several other cases of practical relevance.
  Our numerical examples involve comparing several candidate statistics to be
shared privately. For each statistic, we perform Bayesian estimation based on
the posterior distribution conditional on the privatized version of that
statistic. We demonstrate that, the relative performance of a statistic, in
terms of the mean squared error of the Bayesian estimator based on the
corresponding privatized statistic, is adequately predicted by the Fisher
information of the privatized statistic.

fluctuations, we find that a peak located at the top of the lower Hubbard band
and one at the bottom of the upper Hubbard band can emerge in the impurity
spectral function. The peaks at the Hubbard band edges arise from the gauge
field fluctuations induced spinon chargon binding inside the spinon Kondo
screening cloud of the magnetic impurity. For a magnetic impurity embedded in a
Mott insulator, our findings suggest that the emergence of a pair of peaks at
the Hubbard band edges in the impurity density of states spectra provides
strong evidence that the host Mott insulator is a U(1) quantum spin liquid with
spinon Fermi surface.

resolution of the $t$-intersection and Erd\H os--S\'os problems for

associated with an abrupt loss of knowledge previously learned by a model when

supervised learning problems this forgetting, resulting from a change in the
model's representation, is typically measured or observed by evaluating the
decrease in old task performance. However, a model's representation can change
without losing knowledge about prior tasks. In this work we consider the
concept of representation forgetting, observed by using the difference in
performance of an optimal linear classifier before and after a new task is
introduced. Using this tool we revisit a number of standard continual learning
benchmarks and observe that, through this lens, model representations trained
without any explicit control for forgetting often experience small
representation forgetting and can sometimes be comparable to methods which
explicitly control for forgetting, especially in longer task sequences. We also
show that representation forgetting can lead to new insights on the effect of
model capacity and loss function used in continual learning. Based on our

of simulations incorporates a different prescription from literature to

Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, questions remain about their ability to
generalize beyond the small reference sets that are publicly available for

novel method by which a Transformer DL model (GPT-2) pre-trained on general
English text is paired with an artificially degraded version of itself (GPT-D),
to compute the ratio between these two models' \textit{perplexities} on
language from cognitively healthy and impaired individuals. This technique
approaches state-of-the-art performance on text data from a widely used ""Cookie

generalizes well to spontaneous conversations. Furthermore, GPT-D generates
text with characteristics known to be associated with AD, demonstrating the
induction of dementia-related linguistic anomalies. Our study is a step toward
better understanding of the relationships between the inner workings of
generative neural language models, the language that they produce, and the
deleterious effects of dementia on human speech and language characteristics.

The data set allows us to study Stokes V profiles of the star at almost
identical rotational phases, separated by one or more stellar rotations. We use
these data to study if the line profiles evolve from one rotation to the next,
and find that some evolution does indeed occur. We consider two possible
explanations for this: abrupt changes in the large-scale magnetic field or
differential rotation. We find it quite difficult to distinguish between the
two alternatives using ZDI alone. A strong differential rotation could,
however, explain the changes in the line profiles, so we conclude that it must
be present, and the abrupt magnetic field evolution is left uncertain.
Commonly, rapidly rotating stars are assumed to have only weak differential
rotation. If the strong differential rotation of V889 Her is indeed present, as
has been found in other studies as well, it could indicate that the theoretical
and numerical results of differential rotation still need to be revised. The
rapid changes that may have occurred in the magnetic field indicate that one
should be quite cautious when interpreting ZDI maps constructed from data over
long time intervals.

central velocity and total flux, the main catalog provides new measures of line
width, profile asymmetry, and profile shape. For a subsample of 13,511 galaxies

non-parametric quantity $K$, measured from the curve-of-growth of the line, to
describe the shape of the integrated H I profile. The value of $K$ increases
from double-horned to single-peaked profiles, depending on projection effects
and the spatial and velocity distribution of the gas. Using carefully chosen
samples to control for the competing factors that influence the integrated line
profile, we argue that useful inferences can be made on the spatial
distribution of the gas. We find that galaxies with a high value of $K$ tend to
have more centrally concentrated H I distribution within the optical disk of
the galaxy at fixed conditions, and that larger values of $K$ are associated
with higher levels of total and central SFR. The results suggest that the
global concentration of H I plays an important role in facilitating the
conversion of neutral atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen gas, which, in
turn, affects the star formation activity throughout the optical disk. Our
sample is biased against quiescent galaxies, and thus the conclusions may not
hold for galaxies with low SFR or low H I content.

higher spin $\chi_{\text{eff}}\approx 0.3$. This discrepancy has been
challenging to resolve as a wide range of differences are employed for each

compute the posterior odds between two different peaks in parameter space. In
doing so, we aim to help resolve disputes about the true nature of
gravitational-wave events associated with conflicting astrophysical
interpretations. Our proposal is not a replacement for standard inference
techniques; instead, our method provides a diagnostic tool to understand
discrepancies between conflicting results. We demonstrate this method by
studying three {$q$-$\chi_{\text{eff}}$} peaks proposed for GW151226. We find
the $(q\sim0.5, \chi_{\text{eff}}\sim0.2)$ interpretation is only slightly
preferred over the $(q\sim0.3, \chi_{\text{eff}}\sim0.3)$ hypothesis with a

multiple radial modes inside the blue-core column, which is consistent with the
experimental observation of coherent high $m$ modes through Bessel function.
The axial profiles of wave field indicate that, once the blue-core mode has
been achieved, waves can only propagate inside the formed column with distinct
phase compared to that outside. The wave energy distribution shows a clear and
sharp boundary at the edge of blue-core column, besides which periodic

reshape existing trajectories for an autonomous agent. We take advantage of
recent advancements in the field of large language models (BERT and CLIP) to
encode the user command, and then combine these features with trajectory
information using multi-modal attention transformers. We train the model using
imitation learning over a dataset containing robot trajectories modified by
language commands, and treat the trajectory generation process as a sequence
prediction problem, analogously to how language generation architectures
operate. We evaluate the system in multiple simulated trajectory scenarios, and
show a significant performance increase of our model over baseline approaches.
In addition, our real-world experiments with a robot arm show that users
significantly prefer our natural language interface over traditional methods
such as kinesthetic teaching or cost-function programming. Our study shows how
the field of robotics can take advantage of large pre-trained language models

a three-stream network to elegantly associate sound source with two augmented

similarities between audio and visual features. Second, we introduce a novel
predictive coding module for audio-visual feature alignment. Such a module
assists SSPL to focus on target objects in a progressive manner and effectively
lowers the positive-pair learning difficulty. Experiments show surprising
results that SSPL outperforms the state-of-the-art approach on two standard

improvements of 8.6% cIoU and 3.4% AUC on SoundNet-Flickr compared to the

in jets and underlying events using the PYTHIA8 event generator. Matching
strange hadrons to the jet area and the underlying event area is expected to
help us disentangle the strange particles produced in hard and soft processes.
The yield and the relative production of strange hadrons dependent on the event
multiplicity are investigated with the color reconnection and color rope
mechanisms implemented in the PYTHIA8 framework. It is found that the inclusive
strange hadron productions can be reasonably described by the color
reconnection and color rope combined effects. A significant multiplicity
dependent enhancement of the strange baryon production in the jet area is
observed induced by the modified string fragmentation mechanisms, indicating
the strange baryon enhancement persists in both the hard and the soft process.
Multi-strange baryons are found to be more collimated with the jet axis than
other strange hadrons in the string fragmentation picture with the jet shape
analysis technique. Future experimental examination of these jet related
strange hadron productions will provide more insight to the origin of
strangeness enhancement in small systems.

utilizing sliced Wasserstein distance in applications. However, finding these

computational issue is even more severe in deep learning applications, where
computing the distance between two mini-batch probability measures is repeated
several times. This nested loop has been one of the main challenges that
prevent the usage of sliced Wasserstein distances based on good projections in
practice. To address this challenge, we propose to utilize the
learning-to-optimize technique or amortized optimization to predict the
informative direction of any given two mini-batch probability measures. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that bridges amortized
optimization and sliced Wasserstein generative models. In particular, we derive
linear amortized models, generalized linear amortized models, and non-linear
amortized models which are corresponding to three types of novel mini-batch
losses, named amortized sliced Wasserstein. We demonstrate the favorable
performance of the proposed sliced losses in deep generative modeling on
standard benchmark datasets.

J0134.2-4258 was fortuitously at one of its lowest X-ray flux states. However,
there is a clear rise above 4 keV which implies that the intrinsic source flux
may be higher. The X-ray spectra observed between 1996 and 2019 show drastic
variability, probably due to complex, variable absorption along the line of
sight. Unusually, the soft X-ray excess appears extremely weak in all these
spectra, even when the hard X-ray spectrum has a steep slope of $\Gamma \simeq
2.2$. We explore the spectral-timing properties of the new (low X-ray flux) and
archival (high X-ray flux) XMM-Newton data, fitting their time-average, rms and
lag spectra simultaneously. The variability spectra indicate the presence of a
very weak soft X-ray Comptonisation component, whose shape is similar to the
soft excess in normal super-Eddington NLS1s, but with flux relative to the
power law which is lower by more than one order of magnitude. Above 4 keV the
low-flux data are dominated by a different component, which lags with respect
to the lower energy emission. This is consistent with an origin of reflection
or partial covering absorption from low ionization material located within 100

the sample complexity for a known graph of possible manipulations in terms of
the complexity of the function class and the manipulation graph. Additionally,

a similarity measure for manipulation graphs and show that learning outcomes

analyse the (sample complexity of) learning of the manipulation capability of
agents with respect to this similarity measure, providing novel guarantees for

traversability based exclusively on robot speed that can be learned from data,
offers interpretability and intuitive tuning, and can be easily integrated with
a variety of planning paradigms in the form of a costmap. Specifically, given a
dataset of experienced trajectories, the proposed algorithm learns to predict a
distribution of speeds the robot could achieve, conditioned on the environment
semantics and commanded speed. The learned speed distribution map is converted
into costmaps with a risk-aware cost term based on conditional value at risk

algorithm leads to faster average time-to-goals compared to a method that only
considers expected behavior, and the planner can be tuned for slightly slower,

current set, and the local operation slides a token along an arc respecting its
direction. Previously, such a problem was extensively studied on undirected
graphs, where the edges have no directions and thus the local operation is
symmetric. \textsc{Directed Token Sliding} is a generalization of its
undirected variant since an undirected edge can be simulated by two arcs of
opposite directions.
  In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study of \textsc{Directed Token
Sliding}. We first observe that the problem is PSPACE-complete even if we
forbid parallel arcs in opposite directions and that the problem on directed
acyclic graphs is NP-complete and W[1]-hard parameterized by the size of the
sets in consideration. We then show our main result: a linear-time algorithm
for the problem on directed graphs whose underlying undirected graphs are
trees, which are called polytrees. Such a result is also known for the
undirected variant of the problem on trees~[Demaine et al.~TCS 2015], but the
techniques used here are quite different because of the asymmetric nature of
the directed problem. We present a characterization of yes-instances based on
the existence of a certain set of directed paths, and then derive simple
equivalent conditions from it by some observations, which admits an efficient
algorithm. For the polytree case, we also present a quadratic-time algorithm
that outputs, if the input is a yes-instance, one of the shortest
reconfiguration sequences.

biggest challenges of VEA is to bridge the affective gap between visual clues
in a picture and the emotion expressed by the picture. As the granularity of
emotions increases, the affective gap increases as well. Existing deep
approaches try to bridge the gap by directly learning discrimination among
emotions globally in one shot without considering the hierarchical relationship
among emotions at different affective levels and the affective level of
emotions to be classified. In this paper, we present the Multi-level Dependent
Attention Network (MDAN) with two branches, to leverage the emotion hierarchy
and the correlation between different affective levels and semantic levels. The
bottom-up branch directly learns emotions at the highest affective level and
strictly follows the emotion hierarchy while predicting emotions at lower
affective levels. In contrast, the top-down branch attempt to disentangle the
affective gap by one-to-one mapping between semantic levels and affective
levels, namely, Affective Semantic Mapping. At each semantic level, a local
classifier learns discrimination among emotions at the corresponding affective
level. Finally, We integrate global learning and local learning into a unified
deep framework and optimize the network simultaneously. Moreover, to properly
extract and leverage channel dependencies and spatial attention while
disentangling the affective gap, we carefully designed two attention modules:
the Multi-head Cross Channel Attention module and the Level-dependent Class
Activation Map module. Finally, the proposed deep framework obtains new
state-of-the-art performance on six VEA benchmarks, where it outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., +3.85% on the WEBEmo

3C employs two novel static analysis algorithms - typ3c and boun3c - to
annotate legacy pointers as checked pointers, and to infer array bounds

direct a human developer to code that should be refactored; once done, 3C can

deterministic linear policies -- policies that deterministically stop based on
the sign of a weighted sum of basis functions -- but are not guaranteed to find
the optimal policy within this policy class given a fixed basis function
architecture. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for optimal stopping
based on randomized linear policies, which choose to stop with a probability

policies by establishing that under mild conditions, given a fixed basis
function architecture, optimizing over randomized linear policies is equivalent
to optimizing over deterministic linear policies. We formulate the problem of
learning randomized linear policies from data as a smooth non-convex sample
average approximation (SAA) problem. We theoretically prove the almost sure
convergence of our randomized policy SAA problem and establish bounds on the
out-of-sample performance of randomized policies obtained from our SAA problem

NP-Hard, and consequently develop a practical heuristic for solving our

features in each layer. Then, relevance analysis between the critical features
and preceding/subsequent parameter layers is adopted to bridge the route
between two adjacent parameter layers. In the assembling phase, class-wise
components of each layer are assembled into a new deep model for a specific
task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the assembled CNN classifier can
achieve close accuracy with the original classifier without any fine-tune, and
excess original performance with one-epoch fine-tune. What's more, we also
conduct massive experiments to verify the broad application of MDA-Task on
model decision route visualization, model compression, knowledge distillation,
transfer learning, incremental learning, and so on.

Notably, our unsupervised adversarial sampling method achieves an Inception

an intricate function of unknown lighting conditions, material properties and

key insight is that polarization is a useful cue for neural inverse rendering

rule-based method starts from a pre-trained object detector and it assigns
scene type, uncertainty and lighting categories to each frame based on
probability distributions of foreground objects. Next, frames with the highest
uncertainty and structural dissimilarity are isolated as key-frames. The second
method relies on the simCLR model for frame encoding followed by
label-spreading from 20% of frame samples to label the remaining frames for
scene and lighting categories. Also, clustering the video frames in the encoded

attributed to possible nitrogen incorporation into grain boundaries and tensile

in films grown below 75% N$_2$ is explained by the prevalence of in-plane
tensile stress generated during coalescence. The tensile stress decreased in

language descriptions. The prevalence of large language models advances the
state-of-the-art for program synthesis, though limited training resources and
data impede open access to such models. To democratize this, we train and
release a family of large language models up to 16.1B parameters, called
CODEGEN, on natural language and programming language data, and open source the
training library JAXFORMER. We show the utility of the trained model by
demonstrating that it is competitive with the previous state-of-the-art on
zero-shot Python code generation on HumanEval. We further investigate the
multi-step paradigm for program synthesis, where a single program is factorized
into multiple prompts specifying subproblems. To this end, we construct an open
benchmark, Multi-Turn Programming Benchmark (MTPB), consisting of 115 diverse
problem sets that are factorized into multi-turn prompts. Our analysis on MTPB
shows that the same intent provided to CODEGEN in multi-turn fashion
significantly improves program synthesis over that provided as a single turn.
We make the training library JAXFORMER and model checkpoints available as open

  Foreign Keys",,,,,"cs.DB cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since 2005, significant progress has been made in the problem of Consistent
Query Answering (CQA) with respect to primary keys. In this problem, the input
is a database instance that may violate one or more primary key constraints. A
repair is defined as a maximal subinstance that satisfies all primary keys.
Given a Boolean query q, the question then is whether q holds true in every
repair.
  So far, theoretical research in this field has not addressed the combination
of primary key and foreign key constraints, despite the importance of
referential integrity in database systems. This paper addresses the problem of
CQA with respect to both primary keys and foreign keys. In this setting, it is
natural to adopt the notion of symmetric-difference repairs, because foreign
keys can be repaired by inserting new tuples.
  We consider the case where foreign keys are unary, and queries are
conjunctive queries without self-joins. In this setting, we characterize the
boundary between those CQA problems that admit a consistent first-order
rewriting, and those that do not.

graph colourings with specific Ramsey properties. The new graphs comprise
mainly 'template graphs' which can be used in a construction described by the
current author in 2021 to build linear or cyclic compound graphs with inherited
Ramsey properties. These graphs result in improved lower bounds for a wide
range of multicolour Ramsey numbers.
  Searches were carried out using relatively simple programs (written in the
language `C') to generate clauses for input to the PeneLoPe and Plingeling
parallel SAT-solvers. When solutions were found, the output from the solvers
specified the desired graph colourings.
  The majority of the graphs produced by this work are `template graphs' with
parameters in the form $(k,k,3)$ or $(k,l,3)$ with $k \ne l$. Using these
template graphs in familiar constructions, it has been possible to demonstrate
significant improvements for lower bounds for most $R_r(k)$ for $5 \le k \le 9$
and $r \ge 4$. These improvements provide correspondingly increased lower
bounds on $\Gamma(k) = \lim_{\substack{r \rightarrow \infty}} R{_r}(k)^{1/r}$.
  We also show that $R_3(8) \ge 7174$ and $R_3(9) \ge 15041$. Other new lower
bounds include $R(3,6,6) \ge 338$ and $R(3,8,8) \ge 941$, based on non-template
cyclic graphs, and the interesting particular cases $R(3,4,5,5) \ge 729$ and
$R(3,5,5,5) \ge 1429$.

Through the Kaluza-Klein reduction, an effective four-dimensional static
spherically symmetric nonsingular black hole can be obtained. In this paper, we
study shadow of this nonsingular black hole using three kinds of observers,
i.e. static observers, surrounding observers, and freely falling observers, in
four-dimensional spacetime. For a spherically symmetric black hole, the shadow
is circular for any observer, but the shadow size depends on the motion status
of the observer. The shadow size observed by a moving observer will tend to be
shrunk. On the other hand, the effect of plasma is also investigated by a
simple model. The radius of the photon sphere depends on the plasma model. Most
importantly, we find that the shadow sizes do not monotonically decrease with r

under the white-box setting, but they usually show poor transferability when
attacking other DNN models. Momentum-based attack is one effective method to
improve transferability. It integrates the momentum term into the iterative
process, which can stabilize the update directions by adding the gradients'
temporal correlation for each pixel. We argue that only this temporal momentum
is not enough, the gradients from the spatial domain within an image, i.e.
gradients from the context pixels centered on the target pixel are also
important to the stabilization. For that, we propose a novel method named
Spatial Momentum Iterative FGSM attack (SMI-FGSM), which introduces the
mechanism of momentum accumulation from temporal domain to spatial domain by
considering the context information from different regions within the image.
SMI-FGSM is then integrated with temporal momentum to simultaneously stabilize
the gradients' update direction from both the temporal and spatial domains.
Extensive experiments show that our method indeed further enhances adversarial
transferability. It achieves the best transferability success rate for multiple
mainstream undefended and defended models, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin of 10\% on average.

four filamentary arms and a NNE--SSW velocity gradient ($\sim$0.4\,km/s/pc)

the hub at the center of the HFS reaching values of 2.5--3\,km\,s$^{-1}$ in the

new and important ethical issues that arise from technological development.
Software developers, designers and managerial decision-makers are ever more
expected to consider ethical values and conduct normative evaluations when
building digital products. Yet, when one looks for guidance in the academic
literature one encounters a plethora of branches of applied ethics. Depending
on the context of the system that is to be developed, interesting subfields
like big data ethics, machine ethics, information ethics, AI ethics or computer
ethics (to only name a few) may present themselves. In this paper we want to
offer assistance to any member of a development team by giving a clear and
brief introduction into two fields of ethical endeavor (normative ethics and
applied ethics), describing how they are related to each other and, finally,
provide an ordering of the different branches of applied ethics (big data
ethics, machine ethics, information ethics, AI ethics or computer ethics etc.)
which have gained traction over the last years. Finally, we discuss an example
in the domain of facial recognition software in the domain of medicine to
illustrate how this process of normative analysis might be conducted.

misused. Training the audio intelligence systems needs these data to build
useful features, but the cost for getting permissions or purchasing data is
very high, which inevitably encourages hackers to collect these voice data
without people's awareness. To discourage the hackers from proactively
collecting people's voice data, we are the first to propose a clean-label
poisoning attack, called WaveFuzz, which can prevent intelligence audio models
from building useful features from protected (poisoned) voice data but still
preserve the semantic information to the humans. Specifically, WaveFuzz
perturbs the voice data to cause Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
(typical representations of audio signals) to generate the poisoned frequency
features. These poisoned features are then fed to audio prediction models,
which degrades the performance of audio intelligence systems. Empirically, we
show the efficacy of WaveFuzz by attacking two representative types of
intelligent audio systems, i.e., speaker recognition system (SR) and speech
command recognition system (SCR). For example, the accuracies of models are
declined by $19.78\%$ when only $10\%$ of the poisoned voice data is to
fine-tune models, and the accuracies of models declined by $6.07\%$ when only
$10\%$ of the training voice data is poisoned. Consequently, WaveFuzz is an
effective technique that enables people to fight back to protect their own
voice data, which sheds new light on ameliorating privacy issues.

tasks, such as the inspection and maintenance of infrastructure. The workload
of ROV operators tends to be high, even for the skilled ones. Therefore,
assistance methods for the operators are desired. This study focuses on a task
in which a human operator controls an underwater robot to follow a certain path
while visually inspecting objects in the vicinity of the path. In such a task,
it is desirable to realize the speed of trajectory control manually because the
visual inspection is performed by a human operator. However, to allocate
resources to visual inspection, it is desirable to minimize the workload on the
path-following by assisting with the automatic control. Therefore, the
objective of this study was to develop a cooperative path-following control
method that achieves the above-mentioned task by expanding a robust
path-following control law of nonholonomic wheeled vehicles. To simplify this
problem, we considered a path-following and visual objects recognition task in
a two-dimensional plane. We conducted an experiment with participants (n=16)
who completed the task using the proposed method and manual control. The
results showed that both the path-following errors and the workload of the
participants were significantly smaller with the proposed method than with
manual control. In addition, subjective responses demonstrated that operator
attention tended to be allocated to objects recognition rather than robot
operation tasks with the proposed method. These results indicate the
effectiveness of the proposed cooperative path-following control method.

has been widely used for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) and
semantic segmentation (WSSS), such classifiers usually focus on discriminative
object regions. In this paper, we propose Contrastive learning for
Class-agnostic Activation Map (C$^2$AM) generation only using unlabeled image
data, without the involvement of image-level supervision. The core idea comes
from the observation that i) semantic information of foreground objects usually
differs from their backgrounds; ii) foreground objects with similar appearance
or background with similar color/texture have similar representations in the
feature space. We form the positive and negative pairs based on the above
relations and force the network to disentangle foreground and background with a
class-agnostic activation map using a novel contrastive loss. As the network is
guided to discriminate cross-image foreground-background, the class-agnostic
activation maps learned by our approach generate more complete object regions.
We successfully extracted from C$^2$AM class-agnostic object bounding boxes for
object localization and background cues to refine CAM generated by
classification network for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on
CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and PASCAL VOC2012 datasets show that both WSOL and

Appropriate modeling and analysis of the angles and distances between
transmitters and receivers in these networks are thus essential to understand
performance and limiting factors. Most existing literature considers either
infinite and uniform networks, where nodes are drawn according to a Poisson
point process, or finite networks with the reference receiver placed at the
origin of a disk. Under either of these assumptions, the distance and azimuth
angle between transmitter and receiver are independent, and the angle follows a
uniform distribution between $0$ and $2\pi$. Here, we consider a more realistic
case of finite networks where the reference node is placed at any arbitrary
location. We obtain the joint distribution between the distance and azimuth
angle and demonstrate that these random variables do exhibit certain
correlation, which depends on the shape of the region and the location of the
reference node. To conduct the analysis, we present a general mathematical
framework which is specialized to exemplify the case of a rectangular region.
We then also derive the statistics for the 3D case where, considering antenna
heights, the joint distribution of distance, azimuth and zenith angles is
obtained. Finally, we describe some immediate applications of the present work,

topologically protected and do not depend on the bulk metric. The 2D action
holographically induced on the boundary depends on two scalar fields, and can
be decoupled in two Luttinger actions describing two chiral bosons moving on
the edge of the 3D bulk. The outcome is that these edge excitations are
accelerated, as a direct consequence of the non-flat nature of the bulk
spacetime. The chiral velocities of the edge modes, indeed, acquire a local
dependence through the determinant of the induced metric on the boundary. We
find three possibilities for the motion of the edge quasiparticles: same
directions, opposite directions and a single-moving mode. But, requiring that
the Hamiltonian of the 2D theory is bounded by below, the case of edge modes
moving in the same direction is ruled out: systems involving parallel Hall
currents (for instance Fractional Quantum Hall Effect with $\nu=2/5$) cannot be
described by a BF theory with boundary, independently from the geometry of the
bulk spacetime, because of positive energy considerations. We are therefore
left with physical situations characterized by edge excitations moving with
opposite velocities (examples are FQHE with $\nu=1-1/n$, with $n$ positive
integer, and Helical Luttinger Liquids phenomena) or a single-moving mode
(Quantum Anomalous Hall). A strong restriction is obtained by requiring Time
Reversal symmetry, which uniquely identifies modes with equal and opposite
velocities, and we know that this is the case of Topological Insulators. The
novelty, with respect to the flat bulk background, is that the modes have local

quantum entropies and distances, including the von Neumann entropy, quantum
R\'{e}nyi entropy, trace distance, and fidelity. The proposed algorithms
significantly outperform the best known (and even quantum) ones in the low-rank
case, some of which achieve exponential speedups. In particular, for
$N$-dimensional quantum states of rank $r$, our proposed quantum algorithms for
computing the von Neumann entropy, trace distance and fidelity within additive
error $\varepsilon$ have time complexity of $\tilde O(r^2/\varepsilon^2)$,
$\tilde O(r^5/\varepsilon^6)$ and $\tilde O(r^{6.5}/\varepsilon^{7.5})$,
respectively. In contrast, the known algorithms for the von Neumann entropy and
trace distance require quantum time complexity of $\Omega(N)$
[AISW19,GL20,GHS21], and the best known one for fidelity requires $\tilde
O(r^{21.5}/\varepsilon^{23.5})$ [WZC+21].
  The key idea of our quantum algorithms is to extend block-encoding from
unitary operators in previous work to quantum states (i.e., density operators).
It is realized by developing several convenient techniques to manipulate
quantum states and extract information from them. In particular, we introduce a
novel technique for eigenvalue transformation of density operators and their
(non-integer) positive powers, based on the powerful quantum singular value
transformation (QSVT) [GSLW19]. The advantage of our techniques over the
existing methods is that no restrictions on density operators are required; in
sharp contrast, the previous methods usually require a lower bound of the
minimal non-zero eigenvalue of density operators. In addition, we provide some
techniques of independent interest for trace estimation, linear combinations,
and eigenvalue threshold projectors of (subnormalized) density operators, which
will be, we believe, useful in other quantum algorithms.

problem is presented. The annual energy production is maximized with
constraints on the minimum and maximum number of wind turbines placed, and on
the minimum spacing between the wind turbines. The proposed approach relies on
a density-based topology optimization method, where continuous density
variables varying between zero and one are assigned to each potential wind
turbine location. A wind turbine exists if its associated variable equals one,
otherwise it does not exist if the associated variable is zero. Intermediate
values of the density variables are penalized with interpolation schemes
traditionally used in the context of multi-material structural topology
optimization. The penalized intermediate values of the design variables become
uneconomical and the optimization algorithm is implicitly pushed towards a
preference of crisp 0-1 final values. The optimization problem is solved with a
gradient-based algorithm based on first-order information. Because of the
proposed problem formulation, the functions involved are formulated explicitly
in terms of the design variables and their analytical gradients can be
calculated directly. The numerical results highlight the capability of the
proposed approach in finding far from intuitive wind farm layouts with small
computational resources and time.

sensors perform tasks. Existing blockchain-based computation offloading schemes
usually focus on network performance improvements, such as energy consumption

offloading, resulting in the dissatisfaction of high Gas providers. Also, the
secrecy rate during the data uploading process can not be measured by a steady
value because of the time-varying characteristics of IRS-based wireless

The independently distributed assumption, on the other hand, fails to hold in
many real applications. In this survey, we consider learning settings in which
examples are dependent and their dependence relationship can be characterized
by a graph. We collect various graph-dependent concentration bounds, which are
then used to derive Rademacher and stability generalization bounds for learning

the Separation-with-Consistency (SeCo) framework, which can accomplish the
separation on unknown categories by exploiting the consistency constraints.
Furthermore, to capture richer characteristics of the novel melodies, we devise
an online matching strategy, which can bring stable enhancements with no cost

strong adaptation ability on the novel musical categories and outperforms the

Existing computation offloading schemes usually neglected time-varying

an inappropriate task partition ratio and a large secrecy outage probability.
To address these issues, we utilize an ergodic secrecy rate to determine how
many tasks are offloaded to the edge, where ergodic secrecy rate represents the
average secrecy rate over all realizations in a time-varying wireless channel.
Adaptive wiretap code rates are proposed with a secrecy outage constraint to
match time-varying wireless channels. In addition, the proposed secure
beamforming and artificial noise (AN) schemes can improve the ergodic secrecy
rates of uplink and downlink channels even without eavesdropper channel state

a shorter system delay than the strategies neglecting time-varying

introduce an archetypal model for Maxwell-demon type cyclic Brownian

Machine translation engines that rely on statistical learning from parallel

rich target-side morphology in data-driven machine translation include: (1) A
large amount of differently inflected word surface forms entails a larger
vocabulary and thus data sparsity. (2) Some inflected forms of infrequent terms
typically do not appear in the training corpus, which makes closed-vocabulary
systems unable to generate these unobserved variants. (3) Linguistic agreement
requires the system to correctly match the grammatical categories between
inflected word forms in the output sentence, both in terms of target-side
morpho-syntactic wellformedness and semantic adequacy with respect to the
input.
  In this paper, we re-investigate two target-side linguistic processing
techniques: a lemma-tag strategy and a linguistically informed word
segmentation strategy. Our experiments are conducted on a English-German
translation task under three training corpus conditions of different
magnitudes. We find that a stronger Transformer baseline leaves less room for
improvement than a shallow-RNN encoder-decoder model when translating

does benefit the Transformer model when the same system is applied to
out-of-domain input text. We also successfully apply our approach to English to

automatically answer natural language questions using triples contained in a
KG. The key idea is to represent questions and entities of a KG as
low-dimensional embeddings. Previous KGQAs have attempted to represent entities
using Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. However,
KGEs are too shallow to capture the expressive features and DL methods process
each triple independently. Recently, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has
shown to be excellent in providing entity embeddings. However, using GCNs to
KGQAs is inefficient because GCNs treat all relations equally when aggregating
neighbourhoods. Also, a problem could occur when using previous KGQAs: in most
cases, questions often have an uncertain number of answers. To address the
above issues, we propose a graph summarization technique using Recurrent
Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) and GCN. The combination of GCN and RCNN
ensures that the embeddings are propagated together with the relations relevant
to the question, and thus better answers. The proposed graph summarization
technique can be used to tackle the issue that KGQAs cannot answer questions
with an uncertain number of answers. In this paper, we demonstrated the
proposed technique on the most common type of questions, which is
single-relation questions. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed
graph summarization technique using RCNN and GCN can provide better results
when compared to the GCN. The proposed graph summarization technique
significantly improves the recall of actual answers when the questions have an
uncertain number of answers.

neural network (NN)-based orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM)
receivers to current channel conditions. This online adaptation via retraining
is mainly motivated by two reasons: First, receiver design typically focuses on
the universal optimal performance for a wide range of possible channel
realizations. However, in actual applications and within short time intervals,
only a subset of these channel parameters is likely to occur, as macro
parameters, e.g., the maximum channel delay, can assumed to be static. Second,
in-the-field alterations like temporal interferences or other conditions out of
the originally intended specifications can occur on a practical (real-world)
transmission. While conventional (filter-based) systems would require
reconfiguration or additional signal processing to cope with these unforeseen
conditions, NN-based receivers can learn to mitigate previously unseen effects
even after their deployment. For this, we showcase on-the-fly adaption to
current channel conditions and temporal alterations solely based on recovered
labels from an outer forward error correction (FEC) code without any additional

CPUs and GPUs accelerators changing yearly, if not more often. It thus has
become very challenging to write programs that efficiently use the associated
complex memory systems and take advantage of the available parallelism.
Autotuning addresses this by optimizing parameterized code to the targeted
hardware by searching for the optimal set of parameters. Empirical autotuning
has therefore gained interest during the past decades. While new autotuning
algorithms are regularly presented and published, we will show why comparing
these autotuning algorithms is a deceptively difficult task.
  In this paper, we describe our empirical study of state-of-the-art search
techniques for autotuning by comparing them on a range of sample sizes,
benchmarks and architectures. We optimize 6 tunable parameters with a
search-space size of over 2 million. The algorithms studied include Random
Search (RS), Random Forest Regression (RF), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Bayesian
Optimization with Gaussian Processes (BO GP) and Bayesian Optimization with
Tree-Parzen Estimators (BO TPE).
  Our results on the ImageCL benchmark suite suggest that the ideal autotuning
algorithm heavily depends on the sample size. In our study, BO GP and BO TPE
outperform the other algorithms in most scenarios with sample sizes from 25 to
100. However, GA usually outperforms the others for sample sizes 200 and
beyond. We generally see the most speedup to be gained over RS in the lower
range of sample sizes (25-100). However, the algorithms more consistently
outperform RS for higher sample sizes (200-400). Hence, no single
state-of-the-art algorithm outperforms the rest for all sample sizes. Some

  This spectral Favard theorem is applied to Markov chains with
$(p+2)$-diagonal transition matrices, i.e. beyond birth and death, that admit a
positive stochastic bidiagonal factorization. In the finite case, the
Karlin-McGregor spectral representation is given. It is shown that the Markov
chains are recurrent and explicit expressions in terms of the orthogonal

obtained for the countable infinite Markov chain. Now the Markov chain is not
necessarily recurrent, and it is characterized in terms of the first measure.
Ergodicity of the Markov chain is discussed in terms of the existence of a mass

a second-order Godunov-type scheme, Meshless Finite Mass (MFM), and also the
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method, with up to 128M particles. For
moderate nonlinearity, MFM maintains well the steady nonlinear warp predicted
by the affine model for a tilted inviscid disc around a central object with a
quadrupole moment. However, numerical dissipation in SPH is so severe that even
a low-amplitude nonlinear warp degrades at a resolution where MFM performs
well. A low-amplitude arbitrary warp tends to evolve towards a nonlinear steady
state. However, no such state exists in our thin disc with an angular
semi-thickness H/R = 0.02 when the outer tilt angle is beyond about 14 degrees.
The warp breaks tenuously and reconnects in adiabatic simulations, or breaks
into distinct annuli in isothermal simulations. The breaking radius lies close
to the location with the most extreme nonlinear deformation. Parametric
instability is captured only in our highest-resolution simulation, leading to
ring structures that may serve as incubators for planets around binaries.

most recent limits on the cosmic gravitons in the audio band and the claimed
evidences of the nHz domain. The simplest scenario stipulates that between the
end of inflation and the formation of light nuclei the evolution consists of a
single phase expanding at a rate that is either faster or slower than the one
of radiation. If there are instead multiple post-inflationary stages evolving
at different rates, the spectral energy density always undershoots the signals
potentially attributed to relic gravitons by the pulsar timing arrays at
intermediate frequencies but ultimately develops a local maximum. After
examining further complementary possibilities (like the presence of a secondary
stage of inflation at low-scales) we analyze the early modifications of the
effective expansion rate and argue that if the refractive index of the relic
gravitons increases during a conventional inflationary epoch the spectral
energy density is blue above the fHz and then flattens out in the $\mu$Hz
region. In this instance the signal is compatible with the unconfirmed nHz
observations, with the most recent limits of the wide-band interferometers and
with the further constraints customarily imposed on the backgrounds of relic
gravitons produced during inflation.

which are mostly based on self-training and entropy regularization, can suffer
from these non-stationary environments. Due to the distribution shift over time
in the target domain, pseudo-labels become unreliable. The noisy pseudo-labels

these issues, we propose a continual test-time adaptation approach~(CoTTA)

by using weight-averaged and augmentation-averaged predictions which are often
more accurate. On the other hand, to avoid catastrophic forgetting, we propose
to stochastically restore a small part of the neurons to the source pre-trained
weights during each iteration to help preserve source knowledge in the

J1848+15, J2051+12, J2105+22, and the pulse number can increase by one or two
orders of magnitude in active phases. The long-term trends are found for RRATs
J0139+33 and J0302+22, showing a 2-3 times increase in detected pulse number
over 1,959 days. Some RRATs show the annual variations on both pulse number and
pulse amplitude. It is hard to explain all these variation time scales by
refractive scintillation on the interstellar medium. The annual and semi-annual
variations are likely caused by scintillations of the inhomogeneous
interplanetary plasma. Our data show that the number of observational sessions
with no pulse detection over the threshold decreases exponentially with the
length of pulse silence.

build a relational policy to interact effectively with the environment? In this
paper we propose that this problem can be understood through the lens of a
sub-field of symbolic machine learning called relational reinforcement learning

relational policy learning based on a function approximator developed in RRL.
We trained and tested our model in three Atari games that required to consider
an increasingly number of potential relations: Breakout, Pong and Demon Attack.
In each game, our model was able to select adequate relational representations

between our model with models of relational and analogical reasoning, as well
as its limitations and future directions of research.

through trial and error, despite significant advancements in the relevant

(1) the challenge of integration of many different types of measurement for the
same surface to capture the multi-scale nature of roughness; (2) the technical
complexity of implementing spectral analysis methods, and of applying
mechanical or numerical models to describe surface performance; (3) a lack of
consistency between researchers and industries in how surfaces are measured,

application which attempts to overcome all three challenges. First, the
application enables the user to upload many different topography measurements
taken from a single surface, including using different techniques, and then
integrates all of them together to create a digital surface twin. Second, the
application calculates many of the commonly used topography metrics, such as
root-mean-square parameters, power spectral density (PSD), and autocorrelation
function (ACF), as well as implementing analytical and numerical calculations,
such as boundary element modeling (BEM) for elastic and plastic deformation.
Third, the application serves as a repository for users to securely store
surfaces, and if they choose, to share these with collaborators or even publish
them (with a digital object identifier) for all to access. The primary goal of
this application is to enable researchers and manufacturers to quickly and
easily apply cutting-edge tools for the characterization and
properties-modeling of real-world surfaces. An additional goal is to advance
the use of open-science principles in surface engineering by providing a FAIR

select temporal regions, each of which contains multiple clips, from one video

them. Compared to the existing unsupervised video representation learning
approaches, our PAL adapts better to downstream TAL tasks by introducing a
temporal equivariant contrastive learning paradigm in a temporally dense and

investigate this tension and determine if using Twitter does have a causal
influence on the successful release of a game by using relatively recent
developments in causal data science techniques. In this sense, this paper
highlights these causal inference developments while simultaneously informing
self-publishing independent developers whether they should indeed market their
games using Twitter. It was found that using Twitter results in an average
increase of 85.4 reviews during release week, corresponding to a 314% positive
difference. Using Twitter also doubles the chance of reaching a critical
10-review inflection point threshold on release week. These effects, however,
are moderated by the characteristics of the game, expressed as 'tags', yet in
no case is the effect of Twitter use reduced to 0. Based on these findings, it
is advised that new, self-publishing video game developers do use Twitter to
market their games.

making sure that they contain non-redundant information about the sample. To
achieve this, we measure the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of
two identical networks fed with distorted versions of an audio segment sampled

transfer these learned representations to 9 downstream classification tasks,

different evaluation setups. In addition to being simple and intuitive, our
pre-training algorithm is amenable to compute through its inherent nature of

sepsis and its organ-damaging consequences. We develop a functional two-layer
network model for sepsis based upon the interaction of parenchymal cells and
immune cells via cytokines, and the coevolutionary dynamics of parenchymal,
immune cells, and cytokines. By means of the simple paradigmatic model of phase
oscillators in a two-layer system, we analyze the emergence of organ
threatening interactions between the dysregulated immune system and the
parenchyma. We demonstrate that the complex cellular cooperation between
parenchyma and stroma (immune layer) either in the physiological or in the
pathological case can be related to dynamical patterns of the network. In this
way we explain sepsis by the dysregulation of the healthy homeostatic state
(frequency synchronized) leading to a pathological state (desynchronized or
multifrequency cluster) in the parenchyma. We provide insight into the complex
stabilizing and destabilizing interplay of parenchyma and stroma by determining
critical interaction parameters. The coupled dynamics of parenchymal cells
(metabolism) and nonspecific immune cells (response of the innate immune
system) is represented by nodes of a duplex layer. Cytokine interaction is
modeled by adaptive coupling weights between nodes representing immune cells
(with fast adaptation timescale) and parenchymal cells (slow adaptation
timescale), and between pairs of parenchymal and immune cells in the duplex
network (fixed bidirectional coupling). The proposed model allows for a
functional description of organ dysfunction in sepsis and the recurrence risk
in a plausible pathophysiological context.

theoretically and numerically study light scattering behavior from anisotropic
MoS2 nanocylinders, and highlight its distinct features advantageous over the
response of conventional silicon particles of the same shape. We establish two
remarkable phenomena, appearing in the same MoS2 particle with optimized
geometry. The first one is a pure magnetic dipole scattering associated with
the excitation of the electric-dipole anapole states. Previously reported in
core-shell hybrid (metal/dielectric) systems only, it is now demonstrated in an
all-dielectric particle. The second phenomenon is the super-deflection in the
far field: the maximum scattering may occur over a wide range of directions,
including forward-, backward- and side-scattering depending on the mutual
orientation of the MoS2 nanocylinder and the incident wave. In contrast to the
well-known Kerker and anti-Kerker effects, which appear in nanoparticles at
different frequencies, the super-deflection can be achieved by rotating the
particle at a constant frequency of incident light. Our results facilitate the
development of functional optical devices incorporating nanostructured

applications in bioengineering and medicine, for instance in cell reprogramming
or drug target identification. A control strategy often consists of a set of
interventions that, by fixing the values of some components, ensure that the
long term dynamics of the controlled system is in a desired state. A common
approach to control in the Boolean framework consists in checking how the fixed
values propagate through the network, to establish whether the effect of
percolating the interventions is sufficient to induce the target state.
Although methods based uniquely on value percolation allow for efficient
computation, they can miss many control strategies. Exhaustive methods for
control strategy identification, on the other hand, often entail high
computational costs. In order to increase the number of control strategies
identified while still benefiting from an efficient implementation, we
introduce a method based on value percolation that uses trap spaces, subspaces
of the state space that are closed with respect to the dynamics, and that can
usually be easily computed in biological networks. The approach allows for node
interventions, which fix the value of certain components, and edge
interventions, which fix the effect that one component has on another. The
method is implemented using Answer Set Programming, extending an existing
efficient implementation of value percolation to allow for the use of trap
spaces and edge control. The applicability of the approach is studied for
different control targets in a biological case study, identifying in all cases
new control strategies that would escape usual percolation-based methods.

impulse response is modeled as the realization of a zero-mean Gaussian process.
The stable spline covariance is used to include information on smooth
exponential decay of the impulse responses. We then design a new Markov chain
Monte Carlo scheme that deals with collinearity and is able to efficiently
reconstruct the posterior of the impulse responses. It is based on a variation
of Gibbs sampling which updates possibly overlapping blocks of the parameter
space on the basis of the level of collinearity affecting the different inputs.
Numerical experiments are included to test the goodness of the approach where

differential non-linearities (DNL) adopted in the Bayesian end-to-end
BeyondPlanck analysis framework. This method is nearly identical to that
developed for the official LFI Data Processing Center (DPC) analysis, and
relies on the binned rms noise profile of each detector data stream. However,
rather than building the correction profile directly from the raw rms profile,
we first fit a Gaussian to each significant ADC-induced rms decrement, and then
derive the corresponding correction model from this smooth model. The main
advange of this approach is that only samples which are significantly affected
by ADC DNLs are corrected. The new corrections are only applied to data for
which there is a clear detection of the non-linearities, and for which they
perform at least comparably with the DPC corrections. Out of a total of 88 LFI
data streams (sky and reference load for each of the 44 detectors) we apply the
new minimal ADC corrections in 25 cases, and maintain the DPC corrections in 8
cases. All these correctsion are applited to 44 or 70 GHz channels, while, as
in previous analyses, none of the 30 GHz ADCs show significant evidence of
non-linearity. By comparing the BeyondPlanck and DPC ADC correction methods, we
estimate that the residual ADC uncertainty is about two orders of magnitude
below the total noise of both the 44 and 70 GHz channels, and their impact on
current cosmological parameter estimation is small. However, we also show that
non-idealities in the ADC corrections can generate sharp stripes in the final
frequency maps, and these could be important for future joint analyses with
HFI, WMAP, or other datasets. We therefore conclude that, although the existing
corrections are adequate for LFI-based cosmological parameter analysis, further
work on LFI ADC corrections is still warranted.

pathway to transfer angular momentum between the planetary orbit and the
stellar spin. In cases where the planetary orbital period is shorter than the
stellar rotation period, this may lead to angular momentum being transferred
into the star's rotation, possibly counteracting the intrinsic stellar
spin-down induced by magnetic braking. Observationally, detecting altered
rotational states of single, cool field stars is challenging, as precise ages
for such stars are rarely available. Here we present an empirical investigation
of the rotation and magnetic activity of a sample of planet-hosting stars that
are accompanied by wide stellar companions. Without needing knowledge about the
absolute ages of the stars, we test for relative differences in activity and
rotation of the planet hosts and their co-eval companions, using X-ray
observations to measure the stellar activity levels. Employing three different
tidal interaction models, we find that host stars with planets that are
expected to tidally interact display elevated activity levels compared to their
companion stars. We also find that those activity levels agree with the
observed rotational periods for the host stars along the usual
rotation-activity relationships, implying that the effect is indeed caused by a
tidal interaction and not a purely magnetic interaction which would be expected
to affect the stellar activity, but not necessarily the rotation. We conclude
that massive, close-in planets have an impact on the stellar rotational
evolution, while the smaller, more distant planets do not have a significant
influence.

interaction between membrane inclusions, mediated by the membrane fluctuations.
We consider the case where the inclusions are separated by distances larger
than their characteristic size. Within our macroscopic approach a physical
nature of such inclusions is not essential, however we have always in mind two
prototypes of such inclusions: proteins and RNA macromolecules. Because the
interaction is driven by the membrane fluctuations, and the coupling between
inclusions and the membrane, it is possible to change the interaction potential
by external actions affecting these factors. As an example of such external
action we consider an electric field. Under external electric field (both dc or
ac), we propose a new coupling mechanism between inclusions possessing dipole
moments (as it is the case for most protein macromolecules) and the membrane.
We found, quite unexpected and presumably for the first time, that the new
coupling mechanism yields to giant enhancement of the pairwise potential of the
inclusions. This result opens up a way to handle purposefully the interaction
energy, and as well to test of the theory set forth in our article.

observations depend on an unobserved latent process. However, inference on the
process parameters of an SSM can be challenging, especially when the likelihood
of the data given the parameters is not available in closed-form. We focus on
the problem of model fitting within a Bayesian framework, for which existing
approaches include Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using Bayesian data
augmentation, sequential Monte Carlo approximation, and particle MCMC
algorithms, which combine sequential Monte Carlo approximations and MCMC steps.
However, these different methods can be inefficient when sample impoverishment
occurs during the sequential Monte Carlo approximation and/or when the MCMC
algorithm mixes poorly. We propose the use of deterministic hidden Markov
models (HMMs) to provide an efficient MCMC with data augmentation approach,
imputing the latent states within the algorithm. Our approach deterministically
approximates the SSM by a discrete HMM, which is subsequently used as an MCMC
proposal distribution for the latent states in Metropolis-within-Gibbs steps.
We demonstrate that the algorithm provides an efficient alternative method for
state-space models with near-chaotic behaviour.

functions or structures has generated and is sill generating a lot of interest
from the scientific community especially neuroscientists. These interests
especially went into high gear after empirical evidences were collected that
challenged the established paradigm that human brain structures and functions
are set from childhood and only modest changes were expected beyond. Early
synaptic plasticity rules or laws to that regard include the basic Hebbian rule
that proposed a mechanism for strengthening or weakening of synapses (weights)
during learning and memory. This rule however did not account from the fact
that weights must have bounded growth overtime. Thereafter, many other rules
were proposed to complement the basic Hebbian rule and they also possess other
desirable properties. In particular, a desirable property in synaptic
plasticity rule is that the ambient system must account for inhibition which is
often achieved if the rule used allows for a lower bound in synaptic weights.
In this paper, we propose a synaptic plasticity rule inspired from the Allee
effect, a phenomenon often observed in population dynamics. We show properties
such such as synaptic normalization, competition between weights,
de-correlation potential, and dynamic stability are satisfied. We show that in
fact, an Allee effect in synaptic plasticity can be construed as an absence of
plasticity.

the steady-state sensitivity of such single-atom probes to various observables.
We find that the probe shows distinct sensitivity maxima in the (B, T )
parameter diagram, although the underlying spin-exchange rates scale
monotonically with temperature and magnetic field. In parameter space, the
probe generally has the largest sensitivity when sensing the energy ratio
between thermal energy and Zeeman energy in an externally applied magnetic
field, while the sensitivity to the absolute energy, i.e., the sum of kinetic
and Zeeman energy, is low. We identify the parameters yielding sensitivity
maxima for a given absolute energy, which we can relate to a direct comparison
of the thermal Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with the Zeeman-energy splitting.
We compare our equilibrium results to nonequilibrium experimental results from
a single-atom quantum probe, showing that the sensitivity maxima in parameter
space qualitatively prevail also in the nonequilibrium dynamics, while a
quantitative difference remains. Our work thereby offers a microscopic
explanation for the properties and performance of this single-atom quantum

geometry, we address the effect of the sample size on the achievable accuracy
of the optical properties, focusing in particular on the phase data. We employ
$\alpha$-lactose monohydrate as a paradigmatic example and compare data that
were measured using apertures with diameters D in the range from 10 mm to 0.2
mm. For small D, strong diffraction typically invalidates a quantitative
analysis of the transmitted amplitude at low frequencies. The phase data,
however, can be evaluated to lower frequency and show a more systematic
dependence on D. For a quantitative analysis, we employ a waveguide picture for
the description of small apertures with a cylindrical bore. For D as small as
0.2 mm, corresponding to 1/D = 50 cm$^{-1}$, a circular waveguide does not
support propagating waves below its cut-off frequency $1/\lambda_c =
\omega_c/2\pi c \approx 29$ cm$^{-1}$. Experimentally, we confirm this cut-off
for cylindrical apertures with a thickness $d_{ap} = 1$ mm. Close to
$\omega_c$, the measured phase velocity is an order of magnitude larger than
$c$, the speed of light in vacuum. The cut-off is washed out if a sample is
mounted on a thin aperture with a conical bore. In this case, the phase data of
$\alpha$-lactose monohydrate for D = 0.2 mm can quantitatively be described
down to about 10 cm$^{-1}$ if the waveguide-like properties of the aperture are
taken into account in the analysis.

data when the number of clusters is unknown. One main DPGMM inference paradigm
relies on sampling. Here we consider a known state-of-art sampler (proposed by
Chang and Fisher III (2013) and improved by Dinari et al. (2019)), analyze its
failure modes, and show how to improve it, often drastically. Concretely, in
that sampler, whenever a new cluster is formed it is augmented with two
subclusters whose labels are initialized at random. Upon their evolution, the
subclusters serve to propose a split of the parent cluster. We show that the
random initialization is often problematic and hurts the otherwise-effective
sampler. Specifically, we demonstrate that this initialization tends to lead to
poor split proposals and/or too many iterations before a desired split is
accepted. This slows convergence and can damage the clustering. As a remedy, we
propose two drop-in-replacement options for the subcluster-initialization
subroutine. The first is an intuitive heuristic while the second is based on
deep learning. We show that the proposed approach yields better splits, which
in turn translate to substantial improvements in performance, results, and

applying NSI-SOD methods to optical RSIs fails to achieve satisfactory results.
In this paper, we propose a novel Adjacent Context Coordination Network
(ACCoNet) to explore the coordination of adjacent features in an
encoder-decoder architecture for RSI-SOD. Specifically, ACCoNet consists of
three parts: an encoder, Adjacent Context Coordination Modules (ACCoMs), and a
decoder. As the key component of ACCoNet, ACCoM activates the salient regions
of output features of the encoder and transmits them to the decoder. ACCoM
contains a local branch and two adjacent branches to coordinate the multi-level
features simultaneously. The local branch highlights the salient regions in an
adaptive way, while the adjacent branches introduce global information of
adjacent levels to enhance salient regions. Additionally, to extend the
capabilities of the classic decoder block (i.e., several cascaded convolutional
layers), we extend it with two bifurcations and propose a
Bifurcation-Aggregation Block to capture the contextual information in the
decoder. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed ACCoNet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art methods under nine evaluation

been an increasing interest in using machine learning methods alongside
model-based approaches for control and estimation. The number of new methods
and theoretical findings using machine learning for model-based control and

principles behind an easy-to-use Python toolbox that allows to quickly and
efficiently solve machine-learning-supported optimization, model predictive
control, and estimation problems. The toolbox leverages state-of-the-art
machine learning libraries to train components used to define the problem. It
allows to efficiently solve the resulting optimization problems. Machine
learning can be used for a broad spectrum of tasks, ranging from model
predictive control for stabilization, setpoint tracking, path following, and
trajectory tracking to moving horizon estimation and Kalman filtering. For
linear systems, it enables quick code generation for embedded MPC applications.
HILO-MPC is flexible and adaptable, making it especially suitable for research

Traditional dense optical flow methods compute the pixel displacement between

that it is possible to compute per-pixel, continuous-time optical flow by
additionally using events from an event camera. Events provide temporally
fine-grained information about movement in image space due to their
asynchronous nature and microsecond response time. We leverage these benefits
to predict pixel trajectories densely in continuous-time via parameterized
B\'ezier curves. To achieve this, we introduce multiple innovations to build a
neural network with strong inductive biases for this task: First, we build
multiple sequential correlation volumes in time using event data. Second, we
use B\'ezier curves to index these correlation volumes at multiple timestamps
along the trajectory. Third, we use the retrieved correlation to update the
B\'ezier curve representations iteratively. Our method can optionally include
image pairs to boost performance further. The proposed approach outperforms

highly variable data quality at client nodes. The robustness is achieved by a
denoising CycleGAN model at each client of the federation that maps arbitrary
quality images into the same target quality, counteracting the severe data
variability evident in real-world FL use-cases. Each client is provided with
the target style, which is the same for all clients, and trains their own
denoiser. Our qualitative and quantitative results suggest that this FL model
performs comparably to, and in some cases better than, a model that has

mass-metallicity relation (rMZR) of galaxies in local universe. We know that
the global mass-metallicity relation (MZR) results from the integral of rMZR,
and it will evolve with the redshift. However, the evolution of rMZR with
redshift is still unclear due to the low spatial resolution and signal-to-noise
ratio. There are currently too few observations beyond local universe, and only
simulations can reproduce the evolution of rMZR with redshift. Methods: In this
work, we select ten emission-line galaxies with an average redshift of $z\sim
0.26$ from MUSE-Wide DR1. We obtain the spatially resolved star formation rate
(SFR) and metallicity from the integral field spectroscopy (IFS), as well as
the stellar mass surface density from the 3D-HST photometry. We derive the
rSFMS and rMZR at $z\sim 0.26$ and compare them with local galaxies. Results:
We find the rSFMS of galaxies at $z\sim 0.26$ has a slope of $\sim$0.771. The
rMZR exists at $z\sim 0.26$, showing a similar shape to the local universe but
a lower average metallicity about $\sim$0.11 dex than the local one. In
addition, we also study their spatially resolved fundamental metallicity
relation (rFMR). However, there is no obvious evidence that rFMR exists at
$z\sim$0.26 and it is not an extension of rMZR at a high SFR. Conclusions:
Similar to their global versions, the rSFMS and rMZR of galaxies also evolve
with redshift. Given the fixed stellar mass, galaxies at higher redshift show
higher SFR and lower metallicity. These suggest that the evolution of the
global galaxy properties with redshift may result from integrating the
evolution of spatially resolved properties of galaxies.

an argument that links the photoemission line broadening with an operator

deal with the effect of stellar contamination, we model TRAPPIST-1 active

Our analysis reveals that TRAPPIST-1h is unlikely to host an aerosol-free

scenario is that of a flat, featureless transmission spectrum in the WFC3/G141

learning methods are representative yet generalize poor for real rain. The
opposite holds true for the model-driven unsupervised optimization methods. To
overcome these problems, we propose a unified unsupervised learning framework
which inherits the generalization and representation merits for real rain
removal. Specifically, we first discover a simple yet important domain
knowledge that directional rain streak is anisotropic while the natural clean
image is isotropic, and formulate the structural discrepancy into the energy
function of the optimization model. Consequently, we design an optimization
model-driven deep CNN in which the unsupervised loss function of the
optimization model is enforced on the proposed network for better
generalization. In addition, the architecture of the network mimics the main
role of the optimization models with better feature representation. On one
hand, we take advantage of the deep network to improve the representation. On
the other hand, we utilize the unsupervised loss of the optimization model for
better generalization. Overall, the unsupervised learning framework achieves
good generalization and representation: unsupervised training (loss) with only
a few real rainy images (input) and physical meaning network (architecture).
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world rain datasets show the

mentioning the difficulty of a code comprehension task might anchor
participants and their perception of the task itself. In this study, we
investigated in a randomized, controlled experiment with 256 participants (50
software professionals and 206 computer science students) whether a hint about
the difficulty of the code to be understood in a task description anchors
participants in their own code comprehensibility ratings. Subjective code
evaluations are a commonly used measure for how well a developer in a code
comprehension study understood code. Accordingly, it is important to understand
how robust these measures are to cognitive biases such as the anchoring effect.
Our results show that participants are significantly influenced by the initial
scenario description in their assessment of code comprehensibility. An initial
hint of hard to understand code leads participants to assess the code as harder
to understand than participants who received no hint or a hint of easy to
understand code. This affects students and professionals alike. We discuss
examples of design decisions and contextual factors in the conduct of code
comprehension experiments that can induce an anchoring effect, and recommend
the use of more robust comprehension measures in code comprehension studies to

a black-box function plays a more significant role than only one optimum in
many practical situations. Covering as much as possible of the solution set
through limited evaluations to the black-box objective function is defined as
the Black-Box Coverage (BBC) problem in this paper. We formalized this problem
in a sample-based search paradigm and constructed a coverage criterion with
Confusion Matrix Analysis. Further, we propose LAMBDA (Latent-Action
Monte-Carlo Beam Search with Density Adaption) to solve BBC problems. LAMBDA
can focus around the solution set quickly by recursively partitioning the
search space into accepted and rejected sub-spaces. Compared with La-MCTS,
LAMBDA introduces density information to overcome the sampling bias of
optimization and obtain more exploration. Benchmarking shows, LAMBDA achieved
state-of-the-art performance among all baselines and was at most 33x faster to
get 95% coverage than Random Search. Experiments also demonstrate that LAMBDA

establish the complementarity relation which describes the limit pressure by a
degenerate elliptic equation. Not only our analysis uses a completely different

estimate of the pressure gradient, regularity \`a la Aronson-B\'enilan, and a
uniform $L^1$ estimate for the time derivative of the pressure. Furthermore,
for the Hele-Shaw problem, we prove the uniqueness of solutions, meaning that
the incompressible limit of the PKS model is unique. In addition, we establish
the corresponding incompressible limit of the stationary state for the PKS
model with a given mass, where, different from the case of PKS model, we obtain
the uniform bound of pressure and the uniformly bounded support of density.

Internet of Drones Simulator (IoD-Sim), a comprehensive and versatile open
source tool that addresses the many facets of the IoD. IoD-Sim is a Network
Simulator 3 (ns-3)-based simulator organized in a 3-layer stack, composed by
(i) the Underlying Platform, which provides the telecommunication primitives
for different standardized protocol stacks, (ii) the Core, that implements all
the fundamental features of an IoD scenario, and (iii) the Simulation
Development Platform, mainly composed by a set of tools that speeds up the
graphical design for every possible use-case. In order to prove the huge
potential of this proposal, three different scenarios are presented and
analyzed from both a software perspective and a telecommunication standpoint.
The peculiarities of this open-source tool are of interest for researchers in
academia, as they will be able to extend to model upcoming specifications,
including, but not limited to, mobile networks and satellite communications.
Still, it will certainly be of relevance in industry to accelerate the design

this paper, we propose a spintronic interconnect device where multiple

skyrmions, skyrmioniums, and anti-skyrmionites. The proposed spintronic

The notion of Condorcet winners has been studied intensively for many decades,
yet some basic questions remain open. In this paper, we consider a model where
each voter chooses their ranking randomly according to some probability
distribution among all rankings. One may then ask about the probability to have
a Condorcet winner with these randomly chosen rankings (which, of course,
depends on $n$ and $k$, and the underlying probability distribution on the set

of having a Condorcet winner for a fixed number $2k-1$ of voters and $n$

years. While some authors suggested that the impartial culture should exhibit
the lowest possible probability of having a Condorcet winner, in fact the

way of channel pruning for the deployment of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) under hardware constraints. To fulfill the searching, a one-shot
supernet is usually leveraged to efficiently evaluate the performance
\wrt~different network widths. However, current methods mainly follow a
\textit{unilaterally augmented} (UA) principle for the evaluation of each
width, which induces the training unfairness of channels in supernet. In this
paper, we introduce a new supernet called Bilaterally Coupled Network (BCNet)
to address this issue. In BCNet, each channel is fairly trained and responsible
for the same amount of network widths, thus each network width can be evaluated
more accurately. Besides, we propose to reduce the redundant search space and
present the BCNetV2 as the enhanced supernet to ensure rigorous training
fairness over channels. Furthermore, we leverage a stochastic complementary
strategy for training the BCNet, and propose a prior initial population
sampling method to boost the performance of the evolutionary search. We also
propose the first open-source width benchmark on macro structures named
Channel-Bench-Macro for the better comparison of width search algorithms.
Extensive experiments on benchmark CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets indicate that
our method can achieve state-of-the-art or competing performance over other
baseline methods. Moreover, our method turns out to further boost the
performance of NAS models by refining their network widths. For example, with
the same FLOPs budget, our obtained EfficientNet-B0 achieves 77.53\% Top-1

0.65\%.

current state as well as an old state of the same generator to create good and
bad quality reconstruction examples. The discriminator is trained on these
examples to detect the subtle distortions that are often present in the
reconstructions of anomalous data. In addition, we propose an efficient generic

destabilized by small perturbations and rupture into droplets. As successfully
predicted by the thin film equation (TFE), the rupture dynamics are dictated by
the liquid-solid interaction. The theory describes the latter using the
disjoining pressure or, equivalently, the contact angle. The introduction of a
secondary fluid can lead to a richer phenomenology thanks to the presence of
different fluid/surface interaction energies but has so far not been
investigated. In this work, we study the rupture of liquid films with different
heights immersed in a secondary fluid using a multi-component lattice Boltzmann
(LB) approach. We investigate a wide range of surface interaction energies,
equilibrium contact angles, and film thicknesses. We found that the rupture
time can differ by about one order of magnitude for identical equilibrium
contact angles but different surface free energies. Interestingly, the TFE
describes the observed breakup dynamics qualitatively well, up to equilibrium
contact angles as large as 130$^\circ$. A small film thickness is a much
stricter requirement for the validity of the TFE, and agreement with LB results
is found only for ratios $\epsilon=h/L$ of the film height $h$ and lateral

microstructure. The ultimate purpose is to rapidly fingerprint sample images in

includes, but is not limited to, quantification of the disparity between
microstructures for quality control, classifying microstructures, predicting
materials properties from image data and identifying potential processing
routes to engineer new materials with specific properties. Here, we consider
microstructure classification and utilise the resulting features over a range
of related machine learning tasks, namely supervised, semi-supervised, and
unsupervised learning.
  The approach is applied to two distinct datasets to illustrate various
aspects and some recommendations are made based on the findings. In particular,
methods that leverage transfer learning with convolutional neural networks

other methods. Additionally, dimensionality reduction of these CNN-based

the supervised learning approaches considered. In situations where there is a
large dataset with only a handful of images labelled, graph-based label
propagation to unlabelled data is shown to be favourable over discarding
unlabelled data and performing supervised learning. In particular, label
propagation by Poisson learning is shown to be highly effective at low label

An interpolation method is used to predict the capsule dynamics for any value

Numerical evidence shows the ability of the reduced model to predict the

amplitude of the intracell hopping. With a numerical simulation, we
quantitatively show that the photonic, magnonic and magnon-to-photon state
transfers can be achieved with high fidelity in the cavity-magnon lattice.
Spectacularly, the three different types of quantum state transfer schemes can
be even transformed to each other in a controllable fashion. This system
provides a novel way of realizing quantum state transfer and can be implemented

processes with Hurst exponent $H< 0.5$ for the modeling of volatility of

method for estimating the roughness of a function based on discrete sample,
using the concept of normalized $p$-th variation along a sequence of
partitions. We investigate the finite sample performance of our estimator for
measuring the roughness of sample paths of stochastic processes using detailed
numerical experiments based on sample paths of fractional Brownian motion and
other fractional processes. We then apply this method to estimate the roughness
of realized volatility signals based on high-frequency observations. Detailed
numerical experiments based on stochastic volatility models show that, even
when the instantaneous volatility has diffusive dynamics with the same
roughness as Brownian motion, the realized volatility exhibits rough behaviour
corresponding to a Hurst exponent significantly smaller than $0.5$. Comparison
of roughness estimates for realized and instantaneous volatility in fractional
volatility models with different values of Hurst exponent shows that,
irrespective of the roughness of the spot volatility process, realized
volatility always exhibits `rough' behaviour with an apparent Hurst index
$\hat{H}<0.5$. These results suggest that the origin of the roughness observed
in realized volatility time-series lies in the microstructure noise rather than
the volatility process itself.

environments is increasingly critical in the era of Industry 4.0. However,
achieving robust and autonomous collaboration among humans and other robots
requires modern robotic systems to have effective proximity perception and
reactive obstacle avoidance. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for
reactive whole-body obstacle avoidance that ensures conflict-free robot-robot
interactions even in dynamic environment. Unlike existing approaches based on
Jacobian-type, sampling based or geometric techniques, our methodology
leverages the latest deep learning advances and topological manifold learning,
enabling it to be readily generalized to other problem settings with high
computing efficiency and fast graph traversal techniques. Our approach allows a
robotic arm to proactively avoid obstacles of arbitrary 3D shapes without
direct contact, a significant improvement over traditional industrial cobot
settings. To validate our approach, we implement it on a robotic platform
consisting of dual 6-DoF robotic arms with optimized proximity sensor
placement, capable of working collaboratively with varying levels of
interference. Specifically, one arm performs reactive whole-body obstacle
avoidance while achieving its pre-determined objective, while the other arm
emulates the presence of a human collaborator with independent and potentially
adversarial movements. Our methodology provides a robust and effective solution
for safe human-robot collaboration in non-stationary environments.

nocturnal or daytime radiative cooling is expected to lead to cost-effective
passive heat management without the need of inefficient and costly artificial

systematic errors on important subsets (or slices) of data. Identifying
underperforming slices is particularly challenging when working with
high-dimensional inputs (e.g. images, audio), where important slices are often
unlabeled. In order to address this issue, recent studies have proposed
automated slice discovery methods (SDMs), which leverage learned model
representations to mine input data for slices on which a model performs poorly.
To be useful to a practitioner, these methods must identify slices that are
both underperforming and coherent (i.e. united by a human-understandable
concept). However, no quantitative evaluation framework currently exists for
rigorously assessing SDMs with respect to these criteria. Additionally, prior
qualitative evaluations have shown that SDMs often identify slices that are
incoherent. In this work, we address these challenges by first designing a
principled evaluation framework that enables a quantitative comparison of SDMs
across 1,235 slice discovery settings in three input domains (natural images,
medical images, and time-series data). Then, motivated by the recent
development of powerful cross-modal representation learning approaches, we
present Domino, an SDM that leverages cross-modal embeddings and a novel
error-aware mixture model to discover and describe coherent slices. We find
that Domino accurately identifies 36% of the 1,235 slices in our framework - a
12 percentage point improvement over prior methods. Further, Domino is the
first SDM that can provide natural language descriptions of identified slices,
correctly generating the exact name of the slice in 35% of settings.

  Deep Learning","Submitted to conference",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Machine learning (ML) models that use deep neural networks are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Such attacks involve the insertion of a (hidden) trigger by
an adversary. As a consequence, any input that contains the trigger will cause
the neural network to misclassify the input to a (single) target class, while
classifying other inputs without a trigger correctly. ML models that contain a
backdoor are called Trojan models. Backdoors can have severe consequences in
safety-critical cyber and cyber physical systems when only the outputs of the
model are available. Defense mechanisms have been developed and illustrated to
be able to distinguish between outputs from a Trojan model and a non-Trojan
model in the case of a single-target backdoor attack with accuracy > 96
percent. Understanding the limitations of a defense mechanism requires the
construction of examples where the mechanism fails. Current single-target
backdoor attacks require one trigger per target class. We introduce a new, more
general attack that will enable a single trigger to result in misclassification
to more than one target class. Such a misclassification will depend on the true
(actual) class that the input belongs to. We term this category of attacks
multi-target backdoor attacks. We demonstrate that a Trojan model with either a
single-target or multi-target trigger can be trained so that the accuracy of a
defense mechanism that seeks to distinguish between outputs coming from a
Trojan and a non-Trojan model will be reduced. Our approach uses the non-Trojan
model as a teacher for the Trojan model and solves a min-max optimization
problem between the Trojan model and defense mechanism. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that our training procedure reduces the accuracy of a
state-of-the-art defense mechanism from >96 to 0 percent.

properties, centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT) have found a wide range of
applications and correspondingly a vast development in their literature.
However the computation of CVT in higher dimensional spaces still remains
difficult. In this paper, we exploit the non-uniqueness of CVTs in higher
dimensional spaces for their computation. We construct such high dimensional
tessellations from CVTs in one-dimensional spaces. We then prove that such a
tessellation is centroidal under the condition of independence among densities
over the one-dimensional spaces considered. Various numerical evaluations
backup the theoretical result through the low energy of the tessellations. The
resulting grid-like tessellations are obtained efficiently with minimal

behaviors, which can be solved by characterizing item relationships in
sequences. Due to the data sparsity and noise issues in sequences, a new
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm is proposed to improve the performance,
which employs contrastive learning between positive and negative views of
sequences.
  However, existing methods all construct views by adopting augmentation from
data perspectives, while we argue that 1) optimal data augmentation methods are
hard to devise, 2) data augmentation methods destroy sequential correlations,
and 3) data augmentation fails to incorporate comprehensive self-supervised
signals.
  Therefore, we investigate the possibility of model augmentation to construct
view pairs. We propose three levels of model augmentation methods: neuron
masking, layer dropping, and encoder complementing.
  This work opens up a novel direction in constructing views for contrastive
SSL. Experiments verify the efficacy of model augmentation for the SSL in the
sequential recommendation. Code is

out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization. For instance, many OoD methods rely
on penalty terms whose optimization is challenging. They are either too strong
to optimize reliably or too weak to achieve their goals.
  We propose to initialize the networks with a rich representation containing a
palette of potentially useful features, ready to be used by even simple models.
On the one hand, a rich representation provides a good initialization for the
optimizer. On the other hand, it also provides an inductive bias that helps OoD
generalization. Such a representation is constructed with the Rich Feature
Construction (RFC) algorithm, also called the Bonsai algorithm, which consists
of a succession of training episodes. During discovery episodes, we craft a
multi-objective optimization criterion and its associated datasets in a manner
that prevents the network from using the features constructed in the previous
iterations. During synthesis episodes, we use knowledge distillation to force
the network to simultaneously represent all the previously discovered features.
  Initializing the networks with Bonsai representations consistently helps six
OoD methods achieve top performance on ColoredMNIST benchmark. The same
technique substantially outperforms comparable results on the Wilds Camelyon17
task, eliminates the high result variance that plagues other methods, and makes
hyperparameter tuning and model selection more reliable.

person's behavior has on the future behavior of their peers. The key challenge
is that shared behavior between friends could be equally explained by influence
or by two other confounding factors: 1) latent traits that caused people to
both become friends and engage in the behavior, and 2) latent preferences for
the behavior. This paper addresses the challenges of estimating social
influence with three contributions. First, we formalize social influence as a
causal effect, one which requires inferences about hypothetical interventions.
Second, we develop Poisson Influence Factorization (PIF), a method for
estimating social influence from observational data. PIF fits probabilistic
factor models to networks and behavior data to infer variables that serve as
substitutes for the confounding latent traits. Third, we develop assumptions
under which PIF recovers estimates of social influence. We empirically study
PIF with semi-synthetic and real data from Last.fm, and conduct a sensitivity
analysis. We find that PIF estimates social influence most accurately compared
to related methods and remains robust under some violations of its assumptions.

data-driven modelling of the two-dimensional Euler equations using coarse-grid
SPDEs. The framework of Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport (SALT) [Cotter et
al., 2019] is employed to define a stochastic forcing that is decomposed in
terms of a deterministic basis (empirical orthogonal functions, EOFs)
multiplied by temporal traces, here regarded as stochastic processes. The EOFs
are obtained from a fine-grid data set and are defined in conjunction with
corresponding deterministic time series. We construct stochastic processes that
mimic properties of the measured time series. In particular, the processes are
defined such that the underlying probability density functions (pdfs) or the
estimated correlation time of the time series are retained. These stochastic
models are compared to stochastic forcing based on Gaussian noise, which does
not use any information of the time series. We perform uncertainty
quantification tests and compare stochastic ensembles in terms of mean and
spread. Reduced uncertainty is observed for the developed models. On short
timescales, such as those used for data assimilation [Cotter et al., 2020], the
stochastic models show a reduced ensemble mean error and a reduced spread.
Particularly, using estimated pdfs yields stochastic ensembles which rarely
fail to capture the reference solution on small time scales, whereas
introducing correlation into the stochastic models improves the quality of the
coarse-grid predictions with respect to Gaussian noise.
