deployed commercial models from being stealthily stolen by model distillations.
However, watermarks produced by most existing model watermarking methods can be
easily evaded by ensemble distillation, because averaging the outputs of
multiple ensembled models can significantly reduce or even erase the
watermarks. In this paper, we focus on tackling the challenging task of
defending against ensemble distillation. We propose a novel watermarking
technique named CosWM to achieve outstanding model watermarking performance
against ensemble distillation. CosWM is not only elegant in design, but also
comes with desirable theoretical guarantees. Our extensive experiments on
public data sets demonstrate the excellent performance of CosWM and its
advantages over the state-of-the-art baselines.

containing ordinary atomic matter, say diamond, under high pressure ensured by
the surface tension of the separation domain wall. We also seek to explain the
self interactions of dark matter suggested by astronomical studies of dwarf
galaxies and the central structure of galaxy clusters. The interaction with
matter in the shielding is responsible for slowing the dark matter down to a
low terminal velocity, so underground detectors have insufficient energy for
detection. Further we explain the ""mysterious"" X-ray line of 3.5 keV, even the
3.5 keV X-ray radiation from the Tycho supernova remnant. The DAMA-LIBRA and
Xenon1T experiments see decaying dark matter pearls. Both these underground
experiments see events with about 3.5 keV energy, just the energy of the X-ray
line. We fit numerically the cross section over mass ratio for the self
interaction of the dark matter as observed in the study of dwarf galaxies and
find the size of the pearls to be rather close to the smallest possible in our
model. However DAMA cause some problem to get heavier pearls. Also the total
energy of the dark matter pearls stopped in the shield is reasonably matching.
Accepting the different phases of the vacuum the model could be realized inside
the Standard Model, our whole scheme could be realized inside the Standard

flavor in astrophysical settings like supernovae and neutron star binary merger

settings, simulations in the mean-field approximation show that
neutrino-neutrino interactions can overtake vacuum oscillations and give rise
to fast collective flavor evolution on time-scales $t\propto\mu^{-1}$, with
$\mu$ proportional to the local neutrino density. In this work, we study the
full out-of-equilibrium flavor dynamics in simple multi-angle geometries
displaying fast oscillations in the mean field linear stability analysis.
Focusing on simple initial conditions, we analyze the production of pair
correlations and entanglement in the complete many-body-dynamics as a function
of the number $N$ of neutrinos in the system, for up to thousands of neutrinos.
Similarly to simpler geometries with only two neutrino beams, we identify three
regimes: stable configurations with vanishing flavor oscillations, marginally
unstable configurations with evolution occurring on long time scales
$\tau\approx\mu^{-1}\sqrt{N}$, and unstable configurations showing flavor
evolution on short time scales $\tau\approx\mu^{-1}\log(N)$. We present
evidence that these fast collective modes are generated by the same dynamical
phase transition which leads to the slow bipolar oscillations, establishing a
connection between these two phenomena and explaining the difference in their
time scales. We conclude by discussing a semi-classical approximation which
reproduces the entanglement entropy at short to medium time scales and can be
potentially useful in situations with more complicated geometries where
classical simulation methods starts to become inefficient.

training loss, which benefits semi-supervised semantic segmentation. However,
these perturbations destroy image context and introduce unnatural boundaries,
which is harmful for semantic segmentation. Besides, the widely adopted
semi-supervised learning framework, i.e. mean-teacher, suffers performance
limitation since the student model finally converges to the teacher model. In
this paper, first of all, we propose a context friendly differentiable
geometric warping to conduct unsupervised data augmentation; secondly, a novel
adversarial dual-student framework is proposed to improve the Mean-Teacher from
the following two aspects: (1) dual student models are learned independently

diversities; (2) adversarial training scheme is applied to both students and
the discriminators are resorted to distinguish reliable pseudo-label of

  Programming","37 pages",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Currently, the simplex method and the interior point method are indisputably
the most popular algorithms for solving linear programs, LPs. Unlike general
conic programs, LPs with a finite optimal value do not require strict
feasibility in order to establish strong duality. Hence strict feasibility is
seldom a concern, even though strict feasibility is equivalent to stability and
a compact dual optimal set. This lack of concern is also true for other types
of degeneracy of basic feasible solutions in LP. In this paper we discuss that
the specific degeneracy that arises from lack of strict feasibility necessarily
causes difficulties in both simplex and interior point methods. In particular,
we show that the lack of strict feasibility implies that every basic feasible
solution, BFS, is degenerate; thus conversely, the existence of a nondegenerate
BFS implies that strict feasibility (regularity) holds. We prove the results
using facial reduction and simple linear algebra. In particular, the facially
reduced system reveals the implicit non-surjectivity of the linear map of the
equality constraint system. As a consequence, we emphasize that facial
reduction involves two steps where, the first guarantees strict feasibility,
and the second recovers full row rank of the constraint matrix. This
illustrates the implicit singularity of problems where strict feasibility
fails, and also helps in obtaining new efficient techniques for preproccessing.
We include an efficient preprocessing method that can be performed as an
extension of phase-I of the two-phase simplex method. We show that this can be
used to avoid the loss of precision for many well known problem sets in the
literature, e.g., the NETLIB problem set.

organizations sell their invoices to banks or financial institutions at a
discount to gain faster access to the invoice amount. In global trade, ocean
and land carriers exercise invoice factoring to gain quick access to the money
they get paid for the shipment of consignments by shippers. Shippers typically
clear the invoice payment within 60-90 days of goods getting delivered. In
order to get early access to capital, carriers initiate invoice factoring after
the completion of goods delivery to the shipper. In this work, we provide an
approach to enable accelerated carrier invoice factoring even before the
delivery of goods. Carrier invoice value for a given shipment depends on the
actual values of shipment tracking events. We predict the carrier invoice value
at different freight transport milestone events as the goods transportation
progresses from supplier to shipper using smart contracts on a blockchain
network that is operated by the global trade logistics participants. The
prediction at a given stage is based on past shipment tracking events and
predicted future shipment tracking events. Accurate prediction of invoice value
for ongoing shipment enables the carrier organization to initiate invoice
factoring on the trade finance network before the completion of goods delivery
to the shipper. Further, based on the past accuracy of prediction models, the
financial institutions may choose to release the invoice amount in installments
at different freight transportation milestone events.

Interactions take place through bridging events where instances exchange data.
Object-centric processes are recently gaining popularity in academia and

poses significant challenges in predictive analytics due to the complex
intricacy of the process instances that relate to each other via many-to-many

an approach to incorporate the information about the object interactions into

that disk migration should naturally drive orbits into chains of mean motion
resonances (MMRs). In order to explain the dearth of MMR chains observed at Gyr
ages ($<1\%$), this picture requires such configurations to destabilize and
scramble period ratios following disk dispersal. Strikingly, the only two known
stars with three or more planets younger than $\lesssim 100$ Myrs, HR 8799 and
V1298 Tau, have been suggested to be in such MMR chains, given the orbits'
near-integer period ratios. We incorporate recent transit and radial velocity
observations of the V1298 Tau system, and investigate constraints on the
system's orbital architecture imposed by requiring dynamical stability on
timescales much shorter than the system's age. We show that the recent
radial-velocity mass measurement of V1298 Tau $b$ places it within a factor of
two of the instability limit, and that this allows us to set significantly
lower limits on the eccentricity ($e_b \leq 0.17$ at $99.7\%$ confidence).
Additionally, we rule out a resonant chain configuration for V1298 Tau at
$\gtrsim 99\%$ confidence. Thus, if the $\sim 23$ Myr-old V1298 Tau system did
form as a resonant chain, it must have undergone instability and rearrangement
shortly after disk dispersal. We expect that similar stability constrained
characterization of future young multi-planet systems will be valuable in
informing planet formation models.

practice, two issues often arise. First, many problems have very large action
spaces and we may not observe rewards for most actions, and so in finite
samples we may encounter a positivity violation. Second, many recommendation
systems are not probabilistic and so having access to logging and target policy
densities may not be feasible. To address these issues, we introduce the
featurized embedded permutation weighting estimator. The estimator computes the
density ratio in an action embedding space, which reduces the possibility of

Sensing Images. Clustering or segmentation methods usually precede the
classification task and are used as support tools for manual labeling. The most
common algorithms, such as k-means, mean-shift, and MRS, require an extra
manual step to find the scale parameter. The segmentation results are severely
affected if the parameters are not correctly tuned and diverge from the optimal
values. Additionally, the search for the optimal scale is a costly task, as it
requires a comprehensive hyper-parameter search. This paper proposes and
evaluates a method for segmentation of Hyperspectral Images using the Dirichlet
Process Gaussian Mixture Model. Our model can self-regulate the parameters
until it finds the optimal values of scale and the number of clusters in a
given dataset. The results demonstrate the potential of our method to find
objects in a Hyperspectral Image while bypassing the burden of manual search of
the optimal parameters. In addition, our model also produces similar results on
noisy datasets, while previous research usually required a pre-processing task

We propose and demonstrate a bathymetry inversion method using a
deep-learning-based surrogate for shallow water equations solvers. The
surrogate uses the convolutional autoencoder with a shared-encoder,
separate-decoder architecture. It encodes the input bathymetry and decodes to
separate outputs for flow-field variables. A gradient-based optimizer is used
to perform bathymetry inversion with the trained surrogate. Two
physically-based constraints on both bed elevation value and slope have to be
added as inversion loss regularizations to obtain usable inversion results.
Using the ""L-curve"" criterion, a heuristic approach was proposed to determine
the regularization parameters. Both the surrogate model and the inversion
algorithm show good performance. We found the bathymetry inversion process has
two distinctive stages, which resembles the sculptural process of initial
broad-brush calving and final detailing. The inversion loss due to flow
prediction error reaches its minimum in the first stage and remains almost
constant afterward. The bed elevation value and slope regularizations play the
dominant role in the second stage in selecting the most probable solution. We
also found the surrogate architecture (whether with both velocity and water
surface elevation or velocity only as outputs) does not show significant impact
on inversion result.

widely believed to exhibit a statistical/computational gap, but there is
surprisingly little formal evidence for this belief, even in the form of
examples that are hard for restricted classes of algorithms. Recent work has
shown that, for certain covariance matrices, the broad class of Preconditioned
Lasso programs provably cannot succeed on polylogarithmically sparse signals
with a sublinear number of samples. However, this lower bound only shows that
for every preconditioner, there exists at least one signal that it fails to
recover successfully. This leaves open the possibility that, for example,
trying multiple different preconditioners solves every sparse linear regression
problem.
  In this work, we prove a stronger lower bound that overcomes this issue. For
an appropriate covariance matrix, we construct a single signal distribution on
which any invertibly-preconditioned Lasso program fails with high probability,
unless it receives a linear number of samples.
  Surprisingly, at the heart of our lower bound is a new positive result in
compressed sensing. We show that standard sparse random designs are with high
probability robust to adversarial measurement erasures, in the sense that if
$b$ measurements are erased, then all but $O(b)$ of the coordinates of the
signal are still information-theoretically identifiable. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that partial recoverability of arbitrary sparse signals under
erasures has been studied in compressed sensing.

dispersion of the particles is achieved via a non-classical mechanism, i.e.,
their binding to the evolving quantized vortices. However, there is limited
existing knowledge on how the vortices diffuse and spread in turbulent quantum
fluids. Here we report a systematic numerical study of the apparent diffusion
of vortices in a random vortex tangle in superfluid helium-4 using full
Biot-Savart simulation. We reveal that the vortices in pure superfluid exhibit
a universal anomalous diffusion (superdiffusion) at small times, which transits
to normal diffusion at large times. This behavior is found to be caused by a
generic scaling property of the vortex velocity, which should exist in all
quantum fluids where the Biot-Savart law governs the vortex motion. Our
simulation at finite temperatures also nicely reproduces recent experimental
observations. The knowledge obtained from this study may form the foundation
for understanding turbulent transport and universal vortex dynamics in various

A moderately positive correlation (0.53) between the decarbonisation targets
and the share of hydrogen-based carriers in final energy demand underlines the
relevance for reaching the climate targets. Additionally, value creation
effects of about 5 bn EUR/a in 2030 can be expected for hydrogen-based
carriers. By 2050, these effects will increase to almost 16 bn EUR/a. Hydrogen
is expected to be mainly produced domestically while synthetic fuels are

audio encoder and then a language decoder is used to generate the captions.
Training an audio captioning system often encounters the problem of data
scarcity. Transferring knowledge from pre-trained audio models such as
Pre-trained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) have recently emerged as a useful
method to mitigate this issue. However, there is less attention on exploiting
pre-trained language models for the decoder, compared with the encoder. BERT is
a pre-trained language model that has been extensively used in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. Nevertheless, the potential of BERT as the language
decoder for audio captioning has not been investigated. In this study, we
demonstrate the efficacy of the pre-trained BERT model for audio captioning.
Specifically, we apply PANNs as the encoder and initialize the decoder from the
public pre-trained BERT models. We conduct an empirical study on the use of
these BERT models for the decoder in the audio captioning model. Our models
achieve competitive results with the existing audio captioning methods on the
AudioCaps dataset.

feedstock for the synthesis of larger, more complex organic molecules. In order
to accurately discern the physico-chemical processes in which CO2 plays a role,
it is necessary to have laboratory-generated spectra to compare against
observational data acquired by ground- and space-based telescopes. A key factor
which is known to influence the appearance of such spectra is temperature,
especially when the spectra are acquired in the infrared and ultraviolet. In
this present study, we describe the results of a systematic investigation
looking into: (i) the influence of thermal annealing on the mid-IR and VUV
absorption spectra of pure, unirradiated CO2 astrophysical ice analogues
prepared at various temperatures, and (ii) the influence of temperature on the
chemical products of electron irradiation of similar ices. Our results indicate
that both mid-IR and VUV spectra of pure CO2 ices are sensitive to the
structural and chemical changes induced by thermal annealing. Furthermore,
using mid-IR spectroscopy, we have successfully identified the production of
radiolytic daughter molecules as a result of 1 keV electron irradiation and the
influence of temperature over this chemistry. Such results are directly
applicable to studies on the chemistry of interstellar ices, comets, and icy
lunar objects and may also be useful as reference data for forthcoming
observational missions.

handling composite nulls in tandem with dependent features from arbitrary

statistics. Finally, we analyze the loss in FDR when the original knockoff

exchange between the heated ions and the Compton-cooled electrons. As a result,
most electrons are kept at a low temperature in Compton equilibrium with
radiation, and so thermal Comptonization cannot reach photon energies $\sim
100$ keV observed from accreting black holes. Nevertheless, magnetic
reconnection efficiently generates $\sim 100$ keV photons because of mildly
relativistic bulk motions of the plasmoid chain formed in the reconnection
layer. Comptonization by the plasmoid motions dominates the radiative output
and controls the peak of the radiation spectrum $E_{\rm pk}$. We find $E_{\rm

can be applied to arbitrary graphs, given a positive semi definite variation
operator, while using arbitrary vertex partitions for downsampling. The
proposed generalized filter banks (GFBs) also satisfy several desirable
properties including perfect reconstruction and critical sampling, while having
efficient implementations. Our results generalize previous approaches that were
only valid for the normalized Laplacian of bipartite graphs. Our approach is
based on novel graph Fourier transforms (GFTs) given by the generalized
eigenvectors of the variation operator. These GFTs are orthogonal in an
alternative inner product space which depends on the downsampling and variation
operators. Our key theoretical contribution is showing that the spectral
folding property of the normalized Laplacian of bipartite graphs, at the core
of bipartite filter bank theory, can be generalized for the proposed GFT if the
inner product matrix is chosen properly. In addition, we study vertex domain
and spectral domain properties of GFBs and illustrate their probabilistic
interpretation using Gaussian graphical models. While GFBs can be defined given
any choice of a vertex partition for downsampling, we propose an algorithm to
optimize these partitions with a criterion that favors balanced partitions with
large graph cuts, which are shown to lead to efficient and stable GFB
implementations. Our numerical experiments show that partition-optimized GFBs
can be implemented efficiently on 3D point clouds with hundreds of thousands of
points (nodes), while also improving the color signal representation quality
over competing state-of-the-art approaches.

distinct stages: In the first stage, the particle number and the entropy at low

public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) in which portions of the grid are
de-energized to mitigate the risk of ignition. The decision to call a PSPS must
balance reducing ignition risks and the negative impact of service
interruptions. In this work, we consider three PSPS scheduling scenarios, which
we model as dynamic programs. In the first two scenarios, we assume that N
PSPSs are budgeted as part of the investment strategy. In the first scenario, a
penalty is incurred for each PSPS declared past the Nth event. In the second,
we assume that some costs can be recovered if the number of PSPSs is below $N$
while still being subject to a penalty if above N. In the third, the system
operator wants to minimize the number of PSPS such that the total expected cost
is below a threshold. We provide optimal or asymptotically optimal policies for
each case, the first two of which have closed-form expressions. Lastly, we
establish the applicability of the first PSPS model's policy to critical-peak
pricing, and obtain an optimal scheduling policy to reduce the peak demand

account for in a broadly classical framework. For instance, while a sentence of
the form $p\wedge\Diamond\neg p$ ('$p$, but it might be that not $p$') appears
to be a contradiction, $\Diamond\neg p$ does not entail $\neg p$, which would
follow in classical logic. Likewise, the classical laws of distributivity and
disjunctive syllogism fail for epistemic modals. Existing attempts to account
for these facts generally either under- or over-correct. Some predict that
$p\wedge\Diamond\neg p$, a so-called epistemic contradiction, is a
contradiction only in an etiolated sense, under a notion of entailment that
does not always allow us to replace $p\wedge\Diamond\neg p$ with a
contradiction; these theories underpredict the infelicity of embedded epistemic
contradictions. Other theories savage classical logic, eliminating not just
rules that intuitively fail but also rules like non-contradiction, excluded
middle, De Morgan's laws, and disjunction introduction, which intuitively
remain valid for epistemic modals. In this paper, we aim for a middle ground,
developing a semantics and logic for epistemic modals that makes epistemic
contradictions genuine contradictions and that invalidates distributivity and
disjunctive syllogism but that otherwise preserves classical laws that
intuitively remain valid. We start with an algebraic semantics, based on
ortholattices instead of Boolean algebras, and then propose a more concrete
possibility semantics, based on partial possibilities related by compatibility.
Both semantics yield the same consequence relation, which we axiomatize. We
then show how to lift an arbitrary possible worlds model for a non-modal
language to a possibility model for a language with epistemic modals.

the situation when $d$ is large compared to $n$ but the covariance matrix
$\Sigma$ of interest has (exactly or approximately) low rank. We assume that
the given sample is (a) $\epsilon$-adversarially corrupted, meaning that
$\epsilon$ fraction of the observations could have been replaced by arbitrary
vectors, or that (b) the sample is i.i.d. but the underlying distribution is
heavy-tailed, meaning that the norm of $Y$ possesses only finite fourth
moments. We propose an estimator that is adaptive to the potential low-rank
structure of the covariance matrix as well as to the proportion of contaminated
data, and admits tight deviation guarantees despite rather weak assumptions on
the underlying distribution. Finally, we discuss the algorithms that allow to
approximate the proposed estimator in a numerically efficient way.

encryption schemes based on fractional integral transform. As the fractional
integral transforms have evolved through their applications from optical signal
processing to digital signal and digital image processing over the decades. In
this article, we have adopted an architecture and corresponding domain-based
taxonomy to classify various existing schemes in the literature. The schemes
are classified according to the implementation platform, that may be an optical

Instead, we propose a label-free method that learns to enforce the geometric

components: differentiable shape deformation, registration, and rendering. In
particular, shape deformation and registration are applied to the template mesh

renderer is then deployed to enforce geometric consistency between point clouds
lifted from the rendered depth and the observed scene for self-supervision. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and find that our approach
outperforms the simple traditional baseline by large margins while being
competitive with some fully-supervised approaches.

soft label probability of source-side words to zero. Simple yet effective, MLS
manages to better integrate label smoothing with vocabulary sharing. Our
extensive experiments show that MLS consistently yields improvement over
original label smoothing on different datasets, including bilingual and

also effectively capture class-specific attention for more discriminative
object localization by learning multiple class tokens within the transformer.
To this end, we propose a Multi-class Token Transformer, termed as MCTformer,
which uses multiple class tokens to learn interactions between the class tokens
and the patch tokens. The proposed MCTformer can successfully produce
class-discriminative object localization maps from class-to-patch attentions
corresponding to different class tokens. We also propose to use a patch-level
pairwise affinity, which is extracted from the patch-to-patch transformer
attention, to further refine the localization maps. Moreover, the proposed
framework is shown to fully complement the Class Activation Mapping (CAM)

clusters (GCs). The origin of G2 stars is unclear. We uncover two empirical
dependencies between GC characteristics, which can be explained by the
formation of G2 Main-Sequence (MS) stars due to collision\merging of their
primordial counterparts (G1). A similar genesis of both G2 stars and peculiar
objects like LMXBs and millisecond pulsars is also implied. Indeed, we find a
significant (at a confidence level > 99,9%) anti-correlation between the
fraction of G1 red giants ($N_{G1}/N_{tot}$) and stellar encounter rates among
51 GCs. Moreover, a Milky Way-like initial mass function (IMF) requires at
least ~50% of MS stars located in the mass range [0.1-0.5] $M\odot$. Unlike
cluster mass loss, stellar collisions\merging retain these G1 stars by
converting them into more massive G2 ones, with mainly M_ms > 0.5 $M\odot$.
This process coupled with a decreasing relative mass loss with increasing GC
masses implies a smaller ($N_{G1}/N_{tot}$) in more massive GCs with a
shallower present day MF. From data for 35 GCs, we find that such an
anti-correlation is significant at 98.3% confidence level (Spearman's
correlation) for 12 most massive GCs ($M_{GC} > 10^{5.3}$) and it is at a
confidence level of 89% for the 12 least massive GCs ($M_{GC} < 10^{5.1}

chromosome straightening remains challenging, due to the unavailability of

generator learns the motion representation of chromosomes for straightening.
With the help of the ViT-Patch discriminator, the straightened chromosomes
retain more shape and banding pattern details. The experimental results show
that the proposed method achieves better performance on Fr\'echet Inception

for measuring states going through high-lost channels. They are particularly
prominent in quantum key distribution(QKD), which could be the most significant
application in quantum information theory. In recent years, QKD distance
improved dramatically but is still restricted because the bit error rate(QBER)
caused by SPD dark counts will be out of control as the distance increases. If
this problem can be solved, QKD can be implemented over arbitrarily long
distances. However, previous solutions often result in impractical requirements
such as superconductors while they can only reduce the dark count rate to
finite low levels. Here we present a scheme with today's technologies only,
solving SPD problems. By employing a copy strategy, our scheme demonstrates
that imperfect detectors can provide nearly perfect results, namely the QBER
caused by dark counts can be reduced to arbitrarily low while detective
efficiency can be improved to arbitrarily high. As a consequence, QKD distance
is not limited by the imperfect SPD anymore and can be improved from hundreds
of kilometers to thousands without high-technology detectors. Furthermore,
similar schemes can be applied for reducing measurement errors or improving the
performance of sources. Finally, it is worth noting that although the paper is
mainly discussed in the context of QKD, our scheme is an independent scheme
that could be employed in other protocols wherever SPD are employed. \\

web applications and cloud. Users can invoke such services according to the
specification of their application interfaces, namely RESTful APIs. Existing
approaches for fuzzing RESTful APIs are generally based on classic
API-dependency graphs. However, such dependencies are inefficient for REST
services due to the explosion of dependencies among APIs. In this paper, we
propose a novel tree-based approach that can better capture the essential
dependencies and largely improve the efficiency of RESTful API fuzzing. In
particular, the hierarchical information of the endpoints across multiple APIs
enables us to construct an API tree, and the relationships of tree nodes can
indicate the priority of resource dependencies, \textit{e.g.,} it's more likely
that a node depends on its parent node rather than its offspring or siblings.
In the evaluation part, we first confirm that such a tree-based approach is
more efficient than traditional graph-based approaches. We then apply our tool
to fuzz two real-world RESTful services and compare the performance with two
state-of-the-art tools, EvoMaster and RESTler. Our results show that foREST can
improve the code coverage in all experiments, ranging from 11.5\% to 82.5\%.

Dual-task Pose Transformer Network (DPTN), which introduces an auxiliary task

the performance of PGPIG. The DPTN is of a Siamese structure, containing a

rigourously derive a weak stationarity system for local minima. By combining

the ground state to the $2^3 S$ level. If implemented, these improvements
promise to result in the time required to measure an acceleration of 9.1

Bogoliubov approximation, we explicitly derive analytic expressions of the
current-current response functions in the plane-wave and zero-momentum phases,
from which we extract the superfluid density in the limits of long wavelength
and zero frequency. At zero temperature, we check that the resultant superfluid
density agrees exactly with our previous analytic prediction obtained from a
phase-twist approach. Both results also satisfy a generalized Josephson
relation in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. At finite temperature, we find
a significant non-monotonic temperature dependence of superfluid density near
the transition from the plane-wave phase to the zero-momentum phase. We show
that this non-trivial behavior might be understood from the sound velocity,
which has a similar temperature dependence. The non-monotonic temperature
dependence is also shared by Landau critical velocity, above which the
spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas loses its superfluidity. Our results would be
useful for further theoretical and experimental studies of superfluidity in
exotic spin-orbit coupled quantum gases.

spectral index of $\alpha = -0.52\pm0.18$ ($S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$). The radio
source is unresolved in all VLA bands with an upper limit to the size of
$0.2^{\prime \prime}$ (i.e., $\sim$ 1.1 kpc) at 10 GHz. We find variability in
the flux density (increase by $\sim 33\%$) and the spectral index (steepened)

density observed in the same year is 1.5 times that detected with the Very Long

that half of the radio emission from J0100+2802 comes from a compact core

diffuse and resolved out in the VLBA observations. The diffuse emission is four
times brighter than that would be expected if driven by star formation. We

problem in cheminformatics and drug discovery. Recently, significant progress
has been achieved with machine learning approaches, especially with deep
generative models. Inspired by the diffusion process in classical
non-equilibrium thermodynamics where heated particles will diffuse from
original states to a noise distribution, in this paper, we propose a novel
generative model named GeoDiff for molecular conformation prediction. GeoDiff
treats each atom as a particle and learns to directly reverse the diffusion
process (i.e., transforming from a noise distribution to stable conformations)
as a Markov chain. Modeling such a generation process is however very
challenging as the likelihood of conformations should be roto-translational
invariant. We theoretically show that Markov chains evolving with equivariant
Markov kernels can induce an invariant distribution by design, and further
propose building blocks for the Markov kernels to preserve the desirable
equivariance property. The whole framework can be efficiently trained in an
end-to-end fashion by optimizing a weighted variational lower bound to the
(conditional) likelihood. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GeoDiff
is superior or comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially
on large molecules.

theoretical and numerical analysis. The Boltzmann equation, while possessing a
wider applicability than hydrodynamic equations, requires significantly more
computational resources due to the increased degrees of freedom in the model.
The success of a hybrid fluid-kinetic flow solver for the study of multi-scale
flows relies on accurate prediction of flow regimes. In this paper, we draw on
binary classification in machine learning and propose the first neural network
classifier to detect near-equilibrium and non-equilibrium flow regimes based on
local flow conditions. Compared with classical semi-empirical criteria of
continuum breakdown, the current method provides a data-driven alternative
where the parameterized implicit function is trained by solutions of the
Boltzmann equation. The ground-truth labels are derived rigorously from the
deviation of particle distribution functions and the approximations based on
the Chapman-Enskog ansatz. Therefore, no tunable parameter is needed in the
criterion. Following the entropy closure of the Boltzmann moment system, a data
generation strategy is developed to produce training and test sets. Numerical
analysis shows its superiority over simulation-based samplings. A hybrid
Boltzmann-Navier-Stokes flow solver is built correspondingly with adaptive
partition of local flow regimes. Numerical experiments including
one-dimensional Riemann problem, shear flow layer and hypersonic flow around
circular cylinder are presented to validate the current scheme for simulating
cross-scale and non-equilibrium flow physics. The quantitative comparison with
a semi-empirical criterion and benchmark results demonstrates the capability of
the current neural classifier to accurately predict continuum breakdown.

ALMA band 7 observations of the dust and ice trap in the protoplanetary disk

determined column densities for the detected molecules and upper limits on

column densities of CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO with respect to methanol (CH3OH) are of
order unity, indicating unusually high abundances of these species compared to
other environments. Alternatively, the 12CH3OH emission is optically thick and
beam diluted, implying a higher CH3OH column density and a smaller emitting
area than originally thought. The presence of these complex molecules can be
explained by thermal ice sublimation, where the dust cavity edge is heated by
irradiation and the full volatile ice content is observable in the gas phase.
This work confirms the presence of oxygen-bearing molecules more complex than

of freedom through serendipity techniques for polytopal methods compatible with

transfer of the homological and analytical properties from one complex to the

with one of them being a reduced version of the other, such as occurring when
applying serendipity techniques to numerical methods. We then use this
framework as an overarching blueprint to design a serendipity DDR complex.
Thanks to the combined use of higher-order reconstructions and serendipity,
this complex compares favorably in terms of degrees of freedom (DOF) count to
all the other polytopal methods previously introduced and also to finite
elements on certain element geometries. The gain resulting from such a
reduction in the number of DOFs is numerically evaluated on two model problems:
a magnetostatic model, and the Stokes equations.

either applied in the time-domain or in the frequency-domain. In our approach,
we propose a Siamese-Unet architecture that uses both representations. The
Siamese encoders are applied in the frequency-domain to infer the embedding of
the noisy and reference spectra, respectively. The concatenated representations
are then fed into the decoder to estimate the real and imaginary components of
the desired speaker, which are then inverse-transformed to the time-domain. The
model is trained with the Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR)
loss to exploit the time-domain information. The time-domain loss is also
regularized with frequency-domain loss to preserve the speech patterns.
Experimental results demonstrate that the unified approach is not only very
easy to train, but also provides superior results as compared with

particle ejects from a primary, reaches $n$ maxima in the distance with respect
to it and finally collides with the primary. Such EC orbits have a value of the
Jacobi constant of the form $C=3\mu +Ln^{2/3}(1-\mu)^{2/3}$, where $L>0$ is big
enough but independent of $\mu$ and $n$. In order to prove this optimal result,
we consider Levi-Civita's transformation to regularize the collision with one
primary and a perturbative approach using an ad hoc small parameter once a
suitable scale in the configuration plane and time has previously been applied.
This result improves a previous work where the existence of the $n$-EC orbits
was stated when the mass parameter $\mu>0$ was small enough. In this paper, any
possible value of $\mu\in (0,1)$ and $n\ge 1$ is considered. Moreover, for
decreasing values of $C$, there appear some bifurcations which are first
numerically investigated and afterwards explicit expressions for the

detailed analysis of the existence of $n$-EC orbits when $\mu \to 1$ is also

losses of different target tokens based on specific statistical metrics (e.g.,
token frequency or mutual information). Given that standard translation models
make predictions on the condition of previous target contexts, we argue that
the above statistical metrics ignore target context information and may assign
inappropriate weights to target tokens. While one possible solution is to
directly take target contexts into these statistical metrics, the
target-context-aware statistical computing is extremely expensive, and the
corresponding storage overhead is unrealistic. To solve the above issues, we
propose a target-context-aware metric, named conditional bilingual mutual
information (CBMI), which makes it feasible to supplement target context
information for statistical metrics. Particularly, our CBMI can be formalized
as the log quotient of the translation model probability and language model
probability by decomposing the conditional joint distribution. Thus CBMI can be
efficiently calculated during model training without any pre-specific
statistical calculations and large storage overhead. Furthermore, we propose an
effective adaptive training approach based on both the token- and
sentence-level CBMI. Experimental results on WMT14 English-German and WMT19

Then we compute the loss function of the similarity between the simulated

depth map in the same view. The three types of images, as a dataset, are used
to obtain the precise PSF. Our experiments on standard planes and actual

In this work, we propose a hybrid of proximal gradient method and subspace
regularized Newton method, named HpgSRN. Unlike existing global convergent
results for (regularized) Newton methods, the whole iterate sequence produced
by HpgSRN is proved to have a finite length and converge to an $L$-type
stationary point under a mild curve-ratio condition and the
Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property of the cost function, which does linearly if
further a Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property of exponent $1/2$ holds. Moreover, a
superlinear convergence rate for the iterate sequence is also achieved under an
additional local error bound condition. Our convergence results do not require
the isolatedness and strict local minimum properties of the $L$-stationary
point. Numerical comparisons with ZeroFPR, a hybrid of proximal gradient method

considerably more efficient than generic FE implementations. The efficiency of
our scheme follows from a preconditioned well-scaled reformulation allowing for
the use of the conjugate gradient or similar iterative solvers. The
geometrically-optimal preconditioner -- a discretized Green's function of a
periodic homogeneous reference problem -- has a block-diagonal structure in the
Fourier space which permits its efficient inversion using the fast Fourier
transform (FFT) techniques for generic regular meshes. This implies that the
scheme scales as $\mathcal{O}(n \log(n))$ like FFT, rendering it equivalent to
spectral solvers in terms of computational efficiency. However, in contrast to
classical spectral solvers, the proposed scheme works with FE shape functions
with local supports and is free of the Fourier ringing phenomenon. We showcase
that the scheme achieves the number of iterations that are almost independent
of spatial discretisation and scales mildly with the phase contrast.
Additionally, we discuss the equivalence between our displacement-based scheme

superluminal radio jet, similar to those observed in active galactic nuclei
with a supermassive black hole at the centre. It has been proposed that the
radio emission in GRS 1915+105 is fed by instabilities in the accretion disc by
which the inner parts of the accretion flow is ejected in the jet. Here we show
that there is a significant correlation between: (i) the radio flux, coming
from the jet, and the flux of the iron emission line, coming from the disc and,
(ii) the temperature of the corona that produces the high-energy part of the
X-ray spectrum via inverse Compton scattering and the amplitude of a
high-frequency variability component coming from the innermost part of the
accretion flow. At the same time, the radio flux and the flux of the iron line
are strongly anti-correlated with the temperature of the X-ray corona and the
amplitude of the high-frequency variability component. These correlations
persist over ~10 years, despite the highly variable X-ray and radio properties
of the source in that period. Our findings provide, for the first time,
incontrovertible evidence that the energy that powers this black-hole system
can be directed either to the X-ray corona or the jet. When this energy is used
to power the corona, raising its temperature, there is less energy left to fuel
the jet and the radio flux drops, and vice versa. These facts, plus the
modelling of the variability in this source show conclusively that in GRS
1915+105 the X-ray corona morphs into the jet.

video semantically according to a given sentence query. Most previous works
focus on learning frame-level features of each whole frame in the entire video,
and directly match them with the textual information. Such frame-level feature
extraction leads to the obstacles of these methods in distinguishing ambiguous
video frames with complicated contents and subtle appearance differences, thus
limiting their performance. In order to differentiate fine-grained appearance
similarities among consecutive frames, some state-of-the-art methods
additionally employ a detection model like Faster R-CNN to obtain detailed
object-level features in each frame for filtering out the redundant background
contents. However, these methods suffer from missing motion analysis since the
object detection module in Faster R-CNN lacks temporal modeling. To alleviate
the above limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel Motion- and
Appearance-guided 3D Semantic Reasoning Network (MA3SRN), which incorporates
optical-flow-guided motion-aware, detection-based appearance-aware, and
3D-aware object-level features to better reason the spatial-temporal object
relations for accurately modelling the activity among consecutive frames.
Specifically, we first develop three individual branches for motion,
appearance, and 3D encoding separately to learn fine-grained motion-guided,
appearance-guided, and 3D-aware object features, respectively. Then, both
motion and appearance information from corresponding branches are associated to
enhance the 3D-aware features for the final precise grounding. Extensive
experiments on three challenging datasets (ActivityNet Caption, Charades-STA
and TACoS) demonstrate that the proposed MA3SRN model achieves a new
state-of-the-art.

quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a
general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree,

particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost
$O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that
can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$.
  Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a
similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the
""guessing complexity"" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing
complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by
Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory.
This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing
complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure.
We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the
complete binary AND-OR tree.
  Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for
Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an
assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of
changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective
value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting
scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and
argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for
which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and

oscillatory motions are produced by the periodic deformation of an elongated
skyrmion. Through micromagnetic simulations, we find that the oscillation
frequency depends on the driving current, the damping constant as well as the
characteristics of pinning sites. This nonlinear response to direct current
turns out to be universal and can also appear in the case of antiskyrmions,
skyrmioniums and domain walls. Furthermore, the elongated skyrmion possesses a

segments. Although sometimes a connective exists in raw texts for conveying
relations, it is more often the cases that no connective exists in between two
text segments but some implicit relation does exist in between them. The task
of implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) is to detect implicit
relation and classify its sense between two text segments without a connective.
Indeed, the IDRR task is important to diverse downstream natural language
processing tasks, such as text summarization, machine translation and so on.
This article provides a comprehensive and up-to-date survey for the IDRR task.
We first summarize the task definition and data sources widely used in the
field. We categorize the main solution approaches for the IDRR task from the
viewpoint of its development history. In each solution category, we present and
analyze the most representative methods, including their origins, ideas,
strengths and weaknesses. We also present performance comparisons for those

performs explicit and implicit reasoning over a key-value knowledge memory

module learns a dynamic knowledge representation and generates a

note that the energy spectrum raises as the number of dimensions increases. In
addition, the dependence of the energy spectra of the Deng-Fan potential and
its shifted potential on the reduced mass, screening parameter, equilibrium
bond length, rotational and vibrational quantum numbers is illustrated. To
validate our findings, we estimate the energy levels of the Deng-Fan potential
and shifted Deng-Fan potential at the classical case for various diatomic
molecules and found that they are entirely compatible with earlier studies.

control outcomes on their own, without the intervention of a human operator.
Autonomic computing fundamentals have been substantially influenced by those of
control theory for closed and open-loop systems. In practice, complex systems
may exhibit a number of concurrent and inter-dependent control loops. Despite
research into autonomic models for managing computer resources, ranging from
individual resources (e.g., web servers) to a resource ensemble (e.g., multiple
resources within a data center), research into integrating Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve resource autonomy and
performance at scale continues to be a fundamental challenge. The integration
of AI/ML to achieve such autonomic and self-management of systems can be
achieved at different levels of granularity, from full to human-in-the-loop
automation. In this article, leading academics, researchers, practitioners,
engineers, and scientists in the fields of cloud computing, AI/ML, and quantum
computing join to discuss current research and potential future directions for
these fields. Further, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging
AI and ML in next generation computing for emerging computing paradigms,
including cloud, fog, edge, serverless and quantum computing environments.

providing multiple cases to demonstrate its use. Four modules are used in any
simulation: (1) the physical grid, (2) market mechanisms, (3) a set of
trainable agents which interact with the former two modules, and (4)
environment module that connects and coordinates the above three. We provide
templates for each of those four, but they are easily interchangeable with

DI water with different feeding gases were diagnosed and the effects of three
solutions on the breast cancer cells and gastric cancer cells were also
recorded. Our findings show that DI water treated by CAP with He feeding gas
has a much stronger effect on apoptosis in precultured breast cancer cells and
gastric cancer cells. These results are attributed to the higher concentration
of ROS generated in CAP-activated DI water using He as feeding gas.

Fokker-Planck equation demonstrates different modes of the probability flow.
These modes include creeping in a single direction, direction reversal and
oscillating in both directions in the coordinate space. By varying the
roughness and noise intensity, the flow can transform between the modes. The
correlation between the noise and space indicates that the noise can maintain
the oscillation of the modes and prolong the transient time to the steady state
at which the flow tends to be zero.

Chambers (TPCs) using various gas mixtures has applications in various nuclear

physics is study of nuclear reactions involving Ne isotopes. These reactions
can be studied using Ne-based gas mixtures at low pressures in TPCs used as
active targets for radioactive beams. We report on the low-pressure operation
of THGEMs in Ne + H2 gas mixtures. We show that, since the Ne+H2 forms a
Penning pair, higher gains with THGEMs are achievable compared to pure neon
gas. Moreover, H2 acts as a quench gas allowing for higher THGEMs voltages
while producing minimal background in reactions such as fusion compared to
carbon-based neon gas mixtures. Detailed electron transport and amplification
simulations have been performed and they qualitatively agree with the increased
gain H2 provides in the Ne:H2 mixture. The higher THGEM gains that are achieved
with a Ne:H2 mixture will enhance the study of Ne-based reactions in
active-target detectors that have high-granularity pad planes, leading to
higher spatial resolution heavy-ion track data.

  Guarantee via Deep Reinforcement Learning","5 pages, 5 figures, accepted by VTC2022-Spring",,,,"cs.NI cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network slicing is a critical driver for guaranteeing the diverse service
level agreements (SLA) in 5G and future networks. Recently, deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been widely utilized for resource allocation in network
slicing. However, existing related works do not consider the performance loss
associated with the initial exploration phase of DRL. This paper proposes a new
performance-guaranteed slicing strategy with a soft and hard hybrid slicing
setting. Mainly, a common slice setting is applied to guarantee slices' SLA
when training the neural network. Moreover, the resource of the common slice
tends to precisely redistribute to slices with the training of DRL until it
converges. Furthermore, experiment results confirm the effectiveness of our
proposed slicing framework: the slices' SLA of the training phase can be
guaranteed, and the proposed algorithm can achieve the near-optimal performance
in terms of the SLA satisfaction ratio, isolation degree and spectrum
maximization after convergence.

  Model","18 pages",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers common consumption-based asset pricing model and derives
approximations of the basic pricing equation that describes mutual dependence
of the mean price ""to-day"", mean payoff ""next-day"", price and payoff volatility
and impact of the price and payoff autocorrelations. The deep conjunction of
the consumption-based model with other modifications of asset pricing as ICAPM,
APM and etc. (Cochrane, 2001) causes that our results can be derived in other
versions of CAPM. We introduce the market-based price averaging and discuss the
origin of its distinctions from the common frequency-based price probability.
The market-based price statistical moments, price volatility and
autocorrelation are determined by statistical moments of the random market
trade value and volume. Distinctions between the frequency-based and the
market-based approaches to price averaging cause different assessment of the
price volatility and autocorrelation and result in different treatment of the
price-volume relations in particular. The market-based price averaging provides
direct dependence of the price statistical moments on the market trade value
and volume statistical moments. It establishes a unified ground for description
of financial markets but uncovers tough complexity. The usage of the
frequency-based or proposed market-based price averaging is completely
determined by agent's preferences, beliefs and habits. The collision between
'rational' market-based approach and ""soulful"" or ""home-felt"" frequency-based
approach to price averaging creates significant challenge for financial theory.
