the hype around quantum computing, its incomprehensible power, and its
implications. The advancement in quantum computing has the potential to
revolutionize our daily lives, but it can also completely break down the
Internet as we know it. Mathematicians and physicists have developed algorithms
based on quantum computing, which can change the Internet security paradigm.
This article discusses quantum computing key concepts, with a special focus on
quantum Internet, quantum key distribution, and related challenges.

computer networks and the hosts within them. Machine learning (ML) nowadays
predominantly serves as the basis for NIDS decision making, where models are
tuned to reduce false alarms, increase detection rates, and detect known and
unknown attacks. At the same time, ML models have been found to be vulnerable
to adversarial examples that undermine the downstream task. In this work, we
ask the practical question of whether real-world ML-based NIDS can be
circumvented by crafted adversarial flows, and if so, how can they be created.
We develop the generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attack algorithm
NIDSGAN and evaluate its effectiveness against realistic ML-based NIDS. Two
main challenges arise for generating adversarial network traffic flows: (1) the
network features must obey the constraints of the domain (i.e., represent
realistic network behavior), and (2) the adversary must learn the decision
behavior of the target NIDS without knowing its model internals (e.g.,
architecture and meta-parameters) and training data. Despite these challenges,
the NIDSGAN algorithm generates highly realistic adversarial traffic flows that
evade ML-based NIDS. We evaluate our attack algorithm against two
state-of-the-art DNN-based NIDS in whitebox, blackbox, and restricted-blackbox
threat models and achieve success rates which are on average 99%, 85%, and 70%,
respectively. We also show that our attack algorithm can evade NIDS based on
classical ML models including logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and
KNNs, with a success rate of 70% on average. Our results demonstrate that
deploying ML-based NIDS without careful defensive strategies against
adversarial flows may (and arguably likely will) lead to future compromises.

has been mainly focused on novel architectures of STR models. However, training
protocol (i.e., settings of the hyper-parameters involved in the training of
STR models), which plays an equally important role in successfully training a
good STR model, is under-explored for scene text recognition. In this work, we
attempt to improve the accuracy of existing STR models by searching for optimal

algorithm, based on a newly designed search space and an efficient search
algorithm using evolutionary optimization and proxy tasks. Experimental results
show that our searched training protocol can improve the recognition accuracy
of mainstream STR models by 2.7%~3.9%. In particular, with the searched

various vision tasks, including image super-resolution (SR), by exploiting the
self-attention (SA) for feature extraction. However, the computation of SA in
most existing transformer based models is very expensive, while some employed
operations may be redundant for the SR task. This limits the range of SA
computation and consequently the SR performance. In this work, we propose an
efficient long-range attention network (ELAN) for image SR. Specifically, we
first employ shift convolution (shift-conv) to effectively extract the image
local structural information while maintaining the same level of complexity as
1x1 convolution, then propose a group-wise multi-scale self-attention (GMSA)
module, which calculates SA on non-overlapped groups of features using
different window sizes to exploit the long-range image dependency. A highly
efficient long-range attention block (ELAB) is then built by simply cascading
two shift-conv with a GMSA module, which is further accelerated by using a
shared attention mechanism. Without bells and whistles, our ELAN follows a
fairly simple design by sequentially cascading the ELABs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ELAN obtains even better results against the transformer-based
SR models but with significantly less complexity. The source code can be found

method for estimating luminosity functions (LFs). This new upgrade further
extend the application scope of our KDE method, making it a very flexible
approach which is suitable to deal with most of bivariate LF calculation
problems. From the mathematical point of view, usually the LF calculation can
be abstracted as a density estimation problem in the bounded domain of
$\{Z_1<z<Z_2,~ L>f_{\mathrm{lim}}(z) \}$. We use the transformation-reflection
KDE method ($\hat{\phi}$) to solve the problem, and introduce an approximate
method ($\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{1}}$) based on one-dimensional KDE to deal with
the small sample size case. In practical applications, the different versions
of LF estimators can be flexibly chosen according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test criterion. Based on 200 simulated samples, we find that for both cases of
dividing or not dividing redshift bins, especially for the latter, our method
performs significantly better than the traditional binning method
$\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{bin}}$. Moreover, with the increase of sample size $n$,
our LF estimator converges to the true LF remarkably faster than
$\hat{\phi}_{\mathrm{bin}}$. To implement our method, we have developed a
public, open-source Python Toolkit, called \texttt{kdeLF}. With the support of
\texttt{kdeLF}, our KDE method is expected to be a competitive alternative to
existing nonparametric estimators, due to its high accuracy and excellent
stability. \texttt{kdeLF} is available at

Gaussian process, bootstrap methodology or even more sophisticated model like
quantile regression. The number of models that it is possible to build by

former is for cases where one has a prior and the latter is for cases where one
has no prior. But the prior/no-prior classification isn't exhaustive, and most
real-world applications fit somewhere in between these two extremes. That
neither of the two dominant schools of thought are suited for these
applications creates confusion and slows progress. A key observation here is
that ``no prior information'' actually means no prior distribution can be ruled
out, so the classically-frequentist context is best characterized as every
prior. From this perspective, it's now clear that there's an entire spectrum of
contexts depending on what, if any, partial prior information is available,
with Bayesian (one prior) and frequentist (every prior) on opposite extremes.
This paper ties the two frameworks together by formally treating those cases
where only partial prior information is available using the theory of imprecise
probability. The end result is a unified framework of (imprecise-probabilistic)
statistical inference with a new validity condition that implies both
frequentist-style error rate control for derived procedures and Bayesian-style
coherence properties, relative to the given partial prior information. This new
theory contains both the Bayesian and frequentist frameworks as special cases,
since they're both valid in this new sense relative to their respective partial
priors. Different constructions of these valid inferential models are
considered, and compared based on their efficiency.

on the HNL lifetime: direct searches for the prompt decay of HNLs with a short
lifetime and displaced vertex searches for long-lived ones. After identifying
the most promising signals and the corresponding backgrounds, we perform a
detailed simulation to estimate the sensitivity of the EIC to HNLs, accounting
for detector thresholds, resolutions, and geometric acceptance. We derive
projections for the EIC reach to the HNL squared mixing angle as a function of
the HNL mass under the electron flavor mixing dominance hypothesis. Our
findings indicate that the EIC can provide comparable sensitivity to the
existing constraints for the prompt searches, while the displaced vertex
searches can cover substantial new ground for HNLs in the 1-10 GeV mass range.
Our proposed strategies are generally applicable to other new physics scenarios
as well and motivate additional phenomenological exploration and dedicated
future searches at the EIC.

oscillates at a common frequency. Upon completing an oscillation, an agent
generates a Bernoulli random variable to decide whether it sends pulses to all
of its out-neighbors or it stays quiet. Upon receiving a pulse, an agent resets
its state by following a binary phase update rule. We show that such an
algorithm can guarantee global synchronization of the agents almost surely as
long as the underlying information flow topology is a rooted directed graph.
The proof of the result relies on the use of a stochastic hybrid dynamical
system approach. Toward the end of the paper, we present numerical
demonstrations for the validity of the result and, also, numerical studies

and on the nuclear modification factor. We find that overall memory slows down
the momentum evolution of heavy quarks: in fact, transverse momentum broadening
and the formation of $R_{AA}$ are slowed down by memory and the thermalization
time of the heavy quarks become larger. The potential impact on other
observables is discussed briefly.

  on the infinite line","version 2 adds a probabilistic application of the main result",,,,"math.PR math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents a novel method for computing certain particle locations
in the multi-species $q$-TAZRP (totally asymmetric zero range process). The
method is based on a decomposition of the process into its discrete-time
embedded Markov chain, which is described more generally as a monotone process
on a graded partially ordered set; and an independent family of exponential
random variables. A further ingredient is explicit contour integral formulas
for the transition probabilities of the $q$-TAZRP. The main result of this
method is a shift invariance for the multi-species $q$-TAZRP on the infinite
line.
  By a previously known Markov duality result, these particle locations are the
same as joint $q$-moments. One particular special case is that for step initial
conditions, ordered multi-point joint $q$-moments of the $n$-species $q$-TAZRP
match the $n$-point joint $q$-moments of the single-species $q$-TAZRP. Thus, we
conjecture that the Airy$_2$ process describes the joint multi-point
fluctuations of multi-species $q$-TAZRP.
  As a probabilistic application of this result, we find explicit contour
integral formulas for the joint $q$-moments of the multi-species $q$-TAZRP in
the diffusive scaling regime.

with nanophotonic devices promises novel nanoscale sensing and quantum optical
functionalities. But precise optical control of atomic states in these devices
is challenged by the spatially varying light-atom coupling strength, generic to
nanophotonic. We demonstrate numerically that despite the inhomogenuity,
composite picosecond optical pulses with optimally tailored phases are able to
evanescently control the atomic electric dipole transitions nearly perfectly,
with $f>99\%$ fidelity across large enough volumes for {\it e.g.} controlling
cold atoms confined in near-field optical lattices. Our proposal is followed by
a proof-of-principle demonstration with a $^{85}$Rb vapor -- optical nanofiber
interface, where the excitation by an $N=3$ sequence of guided picosecond D1
control reduces the absorption of a co-guided nanosecond D2 probe by up to
$\sim70\%$. The close-to-ideal performance is corroborated by comparing the
absorption data across the parameter space with first-principle modeling of the
mesoscopic atomic vapor response. Extension of the composite technique to
$N\geq 5$ appears highly feasible to support arbitrary local control of atomic
dipoles with exquisite precision. This unprecedented ability would allow
error-resilient atomic spectroscopy and open up novel nonlinear quantum optical
research with atom-nanophotonic interfaces.

paper, we demonstrate that using a few large convolutional kernels instead of a
stack of small kernels could be a more powerful paradigm. We suggested five
guidelines, e.g., applying re-parameterized large depth-wise convolutions, to
design efficient high-performance large-kernel CNNs. Following the guidelines,
we propose RepLKNet, a pure CNN architecture whose kernel size is as large as
31x31, in contrast to commonly used 3x3. RepLKNet greatly closes the
performance gap between CNNs and ViTs, e.g., achieving comparable or superior
results than Swin Transformer on ImageNet and a few typical downstream tasks,
with lower latency. RepLKNet also shows nice scalability to big data and large
models, obtaining 87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and 56.0% mIoU on ADE20K,
which is very competitive among the state-of-the-arts with similar model sizes.
Our study further reveals that, in contrast to small-kernel CNNs, large-kernel
CNNs have much larger effective receptive fields and higher shape bias rather
than texture bias. Code & models at

colonizing and even terraforming Venus despite the extreme conditions on the

centered around removing Venus's massive carbon dioxide atmosphere and
replacing it with a habitable environment. I review past proposals and propose
a new method for terraforming Venus by building an artificial surface in the
much more hospitable upper atmosphere where the temperature and pressure are
both Earth-like. Such a surface could be built with locally produced materials
and would float above the bulk of the atmosphere using nitrogen as a lifting
gas. This would allow the engineering of a breathable atmosphere above the
surface and would remove the need to import or export extreme amounts of mass,
except for comparatively modest quantities of water. The engineering,
logistical, and energy requirements of this method are surveyed. I find that
such a terraforming project could be completed in a minimum of 200 years in a
best-case scenario, comparable to other proposals, with significantly lower
resource costs.

loss functions and data from people who do not trust the server or other silos.
In this setting, each silo (e.g. hospital) must protect the privacy of each
person's data (e.g. patient's medical record), even if the server or other
silos act as adversarial eavesdroppers. To that end, we consider inter-silo
record-level (ISRL) differential privacy (DP), which requires silo $i$'s
communications to satisfy record/item-level DP. We give novel ISRL-DP
algorithms for FL with heterogeneous (non-i.i.d.) silo data and two classes of
Lipschitz continuous loss functions: First, we consider losses satisfying the
Proximal Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, which is an extension of the
classical PL condition to the constrained setting. Prior works only considered
unconstrained private optimization with Lipschitz PL loss, which rules out most
interesting PL losses such as strongly convex problems and linear/logistic
regression. However, by analyzing the proximal PL scenario, we permit these
losses and others (e.g. LASSO, some neural nets) which are Lipschitz on a
restricted parameter domain. Our algorithms nearly attain the optimal strongly
convex, homogeneous (i.i.d.) rate for ISRL-DP FL without assuming convexity or
i.i.d. data. Second, we give the first private algorithms for non-convex
non-smooth loss functions. Our utility bounds even improve on the
state-of-the-art bounds for smooth losses. We complement our upper bounds with
lower bounds. Additionally, we provide shuffle DP (SDP) algorithms that improve
over the state-of-the-art central DP algorithms under more practical trust
assumptions. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm has better accuracy
than baselines for most privacy levels.

Photon-multiplier luminescent solar concentrators (PM-LSCs) contain

have recently been experimentally demonstrated and hold promise to outcompete
traditional LSCs. However, we find that the thermodynamic limits of PM-LSCs are
different and are sometimes more extreme relative to traditional LSCs. As might
be expected, to achieve very high concentration factors a PM-LSC design must
also include a free energy change, analogous to the Stokes shift in traditional
LSCs. Notably, unlike LSCs, the maximum concentration ratio of a PM-LSC is
dependent on brightness of the incident photon field. For some brightnesses,
but equivalent energy loss, the PM-LSC has a greater maximum concentration
factor than that of the traditional LSC. We find that the thermodynamic
requirements to achieve highly concentrating PM-LSCs differ from traditional
LSCs. The new model gives insight into the limits of concentration of PM-LSCs

sound waves in media with positive dispersion, which is described in terms of
the three-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. The KP instability
of one-dimensional solitons in the long-wavelength limit is considered using
the expansion for the corresponding spectral problem. It is shown that the KP
instability also takes place for two-dimensional solitons in the framework of
the three-dimensional KP equation with positive dispersion. According to B.B.
Kadomtsev this instability belongs to the self-focusing type. The nonlinear
stage of this instability is a collapse. One of the collapse criteria is the
Hamiltonian unboundedness from below for a fixed momentum projection coinciding
with the $L_2$-norm. This fact follows from scaling transformations, leaving
this norm constant. For this reason, collapse can be represented as the process
of falling a particle to the center in a self-consistent unbounded potential.
It is shown that the radiation of waves from a region with a negative
Hamiltonian, due to its unboundedness from below, promotes the collapse of the
waves. This scenario was confirmed by numerical experiments
\cite{KuznetsovMusherShafarenko1983, KuznetsovMusher1986}. Two analytical
approaches to the study of collapse are presented: using the variational method
and the quasiclassical approximation. In contrast to the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE) with a focusing nonlinearity, a feature of the
quasiclassical approach to describing acoustic collapse is that this method is
proposed for the three-dimensional KP equation as a system with hydrodynamic
nonlinearity. Within the framework of the quasiclassical description, a family
of self-similar collapses is found.

solved in the real-time Heisenberg picture. In order to bridge this theoretical
gap and to understand on the same ground massive and massless quenches, we
study the problem of a gaussian field characterized by a coupling parameter K
within a strip and a different one K0 in the remaining two semi-infinite
planes. We give a fully analytical solution using the electrostatic analogy
with the problem of a dielectric material within a strip surrounded by an
infinite medium of different dielectric constant, and exploiting the method of
charge images. After analytic continuation, this solution allows us to obtain
all the correlation functions after the quench within a path integral approach
in imaginary time, thus recovering and generalizing the results in real time.
Furthermore, this imaginary-time approach establishes a remarkable connection
between the quench and the famous problem of the conductivity of a
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid coupled to two semi-infinite leads: the two are in
fact related by a rotation of the spacetime coordinates.

dominated universe to the late-time accelerated universe which is encoded in
the Newtonian gravitational constant as $G\rightarrow G_{eff}$. The modified
gravitational constant ($G_{eff}$) depends on the form of $f(R)$. The late-time
accelerated expansion affects the formation of large scale structures by
slowing down the growth of matter density. On the other hand, $f(R)$ increases
the growth rate of the matter density perturbations. We have found that the
source term in $f(R)$ background, $G_{eff}\Omega_m$ overcomes the accelerated
expansion and the effect of accelerated expansion suppresses the formation of
the large scale structures in the asymptotic future.

integrating Differential Dynamic Microscopy (OpTiDMM)-that simultaneously
imposes local strains, measures resistive forces, and analyzes the motion of
the surrounding polymers. Our measurements with blends of ring and linear
polymers (DNA) and their composites with stiff polymers (microtubules) uncover
a surprising resonant response, in which affine alignment, superdiffusivity,
and elastic memory are maximized when the strain rate is comparable to the
entanglement rate. Microtubules suppress this resonance, while substantially
increasing elastic force and memory, due to varying degrees to which the
polymers buildup, stretch and flow along the strain path, and configurationally
dissipate stress. More broadly, the rich multi-scale coupling of mechanics and
dynamics afforded by OpTiDDM, empowers its interdisciplinary use to elucidate
non-trivial phenomena that sculpt stress propagation dynamics-critical to
commercial applications and cell mechanics alike.

to a more nuanced way of thinking about the relativity of superposition in

new EV (27 GWh / 43 GW (DC) / 4.5 GW (AC)) by 34% in terms of battery energy.
System BSS prices increased significantly in 2022 and were estimated at 1,200

$d$-CLAW-VD is NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite graphs of maximum

manage the recourse cost vs. robustness trade-offs. More specifically, our
framework Probabilistically ROBust rEcourse (\texttt{PROBE}) lets users choose
the probability with which a recourse could get invalidated (recourse
invalidation rate) if small changes are made to the recourse i.e., the recourse
is implemented somewhat noisily. To this end, we propose a novel objective
function which simultaneously minimizes the gap between the achieved
(resulting) and desired recourse invalidation rates, minimizes recourse costs,
and also ensures that the resulting recourse achieves a positive model
prediction. We develop novel theoretical results to characterize the recourse
invalidation rates corresponding to any given instance w.r.t. different classes
of underlying models (e.g., linear models, tree based models etc.), and
leverage these results to efficiently optimize the proposed objective.
Experimental evaluation with multiple real world datasets demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed framework.

  phase fluctuations in a copper oxide","27 pages, 10 figures and 4 tables",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic anisotropy (or `nematicity') has been detected in all main
families of cuprate superconductors by a range of experimental techniques --
electronic Raman scattering, THz dichroism, thermal conductivity, torque
magnetometry, second-harmonic generation -- and was directly visualized by
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) spectroscopy. Using angle-resolved
transverse resistance (ARTR) measurements, a very sensitive and background-free
technique that can detect 0.5$\%$ anisotropy in transport, we have observed it
also in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (LSCO) for $0.02 \leq x \leq 0.25$.
Arguably the key enigma in LSCO is the rotation of the nematic director with
temperature; this has not been seen before in any material. Here, we address
this puzzle by measuring the angle-resolved transverse magnetoresistance
(ARTMR) in LSCO. We report a discovery of colossal transverse magnetoresistance
(CTMR) -- an order-of-magnitude drop in the transverse resistivity in the
magnetic field of $6\,$T, while none is seen in the longitudinal resistivity.
We show that the apparent rotation of the nematic director is caused by
superconducting phase fluctuations, which are much more anisotropic than the
normal-electron fluid, and their respective directors are not parallel. This
qualitative conclusion is robust and follows straight from the raw experimental
data. We quantify this by modelling the measured (magneto-)conductivity by a
sum of two conducting channels that correspond to distinct anisotropic Drude
and Cooper-pair effective mass tensors. Strikingly, the anisotropy of
Cooper-pair stiffness is significantly larger than that of the normal
electrons, and it grows dramatically on the underdoped side, where the
fluctuations become effectively quasi-one dimensional.

disjoint paths starting at the apex and disjoint otherwise, each joining the
apex to a vertex of the base. For a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say a

that (even hole, triangle)-free graphs have treewidth at most five, which

  Here, we show that for every $t$, (even hole, pyramid, diamond, $K_t$)-free

contain diamonds, so our result is sharp in the sense that it is false if we do
not exclude diamonds. Our main result is in fact more general, that treewidth
is bounded in graphs excluding certain wheels and three-path-configurations,
diamonds, and a fixed complete graph. The proof uses ""non-crossing
decompositions"" methods similar to those in previous papers in this series. In
previous papers, however, bounded degree was a necessary condition to prove
bounded treewidth. The result of this paper is the first to use the method of
""non-crossing decompositions"" to prove bounded treewidth in a graph class of

improve the sentence ordering by introducing an aggregation method based on
majority voting of state-of-the-art methods and our proposed one. Our approach

The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
existing baselines on a corpus of short stories with a new state-of-the-art
performance in terms of Perfect Match Ratio (PMR) and Kendall's Tau (Tau)

replacing pronouns with their referring entities effectively encodes sentences

system size of the minimum gap that appears between the ground and first
excited state in the annealing energy spectrum. In general the algorithm is
unable to find the solution to an optimisation problem in polynomial time due
to the presence of avoided level crossings at which the gap size closes
exponentially with system size. One promising avenue being explored to produce
more favourable gap scaling is the introduction of non-stoquastic XX-couplings
in the form of a catalyst - of particular interest are catalysts which utilise
accessible information about the optimisation problem in their construction.
Here we show extreme sensitivity of the effect of an XX-catalyst to subtle
changes in the encoding of the optimisation problem. We observe that catalysts
designed to enhance the minimum gap at an avoided level crossing can, under
certain conditions, result in closing gaps in the spectrum. To understand the
origin of these closing gaps, we study how the evolution of the ground state
vector is altered by the presence of the catalyst. We find that the negative
components of the ground state vector are key to understanding the response of
the gap spectrum. In particular the closing gaps correspond to changes in which
vector components become negative over the course of the evolution. We also
consider how and when these closing gaps could be utilised in diabatic quantum
annealing protocols - a promising alternative to adiabatic quantum annealing in
which transitions to higher energy levels are exploited to reduce the run time

one or more variables which commutes with shifts. Group convolution generalizes
the concept to linear operations on functions of group elements representing
more general geometric transformations and which commute with those
transformations. Since similarity transformation is the most general geometric
transformation on images that preserves shape, the group convolution that is
equivariant to similarity transformation is the most general shape preserving
linear operator. Because similarity transformations have four free parameters,
group convolutions are defined on four-dimensional, joint orientation-scale
spaces. Although prior work on equivariant linear operators has been limited to
discrete groups, the similarity group is continuous. In this paper, we describe
linear operators on discrete representations that are equivariant to continuous
similarity transformation. This is achieved by using a basis of functions that
is it joint shiftable-twistable-scalable. These pinwheel functions use Fourier
series in the orientation dimension and Laplace transform in the log-scale
dimension to form a basis of spatially localized functions that can be
continuously interpolated in position, orientation and scale. Although this
result is potentially significant with respect to visual computation generally,
we present an initial demonstration of its utility by using it to compute a

invariant to rotation and scale change, the Fourier-Mellin transform has long
been used as a component in Euclidean invariant 2D shape recognition systems.
Yet Fourier-Mellin transform magnitudes are only invariant to rotation and
scale changes about a known center point, and full Euclidean invariant shape
recognition is not possible except when this center point can be consistently
and accurately identified. In this paper, we describe a system where a
Fourier-Mellin transform is computed at every point in the image. The spatial
support of the Fourier-Mellin basis functions is made local by multiplying them
with a polynomial envelope. Significantly, the magnitudes of convolutions with
these complex filters at isolated points are not (by themselves) used as
features for Euclidean invariant shape recognition because reliable
discrimination would require filters with spatial support large enough to fully
encompass the shapes. Instead, we rely on the fact that normalized histograms
of magnitudes are fully Euclidean invariant. We demonstrate a system based on
the VLAD machine learning method that performs Euclidean invariant recognition
of 2D shapes and requires an order of magnitude less training data than
comparable methods based on convolutional neural networks.

the effective cutting points in a differentially private way, resulting in a

  Environment",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Apart from the conventional parameters (such as signal-to-noise ratio, array
geometry and size, sample size), several other factors (e.g. alignment of the
antenna elements, polarization parameters) influence the performance of
direction of arrival (DOA) estimating algorithms. When all the antenna elements
are identically aligned, the polarization parameters do not affect the steering
vectors, which is the underlying assumption of all the conventional DOA
algorithms. Unfortunately, in this case, for a given set of DOA angles there
exists a range of polarization parameters which could result in a very low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across all the antenna elements in the array. To
avoid this type of catastrophic event, different antenna element needs to be
aligned differently. However, this fact will make almost all commonly used DOA
estimation algorithms non-operable, since the steering vectors are contaminated
by the polarization parameters. To the best of our knowledge, no work in the
literature addresses this issue even for a single user environment. In this
paper, that line of inquiry is pursued. We consider a circular array with the
minimum number of antenna elements and propose an antenna alignment scheme to
ensure that at any given point no more than one element will suffer from
significantly low SNR due to the contribution of polarization. A low complexity
algorithm that estimates the DOA angles in a closed-form manner is developed.
We treat MUSIC as the baseline algorithm and demonstrate how it can reliably
operate in all possible DOA and polarization environments. Finally, a thorough
performance and complexity analysis are illustrated for the above two
algorithms.

Pre-trained transformers are typically trained on an enormous amount of text

lattice that exhibits a new class of symmetry-protected topological phases with
very low Berry curvature but nontrivial bulk polarization, and fabricate an
optical topological insulator that provide the valley hall effect. Theoretical
analysis show that four type edge states can be obtained. Measurements of
THz-TDs with high time-resolution demonstrate that terahertz wave propagating
along the straight topological edge and Z-shape edge with sharp turns have
almost same high transmission in 0.440 THz to 0.457 THz domain range. Those
results quantitatively illustrate the suppression of backscattering due to the
non-trivial topology of the structure. The THz-TDs measurement yields amplitude

broadband infrared, single wavelength continuous-wave THz measurements and
visible spectroscopy. It allows further exploration of the effective refractive
index, group velocity and dispersion relations of edge states. Our work offers
possibilities for advanced control of the propagation and manipulation of THz

a number of local stochastic gradient steps and occasionally communicate with a
central node to improve their local optimization tasks. We analyze the effect
of local steps on the convergence rate and the communication complexity of
Local SGD. In particular, instead of assuming a fixed number of local steps
across all communication rounds, we allow the number of local steps during the
$i$-th communication round, $H_i$, to be different and arbitrary numbers. Our
main contribution is to characterize the convergence rate of Local SGD as a
function of $\{H_i\}_{i=1}^R$ under various settings of strongly convex,
convex, and nonconvex local functions, where $R$ is the total number of

conditions on the sequence $\{H_i\}_{i=1}^R$ such that Local SGD can achieve
linear speed-up with respect to the number of workers. Furthermore, we propose
a new communication strategy with increasing local steps superior to existing
communication strategies for strongly convex local functions. On the other

a target task can be improved via learning with additional auxiliary tasks
alongside this target task on a multi-task network. However, this method often
suffers from a serious optimization imbalance problem. On the one hand, one or
more auxiliary tasks might have a larger influence than the target task and
even dominate the network weights, resulting in worse recommendation accuracy
for the target task. On the other hand, the influence of one or more auxiliary
tasks might be too weak to assist the target task. More challenging is that
this imbalance dynamically changes throughout the training process and varies
across the parts of the same network. We propose a new method: MetaBalance to
balance auxiliary losses via directly manipulating their gradients w.r.t the
shared parameters in the multi-task network. Specifically, in each training
iteration and adaptively for each part of the network, the gradient of an
auxiliary loss is carefully reduced or enlarged to have a closer magnitude to
the gradient of the target loss, preventing auxiliary tasks from being so
strong that dominate the target task or too weak to help the target task.
Moreover, the proximity between the gradient magnitudes can be flexibly
adjusted to adapt MetaBalance to different scenarios. The experiments show that
our proposed method achieves a significant improvement of 8.34% in terms of
NDCG@10 upon the strongest baseline on two real-world datasets. The code of our

extensively investigated. The surface friction due to the complex flow
characteristics and momentum transport mechanism has also been studied in
depth. The micropillars are arranged in a quadrilateral, and different
arrangements are acquired by changing the streamwise and spanwise distances
between pillar rows. The results show that the streamwise and spanwise pillar
distances have their own different influences. When the streamwise pillar
distance is small, the micro eddies in the gaps between the streamwise
neighboring pillars are significantly suppressed. The increase in the spanwise
pillar distance enhances the momentum transport from the flow above pillar
array to the flow in the spaces among micro pillars. When the spanwise pillar
distance is small, the micro eddies in the gaps between the streamwise
neighboring pillars connect with each other and form a tubular eddy between
each pair of spanwise pillar rows. The tubular eddies significantly reduce the
momentum transport from the upper flow to the lower flow. The increase in the
streamwise pillar distance increase the momentum flux slightly. The surface
friction can be decomposed into three components which are associated with two
factors, the dilution effect of the number density of micro pillars and the
multi-faceted effects of micro eddies. These two factors are determined by the
streamwise and spanwise pillar distances. The dependence of the total friction
and its components on the pillar distances has been thoroughly examined.

carefully tune network architectures for the specific type of medical data. To

establish a triple-level framework to deduce registration network architectures

We conduct image registration experiments on multi-site volume datasets and

automatically learn an optimal deep registration network for given volumes and
achieve state-of-the-art performance, also significantly improving computation

synthesize visually pleasing domain transferred images with complex driving

semiconductors. They can spontaneously form and ``condense'' into a new
insulating ground state -- the so-called excitonic insulator -- when the energy
of electron-hole Coulomb attraction exceeds the band gap. In the presence of
electron-phonon coupling, a periodic lattice distortion often concomitantly
occurs with this exciton condensation. However, similar structural transition
can also be induced by electron-phonon coupling itself, therefore hindering the
clean identification of bulk excitonic insulators based on reductionistic
reasoning (e.g. which instability is the ``driving force'' of the phase
transition). Using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques, we identify key
electron-phonon coupling effects in a leading excitonic insulator candidate
Ta2NiSe5. These include an extensive unidirectional lattice fluctuation and an
electronic pseudogap in the normal state, as well as a negative electronic
compressibility in the charge-doped broken-symmetry state. In combination with
first principles and model calculations, we determine a minimal lattice model
and the corresponding interaction parameters that capture the experimental
observations. More importantly, we show how the Coulomb and electron-phonon
coupling effects can be separated on the level of lattice model, and
demonstrate a general framework beyond the reductionist approach in the

deepfake detection model behaves under such anomalies. However, due to the
black-box nature of deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, it is hard to predict the performance of a model when the input data
is modified. Crucially, if this defect is not addressed properly, it will
adversely affect the fairness of the model and result in discrimination of
certain sub-population unintentionally. Therefore, the objective of this work
is to adopt metamorphic testing to examine the reliability of the selected
deepfake detection model, and how the transformation of input variation places
influence on the output. We have chosen MesoInception-4, a state-of-the-art
deepfake detection model, as the target model and makeup as the anomalies.
Makeups are applied through utilizing the Dlib library to obtain the 68 facial
landmarks prior to filling in the RGB values. Metamorphic relations are derived
based on the notion that realistic perturbations of the input images, such as
makeup, involving eyeliners, eyeshadows, blushes, and lipsticks (which are
common cosmetic appearance) applied to male and female images, should not alter
the output of the model by a huge margin. Furthermore, we narrow down the scope
to focus on revealing potential gender biases in DL and AI systems.
Specifically, we are interested to examine whether MesoInception-4 model
produces unfair decisions, which should be considered as a consequence of
robustness issues. The findings from our work have the potential to pave the
way for new research directions in the quality assurance and fairness in DL and
AI systems.

enhancement of ~2770% over pristine polyetherimide (k ~ 0.23 Wm-1K-1). This
extraordinary enhancement in thermal conductivity is shown to be due to a
network of continuous graphene sheets over long length scales, resulting in low
thermal contact resistance at bends/turns due to the graphene sheets being
covalently bonded at such junctions. Solvent casting offers the advantage of
preserving the porous structure of expanded graphite in the composite,
resulting in the above highly thermally conductive interpenetrating network of
graphene and polymer. Solvent casting also does not break down the expanded
graphite particles, due to minimal forces involved, allowing for efficient heat
transfer over long length scales, further enhancing overall composite thermal
conductivity. Comparisons with a recently introduced effective medium model
shows a very high value of predicted particle-particle interfacial conductance,
providing evidence for efficient interfacial thermal transport in expanded

open up novel avenues for achieving high thermal conductivity polymer

endpoints in recent decades. Suppose the radiotherapy is evaluated in a phase
II trial using survival outcomes. In that case, the competing risk issue often
arises because the time to disease progression can be censored by the time to
normal tissue complications, and vice versa. Besides, much literature has
examined that patients receiving the same radiotherapy dose may yield distinct
responses due to their heterogeneous radiation susceptibility statuses.
Therefore, the ""one-dose-fit-all"" strategy often fails, and it is more relevant
to evaluate the subgroup-specific treatment effect with the subgroup defined by
the radiation susceptibility status. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
precision phase II trial design evaluating the subgroup-specific treatment
effects of radiotherapy. We use the cause-specific hazard approach to model the
competing risk survival outcomes. We propose restricting the candidate
radiation doses based on each patient's radiation susceptibility status. Only
the clinically feasible personalized dose will be considered, which enhances
the benefit for the patients in the trial. In addition, we propose a stratified
Bayesian adaptive randomization scheme such that more patients will be
randomized to the dose reporting more favorable survival outcomes. Numerical
studies have shown that the proposed design performed well and outperformed the
conventional design ignoring the competing risk issue.

improve the gate speed by 5--10 times compared to the RWA counterpart for
implementing high-fidelity ($\geq 99.99\%$) gates. Such an ultrafast evolution
(nanoseconds, even picoseconds) significantly reduces the influence of
decoherence (e.g., the qubit dissipation and dephasing). Moreover, because the
counter-rotating effects no longer induce gate infidelities (in both the weak

ultrafast geometric quantum gates with $\geq 99\%$ fidelities.

capture the latent correlations between IPs and between domains. We construct

estimated class-conditional distributions. However, the joint dependency among
the feature and the label is crucial for the adaptation task and is not fully

kernel Bures-Wasserstein distance between the joint distributions. Technically,
BJDA can effectively capture the nonlinear structures underlying the data. In
addition, we introduce a dynamic margin in contrastive learning phase to
flexibly characterize the class separability and improve the discriminative
ability of representations. It also avoids the cross-validation procedure to
determine the margin parameter in traditional triplet loss based methods.

deep vision models. However, current augmentations only mix samples at the

accumulated in the learning history. In this paper, we propose a recursive
mixed-sample learning paradigm, termed ""RecursiveMix"" (RM), by exploring a
novel training strategy that leverages the historical input-prediction-label
triplets. More specifically, we iteratively resize the input image batch from
the previous iteration and paste it into the current batch while their labels
are fused proportionally to the area of the operated patches. Further, a
consistency loss is introduced to align the identical image semantics across
the iterations, which helps the learning of scale-invariant feature
representations. Based on ResNet-50, RM largely improves classification
accuracy by $\sim$3.2\% on CIFAR100 and $\sim$2.8\% on ImageNet with negligible
extra computation/storage costs. In the downstream object detection task, the
RM pretrained model outperforms the baseline by 2.1 AP points and surpasses
CutMix by 1.4 AP points under the ATSS detector on COCO. In semantic
segmentation, RM also surpasses the baseline and CutMix by 1.9 and 1.1 mIoU

practical challenges arising in such settings: (i) Each task may have a
different subset of sensors, i.e., providing different partial observations of
the underlying 'system'. This restriction can be due to different manufacturers
in the former case, and people wearing more or less measurement devices in the
latter (ii) We are not allowed to store or re-access data from a task once it
has been observed at the task level. This may be due to privacy considerations
in the case of people, or legal restrictions placed by machine owners.
Nevertheless, we would like to (a) improve performance on subsequent tasks
using experience from completed tasks as well as (b) continue to perform better
on past tasks, e.g., update the model and improve predictions on even the first
machine after learning from subsequently observed ones. We note that existing
continual learning methods do not take into account variability in input
dimensions arising due to different subsets of sensors being available across
tasks, and struggle to adapt to such variable input dimensions (VID) tasks. In
this work, we address this shortcoming of existing methods. To this end, we
learn task-specific generative models and classifiers, and use these to augment
data for target tasks. Since the input dimensions across tasks vary, we propose
a novel conditioning module based on graph neural networks to aid a standard
recurrent neural network. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach on

based on structured implicit neural representations. ACID integrates two new
techniques: implicit representations for action-conditional dynamics and
geodesics-based contrastive learning. To represent deformable dynamics from
partial RGB-D observations, we learn implicit representations of occupancy and
flow-based forward dynamics. To accurately identify state change under large
non-rigid deformations, we learn a correspondence embedding field through a
novel geodesics-based contrastive loss. To evaluate our approach, we develop a
simulation framework for manipulating complex deformable shapes in realistic
scenes and a benchmark containing over 17,000 action trajectories with six
types of plush toys and 78 variants. Our model achieves the best performance in
geometry, correspondence, and dynamics predictions over existing approaches.
The ACID dynamics models are successfully employed to goal-conditioned

game theory that is widely used in various fields to allocate resources, assess
individual contributions, and determine fairness. The Shapley value formula and
his four axioms that characterize it form the foundation of the theory.
  Shapley value can be assigned only when all cooperative game players are
assumed to eventually form the grand coalition. The purpose of this paper is to
extend Shapley's theory to cover value allocation at every partial coalition
state.
  To achieve this, we first extend Shapley axioms into a new set of five axioms
that can characterize value allocation at every partial coalition state, where
the allocation at the grand coalition coincides with the Shapley value. Second,
we present a stochastic path integral formula, where each path now represents a
general coalition process. This can be viewed as an extension of the Shapley
formula. We apply these concepts to provide a dynamic interpretation and
extension of the value allocation schemes of Shapley, Nash, Kohlberg and
Neyman.
  This generalization is made possible by taking into account Hodge calculus,
stochastic processes, and path integration of edge flows on graphs. We
recognize that such generalization is not limited to the coalition game graph.
As a result, we define Hodge allocation, a general allocation scheme that can
be applied to any cooperative multigraph and yield allocation values at any
cooperative stage.

system is a topic of great interest. This topic has been studied extensively
and thus we found different approaches for the detection and classification of
multi-qubit entangled states. We have applied partial transposition operation
on one of the qubit of the three-qubit system and then studied the entanglement
properties of the three-qubit system, which is under investigation. Since the
partial transposition operation is not a quantum operation so we have
approximated partial transposition operation in such a way so that it represent
a completely positive map. The approximated partial transposition operation is
also known as structural physical approximation of partial transposition
(SPA-PT). We have studied in detail the application of SPA-PT on a three qubit
system and provided explicitly the matrix elements of the density matrix
describing SPA-PT of a three qubit system. Moreover, we propose criterion to
classify all possible stochastic local operations and classical
communication(SLOCC) inequivalent classes of a pure as well as mixed three
qubit state through SPA-PT map, which makes our criterion experimentally
realizable. We have illustrated our criterion for detection and classification
of three-qubit entangled states by considering few examples.

  functional theory",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DFT calculations have become widespread in both chemistry and materials,
because they usually provide useful accuracy at much lower computational cost
than wavefunction-based methods. All practical DFT calculations require an
approximation to the unknown exchange-correlation energy, which is then used
self-consistently in the Kohn-Sham scheme to produce an approximate energy from
an approximate density. Density-corrected DFT is simply the study of the
relative contributions to the total energy error. In the vast majority of DFT
calculations, the error due to the approximate density is negligible. But with
certain classes of functionals applied to certain classes of problems, the
density error is sufficiently large as to contribute to the energy noticeably,
and its removal leads to much better results. These problems include reaction
barriers, torsional barriers involving $\pi$-conjugation, halogen bonds,
radicals and anions, most stretched bonds, etc. In all such cases, use of a
more accurate density significantly improves performance, and often the simple
expedient of using the Hartree-Fock density is enough. This article explains
what DC-DFT is, where it is likely to improve results, and how DC-DFT can
produce more accurate functionals. We also outline challenges and prospects for
the field.

question in the affirmative for the prototypical problems of high-dimensional

increases when we have more structured sparsity: for block sparsity this gap
can be as large as polynomial in the dimensionality. Thus, the more structured

Firstly, previous works may acquire poor performance under domain shift

PLMs with millions of parameters. To alleviate it, we propose PromCSE

problem of intelligent vehicle under bounded disturbances. Based on a novel
event function using a clock-like variable to determine the triggering time, we
further introduce two new design parameters to improve control performance.
Distinct from existing event-based control mechanisms, the inter-event times
(IETs) derived from the above control framework are designable, meaning that
the proposed ETM can be deployed on practical vehicle more easily and
effectively. In addition, the improved IETs-designable ETM features a global
robust event-separation property that is extremely required for practical
lateral motion control of vehicle subject to diverse disturbances. Theoretical
analysis proves the feasibility and stability of the proposed control strategy
for trajectory tracking under bounded disturbances. Finally, simulation results
verify the theoretical results and show the advantages of the proposed control
strategy.

detection paradigm by eliminating a series of hand-crafted components. However,
DETR suffers from extremely slow convergence, which increases the training cost
significantly. We observe that the slow convergence is largely attributed to
the complication in matching object queries with target features in different
feature embedding spaces. This paper presents SAM-DETR, a
Semantic-Aligned-Matching DETR that greatly accelerates DETR's convergence
without sacrificing its accuracy. SAM-DETR addresses the convergence issue from
two perspectives. First, it projects object queries into the same embedding
space as encoded image features, where the matching can be accomplished
efficiently with aligned semantics. Second, it explicitly searches salient
points with the most discriminative features for semantic-aligned matching,
which further speeds up the convergence and boosts detection accuracy as well.
Being like a plug and play, SAM-DETR complements existing convergence solutions
well yet only introduces slight computational overhead. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed SAM-DETR achieves superior convergence as well as
competitive detection accuracy. The implementation codes are available at

metastable, triplet $5s5p\,^3P_1$ state, whose decay rate $\gamma_2$ is
$2\pi\times 7.5$ kHz, much smaller than the one in the singlet state or alkali
atoms. The influences of $\gamma_2$ on the transparency and absorption spectrum
in the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), and electromagnetically
induced absorption (EIA) regime are examined. Narrow transparent windows (EIT)
or absorption peaks (EIA) are found, whose distance in the spectrum depends on
the Rabi frequency of the weak MW field. It is found that the spectrum exhibits
higher contrast than using the singlet state or alkali atoms in typical
situations. Using the metastable intermediate state, we find that resonance
fluorescence of Sr gases exhibits very narrow peaks, which are modulated by the
MW field. When the MW field is weaker than the probe and control light, the
spectrum distance of these peaks are linearly proportional to $\Omega_m$. This
allows us to propose a new way to sense very weak MW fields through resonance
fluorescence. Our study shows that the Sr triplet state could be used to
develop the Rydberg MW electrometry that gains unique advantages.

gradient (CSG) method, including convergence results, step size rules and
algorithmic insights. We consider optimization problems in which the objective
function requires some form of integration, e.g., expected values. Since
approximating the integration by a fixed quadrature rule can introduce
artificial local solutions into the problem while simultaneously raising the
computational effort, stochastic optimization schemes have become increasingly
popular in such contexts. However, known stochastic gradient type methods are
typically limited to expected risk functions and inherently require many
iterations. The latter is particularly problematic, if the evaluation of the
cost function involves solving multiple state equations, given, e.g., in form
of partial differential equations. To overcome these drawbacks, a recent
article introduced the CSG method, which reuses old gradient sample information
via the calculation of design dependent integration weights to obtain a better
approximation to the full gradient. While in the original CSG paper convergence
of a subsequence was established for a diminishing step size, here, we provide
a complete convergence analysis of CSG for constant step sizes and an
Armijo-type line search. Moreover, new methods to obtain the integration
weights are presented, extending the application range of CSG to problems

in can be valuable for structure formation and evolution. This paper focus on
the baryonic-to-halo mass ratio (BHMR) and its evolution. We first review
unique properties of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow (SG-CFD),
followed by their application to derive BHMR. To maximize system entropy, the
long-range interaction requires a broad size of halos to be formed. These halos
facilitate inverse mass and energy cascade from small to large scales with a
constant rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_u$. In addition, dark matter flow
exhibits scale-dependent flow behaviors that is incompressible on small scale
and irrotational on large scale. With these properties and considering a given
halo with a total baryonic mass $m_b$, halo mass $m_h$, halo virial size $r_h$,
and flat rotation speed $v_f$, BHMR can be analytically derived by combining
the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and constant $\varepsilon_u$ in small and
large halos. A maximum BHMR ratio ~0.076 is found for halos with a critical
mass $m_{hc}\sim 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ at z=0. That ratio is much lower for both
smaller and larger halos such that two regimes can be identified: i) for
incompressible small halos with mass $m_h<m_{hc}$, we have
$\varepsilon_u\propto v_f/r_h$, $v_f\propto r_h$, and $m_b\propto m_h^{4/3}$;
ii) for large halos with mass $m_h>m_{hc}$, we have $\varepsilon_u\propto
v_f^3/r_h$, $v_f\propto r_h^{1/3}$, and $m_b\propto m_h^{4/9}$. Combined with
double-$\lambda$ halo mass function, the average BHMR ratio in all halos
(~0.024 at z=0) can be analytically derived, along with its redshift evolution.
The fraction of total baryons in all galaxies is ~7.6% at z=0 and increases
with time $\propto t^{1/3}$. The SPARC (Spitzer Photometry \& Accurate Rotation
Curves) data with 175 late-type galaxies were used for derivation and

orders of magnitude reduction of the communication overhead compared with
FedAvg and is flexible to handle heterogeneous models at the clients. However,
so far there is no unified algorithmic framework or theoretical analysis for
FD-based methods. In this paper, we first present a generic meta-algorithm for
FD and investigate the influence of key parameters through empirical
experiments. Then, we verify the empirical observations theoretically. Based on
the empirical results and theory, we propose a communication-efficient FD
algorithm with active data sampling to improve the model performance and reduce
the communication overhead. Empirical simulations on benchmark datasets will
demonstrate that our proposed algorithm effectively and significantly reduces
the communication overhead while achieving a satisfactory performance.

single image is insufficient as it reveals only one facet of a 3D object. To
provide sufficient information for estimating a complete texture map, the
proposed model simultaneously generates multi-view hallucinations in the image
domain and an estimated texture map in the texture domain. During the
generating process, each domain generator exchanges features to the other by a
flow-based local attention mechanism. In this manner, the proposed model can
estimate a texture map utilizing abundant multi-view image features from which
multiview hallucinations are generated. As a result, the estimated texture map
contains consistent colors and patterns over the entire region. Experiments
show the superiority of our model for estimating a directly render-able texture
map, which is applicable to 3D animation rendering. Furthermore, our model also
improves an overall generation quality in the image domain for pose and

gas effect in the micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) is investigated.
Considering the motion of structures (beam, cantilever, and membrane) in MEMS,
the dynamic response of structure will be influenced largely by the
squeeze-film damping. In the traditional model, a viscous damping assumption
that damping force is linear with moving velocity is used. As the nonlinear
damping phenomenon is observed for a micro-structure oscillating with a
high-velocity, this assumption is invalid and will generates error result for
predicting the response of micro-structure. In addition, due to the small size
of device and the low pressure of encapsulation, the gas in MEMS usually is
rarefied gas. Therefore, to correctly predict the damping force, the rarefied
gas effect must be considered. To study the nonlinear SFD phenomenon involving
the rarefied gas effect, a kinetic method, namely discrete unified gas kinetic
scheme (DUGKS), is introduced. And based on DUGKS, two solving methods, a
traditional decoupled method (Eulerian scheme) and a coupled framework
(arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme), are adopted. With these two methods,
two basic motion forms, linear (perpendicular) and tilting motions of a rigid
micro-beam, are studied with forced and free oscillations.

prohibitive adaptation costs. In fact, fine-tuning all the parameters of a
colossal model and retaining separate instances for different tasks are
practically infeasible. This necessitates a new branch of research focusing on
the parameter-efficient adaptation of PLMs, dubbed as delta tuning in this
paper. In contrast with the standard fine-tuning, delta tuning only fine-tunes
a small portion of the model parameters while keeping the rest untouched,
largely reducing both the computation and storage costs. Recent studies have
demonstrated that a series of delta tuning methods with distinct tuned
parameter selection could achieve performance on a par with full-parameter
fine-tuning, suggesting a new promising way of stimulating large-scale PLMs. In
this paper, we first formally describe the problem of delta tuning and then
comprehensively review recent delta tuning approaches. We also propose a
unified categorization criterion that divide existing delta tuning methods into
three groups: addition-based, specification-based, and reparameterization-based
methods. Though initially proposed as an efficient method to steer large
models, we believe that some of the fascinating evidence discovered along with
delta tuning could help further reveal the mechanisms of PLMs and even deep
neural networks. To this end, we discuss the theoretical principles underlying
the effectiveness of delta tuning and propose frameworks to interpret delta
tuning from the perspective of optimization and optimal control, respectively.
Furthermore, we provide a holistic empirical study of representative methods,
where results on over 100 NLP tasks demonstrate a comprehensive performance
comparison of different approaches. The experimental results also cover the
analysis of combinatorial, scaling and transferable properties of delta tuning.

improvements over various comparable baselines on some of the tasks, while

a novel Hierarchical Memory Learning (HML) framework to learn the model from

the model is first trained on the coarse predicates and then learns the fine

noticing that the HML framework can be taken as one general optimization

achieved on the SGG benchmark (i.e., Visual Genome).

Then, we implement six representative CSM algorithms, including IncIsoMatch,

IVM. We further conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the overall
performance of competing algorithms as well as study the effectiveness of
individual techniques to pinpoint the key factors leading to the performance

existing algorithms start the search from an edge in the query graph that maps
to an updated data edge, potentially leading to many invalid partial results;
(2) all matching orders are based on simple heuristics, which appear
ineffective at times; (3) index updates dominate the query time on some
queries; and (4) the algorithm with constant delay enumeration bears
significant index update cost. Consequently, no algorithm dominates the others
in all cases. Therefore, we give a few recommendations based on our experiment
results. In particular, the SymBi index is useful for sparse queries or long
running queries. The matching orders of IEDyn and TurboFlux work well on tree
queries, those of Graphflow on dense queries or when both query and data graphs
are sparse, and otherwise, we recommend SymBi's matching orders.

  MRI Synthesis Network","10 pages, 2 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Contrast-enhanced T1 (T1ce) is one of the most essential magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) modalities for diagnosing and analyzing brain tumors, especially
gliomas. In clinical practice, common MRI modalities such as T1, T2, and fluid
attenuation inversion recovery are relatively easy to access while T1ce is more
challenging considering the additional cost and potential risk of allergies to
the contrast agent. Therefore, it is of great clinical necessity to develop a
method to synthesize T1ce from other common modalities. Current paired image
translation methods typically have the issue of requiring a large amount of
paired data and do not focus on specific regions of interest, e.g., the tumor
region, in the synthesization process. To address these issues, we propose a
Difficulty-perceived common-to-T1ce Semi-Supervised multimodal MRI Synthesis
network (DS3-Net), involving both paired and unpaired data together with
dual-level knowledge distillation. DS3-Net predicts a difficulty map to
progressively promote the synthesis task. Specifically, a pixelwise constraint
and a patchwise contrastive constraint are guided by the predicted difficulty
map. Through extensive experiments on the publiclyavailable BraTS2020 dataset,
DS3-Net outperforms its supervised counterpart in each respect. Furthermore,
with only 5% paired data, the proposed DS3-Net achieves competitive performance
with state-of-theart image translation methods utilizing 100% paired data,
delivering an average SSIM of 0.8947 and an average PSNR of 23.60.

anisotropy (PMA), which enables memory cells with sufficient thermal stability

L10-FePt provide an efficient and scalable way to manipulate the L10-FePt
magnetization. However, the existence of external field during the switching
limits its practical application, and therefore field-free switching of the
L10-FePt is in highly demand. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the field-free
switching of the L10-FePt by growing it on vicinal MgO (001) substrates. This
method is different from previously established strategies, as it does not need
to add other functional layers or create asymmetry in the film structure. We
demonstrate the field-free switching is robust and can withstand strong field
disturbance up to ~1 kOe. The dependence on vicinal angle, film thickness, and
growth temperature demonstrated a wide operation window for the field-free
switching of the L10-FePt. We confirmed that the physical origin of the
field-free switching is the vicinal surface-induced the tilted anisotropy of
L10-FePt. We quantitatively characterize the spin-orbit torques in the L10-FePt
films, and found the spin-orbit torques are not significantly influenced by the
lattice strain from vicinal substrates. Our results extend beyond the
established strategies to realize field-free switching, and potentially could
be applied to other magnetic and antiferromagnetic systems.

entertainment, teaching, safe driving, and multimedia integration. Major
breakthroughs have been made recently in the areas of affective computing
(i.e., emotion recognition and sentiment analysis). Affective computing is
realized based on unimodal or multimodal data, primarily consisting of physical
information (e.g., textual, audio, and visual data) and physiological signals
(e.g., EEG and ECG signals). Physical-based affect recognition caters to more
researchers due to multiple public databases. However, it is hard to reveal
one's inner emotion hidden purposely from facial expressions, audio tones, body
gestures, etc. Physiological signals can generate more precise and reliable
emotional results; yet, the difficulty in acquiring physiological signals also
hinders their practical application. Thus, the fusion of physical information
and physiological signals can provide useful features of emotional states and
lead to higher accuracy. Instead of focusing on one specific field of affective
analysis, we systematically review recent advances in the affective computing,
and taxonomize unimodal affect recognition as well as multimodal affective
analysis. Firstly, we introduce two typical emotion models followed by commonly
used databases for affective computing. Next, we survey and taxonomize
state-of-the-art unimodal affect recognition and multimodal affective analysis

some important aspects on affective computing and their applications and
conclude this review with an indication of the most promising future

set of target words is already given. This implies that these models do not
learn to recognise speech from scratch without prior knowledge and explicit
supervision. Visually grounded speech models learn to recognise speech without
prior knowledge by exploiting statistical dependencies between spoken and
visual input. While it has previously been shown that visually grounded speech
models learn to recognise the presence of words in the input, we explicitly
investigate such a model as a model of human speech recognition.
  Methods: We investigate the time-course of word recognition as simulated by
the model using a gating paradigm to test whether its recognition is affected
by well-known word-competition effects in human speech processing. We
furthermore investigate whether vector quantisation, a technique for discrete
representation learning, aids the model in the discovery and recognition of
words.
  Results/Conclusion: Our experiments show that the model is able to recognise
nouns in isolation and even learns to properly differentiate between plural and
singular nouns. We also find that recognition is influenced by word competition
from the word-initial cohort and neighbourhood density, mirroring word
competition effects in human speech comprehension. Lastly, we find no evidence
that vector quantisation is helpful in discovering and recognising words. Our
gating experiments even show that the vector quantised model requires more of
the input sequence for correct recognition.

applicable to generic sparse symmetric systems without any additional

  In this work, we present the architecture and proof of concept results for a

developed an efficient propagator in modern C++ accounting for Earth's

close encounters to allow a detailed study of both. We analyze the runtime and

demonstrates a few orders rapid reduction of the domain wall resistance
accompanied by its possible deviations versus the diameter growth ranging from
1.2 nm to 15.2 nm. The origin of these deviations, which are also identified as
oscillations, is referred to the non-uniform electron scattering on the domain
wall due to the intermixing electron scattering conditions: ballistic for one
spin channel and quasi-ballistic for other one with opposite spin direction. It
may happen when the domain wall width by value is approximately in between two
lengths: a mean free path with the spin down and spin up. The indirect evidence
of this finding is also coming from the fact that homogeneous nanowires shows
the most valuable domain wall resistance oscillations by magnitude rather than
segmented magnetic nanowires. In addition to the approach, where DW width is
constant, the other reasonable model is used when the domain wall can be
constrained for some conditions. The same results are valid for magnetic
junctions with domain wall. Finally, resistance simulation in the diffusive

Natural questions are then: does there exist an optimal strategy, that is, a

solve the data collection problem. However, self-supervised denoising methods,

mapper that enables global perception and accelerates training. The mask mapper
samples all pixels at blind spots on denoised volumes and maps them to the same
channel, allowing the loss function to optimize all blind spots at once.
Second, we propose a re-visible loss to train the denoising network and make
blind spots visible. The denoiser can learn directly from raw noise images
without losing information or being trapped in identity mapping. We also
theoretically analyze the convergence of the re-visible loss. Extensive

intricate than that of the well-studied switched linear systems, essentially
due to the existence of distinct equilibrium points for each subsystem. First,
under arbitrary switching rules, the stability analysis must be generally
carried out with respect to a compact set with non-empty interior rather than
to a singleton. We provide a novel proof technique for existence and outer
approximation of attractive invariant sets of a switched affine system, under
the hypothesis of global uniform stability of its linearization. On the other
hand, considering dwell-time switching signals, forward invariant sets need not
exist for this class of switched systems, even for stable ones. Hence, more
general notions of stability/boundedness are introduced and studied,
highlighting the relations of these concepts to the uniform stability of the
linear part of the system under the same class of dwell-time switching signals.
These results reveal the main differences and specificities of switched affine
systems with respect to linear ones, providing a first step for the analysis of
switched systems composed by subsystems not sharing the same equilibrium.
Numerical methods based on linear matrix inequalities and sum-of-squares

State and Input Sensitivity-based with Observability-aware trajectory planning?
These possibly opposite optimization objectives can be used to improve
trajectory control tracking and, at the same time, estimation performance. Our
proposed novel Control & Observability-aware Planning (COP) framework is the
first that uses these possibly opposing objectives in a Single-Objective
Optimization Problem (SOOP) based on the Augmented Weighted Tchebycheff method
to perform the balancing of them and generation of B\'ezier curve-based
trajectories. Statistically relevant simulations for a 3D quadrotor unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) case study produce results that support our claims and
show the negative correlation between both objectives. We were able to reduce
the positional mean integral error norm as well as the estimation uncertainty
with the same trajectory to comparable levels of the trajectories optimized
with individual objectives.

evolution of quantum systems and their existence has been theoretically
predicted and experimentally observed. However, how the system behaves in the
vicinity of DQPT and its connection to physical observables remains an open
question. In this work, we introduce the concept of the Loschmidt amplitude
spectrum (LAS), which extends the Loscmidt amplitude - the detector of the
transition - by considering the overlap of the initial state to all the
eigenstates of the prequench Hamiltonian. By analysing the LAS in the
integrable transverse-field Ising model, we find that the system undergoes a
population redistribution in the momentum space across DQPT. In the
quasiparticle picture, all the lower-half k modes are excited when the system
is at DQPT. The LAS is also applicable to study the dynamics of non-integrable
models where we have investigated the Ising model with next-nearest-neighbour
interactions as an example. The time evolution of the system's magnetization is
found to be connected to the products of the LAS and there exists a
simultaneous overlap of the time-evolved state to pairs of eigenstates of the
prequnech Hamiltonian that possess spin configurations of negative
magnetization. Our findings provide a better understanding of the
characteristics of the out-of-equilibrium system around DQPT.

which makes global and continuous emission monitoring impossible. A promising
approach is the application of remote sensing. Studies showed that some of the
$\text{NO}_\text{2}$ plumes from individual ships can visually be distinguished
using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Copernicus Sentinel 5

AT2020hur. Although the giant flare afterglow model can interpret the
observations of AT2020hur, the derived kinetic energy of such a GF is at least
three orders of magnitude larger than that of the typical GF, and there is a
lot of fine tuning and coincidences required for this model. Another possible
explanation is that AT2020hur might consist of two or more optical flares
originating from the FRB source, e.g. fast optical bursts produced by the
inverse Compton scattering of FRB emission. Besides, AT2020hur is located in
one of the activity windows of FRB 180916B, which is an independent support for
the association. This coincidence may be due to the reason that the optical
counterpart is subject to the same periodic modulation as FRB 180916B, as
implied by the prompt FRB counterparts. Future simultaneous observations of
FRBs and their optical counterparts may help reveal their physical origin.

is twofold. First, we investigate to what extent individual factors associate
with the mobility of researchers. Second, we explore the relationship between
mobility and scientific activity and impact. For this purpose, we used a
bibliometric approach to track the mobility of authors. To compare the
scientific outcomes of researchers, we considered the number of publications

co-authors in all their publications. We also analysed the co-authorship
network of researchers and compared centrality measures of mobile and
non-mobile researchers. Results show that researchers from North America and
Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly female ones, have the lowest, respectively,
highest tendency towards international mobility. Having international
co-authors increases the probability of international movement. Our findings
uncover gender inequality in international mobility across scientific fields
and countries. Across genders, researchers in the Physical sciences have the
most and in the Social sciences the least rate of mobility. We observed more
mobility for Social scientists at the advanced career stage, while researchers
in other fields prefer to move at earlier career stages. Also, we found a
positive correlation between mobility and scientific outcomes, but no apparent
difference between females and males. Comparing the centrality of mobile and
non-mobile researchers in the co-authorship networks reveals a higher social
capital advantage for mobile researchers.

test the validity of this approach using in-situ plasma data from 151 magnetic
clouds (MCs) observed by the WIND spacecraft and 45 observed by the Helios
spacecrafts. We find that the most probable cross-section expansion speeds for
the WIND events are only $\approx 0.06$ times the Alfv\'en speed inside the MCs
while the most probable cross-section expansion speeds for the Helios events is
$\approx 0.03$. MC cross-sections can thus be considered to be nearly static
over an Alfv\'en crossing timescale. Using estimates of electrical conductivity
arising from Coulomb collisions, we find that the Lundquist number inside MCs
is high ($\approx 10^{13}$), suggesting that the MHD description is well
justified. The Joule heating rates using our conductivity estimates are several
orders of magnitude lower than the requirement for plasma heating inside MCs
near the Earth. While the (low) heating rates we compute are consistent with
the MHD description, the discrepancy with the heating requirement points to
possible departures from MHD and the need for a better understanding of plasma
heating in MCs.

distinct phases: The first phase is free fall dominated, due to the
self-gravity of the filament. In the second phase, after the turning point, the
collapse is balanced by the ram pressure, produced by the inside material of
the filament, which leads to a constant collapse velocity. This approach
reproduces the established collapse time of uniform density filaments and
agrees well with our hydrodynamic simulations. In addition, we investigate the
influence of different radial density profiles on the collapse. We find that
the deviations compared to the uniform filament are less than 10%. Therefore,
the analytic collapse model of the uniform density filament is an excellent
general approach.

Specifically, we resort to context augmentation and spatial attention
mechanisms to make our MTLDesc obtain non-local awareness. First, Adaptive
Global Context Augmented Module and Diverse Local Context Augmented Module are
proposed to construct robust local descriptors with context information from
global to local. Second, Consistent Attention Weighted Triplet Loss is designed
to integrate spatial attention awareness into both optimization and matching
stages of local descriptors learning. Third, Local Features Detection with

success in the field of self-supervised representation learning and the learned
representations are useful in broad downstream tasks. Since all supervision
information for one view comes from the other view, contrastive learning
approximately obtains the minimal sufficient representation which contains the
shared information and eliminates the non-shared information between views.
Considering the diversity of the downstream tasks, it cannot be guaranteed that
all task-relevant information is shared between views. Therefore, we assume the
non-shared task-relevant information cannot be ignored and theoretically prove
that the minimal sufficient representation in contrastive learning is not
sufficient for the downstream tasks, which causes performance degradation. This
reveals a new problem that the contrastive learning models have the risk of
over-fitting to the shared information between views. To alleviate this
problem, we propose to increase the mutual information between the
representation and input as regularization to approximately introduce more
task-relevant information, since we cannot utilize any downstream task
information during training. Extensive experiments verify the rationality of
our analysis and the effectiveness of our method. It significantly improves the
performance of several classic contrastive learning models in downstream tasks.

effect to regulate the parabolic velocity distribution of fluid in the

particles in inertial microfluidics. The flow field of a microchannel with a
unilateral slip boundary is equivalent to that of the microchannel widened by
the relevant slip length, and the particle equilibrium positions in the two
microchannels are consistent consequently. Then, we simulate the lateral
migrations of three kinds of typical particles, namely circle, ellipse, and
rectangle in the microchannel. Unlike the smooth trajectories of circular
particles, the motions of the elliptical and rectangular particles are
accompanied by regular fluctuations and non-uniform rotations due to their
non-circular geometries. The results demonstrate that the unilateral slip
boundary can effectively control the vertical equilibrium position of
particles. Thus, the present scheme enables to active manipulate the particles
positions in vertical direction and can promote more accurate focusing,
separating, and transport in inertial microfluidics.

mirrors were set at room temperature. The duty factor of the operation was
approximately 53%, and the strain sensitivity was
$3\times10^{-22}~/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ at 250 Hz. In addition, the
binary-neutron-star (BNS) inspiral range was approximately 0.6 Mpc. The
contributions of various noise sources to the sensitivity of O3GK were
investigated to understand how the observation range could be improved; this
study is called a ""noise budget"". According to our noise budget, the measured
sensitivity could be approximated by adding up the effect of each noise. The
sensitivity was dominated by noise from the sensors used for local controls of

frequency noise. Further, other noise sources that did not limit the

  with the James Webb Space Telescope","33 pages, 24 figures. Submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A currently unsolved question in supernova research is the origin of
stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). Such SNe lack spectral signatures of
hydrogen (Type Ib), or hydrogen and helium (Type Ic), indicating that the outer
stellar layers have been stripped during their evolution. The mechanism for
this is not well understood, and to disentangle the different scenarios
determination of nucleosynthesis yields from observed spectra can be attempted.
However, the interpretation of observations depends on the adopted spectral
models. A previously missing ingredient in these is the inclusion of molecular
effects, which can be significant. We aim to investigate how the molecular
chemistry in stripped-envelope supernovae affects physical conditions and
optical spectra and produces ro-vibrational emission in the mid-infrared (MIR).
We also aim to assess the diagnostic potential of observations of such MIR
emission with JWST. We couple a chemical kinetic network including carbon,
oxygen, silicon, and sulfur-bearing molecules into the NLTE spectral synthesis
code SUMO. We let four species - CO, SiO, SiS and SO - participate in the NLTE
cooling of the gas to achieve self-consistency between the molecule formation
and the temperature. We apply the new framework to model the spectrum of a Type
Ic supernova in the 100-600d time range. Molecules are predicted to form in
SESN ejecta in significant quantities (typical mass $10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$)
throughout the 100-600d interval. The impact on the temperature and optical
emission depends on the density of the oxygen zones and varies with epoch. For
example, the [O I] 6300, 6364 feature can be quenched by molecules from 200 to
450d depending on density. The MIR predictions show strong emission in the
fundamental bands of CO, SiO, and SiS, and in the CO and SiO overtones.

provide an additional regularization parameter used in applications to optimize
performance outside the training set by balancing between making fewer training

noise, we can predict the probability of classification errors and their
dependence on regularization, demonstrating a finite optimal choice. The theory
describes a previously unknown phase transition, corresponding to the
disappearance of a non-trivial solution, thus providing a soft version of the

mechanical shear energy in non-equilibrium thermodynamic states. This effect
called thermoelasticity is well known in solid materials. The observation of a
thermal coupling to the mechanical shear deformation reinforces the assumption
of elastically correlated liquid molecules. The amplitude of the thermoelastic
waves increases linearly by increasing the shear strain amplitude up to a
transition to a non-linear thermal behavior, similar in strain behavior to an
elastic to plastic regime. The thermo-elastic effects are not detectable via

investigated though heavily desired. In this work, we empirically find that
with the same few-shot learning frameworks, \eg~Meta-Baseline, replacing the
widely used CNN feature extractor with a ViT model often severely impairs
few-shot classification performance. Moreover, our empirical study shows that
in the absence of inductive bias, ViTs often learn the low-qualified token
dependencies under few-shot learning regime where only a few labeled training
data are available, which largely contributes to the above performance
degradation. To alleviate this issue, for the first time, we propose a simple
yet effective few-shot training framework for ViTs, namely Self-promoted
sUpervisioN (SUN). Specifically, besides the conventional global supervision
for global semantic learning SUN further pretrains the ViT on the few-shot
learning dataset and then uses it to generate individual location-specific
supervision for guiding each patch token. This location-specific supervision
tells the ViT which patch tokens are similar or dissimilar and thus accelerates
token dependency learning. Moreover, it models the local semantics in each
patch token to improve the object grounding and recognition capability which
helps learn generalizable patterns. To improve the quality of location-specific
supervision, we further propose two techniques:~1) background patch filtration
to filtrate background patches out and assign them into an extra background
class; and 2) spatial-consistent augmentation to introduce sufficient diversity
for data augmentation while keeping the accuracy of the generated local
supervisions. Experimental results show that SUN using ViTs significantly
surpasses other few-shot learning frameworks with ViTs and is the first one
that achieves higher performance than those CNN state-of-the-arts.

justify both the classicality as well as the quantumness of the primordial
perturbations at the end of inflation. We reexamine this question and point out
that the definition of two-mode squeezing of the modes $\vec k$ and $-\vec k$
used in previous work rests on choices that are only justified for systems with
time-independent Hamiltonians and finitely many degrees of freedom. We argue
that for quantum fields propagating on generic time-dependent
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker backgrounds, the notion of squeezed
states is subject to ambiguities, which go hand in hand with the ambiguity in
the definition of particles. In other words, we argue that the question ""does
the cosmic expansion squeeze and entangle modes with wavenumbers $\vec k$ and
$-\vec k$?"" contains the same ambiguity as the question ""does the cosmic
expansion create particles?"". When additional symmetries are present, like in
the (quasi) de Sitter-like spacetimes used in inflationary models, one can
resolve the ambiguities, and we find that the answer to the question in the
title turns out to be in the negative. We further argue that this fact does not
make the state of cosmological perturbations any less quantum, at least when
deviations from Gaussianity can be neglected.

introduce an Example-Based GEC (EB-GEC) that presents examples to language
learners as a basis for a correction result. The examples consist of pairs of

of points in $\mathbb{R}^D$ such that the subset of points inside a
semialgebraic region described by $O(1)$ polynomial inequalities of degree
$\Delta$ can be found efficiently.
  Relatively recently, several major advances were made on this problem. Using
algebraic techniques, ""near-linear space"" structures [AMS13,MP15] with almost
optimal query time of $Q(n)=O(n^{1-1/D+o(1)})$ were obtained. For ""fast query""
structures (i.e., when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}$), it was conjectured that a structure
with space $S(n) = O(n^{D+o(1)})$ is possible. The conjecture was refuted
recently by Afshani and Cheng [AC21]. In the plane, they proved that $S(n) =
\Omega(n^{\Delta+1 - o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\Delta+3)\Delta/2})$ which shows
$\Omega(n^{\Delta+1-o(1)})$ space is needed for $Q(n) = n^{o(1)}$. While this
refutes the conjecture, it still leaves a number of unresolved issues: the
lower bound only works in 2D and for fast queries, and neither the exponent of
$n$ or $Q(n)$ seem to be tight even for $D=2$, as the current upper bound is
$S(n) = O(n^{\boldsymbol{m}+o(1)}/Q(n)^{(\boldsymbol{m}-1)D/(D-1)})$ where
$\boldsymbol{m}=\binom{D+\Delta}{D}-1 = \Omega(\Delta^D)$ is the maximum number
of parameters to define a monic degree-$\Delta$ $D$-variate polynomial, for any
$D,\Delta=O(1)$.
  In this paper, we resolve two of the issues: we prove a lower bound in
$D$-dimensions and show that when $Q(n)=n^{o(1)}+O(k)$,
$S(n)=\Omega(n^{\boldsymbol{m}-o(1)})$, which is almost tight as far as the
exponent of $n$ is considered in the pointer machine model. When considering
the exponent of $Q(n)$, we show that the analysis in [AC21] is tight for $D=2$,
by presenting matching upper bounds for uniform random point sets. This shows
either the existing upper bounds can be improved or a new fundamentally
different input set is needed to get a better lower bound.

been made in recent years. However, most works rely on a key assumption that
each video is successfully preprocessed by detection and tracking algorithms

real-world environments, we often encounter miss-detection of target agents
(e.g., pedestrian, vehicles) caused by the bad image conditions, such as the
occlusion by other agents. In this paper, we address the problem of trajectory
prediction from incomplete observed trajectory due to miss-detection, where the
observed trajectory includes several missing data points. We introduce a
two-block RNN model that approximates the inference steps of the Bayesian
filtering framework and seeks the optimal estimation of the hidden state when
miss-detection occurs. The model uses two RNNs depending on the detection
result. One RNN approximates the inference step of the Bayesian filter with the
new measurement when the detection succeeds, while the other does the
approximation when the detection fails. Our experiments show that the proposed
model improves the prediction accuracy compared to the three baseline

energy, typically physical movement. They are absolutely essential for any
system that needs to impact or modify the physical world, and are used in
millions of systems of all sizes, all over the world, from cars and spacecraft
to factory control systems and critical infrastructure. An actuator is a ""dumb
device"" that is entirely controlled by the surrounding electronics, e.g., a
microcontroller, and thus cannot authenticate its control signals or do any
other form of processing. The problem we look at in this paper is how the wires
that connect an actuator to its control electronics can act like antennas,
picking up electromagnetic signals from the environment. This makes it possible
for a remote attacker to wirelessly inject signals (energy) into these wires to
bypass the controller and directly control the actuator.
  To detect such attacks, we propose a novel detection method that allows the
microcontroller to monitor the control signal and detect attacks as a deviation
from the intended value. We have managed to do this without requiring the
microcontroller to sample the signal at a high rate or run any signal
processing. That makes our defense mechanism practical and easy to integrate
into existing systems. Our method is general and applies to any type of
actuator (provided a few basic assumptions are met), and can deal with
adversaries with arbitrarily high transmission power. We implement our
detection method on two different practical systems to show its generality,
effectiveness, and robustness.

effect of photometric noise, we find 35.6\pm2.1% of the epoch-pairs show
asynchronous variability between X-ray and UV (brightening in one band but
dimming in the other). This indicates only in 28.8\pm4.2% of the epoch-pairs
the X-ray and UV variability are intrinsically coordinated. The variability
synchronicity exhibits no dependence on physical parameters of quasars or the
time lag of the epoch-pairs, except for stronger variability tends to have
stronger synchronicity. Switches between synchronous and asynchronous
variability are also seen in individual sources. The poor coordination clearly
contradicts both the X-ray reprocessing model and the accretion rate variation
model for AGN variability. The ratios of the observed X-ray variability
amplitude to that in UV span a broad range and peak at ~ 2. The dominant
fraction of the ratios appear too small to be attributed to X-ray reprocessing,

of complex uncertain systems with numerous unknown parameters. Accurate

additional data may be high. In such cases, based on a Bayesian paradigm, we
can design robust operators retaining the best overall performance across all
possible models and design optimal experiments that can effectively reduce
uncertainty to enhance the performance of such operators maximally. While
objective-based uncertainty quantification (objective-UQ) based on MOCU (mean
objective cost of uncertainty) provides an effective means for quantifying
uncertainty in complex systems, the high computational cost of estimating MOCU

neural message-passing model for surrogate modeling, incorporating a novel
axiomatic constraint loss that penalizes an increase in the estimated system
uncertainty. As an illustrative example, we consider the optimal experimental
design (OED) problem for uncertain Kuramoto models, where the goal is to
predict the experiments that can most effectively enhance robust
synchronization performance through uncertainty reduction. We show that our

foster discoveries of novel clinical phenotypes and to better characterize long
term effect of medical treatments. However, due to limitations inherent in the
collection process, RWE often lacks key features of patients, particularly when
these features cannot be directly encoded using data standards such as ICD-10.
Here we propose a novel data-driven statistical machine learning approach,
named Feature Imputation via Local Likelihood (FILL), designed to infer missing
features by exploiting feature similarity between patients. We test our method
using a particularly challenging problem: differentiating heart failure
patients with reduced versus preserved ejection fraction (HFrEF and HFpEF
respectively). The complexity of the task stems from three aspects: the two
share many common characteristics and treatments, only part of the relevant
diagnoses may have been recorded, and the information on ejection fraction is
often missing from RWE datasets. Despite these difficulties, our method is
shown to be capable of inferring heart failure patients with HFpEF with a
precision above 80% when considering multiple scenarios across two RWE datasets
containing 11,950 and 10,051 heart failure patients. This is an improvement
when compared to classical approaches such as logistic regression and random
forest which were only able to achieve a precision < 73%. Finally, this
approach allows us to analyse which features are commonly associated with HFpEF
patients. For example, we found that specific diagnostic codes for atrial
fibrillation and personal history of long-term use of anticoagulants are often
key in identifying HFpEF patients.

emission from the northern hot spot; a region with enhanced star-formation off
the nucleus of M51. Based on the high spectral resolution data from
XMM-Newton/RGS observations, we unambiguously detect a high $G$ ratio
($3.2^{+6.9}_{-1.5}$) of the OVII He$\alpha$ triplet. This high $G$ ratio is
also spatially confirmed by oxygen emission-line maps from the same data. A
physical model consisting of a thermal plasma and its charge exchange (CX) with
neutral cool gas gives a good explanation for the $G$ ratio and the entire RGS
spectra. This model also gives a satisfactory characterization of the
complementary Chandra/ACIS-S data, which enables a direct imaging of the
diffuse emission, tracing the hot plasma across the galaxy. The hot plasma has
a similar characteristic temperature of ~0.34 keV and an approximately solar
metallicity. The CX contributes ~50% to the diffuse emission in the 0.4-1.8 keV
band, suggesting an effective hot/cool gas interface area about five times the
geometric area of the M51 disk. Therefore, the CX appears to play a major role
in the soft X-ray production and may be used as a powerful tool to probe the
interface astrophysics, important for studying galactic ecosystems.

the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method and offer a view complementary to that of the
two-point correlation functions in real space, as the two estimators are known
to compress and select Gaussian information in different ways, due to scale
cuts. They may also be differently affected by systematic effects and
theoretical uncertainties, such as baryons and intrinsic alignments (IA),
making this analysis an important cross-check. In the context of $\Lambda$CDM,
and using the same fiducial model as in the DES Y3 real space analysis, we find
${S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.793^{+0.038}_{-0.025}}$,
which further improves to ${S_8 = 0.784\pm 0.026 }$ when including shear
ratios. This constraint is within expected statistical fluctuations from the
real space analysis, and in agreement with DES~Y3 analyses of non-Gaussian
statistics, but favors a slightly higher value of $S_8$, which reduces the
tension with the Planck cosmic microwave background 2018 results from
$2.3\sigma$ in the real space analysis to $1.5\sigma$ in this work. We explore
less conservative IA models than the one adopted in our fiducial analysis,
finding no clear preference for a more complex model. We also include small
scales, using an increased Fourier mode cut-off up to $k_{\rm max}={5}{h{\rm
Mpc}^{-1}}$, which allows to constrain baryonic feedback while leaving
cosmological constraints essentially unchanged. Finally, we present an

out-of-plane bending elasticity. Their open edges and micron length scale
provide a tractable system to study the equilibrium energetics and dynamic
pathways of membrane assembly and reconfiguration. Here, we find that doping
colloidal membranes with short miscible rods transforms disk-shaped membranes
into saddle-shaped surfaces with complex edge structures. The saddle-shaped
membranes are well-approximated by Enneper's minimal surfaces. Theoretical
modeling demonstrates that their formation is driven by increasing positive
Gaussian modulus, which in turn is controlled by the fraction of short rods.
Further coalescence of saddle-shaped surfaces leads to diverse topologically
distinct structures, including catenoids, tri-noids, four-noids, and higher
order structures. At long time scales, we observe the formation of a
system-spanning, sponge-like phase. The unique features of colloidal membranes
reveal the topological transformations that accompany coalescence pathways in
real time. We enhance the functionality of these membranes by making their
shape responsive to external stimuli. Our results demonstrate a novel pathway
towards control of thin elastic sheets' shape and topology -- a pathway driven
by the emergent elasticity induced by compositional heterogeneity.

formation. Because blastwaves from individual SNe occur on scales that remain
unresolved in modern cosmological simulations, SN feedback must be implemented
as a subgrid model. Differences in the manner in which SN energy is coupled to
the local interstellar medium and in which excessive radiative losses are
prevented have resulted in a zoo of models used by different groups. However,
the importance of the selection of resolution elements around young stellar
particles for SN feedback has largely been overlooked. In this work, we examine
various selection methods using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code SWIFT.
We run a suite of isolated disk galaxy simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy
and small cosmological volumes, all with the thermal stochastic SN feedback
model used in the EAGLE simulations. We complement the original mass-weighted
neighbour selection with a novel algorithm guaranteeing that the SN energy
distribution is as close to isotropic as possible. Additionally, we consider
algorithms where the energy is injected into the closest, least dense, or most
dense neighbour. We show that different neighbour-selection strategies cause
significant variations in star formation rates, gas densities, wind mass
loading factors, and galaxy morphology. The isotropic method results in more
efficient feedback than the conventional mass-weighted selection. We conclude
that the manner in which the feedback energy is distributed among the
resolution elements surrounding a feedback event is as important as changing
the amount of energy by factors of a few.

translation providers and their customers. While translation scholars are aware
of the importance of having a reliable way to conduct the TQA process, it seems
that there is limited literature that tackles the issue of reliability with a
quantitative approach. In this work, we consider the TQA as a complex process
from the point of view of physics of complex systems and approach the
reliability issue from the Bayesian paradigm. Using a dataset of translation
quality evaluations (in the form of error annotations), produced entirely by
the Professional Translation Service Provider Translated SRL, we compare two
Bayesian models that parameterise the following features involved in the TQA
process: the translation difficulty, the characteristics of the translators
involved in producing the translation, and of those assessing its quality - the
reviewers. We validate the models in an unsupervised setting and show that it
is possible to get meaningful insights into translators even with just one
review per translation; subsequently, we extract information like translators'
skills and reviewers' strictness, as well as their consistency in their
respective roles. Using this, we show that the reliability of reviewers cannot
be taken for granted even in the case of expert translators: a translator's
expertise can induce a cognitive bias when reviewing a translation produced by
another translator. The most expert translators, however, are characterised by
the highest level of consistency, both in translating and in assessing the
translation quality.

applications has given rise to edge federations that seamlessly interconnect
and leverage resources from multiple edge service providers. The requirement of
supporting both latency-sensitive and compute-intensive IoT tasks necessitates
service resilience, especially for the broker nodes in typical broker-worker
deployment designs. Existing fault-tolerance or resilience schemes often lack
robustness and generalization capability in non-stationary workload settings.
This is typically due to the expensive periodic fine-tuning of models required
to adapt them in dynamic scenarios. To address this, we present a confidence
aware resilience model, CAROL, that utilizes a memory-efficient generative
neural network to predict the Quality of Service (QoS) for a future state and a
confidence score for each prediction. Thus, whenever a broker fails, we quickly
recover the system by executing a local-search over the broker-worker topology
space and optimize future QoS. The confidence score enables us to keep track of
the prediction performance and run parsimonious neural network fine-tuning to
avoid excessive overheads, further improving the QoS of the system. Experiments
on a Raspberry-Pi based edge testbed with IoT benchmark applications show that
CAROL outperforms state-of-the-art resilience schemes by reducing the energy
consumption, deadline violation rates and resilience overheads by up to 16, 17

that, differently from any other existing SA method, it offers an interpretable

the target and the source speakers, reflecting their similarity in terms of

$|\lambda|<60^{\rm{o}}$ for $i_*>90^{\rm{o}}$ on average, and they tend to
shrink as the impact parameter increases. Additionally, in contrast to the
crucial impact of brightness, we identify that exposure time has a negligible
impact on the difficulty of detecting DR as the increase in signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N) at longer exposure times is counteracted by the degraded sampling
rate. We determine that an ESPRESSO-like setup of instrumental configuration
and sensitivity might retrieve DR up to $V = 12$, compared to $V = 10$ for
HARPS. We reach no clear conclusion about limb-dependent convective effects and
the possible confusion with DR; preliminary results suggest, however, that
under certain circumstances, while it seems that one effect could be mistaken
for the other, the accuracy of the fit (in particular of $\alpha$) does not
hold up under additional scrutiny.

amplitude modulation by accepting intersymbol interference, where an equalizer
is needed at the receiver. Since the complexity of an optimal equalizer
increases exponentially with the number of the interfering symbols, practical
truncated equalizers assume shorter memory. The power of the resulting residual
interference depends on the transmit filter and limits the performance of
truncated equalizers. In this paper, we use numerical optimizations and the
prolate spheroidal wave functions to find optimal time-limited pulses that
achieve minimum residual interference. Compared to root raised cosine pulses,
the new pulses decrease the residual interference by an order of magnitude, for
example, a decrease by 32 dB is achieved for an equalizer that considers four
interfering symbols at 57% faster transmissions. As a proof of concept, for the
57% faster transmissions of binary symbols, we showed that using the new pulse
with a 4-state equalizer has better bit error rate performance compared to

Recently, some works have shown that robustness against adversarial attacks can
also be distilled effectively to achieve good rates of robustness on
mobile-friendly models. In this work, however, we take a different point of
view, and show that knowledge distillation can be used directly to boost the
performance of state-of-the-art models in adversarial robustness. In this
sense, we present a thorough analysis and provide general guidelines to distill
knowledge from a robust teacher and boost the clean and adversarial performance
of a student model even further. To that end, we present Adversarial Knowledge
Distillation (AKD), a new framework to improve a model's robust performance,
consisting on adversarially training a student on a mixture of the original
labels and the teacher outputs. Through carefully controlled ablation studies,
we show that using early-stopping, model ensembles and weak adversarial
training are key techniques to maximize performance of the student, and show
that these insights generalize across different robust distillation techniques.
Finally, we provide insights on the effect of robust knowledge distillation on

boosting the accuracy of existing network modules. However, the extracted
class-level information was simply concatenated to pixel features, without
explicitly being exploited for better pixel representation learning. Moreover,
these approaches learn soft class centers based on coarse mask prediction,
which is prone to error accumulation. In this paper, aiming to use class level
information more effectively, we propose a universal Class-Aware Regularization
(CAR) approach to optimize the intra-class variance and inter-class distance
during feature learning, motivated by the fact that humans can recognize an
object by itself no matter which other objects it appears with. Three novel
loss functions are proposed. The first loss function encourages more compact
class representations within each class, the second directly maximizes the
distance between different class centers, and the third further pushes the
distance between inter-class centers and pixels. Furthermore, the class center
in our approach is directly generated from ground truth instead of from the
error-prone coarse prediction. Our method can be easily applied to most
existing segmentation models during training, including OCR and CPNet, and can
largely improve their accuracy at no additional inference overhead. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies conducted on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CAR can boost the accuracy of all baseline models
by up to 2.23% mIOU with superior generalization ability. The complete code is

physics. The ability to tune such interactions would open the possibility to

moir\'e superlattices formed by two-dimensional materials have emerged as a
promising platform for quantum engineering such phenomena. The power of the
moir\'e system lies in the high tunability of its physical parameters by
tweaking layer twist angle, electrical field, moir\'e carrier filling, and
interlayer coupling. Here, we report that optical excitation can drastically
tune the spin-spin interactions between moir\'e trapped carriers, resulting in
ferromagnetic order in WS2/WSe2 moir\'e superlattices over a small range of
doping at elevated temperatures. Near the filling factor v = -1/3 (i.e., one
hole per three moir\'e unit cells), as the excitation power at the exciton
resonance increases, a well-developed hysteresis loop emerges in the reflective
magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD) signal as a function of magnetic field, a
hallmark of ferromagnetism. The hysteresis loop persists down to charge
neutrality, and its shape evolves as the moir\'e superlattice is gradually
filled, indicating changes of magnetic ground state properties. The observed
phenomenon points to a mechanism in which itinerant photo-excited excitons
mediate exchange coupling between moir\'e trapped holes. This exciton-mediated
interaction can be of longer range than direct coupling between moir\'e trapped
holes, and thus magnetic order can arise even in the dilute hole regime under
optical excitation. This discovery adds a new and dynamic tuning knob to the
rich many-body Hamiltonian of moir\'e quantum matter.

enables incorporating specific properties into the value estimator that can
enhance learning. The second principle, on the other hand, allows for the value
function to be represented as a composition of multiple utility functions. This
can be leveraged for various purposes, e.g. dealing with highly varying reward
scales, incorporating a priori knowledge about the sources of reward, and
ensemble learning. Combining the two principles yields a general blueprint for
instantiating convergent algorithms by orchestrating diverse mapping functions
over multiple reward channels. This blueprint generalizes and subsumes
algorithms such as Q-Learning, Log Q-Learning, and Q-Decomposition. In
addition, our convergence proof for this general class relaxes certain required
assumptions in some of these algorithms. Based on our theory, we discuss
several interesting configurations as special cases. Finally, to illustrate the
potential of the design space that our theory opens up, we instantiate a
particular algorithm and evaluate its performance on the Atari suite.

suppresses competing loss processes. The concept is illustrated by
computational studies for the heptazine-H2O complex. The excited-state
landscape of this complex has been characterized with ab initio
electronic-structure methods and the proton-coupled electron-transfer dynamics
has been explored with nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. A unique feature of
the heptazine chromophore is the existence of a low-lying and exceptionally
long-lived 1{\pi}{\pi}* state in which a substantial part of the photon energy
can be stored for hundreds of nanoseconds and is available for the oxidation of

density planet orbiting an M dwarf (M0V). It orbits a solar-metallicity M dwarf
discovered using TESS photometry and confirmed with precise radial velocities

$R_{\oplus}$ and mass of $85.3^{+8.8}_{-8.7}$ $M_{\oplus}$, not only does this
object add to the small sample of gas giants ($\sim 10$) around M dwarfs, but
also, its low density ($\rho =$ $0.27^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ $\textrm{g~cm}^{-3}$)
provides an opportunity to test theories of planet formation. We present two
hypotheses to explain its low density; first, we posit that the low metallicity
of its stellar host ($\sim$ 0.3 dex lower than the median metallicity of M
dwarfs hosting gas giants) could have played a role in the delayed formation of
a solid core massive enough to initiate runaway accretion. Second, using the
eccentricity estimate of $0.14 \pm 0.06$ we determine it is also plausible for
tidal heating to at least partially be responsible for inflating the radius of
TOI-3757b b. The low density and large scale height of TOI-3757 b makes it an
excellent target for transmission spectroscopy studies of atmospheric escape
and composition (TSM $\sim$ 190). We use HPF to perform transmission
spectroscopy of TOI-3757 b using the helium 10830 \AA~ line. Doing this, we
place an upper limit of 6.9 \% (with 90\% confidence) on the maximum depth of
the absorption from the metastable transition of He at $\sim$ 10830 \AA, which
can help constraint the atmospheric mass loss rate in this energy limited

(EFCE). This is NP-hard in the general case and has been studied in special
cases, most notably triangle-free games, which include all two-player games
with public chance moves. However, the general case is not well understood, and
algorithms usually scale poorly. First, we introduce the correlation DAG, a
representation of the space of correlated strategies whose size is dependent on
the specific solution concept. It extends the team belief DAG of Zhang et al.
to general-sum games. For each of the three solution concepts, its size depends
exponentially only on a parameter related to the game's information structure.
We also prove a fundamental complexity gap: while our size bounds for NFCCE are
similar to those achieved in the case of team games by Zhang et al., this is
impossible to achieve for the other two concepts under standard complexity
assumptions. Second, we propose a two-sided column generation approach to
compute optimal correlated strategies. Our algorithm improves upon the
one-sided approach of Farina et al. by means of a new decomposition of
correlated strategies which allows players to re-optimize their sequence-form
strategies with respect to correlation plans which were previously added to the
support. Our techniques outperform the prior state of the art for computing
optimal general-sum correlated equilibria. For team games, the two-sided column
generation approach vastly outperforms standard column generation approaches,
making it the state of the art algorithm when the parameter is large. Along the
way we also introduce two new benchmark games: a trick-taking game that
emulates the endgame phase of the card game bridge, and a ride-sharing game.

requiring multiple bounces of ray tracing, making it possible to estimate
material properties even for scenes with complex lightings and geometries. We

proprieties to increase the parallelism and speed of computation.
Unfortunately, besides being intrinsically noisy, qubits have also been shown
to be highly susceptible to external sources of faults, such as ionizing
radiation. The latest discoveries highlight a much higher radiation sensitivity
of qubits than traditional transistors and identify a much more complex fault
model than bit-flip. We propose a framework to identify the quantum circuits
sensitivity to radiation-induced faults and the probability for a fault in a
qubit to propagate to the output. Based on the latest studies and radiation
experiments performed on real quantum machines, we model the transient faults
in a qubit as a phase shift with a parametrized magnitude. Additionally, our
framework can inject multiple qubit faults, tuning the phase shift magnitude
based on the proximity of the qubit to the particle strike location. As we show
in the paper, the proposed fault injector is highly flexible, and it can be
used on both quantum circuit simulators and real quantum machines. We report
the finding of more than 285M injections on the Qiskit simulator and 53K
injections on real IBM machines. We consider three quantum algorithms and
identify the faults and qubits that are more likely to impact the output. We
also consider the fault propagation dependence on the circuit scale, showing
that the reliability profile for some quantum algorithms is scale-dependent,
with increased impact from radiation-induced faults as we increase the number
of qubits. Finally, we also consider multi qubits faults, showing that they are
much more critical than single faults. The fault injector and the data
presented in this paper are available in a public repository to allow further
analysis.

represent a promising probe of large-scale structure in the universe. However,
cosmological 21-cm signal is challenging to observe due to astrophysical
foregrounds which are several orders of magnitude brighter. Traditional linear
foreground removal methods can optimally remove foregrounds for a known
telescope response but are sensitive to telescope systematic errors such as
antenna gain and delay errors, leaving foreground contamination in the
recovered signal. Non-linear methods such as principal component analysis, on
the other hand, have been used successfully for foreground removal, but they
lead to signal loss that is difficult to characterize and requires careful
analysis. In this paper, we present a systematics-robust foreground removal
technique which combines both linear and non-linear methods. We first obtain
signal and foreground estimates using a linear filter. Under the assumption
that the signal estimate is contaminated by foreground residuals induced by
parameterizable systematic effects, we infer the systematics-induced
contamination by cross-correlating the initial signal and foreground estimates.
Correcting for the inferred error, we are able to subtract foreground
contamination from the linearly filtered signal up to the first order in the
amplitude of the telescope systematics. In simulations of an interferometric
21-cm survey, our algorithm removes foreground leakage induced by complex gain
errors by one to two orders of magnitude in the power spectrum. Our technique
thus eases the requirements on telescope characterization for modern and
next-generation 21-cm cosmology experiments.

scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new
challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which
serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud
realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) Strong backbone
design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed
for LiDAR point clouds. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We
observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms are incapable of handling
complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions
and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering
module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on the fly for
different instances. 3) Extension to 4D prediction. Furthermore, we extend
DS-Net to 4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation by the temporally unified instance
clustering on aligned LiDAR frames. To comprehensively evaluate the performance
of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from
two large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DS-Net achieves superior
accuracies over current state-of-the-art methods in both tasks. Notably, in the

the maximum modeled wind speed also tends to increase. Wave models tuned to
coarser wind fields tend to overestimate the wave growth under strong winds. A
recently developed semi-empirical parameterization of the Charnock parameter,
which controls the roughness length over surface waves, substantially reduces
the aerodynamic drag of waves in high winds (above a threshold of 30 m/s). Here
we apply the formulation in a recent version of the wave model WAM (Cycle 4.7),
which uses a modified version of the physics parameterizations by Ardhuin et al
(2010) as well as subgrid obstructions for better performance around complex
topography. The new Charnock formulation is tested with wind forcing from
NORA3, a recently completed non-hydrostatic atmospheric downscaling of the
global reanalysis ERA5 for the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents
Sea. Such high-resolution atmospheric model integrations tend to have stronger
(and more realistic) upper-percentile winds than what is typically found in
coarser atmospheric models. A two-year comparison (2011-2012) of a control run
against the run with the modified Charnock parameter shows a dramatic reduction
of the wave height bias in high-wind cases. The added computational cost of the
new physics and the reduction of the Charnock parameter compared to the earlier

specifically on the decay modes $B\to D^{*+}\ell^- \bar{\nu}$ with $\ell = e,
\mu,$ and $\tau$. The world averages of the ratios $R_D$ and $R_D^{*}$
currently differ from the Standard Model (SM) by $3.4\sigma$ while $\Delta
A_{FB} = A_{FB}(B\to D^{*} \mu\nu) - A_{FB} (B\to D^{*} e \nu)$ is found to be
$4.1\sigma$ away from the SM prediction in an analysis of 2019 Belle data.
These intriguing results suggest an urgent need for improved simulation and
analysis techniques in $B\to D^{*+}\ell^- \bar{\nu}$ decays. Here we describe a
Monte Carlo Event-generator tool based on EVTGEN developed to allow simulation
of the NP signatures in $B\to D^*\ell^- \nu$, which arise due to the
interference between the SM and NP amplitudes. As a demonstration of the
proposed approach, we exhibit some examples of NP couplings that are consistent
with current data and could explain the $\Delta A_{FB}$ anomaly in $B\to
D^*\ell^- \nu$ while remaining consistent with other constraints. We show that
the $\Delta$-type observables such as $\Delta A_{FB}$ and $\Delta S_5$
eliminate most QCD uncertainties from form factors and allow for clean
measurements of NP. We introduce correlated observables that improve the
sensitivity to NP. We discuss prospects for improved observables sensitive to
NP couplings with the expected 50 ab$^{-1}$ of Belle II data, which seems to be
ideally suited for this class of measurements.

after being pre-trained by language supervision from a large amount of
image-caption pairs, CLIP itself should also have acquired some few-shot

CLIP can be a strong vision-language few-shot learner by leveraging the power
of language. We first evaluate CLIP's zero-shot performance on a typical visual
question answering task and demonstrate a zero-shot cross-modality transfer
capability of CLIP on the visual entailment task. Then we propose a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy to boost the few-shot performance on
the vqa task. We achieve competitive zero/few-shot results on the visual

efficiently demonstrated to a robot. In contact-rich tasks, where position
trajectories alone may not be safe or robust over variation in contact

different task phases or degrees of freedom may require the tracking of either
position or force -- e.g., once contact is made, it may be more important to
track the force demonstration trajectory in the contact direction. The robot
impedance balances between following a position or force reference trajectory,
where a high stiffness tracks position and a low stiffness tracks force. This
paper proposes using DMPs to learn position and force trajectories from
demonstrations, then adapting the impedance parameters online with a
higher-level control policy trained by reinforcement learning. This allows
one-shot demonstration of the task with DMPs, and improved robustness and
performance from the impedance adaptation. The approach is validated on
peg-in-hole and adhesive strip application tasks.

entanglement in realistic quantum devices. Measurement-device-independent
nonlinear entanglement witnesses (MDI-NEWs) are a kind of entanglement
witnesses which eliminate dependence on the correct alignments of measurement
devices for guaranteeing the existence of entanglement and also detect more
entangled states than their linear counterparts. While this method guarantees
entanglement independent of measurement alignments, they are still prone to
serving wrong results due to other loopholes. Here we study the response of
MDI-NEWs to two categories of faults occurring in experiments. In the first
category, the detection loophole, characterized by lost and additional events
of outcomes of measurements, is investigated, and bounds which guarantee
entanglement are obtained in terms of the efficiency of measurement being
performed. In the second category, we study noise associated with the sets of
additional quantum inputs required in MDI-NEW scenarios. In this case, a type
of noise is identified which still allows the MDI-NEWs to guarantee
entanglement. We also show that MDI-NEWs are less or equally robust in
comparison to their linear counterparts under the same noise in additional
quantum inputs, although the former group detects a larger volume of entangled
states in the noiseless scenario than their linear cousins.

The ""glissandi"" effect is one such phenomenon, associated with a decrease in
infraslow fluctuations, in which synchronized calcium oscillations propagate as
a wave in hundreds of astrocytes. Nitric oxide molecules released from the
astrocytes contribute to synaptic functions on the basis of the underlying
astrocyte-neuron interaction network. In this study, by defining an
astrocyte-neuronal (A-N) unit as an integrated circuit of one neuron and one
astrocyte, we developed a minimal model of neuronal stimulus-dependent and
nitric oxide-mediated emergence of calcium waves in astrocytes. Incorporating
inter-unit communication via nitric oxide molecules, a coupled network of 1,000
such A-N units is developed in which multiple stable regimes were found to
emerge in astrocytes. We examined the ranges of neuronal stimulus strength and
the coupling strength between A-N units that give rise to such dynamical
behaviors. We also report that there exists a range of coupling strength,
wherein units not receiving stimulus also start showing oscillations and become
synchronized. Our results support the hypothesis that glissandi-like phenomena
exhibiting synchronized calcium oscillations in astrocytes help in efficient
synaptic transmission by reducing the energy demand of the process.

high-order derivative terms, where the former serves as the spatial filter and
the latter is viewed as the residual noise canceller to further improve the
speech quality. To enable end-to-end training, we replace the derivative
operations with trainable networks and thus can learn from training data.
Extensive experiments are conducted on the synthesized dataset based on

translate forward and laterally, rotate and generate a stresslet flow. We
identify the predator's best squirming sequences to achieve the time-optimal
(TO) and efficiency-optimal (EO) predation. For a point prey, the TO squirmer
executing translational motions favours a two-fold L-shaped trajectory that
enables it to exploit the disturbance flow for accelerated predation; using a
stresslet mode significantly expedites the EO predation, allowing the predator
to catch the prey faster yet with lower energy consumption and higher predatory
efficiency; the predator can harness its stresslet disturbance flow to suck the
prey towards itself; compared to a translating predator, its compeer combining
translation and rotation is less time--efficient, and the latter occasionally
achieves the TO predation via retreating in order to advance. We also adopt RL
to reproduce the globally-optimal predatory strategy of chasing a point prey,
qualitatively capturing the crucial two--fold attribute of TO path. Using a
numerically emulated RL environment, we explore the dependence of the optimal

manually rated, on a scale 0 (none) to 3 (highest), the specific accessibility

accessibility violations were prevalent across states but to varying degrees
for a specific accessibility criterion. Although violations were detected in
all 4 POUR accessibility principles, the most number of known violations
occurred in meeting the perceivability and operability principles. Most

determine to what extent pure electronic excitations with a small number of
electrons per period can be generated by the different drives. When the
superconducting gap is small compared to the drive frequency, the junction
behaves like a normal-metal junction and minimal excess noise is reached for
Lorentzian voltage drives carrying an integer charge (levitons). In the
opposite regime of a large-gap, the excess noise vanishes for half-quantized
levitons, giving rise to the perfect transmission of a Cooper pair on the
superconducting side. This microscopic approach also allows us to address the

allowing us to study the non-trivial interplay between Andreev reflection and

correction. Here, we perform quantum error correction on superconducting qubits

Furthermore, by using dynamic circuits and classical computation as part of our

impact of energy relaxation error in the syndrome and flag qubits. We show that
the logical error varies depending on the use of a perfect matching decoder
compared to a maximum likelihood decoder. We observe a logical error per

low as $\sim0.03$ for the maximum likelihood decoder. Our results suggest that
more significant improvements to decoders are likely on the horizon as quantum

data scientists employ two main approaches, namely One-Class (OC)
classification and Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning. The former only learns
from labeled positive data, whereas the latter also utilizes unlabeled data to
improve the overall performance. Since PU learning utilizes more data, we might
be prone to think that when unlabeled data is available, the go-to algorithms
should always come from the PU group. However, we find that this is not always
the case if unlabeled data is unreliable, i.e. contains limited or biased
latent negative data. We perform an extensive experimental study of a wide list
of state-of-the-art OC and PU algorithms in various scenarios as far as
unlabeled data reliability is concerned. Furthermore, we propose PU
modifications of state-of-the-art OC algorithms that are robust to unreliable
unlabeled data, as well as a guideline to similarly modify other OC algorithms.
Our main practical recommendation is to use state-of-the-art PU algorithms when
unlabeled data is reliable and to use the proposed modifications of
state-of-the-art OC algorithms otherwise. Additionally, we outline procedures
to distinguish the cases of reliable and unreliable unlabeled data using

Learning-based systems have the potential to outperform classical
implementations in challenging environments, but, currently, do not perform as
well as classical methods in nominal settings. Herein, we introduce a framework
for training a hybrid VIO system that leverages the advantages of learning and
standard filtering-based state estimation. Our approach is built upon a

neural network-derived relative pose measurement model. The use of the Kalman
filter framework enables the principled treatment of uncertainty at training

outperforms a similar, supervised method, while also enabling online
retraining. We evaluate our system on a visually degraded version of the EuRoC
dataset and find that our estimator operates without a significant reduction in
accuracy in cases where classical estimators consistently diverge. Finally, by
properly utilizing the metric information contained in the IMU measurements,
our system is able to recover metric scene scale, while other self-supervised
monocular VIO approaches cannot.

Dantzig selector have become ubiquitous in the engineering practice, including
in medical imaging. Among other tasks, they have been successfully applied for
the estimation of neuronal activity from functional magnetic resonance data
without prior knowledge of the stimulus or activation timing, utilizing an
approximate knowledge of the hemodynamic response to local neuronal activity.
These methods work by generating a parametric family of solutions with
different sparsity, among which an ultimate choice is made using an information
criteria. We propose a novel approach, that instead of selecting a single
option from the family of regularized solutions, utilizes the whole family of
such sparse regression solutions. Namely, their ensemble provides a first
approximation of probability of activation at each time-point, and together
with the conditional neuronal activity distributions estimated with the theory
of mixtures with varying concentrations, they serve as the inputs to a Bayes
classifier eventually deciding on the verity of activation at each time-point.
We show in extensive numerical simulations that this new method performs
favourably in comparison with standard approaches in a range of realistic
scenarios. This is mainly due to the avoidance of overfitting and underfitting
that commonly plague the solutions based on sparse regression combined with
model selection methods, including the corrected Akaike Information Criterion.
This advantage is finally documented in selected fMRI task datasets.

  valence gap",,,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Recent advances in transformer-based architectures which are pre-trained in
self-supervised manner have shown great promise in several machine learning
tasks. In the audio domain, such architectures have also been successfully
utilised in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER). However, existing
works have not evaluated the influence of model size and pre-training data on
downstream performance, and have shown limited attention to generalisation,
robustness, fairness, and efficiency. The present contribution conducts a
thorough analysis of these aspects on several pre-trained variants of wav2vec
2.0 and HuBERT that we fine-tuned on the dimensions arousal, dominance, and
valence of MSP-Podcast, while additionally using IEMOCAP and MOSI to test
cross-corpus generalisation. To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the top
performance for valence prediction without use of explicit linguistic
information, with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of .638 on
MSP-Podcast. Furthermore, our investigations reveal that transformer-based
architectures are more robust to small perturbations compared to a CNN-based
baseline and fair with respect to biological sex groups, but not towards
individual speakers. Finally, we are the first to show that their extraordinary
success on valence is based on implicit linguistic information learnt during
fine-tuning of the transformer layers, which explains why they perform on-par
with recent multimodal approaches that explicitly utilise textual information.
Our findings collectively paint the following picture: transformer-based
architectures constitute the new state-of-the-art in SER, but further advances
are needed to mitigate remaining robustness and individual speaker issues. To
make our findings reproducible, we release the best performing model to the
community.

constitutive parameters already in the isotropic linear elastic case. Although
it is clear that these parameters are related to predicted size effects, the
individual meaning of single parameters has been rather unclear. The present
work tries to elucidate the interpretation of the constitutive relations and

the goal is to predict missing entries from partial observations. However,
existing methods often make the explicit or implicit assumption that the
observed entries are noise-free to provide a theoretical guarantee of exact
recovery of missing entries, which is quite restrictive in practice. To remedy
such drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel noisy tensor completion model,
which complements the incompetence of existing works in handling the
degeneration of high-order and noisy observations. Specifically, the tensor
ring nuclear norm (TRNN) and least-squares estimator are adopted to regularize
the underlying tensor and the observed entries, respectively. In addition, a
non-asymptotic upper bound of estimation error is provided to depict the
statistical performance of the proposed estimator. Two efficient algorithms are
developed to solve the optimization problem with convergence guarantee, one of
which is specially tailored to handle large-scale tensors by replacing the
minimization of TRNN of the original tensor equivalently with that of a much
smaller one in a heterogeneous tensor decomposition framework. Experimental
results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed model in recovering noisy incomplete tensor data
compared with state-of-the-art tensor completion models.

  Reflectometry",,,,,"eess.SP physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) is the basis for distributed
time-domain optical fiber sensing techniques. By injecting pulse light into an
optical fiber, the distance information of an event can be obtained based on
the time of light flight. The minimum distinguishable event separation along
the fiber length is called the spatial resolution, which is determined by the
optical pulse width. By reducing the pulse width, the spatial resolution can be
improved. However, at the same time, the signal-to-noise ratio of the system is
degraded, and higher speed equipment is required. To solve this problem, data
processing methods such as iterative subdivision, deconvolution, and neural
networks have been proposed. However, they all have some shortcomings and thus
have not been widely applied. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate
an OTDR deconvolution neural network based on deep convolutional neural
networks. A simplified OTDR model is built to generate a large amount of
training data. By optimizing the network structure and training data, an
effective OTDR deconvolution is achieved. The simulation and experimental
results show that the proposed neural network can achieve more accurate
deconvolution than the conventional deconvolution algorithm with a higher
signal-to-noise ratio.

decomposed components for driver fatigue recognition. In this work, we propose
a novel decomposition-based hybrid ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN)

discrete wavelet transform-based ensemble CNN achieved the highest average

principle is to make the heat balance for the air volume of a room space
considered at uniform temperature and to calculate from this equation the load,
i.e. the power needed to obtain the required indoor temperature. The problem is
that, by doing so, the physical causality is not respected. If the model is
approximated by a piecewise linear dynamical system, this procedure results in
an improper transfer function. In order to point out this problem, a method to
obtain state space and transfer function models from thermal networks is
introduced. Then, the transfer function representation is employed to show that
changing the physical causality results in an improper transfer function. The
practical consequence is that when the space temperature has a step variation,
the calculated load tends to infinity if the simulation time step tends to
zero. The issue of causality may be a problem in equation-based simulation

commercial devices. Deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to analyze these
signals because of their high accuracy rate. However, researchers have found
that adversarial attacks can significantly reduce the accuracy of DNNs. Studies
have been conducted to defend ECG-based DNNs against traditional adversarial
attacks, such as projected gradient descent (PGD), and smooth adversarial
perturbation (SAP) which targets ECG classification; however, to the best of
our knowledge, no study has completely explored the defense against adversarial
attacks targeting ECG classification. Thus, we did different experiments to
explore the effects of defense methods against white-box adversarial attack and
black-box adversarial attack targeting ECG classification, and we found that
some common defense methods performed well against these attacks. Besides, we
proposed a new defense method called Adversarial Distillation Training (ADT)
which comes from defensive distillation and can effectively improve the
generalization performance of DNNs. The results show that our method performed
more effectively against adversarial attacks targeting on ECG classification
than the other baseline methods, namely, adversarial training, defensive

Furthermore, we found that our method performed better against PGD attacks with

conditions, challenging weathers and external adversarial perturbations, are
inevitable in real self-driving applications. Existing researches and testings
have shown that they can severely influence the vehicles perception ability and
performance, one of the main issue is the false positive detection, i.e., the
ghost object which is not real existed or occurs in the wrong position (such as
a non-existent vehicle). Traditional navigation methods tend to avoid every
detected objects for safety, however, avoiding a ghost object may lead the
vehicle into a even more dangerous situation, such as a sudden break on the
highway. Considering the various disturbance types, it is difficult to address
this issue at the perceptual aspect. A potential solution is to detect the
ghost through relation learning among the whole scenario and develop an
integrated end-to-end navigation system. Our underlying logic is that the
behavior of all vehicles in the scene is influenced by their neighbors, and
normal vehicles behave in a logical way, while ghost vehicles do not. By
learning the spatio-temporal relation among surrounding vehicles, an
information reliability representation is learned for each detected vehicle and
then a robot navigation network is developed. In contrast to existing works, we
encourage the network to learn how to represent the reliability and how to
aggregate all the information with uncertainties by itself, thus increasing the
efficiency and generalizability. To the best of the authors knowledge, this
paper provides the first work on using graph relation learning to achieve
end-to-end robust navigation in the presence of ghost vehicles. Simulation

to reveal its cellular and chemical composition. This process requires precise
specimen collection, handling infectious human waste, controlled urine storage,
and timely transportation to modern laboratory equipment for analysis.
Holographic lens free imaging (LFI) can measure large volumes of urine via a
simple and compact optical setup, potentially enabling automatic urine analysis
at the patient bedside. We introduce an LFI system capable of resolving
important urine clinical biomarkers such as red blood cells, white blood cells,

the particulate concentrations relevant for detecting several clinical urine
abnormalities such as hematuria, pyuria, and bacteriuria. We show bacteria

insensitive to changes in bacteria concentrations of over seven orders of

UTI-negative urine from human patients. Together, these results show promise
for LFI as a tool for urine screening, potentially offering early,

Darwinian Evolution, Human History and SETI into a single mathematical scheme:
1) Darwinian Evolution over the last 3.5 billion years is defined as one
particular realization of a certain stochastic process called Geometric
Brownian Motion (GBM). This GBM yields the fluctuations in time of the number
of species living on Earth. Its mean value curve is an increasing exponential
curve, i.e. the exponential growth of Evolution. 2) In 2008 this author
provided the statistical generalization of the Drake equation yielding the
number N of communicating ET civilizations in the Galaxy. N was shown to follow
the lognormal probability distribution. 3) We call ""b-lognormals"" those
lognormals starting at any positive time b (""birth"") larger than zero. Then the
exponential growth curve becomes the geometric locus of the peaks of a
one-parameter family of b-lognormals: this is our way to re-define Cladistics.
4) b-lognormals may be also be interpreted as the lifespan of any living being
(a cell, or an animal, a plant, a human, or even the historic lifetime of any
civilization). Applying this new mathematical apparatus to Human History, leads
to the discovery of the exponential progress between Ancient Greece and the
current USA as the envelope of all b-lognormals of Western Civilizations over a
period of 2500 years. 5) We then invoke Shannon's Information Theory. The
b-lognormals' entropy turns out to be the index of ""development level"" reached
by each historic civilization. We thus get a numerical estimate of the entropy
difference between any two civilizations, like the Aztec-Spaniard difference in
1519. 6) In conclusion, we have derived a mathematical scheme capable of
estimating how much more advanced than Humans an Alien Civilization will be
when the SETI scientists will detect the first hints about ETs.
