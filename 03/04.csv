modification of the Schrodinger equation incorporating gravitational
self-interaction. However, there is no evidence yet as to whether nature
actually behaves this way. This work investigates a possible way to
experimentally test gravitational self-interaction. The effect of self-gravity
on interference of massive particles is studied by numerically solving the
Schrodinger-Newton equation for a particle passing through a double-slit. The
results show that the presence of gravitational self-interaction has an effect
on the fringe width of the interference that can be tested in matter-wave
interferometry experiments. Notably, this approach can distinguish between
gravitational self-interaction and environment induced decoherence, as the
latter does not affect the fringe width. This result will also provide a way to
test if gravity requires to be quantized on the scale of ordinary quantum
mechanics.

$\overline{ab}$ and the curve of $P$ in between $s$ and $t$. Using
$O(n\log^2n)$ storage, such queries take $O(\log^3 n)$ time, simplifying and
significantly improving previous results. We then generalize our results to
query segments of arbitrary orientation. We present an
$O(nk^{3+\varepsilon}+n^2)$ size data structure, where $k \in [1..n]$ is a

compute a local $\delta$-simplification (with respect to the Fr\'{e}chet

interface or under spatial confinement, then the density becomes spatially
inhomogeneous. Although the one-body density provides much useful information,
a higher level of resolution is provided by the two-body correlations. These
give a statistical description of the internal microstructure of the fluid and
enable calculation of the average interparticle force, which plays an essential
role in determining both the equilibrium and dynamic properties of interacting
fluids. We present a theoretical framework for the description of inhomogeneous
(classical) many-body systems, based explicitly on the two-body correlation
functions. By consideration of local Noether-invariance against spatial
distortion of the system we demonstrate the fundamental status of the
Yvon-Born-Green (YBG) equation as a local force-balance within the fluid. Using
the inhomogeneous Ornstein-Zernike equation we show that the two-body
correlations are density functionals and, thus, that the average interparticle
force entering the YBG equation is also a functional of the one-body density.
The force-based theory we develop provides an alternative to standard density
functional theory for the study of inhomogeneous systems both in- and
out-of-equilibrium. We compare force-based density profiles to the results of
the standard potential-based (dynamical) density functional theory. In
equilibrium, we confirm both analytically and numerically that the standard
approach yields profiles that are consistent with the compressibility pressure,
whereas the force-density functional gives profiles consistent with the virial
pressure. The structure of the theory offers deep insights into the nature of
correlation in dense and inhomogeneous systems.

targets for LHC discovery, incorporating a co-annihilation partner for
detectable thermal relic dark matter, and capable of mediating the potential
muon $g-2$ anomaly. This is accomplished by a modestly hierarchical spectrum,
with sub-TeV sleptons and electroweakinos and with multi-TeV masses for the
other new states. We study new elements in the UV MSSM realization of Sleptonic
SUSY based on higher-dimensional sequestering and the synergy between the
resulting gaugino-mediation, hypercharge $D$-term mediation and Higgs-mediation
of SUSY-breaking, so as to more fully capture the range of possibilities. This
framework stands out by harmoniously solving the flavor, CP and $\mu - B\mu$
problems of the supersymmetric paradigm. We discuss its extension to orbifold
GUTs, including gauge-coupling and $b$-tau unification. We also develop a
non-minimal model with extra Higgs fields, in which the electroweak vacuum is
more readily cosmologically stable against decay to a charge-breaking vacuum,
allowing a broader range of sleptonic spectra than in the MSSM alone. We survey
the rich set of signals possible at the LHC and future colliders, covering both
$R$-parity conservation and violation, as well as for dark matter detection.
While the multi-TeV squarks imply a Little Hierarchy Problem, intriguingly,
small changes in parameter space to improve naturalness result in dramatic
phase transitions to either electroweak-preservation or charge-breaking. In a
Multiverse setting, the modest unnaturalness may then be explained by the
""principle of living dangerously"".

those methods based on extension, once the inhomogeneity is truncated we may
solve the PDE using any of the many simple, fast, and robust solvers that have
been developed for regular grids on simple domains. Function intension is
inherently stable, as are all steps in the proposed solution method, and can be
used on domains which do not readily admit extensions. We pay a price in
exchange for improved stability and flexibility: in addition to solving the PDE
on the regular domain, we must additionally (1) solve the PDE on a small
auxiliary domain that is fitted to the boundary, and (2) ensure consistency of
the solution across the interface between this auxiliary domain and the rest of
the physical domain. We show how these tasks may be accomplished efficiently
(in both the asymptotic and practical sense), and compare convergence to

quadrotors in formation, (ii) A real-time, computationally efficient CEM
navigation algorithm, (iii) Simulation and experimental algorithm validation.
Simulations were first performed with a team of six virtual quadrotors to
demonstrate velocity tracking via dynamic slide speed, maintaining sufficient
inter-agent distances, and operating in real-time. Flight tests with a team of
two custom quadrotors were performed in an indoor motion capture flight
facility, successfully validating that the navigation algorithm can handle
non-trivial bounded tracking errors while guaranteeing safety.

transitions, from lower to higher symmetry, upon heating. While structural
phase transitions have been investigated by a wide range of optical, thermal
and electrical methods, most measurements are quasi-static and hence do not
provide direct information regarding the fundamental timescale of phase
transitions in this emerging class of semiconductors. Here we investigate the
timescale of the orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition in the
prototypical metal halide perovskite, methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3
or MAPbI3) using cryogenic nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. By
using mid-infrared pump pulses to impulsively heat up the material at slightly
below the phase-transition temperature and probing the transient optical
response as a function of delay time, we observed a clean signature of a
transient, reversible orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition. The forward
phase transition is found to proceed at tens of nanoseconds timescale, after
which a backward phase transition progresses at a timescale commensurate with
heat dissipation from the film to the underlying substrate. A high degree of
transient phase transition is observed accounting for one third of the
steady-state phase transition. In comparison to fully inorganic phase-change
materials such as VO2, the orders of magnitude slower phase transition in
MAPbI3 can be attributed to the large energy barrier associated with the strong
hydrogen bonding between the organic cation and the inorganic framework. Our
approach paves the way for unraveling phase transition dynamics in MHPs and
other hybrid semiconducting materials.

with the biorthogonal basis for the non-Hermitian quantum systems. From the
general perturbation description with the constraint of parity-time (PT)
symmetry, we show that the fidelity $\mathcal{F}$ is always real for the
PT-unbroken states. For the PT-broken states, the real part of the fidelity
susceptibility $\mathrm{Re}[\mathcal{X}_F]$ is corresponding to considering
both the PT partner states, and the negative infinity is explored by the
perturbation theory when the parameter approaches the exceptional point (EP).
Moreover, at the second-order EP, we prove that the real part of the fidelity

$\mathrm{Re}\mathcal{F}=\frac{1}{2}$. Based on these general properties, we
study the two-legged non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the

abstraction. Unfortunately, type applications need to be implicit for a
language to be human-usable, and the problem of inferring all type applications

avoided impredicative type inference.
  We reformulate System F in terms of call-by-push-value, and study type
inference for it. Surprisingly, this new perspective yields a novel type
inference algorithm which is extremely simple to implement (not even requiring
unification), infers many types, and has a simple declarative specification.
Furthermore, our approach offers type theoretic explanations of how many of the
heuristics used in existing algorithms for impredicative polymorphism arise.

spatial perception. However, a place recognition in the wild often suffers from
erroneous predictions due to image variations, e.g., changing viewpoints and
street appearance. Integrating uncertainty estimation into the life cycle of
place recognition is a promising method to mitigate the impact of variations on
place recognition performance. However, existing uncertainty estimation
approaches in this vein are either computationally inefficient (e.g., Monte
Carlo dropout) or at the cost of dropped accuracy. This paper proposes STUN, a
self-teaching framework that learns to simultaneously predict the place and
estimate the prediction uncertainty given an input image. To this end, we first
train a teacher net using a standard metric learning pipeline to produce
embedding priors. Then, supervised by the pretrained teacher net, a student net
with an additional variance branch is trained to finetune the embedding priors
and estimate the uncertainty sample by sample. During the online inference
phase, we only use the student net to generate a place prediction in
conjunction with the uncertainty. When compared with place recognition systems
that are ignorant to the uncertainty, our framework features the uncertainty
estimation for free without sacrificing any prediction accuracy. Our
experimental results on the large-scale Pittsburgh30k dataset demonstrate that
STUN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both recognition accuracy and
the quality of uncertainty estimation.

end-to-end learnable nor real-time. These limitations are addressed by the
recent VIS transformer (VisTR) which performs VIS end-to-end within a clip.
However, VisTR suffers from long training time due to its frame-wise dense
attention. In addition, VisTR is not fully end-to-end learnable in multiple
video clips as it requires a hand-crafted data association to link instance
tracklets between successive clips. This paper proposes EfficientVIS, a fully

tracklet query and tracklet proposal that associate and segment
regions-of-interest (RoIs) across space and time by an iterative query-video

  - We give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for a diversified
search ranking problem [Bansal et al., ICALP 2010] whose objective is to
minimizes the discounted cumulative gain. Our PTAS runs in time
$n^{2^{O(\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon)}} \cdot m^{O(1)}$ where $n$ denotes the
number of elements in the databases. Complementing this, we show that no PTAS
can run in time $f(\epsilon) \cdot (nm)^{2^{o(1/\epsilon)}}$ assuming Gap-ETH;
therefore our running time is nearly tight. Both of our bounds answer open
questions of Bansal et al.
  - We next consider the Max-Sum Dispersion problem, whose objective is to
select $k$ out of $n$ elements that maximizes the dispersion, which is defined
as the sum of the pairwise distances under a given metric. We give a
quasipolynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem which runs in time
$n^{O_{\epsilon}(\log n)}$. This improves upon previously known polynomial-time
algorithms with approximate ratios 0.5 [Hassin et al., Oper. Res. Lett. 1997;
Borodin et al., ACM Trans. Algorithms 2017]. Furthermore, we observe that known
reductions rule out approximation schemes that run in
$n^{\tilde{o}_\epsilon(\log n)}$ time assuming ETH.
  - We consider a generalization of Max-Sum Dispersion called Max-Sum
Diversification. In addition to the sum of pairwise distance, the objective
includes another function $f$. For monotone submodular $f$, we give a
quasipolynomial-time algorithm with approximation ratio arbitrarily close to
$(1 - 1/e)$. This improves upon the best polynomial-time algorithm which has
approximation ratio $0.5$ by Borodin et al. Furthermore, the $(1 - 1/e)$ factor

justification for the limitations of Bayesian learning when the model is

introduce free energy metrics that account for the performance of ensemble

delay-coincidence detection for electron antineutrinos possible. The

that the LiCl solution is practicable for a 10-m diameter detector for solar

The particular nature of such behavioral changes induced by social interaction,
and their underlying cognitive processes in the human brain are, however, still

demonstrate that it is possible to replicate human behavioral data in both

fact exist on a continuum. At the same time an analysis of the neural
activation traces of the trained networks provides evidence that information is

robustness, which consists of seeking invariance / insensitivity of model
performance to hidden factors of variations in the data. Towards this end, we
employ a two step strategy that a) does unsupervised discovery, via generative

intervenes models to make their performance invariant to these sensitive

We evaluate our method using metrics that measure trade offs between invariance

analyses in a robust determination of the heavy-elements distribution in
Jupiter's envelope. In this paper, we assemble the most comprehensive and
diverse collection of Jupiter interior models to date and use it to study the
distribution of heavy elements in the planet's envelope. We apply a Bayesian
statistical approach to our interior model calculations, reproducing the Juno
gravitational and atmospheric measurements and constraints from the deep zonal
flows. Our results show that the gravity constraints lead to a deep entropy of
Jupiter corresponding to a 1 bar temperature 5-15 K higher than traditionally
assumed. We also find that uncertainties in the equation of state are crucial
when determining the amount of heavy elements in Jupiter's interior. Our models
put an upper limit to the inner compact core of Jupiter of 7 Earth masses,
independently on the structure model (with or without dilute core) and the
equation of state considered. Furthermore, we robustly demonstrate that
Jupiter's envelope is inhomogenous, with a heavy-element enrichment in the
interior relative to the outer envelope. This implies that heavy element
enrichment continued through the gas accretion phase, with important
implications for the formation of giant planets in our solar system and beyond.

Euclidean continuation. We discuss some modifications of the gravitational path
integral that give Euclidean SdS a semiclassical equilibrium interpretation.
First we consider ""gravity in a cavity,"" defining the canonical ensemble in a
box that excises one horizon. However, this standard approach does not work for
positive cosmological constant: the solution of lowest free energy has a
negative heat capacity, which is inconsistent if it is to provide the leading
semiclassical contribution to a canonical partition function. Instead we modify
the boundary conditions in the path integral to construct the microcanonical
partition function, which appears to be well-defined. We then bring two
ensembles into contact and remove the boundary, producing states of a larger
microcanonical ensemble that contain, for example, both a black hole and a
cosmological horizon at once. These systems are closed and have no boundary,
but they must possess some form of mild metric discontinuity. We discuss the
case where the discontinuity is equivalent to the insertion of a thin, rigid
membrane, separating two systems that can exchange energy and are at local
equilibrium. Equilibrium configurations obtained in this way are found to be
thermodynamically unstable if they contain a black hole.

Without the use of class label information, we discover discriminative features

representation space by up to $40\%$ without significantly affecting linear
classification performance. We then propose Self-Supervised Representation

Q-Score can also be used as a regularization term on any pre-trained

Q-Score regularization can boost the linear classification performance of
state-of-the-art self-supervised models by up to 5.8% on ImageNet-100 and 3.7%

images depicting cornea guttata (Fuchs dystrophy), we propose a new deep
learning methodology that includes a novel attention mechanism named feedback
non-local attention (fNLA). Our approach first infers the cell edges, then
selects the cells that are well detected, and finally applies a postprocessing
method to correct mistakes and provide the binary segmentation from which the
corneal parameters are estimated (cell density [ECD], coefficient of variation
[CV], and hexagonality [HEX]). In this study, we analyzed 1203 images acquired
with a Topcon SP-1P microscope, 500 of which contained guttae. Manual
segmentation was performed in all images. We compared the results of different
networks (UNet, ResUNeXt, DenseUNets, UNet++) and found that DenseUNets with
fNLA provided the best performance, with a mean absolute error of 23.16
[cells/mm$^{2}$] in ECD, 1.28 [%] in CV, and 3.13 [%] in HEX, which was 3-6
times smaller than the error obtained by Topcon's built-in software. Our
approach handled the cells affected by guttae remarkably well, detecting cell
edges occluded by small guttae while discarding areas covered by large guttae.
Overall, the proposed method obtained accurate estimations in extremely
challenging specular images.

visualizing retinal layers and helps ophthalmologists to detect possible
diseases. Accurate and early diagnosis of common retinal diseases can prevent
the patients from suffering critical damages to their vision. Computer-aided

convolutional neural network for detecting retinal diseases from OCT images.
Our model generates rich and multi-resolution features by employing the
learning architectures of two robust convolutional models. Spatial resolution
is a critical factor in medical images, especially the OCT images that contain
tiny essential points. To empower our model, we apply a new post-architecture
model to our ensemble model for enhancing spatial resolution learning without
increasing computational costs. The introduced post-architecture model can be
deployed to any feature extraction model to improve the utilization of the
feature map's spatial values. We have collected two open-source datasets for
our experiments to make our models capable of detecting six crucial retinal
diseases: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Central Serous Retinopathy
(CSR), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic
Macular Edema (DME), and Drusen alongside the normal cases. Our experiments on
two datasets and comparing our model with some other well-known deep

the presence of a plethora of substructures in circumstellar disks (CSDs). One
of the most commonly observed substructures are concentric gaps that may hint
at the presence of embedded forming planets. However, direct detections of them
are rare, and thus ambiguity regarding the origin of most gap features remains.
The aim of this study is to investigate the capabilities of high-contrast
VIS/NIR imaging of directly detecting and characterizing low-mass giant planets
in gaps. To this end, a grid of models of protoplanetary disks was generated.
The models include a central T Tauri star surrounded by a face-on CSD harboring
an accreting planet, which itself is surrounded by a circumplanetary disk (CPD)
and carves a gap. We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Mol3D to
generate temperature distributions and synthetic observations. Based on these
simulations, we measured the impact the planet and its CPD have on contrast
curves and quantified the impact of the observing wavelength and of five key
parameters on the determined signal strength. Then, we applied a detection
criterion on our results and assess the capabilities of SPHERE/VLT of detecting
the embedded planets. We find that a part of the investigated parameter space
includes detectable planets, and we elaborate on the implications of a
non-detection. Furthermore, we analyze the potential loss of valuable
information by the use of a too small coronagraphic mask. However, we find this
outcome to be very unlikely. Finally, within the VIS/NIR we identify for each
of the investigated basic properties of the planets and the disks the most
promising observing wavelengths that enable us to distinguish between different
underlying parameter values. We find, that the detectability and the
characterization often benefit from different observing wavelengths.

pseudogapped non-linear excitations. We analyze the zero temperature limit of
the theory and the behavior of the bare masses and couplings on approaching the
mean field zero temperature critical point. Focusing on the so called replicon

makes it possible to target sparsity by working directly with $L_0$
regularization. We identify failure modes for regularized BO and develop a
hyperparameter-free method, sparsity exploring Bayesian optimization (SEBO)
that seeks to simultaneously maximize a target objective and sparsity. SEBO and

introduce a novel dataset, named TimberSeg 1.0, that is densely annotated,
i.e., that includes both bounding boxes and pixel-level mask annotations for
logs. This dataset comprises 220 images with 2500 individually segmented logs.
Using our dataset, we then compare three neural network architectures on the
task of individual logs detection and segmentation; two region-based methods
and one attention-based method. Unsurprisingly, our results show that
axis-aligned proposals, failing to take into account the directional nature of
logs, underperform with 19.03 mAP. A rotation-aware proposal method
significantly improve results to 31.83 mAP. More interestingly, a
Transformer-based approach, without any inductive bias on rotations,
outperformed the two others, achieving a mAP of 57.53 on our dataset. Our use
case demonstrates the limitations of region-based approaches for cluttered,
elongated objects. It also highlights the potential of attention-based methods
on this specific task, as they work directly at the pixel-level. These
encouraging results indicate that such a perception system could be used to
assist the operators on the short-term, or to fully automate log picking
operations in the future.

unified relation-aware embedding framework for attributed heterogeneous
multiplex networks. Our model incorporates node attributes, motif-based
features, relation-based GCN approaches, and relational self-attention to learn
embeddings of nodes with respect to the various relations in a heterogeneous,

embedding framework that embraces the multi-faceted nature of nodes in such
networks, producing a set of multi-embeddings that capture the varied and
diverse contexts of nodes.
  We evaluate our model on four real-world datasets from Amazon, Twitter,

very high sensitivity spectrum (RMS noise ~0.04% of the continuum), was
detected in the wing of a strong telluric line and displayed a P Cygni profile.
The spectral ranges around the frequencies of the S(5) and S(7) ortho-H2

sensitivities of 0.12% and 0.09% regarding the continuum emission,
respectively. We used a radiation transfer code to model these three lines and
derived a mass-loss rate of 2.43(0.21)E-05 M_sun/yr without using the CO

that the local evidence for the arrow of time, which is the entropy production

components: an independent term reflecting the dynamics of individual elements
and an interaction term driven by the dependencies among elements. Adapting
tools from non--equilibrium physics, we further decompose the interaction term
into contributions from pairs of elements, triplets, and higher--order terms.
We illustrate our methods on models of cellular sensing and logical

function of signal size and contrast. More generally, the observer study-based
characterization provides a mechanism to evaluate the sensitivity of the method
to specific object properties and may be explored as analogous to
characterizations such as modulation transfer function for linear systems.
Finally, this work underscores the need for objective task-based evaluation of
DL-based denoising approaches.

micro-architecture, which can, in turn, be used to reconstruct tissue
microstructure and white matter pathways. The accuracy of such tasks is
hampered by the low signal-to-noise ratio in dMRI. Today, the noise is
characterized mainly by visual inspection of residual maps and estimated
standard deviation. However, it is hard to estimate the impact of noise on
downstream tasks based only on such qualitative assessments. To address this
issue, we introduce a novel metric, Noise Uncertainty Quantification (NUQ), for
quantitative image quality analysis in the absence of a ground truth reference
image. NUQ uses a recent Bayesian formulation of dMRI models to estimate the
uncertainty of microstructural measures. Specifically, NUQ uses the maximum
mean discrepancy metric to compute a pooled quality score by comparing samples
drawn from the posterior distribution of the microstructure measures. We show
that NUQ allows a fine-grained analysis of noise, capturing details that are
visually imperceptible. We perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons on
real datasets, showing that NUQ generates consistent scores across different
denoisers and acquisitions. Lastly, by using NUQ on a cohort of schizophrenics

human mesh recovery has been drawing broader attention. With the same goal of
obtaining well-aligned and physically plausible mesh results, two paradigms
have been developed to overcome challenges in the 2D-to-3D lifting process: i)
an optimization-based paradigm, where different data terms and regularization
terms are exploited as optimization objectives; and ii) a regression-based
paradigm, where deep learning techniques are embraced to solve the problem in
an end-to-end fashion. Meanwhile, continuous efforts are devoted to improving
the quality of 3D mesh labels for a wide range of datasets. Though remarkable
progress has been achieved in the past decade, the task is still challenging

vulnerable to model inversion attacks, in which access to a model is abused to

rely on having access to either the complete target model (whitebox) or the
model's soft-labels (blackbox). However, no prior work has been done in the
harder but more practical scenario, in which the attacker only has access to
the model's predicted label, without a confidence measure. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm, Boundary-Repelling Model Inversion (BREP-MI), to invert
private training data using only the target model's predicted labels. The key
idea of our algorithm is to evaluate the model's predicted labels over a sphere
and then estimate the direction to reach the target class's centroid. Using the
example of face recognition, we show that the images reconstructed by BREP-MI
successfully reproduce the semantics of the private training data for various
datasets and target model architectures. We compare BREP-MI with the

reconstruction, 6D pose and size estimation from a single-view RGB-D

challenging problem where CAD models are not available at inference time.
Existing approaches mainly follow a complex multi-stage pipeline which first
localizes and detects each object instance in the image and then regresses to
either their 3D meshes or 6D poses. These approaches suffer from
high-computational cost and low performance in complex multi-object scenarios,
where occlusions can be present. Hence, we present a simple one-stage approach
to predict both the 3D shape and estimate the 6D pose and size jointly in a
bounding-box free manner. In particular, our method treats object instances as
spatial centers where each center denotes the complete shape of an object along
with its 6D pose and size. Through this per-pixel representation, our approach
can reconstruct in real-time (40 FPS) multiple novel object instances and
predict their 6D pose and sizes in a single-forward pass. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all
shape completion and categorical 6D pose and size estimation baselines on
multi-object ShapeNet and NOCS datasets respectively with a 12.6% absolute
improvement in mAP for 6D pose for novel real-world object instances.

phases of mass exchange and interaction. As these systems evolve into contact,
tidal dissipation is not always sufficient to bring them into circular,
synchronous orbits. In these cases, encounters of increasing strength occur
while the orbit remains eccentric. This paper focuses on the outcomes of close
tidal passages in eccentric orbits. Close eccentric passages excite dynamical
oscillations about the stars' equilibrium configurations. These tidal
oscillations arise from the transfer of orbital energy into oscillation mode
energy. When these oscillations reach sufficient amplitude, they break near the
stellar surface. The surface wave-breaking layer forms a shock-heated
atmosphere that surrounds the object. The continuing oscillations in the star's
interior launch shocks that dissipate into the this atmosphere, damping the
tidal oscillations. We show that the rapid, nonlinear dissipation associated
with the wave breaking of fundamental oscillation modes therefore comes with
coupled mass loss to the wave breaking atmosphere. The mass ratio is an
important characteristic that defines the relative importance of mass loss and
energy dissipation and therefore determines the fate of systems evolving under
the influence of nonlinear dissipation. The outcome can be rapid tidal
circularization ($q\ll1$) or runaway mass exchange ($q\gg1$).

on their proper motions, parallaxes and color-magnitude diagram. The latter

magnitude to eliminate contaminations due to either Milky Way stars or QSOs.
The precision of the data has been sufficient to reach extremely small

magnitudes deeper than the central surface brightness of Fornax. We discover a
break in the density profile, which reveals the presence of an additional

times the half-light radius of Fornax. The extended new component represents
10% of the stellar mass of Fornax, and behaves like an extended halo. The
absence of tidally elongated features at such an unprecedented depth

lack of gravity implying that residual stars have spherically expanded to form
the newly discovered stellar halo of Fornax.

the spin $S=1/2$ square lattice antiferromagnet, where recent numerical studies
have given evidence for such a phase existing in the regime of high frustration
between nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic
interactions (the $J_1$-$J_2$ model), appearing in a parameter regime between
the vanishing of N\'eel order and the onset of valence bond solid ordering. The
proximate Dirac spin liquid is unstable to monopole proliferation on the square
lattice, ultimately leading to N\'eel or valence bond solid ordering. As such,
we conjecture that this Higgs transition describes the critical theory
separating the gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid of the $J_1$-$J_2$ model from
one of the two proximate ordered phases. The transition into the other ordered
phase can be described in a unified manner via a transition into an unstable

deconfined critical theory separating the U(1) Dirac spin liquid from the

analyze the consequences of this anisotropic dispersion by calculating the
angular profiles of the equal-time N\'eel and valence bond solid correlation

potential to enable neuroimaging studies with sample sizes much larger than

the wild"" is challenging, since subjects are scanned with highly variable
protocols (MR contrast, resolution, orientation, etc.). Nevertheless, recent
advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and domain randomisation for
image segmentation, best represented by the publicly available method SynthSeg,
may enable morphometry of clinical MRI at scale. In this work, we first
evaluate SynthSeg on an uncurated, heterogeneous dataset of more than 10,000
scans acquired at Massachusetts General Hospital. We show that SynthSeg is
generally robust, but frequently falters on scans with low signal-to-noise
ratio or poor tissue contrast. Next, we propose SynthSeg+, a novel method that
greatly mitigates these problems using a hierarchy of conditional segmentation
and denoising CNNs. We show that this method is considerably more robust than
SynthSeg, while also outperforming cascaded networks and state-of-the-art
segmentation denoising methods. Finally, we apply our approach to a
proof-of-concept volumetric study of ageing, where it closely replicates
atrophy patterns observed in research studies conducted on high-quality, 1mm,
T1-weighted scans. The code and trained model are publicly available at

under small perturbations of a domain, while in the case of the Neumann or
mixed boundary conditions the spectrum may abruptly change. In this work we
discuss an example of such a domain perturbation. Let $\Omega$ be a (not
{necessarily} bounded) domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We perturb it to $
\Omega_\varepsilon=\Omega\setminus \cup_{k=1}^m S_{k,\varepsilon},$ where
$S_{k,\varepsilon}$ are closed surfaces with small suitably scaled holes
(``windows'') through which the bounded domains enclosed by these surfaces
(``resonators'') are connected to the outer domain. When $\varepsilon$ goes to
zero, the resonators shrink to points. We prove that in the limit
$\varepsilon\to 0$ the spectrum of the Laplacian on $\Omega_\varepsilon$ with
the Neumann boundary conditions on $S_{k,\varepsilon}$ and the Dirichlet
boundary conditions on the outer boundary converges to the union of the
spectrum of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $\Omega$ and the numbers $\gamma_k$,
$k=1,\dots,m$, being equal $1/4$ times the limit of the ratio between the

an estimate on the rate of this convergence with respect to the Hausdorff-type

  We study the performance and precision of various methods to determine the
minimum action and minimum-energy fission trajectories in the collective space.
  We apply the nudged elastic band method (NEB), grid-based methods, and Euler

  The performance of various approaches to the fission pathway problem is
assessed by studying the collective motion along both analytic energy surfaces

Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. The uniqueness and stability of the solutions
is studied. The NEB method is capable of efficient determination of the exit

be used to accurately compute the critical points (i.e., local minima and
saddle points) on the potential energy surface of the fissioning nucleus that
determine the static fission path.
  The NEB method is the tool of choice for finding the least-action and minimum

demonstrated great potential for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to low

difference in the sizes of available monolingual corpora between high
web-resource languages (HRL) and LRLs does not provide enough scope of
co-embedding the LRL with the HRL, thereby affecting downstream task
performance of LRLs. In this paper, we argue that relatedness among languages
in a language family along the dimension of lexical overlap may be leveraged to
overcome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs. We propose Overlap BPE
(OBPE), a simple yet effective modification to the BPE vocabulary generation
algorithm which enhances overlap across related languages. Through extensive
experiments on multiple NLP tasks and datasets, we observe that OBPE generates
a vocabulary that increases the representation of LRLs via tokens shared with
HRLs. This results in improved zero-shot transfer from related HRLs to LRLs
without reducing HRL representation and accuracy. Unlike previous studies that
dismissed the importance of token-overlap, we show that in the low-resource
related language setting, token overlap matters. Synthetically reducing the
overlap to zero can cause as much as a four-fold drop in zero-shot transfer
accuracy.

introduced for video compression, yet they operate uniformly over all spatial

de-emphasizing the distortion of the background. Secondly, we design an
explicit latent scaling method, that allows control over the quantization

has prompted the consideration of moir\'e heterostructures as polar materials.
However, misconceptions about the nature and origin of the observed
ferroelectricity indicate that a better theoretical understanding of the polar
properties of moir\'e heterostructures is needed. In this paper, it is
proposed, and verified with first-principles calculations, that all moir\'e
heterostructures exhibit an out-of-plane moir\'e polar domain (MPD) structure.
In transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers, an interlayer charge transfer
occurs due to the change in stacking arrangements throughout the moir\'e
superlattice, leading to a local out-of-plane dipole moment, with the magnitude
and shape of the MPDs being dominated by the chalcogen atoms. While the MPDs in
all heterostructures are sensitive to the moir\'e period, it is only in the
homo-bilayers that they can be tuned with an out-of-plane electric field. The
misconceptions about ferroelectricity in moir\'e heterostructures are
addressed, and it is proposed that the only scenario in which the MPDs can be
considered ferroelectric domains is via a global van der Waals sliding by one
third of a unit cell in a homo-bilayer. Finally, a general theoretical
discussion of the polar properties of moir\'e heterostructures is provided.

Here, we prove that such hybrid dynamics necessarily results in decoherence of

space. We further prove that a trade-off between the rate of this decoherence
and the degree of diffusion induced in the classical system is a general
feature of all classical quantum dynamics; long coherence times require strong
diffusion in phase-space relative to the strength of the coupling. Applying the
trade-off relation to gravity, we find a relationship between the strength of
gravitationally-induced decoherence versus diffusion of the metric and its
conjugate momenta. This provides an experimental signature of theories in which
gravity is fundamentally classical. Bounds on decoherence rates arising from
current interferometry experiments, combined with precision measurements of
mass, place significant restrictions on theories where Einstein's classical

another (e.g. target joint positions, or Cartesian end-effector poses) can
result in surprisingly stark performance differences between various downstream
tasks -- and as a result, considerable research has been devoted to finding the
right action space for a given application. However, in this work, we instead
investigate how our models can discover and learn for themselves which action
space to use. Leveraging recent work on implicit behavioral cloning, which
takes both observations and actions as input, we demonstrate that it is
possible to present the same action in multiple different spaces to the same
policy -- allowing it to learn inductive patterns from each space.
Specifically, we study the benefits of combining Cartesian and joint action
spaces in the context of learning manipulation skills. To this end, we present
Implicit Kinematic Policies (IKP), which incorporates the kinematic chain as a
differentiable module within the deep network. Quantitative experiments across
several simulated continuous control tasks -- from scooping piles of small
objects, to lifting boxes with elbows, to precise block insertion with
miscalibrated robots -- suggest IKP not only learns complex prehensile and
non-prehensile manipulation from pixels better than baseline alternatives, but
also can learn to compensate for small joint encoder offset errors. Finally, we
also run qualitative experiments on a real UR5e to demonstrate the feasibility

study, we propose an enhanced version of the physics-constrained deep neural
network (PCDNN) approach [1] to provide high-accuracy voltage predictions in

to enforce the physics-based zero-dimensional (0D) VRFB model in a neural
network to assure model generalization for various battery operation
conditions. Limited by the simplifications of the 0D model, the PCDNN cannot
capture sharp voltage changes in the extreme SOC regions. To improve the
accuracy of voltage prediction at extreme ranges, we introduce a second
(enhanced) DNN to mitigate the prediction errors carried from the 0D model
itself and call the resulting approach enhanced PCDNN (ePCDNN). By comparing
the model prediction with experimental data, we demonstrate that the ePCDNN
approach can accurately capture the voltage response throughout the
charge--discharge cycle, including the tail region of the voltage discharge
curve. Compared to the standard PCDNN, the prediction accuracy of the ePCDNN is
significantly improved. The loss function for training the ePCDNN is designed
to be flexible by adjusting the weights of the physics-constrained DNN and the

  disc masses and accretion rates: binaries explain high-accretors in Upper Sco","13 pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stac621",,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years a correlation between mass accretion rates onto new-born
stars and their proto-planetary disc masses was detected in nearby young
star-forming regions. Although such a correlation can be interpreted as due to
viscous-diffusion processes in the disc, highly-accreting sources with low disc
masses in more evolved regions remain puzzling. In this paper, we hypothesise
that the presence of a stellar companion truncating the disc can explain these
outliers. Firstly, we searched the literature for information on stellar
multiplicity in Lupus, Chamaeleon~I and Upper Sco, finding that roughly 20 per
cent of the discs involved in the correlation are in binaries or higher-order
multiple stellar systems. We prove with high statistical significance that at
any disc mass these sources have systematically higher accretion rates than
those in single-stars, with the bulk of the binary population being clustered
around $M_\mathrm{disc}/\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}\approx0.1\,\mathrm{Myr}$. We then
run coupled gas and dust one-dimensional evolutionary models of tidally
truncated discs to be compared with the data. We find that these models are
able to reproduce well most of the population of observed discs in Lupus and
Upper Sco, even though the unknown eccentricity of each binary prevents an
object by object comparison. In the latter region, the agreement improves if
the grain coagulation efficiency is reduced, as may be expected in discs around
close binaries. Finally, we mention that thermal winds and sub-structures can
be important in explaining few outlying sources.

unsolved. Even if only the final shape is of interest to the content creator,
the trap trajectories need to determine where and when the traps need to be,

structured numerical approach to compute trap trajectories for acoustic
levitation displays. Our approach generates trap trajectories that are
physically feasible and nearly time-optimal, and reveal generic mid-air shapes,
given only a reference path (i.e., a shape with no time information). We
provide a multi-dimensional model of the acoustic forces around a trap to model
the trap-particle system dynamics and compute optimal trap trajectories by
formulating and solving a non-linear path following problem. We formulate our
approach and evaluate it, demonstrating how OptiTrap consistently produces
feasible and nearly optimal paths, with increases in size, frequency, and
accuracy of the shapes rendered, allowing us to demonstrate larger and more
complex shapes than ever shown to date.

absorb solute molecules undergo spontaneous self-propulsion when their activity
is increased beyond a critical P\'{e}clet number ($Pe$). Here, we conduct
numerical computations, using a spectral-element based method, of a rigid,
spherical autophoretic particle in unsteady rectilinear translation. The
particle can be freely suspended (or `unforced') or subject to an external
force field (or `forced'). The motion of an unforced particle progresses
through four regimes as $Pe$ is increased: quiescent, steady, stirring, and
chaos. The particle is stationary in the quiescent regime, and the solute
profile is isotropic about the particle. At $Pe=4$ the fore-aft symmetry in the
solute profile is broken, resulting in its steady self-propulsion. Our
computations indicate that the self-propulsion speed scales linearly with
$Pe-4$ near the onset of self-propulsion, as has been predicted in previous
studies. A further increase in $Pe$ gives rise to the stirring regime at
$Pe\approx27$, where the fluid undergoes recirculation, while the particle
remains essentially stationary. As $Pe$ is increased even further, the particle
dynamics are marked by chaotic oscillations at $Pe\approx55$ and higher, which
we characterize in terms of the mean square displacement and velocity
autocorrelation of the particle. Our results for an autophoretic particle under
a weak external force are in good agreement with recent asymptotic predictions
(Saha, Yariv, and Schnitzer, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 916, A47, 2021).
Additionally, we demonstrate that the strength and temporal scheduling of the
external force may be tuned to modulate the chaotic dynamics at large $Pe$.

important biological insights. Currently, the large heterogeneous datasets
impose new challenges for statisticians because gene relationships are often
local. They change from one sample point to another, may only exist in a subset

dependence measures do not specifically target local dependence relationships,
and the ones that do are computationally costly. In this paper, we explore a
state-of-the-art network estimation technique that characterizes gene
relationships at the single-cell level, under the name of cell-specific gene

a population gives a novel univariate dependence measure that can detect any
non-linear, non-monotone relationship. Together with a consistent nonparametric
estimator, we establish its robustness on both the population and empirical
levels. Simulations and real data analysis show that this measure outperforms
existing independence measures like Pearson, Kendall's $\tau$, $\tau^\star$,
distance correlation, HSIC, Hoeffding's D, HHG, and MIC, on various tasks.

stage of the structural design offers an ideal framework for this task. When
the uncertainties are mainly affecting the objective function, robust design
optimization is traditionally considered. This work further assumes the
existence of multiple and competing objective functions that need to be dealt
with simultaneously. The optimization problem is formulated by considering
quantiles of the objective functions which allows for the combination of both
optimality and robustness in a single metric. By introducing the concept of
common random numbers, the resulting nested optimization problem may be solved
using a general-purpose solver, herein the non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm (NSGA-II). The computational cost of such an approach is however a
serious hurdle to its application in real-world problems. We therefore propose
a surrogate-assisted approach using Kriging as an inexpensive approximation of
the associated computational model. The proposed approach consists of
sequentially carrying out NSGA-II while using an adaptively built Kriging model
to estimate the quantiles. Finally, the methodology is adapted to account for
mixed categorical-continuous parameters as the applications involve the
selection of qualitative design parameters as well. The methodology is first
applied to two analytical examples showing its efficiency. The third
application relates to the selection of optimal renovation scenarios of a
building considering both its life cycle cost and environmental impact. It
shows that when it comes to renovation, the heating system replacement should
be the priority.

computational efficiency, and well-understood theoretical performance
guarantees. Recently, spectral clustering has been studied to find balanced
clusters under population-level constraints. These constraints are specified by
additional information available in the form of auxiliary categorical node
attributes. In this paper, we consider a scenario where these attributes may
not be observable, but manifest as latent features of an auxiliary graph.
Motivated by this, we study constrained spectral clustering with the aim of
finding balanced clusters in a given \textit{similarity graph} $\mathcal{G}$,
such that each individual is adequately represented with respect to an
auxiliary graph $\mathcal{R}$ (we refer to this as representation graph). We
propose an individual-level balancing constraint that formalizes this idea. Our
work leads to an interesting stochastic block model that not only plants the
given partitions in $\mathcal{G}$ but also plants the auxiliary information
encoded in the representation graph $\mathcal{R}$. We develop unnormalized and
normalized variants of spectral clustering in this setting. These algorithms
use $\mathcal{R}$ to find clusters in $\mathcal{G}$ that approximately satisfy
the proposed constraint. We also establish the first statistical consistency
result for constrained spectral clustering under individual-level constraints
for graphs sampled from the above-mentioned variant of the stochastic block
model. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.

of $\rm{kT_{e}}$, photon index ($\Gamma$), reflection fraction ($R$) and
optical depth ($\tau$) with flux, while, $\tau$ is found to anti-correlate with

However, if momentum transfers scale similarly in slope parallel and flow depth

extend existing single-phase Boussinesq-type models by developing a new
non-hydrostatic model for multi-phase mass flows consisting of solid and
fine-solid particles and viscous fluid (Pudasaini & Mergili, 2019). The new
model includes enhanced gravity and dispersion considering various interfacial
momentum transfers. We outline new contributions in the non-hydrostatic
Boussinesq-type multi-phase gravity waves emerging from phase-interactions. We
present a general, well-structured framework of multi-phase mass flows with
enhanced gravity and dispersion, setting a foundation for comprehensive
simulations. We discuss situations where non-hydrostatic, dispersive effects
are more pronounced for such flows. Reduced models demonstrate the importance
of non-hydrostatic contributions. Simplified analytical solutions reveal how
the new dispersive model can be reduced to non-dispersive ones, yet largely
generalizing existing models. We postulate a novel, spatially varying
dissipative force, called the prime-force, which physically controls the
dynamics and run-out of the mass flow in a precise way. Practitioners and
engineers may find this force very useful in technical applications. This
illuminates the need of formally including the prime-force in momentum
equations. A simple dispersion equation is derived highlighting the essence of
dispersion on mass flow dynamics. Dispersion produces a wavy velocity field
about a reference state without dispersion, the first of this kind for
avalanching debris mass. Dispersion intensity increases energetically as the
solid volume fraction or friction decreases.

is highly desirable, but is hindered by the lack or unreliability of an
available gold standard. To address this issue, techniques that can evaluate QI
methods without access to a gold standard are being actively developed. These
techniques assume that the true and measured values are linearly related by a
slope, bias, and Gaussian-distributed noise term, where the noise between
measurements made by different methods is independent of each other. However,
this noise arises in the process of measuring the same quantitative value, and
thus can be correlated. To address this limitation, we propose a
no-gold-standard evaluation (NGSE) technique that models this correlated noise
by a multi-variate Gaussian distribution parameterized by a covariance matrix.
We derive a maximum-likelihood-based approach to estimate the parameters that
describe the relationship between the true and measured values, without any
knowledge of the true values. We then use the estimated slopes and diagonal
elements of the covariance matrix to compute the noise-to-slope ratio (NSR) to
rank the QI methods on the basis of precision. The proposed NGSE technique was
evaluated with multiple numerical experiments. Our results showed that the
technique reliably estimated the NSR values and yielded accurate rankings of
the considered methods for ~ 83% of 160 trials. In particular, the technique
correctly identified the most precise method for ~ 97% of the trials. Overall,
this study demonstrates the efficacy of the NGSE technique to accurately rank
different QI methods when the correlated noise is present, and without access
to any knowledge of the ground truth. The results motivate further validation
of this technique with realistic simulation studies and patient data.

unique changes to the channel state information (CSI). Existing WiFi sensing
suffers from limited scalability as the system needs to be retrained whenever
new activities are added, which cause overheads of data collection and
retraining. Cross-domain sensing may fail because the mapping between
activities and CSI variations is destroyed when a different environment or user
(domain) is involved. This paper proposed a few-shot learning-based WiFi
sensing system, named FewSense, which can recognise novel classes in unseen
domains with only few samples. Specifically, a feature extractor was
pre-trained offline using the source domain data. When the system was applied
in the target domain, few samples were used to fine-tune the feature extractor
for domain adaptation. Inference was made by computing the cosine similarity.
FewSense can further boost the classification accuracy by collaboratively
fusing inference from multiple receivers. We evaluated the performance using
three public datasets, i.e., SignFi, Widar, and Wiar. The results show that
FewSense with five-shot learning recognised novel classes in unseen domains
with an accuracy of 90.3\%, 96.5\% ,82.7\% on SignFi, Widar, and Wiar datasets,

sequence of tasks without catastrophic forgetting. While there is a rich set of
techniques for CL, relatively little understanding exists on how
representations built by previous tasks benefit new tasks that are added to the
network. To address this, we study the problem of continual representation
learning (CRL) where we learn an evolving representation as new tasks arrive.
Focusing on zero-forgetting methods where tasks are embedded in subnetworks
(e.g., PackNet), we first provide experiments demonstrating CRL can
significantly boost sample efficiency when learning new tasks. To explain this,
we establish theoretical guarantees for CRL by providing sample complexity and
generalization error bounds for new tasks by formalizing the statistical
benefits of previously-learned representations. Our analysis and experiments
also highlight the importance of the order in which we learn the tasks.
Specifically, we show that CL benefits if the initial tasks have large sample
size and high ""representation diversity"". Diversity ensures that adding new
tasks incurs small representation mismatch and can be learned with few samples
while training only few additional nonzero weights. Finally, we ask whether one
can ensure each task subnetwork to be efficient during inference time while
retaining the benefits of representation learning. To this end, we propose an
inference-efficient variation of PackNet called Efficient Sparse PackNet (ESPN)
which employs joint channel & weight pruning. ESPN embeds tasks in
channel-sparse subnets requiring up to 80% less FLOPs to compute while
approximately retaining accuracy and is very competitive with a variety of
baselines. In summary, this work takes a step towards data and
compute-efficient CL with a representation learning perspective. GitHub page:

contributors 1) teach others to be involved in OSS projects, 2) show commitment
towards an OSS project, 3) have knowledge in specific programming languages,
and 4) are familiar with OSS practices. We then evaluate the tool by
administering a survey to 455 OSS contributors. We demonstrate that Disko
yields promising results: it detects the presence of these skills with
precision scores between 77% to 97%. We also find that over 54% of participants
would display their high-proficiency skills. Our approach can be used to
transform existing OSS experiences, such as identifying collaborators, matching

challenging problem (NP-hard, in fact) in condensed matter physics. However,
its applications spread far beyond physic due to its deep relation to various
combinatorial optimization problems, such as travelling salesman or protein
folding. Sophisticated and promising new methods for solving Ising instances
rely on quantum resources. In particular, quantum annealing is a quantum
computation paradigm, that is especially well suited for Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Nevertheless, commercially available
quantum annealers (i.e., D-Wave) are prone to various errors, and their ability
to find low energetic states (corresponding to solutions of superior quality)
is limited. This naturally calls for a post-processing procedure to correct
errors (capable of lowering the energy found by the annealer). As a
proof-of-concept, this work combines the recent ideas revolving around the
DIRAC architecture with the Chimera topology and applies them in a real-world

relationship between the damaged cerebellar regions and postoperative
neurological outcomes. Existing cerebellum normalization methods are not

normal brain tissues are first segmented using a Bayesian algorithm customized
for postoperative scans. Next, the cerebellum is isolated by nonlinear
registration of a whole brain template to the native space. The isolated
cerebellum is then normalized into the spatially unbiased atlas (SUIT) space
using anatomical information derived from the previous step. Finally, the
damage is detected in the atlas space by comparing the normalized cerebellum
and the SUIT template. We evaluated our damage detection tool on postoperative
scans of 153 patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma based on inspection by
human expects. We also designed a simulation to test the proposed approach

aimed to identify critical problems and suggest design requirements and

performed in an operating room by observing surgeons in their working
environment to understand how they performed tasks and achieved their intended
goals. Drawing on observations and analysis from recorded laparoscopic
surgeries, we have identified several constraints and design requirements to
propose potential solutions to address the issues. Surgeons operate in a dimly

allowed us to better understand the existing problems in laparoscopy while
identifying several communication constraints and design requirements, which a

identifying design requirements for laparoscopy surgery through a user and task

massive stars. Their evolution is heavily influenced by their internal mixing,
allowing the stars to live longer and yield a more massive helium core at the
end of their main-sequence evolution. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for
studying stellar interiors by providing direct probes of the interior physics
of the oscillating stars. This work revisits the recently derived internal
mixing profiles of 26 slowly pulsating B stars observed by the Kepler space
telescope, in order to investigate how well the mixing profiles can in fact be
distinguished from one another as well as provide predictions for the expected
helium core masses obtained at the end of the main-sequence evolution. We find
that for five of these stars the mixing profile is derived unambiguously, while
the remaining stars have at least one other mixing profile which explains the
oscillations equally well. Convective penetration is preferred over exponential
diffusive overshoot for ~55% of the stars, while stratified mixing is preferred
in the envelope (~39%). We estimate the expected helium core masses obtained at
the end of the main-sequence evolution and find them to be highly influenced by
the estimated amount of mixing occurring in the envelopes of the stars.

protoplanetary disks and primordial planetary atmospheres. We present a sample
of 6,003 stars with ages 7-25Myr in ten nearby open clusters from Chandra X-ray
and Gaia-EDR3 surveys. Combined with previous results in large samples of
younger (<5Myr) stars in MYStIX and SFiNCs star forming regions,
mass-stratified activity-age relations are derived for early phases of stellar
evolution. X-ray luminosity (Lx) is constant during the first few Myr, possibly
due to the presence of extended X-ray coronas insensitive to temporal changes
in stellar size. Lx then decays during the 7-25Myr period, more rapidly as
stellar mass increases. This decay is interpreted as decreasing efficiency of
the alpha^2 dynamo as radiative cores grow and a solar-type alpha-Omega dynamo
emerges. For more massive 3.5-7Mo fully radiative stars, the X-ray emission
plummets indicating lack of an effective magnetic dynamo. The findings provide
improved measurements of high energy radiation effects on circumstellar
material, first the protoplanetary disk and then the atmospheres of young
planets. The observed X-ray luminosities can be so high that an inner
Earth-mass rocky, unmagnetized planet around a solar-mass PMS star might lose
its primary and secondary atmospheres within a few-several million years. PMS
X-ray emission may thus have a significant impact on evolution of early
planetary atmospheres and the conditions promoting the rise of habitability.

self-supervision can achieve promising medical image segmentation results.
However, few-shot segmentation models typically rely on prototype
representations of the semantic classes, resulting in a loss of local
information that can degrade performance. This is particularly problematic for
the typically large and highly heterogeneous background class in medical image
segmentation problems. Previous works have attempted to address this issue by
learning additional prototypes for each class, but since the prototypes are
based on a limited number of slices, we argue that this ad-hoc solution is
insufficient to capture the background properties. Motivated by this, and the
observation that the foreground class (e.g., one organ) is relatively
homogeneous, we propose a novel anomaly detection-inspired approach to few-shot
medical image segmentation in which we refrain from modeling the background
explicitly. Instead, we rely solely on a single foreground prototype to compute
anomaly scores for all query pixels. The segmentation is then performed by
thresholding these anomaly scores using a learned threshold. Assisted by a
novel self-supervision task that exploits the 3D structure of medical images
through supervoxels, our proposed anomaly detection-inspired few-shot medical
image segmentation model outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on
two representative MRI datasets for the tasks of abdominal organ segmentation

extended to SA-CASSCF wave functions, in this work. Our implementation is
integral direct and based on intermediates that are formulated either in the
sparse atomic-orbital or small active molecular-orbital basis. Thus, it
benefits from a combination with efficient integral decomposition techniques,

that is predictive about the compressed data projected from the future
(output). The key insight of our framework is to learn representations by
minimizing the compression complexity and maximizing the predictive information
in latent space. We derive variational bounds of the CPIC loss which induces
the latent space to capture information that is maximally predictive. Our
variational bounds are tractable by leveraging bounds of mutual information. We
find that introducing stochasticity in the encoder robustly contributes to
better representation. Furthermore, variational approaches perform better in
mutual information estimation compared with estimates under a Gaussian

noisy dynamical systems with low signal-to-noise ratios, and extracts features

addressing these problems while maintaining the expressive power of deep neural

The derived physical parameters provide information to decipher the nature of
the dust cycle and of the stellar populations in these galaxies. The derived IR
composite template is consistent with the galaxies in the studied sample. A
delayed star formation history with tau_main = 500 Myrs is slightly favored by
the statistical analysis as compared to a delayed with a final burst or a
continuous star formation history. The position of the sample in the star
formation rate (SFR)- M_star diagram is consistent with previous papers. The
redshift evolution of the log M_star versus A_FUV relation is in agreement with
evolution in the redshift of this relation. This evolution is necessary to
explain the cosmic evolution of the average dust attenuation of galaxies.
Evolution is also observed in the L_dust/ L_FUV (IRX) versus UV slope beta_FUV

for a given Rayleigh number. Lower bounds on the maximal heat transport are
ascertained by computing the Nusselt number among equilibria of the chosen
model using numerical continuation. A method known as sum-of-squares
optimization is applied to construct upper bounds on the time-averaged Nusselt
number. In this case, the sum-of-squares approach involves constructing a
polynomial quantity whose global nonnegativity implies the upper bound along
all solutions to a chosen ROM. The minimum such bound is determined through a
type of convex optimization called semidefinite programming. For the ROMs
studied in this work, the Nusselt number is maximized by equilibria whenever
the Rayleigh number is sufficiently small. In this range of Rayleigh number,
the equilibria maximizing heat transport are those that bifurcate first from
the zero state. Analyzing this primary equilibrium branch provides a possible
mechanism for the increase in heat transport near the onset of convection.

the energetic costs of steric cell-cell repulsion and cell surface tension.
When perturbed, solid tissues exhibit yield-stress behavior, with a threshold
force for the onset of motion of a probe particle that vanishes upon
approaching the solid-to-liquid transition. This onset of motion is
qualitatively different in the low and high deformability regimes. At high
deformability, the tissue is amorphous when solid, it responds compliantly to

that the model response should not be significantly different between the

home, which has put significant burdens on the management of broadband networks
and called for intelligent service-by-service resource optimization at the
network edge. In this context, network traffic prediction is crucial for
operators to provide reliable connectivity across large geographic regions.
Although recent advances in neural network design have demonstrated potential
to effectively tackle forecasting, in this work we reveal based on real-world
measurements that network traffic across different regions differs widely. As a
result, models trained on historical traffic data observed in one region can
hardly serve in making accurate predictions in other areas. Training bespoke
models for different regions is tempting, but that approach bears significant
measurement overhead, is computationally expensive, and does not scale.
Therefore, in this paper we propose TransMUSE, a novel deep learning framework

feature similarity, and employs a Transformer-based Multi-service Traffic
Prediction Network (TMTPN), which can be directly transferred within a cohort

understanding relations within a massive entity set. The undirected network
representation task can be efficiently addressed by a symmetry non-negative
latent factor (SNLF) model, whose objective is clearly non-convex. However,
existing SNLF models commonly adopt a first-order optimizer that cannot well
handle the non-convex objective, thereby resulting in inaccurate representation
results. On the other hand, higher-order learning algorithms are expected to
make a breakthrough, but their computation efficiency are greatly limited due
to the direct manipulation of the Hessian matrix, which can be huge in
undirected network representation tasks. Aiming at addressing this issue, this
study proposes to incorporate an efficient second-order method into SNLF,
thereby establishing a second-order symmetric non-negative latent factor
analysis model for undirected network with two-fold ideas: a) incorporating a
mapping strategy into SNLF model to form an unconstrained model, and b)
training the unconstrained model with a specially designed second order method
to acquire a proper second-order step efficiently. Empirical studies indicate
that proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in representation
accuracy with affordable computational burden.

conventional source of electricity and as backup storage (pumped hydroelectric
storage) for providing energy in times of high demand on the grid. This study
examines the impact of hydropower on system electricity price and price
volatility in the region served by the New England Independent System Operator
(ISONE) from 2014 - 2020. We perform a robust holistic analysis of the mean and
quantile effects, as well as the marginal contributing effects of hydropower in
the presence of solar and wind resources. First, the price data is adjusted for
deterministic temporal trends, correcting for seasonal, weekend, and diurnal
effects that may obscure actual representative trends in the data. Using
multiple linear regression and quantile regression, we observe that hydropower
contributes to a reduction in the system electricity price and price
volatility. While hydropower has a weak impact on decreasing price and
volatility at the mean, it has greater impact at extreme quantiles (> 70th
percentile). At these higher percentiles, we find that hydropower provides a
stabilizing effect on price volatility in the presence of volatile resources
such as wind. We conclude with a discussion of the observed relationship
between hydropower and system electricity price and volatility.

modeling uncertainties of all the parameter estimates including the community
membership. Importantly, and unlike the majority of existing methods, our model
has the ability to learn the number of the communities via posterior inference
without having to assume it to be known. Our model can be applied to community

alongside task and environment specific objectives for any situation it
encounters. However, this approach is inefficient when modeling multiple
emotions and unable to generalize to new ones. In this work, we leverage the
fact that emotions are not independent of each other: they are related through
a latent space of Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD). Our key idea is to learn a
model for how trajectories map onto VAD with user labels. Considering the
distance between a trajectory's mapping and a target VAD allows this single
model to represent cost functions for all emotions. As a result 1) all user
feedback can contribute to learning about every emotion; 2) the robot can
generate trajectories for any emotion in the space instead of only a few
predefined ones; and 3) the robot can respond emotively to user-generated
natural language by mapping it to a target VAD. We introduce a method that
interactively learns to map trajectories to this latent space and test it in

a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder

dataset. Thus, we resort to learn from a union of multiple datasets, with each
dataset containing the images that are partially labeled. Secondly, along the
line of partial labelling, we contribute an open-source, large-scale vertebra
segmentation dataset for the benefit of spine analysis community, CTSpine1K,
boasting over 1,000 3D volumes and over 11K annotated vertebrae. Thirdly, in a
3D medical image segmentation task, due to the limitation of GPU memory, we
always train a model using cropped patches as inputs instead a whole 3D volume,
which limits the amount of contextual information to be learned. To this, we
propose a cross-patch transformer module to fuse more information in adjacent

segmentation performance. This is especially important for segmenting, say, the
elongated spine. Based on 7 partially labeled datasets that collectively
contain about 2,800 3D volumes, we successfully learn such a universal model.

  Review, Comparative Analysis, and Recommendations",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  High penetration of wind power with conventional grid following controls for
inverter-based wind turbine generators (WTGs) weakens the power grid,
challenging the power system stability. Grid-forming (GFM) controls are
emerging technologies that can address such stability issues. Numerous
methodologies of GFM inverters have been developed in the literature; however,
their applications for WTGs have not been thoroughly explored. As WTGs need to
incorporate multiple control functions to operate reliably in different
operational regions, the GFM control should be appropriately developed for the
WTGs. This paper presents a review of GFM controls for WTGs, which covers the
latest developments in GFM controls and includes multi-loop and single-loop
GFM, virtual synchronous machine-based GFM, and virtual inertia control-based
GFM. A comparison study for these GFM-based WTGs regarding normal and abnormal
operating conditions together with black-start capability is then performed.
The control parameters of these GFM types are properly designed and optimized
to enable a fair comparison. In addition, the challenges of applying these GFM
controls to wind turbines are discussed, which include the impact of DC-link
voltage control strategy and the current saturation algorithm on the GFM
control performance, black-start capability, and autonomous operation
capability. Finally, recommendations and future developments of GFM-based wind
turbines to increase the power system reliability are presented.

encouraging performance and shown the potential for annotation cost reduction.
However, due to the limited supervision signal of sparse annotations, it is
still challenging to employ them for networks training directly. In this work,
we propose a simple yet efficient scribble-supervised image segmentation method
and apply it to cardiac MRI segmentation. Specifically, we employ a dual-branch
network with one encoder and two slightly different decoders for image
segmentation and dynamically mix the two decoders' predictions to generate
pseudo labels for auxiliary supervision. By combining the scribble supervision
and auxiliary pseudo labels supervision, the dual-branch network can
efficiently learn from scribble annotations end-to-end. Experiments on the
public ACDC dataset show that our method performs better than current
scribble-supervised segmentation methods and also outperforms several
semi-supervised segmentation methods.

horizontal federated learning (HFL) is the best-studied category and handles

unutilized. In this paper, we propose a HFL method using neural networks named
continual horizontal federated learning (CHFL), a continual learning approach
to improve the performance of HFL by taking advantage of unique features of

by using common features through vanilla HFL and locally trains the second
column by using unique features and leveraging the knowledge of the first one
via lateral connections without interfering with the federated training of it.
We conduct experiments on various real world datasets and show that CHFL
greatly outperforms vanilla HFL that only uses common features and local

models can exhibit bias toward certain demographic attributes like race,
gender, and age. Existing bias mitigation methods primarily focus on learning
debiased models, which may not necessarily guarantee all sensitive information
can be removed and usually comes with considerable accuracy degradation on both
privileged and unprivileged groups. To tackle this issue, we propose a method,
FairPrune, that achieves fairness by pruning. Conventionally, pruning is used
to reduce the model size for efficient inference. However, we show that pruning
can also be a powerful tool to achieve fairness. Our observation is that during
pruning, each parameter in the model has different importance for different
groups' accuracy. By pruning the parameters based on this importance
difference, we can reduce the accuracy difference between the privileged group
and the unprivileged group to improve fairness without a large accuracy drop.
To this end, we use the second derivative of the parameters of a pre-trained
model to quantify the importance of each parameter with respect to the model
accuracy for each group. Experiments on two skin lesion diagnosis datasets over
multiple sensitive attributes demonstrate that our method can greatly improve
fairness while keeping the average accuracy of both groups as high as possible.

potential of relieving medical practitioners from routine jobs. In this paper,
we investigate the development of an optimization-based control framework for
an ultrasound-guided assistive robot to perform scoliosis assessment. A
conventional procedure for scoliosis assessment with ultrasound imaging
typically requires a medical practitioner to slide an ultrasound probe along a
patient's back. To automate this type of procedure, we need to consider
multiple objectives, such as contact force, position, orientation, energy,
posture, etc. To address the aforementioned components, we propose to formulate
the control framework design as a quadratic programming problem with each
objective weighed by its task priority subject to a set of equality and
inequality constraints. In addition, as the robot needs to establish constant
contact with the patient during spine scanning, we incorporate variable
impedance regulation of the end-effector position and orientation in the
control architecture to enhance safety and stability during the physical
human-robot interaction. Wherein, the variable impedance gains are retrieved by
learning from the medical expert's demonstrations. The proposed methodology is
evaluated by conducting real-world experiments of autonomous scoliosis
assessment with a robot manipulator xArm. The effectiveness is verified by the
obtained coronal spinal images of both a phantom and a human subject.

in data-driven settings where many systems face uncertainty. One such example
of concern is Bayesian Optimization (BO), where uncertainty is multi-faceted,

particular, there is the work of Kirschner et al. (2020), which bridges the
existing literature of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) by casting
the BO problem from the lens of DRO. While this work is pioneering, it
admittedly suffers from various practical shortcomings such as finite contexts

this question to a large degree of generality by considering robustness against
data-shift in $\phi$-divergences, which subsumes many popular choices, such as
the $\chi^2$-divergence, Total Variation, and the extant Kullback-Leibler (KL)

foreground semantic information is incorporated to ease the detection task by
highlighting the locations of each object class in the feature maps. Finally, a

further guides the detection backbone by suggesting possible box center
locations for objects. Our method works with any BEV-based 3D object detection

different stacking orders, many novel physical phenomena have been realized in
artificial vdW stacks. Recently, 2D ferroelectricity has been observed in
zero-degree aligned hBN and graphene-hBN heterostructures, holding promise in a
range of electronic applications. In those artificial stacks, however, the
single domain size is limited by the stacking-angle misalignment to about 0.1
to 1 $\mu$m, which is incompatible with most optical or optoelectronic
applications. Here we show MoS$_2$ in the rhombohedral phase can host a
homogeneous spontaneous polarization throughout few-$\mu$m-sized exfoliated
flakes, as it is a natural crystal requiring no stacking and is, therefore free
of misalignment. Utilizing this homogeneous polarization and its induced
depolarization field (DEP), we build a graphene-MoS$_2$ based photovoltaic
device with high efficiency. The few-layer MoS$_2$ is thinner than most
oxide-based ferroelectric films, which allows us to maximize the DEP and study
its impact at the atomically thin limit, while the highly uniform polarization
achievable in the commensurate crystal enables a tangible path for up-scaling.
The external quantum efficiency of our device is up to 16% at room temperature,
over one order larger than the highest efficiency observed in bulk photovoltaic
devices, owing to the reduced screening in graphene, the exciton-enhanced
light-matter interaction, and the ultrafast interlayer relaxation in MoS$_2$.
In view of the wide range of bandgap energy in other TMDs, our findings make
rhombohedral TMDs a promising and versatile candidate for applications such as
energy-efficient photo-detection with high speed and programmable polarity.

much larger topological lattice. Recent studies of non-Hermitian band theories
unveiled the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), by which the bulk states
collapse to the boundary as skin modes. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
that the NHSE can conversely affect wavefunctions of TMs by delocalizing them
from the boundary. At a critical non-Hermitian parameter, the in-gap TMs even
become completely extended in the entire bulk lattice, forming an extended mode
outside of a continuum. These extended modes are still protected by bulk-band
topology, making them robust against local disorders. The delocalization effect
is experimentally realized in active mechanical lattices in both
one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) topological lattices, as well as
in a higher-order topological lattice. Furthermore, by the judicious
engineering of the non-Hermiticity distribution, the TMs can deform into a

understanding of the TMs and the NHSE but also open new grounds for topological
applications.

domain learning (SDL) converges to the ideal solution, there is still a
significant visual difference between the reconstructed HSI and the truth.
Therefore, we propose a high-resolution dual-domain learning network (HDNet)
for HSI reconstruction. On the one hand, the proposed HR spatial-spectral
attention module with its efficient feature fusion provides continuous and fine
pixel-level features. On the other hand, frequency domain learning (FDL) is
introduced for HSI reconstruction to narrow the frequency domain discrepancy.
Dynamic FDL supervision forces the model to reconstruct fine-grained
frequencies and compensate for excessive smoothing and distortion caused by
pixel-level losses. The HR pixel-level attention and frequency-level refinement
in our HDNet mutually promote HSI perceptual quality. Extensive quantitative

have gotten gratifying results, those methods still fail to reconstruct intact
results in challenging scenes, such as weakly-textured surfaces, as those
methods primarily depend on pixel-wise photometric consistency which is
subjected to various illuminations. To alleviate matching ambiguity in those
challenging scenes, this paper proposes robust loss functions leveraging
constraints beneath multi-view images: 1) Patch-wise photometric consistency
loss, which expands the receptive field of the features in multi-view
similarity measuring, 2) Robust twoview geometric consistency, which includes a
cross-view depth consistency checking with the minimum occlusion. Our
unsupervised strategy can be implemented with arbitrary depth estimation
frameworks and can be trained with arbitrary large-scale MVS datasets.
Experiments show that our method can decrease the matching ambiguity and
particularly improve the completeness of weakly-textured reconstruction.

important characteristics required for reservoir computing, e.g., the
generalization ability, the nonlinearity, and the short-term memory. We
investigate these properties by imposing three standard tasks to test the

which merely some labels are known while others are unknown for each image, is
a considerably challenging and practical task. To address this task, current
algorithms mainly depend on pre-training classification or similarity models to
generate pseudo labels for the unknown labels. However, these algorithms depend
on sufficient multi-label annotations to train the models, leading to poor
performance especially with low known label proportion. In this work, we
propose to blend category-specific representation across different images to
transfer information of known labels to complement unknown labels, which can
get rid of pre-training models and thus does not depend on sufficient
annotations. To this end, we design a unified semantic-aware representation
blending (SARB) framework that exploits instance-level and prototype-level
semantic representation to complement unknown labels by two complementary
modules: 1) an instance-level representation blending (ILRB) module blends the
representations of the known labels in an image to the representations of the
unknown labels in another image to complement these unknown labels. 2) a
prototype-level representation blending (PLRB) module learns more stable
representation prototypes for each category and blends the representation of
unknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels to complement these
labels. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO, Visual Genome, Pascal VOC 2007
datasets show that the proposed SARB framework obtains superior performance
over current leading competitors on all known label proportion settings, i.e.,
with the mAP improvement of 4.6%, 4.%, 2.2% on these three datasets when the
known label proportion is 10%. Codes are available at

we speculate that the processes involved in the origin of the UV upturn are the
same. The observations are most consistent with spectral synthesis models
containing a fraction of a helium rich stellar population with abundances
between 37\% and 42\%, although we cannot formally exclude a contribution due
to residual star formation at the $\sim 0.5\%$ level (however, this appears
unlikely for cluster galaxies that are believed to be more quenched). This
suggests that the ultraviolet upturn is a primordial characteristic of early
type galaxies at all redshifts and that an unexpected nucleosynthesis channel

failure issues of underwater sensor networks by proposing an energy-efficient
hierarchical topology-aware clustering routing (EEHTAC) protocol. In this
paper, fault-tolerant backup clustering (FTBC) algorithms and multi-parameter
cluster formation (MPCF) model were developed for the EEHTAC operation. The
MPCF model tackles the issue of poor cluster formation performance by
integrating multiple parameters to achieve effective clustering process. The
FTBC algorithms tackle the issue of frequent CH failures to avoid interruption
in data transmission. Performance of the MPCF model was evaluated using normal,
high-fault, and high routing overhead network scenarios. Performance metrics
employed for this analysis are temporal topology variation ratio (TTVR), CH
load distribution (CLD), and cluster stability (STB). Obtained results show
that operating with a CH retention period of 90s achieves better CH duty
cycling per round and improves the MPCF process with values of 25.69%, 55.56%,
and 60% for TTVR, CLD, and STB respectively. Performance of the FTBC-based
EEHTAC was evaluated relative to Energy-balanced Unequal Layering Clustering
(EULC) protocol. Performance indicators adopted for this evaluation are routing
overhead ({\Omega}), end to end delay ({\Delta}), CH failures recovered (CFR),
CH failures detected (CFD), received packets ({\theta}), and energy consumption
({\Sigma}). With reference to the best obtained values, EEHTAC demonstrated
performance improvement of 58.40%, 29.94%, 81.33%, 28.02%, 86.65%, and 54.35%
over EULC variants in terms of {\Omega}, {\Delta}, CFR, CFD, {\theta}, and

efficient for cluster formation performance and the FTBC-based EEHTAC protocol
can perform effectively well against an existing CBR protocol.

molecules, is crucial for understanding the physical state of any astrophysical
system in thermodynamic equilibrium. There are surprisingly few {\em useful}
discussions of the partition function's numerical value. Textbooks often define
$U$; some give tables of representative values, while others do a deep dive
into the theory of a dense plasma. Most say that it depends on temperature,
atomic structure, density, and that it diverges, that is, it goes to infinity,
at high temperatures, but few give practical examples. We aim to rectify this.
We show that there are two limits, one and two-electron (or closed-shell)
systems like H or He, and species with a complicated electronic structure like
C, N, O, and Fe. The high-temperature divergence does not occur for one and
two-electron systems in practical situations since, at high temperatures,
species are collisionally ionized to higher ionization stages and are not
abundant. The partition function is then close to the statistical weight of the
ground state. There is no such simplification for many-electron species. $U$ is
temperature-sensitive across the range of temperatures where an ion is abundant
but remains finite at even the highest practical temperatures. The actual value
depends on highly uncertain truncation theories in high-density plasmas. We
show that there are various theories for continuum lowering but that they are
not in good agreement. This remains a long-standing unsolved problem.

is utilized in most existing models and several methods that incorporate other

propose a novel non-convex surrogate that can be optimized by closed-form
solutions, such that it empirically converges within dozens of iterations.
Besides, the optimization is parameter-free and the convergence is proved.
Compared with the relaxation of rank, the surrogate is motivated by optimizing
an upper-bound of rank. We theoretically validate that it is equivalent to the
existing matrix completion models. Besides the low-rank assumption, we intend
to exploit the column-wise correlation for matrix completion, and thus an
adaptive correlation learning, which is scaling-invariant, is developed. More
importantly, after incorporating the correlation learning, the model can be
still solved by closed-form solutions such that it still converges fast.
Experiments show the effectiveness of the non-convex surrogate and adaptive
correlation learning.

decisions. Among them, how to group these keywords to form several adgroups
within a campaign is a challenging task, due to the highly uncertain
environment of search advertising. This paper proposes a stochastic programming
model for keywords grouping, taking click-through rate and conversion rate as
random variables, with consideration of budget constraints and advertisers'
risk-tolerance. A branch-and-bound algorithm is developed to solve our model.
Furthermore, we conduct computational experiments to evaluate the effectiveness
of our model and solution, with two real-world datasets collected from reports
and logs of search advertising campaigns. Experimental results illustrated that
our keywords grouping approach outperforms five baselines, and it can
approximately approach the optimum in a steady way. This research generates
several interesting findings that illuminate critical managerial insights for
advertisers in sponsored search advertising. First, keywords grouping does
matter for advertisers, especially in the situation with a large number of
keywords. Second, in keyword grouping decisions, the marginal profit does not
necessarily show the marginal diminishing phenomenon as the budget increases.
Such that, it's a worthy try for advertisers to increase their budget in
keywords grouping decisions, in order to obtain additional profit. Third, the
optimal keywords grouping solution is a result of multifaceted trade-off among
various advertising factors. In particular, assigning more keywords into
adgroups or having more budget won't certainly lead to higher profits. This
suggests a warning for advertisers that it's not wise to take the number of
keywords as the criterion for keywords grouping decisions.

Self-supervised methods, on the other hand, aim at training deep networks
relying on pretext tasks or various consistency constraints. Moreover, other 3D
perception tasks (such as depth estimation) have shown the benefits of temporal
priors as a self-supervision signal. In this work, we argue that the temporal
consistency on the level of object poses, provides an important supervision
signal given the strong prior on physical motion. Specifically, we propose a
self-supervised loss which uses this consistency, in addition to
render-and-compare losses, to refine noisy pose predictions and derive
high-quality pseudo labels. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method,
we finetune a synthetically trained monocular 3D object detection model using

Existing detection approaches contribute to exploring the specific artifacts in

these artifacts keeps challenging the robustness of traditional deepfake
detectors. As a result, the development of generalizability of these approaches
has reached a blockage. To address this issue, given the empirical results that
the identities behind voices and faces are often mismatched in deepfake videos,
and the voices and faces have homogeneity to some extent, in this paper, we
propose to perform the deepfake detection from an unexplored voice-face
matching view. To this end, a voice-face matching method is devised to measure
the matching degree of these two. Nevertheless, training on specific deepfake
datasets makes the model overfit certain traits of deepfake algorithms. We
instead, advocate a method that quickly adapts to untapped forgery, with a
pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we first pre-train the
model on a generic audio-visual dataset, followed by the fine-tuning on
downstream deepfake data. We conduct extensive experiments over three widely
exploited deepfake datasets - DFDC, FakeAVCeleb, and DeepfakeTIMIT. Our method
obtains significant performance gains as compared to other state-of-the-art

conventional neural precoding design applies black-box-based neural networks

precoding method based on an interpretable design of a neural precoding
network, namely iPNet. In particular, the iPNet mimics the classic minimum
mean-squared error (MMSE) precoding and approximates the matrix inversion in
the design of the neural network architecture. Specifically, the proposed iPNet
consists of a model-driven component network, responsible for augmenting the
input channel state information (CSI), and a data-driven sub-network,
responsible for precoding calculation from this augmented CSI. The latter
data-driven module is explicitly interpreted as an unsupervised learner of the
MMSE precoder. Simulation results show that by exploiting the augmented CSI,
the proposed iPNet achieves noticeable performance gain over existing black-box
designs and also exhibits enhanced generalizability against CSI mismatches.

market outcomes, via a proposed simulation framework named EXP-SEA

studies of collective behaviors in the context of search engine advertising.
Design: We implement the EXP-SEA to validate the proposed simulation framework,
also conduct three experimental studies on the aggregate impact of electronic

supports heterogeneous participants, various auction mechanisms, and also
ranking and pricing algorithms. Findings: Findings from our three experiments
show that (a) both the market profit and advertising indexes such as number of
impressions and number of clicks are larger when the eWOM effect presents,
meaning social media certainly has some effect on search engine advertising
outcomes, (b) the competition level has a monotonic increasing effect on the
market performance, thus search engines have an incentive to encourage both the
eWOM among search users and competition among advertisers, and (c) given the
market-level effect of the percentage of advertisers employing a dynamic greedy
bidding strategy, there is a cut-off point for strategic bidding behaviors.
Originality: This is one of the first research works to explore collective
group decisions and resulting phenomena in the complex context of search engine
advertising via developing and validating a simulation framework that supports
assessments of various advertising strategies and estimations of the impact of
mechanisms on the search market.

  https://github.com/AndreaCeccarelli/metrics_model",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We argue that object detectors in the safety critical domain should
prioritize detection of objects that are most likely to interfere with the
actions of the autonomous actor. Especially, this applies to objects that can
impact the actor's safety and reliability. To quantify the impact of object
(mis)detection on safety and reliability in the context of autonomous driving,
we propose new object detection measures that reward the correct identification
of objects that are most dangerous and most likely to affect driving decisions.
To achieve this, we build an object criticality model to reward the detection
of the objects based on proximity, orientation, and relative velocity with
respect to the subject vehicle. Then, we apply our model on the recent
autonomous driving dataset nuScenes, and we compare nine object detectors.
Results show that, in several settings, object detectors that perform best
according to the nuScenes ranking are not the preferable ones when the focus is
shifted on safety and reliability.

a strong point for taking indecision itself to be a proper object of
consideration. This paper aims at revealing parallels between the findings

the field around the Spiderweb Galaxy at z=2.156, focusing on the nuclear
activity in the associated large-scale environment. We identify unresolved
X-ray sources down to flux limits of 1.3X10^{-16} and 3.9X10^{-16} erg/s/cm^2
in the soft and hard band, respectively. We search for counterparts in the
optical, NIR and submm bands to identify X-ray sources belonging to the
protocluster. We detect 107 X-ray unresolved sources within 5 arcmin
(corresponding to 2.5 Mpc) of J1140-2629, among which 13 have optical
counterparts with spectroscopic redshift 2.11<z<2.20, and 1 source with
photometric redshift consistent with this range. Our X-ray spectral analysis
shows that their intrinsic spectral slope is consistent with an average
<\Gamma>~1.84+-0.04. The best-fit intrinsic absorption for 5 protocluster X-ray
members is N_H>10^{23} cm^{-2}, while other 6 have upper limits of the order of
fewX10^{22} cm^{-2}. Two sources can only be fitted with very flat \Gamma<=1,
and are therefore considered Compton-thick candidates. Their 0.5-10 keV rest
frame luminosities are larger than 2X10^{43} erg/s, significantly greater than
X-ray luminosities expected from star formation activity. The X-ray luminosity
function of AGN in the volume associated to the Spiderweb protocluster in the
range 10^{43}<L_X<10^{44.5} erg/s, is at least 10 times higher than that in the
field at the same redshift and significantly flatter. The X-ray AGN fraction is
measured to be (25.5+-4.5)% in the stellar mass range log(M*/M_sun)>10.5,
corresponding to an enhancement of 6.0^{+9.0}_{-3.0} with respect to the COSMOS
field at comparable redshifts and stellar mass range. We conclude that the
galaxy population in the Spiderweb Protocluster is characterized by enhanced
X-ray nuclear activity triggered by environmental effects on Mpc scales.

applications requires optimizing the microstructure and crystalline defects
that influence electrical and thermal transport, and mechanical properties.
Laser surface remelting can be used to modify the sub-surface microstructure of
bulk materials and hence manipulate their properties locally. Here, we
introduce an approach to perform remelting in a reactive nitrogen atmosphere,
in order to form nitrides and induce segregation of nitrogen to structural
defects. These defects arise from the fast solidification of the full-Heusler
Fe2VAl compound that is a promising thermoelectric material. Advanced scanning
electron microscopy, including electron channelling contrast imaging and
three-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction, is complemented by atom
probe tomography to study the distribution of crystalline defects and their
local chemical composition. We reveal a high density of dislocations, which are
stable due to their character as geometrically necessary dislocations. At these
dislocations and low-angle grain boundaries, we observe segregation of nitrogen
and vanadium, which can be enhanced by repeated remelting in nitrogen
atmosphere. We propose that this approach can be generalized to other additive
manufacturing processes to promote local segregation and precipitation states,
thereby manipulating physical properties.

distributed optimization algorithm to solve consensus optimization over

devising the continuous-time counterpart of the recently proposed
(discrete-time) distributed gradient tracking called Continuous Gradient
Tracking. By using a Lyapunov approach, we prove exponential stability of the
equilibrium corresponding to agents' estimates being consensual to the optimal
solution of the problem, with arbitrary initialization of the local estimates.
Then, we propose two triggered versions of the algorithm. In the first one, the
agents continuously integrate their local dynamics and exchange with neighbors
current local variables according to a synchronous communication protocol. In
Asynchronous Triggered Gradient Tracking, we propose a totally asynchronous
scheme in which each agent sends to neighbors its current local variables based
on a triggering condition that depends on a locally verifiable condition. The
triggering protocol preserves the linear convergence of the algorithm and
excludes the Zeno behavior. By using the stability analysis of Continuous
Gradient Tracking as a preparatory result, we show exponential stability of the
equilibrium point holds for both triggered algorithms and any estimates'
initialization. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods showing also the improved performance in terms of

of a coupled degenerate Cahn-Hilliard Keller-Segel system for the mixture

informed by neuroimaging data, which give informations about the
patient-specific brain geometry and tissues microstructure, the distribution of
the different tumor components, the white matter fiber orientations and the
vasculature density. We describe specific and robust preprocessing steps to
extract quantitative informations from the neuroimaging data and to construct a
computational platform to solve the model on a patient-specific basis. We
introduce a finite element approximation of the model which preserve the

results for the patient-specific tumor evolution of a patient affected by
GlioBlastoma Multiforme, considering two different test cases before surgery,
corresponding to situations with high or low nutrient supply inside the tumor,

overall extension of the tumor distribution and the intensity of the
angiogenetic process, paving the way for assisting the clinicians in properly
assessing the therapy outcomes and in designing optimal patient-specific

embedded decoupled policy gradient and generative adversarial training, DePO
enables knowledge transfer to different action spaces or state transition

the alternatives as attractive or repulsive, pleasant or unpleasant. A decision
maker needs to make a choice taking into account both these features, the
utility of alternatives and their attractiveness. The notion of utility is
based on rational grounds, while the notion of attractiveness is vague and
rather is based on irrational feelings. A general method, allowing for the
quantification of the choice combining rational and emotional features is
described. Despite that emotions seem to avoid precise quantification, their
quantitative evaluation is possible at the aggregate level. The analysis of a

its versatility of (i) event-correlation types (e.g., causal, temporal,

battery-powered devices. In a capacitor, the energy harvester stores enough
energy to power up the embedded device and compute the task. This type of

unable to supply continuous power to embedded devices. All registers and cache

  NVM-based caches reduce system performance and consume more energy than
SRAM-based caches. This paper proposes Efficient Placement and Migration

migration policies to reduce the number of writes to STT-RAM. During a power

SRAM to STT-RAM. When compared to the baseline architecture, the proposed
architecture reduces STT-RAM writes from 63.35% to 35.93%, resulting in a

against outliers, we formulate the registration problem as a partial
distribution matching (PDM) problem, where the goal is to partially match the
distributions represented by point sets in a metric space. To handle large

partial Wasserstein-1 (PW) discrepancy. Specifically, we derive the
Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality for the PW discrepancy, and show its gradient

Wasserstein adversarial network (PWAN), which is able to approximate the PW
discrepancy by a neural network, and minimize it by gradient descent. In

control tasks by learning policies through interactions with the environment.
However, the training of DRL policies requires large amounts of training
experiences, making it impractical to learn the policy directly on physical
systems. Sim-to-real approaches leverage simulations to pretrain DRL policies
and then deploy them in the real world. Unfortunately, the direct real-world
deployment of pretrained policies usually suffers from performance
deterioration due to the different dynamics, known as the reality gap. Recent
sim-to-real methods, such as domain randomization and domain adaptation, focus
on improving the robustness of the pretrained agents. Nevertheless, the
simulation-trained policies often need to be tuned with real-world data to
reach optimal performance, which is challenging due to the high cost of
real-world samples.
  This work proposes a distributed cloud-edge architecture to train DRL agents
in the real world in real-time. In the architecture, the inference and training
are assigned to the edge and cloud, separating the real-time control loop from
the computationally expensive training loop. To overcome the reality gap, our
architecture exploits sim-to-real transfer strategies to continue the training

applicability on a physical inverted-pendulum control system, analyzing
critical parameters. The real-world experiments show that our architecture can
adapt the pretrained DRL agents to unseen dynamics consistently and

unsupervised methods can achieve comparable accuracy, but, more importantly,
much higher generalization capacity and efficiency than supervised methods.
Specifically, we present the Occlusion Pattern Aware Loss, named OPAL, which
successfully extracts and encodes the general occlusion patterns inherent in
the light field for loss calculation. OPAL enables: i) accurate and robust
estimation by effectively handling occlusions without using any ground-truth
information for training and ii) much efficient performance by significantly
reducing the network parameters required for accurate inference. Besides, a

even more accurate results. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method not

learning methods to generate synthetic images that look extremely realistic.
These techniques prove useful in the movie industry and for artistic purposes.
However, they also prove dangerous if used to spread fake news or to generate
fake online accounts. For this reason, detecting if an image is an actual
photograph or has been synthetically generated is becoming an urgent necessity.
This paper proposes a detector of synthetic images based on an ensemble of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We consider the problem of detecting
images generated with techniques not available at training time. This is a
common scenario, given that new image generators are published more and more
frequently. To solve this issue, we leverage two main ideas: (i) CNNs should
provide orthogonal results to better contribute to the ensemble; (ii) original
images are better defined than synthetic ones, thus they should be better
trusted at testing time. Experiments show that pursuing these two ideas
improves the detector accuracy on NVIDIA's newly generated StyleGAN3 images,
never used in training.

operating at multiple scales. At the cellular scale, cell-cell adhesion is
remarkably tunable to enable both cohesion and malleability during development,
homeostasis and disease. Such adaptable adhesion is physically supported by
transient bonds between laterally mobile molecules embedded in fluid membranes.
Thus, unlike specific adhesion at solid-solid or solid-fluid interfaces,
peeling at fluid-fluid interfaces can proceed by breaking bonds, by moving
bonds, or by a combination of both. How the additional degree of freedom
provided by bond mobility changes the mechanics of peeling is not understood.
To address this, we develop a theoretical model coupling self-consistently
diffusion, reactions and mechanics. Lateral mobility and reaction rates
determine distinct peeling regimes. In a diffusion-dominated Stefan-like
regime, bond motion establishes self-stabilizing dynamics that increase the
effective adhesion fracture energy. A reaction-dominated regime exhibits
traveling peeling solutions where small-scale diffusion and marginal unbinding
control peeling speed. In a mixed reaction-diffusion regime, strengthening by
bond motion competes with weakening by bond breaking in a force-dependent
manner, defining the strength of the adhesion patch. In turn, patch strength
depends on molecular properties such as bond stiffness, force sensitivity, or
crowding. We thus establish the physical rules enabling tunable cohesion in
cellular tissues and in engineered biomimetic systems.

then utilized to calibrate the quantization parameters. Extensive experiments

back down into an optimal binding site. This top-of-row mechanism becomes more

new oscillator strengths, and different atmospheric models, including the MARCS

the critical element for the interior models - calculations are carried out
using several independent methods. We find unprecedented agreement between the
new estimates of transition probabilities, thus supporting our revised solar
oxygen abundance. We also provide new estimates of the noble gas Ne abundance.
We investigate our results in comparison with the previous estimates. We
discuss the consistency of our photospheric measurements with meteoritic values
taking into account systematic and correlated errors. Finally, we provide
revised chemical abundances, leading to a new value of the solar photospheric
present-day metallicity $Z/X = 0.0225$, and employ them in the calculations of

parameters and by including all calcium lines viewed by the BCS instead of only
the resonance line, so greatly enhancing the photon count statistics. The
abundance variations are confirmed with the average abundance, $A({\rm Ca})$
(expressed logarithmically with $A({\rm H}) = 12$), equal to $6.77 \pm 0.20$
for 194 flares (141 of which are new in this study). This range corresponds to
factors of between 1.7 and 7.2 larger than the photospheric abundance and so
our results are in line with a ``FIP"" (first ionization potential) effect
whereby low-FIP elements like Ca (FIP = 6.11~eV) have enhanced coronal
abundances. The Ca flare abundance is uncorrelated with solar activity indices,
but weak correlations are suggested with GOES flare class and duration (larger
$A({\rm Ca})$ for smaller and shorter flares). The ponderomotive force theory
of Laming explaining the FIP effect gives a range of parameters within which
our estimates of $A({\rm Ca})$ agree with the theory. However, this then gives
rise to disagreements with previous estimates of the flare silicon and sulfur

Then, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimator and an SNR switched

$\omega_G$~(or at wavenumbers of $\sim \xi_s^{-1}$ and $\sim \xi_G^{-1}$). In
particular, both transverse and longitudinal phonons cross over between
Rayleigh scattering at $\omega < \omega_\ast$ and diffusive damping at
$\omega>\omega_\ast$. Remarkably, the Ioffe--Regel limit is located at the very
low frequency of $\omega_\ast$. Thus, phonon transport is localized above
$\omega_\ast$, even where phonon-like vibrational states persist. This markedly
strong scattering behavior is caused by the sparse, porous structure of the
gel.

transversely oscillating partial super-hydrophobic cylinder has been performed
using OpenFOAM libraries. Superhydrophobicity of the cylinder surface has been
addressed by means of a partial slip boundary condition. Applying the slip
condition to the surface of the stationary cylinder causes the drag and the rms
lift coefficients to reduce by 46 and 75 percent, respectively. It also
augments the average Nusselt number by 55 percent accompanied by a 21 percent
increase of the natural shedding frequency. The partially superhydrophobic
cylinder has also been investigated and the effects of slip on different
sections of the cylinder surface have been analyzed. Considering the reduction
of force coefficients, it is shown that the application of slip over a 135
segment of the surface is an optimum case, resulting in a 47 and 85 percent
decrease of the drag and the rms lift coefficients, respectively. However, the
fully superhydrophobic cylinder provides higher heat transfer rates. Regarding
the transversely oscillating cylinder, superhydrophobicity extends the primary
synchronization region, and also exhibits different wake dynamics behavior
compared to the no-slip case. The slip over surfaces also causes the average
Nusselt number to become nearly 6 times greater than the no-slip oscillating
cylinder at the lock-in condition. Further analysis based on thermal
performance index (TPI) proves that a high value of TPI = 6 can be reached for
the superhydrophobic cylinder.

variates through the approximate solution of the Poisson equation associated
with the target density of the Markov chain. The proposed method is based on
approximating the target density with a Gaussian and then utilising accurate
solutions of the Poisson equation for the Gaussian case. This leads to an
estimator that uses two key elements: (i) a control variate from the Poisson
equation that contains an intractable expectation under the proposal
distribution, (ii) a second control variate to reduce the variance of a Monte
Carlo estimate of this latter intractable expectation. Simulated data examples
are used to illustrate the impressive variance reduction achieved in the

transparency protocol that introduces postcertificates and utilizes the
existing Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. The protocol is practical, has a
low deployment cost, provides an immutable history of revocations, enables
delegation, and helps to detect revocation-related misbehavior by certificate
authorities (CAs). With this protocol, a holder of a postcertificate can bypass
the issuing CA and autonomously initiate the revocation process via submission
of the postcertificate to a CT log. The CAs are required to monitor CT logs and
proceed with the revocation upon detection of a postcertificate. Revocation
status delivery is performed independently and with an arbitrary status
protocol. Postcertificates can increase the accountability of the CAs and
empower the certificate owners by giving them additional control over the
status of the certificates. We evaluate the protocol, measure log and monitor

is desired to preserve the spatial and identity information of the source image

estimating a multiplicative mask to extract clean speech. However, most neural
network-based methods perform point estimation, i.e., their output consists of
a single mask. In this paper, we study the benefits of modeling uncertainty in
neural network-based speech enhancement. For this, our neural network is
trained to map a noisy spectrogram to the Wiener filter and its associated
variance, which quantifies uncertainty, based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
inference of spectral coefficients. By estimating the distribution instead of
the point estimate, one can model the uncertainty associated with each
estimate. We further propose to use the estimated Wiener filter and its
uncertainty to build an approximate MAP (A-MAP) estimator of spectral
magnitudes, which in turn is combined with the MAP inference of spectral
coefficients to form a hybrid loss function to jointly reinforce the
estimation. Experimental results on different datasets show that the proposed
method can not only capture the uncertainty associated with the estimated
filters, but also yield a higher enhancement performance over comparable models
that do not take uncertainty into account.

the order of $\min\{\hat{q},\nu\}$ under the diagonal stability and some
suitable regularity and accurate starting values, where $\hat{q}$ is the

followed by a gradual decrease in the H$\alpha$ line intensity on an M4-type
star, and the total energy radiated through H${\alpha}$ is estimated to be on
the order of $10^{33}$ erg. The H$\alpha$ line appears to have a Voigt profile
during the flare, which is likely caused by Stark pressure broadening due to
the dramatic increase of electron density and/or opacity broadening due to the
occurrence of strong non-thermal heating. Obvious enhancement has been
identified at the red wing of the H$\alpha$ line profile after the impulsive
increase of the H$\alpha$ line intensity. The red wing enhancement corresponds
to plasma moving away from the Earth at a velocity of 100$-$200 km s$^{-1}$.
According to the current knowledge of solar flares, this red wing enhancement
may originate from: (1) flare-driven coronal rain, (2) chromospheric
condensation, or (3) a filament/prominence eruption that either with a
non-radial backward propagation or with strong magnetic suppression. The total

such as neural networks, we propose to focus on tree-based LTR models, from
which we can extract the ground truth feature importance scores using decision
paths. Once extracted, we can directly compare the ground truth feature
importance scores to the feature importance scores generated with explanation
techniques. We compare two recently proposed explanation techniques for LTR
models when using decision trees and gradient boosting models on the MQ2008
dataset. We show that the explanation accuracy in these techniques can largely
vary depending on the explained model and even which data point is explained.

  Matching and Three-dimensional Contour Optimisation","submitted to Virtual Reality",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mixed reality applications often require virtual objects that are partly
occluded by real objects. However, previous research and commercial products
have limitations in terms of performance and efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel depth contour occlusion (DCO) algorithm. The
proposed method is based on the sensitivity of contour occlusion and a
binocular stereoscopic vision device. In this method, a depth contour map is
combined with a sparse depth map obtained from a two-stage adaptive filter area
stereo matching algorithm and the depth contour information of the objects
extracted by a digital image stabilisation optical flow method. We also propose
a quadratic optimisation model with three constraints to generate an accurate
dense map of the depth contour for high-quality real-virtual occlusion. The
whole process is accelerated by GPU. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
algorithm, we demonstrate a time con-sumption statistical analysis for each
stage of the DCO algorithm execution. To verify the relia-bility of the
real-virtual occlusion effect, we conduct an experimental analysis on
single-sided, enclosed, and complex occlusions; subsequently, we compare it
with the occlusion method without quadratic optimisation. With our GPU
implementation for real-time DCO, the evaluation indicates that applying the
presented DCO algorithm can enhance the real-time performance and the visual
quality of real-virtual occlusion.

multi-mirror system applied to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography using a
paraxial ray-tracing algorithm based on Seidel aberration theory is proposed.
By tracing the characteristic rays in the reflection system, the height and
paraxial angle on each surface can be obtained, then through the relationship
between the Seidel aberration coefficient and these parameters, the initial
structure with good aberration performance can be solved. We can obtain
different initial structures by adding different initial condition constraints.
In this paper, we have solved two different initial structures by assigning
different optical powers as different initial structures, and on this basis, we
have optimized two off-axis six-mirror systems with numerical aperture (NA) of
0.25. Their wavefront aberration RMS value is about 0.04 wavelength, and the
absolute distortion is less than 1.2nm, with good imaging quality. We believe
that this method can greatly improve the design efficiency and optimization
effect of complex multi-mirror systems.

{surface attachment} due to their durability and large adhesive force. To seal
on {a surfaces}, suction cups {must} be aligned with {the surface} and {possess
proper relative tangential velocity}. {However, quadrotors' attitude and
relative velocity errors would become significant when the object surface is
moving and inclined. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time
trajectory planning algorithm. The time-optimal aggressive trajectory is
efficiently generated through multimodal search in a dynamic time-domain. The
velocity errors relative to the moving surface are alleviated.} To further
adapt to the residual errors, we design a compliant gripper using self-sealing
cups. Multiple cups in different directions are integrated into a wheel-like
mechanism to increase the tolerance to attitude errors. The wheel mechanism
also eliminates the requirement of matching the attitude and tangential
velocity. {Extensive tests are conducted to perch on static and moving surfaces
at various inclinations.} Results demonstrate that our proposed system enables
a quadrotor to reliably perch on moving inclined surfaces (up to $1.07m/s$ and
$90^\circ$) with a success rate of $70\%$ or higher. {The efficacy of the
trajectory planner is also validated. Our gripper has larger adaptability to
attitude errors and tangential velocities than conventional suction cup
grippers.} The success rate increases by 45\% in dynamic perches.

anchored on a square cylinder and confined inside a channel. Many modern linear
analysis concepts have been developed and validated around non-reacting
bluff-body wake flows, and the objective of this paper is to explore whether
those tools can be applied with the same success to the study of reacting flows
in similar configurations. It is found that linear instability analysis of
steady reacting flow states accurately predicts critical flow parameters for
the onset of limit-cycle oscillations, when compared to direct numerical
simulation performed with a simple one-step reaction scheme in the low Mach
number limit. Furthermore, the linear analysis predicts a strong stabilising
effect of flame ignition, consistent with documented experiments and numerical
simulations. Instability in ignited wake flows is, however, found to set in at
sufficiently high Reynolds number, and a linear wavemaker analysis
characterises this instability as being driven by hydrodynamic mechanisms of a
similar nature as in non-reacting wake flows. The frequency of nonlinear
limit-cycle flame oscillations in this unstable regime is retrieved accurately
by linear eigenmode analysis performed on the time-averaged mean flow, under
the condition that the full set of the reacting flow equations is linearised.
If, on the contrary, unsteadiness in the density and in the reaction rate are
excluded from the linear model, then the congruence between linear and
nonlinear dynamics is lost.

pressing issues in contemporary particle physics. The dual-phase xenon
time-projection chamber is the leading technology to cover the available
parameter space for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), while
featuring extensive sensitivity to many alternative dark matter candidates.
These detectors can also study neutrinos through neutrinoless double-beta decay
and through a variety of astrophysical sources. A next-generation xenon-based
detector will therefore be a true multi-purpose observatory to significantly
advance particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, solar physics, and
cosmology. This review article presents the science cases for such a detector.

conditions, we construct Poisson structures on the gauge orbits of its set of
Maurer-Cartan (MC) elements, termed Maurer-Cartan-Poisson (MCP) structures.
They associate a compatible Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra to each MC element of L.
An MCP structure is shown to exist for a number of dglas associated to
commutative Frobenius algebras, deformations of Poisson and symplectic
structures, as well as the Chevally-Eilenberg complex. MCP structures yield a
notion of hamiltonian flow of MC elements, and also define Lie algebroids on
gauge orbits, whose isotropy algebras give invariants of MC elements. As an
example, this gives a finite-dimensional two-step nilpotent graded Lie algebra
associated to any closed symplectic manifold.

the bundle adjustment problem with a simulated quantum computer. Bundle
adjustment is the process of optimizing camera poses and sensor properties to
best reconstruct the three-dimensional structure and viewing parameters. This
problem is often solved using some implementation of the Levenberg--Marquardt
algorithm. In this case we implement a quantum algorithm for solving the linear
system of normal equations that calculates the optimization step in
Levenberg--Marquardt. This procedure is the current bottleneck in the
algorithmic complexity of bundle adjustment. The proposed quantum algorithm
dramatically reduces the complexity of this operation with respect to the
number of points.
  We investigate 9 configurations of a toy-model for bundle adjustment, limited
to 10 points and 2 cameras. This optimization problem is solved both by using
the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and our quantum implementation. The
resulting solutions are presented, showing an improved rate of convergence,
together with an analysis of the theoretical speed up and the probability of
running the algorithm successfully on a current quantum computer.
  The presented quantum algorithm is a seminal implementation of using quantum
computing algorithms in order to solve complex optimization problems in
computer vision, in particular bundle adjustment, which offers several avenues
of further investigations.

post-quantum ones? It is customary to argue that while this is problematic in
the interactive setting, non-interactive reductions do carry over. However,
when considering quantum auxiliary input, this conversion results in a
non-constructive post-quantum reduction that requires duplicating the quantum
auxiliary input, which is in general inefficient or even impossible. This
violates the win-win premise of provable cryptography: an attack against a
cryptographic primitive should lead to an algorithmic advantage.
  We initiate the study of constructive quantum reductions and present positive
and negative results for converting large classes of classical reductions to
the post-quantum setting in a constructive manner. We show that any
non-interactive non-adaptive reduction from assumptions with a polynomial
solution space (such as decision assumptions) can be made post-quantum
constructive. In contrast, assumptions with super-polynomial solution space
(such as general search assumptions) cannot be generally converted.
  Along the way, we make several additional contributions:
  1. We put forth a framework for reductions (or general interaction) with
stateful solvers for a computational problem, that may change their internal
state between consecutive calls. We show that such solvers can still be
utilized. This framework and our results are meaningful even in the classical
setting.
  2. A consequence of our negative result is that quantum auxiliary input that
is useful against a problem with a super-polynomial solution space cannot be
generically ``restored'' post-measurement. This shows that the novel rewinding
technique of Chiesa et al. (FOCS 2021) is tight in the sense that it cannot be
extended beyond a polynomial measurement space.

least $5$ times faster (< 440 Myr), the Earth surface was directly exposed to
the solar wind during coronal mass ejections. Nowadays, satellites at High,
Geosynchronous and Medium orbits are directly exposed to the solar wind during
coronal mass ejections, because part of the orbit at the Earth day side is

H\'enon and Lozi maps. Here, we focus on the orientation preserving Lozi
family, a two-parameter family of continuous piecewise affine maps, and treat
the family as a perturbation of the tent family from one to two dimensions.
  First, we give a new prove that all periodic orbits can be classified by
using symbolic dynamics. For each coding, the associated periodic orbit depends
on the parameters analytically on the domain of existence. The creation or
annihilation of periodic orbits happens when there is a border collision
bifurcation. Next, we prove that the bifurcation parameters of some types of
periodic orbits form analytic curves in the parameter space. This improves a
theorem of Ishii (1997). Finally, we use the model and the analytic curves to
prove that, when the Lozi family is arbitrary close to the tent family, the
order of periodic orbit creation reverses. This shows that a forcing relation
(Guckenheimer 1979 and Collett and Eckmann 1980) on orbit creations breaks down
in two dimensions. In fact, the forcing relation does not have a continuation

Learning (ML) techniques. Online learning approaches are specifically preferred
due to the fact that each radar node has no prior knowledge of the environment

of the problem. For this task we specifically select the multi-player
multi-armed bandit (MMAB) model, which poses the problem as a sequential game,
where each radar node in a network makes independent selections of center
frequency and waveform with the same goal of improving tracking performance for
the network as a whole. For accurate tracking, each radar node communicates
observations to a fusion center on set intervals. The fusion center has
knowledge of the radar node placement, but cannot communicate to the individual
nodes fast enough for waveform control. Every radar node in the network must
learn the behavior of the environment, which includes rewards, interferer
behavior, and target behavior. Our contributions include a mathematical
description of the MMAB framework adapted to the radar network scenario. We
conclude with a simulation study of several different network configurations.

0.6 mm. The anodes were interspersed with steering electrodes with varying
sizes from 0.3 mm to 0.85 mm. The maximum gap size between the anodes and
steering electrode strips was set to 0.3 mm, while the minimum gap size was
0.125 mm. The performance of the detector was investigated in terms of the
steering electrode bias voltage, the energy resolution, and the charge sharing
effect. For simulations, we developed a C++ based simulation program for charge
transport inside the CdZnTe detector and charge collection at the electrodes.
For photon interactions we used GEANT4 toolkit and for electric field and
weighting potential simulations we used COMSOL software. The results
demonstrated that -50 V is the optimal steering electrode bias for our detector
when -500 V was applied to the cathodes and that the energy resolution
performance drops with increasing steering electrode width. Also, the charge
sharing effect becomes more dominant for larger steering electrode sizes. The
experimental result are further compared with the simulations. The results are
in a good agreement and the comparison validates our simulation model.
Although, our simulation framework has need of better estimation for the
intrinsic noise of CdZnTe. These results suggest that an optimization study
between electrode widths and steering electrode bias is required to obtain the
best performance in orthogonal-strip CdZnTe detectors.

rise to an explosion in the quality and quantity of spectroscopic data
available for an unprecedented number of exoplanets in our galaxy. Accurately
extracting the information content, thereby permitting atmospheric science, of
such data-sets will require robust models and techniques. We present here the
analysis of simulated transmission spectra for water-rich atmospheres, giving
evidence for non-negligible differences in simulated transit depths when
self-broadening of H$_2$O is correctly accounted for, compared with the
currently typically accepted standard of using H$_2$ and He-broadened

pronounced for the lighter (i.e. $mu$ $\sim$ 4) atmospheres. Our work
illustrates that it is imperative that the field of exoplanet spectroscopy

Many of these approaches rely on the approach level and branch distance
heuristics to guide the search process and generate test cases with high line
and branch coverage. Despite the positive results achieved by these two
heuristics, they only use the information related to the coverage of explicit
branches (e.g., indicated by conditional and loop statements), but ignore
potential implicit branchings within basic blocks of code. If such implicit
branching happens at runtime (e.g., if an exception is thrown in a
branchless-method), the existing fitness functions cannot guide the search
process. To address this issue, we introduce a new secondary objective, called
Basic Block Coverage (BBC), which takes into account the coverage level of
relevant basic blocks in the control flow graph. We evaluated the impact of BBC
on search-based unit test generation (using the DynaMOSA algorithm) and
search-based crash reproduction (using the STDistance and WeightedSum fitness
functions). Our results show that for unit test generation, BBC improves the
branch coverage of the generated tests. Although small (around 1.5%), this
improvement in the branch coverage is systematic and leads to an increase of
the output domain coverage and implicit runtime exception coverage, and of the
diversity of runtime states. In terms of crash reproduction, in the combination
of STDistance and WeightedSum, BBC helps in reproducing 3 new crashes for each
fitness function. BBC significantly decreases the time required to reproduce
43.5% and 45.1% of the crashes using STDistance and WeightedSum, respectively.
For these crashes, BBC reduces the consumed time by 71.7% (for STDistance) and

First-principles calculations based on density functional theory were employed
to determine the formation energy of the main point defects in ZnO and Co:ZnO
systems. Based on the theoretical results a set of chemical reactions was
proposed. A detailed microstructural characterization was performed in order to
determine the degree of Co incorporation into the ZnO lattice. The samples
prepared in Ar atmosphere and from metallic Co presents the highest Co
solubility limit (lower apparent Co incorporation activation energy) due to the
incongruent ZnO decomposition. The determination of the parameters of the
sintering growth kinetics reveals that Co3O4 is the best sintering additive in
order to achieve higher densities in both sintering atmospheres. The results
give evidences that the sintering in O2 is effective in promoting zinc
vacancies in the ZnO structure, while the sintering in Ar promotes zinc
interstitial defects. Our findings give valuable contribution to the
understanding of the preparation of Co-doped ZnO ceramics and the sintering

frequency interference (RFI), the ionosphere, and instrumental effects. Even
after correcting for these effects in the calibration step and applying
foreground removal techniques, the remaining residuals in the observed 21 cm
power spectra are still above the thermal noise, which is referred to as the
""excess variance."" We study potential causes of this excess variance based on
13 nights of data obtained with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). We focused on
the impact of gain errors, the sky model, and ionospheric effects on the excess
variance by correlating the relevant parameters such as the gain variance over
time or frequency, local sidereal time (LST), diffractive scale, and phase
structure-function slope with the level of excess variance. Our analysis shows
that excess variance has an LST dependence, which is related to the power from
the sky. And the simulated Stokes I power spectra from bright sources and the
excess variance show a similar progression over LST with the minimum power
appearing at LST bin 6h to 9h. This LST dependence is also present in sky
images of the residual Stokes I of the observations. In very-wide sky images,
we demonstrate that the extra power comes exactly from the direction of bright
and distant sources Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A with the array beam patterns.
These results suggest that the level of excess variance in the 21 cm signal
power spectra is related to sky effects and, hence, it depends on LST. In
particular, very bright and distant sources such as Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A
can dominate the effect. This is in line with earlier studies and offers a path
forward toward a solution since the correlation between the sky-related effects
and the excess variance is non-negligible.

predictions are caught and corrected. We propose Quantile Binning, a

(NREM) sleep has shown to improve cognitive function when it is delivered at
the up-phase of SW. SW enhancement is particularly desirable in subjects with
low-amplitude SW such as older adults or patients suffering from
neurodegeneration such as Parkinson disease (PD). However, existing algorithms
to estimate the up-phase suffer from a poor phase accuracy at low EEG
amplitudes and when SW frequencies are not constant. We introduce two novel
algorithms for real-time EEG phase estimation on autonomous wearable devices.
The algorithms were based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) and, for the first time,
a phase vocoder (PV). We compared these phase tracking algorithms with a simple
amplitude threshold approach. The optimized algorithms were benchmarked for
phase accuracy, the capacity to estimate phase at SW amplitudes between 20 and
60 microV, and SW frequencies above 1 Hz on 324 recordings from healthy older
adults and PD patients. Furthermore, the algorithms were implemented on a
wearable device and the computational efficiency and the performance was
evaluated on simulated sleep EEG, as well as prospectively during a recording
with a PD patient. All three algorithms delivered more than 70% of the
stimulation triggers during the SW up-phase. The PV showed the highest capacity
on targeting low-amplitude SW and SW with frequencies above 1 Hz. The testing
on real-time hardware revealed that both PV and PLL have marginal impact on
microcontroller load, while the efficiency of the PV was 4% lower than the PLL.
Active auditory stimulation did not influence the phase tracking. This work
demonstrated that phase-accurate auditory stimulation can be delivered during
home-based sleep interventions with a wearable device also in populations with

first approximation. We use linearized ideal MHD to study quasimodes (global
modes that are damped through resonant absorption) with a frequency in the cusp
continuum, in a straight cylinder with a circular base and an inhomogeneous
layer at its boundary which separates two homogeneous plasma regions inside and
outside. We are in particular interested in the damping of these modes, and
shall hence try to determine their frequency as a function of background
parameters. After linearizing the ideal MHD equations, we find solutions to the
second-order differential equation for the perturbed total pressure in the
inhomogeneous layer in the form of Frobenius series around the regular singular
points that are the Alfv\'en and cusp resonant positions, as well as power
series around regular points. By connecting these solutions appropriately
through the inhomogeneous layer and with the solutions of the homogeneous
regions inside and outside the cylinder, we derive a dispersion relation for
the frequency of the eigenmodes of the system. From the dispersion relation, it
is also possible to find the frequency of quasimodes even though they are not
eigenmodes. As an example, we find the frequency of the slow surface sausage
quasimode as a function of the inhomogeneous layer's width, for values of the
longitudinal wavenumber relevant for photospheric conditions. The results were
found to match well the results found in another paper which studied the

being used in the cognitive sciences to perform null hypothesis tests, where a
null hypothesis that an effect is zero is compared with an alternative
hypothesis that the effect exists and is different from zero. While software
tools for Bayes factor null hypothesis tests are easily accessible, how to
specify the data and the model correctly is often not clear. In Bayesian
approaches, many authors use data aggregation at the by-subject level and
estimate Bayes factors on aggregated data. Here, we use simulation-based
calibration for model inference applied to several example experimental designs
to demonstrate that, as with frequentist analysis, such null hypothesis tests
on aggregated data can be problematic in Bayesian analysis. Specifically, when
random slope variances differ (i.e., violated sphericity assumption), Bayes
factors are too conservative for contrasts where the variance is small and they
are too liberal for contrasts where the variance is large. Running Bayesian
ANOVA on aggregated data can - if the sphericity assumption is violated -
likewise lead to biased Bayes factor results. Moreover, Bayes factors for
by-subject aggregated data are biased (too liberal) when random item slope
variance is present but ignored in the analysis. These problems can be
circumvented or reduced by running Bayesian linear mixed-effects models on
non-aggregated data such as on individual trials, and by explicitly modeling
the full random effects structure.

negative feedback loop introduced additionally to the feedback system. In
virtue of this, the robust consensus problem of the event-triggered network

relationships among the parameters of the controllers, the Laplacian matrix of

others, by the O-RAN Alliance-is bringing a radical transformation to the
cellular ecosystem through the notions of disaggregation and RAN Intelligent
Controllers (RICs). The latter enable closed-loop control through custom logic
applications, namely xApps and rApps, supporting control decisions at different
timescales. However, the current O-RAN specifications lack of a practical
approach to execute real-time control loops operating at timescales below 10ms.
In this paper, we propose the notion of dApps, distributed applications that
complement existing xApps/rApps by allowing operators to implement fine-grained
data-driven management and control in real-time at the Central Units
(CUs)/Distributed Units (DUs). dApps receive real-time data from the RAN, as
well as enrichment information from the near-real-time RIC, and execute
inference and control of lower-layer functionalities, thus enabling use cases
with stricter timing requirements than those considered by the RICs, such as
beam management and user scheduling. We propose feasible ways to integrate
dApps in the O-RAN architecture by leveraging and extending interfaces and
components already present therein. Finally, we discuss challenges specific to
dApps, and provide preliminary results that show the benefits of executing
network intelligence through dApps.

the UV and X-ray phase-resolved timing analysis of observations performed with
the Hubble Space Telescope, \textit{XMM-Newton} and NuSTAR satellites between
2014 and 2021. Ultraviolet pulsations are detected in the high luminosity mode
and disappear during low and flaring modes, similar to what is observed in the
X-ray band. In the high mode, we find variability in both the UV and X-ray
pulse amplitudes. The root mean square pulsed amplitude in the UV band ranges
from $\sim$2.1\% down to $\sim$0.7\%, while it oscillates in the interval
$5.5-12\%$ in the X-ray band. This variability is not correlated with the
orbital phase, like what has been observed in the optical band. Notwithstanding
the rather low statistics, we have marginal evidence that variations in the
pulse amplitude do not occur simultaneously in the UV and X-ray bands. When the
UV pulsed amplitude decreases below the detection threshold, no significant
variation in the X-ray pulsed amplitude is observed. These oscillations in the
pulse amplitude could be caused by small random variations in the mass
accretion rate leading to a variation in the size of the intra-binary shock
region. Finally, we find that the pulsed flux spectral distribution from the
X-ray to the UV band is well fitted using a power-law relation of the form $\nu
F_{\nu}^{pulsed} \sim \nu^{0.4}$. This supports the hypothesis of a common
physical mechanism underlying the X-ray, UV, and optical pulsed emissions in

in analyzing optical coherence tomography (OCT). Recently, many deep learning
based methods have been developed for this task and yield remarkable
performance. However, due to large spatial gap and potential mismatch between
the B-scans of OCT data, all of them are based on 2D segmentation of individual
B-scans, which may loss the continuity information across the B-scans. In
addition, 3D surface of the retina layers can provide more diagnostic
information, which is crucial in quantitative image analysis. In this study, a
novel framework based on hybrid 2D-3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is
proposed to obtain continuous 3D retinal layer surfaces from OCT. The 2D
features of individual B-scans are extracted by an encoder consisting of 2D
convolutions. These 2D features are then used to produce the alignment
displacement field and layer segmentation by two 3D decoders, which are coupled
via a spatial transformer module. The entire framework is trained end-to-end.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts 3D retinal
layer segmentation in volumetric OCT images based on CNNs. Experiments on a
publicly available dataset show that our framework achieves superior results to
state-of-the-art 2D methods in terms of both layer segmentation accuracy and
cross-B-scan 3D continuity, thus offering more clinical values than previous
works.

In the conventional FPM reconstruction framework, the sample image is divided
into multiple sub-regions for separately processing because the illumination

subregions contain different defocus distances due to the non-planar

between two particles that have interacted and then separated. Their
generalisation to quantum fields is necessary to study a number of
field-theoretic setups, such as cosmological density fluctuations. In this
work, we show how Bell operators can be constructed for quantum fields in real
space, and for Gaussian states we compute their expectation value in terms of
the field power spectra. We then apply our formalism to a scalar field in
de-Sitter space-time. We find that, in spite of the tremendous production of
entangled particles with opposite wave momenta on large scales, Bell
inequalities are not violated in real space. The reason is that, when
considering measurements of a field at two distinct locations in real space,
one implicitly traces over the configuration of the field at every other
location, leading to a mixed bipartite system. This ""effective decoherence""
effect is responsible for the erasure of quantum features, and casts some
doubts on our ability to reveal the quantum origin of cosmological structures.
We finally discuss these results in the light of quantum discord.

rapidly while causing high mortality during the pandemic period. Early
prediction of possible variants (especially spike protein) of COVID-19 epidemic
strains based on available mutated SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences may lead to early
prevention and treatment. Here, combining the advantage of quantum and
quantum-inspired algorithms with the wide application of deep learning, we
propose a development tool named DeepQuantum, and use this software to realize
the goal of predicting spike protein variation structure of COVID-19 epidemic
strains. In addition, this hybrid quantum-classical model for the first time
achieves quantum-inspired blur convolution similar to classical depthwise
convolution and also successfully applies quantum progressive training with
quantum circuits, both of which guarantee that our model is the quantum
counterpart of the famous style-based GAN. The results state that the
fidelities of random generating spike protein variation structure are always
beyond 96% for Delta, 94% for Omicron. The training loss curve is more stable
and converges better with multiple loss functions compared with the
corresponding classical algorithm. At last, evidences that quantum-inspired
algorithms promote the classical deep learning and hybrid models effectively
predict the mutant strains are strong.

information retrieval have so far been studied in data-oriented scenarios
regarding the effectiveness of retrieval results. Such studies have either
focused on the effects of artificially degraded OCR quality (see, e.g., [1-2])
or utilized test collections containing texts based on authentic low quality
OCR data (see, e.g., [3]). In this paper the effects of OCR quality are studied
in a user-oriented information retrieval setting. Thirty-two users evaluated
subjectively query results of six topics each (out of 30 topics) based on
pre-formulated queries using a simulated work task setting. To the best of our
knowledge our simulated work task experiment is the first one showing
empirically that users' subjective relevance assessments of retrieved documents
are affected by a change in the quality of optically read text. Users of
historical newspaper collections have so far commented effects of OCR'ed data
quality mainly in impressionistic ways, and controlled user environments for
studying effects of OCR quality on users' relevance assessments of the
retrieval results have so far been missing. To remedy this The National Library
of Finland (NLF) set up an experimental query environment for the contents of
one Finnish historical newspaper, Uusi Suometar 1869-1918, to be able to
compare users' evaluation of search results of two different OCR qualities for
digitized newspaper articles. The query interface was able to present the same
underlying document for the user based on two alternatives: either based on the
lower OCR quality, or based on the higher OCR quality, and the choice was
randomized. The users did not know about quality differences in the article
texts they evaluated. The main result of the study is that improved optical
character recognition quality affects perceived usefulness of historical
newspaper articles significantly. The mean average evaluation score for the
improved OCR results was 7.94% higher than the mean average evaluation score of
the old OCR results.

organizations to gain deeper insights into markets. Although deep learning has
been successfully implemented in this area, accuracy and processing time are
still major problems preventing it from reaching its full potential. This paper
proposes an Enhanced Leaky Rectified Linear Unit activation and Weighted Loss
(ELReLUWL) algorithm for enhanced text emotion classification and faster
parameter convergence speed. This algorithm includes the definition of the
inflection point and the slope for inputs on the left side of the inflection
point to avoid gradient saturation. It also considers the weight of samples
belonging to each class to compensate for the influence of data imbalance.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with the proposed algorithm to
increase the classification accuracy and decrease the processing time by
eliminating the gradient saturation problem and minimizing the negative effect
of data imbalance, demonstrated on a binary sentiment problem. The results show
that the proposed solution achieves better classification performance in
different data scenarios and different review types. The proposed model takes
less convergence time to achieve model optimization with seven epochs against
the current convergence time of 11.5 epochs on average. The proposed solution
improves accuracy and reduces the processing time of text emotion
classification. The solution provides an average class accuracy of 96.63%
against a current average accuracy of 91.56%. It also provides a processing
time of 23.3 milliseconds compared to the current average processing time of
33.2 milliseconds. Finally, this study solves the issues of gradient saturation
and data imbalance. It enhances overall average class accuracy and decreases
processing time.

supplementary to the existing literature of calender effect. Based on a
regression framework, this paper verifies the existence of solar term effect in
Shanghai Index in multiple dimensions: inter-solar-term analysis, full sample
analysis at mean level and risk level as well as the turn of solar term effect.
Several solar terms have been found to cause significant positive and negative
value to the return such as solar term 1,3 and 4. and bring high volatility
such as solar term 8, 11 and 14. The result is reliable and robust under the
Extreme Bound Analysis and various assumptions of errors distribution in IGARCH
model. These findings give readers a new perspective to view calender effect
under the influence of traditional Chinese culture that solar terms affect the
market through affecting investors mood, expectation, enthusiasm, etc. which is
a good evidence to the Culture bonus hypothesis proposed by Chen and Chien and
the possible influence by the Chinese culture in other Asian markets.

  Design",,,,,"cs.LO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous systems require the management of several model views to assure
properties such as safety and security among others. A crucial issue in
autonomous systems design assurance is the notion of emergent behavior; we
cannot use their parts in isolation to examine their overall behavior or
performance. Compositional verification attempts to combat emergence by
implementing model transformation as structure-preserving maps between model
views. AlgebraicDynamics relies on categorical semantics to draw relationships
between algebras and model views. We propose AlgebraicSystems, a conglomeration
of algebraic methods to assign semantics and categorical primitives to give
computational meaning to relationships between models so that the formalisms
and resulting tools are interoperable through vertical and horizontal
composition.

the one hand through Hilbert's views that concern formalism and intuition
applied for outer inquiry, and on the other hand through Brouwer's point of
view that concerns intuition applied for inner inquiry or, as I call,
self-inquiry. It is to demonstrate the essence of such investigations,
especially self-inquiry (inward intuition), I find it compelling to report that
a careful analysis of Cauchy's statements for the definition of derivative, as
applied in physics, unveils the connection to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle as a condition for the failure of classical mechanics. Such
logico-linguistic, or semantically driven, self-inquiry of physics can provide
new insights to physicists in the pursuit of truth and reality, for example, in
the context of Schroedinger equation. I point out an explicit dilemma that
plagues the semantics of physics, as far as general relativity and quantum
mechanics are concerned, which needs to be taken into account during any
attempt to pen down a theory of ""quantum gravity"".

  monoenergetic emission using Lie-point symmetries","18 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.106.L063201",,"physics.class-ph cond-mat.mes-hall physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding space-charge limited current density (SCLCD) is fundamentally
and practically important for characterizing many high-power and high-current
vacuum devices. Despite this, no analytic equations for SCLCD with nonzero
monoenergetic initial velocity have been derived for nonplanar diodes from
first principles. Obtaining analytic equations for SCLCD for nonplanar
geometries is often complicated by the nonlinearity of the problem and over
constrained boundary conditions. In this letter, we use the canonical
coordinates obtained by identifying Lie-point symmetries to linearize the
governing differential equations to derive SCLCD for any orthogonal diode.
Using this method, we derive exact analytic equations for SCLCD with a
monoenergetic injection velocity for one-dimensional cylindrical, spherical,
tip-to-tip (t-t), and tip-to-plate (t-p) diodes. We specifically demonstrate
that the correction factor from zero initial velocity to monoenergetic emission
depends only on the initial kinetic and electric potential energies and not on
the diode geometry and that SCLCD is universal when plotted as a function of
the canonical gap size. We also show that SCLCD for a t-p diode is a factor of
four larger than a t-t diode independent of injection velocity. The results
reduce to previously derived results for zero initial velocity using
variational calculus and conformal mapping.

and/or knowledge bases, such distantly annotated training data usually suffer
from a high false negative rate. To this end, we formulate the Distantly
Supervised NER (DS-NER) problem via Multi-class Positive and Unlabeled (MPU)
learning and propose a theoretically and practically novel CONFidence-based MPU
(Conf-MPU) approach. To handle the incomplete annotations, Conf-MPU consists of
two steps. First, a confidence score is estimated for each token of being an
entity token. Then, the proposed Conf-MPU risk estimation is applied to train a
multi-class classifier for the NER task. Thorough experiments on two benchmark
datasets labeled by various external knowledge demonstrate the superiority of
the proposed Conf-MPU over existing DS-NER methods.
