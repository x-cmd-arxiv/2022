(TMB) of a fast parton propagating in dense QCD matter in the leading
logarithmic approximation. These non-local corrections yield an anomalous
super-diffusive behavior characterized by a heavy tailed distribution which is
associated with L\'{e}vy random walks. Using a formal analogy with the physics
of traveling waves, we show that at late times the transverse momentum
distribution tends to a universal scaling regime. We derive analytic solutions
in terms of an asymptotic expansion around the scaling limit for both fixed and
running coupling. We note that our analytic approach yields a good agreement
with the exact numerical solutions down to realistic values of medium length.
Finally, we discuss the interplay between system size and energy dependence of
the diffusion coefficient $\hat q$ and its connection with the gluon

parameter estimation and sparsity recovery consistency of IHT has long been
known in compressed sensing. From the perspective of statistical learning,
another fundamental question is how well the IHT estimation would predict on
unseen data. This paper makes progress towards answering this open question by
introducing a novel sparse generalization theory for IHT under the notion of
algorithmic stability. Our theory reveals that: 1) under natural conditions on
the empirical risk function over $n$ samples of dimension $p$, IHT with
sparsity level $k$ enjoys an $\mathcal{\tilde
O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{k\log(n)\log(p)})$ rate of convergence in sparse excess risk;
2) a tighter $\mathcal{\tilde O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log(n)})$ bound can be
established by imposing an additional iteration stability condition on a
hypothetical IHT procedure invoked to the population risk; and 3) a fast rate
of order $\mathcal{\tilde O}\left(n^{-1}k(\log^3(n)+\log(p))\right)$ can be
derived for strongly convex risk function under proper strong-signal
conditions. The results have been substantialized to sparse linear regression

  Ranking","Accepted to CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The saliency ranking task is recently proposed to study the visual behavior
that humans would typically shift their attention over different objects of a
scene based on their degrees of saliency. Existing approaches focus on learning
either object-object or object-scene relations. Such a strategy follows the
idea of object-based attention in Psychology, but it tends to favor those
objects with strong semantics (e.g., humans), resulting in unrealistic saliency
ranking. We observe that spatial attention works concurrently with object-based
attention in the human visual recognition system. During the recognition
process, the human spatial attention mechanism would move, engage, and
disengage from region to region (i.e., context to context). This inspires us to
model the region-level interactions, in addition to the object-level reasoning,
for saliency ranking. To this end, we propose a novel bi-directional method to
unify spatial attention and object-based attention for saliency ranking. Our
model includes two novel modules: (1) a selective object saliency (SOS) module
that models objectbased attention via inferring the semantic representation of
the salient object, and (2) an object-context-object relation (OCOR) module
that allocates saliency ranks to objects by jointly modeling the object-context
and context-object interactions of the salient objects. Extensive experiments
show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-theart methods. Our code

retrieval. However, most prior arts failed to detect the semantic components
and their relationships behind the images, which makes them lack discriminative
power. To make up the defect, we propose a novel Deep Semantic Components
Hashing (DSCH), which involves a common sense that an image normally contains a
bunch of semantic components with homology and co-occurrence relationships.
Based on this prior, DSCH regards the semantic components as latent variables
under the Expectation-Maximization framework and designs a two-step iterative
algorithm with the objective of maximum likelihood of training data. Firstly,
DSCH constructs a semantic component structure by uncovering the fine-grained
semantics components of images with a Gaussian Mixture Modal~(GMM), where an
image is represented as a mixture of multiple components, and the semantics
co-occurrence are exploited. Besides, coarse-grained semantics components, are
discovered by considering the homology relationships between fine-grained
components, and the hierarchy organization is then constructed. Secondly, DSCH
makes the images close to their semantic component centers at both fine-grained
and coarse-grained levels, and also makes the images share similar semantic
components close to each other. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical semantic components indeed
facilitate the hashing model to achieve superior performance.

to resolve individual planetary absorption lines, despite the issues associated
with ground-based observations. The removal of contaminating stellar and
telluric absorption features is one of the most sensitive steps required to
reveal the planetary spectrum and, while many different detrending methods
exist, it remains difficult to directly compare the performance and efficacy of
these methods. Additionally, though the standard cross-correlation method
enables robust detection of specific atmospheric species, it only probes for
features that are expected a priori. Here we present a novel methodology using
Gaussian process (GP) regression to directly model the components of
high-resolution spectra, which partially addresses these issues. We use two
archival CRIRES/VLT data sets as test cases, observations of the hot Jupiters
HD 189733 b and 51 Pegasi b, recovering injected signals with average line
contrast ratios of $\sim 4.37 \times 10^{-3}$ and $\sim 1.39 \times 10^{-3}$,
and planet radial velocities $\Delta K_\mathrm{p} =1.45 \pm
1.53\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and $\Delta
K_\mathrm{p}=0.12\pm0.12\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ from the injection velocities
respectively. In addition, we demonstrate an application of the GP method to
assess the impact of the detrending process on the planetary spectrum, by
implementing injection-recovery tests. We show that standard detrending methods
used in the literature negatively affect the amplitudes of absorption features
in particular, which has the potential to render retrieval analyses inaccurate.
Finally, we discuss possible limiting factors for the non-detections using this
method, likely to be remedied by higher signal-to-noise data.

quantum information theory. In the smallest composite dimension, six, it is
known that between three and seven mutually unbiased bases exist, with a
decades-old conjecture, known as Zauner's conjecture, stating that there exist
at most three. Here we tackle Zauner's conjecture numerically through the
construction of Bell inequalities for every pair of integers $n,d \ge 2$ that
can be maximally violated in dimension $d$ if and only if $n$ MUBs exist in
that dimension. Hence we turn Zauner's conjecture into an optimisation problem,
which we address by means of three numerical methods: see-saw optimisation,
non-linear semidefinite programming and Monte Carlo techniques. All three
methods correctly identify the known cases in low dimensions and all suggest
that there do not exist four mutually unbiased bases in dimension six, with all
finding the same bases that numerically optimise the corresponding Bell
inequality. Moreover, these numerical optimisers appear to coincide with the
""four most distant bases"" in dimension six, found through numerically
optimising a distance measure in [P. Raynal, X. L\""u, B.-G. Englert, Phys. Rev.

three MUBs exist in dimension ten.

for domain adaption. Specifically, we first devise two siamese networks: a
teacher network in the synthetic domain and a student network in the real

and joint loss. Moreover, we design a sample-cycle strategy based on density
augmentation (HDA) module to introduce pseudo real-world image pairs provided
by the student network into training for further improving the generalization

to combine multiple ETA models into an ensemble. While an increase of
prediction precision is likely, the main drawback is that the predictions made
by such an ensemble become less transparent due to the sophisticated ensemble
architecture. One option to remedy this drawback is to apply eXplainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI). The contribution of this paper is three-fold.
First, we combine multiple machine learning models from our previous work for
ETA into a two-level ensemble model - a stacked ensemble model - which on its
own is novel; therefore, we can outperform previous state-of-the-art static
route-free ETA approaches. Second, we apply existing XAI methods to explain the

methods for combining the first-level explanations with the second-level ones.
Those joining methods enable us to explain stacked ensembles for regression
tasks. An experimental evaluation shows that the ETA models correctly learned
the importance of those input features driving the prediction.

runtimes of multiple hours (traditional) or intricate post-processing, such as
mesh extraction and topology correction (deep learning-based). In this work, we
address both of these issues and propose Vox2Cortex, a deep learning-based
algorithm that directly yields topologically correct, three-dimensional meshes
of the boundaries of the cortex. Vox2Cortex leverages convolutional and graph
convolutional neural networks to deform an initial template to the densely
folded geometry of the cortex represented by an input MRI scan. We show in
extensive experiments on three brain MRI datasets that our meshes are as
accurate as the ones reconstructed by state-of-the-art methods in the field,
without the need for time- and resource-intensive post-processing. To
accurately reconstruct the tightly folded cortex, we work with meshes
containing about 168,000 vertices at test time, scaling deep explicit
reconstruction methods to a new level.

major problem in the linear-response treatment of core-hole spectroscopies.
Rather than addressing relaxation through direct dynamical correlation of the

extend the alternative similarity-transformed equation-of-motion coupled
cluster theory (STEOMEE-CC) by including the core-valence separation (CVS) and
correlation of triple excitations only within the calculation of core
ionization energies. This new method, CVS-STEOMEE-CCSD+cT, significantly
improves on CVS-EOMEE-CCSD and unmodified CVS-STEOMEE-CCSD when compared to
full CVS-EOM-CCSDT for K-edge core-excitation energies of a set of small

positions is nearly as good as for transition-potential coupled cluster
(TP-CC), which includes an explicit treatment of orbital relaxation, and
CVS-EOMEE-CCSD*, which includes a perturbative treatment of triple excitations.

decision-making problems that are hard to overcome by any single agent in
isolation. However, continual coordination and communication learning between
machine agents or human-machine partnerships remains a challenging open
problem. As a stepping stone toward solving the continual communication
learning problem, in this paper we contribute a multi-faceted study into what
we term Pavlovian signalling -- a process by which learned, temporally extended
predictions made by one agent inform decision-making by another agent with
different perceptual access to their shared environment. We seek to establish
how different temporal processes and representational choices impact Pavlovian
signalling between learning agents. To do so, we introduce a partially
observable decision-making domain we call the Frost Hollow. In this domain a
prediction learning agent and a reinforcement learning agent are coupled into a
two-part decision-making system that seeks to acquire sparse reward while
avoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two domain variations: 1)
machine prediction and control learning in a linear walk, and 2) a prediction
learning machine interacting with a human participant in a virtual reality
environment. Our results showcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian
signalling, the impact that different temporal representations do (and do not)
have on agent-agent coordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent
and human-agent interactions differently. As a main contribution, we establish
Pavlovian signalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and
fully adaptive communication learning. Our results therefore point to an
actionable, constructivist path towards continual communication learning
between reinforcement learning agents, with potential impact in a range of
real-world settings.

rich phase diagram, including continuous and discontinuous transitions between
the active phase and extinction. In this work, we advance the understanding of
the phase transition of the 2SCP on uncorrelated networks by developing a
heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) theory, in which the heterogeneity of contacts
is explicitly reckoned. The HMF theory for networks with power-law degree
distributions shows that the region of bistability (active and inactive phases)
in the phase diagram shrinks as the heterogeneity level is increased by
reducing the degree exponent. Finite-size analysis reveals a complex behavior
where a pseudo discontinuous transition at a finite-size can be converted into
a continuous one in the thermodynamic limit, depending on degree exponent and
symbiotic coupling. The theoretical results are supported by extensive
numerical simulations.

  Special Issue for CALCO 2021 whose development start from arXiv:2108.13104",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Milner (1984) defined an operational semantics for regular expressions as
finite-state processes. In order to axiomatize bisimilarity of regular
expressions under this process semantics, he adapted Salomaa's proof system
that is complete for equality of regular expressions under the language
semantics. Apart from most equational axioms, Milner's system Mil inherits from
Salomaa's system a non-algebraic rule for solving single fixed-point equations.
Recognizing distinctive properties of the process semantics that render
Salomaa's proof strategy inapplicable, Milner posed completeness of the system
Mil as an open question.
  As a proof-theoretic approach to this problem we characterize the
derivational power that the fixed-point rule adds to the purely equational part
Mil$^-$ of Mil. We do so by means of a coinductive rule that permits cyclic
derivations that consist of a finite process graph with empty steps that
satisfies the layered loop existence and elimination property LLEE, and two of
its Mil$^{-}$-provable solutions. With this rule as replacement for the
fixed-point rule in Mil, we define the coinductive reformulation cMil as an
extension of Mil$^{-}$. In order to show that cMil and Mil are theorem
equivalent we develop effective proof transformations from Mil to cMil, and
vice versa. Since it is located half-way in between bisimulations and proofs in
Milner's system Mil, cMil may become a beachhead for a completeness proof of
Mil.
  This article extends our contribution to the CALCO 2022 proceedings. Here we
refine the proof transformations by framing them as eliminations of derivable
and admissible rules, and we link coinductive proofs to a coalgebraic
formulation of solutions of process graphs.

this way allows ToxiGen to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and
about more demographic groups, than previous resources of human-written text.
We conduct a human evaluation on a challenging subset of ToxiGen and find that
annotators struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written
language. We also find that 94.5% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech
by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that
finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data improves its performance on
human-written data substantially. We also demonstrate that ToxiGen can be used
to fight machine-generated toxicity as finetuning improves the classifier
significantly on our evaluation subset. Our code and data can be found at

label imbalance, domain shift, and divergent label distributions across

In this paper, we propose an autoregressive prior for 3D shapes to solve

We model the distribution over 3D shapes as a non-sequential autoregressive
distribution over a discretized, low-dimensional, symbolic grid-like latent
representation of 3D shapes. This enables us to represent distributions over 3D
shapes conditioned on information from an arbitrary set of spatially anchored
query locations and thus perform shape completion in such arbitrary settings
(e.g., generating a complete chair given only a view of the back leg). We also
show that the learned autoregressive prior can be leveraged for conditional
tasks such as single-view reconstruction and language-based generation. This is
achieved by learning task-specific naive conditionals which can be approximated
by light-weight models trained on minimal paired data. We validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method using both quantitative and qualitative

traditional CP decomposition -- that factorizes tensors into rank-one

(VM) decomposition that relaxes the low-rank constraints for two modes of a
tensor and factorizes tensors into compact vector and matrix factors. Beyond
superior rendering quality, our models with CP and VM decompositions lead to a
significantly lower memory footprint in comparison to previous and concurrent
works that directly optimize per-voxel features. Experimentally, we demonstrate
that TensoRF with CP decomposition achieves fast reconstruction (<30 min) with
better rendering quality and even a smaller model size (<4 MB) compared to
NeRF. Moreover, TensoRF with VM decomposition further boosts rendering quality

both galaxies displaying similar periods of enhanced star formation over the

interactions between the MCs have recurrently played an important role in their
evolution for at least the last $\sim$3.5 Gyr, tidally truncating the SMC and
shaping the LMC's spiral arm. We show, for the first time, an SMC-LMC

effective coarse-grained description of the dynamics of a many-body quantum

the simplified hydrodynamic description. Here we show that systems with the
same hydrodynamics can nevertheless belong to distinct dynamical universality
classes, as revealed by new classes of experimental observables accessible in
synthetic quantum systems, which can, for instance, measure simultaneous
site-resolved snapshots of all of the particles in a system. Specifically, we
study the full counting statistics of spin transport, whose first moment is
related to linear-response transport, but the higher moments go beyond. We
present an analytic theory of the full counting statistics of spin transport in
various integrable and non-integrable anisotropic one-dimensional spin models,
including the XXZ spin chain. We find that spin transport, while diffusive on
average, is governed by a distinct non-Gaussian dynamical universality class in
the models considered. We consider a setup in which the left and right half of
the chain are initially created at different magnetization densities, and
consider the probability distribution of the magnetization transferred between
the two half-chains. We derive a closed-form expression for the probability
distribution of the magnetization transfer, in terms of random walks on the
half-line. We show that this distribution strongly violates the large-deviation
form expected for diffusive chaotic systems, and explain the physical origin of
this violation. We discuss the crossovers that occur as the initial state is
brought closer to global equilibrium. Our predictions can directly be tested in

it was possible only thanks to X-ray observations. Out of eleven sources, five
show strong and hard X-ray fluxes, that allow their blazar classification, two
are uncertain, three host relativistic jets that we observe just outside their
beaming cone (i.e. are not strictly blazars), while one went undetected by
Swift/XRT. Following this approach, we were able to trace the $>10^9M_\odot$

nuclei. At $z\geq4$ the massive jetted sources are likely predominant in the
overall quasar population: this calls for a deep review of our understanding of
the first supermassive black holes formation and evolution. Jets are indeed key
actors in fast accretion, and must be searched for across the whole high
redshift quasar population. A note of caution must be added: radio-loudness and
in general radio features at high redshifts seem not to perfectly reflect
high-energy properties. A strong effect due to interaction with CMB radiation
is surely in place, that quenches the radio emission with respect to the
X-rays, but also more frequent occasions for the jet to be bent seem to play a
relevant role in this matter. Classifications and population studies thus must
be carefully performed, in order not to be confused by these inconsistencies.

measurement scheme involves the specification of a probe theory, an initial
probe state, a probe observable and a coupling between the system and the
probe, so that a measurement of the probe observable after the coupling has
ceased reproduces (in expectation) the result of measuring the system
observable in the system state. Recent work has shown how local and causal
measurement schemes may be described in the context of model-independent
quantum field theory (QFT), but has not addressed the question of whether such
measurement schemes exist for all system observables. Here, we present two
treatments of this question. The first is a proof of principle which provides a
measurement scheme for every local observable of the quantized real linear
scalar field if one relaxes one of the conditions on a QFT measurement scheme
by allowing a non-compact coupling region. Secondly, restricting to compact
coupling regions, we explicitly construct asymptotic measurement schemes for
every local observable of the quantized theory. More precisely, we show that
for every local system observable $A$ there is an associated collection of
measurement schemes for system observables that converge to $A$. All the
measurement schemes in this collection have the same fixed compact coupling
zone and the same processing region. The convergence of the system observables
holds, in particular, in GNS representations of suitable states on the field
algebra or the Weyl algebra. In this way, we show that every observable can be
asymptotically measured using locally coupled probe theories.

wealth of quantum many-body systems. Recent efforts have been directed towards
realizing quantum simulators of the model, by interfering two weakly coupled
one-dimensional cold atomic gases. The weak interactions within the atomic
clouds provide a sine-Gordon realization in the semiclassical regime.
Furthermore, the complex microscopic dynamics prevents a quantitative
understanding of the effective sine-Gordon validity realm. In this work, we
focus on a spin ladder realization and observe the emergent sine-Gordon
dynamics deep in the quantum regime. We use matrix-product state techniques to
numerically characterize the low-energy sector of the system and compare it
with the exact field theory predictions. From this comparison, we obtain
quantitative boundaries for the validity of the sine-Gordon description. We
provide encompassing evidence for the emergent field theory by probing its rich
spectrum and by observing the signatures of integrable dynamics in scattering

from the number of infectious social contacts defined by the square of the
population density at each location. The difference in the infection rate of
daily activities is considered, where the `stay-out' activity, staying at
someplace neither home nor workplace, is more than 28 times larger than other

manifolds can be generalized to involve functions of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded

theories for this phenomena, focusing on a minimal model of an insulator with a

an inverted band structure. We show that there are characteristic differences
between the QO frequencies in the magnetization and the low-energy density of

observables exhibit oscillations at the same frequency. The magnetization
oscillations are shown to arise from all occupied Landau levels and exhibit the
same frequency as the unhybridized case. The LE-DOS oscillations arise from
gap-edge states in a disorder-free system and exhibit a beat pattern between
two distinct frequencies at low temperature. Disorder induced in-gap states
lead to an additional contribution to the DOS at the unhybridized frequency.
The temperature dependence of the magnetization and DOS oscillations are
qualitatively different and both show marked deviations from the
Lifshitz-Kosevich form. We also compute transport to ensure that we are probing
a regime with insulating upturns in the dc resistivity.

absorption lines and Ly$\alpha$ emission. Outflow velocities are calculated
from the centroids of the LIS absorption and/or Ly$\alpha$ emission, as well as
the highest-velocity component of the outflow from the blue wings of the LIS
absorption lines. Outflow velocities are found to be marginally correlated or
independent of galaxy properties, such as star-formation rate (SFR) and
star-formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). Outflow velocity
scales with SFR as a power-law with index 0.24, which suggests that the
outflows may be primarily driven by mechanical energy generated by supernovae
explosions, as opposed to radiation pressure acting on dusty material. On the
other hand, outflow velocity and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ are not significantly
correlated, which may be due to the limited dynamic range of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$
probed by our sample. The relationship between outflow velocity and
$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ normalised by stellar mass ($\Sigma_{\rm sSFR}$), as a proxy
for gravitational potential, suggests that strong outflows (e.g., > 200 km
s$^{-1}$) appear ubiquitous above a threshold of log($\Sigma_{\rm
sSFR}/\rm{yr}^{-1}\ \rm{kpc}^{-2}$) ~ -11.3, and that above this threshold,
outflow velocity uncouples from $\Sigma_{\rm sSFR}$. These results highlight
the need for higher resolution spectroscopic data and spatially resolved
imaging to test the driving mechanisms of outflows predicted by theory.

LSST data, and provide a metric to evaluate how well SRNN can help recover the
underlying CARMA parameters. We find that the light curve reconstruction is
most sensitive to the duration of gaps between observing season, and that of
the proposed cadences, those that change the balance between filters, or avoid
having long gaps in the {g}-band perform better. Overall, SRNN is a promising
means to reconstruct densely sampled AGN light curves and recover the long-term
Structure Function of the DRW process (SF$_\infty$) reasonably well. However,
we find that for all cadences, CARMA/SRNN models struggle to recover the
decorrelation timescale ($\tau$) due to the long gaps in survey observations.

science.

regenerates the diffusion at some level with positive value every time the

biometric which can be used for security based purposes having unobtrusive
learning method. In comparison with other bio-metrics gait analysis has some
special security features. Most of the biometric technique uses sequential
template based component analysis for recognition. Comparing with those
methods, we proposed a developed technique for gait identification using the
feature Gait Energy Image (GEI). GEI representation of gait contains all
information of each image in one gait cycle and requires less storage and low
processing speed. As only one image is enough to store the necessary
information in GEI feature recognition process is very easier than any other
feature for gait recognition. Gait recognition has some limitations in
recognition process like viewing angle variation, walking speed, clothes,
carrying load etc. Our proposed method in the paper compares the recognition
performance with template based feature extraction which needs to process each

the frames in the cycle and results in better performance than other feature of

unseen categories with only a few annotated examples as supervision. The key to
few-shot segmentation is to establish a robust semantic relationship between
the support and query images and to prevent overfitting. In this paper, we
propose an effective Multi-similarity Hyperrelation Network (MSHNet) to tackle
the few-shot semantic segmentation problem. In MSHNet, we propose a new
Generative Prototype Similarity (GPS), which together with cosine similarity
can establish a strong semantic relation between the support and query images.
The locally generated prototype similarity based on global feature is logically
complementary to the global cosine similarity based on local feature, and the
relationship between the query image and the supported image can be expressed
more comprehensively by using the two similarities simultaneously. In addition,
we propose a Symmetric Merging Block (SMB) in MSHNet to efficiently merge
multi-layer, multi-shot and multi-similarity hyperrelational features. MSHNet
is built on the basis of similarity rather than specific category features,
which can achieve more general unity and effectively reduce overfitting. On two
benchmark semantic segmentation datasets Pascal-5i and COCO-20i, MSHNet
achieves new state-of-the-art performances on 1-shot and 5-shot semantic

This work shows that, for the considered type-II superionic conductors, the
diffusivity dramatically depends on the system size and that the superionic
regime is shifted to larger temperatures in smaller cells. Furthermore, only
simulations of several hundred atoms are able to capture the
experimentally-observed, characteristic change in the activation energy of the
diffusion process, occurring at the order-disorder transition to the superionic
regime. Finite-size effects on ion diffusion are instead much weaker in
{\alpha}-AgI. The thermal conductivity is found generally smaller for smaller

structures from galactic-scale filaments to tenth-of-a-parsec scale filaments,
comprising both molecular and atomic structures, from both observational and

large amount of catalogue data from different surveys and provide the most
comprehensive census of filamentary structures to date. Our census consists of
22 803 filamentary structures, facilitating a holistic perspective and new
insights. We use our census to conduct a meta-analysis, leading to a
description of filament properties over four orders of magnitudes in length and
eight in mass. Our analysis emphasises the hierarchical and dynamical nature of
filamentary structures. Filaments do not live in isolation, nor they generally
resemble static structures close to equilibrium. We propose that accretion
during filament formation and evolution sets some of the key scaling properties
of filaments. This highlights the role of accretion during filament formation
and evolution and also in setting the initial conditions for star formation.
Overall, the study of filamentary structures during the past decade has been
observationally driven. While great progress has been made on measuring the
basic properties of filaments, our understanding of their formation and

We find the effect of complex geometrical confinement resulting in the dramatic

power law with an exponent dependent on the porous host structure. After the
transient period, a crossover to a slower domain growth is observed when the
domain size becomes comparable to the pore size. Due to the geometric

not increase the peak force. Experimentally, folds are observed on substrates

Our simulations illustrate that the interfacial strength plays a dominating

promote users' attention and engagement. Most incentive mechanisms determine
specific incentive values based on users' attributes (e.g., preferences), while
such information is unavailable in many real-world applications. Meanwhile, due
to budget restrictions, realizing successful incentivization for all users can
be challenging to complete. In this light, we consider leveraging social
influence to maximize the incentivization result. We can directly incentivize
influential users to affect more users, so the cost of incentivizing these
users can be decreased. However, identifying influential users in a social
network requires complete information about influence strength among users,
which is impractical to acquire in real-world situations. In this research, we
propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based framework, called Geometric
Actor-Critic (GAC), to tackle the abovementioned problem. The proposed approach
can realize effective incentive allocation without having prior knowledge about
users' attributes. Three real-world social network datasets have been adopted
in the experiments to evaluate the performance of GAC. The experimental results
indicate that GAC can learn and apply effective incentive allocation policies

approaches.

transformers to spectrograms is suboptimal. Since the axes represent distinct
dimensions, i.e. frequency and time, we argue that a better approach is to
separate the attention dedicated to each axis. To this end, we propose the
Separable Transformer (SepTr), an architecture that employs two transformer
blocks in a sequential manner, the first attending to tokens within the same
time interval, and the second attending to tokens within the same frequency
bin. We conduct experiments on three benchmark data sets, showing that our

topic in linear programming due to its connection with the possibility of an
efficient pivot rule for the simplex method. We are interested in the diameters
of polyhedra formed from the so-called parallel or series connection of
oriented matroids: oriented matroids are the natural way to connect
representable matroid theory with the combinatorics of linear programming, and
these connections are fundamental operations for the construction of more
complicated matroids from elementary matroid blocks.
  We prove that, for polyhedra whose combinatorial diameter satisfies the
Hirsch-conjecture bound regardless of the right-hand sides in a standard-form
description, the diameters of their parallel or series connections remain small
in the Hirsch-conjecture bound. These results are a substantial step toward
devising a diameter bound for all polyhedra defined through totally-unimodular
matrices based on Seymour's famous decomposition theorem.
  Our proof techniques and results exhibit a number of interesting features.
While the parallel connection leads to a bound that adds just a constant, for
the series connection one has to linearly take into account the maximal value
in a specific coordinate of any vertex. Our proofs also require a careful
treatment of non-revisiting edge walks in degenerate polyhedra, as well as the
construction of edge walks that may take a `detour' to facets that satisfy the
non-revisiting conjecture when the underlying polyhedron may not.

photometric redshifts in these fields, finding only a 1\% rate of discrepancy
with other spectroscopic redshifts. We measure a small increase in median
photometric redshift error (from 1.0\% to 1.3\%) and catastrophic outlier rate
(from 3.5\% to 8\%) with decreasing stellar mass. We obtained successful
redshift fits for 75\% of massive galaxies, and demonstrate a similar 70-75\%
successful redshift measurement rate in $8.5 < \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) < 9.5$
galaxies, suggesting similar survey sensitivity in this low-mass range. We
describe the redshift, mass, and color-magnitude distributions of the catalog
galaxies, finding HALO7D galaxies representative of CANDELS galaxies up to
\textit{i}-band magnitudes of 25. The catalogs presented will enable studies of
star formation (SF), the mass-metallicity relation, SF-morphology relations,

intraoperative and simulation settings to evaluate technical skill execution.
However, VBA remains manually- and time-intensive and prone to subjective

learning (DL) model that can automatically and objectively provide a
high-stakes summative assessment of surgical skill execution based on video
feeds and low-stakes formative assessment to guide surgical skill acquisition.
Formative assessment is generated using heatmaps of visual features that
correlate with surgical performance. Hence, the DL model paves the way to the
quantitative and reproducible evaluation of surgical tasks from videos with the
potential for broad dissemination in surgical training, certification, and

the abundant textual information, there have been extensive research efforts in
enhancing knowledge embedding using texts. However, existing enhancement
approaches cannot apply to temporal knowledge graphs (tKGs), which contain
time-dependent event knowledge with complex temporal dynamics. Specifically,
existing enhancement approaches often assume knowledge embedding is
time-independent. In contrast, the entity embedding in tKG models usually
evolves, which poses the challenge of aligning temporally relevant texts with
entities. To this end, we propose to study enhancing temporal knowledge
embedding with textual data in this paper. As an approach to this task, we
propose Enhanced Temporal Knowledge Embeddings with Contextualized Language
Representations (ECOLA), which takes the temporal aspect into account and
injects textual information into temporal knowledge embedding. To evaluate
ECOLA, we introduce three new datasets for training and evaluating ECOLA.
Extensive experiments show that ECOLA significantly enhances temporal KG

transport coefficients appear that are forbidden in achiral metals, such as a
non-linear electric response known as electronic magneto-chiral anisotropy
(eMChA). While chiral transport signatures are by symmetry allowed in many
conductors without a center of inversion, it reaches appreciable levels only in
rare cases when an exceptionally strong chiral coupling to the itinerant
electrons is present. So far, observations of chiral transport have been
limited to materials in which the atomic positions strongly break mirror
symmetries. Here, we report chiral transport in the centro-symmetric layered
Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, observed via second harmonic generation under
in-plane magnetic field. The eMChA signal becomes significant only at
temperatures below $T'\sim$ 35 K, deep within the charge-ordered state of
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ ($T_{\mathrm{CDW}}\sim$ 94 K). This temperature dependence
reveals a direct correspondence between electronic chirality, unidirectional
charge order, and spontaneous time-reversal-symmetry breaking due to putative
orbital loop currents. We show that the chirality is set by the out-of-plane
field component and that a transition from left- to right-handed transport can
be induced by changing the field sign. CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is the first material in
which strong chiral transport can be controlled and switched by small
magnetic-field changes, in stark contrast to structurally chiral materials -- a
prerequisite for their applications in chiral electronics.

using motion alignment, such as optical flow, we propose a novel knowledge
distillation schema coined as Delta Distillation. In our proposal, the student
learns the variations in the teacher's intermediate features over time. We
demonstrate that these temporal variations can be effectively distilled due to
the temporal redundancies within video frames. During inference, both teacher

initial representations extracted only on the key-frame, and the latter by
iteratively estimating and applying deltas for the successive frames. Moreover,
we consider various design choices to learn optimal student architectures
including an end-to-end learnable architecture search. By extensive experiments

demonstrate that delta distillation sets a new state of the art in terms of

a system-under-test have the characteristics of a finite state machine (FSM).
Despite various strategies in the literature on this topic, little work exists
to handle special testing situations. More specifically, when concurrently: (1)
the test paths can start and end only in defined states of the FSM, (2) a
prioritization mechanism that requires only defined states and transitions of
the FSM to be visited by test cases is required, and (3) the test paths must be
in a given length range, not necessarily of explicit uniform length. This paper
presents a test generation strategy that satisfies all these requirements. A
concurrent combination of these requirements is highly practical for real
industrial testing. Six variants of possible algorithms to implement this
strategy are described. Using a mixture of 180 problem instances from real
automotive and defense projects and artificially generated FSMs, all variants
are compared with a baseline strategy based on an established N-switch coverage
concept modification. Various properties of the generated test paths and their
potential to activate fictional defects defined in FSMs are evaluated. The
presented strategy outperforms the baseline in most problem configurations. Out
of the six analyzed variants, three give the best results even though a
universal best performer is hard to identify. Depending on the application of
the FSM, the strategy and evaluation presented in this paper are applicable
both in testing functional and non-functional software requirements.

milkings are sampled and weighed. Statistical methods have been proposed to
estimate daily yields in dairy cows, centering on various yield correction
factors in two broad categories. The initial approach estimated a test-day
yield with doubled morning (AM) or evening (PM) yield in the AM-PM milking
plans, assuming equal AM and PM milking intervals. However, AM and PM milking
intervals can vary, and milk secretion rates may be different between day and
night. Additive correction factors (ACF) are evaluated by the average
differences between AM and PM milk yield for various milking interval classes
(MIC). We show that an ACF model is equivalent to a regression model of daily
yield on categorical regressor variables, and a continuous variable for AM or
PM yield with a fixed regression coefficient. Similarly, a linear regression
model can be implemented as an ACF model with the regression coefficient for AM
or PM yield estimated from the data. Multiplicative correction factors (MCF)
are ratio of daily yield to yield from single milkings, but their statistical
interpretations vary. Overall, MCF were more accurate for estimating daily milk
yield than ACF. MCF have biological and statistical challenges. An exponential
regression model was proposed as an alternative model for estimating daily milk
yield, which improved the accuracy in the present study. Characterization of
ACF and MCF showed how ACF and MCF improved the accuracy compared to doubling
AM or PM yield as the daily milk yield. The methods were explicitly described
to estimate daily milk yield in AM and PM milking plans. Still, the principles
are generally applicable to cows milked more than two times a day, and they
apply similarly to the estimation of daily fat and protein yields with some
necessary modifications.

measure of net feed efficiency in dairy cattle. RFI phenotypes are obtained as
residuals from linear regression encompassing relevant factors (i.e., energy
sinks) to account for body tissue mobilization. However, fitting energy sink
phenotypes as regression variables in standard linear regression was criticized
because phenotypes are subject to measurement errors. Multiple-trait models
have been proposed which derive RFI by follow-up partial regression. By
re-arranging the single-trait linear regression, we showed a causal RFI
interpretation underlying the linear regression for RFI. It postulates
recursive effects in energy allocation from energy sinks on dry matter intake,
but the feedback or simultaneous effects are assumed to be nonexistent. A
Bayesian recursive structural equation model was proposed for directly
predicting RFI and energy sinks and estimating relevant genetic parameters
simultaneously. A simplified Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that
implemented the Bayesian recursive model was described. The recursive model is
asymptotically equivalent to one-step linear regression for RFI, yet extends
the analytical capacity to multiple-trait analysis. It is equivalent to
Bayesian-implemented, multiple-trait model reparameterized based on Cholesky
decomposition of phenotypic (co)variance matrix for evaluating RFI, but varied
in assumptions about relationships between energy sinks.

spatial contiguity and aspatial attributes. Existing spatial clustering
approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns
with spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial
Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both
attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate
spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving
as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then
constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a
spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the
same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply
it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show
that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index
and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the
spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method
may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing,

functions, the parameter measurement precision is limited by several key
degeneracies within the cosmology and astrophysics sectors. For cosmic shear,
clustering amplitude $\sigma_8$ and matter density $\Omega_m$ roughly follow
the $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ relation. In turn, $S_8$ is highly
correlated with the intrinsic galaxy alignment amplitude $A_{\rm{IA}}$. For
galaxy clustering, the bias $b_g$ is degenerate with both $\sigma_8$ and
$\Omega_m$, as well as the stochasticity $r_g$. Moreover, the redshift
evolution of IA and bias can cause further parameter confusion. A tomographic
2-pt probe combination can partially lift these degeneracies. In this work we
demonstrate that a deep learning analysis of combined probes of weak
gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering, which we call DeepLSS, can
effectively break these degeneracies and yield significantly more precise
constraints on $\sigma_8$, $\Omega_m$, $A_{\rm{IA}}$, $b_g$, $r_g$, and IA
redshift evolution parameter $\eta_{\rm{IA}}$. The most significant gains are
in the IA sector: the precision of $A_{\rm{IA}}$ is increased by approximately
8x and is almost perfectly decorrelated from $S_8$. Galaxy bias $b_g$ is
improved by 1.5x, stochasticity $r_g$ by 3x, and the redshift evolution
$\eta_{\rm{IA}}$ and $\eta_b$ by 1.6x. Breaking these degeneracies leads to a
significant gain in constraining power for $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$, with the
figure of merit improved by 15x. We give an intuitive explanation for the
origin of this information gain using sensitivity maps. These results indicate
that the fully numerical, map-based forward modeling approach to cosmological
inference with machine learning may play an important role in upcoming LSS
surveys. We discuss perspectives and challenges in its practical deployment for
a full survey analysis.

Currently, $Y_\mathrm{P}$ is best determined by observations of metal-poor
galaxies, while there are only a few known local extremely metal-poor ($<0.1
Z_\odot$) galaxies (EMPGs) having reliable He/H measurements with
HeI$\lambda$10830 near-infrared (NIR) emission. Here we present deep Subaru NIR
spectroscopy for 10 EMPGs. Combining the existing optical data, He/H values of
5 out of the 10 EMPGs are reliably derived by the Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm. Adding the existing 3 EMPGs and 51 moderately metal-poor ($0.1-0.4
Z_\odot$) galaxies with reliable He/H estimates, we obtain
$Y_\mathrm{P}=0.2370^{+0.0034}_{-0.0033}$ by linear regression in the
$\mathrm{(He/H)}-\mathrm{(O/H)}$ plane, where we increase the number of EMPGs
from 3 to 8 anchoring He/H of the most metal-poor gas in galaxies. Although our
$Y_\mathrm{P}$ measurement and previous measurements are consistent, our result
is slightly ($\sim 1\sigma$) smaller due to our EMPGs. With our $Y_\mathrm{P}$
and the existing primordial deuterium $D_\mathrm{P}$ measurement, we constrain
the effective number of neutrino species $N_\mathrm{eff}$ and the
baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta$ showing $\gtrsim 1-2\sigma$ tensions with the
Standard Model and Planck Collaboration et al. (2020). Motivated by the
tensions, we allow the degeneracy parameter of electron-neutrino $\xi_e$ to
vary as well as $N_\mathrm{eff}$ and $\eta$. We obtain $\xi_e =
0.05^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $N_\mathrm{eff}=3.11^{+0.34}_{-0.31}$, and
$\eta\times10^{10}=6.08^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ from the $Y_\mathrm{P}$ and
$D_\mathrm{P}$ measurements with a prior of $\eta$ taken from Planck
Collaboration et al. (2020). Our constraints suggest a lepton asymmetry and
allow for a high value of $N_\mathrm{eff}$ within the $1\sigma$ level, which
could mitigate the Hubble tension.

several tidally perturbed modes. We find that there are peaks in the frequency
spectrum that are at or near the $3$rd, $12$th and $25$th orbital harmonics
($f_{orb} \sim 0.82$ d$^{-1}$). Also, there is a prominent overabundance of

characteristic of a tidally perturbed stellar pulsation, which is an outcome of
star-planet interactions in the misaligned system. There are peaks in both the

role in probing performance. We show that the extent of encoded linguistic
knowledge depends on the number of fine-tuning samples. The analysis also
reveals that larger training data mainly affects higher layers, and that the
extent of this change is a factor of the number of iterations updating the
model during fine-tuning rather than the diversity of the training samples.
Finally, we show through a set of experiments that fine-tuning data size
affects the recoverability of the changes made to the model's linguistic
knowledge.

objective is to compress the sensor observations in a way that maximizes the
accuracy of the inferred decision (i.e., sensing goal) at the FC. Unlike prior

variability metrics to assign morphological classifications to the remaining
aperiodic light curves. Another $\sim$39\% of the variable star sample beyond
the periodic sources are also flux-symmetric, but with a quasi-periodic

$\sim$29\% dippers (high positive $M$). We also investigate the relationship

gravitational forces between the two bodies and the central body become
competitive, temporary captures with multiple close encounters become possible
outcomes: a Jacobi capture. We perform 3-body simulations in order to
characterise the dynamics of Jacobi captures in the plane. We find that the
phase space structure resembles a Cantor-like set with a fractal dimension of
about 0.4. The lifetime distribution decreases exponentially, while the
distribution of the closest separation follows a power law with index 0.5. In
our first application, we consider the Jacobi capture of the Moon. We
demonstrate that both tidal captures and giant impacts are possible outcomes.
The impact speed is well approximated by a parabolic encounter, while the
impact angles follow that of a uniform beam on a circular target. Jacobi
captures at larger heliocentric distances are more likely to result in tidal
captures. In our second application, we find that Jacobi captures with
gravitational wave dissipation can result in the formation of binary black
holes in galactic nuclei. The eccentricity distribution is approximately
super-thermal and includes both prograde and retrograde orientations. We
conclude that dissipative Jacobi captures form an efficient channel for binary
formation, which motivates further research into establishing the universality

samples constitutes one of the main goals of quantum photonic sensing.
Furthermore, the nanoscale confinement of electromagnetic near fields in
photonic platforms through surface plasmon polaritons has motivated the
development of highly sensitive quantum plasmonic sensors. Despite the enormous
potential of plasmonic platforms for sensing, this class of sensors is
ultimately limited by the quantum statistical fluctuations of surface plasmons.
Indeed, the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field severely limit the
performance of quantum plasmonic sensing platforms in which delicate samples
are characterized using weak near-field signals. Furthermore, the inherent
losses associated with plasmonic fields levy additional constraints that
challenge the realization of sensitivities beyond the shot-noise limit. Here,
we introduce a protocol for quantum plasmonic sensing based on the conditional
detection of plasmons. We demonstrate that the conditional detection of
plasmonic fields, via plasmon subtraction, provides a new degree of freedom to
control quantum fluctuations of plasmonic fields. This mechanism enables
improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of photonic sensors relying on
plasmonic signals that are comparable to their associated field fluctuations.
Consequently, the possibility of using weak plasmonic signals to sense delicate
samples, while preserving the sample properties, has important implications for
molecule sensing, and chemical detection .

consensus mechanism to build a global ML model via peer-to-peer (P2P)-based
blockchain communications. Blockchain builds trust among MDs and ESs to
facilitate reliable ML model sharing and cooperative consensus formation, and
enables rapid elimination of manipulated models caused by poisoning attacks. We
formulate latency-aware BFL as an optimization aiming to minimize the system
latency via joint consideration of the data offloading decisions, MDs' transmit

computational allocation, and hash power allocation. Given the mixed action

the thermal noise. However, cryocooler vibration and structural resonances of

We performed vibration analysis of the cooling system at cryogenic temperature

vibration below 1 Hz is not impacted by cryocooler operation or structural
resonances and follows ground motion. The noise floor of the shield in 1-100 Hz
was observed to be 2-3 order of magnitude larger than seismic motion even
without cryocooler operation. The operation of cryocoolers does not change the
noise floor, but 2.0 Hz peaks and their harmonics were observed over the entire

cooling system vibration to the test mass. We conclude that vibration from the

speeds with respect to their surroundings. The fast motion and the stellar wind
of these stars, plus the wind-medium interaction, can lead to particle
acceleration and non-thermal radiation.
  Aims. We characterise the interaction between the winds of fast runaway stars
and their environment, in particular to establish their potential as cosmic-ray
accelerators and non-thermal emitters.
  Methods. We model the hydrodynamics of the interaction between the stellar
wind and the surrounding material. We self-consistently calculate the injection
and transport of relativistic particles in the bow shock using a multi-zone
code, and compute their broadband emission from radio to $\gamma$-rays.
  Results. Both the forward and reverse shocks are favourable sites for
particle acceleration, although the radiative efficiency of particles is low
and therefore the expected fluxes are in general rather faint.
  Conclusions. We show that high-sensitivity observations in the radio band can
be used to detect the non-thermal radiation associated with bow shocks from
hypervelocity and semi-relativistic stars. Hypervelocity stars are expected to
be modest sources of sub-TeV cosmic rays, accounting perhaps for a $\sim 0.1$%
of that of galactic cosmic rays.

contact-free method that requires only minimal optical access, 2C pyrometry
combined with high-speed acquisition is a promising diagnostic tool to obtain
exceptional temporal and spatial resolution of thermally degrading samples.
However, its conceptual simplicity relies on a set of basic assumptions that
when violated can result in large errors. In this work, we use an experimental
configuration representative for fire resistance testing for aerospace and
naval applications to analyze the impact of camera parameters and test setup on
the accuracy of the surface temperature results obtained. Two types of fibre

material specific aspects that effect the measurements. An improved workflow

post-fire hemispherical directional reflectance measurements at room

principles that govern nature at the fundamental level. Research in this field
usually relies on probing the boundaries of established physics, an undertaking
typically associated with extreme energy and distance scales. It is therefore
unsurprising that particle physics has traditionally been dominated by
large-scale experimental methods often involving high energies, such as
colliders and storage rings, cosmological and astrophysical observations,
large-volume detector systems, etc. However, high-sensitivity measurements in
smaller experiments, often performed at lower energies, are presently
experiencing a surge in importance for particle physics for at least two
reasons. First, they exploit synergies to adjacent areas of physics with recent
advances in experimental techniques and technology. Together with intensified
phenomenological explorations, these advances have led to the realization that
challenges associated with weak couplings or the expected suppression factors
for new physics can be overcome with such methods while maintaining a large
degree of experimental control. Second, many of these measurements broaden the
range of particle-physics phenomena and observables relative to the above set
of more conventional methodologies. Combining such measurements with the
conventional efforts above therefore casts both a wider and tighter net for
possible effects originating from physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This
paper argues that this assessment points at a growing impact of such methods

as particle-physics research. Leveraging the recent rapid progress and bright
outlook associated with such studies for high-energy physics, could yield high

is highly challenging and ill-posed. To address this problem, many approaches
fit smooth geometries through facial prior while learning details as additional
displacement maps or personalized basis. However, these techniques typically
require vast datasets of paired multi-view data or 3D scans, whereas such
datasets are scarce and expensive. To alleviate heavy data dependency, we
present a robust texture-guided geometric detail recovery approach using only a
single in-the-wild facial image. More specifically, our method combines
high-quality texture completion with the powerful expressiveness of implicit
surfaces. Initially, we inpaint occluded facial parts, generate complete
textures, and build an accurate multi-view dataset of the same subject. In
order to estimate the detailed geometry, we define an implicit signed distance
function and employ a physically-based implicit renderer to reconstruct fine
geometric details from the generated multi-view images. Our method not only
recovers accurate facial details but also decomposes normals, albedos, and
shading parts in a self-supervised way. Finally, we register the implicit shape
details to a 3D Morphable Model template, which can be used in traditional
modeling and rendering pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach can reconstruct impressive facial details from a single

dynamic space is essential for video recognition. On top of those stylized
spatio-temporal computational units, further refining the learnt feature with
axial contexts is demonstrated to be promising in achieving this goal. However,
previous works generally focus on utilizing a single kind of contexts to
calibrate entire feature channels and could hardly apply to deal with diverse
video activities. The problem can be tackled by using pair-wise spatio-temporal
attentions to recompute feature response with cross-axis contexts at the
expense of heavy computations. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature
refinement method that decomposes the feature channels into several groups and
separately refines them with different axial contexts in parallel. We refer
this lightweight feature calibration as group contextualization (GC).
Specifically, we design a family of efficient element-wise calibrators, i.e.,
ECal-G/S/T/L, where their axial contexts are information dynamics aggregated
from other axes either globally or locally, to contextualize feature channel
groups. The GC module can be densely plugged into each residual layer of the
off-the-shelf video networks. With little computational overhead, consistent
improvement is observed when plugging in GC on different networks. By utilizing
calibrators to embed feature with four different kinds of contexts in parallel,
the learnt representation is expected to be more resilient to diverse types of
activities. On videos with rich temporal variations, empirically GC can boost
the performance of 2D-CNN (e.g., TSN and TSM) to a level comparable to the
state-of-the-art video networks. Code is available at

proposals predicted from single view via fused features, or fuse the features
without considering the global spatial context; their performance is limited
consequently. In this paper, we propose to adaptively fuse multi-view features
in a global spatial context via Dual Cross-VIew SpaTial Attention (VISTA). The
proposed VISTA is a novel plug-and-play fusion module, wherein the multi-layer
perceptron widely adopted in standard attention modules is replaced with a
convolutional one. Thanks to the learned attention mechanism, VISTA can produce
fused features of high quality for prediction of proposals. We decouple the

attention variance is applied that enables the attention module to focus on
specific targets instead of generic points. We conduct thorough experiments on

graphene (tBLG) and other moire superlattices recently, including correlated
insulators, superconductivity, magnetism, and topological states. These
phenomena are very sensitive to the moire superlattices, which can hardly be
changed rapidly or intensely. Here, we report the experimental realization of a
high-order moire pattern (a high-order interference pattern) in
graphene-monolayer xenon heterostructure (G/mXe), with moire period in-situ
tuned from few nanometers to infinity by changing the lattice constant of Xe
through different annealing temperatures and pressures. We use angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to directly observe that replicas of graphene Dirac
cone emerge and move close to each other in momentum-space as moire pattern
continuously expands in real-space. When the moire period approaches infinity,
the replicas finally overlap with each other and an energy gap is observed at
the Dirac point induced by intervalley coupling, which is a manifestation of
Kekule distortion. We construct a continuum moire Hamiltonian, which can
explain the experimental results well. The form of moire Hamiltonian in G/mXe
is similar to that in tBLG, and moire band with narrow bandwidth is predicted
in G/mXe. However, the moire Hamiltonian couples Dirac fermions from different
valleys in G/mXe, instead of ones from different layers in tBLG. Our work
demonstrates a novel platform to study the continuous evolution of moire
pattern and its modulation effect on electronic structure, and provides an
unprecedented approach for tailoring Dirac fermions with tunable intervalley
coupling.

  Code Summarization","Accepted by ICPC 2022",,,,"cs.SE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Source code summarization aims to generate natural language descriptions of
code snippets. Many existing studies learn the syntactic and semantic knowledge
of code snippets from their token sequences and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
They use the learned code representations as input to code summarization
models, which can accordingly generate summaries describing source code.
Traditional models traverse ASTs as sequences or split ASTs into paths as
input. However, the former loses the structural properties of ASTs, and the
latter destroys the overall structure of ASTs. Therefore, comprehensively
capturing the structural features of ASTs in learning code representations for
source code summarization remains a challenging problem to be solved. In this
paper, we propose M2TS, a Multi-scale Multi-modal approach based on Transformer
for source code Summarization. M2TS uses a multi-scale AST feature extraction
method, which can extract the structures of ASTs more completely and accurately
at multiple local and global levels. To complement missing semantic information
in ASTs, we also obtain code token features, and further combine them with the
extracted AST features using a cross modality fusion method that not only fuses
the syntactic and contextual semantic information of source code, but also
highlights the key features of each modality. We conduct experiments on two
Java and one Python datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that
M2TS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We release our code at

open-domain dialogue systems as they facilitate hyper-parameter tuning and

metrics is strongly dependent on the quality of training data. Prior works
mainly resort to heuristic text-level manipulations (e.g. utterances shuffling)
to bootstrap incoherent conversations (negative examples) from coherent
dialogues (positive examples). Such approaches are insufficient to
appropriately reflect the incoherence that occurs in interactions between
advanced dialogue models and humans. To tackle this problem, we propose DEAM, a
Dialogue coherence Evaluation metric that relies on Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) to apply semantic-level Manipulations for incoherent
(negative) data generation. AMRs naturally facilitate the injection of various
types of incoherence sources, such as coreference inconsistency, irrelevancy,
contradictions, and decrease engagement, at the semantic level, thus resulting
in more natural incoherent samples. Our experiments show that DEAM achieves
higher correlations with human judgments compared to baseline methods on
several dialog datasets by significant margins. We also show that DEAM can
distinguish between coherent and incoherent dialogues generated by baseline
manipulations, whereas those baseline models cannot detect incoherent examples
generated by DEAM. Our results demonstrate the potential of AMR-based semantic

advances in Machine Learning, and the promises of neural accelerators and
software defined radios. We identify and address multiple challenges, resulting
in a convolutional neural network architecture and models for a multi-antenna
system to infer the existence of interference, the number of interfering
emissions and their respective phases. This information is continuously fed
into an algorithm that cancels the interfering signal. We develop a two-antenna
prototype system and evaluate our jamming cancellation approach in various
environment settings and modulation schemes using Software Defined Radio
platforms. We demonstrate that the receiving node equipped with our approach
can detect a jammer with over 99% of accuracy and achieve a Bit Error Rate
(BER) as low as $10^{-6}$ even when the jammer power is nearly two orders of
magnitude (18 dB) higher than the legitimate signal, and without requiring
modifications to the link modulation. In non-adversarial settings, our approach
can have other advantages such as detecting and mitigating collisions.

A technology that synergistically uses both of these advanced tools would make

how to estimate a TD between two sensors. These methods can then be easily
adapted for multiple TDs by applying them to every pair of a reference sensor

multidimensional CC (MCC) as the objective function, which is derived on the
basis of maximum likelihood estimation. To maximize the MCC, which is a
nonconvex function, we derive the auxiliary function for the MCC and design
efficient update rules. We additionally estimate the amplitudes of the transfer

transition of the state which is characterized by a variable known as shock.
The first stage is cognitive decision-making in which each agent selects one of
multiple information sources (ISs) and then acquires information about the
shock from his selected IS. In the second stage, each agent takes an action
based on the information provided by his selected IS. There is a rational
Bayesian persuader who controls one IS and aims to influence the agents'
actions to induce her desired dynamic equilibria by solely crafting the
information structure of her IS. We refer to such persuasion as forward-looking
dynamic persuasion. We restrict attention to a direct persuasion in which the
persuader incentivizes the agents to select her IS at the first stage and
consider an equilibrium concept known as pipelined perfect Markov Bayesian
equilibrium (PPME). We propose a novel design principle termed fixed-point
alignment that captures the observation that the agents' strategic interactions
in the second stage induce an indirect cognitive competition (i.e., IS
selection) in the first stage and formulate the direct Bayesian persuasion in
PPME as a constrained non-linear optimization problem. By decomposing the
optimization problem into a two-stage local process, we then provide a class of
verifiable necessary and sufficient condition referred to as local
admissibility of the direct Bayesian persuasion in PPME. A case study is
provided in which we obtain a myopic version of local admissibility, by solving
a series of static problems which is homogeneous with respect to the state
variable.

covariate effect specification on the time to event hazards, the semiparametric

function for changing value of the covariates. The ARM is a flexible model,
allowing the estimation of both time-independent and time-varying covariates.
It has a nonparametric component and a regression component identified by a

maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation of the nonparametric and the
finite-dimensional components of the model via the minorize-maximize (MM)
algorithm for case-II interval-censored data. The operating characteristics of
our proposed MM approach are assessed via simulation studies, with illustration
on a breast cancer dataset via the R package MMIntAdd. It is expected that the

techniques. Our approach and system DEFORM, a Deep Learning (DL) based RX
beamforming achieves significant gain for multi antenna RF receivers while
being agnostic to the transmitted signal features (e.g., modulation or
bandwidth). It is well known that combining coherent RF signals from multiple
antennas results in a beamforming gain proportional to the number of receiving
elements. However in practice, this approach heavily relies on explicit channel
estimation techniques, which are link specific and require significant
communication overhead to be transmitted to the receiver. DEFORM addresses this
challenge by leveraging Convolutional Neural Network to estimate the channel
characteristics in particular the relative phase to antenna elements. It is
specifically designed to address the unique features of wireless signals
complex samples, such as the ambiguous $2\pi$ phase discontinuity and the high
sensitivity of the link Bit Error Rate. The channel prediction is subsequently
used in the Maximum Ratio Combining algorithm to achieve an optimal combination
of the received signals. While being trained on a fixed, basic RF settings, we
show that DEFORM DL model is universal, achieving up to 3 dB of SNR gain for a
two antenna receiver in extensive experiments demonstrating various settings of
modulations, bandwidths, and channels. The universality of DEFORM is
demonstrated through joint beamforming relaying of LoRa (Chirp Spread Spectrum
modulation) and ZigBee signals, achieving significant improvements to Packet
Loss/Delivery Rates relatively to conventional Amplify and Forward (LoRa PLR
reduced by 23 times and ZigBee PDR increased by 8 times).

mechanism limits the learning capacity of detectors. In this paper, we explore
a new weighting paradigm, termed dual weighting (DW), to specify pos and neg
weights separately. We first identify the key influential factors of pos/neg
weights by analyzing the evaluation metrics in object detection, and then
design the pos and neg weighting functions based on them. Specifically, the pos
weight of a sample is determined by the consistency degree between its
classification and localization scores, while the neg weight is decomposed into
two terms: the probability that it is a neg sample and its importance
conditioned on being a neg sample. Such a weighting strategy offers greater
flexibility to distinguish between important and less important samples,
resulting in a more effective object detector. Equipped with the proposed DW
method, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector can reach 41.5% mAP on COCO under 1x

baselines on COCO by a large margin under various backbones without bells and

transformations that do not alter an input's class. Many problems have
""class-agnostic"" nuisance transformations that apply similarly to all classes,
such as lighting and background changes for image classification. Neural
networks can learn these invariances given sufficient data, but many real-world
datasets are heavily class imbalanced and contain only a few examples for most
of the classes. We therefore pose the question: how well do neural networks
transfer class-agnostic invariances learned from the large classes to the small
ones? Through careful experimentation, we observe that invariance to
class-agnostic transformations is still heavily dependent on class size, with
the networks being much less invariant on smaller classes. This result holds
even when using data balancing techniques, and suggests poor invariance
transfer across classes. Our results provide one explanation for why
classifiers generalize poorly on unbalanced and long-tailed distributions.
Based on this analysis, we show how a generative approach for learning the
nuisance transformations can help transfer invariances across classes and
improve performance on a set of imbalanced image classification benchmarks.

operations, have been receiving a lot of attention in the design of lightweight
symmetric ciphers. For their differential cryptanalysis, most automatic search
methods of differential trails adopt the assumption of independence of modulo
additions. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold when the trail
includes consecutive modular additions (CMAs). It has already been found that
in this case some differential trails searched by automatic methods before are
actually impossible, but the study is not in depth yet, for example, few effort
has been paid to exploiting the root causes of non-independence between CMAs
and accurate calculation of probabilities of the valid trails. In this paper,
we devote to solving these two problems. By examing the differential equations
of single and consecutive modular additions, we find that the influence of
non-independence can be described by relationships between constraints on the
intermediate state of two additions. Specifically, constraints of the first
addition can make some of its output bits non-uniform, and when they meet the
constraints of the second addition, the differential probability of the whole
CMA may be different from the value calculated under the independence
assumption. As a result, we can build SAT models to verify the validity of a
given differential trail of ARX ciphers and #SAT models to calculate the exact
probabilities of the differential propagation through CMAs in the trail,
promising a more accurate evaluation of probability of the trail. Our automic
methods and searching tools are applied to search related-key differential
trails of SPECK and Chaskey including CMAs in the key schedule and the round
function respectively.

of the statue by the local people is related by chance to a historic event in
the Marshall Islands. Prof. Yukawa's visit to attend the unveiling ceremony
occurred just after news that Japanese fishermen were heavily injured by atomic
testing at the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. At the news conference when
he arrived at Kochi, he was unexpectedly asked about his attitude to the bomb
testing by the US. He was considered to be the foremost top scientist in
nuclear science in Japan at that time, having been awarded the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1949. People in Kochi were very anxious about the test since many
fishermen worked near Bikini Atoll. Contrary to the expectation of local
people, he refused to comment on the matter at the news conference and in
public lectures, which were held several times during his stay in Kochi. After
returning to Kyoto, he issued the famous statement titled Nuclear Era and the
Turning Point of Mankind in an influential national newspaper. This was a time
in Prof. Yukawa's life when he had to reflect and consult his conscience, and
he chose to take a principled stance that became a turning point in his life.
After the visit to Kochi, he devoted himself with his wife to the peace
movement against nuclear weapons. Looking back, it can be observed that the
visit in 1954 to attend the unveiling ceremony of his bronze statue in Kochi
marked the start of that change. The statue can be seen to symbolize not only
his Nobel Prize but also the turning point in his life that led him to support

categories. To address the above issues, we propose to directly explore the
intrinsic pixel distributions of target domain data, instead of heavily relying
on the source domain. Specifically, we simultaneously cluster pixels and
rectify pseudo labels with the obtained cluster assignments. This process is
done in an online fashion so that pseudo labels could co-evolve with the
segmentation model without extra training rounds. To overcome the class
imbalance problem on long-tailed categories, we employ a distribution alignment
technique to enforce the marginal class distribution of cluster assignments to
be close to that of pseudo labels. The proposed method, namely Class-balanced
Pixel-level Self-Labeling (CPSL), improves the segmentation performance on
target domain over state-of-the-arts by a large margin, especially on
long-tailed categories.

component of interstellar magnetic fields in two dimensions. Its potential to
access three-dimensional magnetic fields, including the inclination angle of
the magnetic fields relative to the line-of-sight (LOS), is crucial for a
variety of astrophysical problems. Based on the statistical features of
observed polarization fraction and POS Alfv\'en Mach number $\overline{M_{\rm
A}}_{,\bot}$ distribution, we present a new method for estimating the
inclination angle. The magnetic field fluctuations raised by anisotropic
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are taken into account in our method. By
using synthetic dust emission generated from 3D compressible MHD turbulence
simulations, we show that the fluctuations are preferentially perpendicular to
the mean magnetic field. We find the inclination angle is the major agent for
depolarization, while fluctuations of magnetic field strength and density have
an insignificant contribution. We propose and demonstrate that the mean
inclination angle over a region of interest can be calculated from the
polarization fraction in a strongly magnetized reference position, where
$\overline{M_{\rm A}}_{,\bot}^2\ll1$. We test and show that the new method can
trace the 3D magnetic fields in sub-Alfv\'enic, trans-Alfv\'enic, and
moderately super-Alfv\'enic conditions ($0.4\lesssim M_{\rm A}\lesssim1.2$). We
numerically quantify that the difference between the estimated inclination
angle and actual inclination angle ranges from 0 to $20^\circ$ with a median
value of $\le10^\circ$.

Specifically, we achieve customization by learning a set of base sub-networks

customization with high efficiency in communication, storage, and inference.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method provides better in-situ

applied to deal with such inconsistencies in order to obtain accurate
simulations. This often entails dealing with negative values for the
concentration of chemicals, exceeding a percentage value over 100, and other
such problems. We consider these inconsistencies in the context of partial

optimization to deal with the inconsistencies observed in polynomial-based

involved in solving the problems related to structure preservation. We present
the construction and application of a structure-preserving filter with a focus

and a lack of knowledge about stable and dexterous manipulation skills. This
paper presents a goal-conditioned dual-action deep imitation learning (DIL)
which can learn dexterous manipulation skills using human demonstration data.
Previous DIL methods map the current sensory input and reactive action, which
easily fails because of compounding errors in imitation learning caused by
recurrent computation of actions. The proposed method predicts reactive action
when the precise manipulation of the target object is required (local action)
and generates the entire trajectory when the precise manipulation is not
required. This dual-action formulation effectively prevents compounding error
with the trajectory-based global action while respond to unexpected changes in
the target object with the reactive local action. Furthermore, in this
formulation, both global/local actions are conditioned by a goal state which is
defined as the last step of each subtask, for robust policy prediction. The
proposed method was tested in the real dual-arm robot and successfully
accomplished the banana peeling task.

significant fraction of solids is not growing past the pebble-sizes. The

centrifuge preconditioning, a novel method applied prior to smoothing that
rotates the links away from the center while preserving the fundamental
structure of the vortex field. Additionally, the concept of vortex-preserved
annealed smoothing is formulated to ensure the smoothing procedure maintains
the underlying vortex structure. The application of these new methods in the
context of annealed smoothing applied to vortex fields is shown to successfully
achieve the desired smoothness condition required for the study of more
advanced operators.

two similarity scorers, and a post-processing network are jointly optimized to
predict the encoded labels according to the similarities between speech
features and speaker embeddings. Experimental results show that SEND has a
stable learning process and can be trained on highly overlapped data without

the prototypical verbalizer (ProtoVerb) which is built directly from training

contrastive learning. In this way, the prototypes summarize training instances
and are able to enclose rich class-level semantics. We conduct experiments on

that ProtoVerb significantly outperforms current automatic verbalizers,

off-the-shelf optical flow algorithms to estimate the bidirectional flows and
interpolate the missing frames accordingly. Though having achieved a great
success, these methods require much human experience to tune the bidirectional
flows and often generate unpleasant results when the estimated flows are not
accurate. In this work, we rethink the VFI problem and formulate it as a
continuous image transition (CIT) task, whose key issue is to transition an
image from one space to another space continuously. More specifically, we learn
to implicitly decouple the images into a translatable flow space and a
non-translatable feature space. The former depicts the translatable states
between the given images, while the later aims to reconstruct the intermediate
features that cannot be directly translated. In this way, we can easily perform
image interpolation in the flow space and intermediate image synthesis in the
feature space, obtaining a CIT model. The proposed space decoupled learning
(SDL) approach is simple to implement, while it provides an effective framework
to a variety of CIT problems beyond VFI, such as style transfer and image
morphing. Our extensive experiments on a variety of CIT tasks demonstrate the

so as to query the entire video with the language expression in an efficient
manner. The memory is designed to involve two components -- one for
persistently preserving global video content, and one for dynamically gathering
local temporal context and segmentation history. Based on the memorized
local-global context and the particular content of each frame, Locater
holistically and flexibly comprehends the expression as an adaptive query
vector for each frame. The vector is used to query the corresponding frame for
mask generation. The memory also allows Locater to process videos with linear
time complexity and constant size memory, while Transformer-style
self-attention computation scales quadratically with sequence length. To
thoroughly examine the visual grounding capability of LVS models, we contribute

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a first-order insulator-to-metal transition

transient long-lived monoclinic metallic phase with femtosecond

mega-electron-volt ultrafast electron diffraction. Benefitting from the well
separated diffraction spots and high temporal resolution, we found no evidence
for the transient monoclinic metallic phase through the accurate measurements
of the photoinduced evolution of the diffraction intensity in the momentum
space. Based on the laser fluence thresholds measured at various temperatures,
we suggest that the phase transition threshold is thermally driven although the
transition occurs within 200 femtoseconds, highlighting the interplay of the
electron-electron correlation and the lattice vibrations in driving the phase

modified Bayesian inference method is ""cutting feedback"" which can be used when
the model consists of a number of coupled modules, with only some of the
modules being misspecified. Cutting feedback methods represent the full
posterior distribution in terms of conditional and sequential components, and
then modify some terms in such a representation based on the modular structure
for specification or computation of a modified posterior distribution. The main
goal of this is to avoid contamination of inferences for parameters of interest
by misspecified modules. Computation for cut posterior distributions is
challenging, and here we consider cutting feedback for likelihood-free
inference based on Gaussian mixture approximations to the joint distribution of
parameters and data summary statistics. We exploit the fact that marginal and
conditional distributions of a Gaussian mixture are Gaussian mixtures to give
explicit approximations to marginal or conditional posterior distributions so
that we can easily approximate cut posterior analyses. The mixture approach
allows repeated approximation of posterior distributions for different data
based on a single mixture fit, which is important for model checks which aid in
the decision of whether to ""cut"". A semi-modular approach to likelihood-free
inference where feedback is partially cut is also developed. The benefits of
the method are illustrated in two challenging examples, a collective cell

a linear combination of the covariates of the chosen action, but the player
only observes a biased evaluation of this reward, depending on the sensitive
attribute. To characterize the difficulty of this problem, we design a phased
elimination algorithm that corrects the unfair evaluations, and establish upper
bounds on its regret. We show that the worst-case regret is smaller than
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa_*^{1/3}\log(T)^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, where $\kappa_*$ is an
explicit geometrical constant characterizing the difficulty of bias estimation.
We prove lower bounds on the worst-case regret for some sets of actions showing
that this rate is tight up to a possible sub-logarithmic factor. We also derive
gap-dependent upper bounds on the regret, and matching lower bounds for some

ML methods in the field of physical and chemical science. In the optimal case,
they are able to reach accuracy close to the first principles methods with
significantly lowered computational cost. However, often the training of the ML
methods rely on full atomic structures alongside their potential energies, and
applying the force information needs special modifications to standard
algorithms. Here we apply distance-based ML methods to predict force norms and
estimate the directions of the force vectors of the thiolate-protected gold
nanoclusters. The method relies only on local structural information without
energy evaluations. We apply the atomic ML forces on the structure optimization
of the gold-thiolate rings, $\text{Au}_{25}(\text{SCH}_{3})_{18}$ nanocluster
and two known structural isomers of the $\text{Au}_{38}(\text{SCH}_{3})_{24}$

structural optimizations of the gold-thiolate systems, where the atomic bonding
has a covalent nature in the ligand shell and at the metal-ligand interface.
The methodology could be seen as an early attempt to introduce equivariant

constitutive models, often in the form of constrained ordinary differential
equations. These models have a very limited number of parameters, yet, they are
extremely efficient in reproducing complex responses observed in experiments.
Additionally, in their discretized form, they are computationally very
efficient, often resulting in a simple algebraic relation, and therefore they
have been extensively used within large-scale explicit and implicit finite
element models. However, it is very challenging to formulate new constitutive
models, particularly for materials with complex microstructures such as
composites. A recent trend in constitutive modeling leverages complex neural
network architectures to construct complex material responses where a
constitutive model does not yet exist. Whilst very accurate, they suffer from
two deficiencies. First, they are interpolation models and often do poorly in
extrapolation. Second, due to their complex architecture and numerous
parameters, they are inefficient to be used as a constitutive model within a
large-scale finite element model. In this study, we propose a novel approach
based on the physics-informed learning machines for the characterization and
discovery of constitutive models. Unlike data-driven constitutive models, we
leverage foundations of elastoplasticity theory as regularization terms in the
total loss function to find parametric constitutive models that are also
theoretically sound. We demonstrate that our proposed framework can efficiently
identify the underlying constitutive model describing different datasets from

helping cybersecurity teams quantify and refine the resilience of their trained

volumetric attacks that decision tree ensemble models cannot flag. Our first
contribution is to develop a white-box algorithm that takes a trained decision
tree ensemble model and the profile of an intended network-based attack on a
victim class as inputs. It then automatically generates recipes that specify
certain packets on top of the indented attack packets (less than 15% overhead)
that together can bypass the inference model unnoticed. We ensure that the
generated attack instances are feasible for launching on IP networks and
effective in their volumetric impact. Our second contribution develops a method
to monitor the network behavior of connected devices actively, inject
adversarial traffic (when feasible) on behalf of a victim IoT device, and
successfully launch the intended attack. Our third contribution prototypes
AdIoTack and validates its efficacy on a testbed consisting of a handful of

we use the BH hyperaccretion model to investigate BH mass growth based on
observational GRB data. The results show that (i) if the initial BH mass is set
as $3~M_\odot$, the neutrino annihilation processes are capable of fueling the
BHs to escape the lower mass gap for more than half of long-duration GRBs

LGRBs; (ii) the mean BH mass growths in the case of LGRBs without observable
supernova (SN) association are much larger than these in the case of LGRBs
associated with SNe for both mechanisms, which imply that more massive
progenitors or lower SN explosion energies prevail throughout the former cases;
(iii) for the short-duration GRBs, the mean BH mass growths are satisfied with
the mass supply limitation in the scenario of compact object mergers, but the
hyperaccretion processes are unable to rescue BHs from the gap in binary

vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some
extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the

geographies. Results revealed differentiated pathways of depopulation in
continental sub-regions, with consistent and rapid declines in the east,
persistent but moderate declines in central Europe, accelerating declines in
the south and decelerating population declines in the west. Results also
revealed differentiated patterns of depopulation across the rural-urban
continuum, with urban and populous areas experiencing deceleration in
population decline, while population decline accelerates or stabilises in rural
areas. Small and mid-sized areas displayed heterogeneous depopulation
trajectories, highlighting the importance of local contextual factors in

a single machine with the objective to minimize the maximum job lateness is
known to be strongly NP-hard. Here we consider an extended model in which the
compression of the job processing times is allowed. The compression is
accomplished at the cost of involving additional emerging resources, whose use,
however, yields some cost. With a given upper limit $U$ on the total allowable
cost, one wishes to minimize the maximum job lateness. This setting is
realistic in practice because by completing some emerging jobs earlier using
some available resources, the objective function value might be decreased. In
particular, for minimizing the maximum job lateness, shortening the processing
time of specific jobs turns out to be very helpful. Although the generalized
problem remains strongly NP-hard and is considerably more complicated than the
generic non-compressible version, given a ""sufficient amount"" of additional
resources, it might be possible to solve the problem optimally. In particular,
we establish the compression rate for some specific jobs and develop an

new sources vary on time scales of weeks to months and have a variety of light
curve shapes and spectral index properties. Three of the new variable sources
are coincident with multi-wavelength counterparts; and one of these is
coincident with an optical source in deep MeerLICHT images. For most sources,
we cannot eliminate refractive scintillation of active galactic nuclei as the
cause of the variability. These new variable sources represent $2.2\pm0.5$ per

per cent variability found in past radio variability surveys. However, we
expect to find short-term variable sources in the field as well as these 21 new

introducing robots into complicated environments. The recent remarkable
progress of DRL stands on regularization of policy, which allows the policy to
improve stably and efficiently. A popular method, so-called proximal policy
optimization (PPO), and its variants constrain density ratio of the latest and
baseline policies when the density ratio exceeds a given threshold. This
threshold can be designed relatively intuitively, and in fact its recommended
value range has been suggested. However, the density ratio is asymmetric for
its center, and the possible error scale from its center, which should be close
to the threshold, would depend on how the baseline policy is given. In order to
maximize the values of regularization of policy, this paper proposes a new PPO
derived using relative Pearson (RPE) divergence, therefore so-called PPO-RPE,
to design the threshold adaptively. In PPO-RPE, the relative density ratio,
which can be formed with symmetry, replaces the raw density ratio. Thanks to
this symmetry, its error scale from center can easily be estimated, hence, the
threshold can be adapted for the estimated error scale. From three simple
benchmark simulations, the importance of algorithm-dependent threshold design
is revealed. By simulating additional four locomotion tasks, it is verified
that the proposed method statistically contributes to task accomplishment by
appropriately restricting the policy updates.

behavior of these solutions is related to the dynamics of $X$. We consider the
rather unexplored case of sequences of solutions whose energy is not uniformly

more slowly than $r_n^{1/2}$, the limiting nodal set of the solutions converges
to an invariant set of the vector field $X$. The main tool we use is a novel
maximum principle for the solutions with the key property that it remains valid
in the unbounded energy case. As a byproduct, in the usual case of sequences of
solutions with bounded energy, we obtain a new, more straightforward proof of
Taubes's result on the existence of periodic orbits that does not involve a

contrary to what happens in the bounded energy case, when the energy is
unbounded there are no local restrictions to the limiting measures that may

air pollution. However, the complex interaction between the traffic emissions
and the air pollution in the cities has not yet been revealed. In particular,
the spread of the COVID-19 has caused various cities to implement different
traffic restriction policies according to the local epidemic situation, which
provides the possibility to explore the relationship between urban traffic and
air pollution. Here we explore the influence of traffic to air pollution by
reconstructing a multi-layer complex network base on traffic index and air
quality index. We uncover that air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH),
Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle (CCS) and Central China (CC) regions are
significantly influenced by the surrounding traffic conditions after the
outbreak. Under different fights against the epidemic stages, the influence of
traffic in other cities on the air pollution reached the maximum in stage 2
(also called Initial Progress in Containing the Virus). For BTH and CC regions,
the impact of traffic on air quality becomes larger in the first two stages and
then decreases, while for CC, the significant impact occurs in Phase 3 among
regions. For other regions, however, the changes are not evident. Our presented
network-based framework provides a new perspective in the field of
transportation and environment, and maybe helpful to guide the government to

  Mechanics",,"10.1017/jfm.2022.773",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Turbulent mixed convection in channel flows with heterogeneous surfaces is
studied using direct numerical simulations. The relative importance between
buoyancy and shear effects, characterized by the bulk Richardson number $Ri_b$,
is varied in order to cover the flow regimes of forced, mixed and natural
convection, which are associated with different large-scale flow organization.
The heterogeneous surface consists of streamwise-aligned ridges, which are
known to induce secondary motion in case of forced convection. The large-scale
streamwise rolls emerging under smooth-wall mixed convection conditions are
significantly affected by the heterogeneous surfaces and their appearance is
considerably reduced for dense ridge spacings. It is found that the formation
of these rolls requires larger buoyancy forces than over smooth walls due to
the additional drag induced by the ridges. Therefore, the transition from
forced convection structures to rolls is delayed towards larger $Ri_b$ for
spanwise heterogeneous surfaces. The influence of the heterogeneous surface on
the flow organization of mixed convection is particularly pronounced in the
roll-to-cell transition range, where ridges favor the transition to convective
cells at significantly lower $Ri_b$. In addition, the convective cells are
observed to align perpendicular to the ridges with decreasing ridge spacing. We
attribute this reorganization to the fact that flow parallel to the ridges
experience less drag than flow across the ridges, which is energetically more
beneficial. Furthermore, we find that streamwise rolls exhibit very slow
dynamics for $Ri_b=1$ and $Ri_b=3.2$ when the ridge spacing is in the order of
the rolls' width. For these cases the up- and downdrafts of the rolls move
slowly across the entire channel instead of being fixed in space as observed
for the smooth-wall cases.

revealed a diversity of substructures, some possibly planet-related. It is
therefore important to understand the physical and chemical nature of the
protoplanetary building blocks, as well as their spatial distribution, to
better understand planet formation. Since PPVI, the field has seen tremendous
improvements in observational capabilities, enabling both surveys of large
samples of disks and high resolution imaging studies of a few bright disks.
Improvements in data quality and sample size have, however, opened up many
fundamental questions about properties such as the mass budget of disks, its
spatial distribution, and its radial extent. Moreover, the vertical structure
of disks has been studied in greater detail with spatially resolved
observations, providing new insights on vertical layering and temperature
stratification, yet also bringing rise to questions about other properties,
such as material transport and viscosity. Each one of these properties - disk
mass, surface density distribution, outer radius, vertical extent, temperature
structure, and transport - is of fundamental interest as they collectively set
the stage for disk evolution and corresponding planet formation theories. In
this chapter, we will review our understanding of the fundamental properties of
disks including the relevant observational techniques to probe their nature,
modelling methods, and the respective caveats. Finally, we discuss the
implications for theories of disk evolution and planet formation underlining
what new questions have since arisen as our observational facilities have

this reason, spin-1 models have been extensively studied as prototypes for
quadrupolar (spin-nematic) order in magnetic insulators, and Fe-based
superconductors. At the same time, because of the presence of quadrupoles, the
classical limit of a spin-1 moment is not an $O(3)$ vector, a fact which must
be taken into account in describing their properties. In this Article we
develop a method to simulate spin-1 magnets based on a $u(3)$ algebra which
treats both dipole and quadrupole moments on equal footing. This approach is
amenable to both classical and quantum calculations, and we develop the

gleaned from one's voices? Previous works that study this question only adopt
developments in image synthesis and convert voices into face images to show
correlations, but working on the image domain unavoidably involves predicting
attributes that voices cannot hint, including facial textures, hairstyles, and
backgrounds. We instead investigate the ability to reconstruct 3D faces to
concentrate on only geometry, which is much more physiologically grounded. We
propose our analysis framework, Cross-Modal Perceptionist, under both
supervised and unsupervised learning. First, we construct a dataset,
Voxceleb-3D, which extends Voxceleb and includes paired voices and face meshes,
making supervised learning possible. Second, we use a knowledge distillation
mechanism to study whether face geometry can still be gleaned from voices
without paired voices and 3D face data under limited availability of 3D face
scans. We break down the core question into four parts and perform visual and
numerical analyses as responses to the core question. Our findings echo those
in physiology and neuroscience about the correlation between voices and facial

the source speech synthesis model to the target model through the target few
recordings. The solution to constructing a custom voice is to combine an
adaptive acoustic model with a robust vocoder. However, training a robust
vocoder usually requires a multi-speaker dataset, which should include various
age groups and various timbres, so that the trained vocoder can be used for
unseen speakers. Collecting such a multi-speaker dataset is difficult, and the
dataset distribution always has a mismatch with the distribution of the target
speaker dataset. This paper proposes an adaptive vocoder for custom voice from
another novel perspective to solve the above problems. The adaptive vocoder
mainly uses a cross-domain consistency loss to solve the overfitting problem
encountered by the GAN-based neural vocoder in the transfer learning of
few-shot scenes. We construct two adaptive vocoders, AdaMelGAN and AdaHiFi-GAN.
First, We pre-train the source vocoder model on AISHELL3 and CSMSC datasets,
respectively. Then, fine-tune it on the internal dataset VXI-children with few
adaptation data. The empirical results show that a high-quality custom voice
system can be built by combining a adaptive acoustic model with a adaptive

occur in clay rocks which serve as host formations for geological radioactive
waste repositories. Exothermic waste packages heat the rock, causing thermal
strains and temperature induced pore pressure build-up. The drifts are designed
in such a way as to limit these effects. One has to anticipate failure and
fracturing of the material, should pore pressures exceed the tensile resistance
of the rock. To characterise the behaviour of the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone
(COx) under effective tension and to quantify the tensile failure criterion, a
laboratory program is carried out in this work. THM loading paths which
correspond to the expected in situ conditions are recreated in the laboratory.
To this end, a special triaxial system was developed, which allows the
independent control of radial and axial stresses, as well as of pore pressure
and temperature of rock specimens. More importantly, the device allows one to
maintain axial effective tension on a specimen. Saturated cylindrical claystone
specimens were tested in undrained conditions under constrained lateral
deformation and under nearly constant axial stress. The specimens were heated
until the induced pore pressures created effective tensile stresses and
ultimately fractured the material. The failure happened at average axial
effective tensile stresses around 3.0 MPa. Fracturing under different lateral
total stresses allows one to describe the failure with a Hoek-Brown or
Fairhurst's generalized Griffith criterion. Measured axial extension strains
are analysed based on a transversely isotropic thermo-poroelastic constitutive
model, which is able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed behaviour.

encoder-decoder architecture in various vision tasks, we move forwards to
design a new end-to-end Laneformer architecture that revolutionizes the
conventional transformers into better capturing the shape and semantic

with deformable pixel-wise self-attention in the encoder, Laneformer presents
two new row and column self-attention operations to efficiently mine point

would affect the decision of predicting lane segments, Laneformer further
includes the detected object instances as extra inputs of multi-head attention

are added into Key module to provide interaction with each pixel and query
while the ROI-aligned features are inserted into Value module. Extensive

  Network","Accepted for CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To perform adversarial attacks in the physical world, many studies have
proposed adversarial camouflage, a method to hide a target object by applying
camouflage patterns on 3D object surfaces. For obtaining optimal physical
adversarial camouflage, previous studies have utilized the so-called neural
renderer, as it supports differentiability. However, existing neural renderers
cannot fully represent various real-world transformations due to a lack of
control of scene parameters compared to the legacy photo-realistic renderers.
In this paper, we propose the Differentiable Transformation Attack (DTA), a
framework for generating a robust physical adversarial pattern on a target
object to camouflage it against object detection models with a wide range of
transformations. It utilizes our novel Differentiable Transformation Network
(DTN), which learns the expected transformation of a rendered object when the
texture is changed while preserving the original properties of the target
object. Using our attack framework, an adversary can gain both the advantages
of the legacy photo-realistic renderers including various physical-world
transformations and the benefit of white-box access by offering
differentiability. Our experiments show that our camouflaged 3D vehicles can
successfully evade state-of-the-art object detection models in the
photo-realistic environment (i.e., CARLA on Unreal Engine). Furthermore, our
demonstration on a scaled Tesla Model 3 proves the applicability and
transferability of our method to the real world.

This enables the estimator to embed a priori available information about the
distribution in the computations to produce parameter estimates that are
induced by signal components belonging only to the correct class of density
functions being considered. It also enables it to nullify the effect of those
components that do not belong to this class on the estimation process. The
estimator can, with high accuracy, compute quickly the parameters of a wide

developed and basic proofs of correctness are carried-out for the Rayleigh

experiencing fast fading in heavily cluttered environments. Simulation results
demonstrate the capabilities of the suggested procedure and the clear
advantages it has over conventional norm-based estimation techniques. The

acceleration and transport in a superbubble to explain GeV-TeV gamma-ray
spectrum of Cygnus Cocoon, which has a break at the energy of about 1 TeV. It
is shown that the gamma rays produced by hadronic interactions of high-energy
protons accelerated by an ensemble of shocks from winds of massive stars and
supernovae in the Cygnus Cocoon can explain the observations. The proton
spectral shape at the highest energies depends on the MHD-fluctuation spectrum
in the Cocoon. The viable solutions for Cygnus Cocoon may be applied to some
other associations showing similar behaviour. We briefly discuss the similarity
and differences of particle acceleration processes in extended superbubbles and
compact clusters of young massive stars as represented by Westerlund 1 and 2
gamma-ray sources.

embedding a clear path action (voice prompt) into the RL framework, and the

foreground objects into the background images, making them briefly invisible to
the human eye. Previous work has typically been implemented by an iterative
optimization process. However, these methods struggle in 1) efficiently
generating camouflage images using foreground and background with arbitrary
structure; 2) camouflaging foreground objects to regions with multiple
appearances (e.g. the junction of the vegetation and the mountains), which
limit their practical application. To address these problems, this paper
proposes a novel Location-free Camouflage Generation Network (LCG-Net) that
fuse high-level features of foreground and background image, and generate
result by one inference. Specifically, a Position-aligned Structure Fusion
(PSF) module is devised to guide structure feature fusion based on the
point-to-point structure similarity of foreground and background, and introduce
local appearance features point-by-point. To retain the necessary identifiable
features, a new immerse loss is adopted under our pipeline, while a background
patch appearance loss is utilized to ensure that the hidden objects look
continuous and natural at regions with multiple appearances. Experiments show
that our method has results as satisfactory as state-of-the-art in the
single-appearance regions and are less likely to be completely invisible, but
far exceed the quality of the state-of-the-art in the multi-appearance regions.
Moreover, our method is hundreds of times faster than previous methods.
Benefitting from the unique advantages of our method, we provide some
downstream applications for camouflage generation, which show its potential.

Some properties of the counter-rotating flow thickness and counter-rotating

from the counter-rotating tori is determined by the background properties. The
fast spinning BH energetics depends mostly on BH spin rather than on the
properties of the counter-rotating fluids or the tori masses. The turning point
is located in a narrow orbital corona (spherical shell), for photons and matter
flow constituents, surrounding the BH stationary limit (outer ergosurface),
depending on the BH spin-mass ratio and the fluid initial momentum only. The
turning corona for jet-like-flow has larger thickness, it is separated from the
torus flow turning corona and it is closer to the BH stationary limit. Turning
points of matter accreting from torus and from jets are independent explicitly
of the details of the accretion and tori model. The turning corona could be
observable due to an increase of flow luminosity and temperature. The corona is
larger on the BH equatorial plane, where it is the farthest from the central

sensitivity of a multiparameter quantum estimation can beat the standard
quantum limit. However, the presence of noise imposes limitations on the
enhancement of precision due to the inevitable existence of environmental
fluctuations. Here, we address the motivation behind the usage of Gaussian
quantum resources and their advantages in reaching the standard quantum limits
under realistic noise. In this context, our work aims to explore the ultimate
limits of precision for the simultaneous estimation of a pair of parameters
that characterize the displacement channel acting on Gaussian probes and

study the ultimate estimation precision, we evaluate the upper and bottom bound

require an excessive number of queries to attack a single audio example. In
this paper, we introduce NP-Attack, a neural predictor-based method, which
progressively evolves the search towards a small adversarial perturbation.
Given a perturbation direction, our neural predictor directly estimates the
smallest perturbation that causes a mistranscription. In particular, it enables
NP-Attack to accurately learn promising perturbation directions via

miscalibration is unavoidable, raising a fundamental question: how should one
use potentially miscalibrated predictions to inform binary decisions? We
formalize a natural (distribution-free) solution concept: given anticipated
miscalibration of $\alpha$, we propose using the threshold $j$ that minimizes
the worst-case regret over all $\alpha$-miscalibrated predictors, where the
regret is the difference in clinical utility between using the threshold in

(PDC) task as panoramic 3D cameras often produce 360{\deg} depth with missing

deep network that takes both depth and image as inputs for the dense panoramic
depth recovery. However, it needs to face a challenging optimization problem of
the network parameters due to its non-convex objective function. To address
this problem, we propose a simple yet effective approach termed M{^3}PT:
multi-modal masked pre-training. Specifically, during pre-training, we
simultaneously cover up patches of the panoramic RGB image and sparse depth by
shared random mask, then reconstruct the sparse depth in the masked regions. To
our best knowledge, it is the first time that we show the effectiveness of
masked pre-training in a multi-modal vision task, instead of the single-modal
task resolved by masked autoencoders (MAE). Different from MAE where
fine-tuning completely discards the decoder part of pre-training, there is no
architectural difference between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages in our
M$^{3}$PT as they only differ in the prediction density, which potentially
makes the transfer learning more convenient and effective. Extensive
experiments verify the effectiveness of M{^3}PT on three panoramic datasets.
Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art baselines by averagely 26.2% in RMSE,
51.7% in MRE, 49.7% in MAE, and 37.5% in RMSElog on three benchmark datasets.

this work aims to analyze the effect of switching strategies on the estimation
error. The data for identification is assumed to be collected from globally
asymptotically or marginally stable switched systems under switches that are
arbitrary or subject to an average dwell time constraint. Then the switched
system is estimated by the least-squares (LS) estimator. To capture the effect
of the parameters of the switching strategies on the LS estimation error,
finite-sample error bounds are developed in this work. The obtained error
bounds show that the estimation error is logarithmic of the switching
parameters when there are only stable modes; however, when there are unstable
modes, the estimation error bound can increase linearly as the switching
parameter changes. This suggests that in the presence of unstable modes, the
switching strategy should be properly designed to avoid the significant
increase of the estimation error.

be extended to contain covariates. Since the evaluation of the exact likelihood
is difficult or even impossible for these models, score matching was proposed
to avoid explicit computation of the normalizing constant. In the literature,
score matching has so far only been developed for models in which the
observations are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, the
IID assumption does not hold in the traditional fixed design setting for
regression-type models. To deal with the estimation of these
covariate-dependent models, this paper presents a new score matching approach
for independent but not necessarily identically distributed data under a
general framework for both continuous and discrete responses, which includes a
novel generalized score matching method for count response regression. We prove
that our proposed score matching estimators are consistent and asymptotically
normal under mild regularity conditions. The theoretical results are supported
by simulation studies and a real-data example. Additionally, our simulation
results indicate that, compared to approximate maximum likelihood estimation,
the generalized score matching produces estimates with substantially smaller
biases in an application to doctoral publication data.

to dark matter halos centered on galaxies. We additionally constrain the

radial profile of the halo matter density $\rho(r)$. We derive a new

provide strong and robust interfacing between optical signals and quantum

which two low-energy spin-1/2 levels are coupled to a common optically excited
state. We investigate the implementation of EIT with c-axis divacancy color
centers in silicon carbide. While this material has attractive properties for
quantum device technologies with near-IR optics, implementing EIT is
complicated by the inhomogeneous broadening of the optical transitions
throughout the ensemble and the presence of multiple ground-state levels. These
may lead to darkening of the ensemble upon resonant optical excitation. Here,
we show that EIT can be established with high visibility also in this material
platform upon careful design of the measurement geometry. Comparison of our
experimental results with a model based on the Lindblad equations indicates
that we can create coherences between different sets of two levels
all-optically in these systems, with potential impact for RF-free quantum
sensing applications. Our work provides an understanding of EIT in multi-level
systems with significant inhomogeneities, and our considerations are valid for

model; i.e. the interfacial tension coefficient decomposition method is
employed to treat pairings of interfacial tension between the phases. VOF
smoothing is also implemented by applying a Laplacian filter on the
distribution of volume fractions. The rheoMultiFluidInterFoam solver is capable
of fully taking into account complex non-Newtonian effects (e.g. yield stress,
viscoelasticity, etc.) of the involved liquids. To this end, the developed
solver incorporates the RheoTool toolbox (Pimenta and Alves (2017) J.

equations suitable for modelling different types of fluids with complex
rheology. Our solvers are tested for a wide range of different flow setups,
considering typical benchmark two-phase and three-phase flows; flows involving

KUKA LBR iiwa) and one classical industrial manipulator (KUKA Cybertech), in
presence or absence of an industrial protective skin (AIRSKIN). In addition, we
isolate the effects of the passive padding and the active contribution of the
sensor to robot reaction. We present a total of 2250 collision measurements and
study the impact force, contact duration, clamping force, and impulse. The
dataset is publicly available. We summarize our results as follows. For
transient collisions, the passive skin properties lowered the impact forces by
about 40 %. During quasi-static contact, the effect of skin covers -- active or
passive -- cannot be isolated from the collision detection and reaction by the
collaborative robots. Important effects of the stop categories triggered by the
active protective skin were found. We systematically compare the different
settings and the empirically established safe velocities with prescriptions by
the ISO/TS 15066. In some cases, up to the quadruple of the ISO/TS 15066
prescribed velocity can comply with the impact force limits and thus be
considered safe. We propose an extension of the formulas relating impact force
and permissible velocity that take into account the stiffness and compressible
thickness of the protective cover, leading to better predictions of the
collision forces. At the same time, this work emphasizes the need for in situ
measurements as all the factors we studied -- presence of active/passive skin,

structure (Cc2/m) from results gathered in an extensive set of experiments on
an untwined sample of alpha-RuCl3 [R. D. Johnson et al., Phys. Rev. B 92,
235119 (2015)]. The proposed zigzag antiferromagnetic ground state of Ru ions
does not respond to bulk magnetic probes. Properties of the candidate magnetic
structure not previously explored include polar magnetism that supports Ru
Dirac multipoles, e.g., a ruthenium anapole. In a general case, Dirac dipoles
are capable of generating interactions between magnetic ions, as in an
electrical Dzyaloshinskii-Moryia interaction [T. A. Kaplan and S. D. Mahanti,
Phys. Rev. B 83, 174432 (2011) and H. J. Zhao et al., Nat. Mat. 20, 341
(2021)]. Dirac multipoles contribute to the diffraction of both x-rays and
neutrons, and a stringent test of the magnetic structure Cc2/m awaits future
experiments. From symmetry-informed calculations we show that, the magnetic
candidate permits Bragg spots that arise solely from Dirac multipoles.
Stringent tests of Cc2/m can also be accomplished by performing resonant x-ray
diffraction with signal enhancement from the chlorine K-edge. X-ray absorption
spectra published for alpha-RuCl3 possess a significant low-energy feature [K.
W. Plumb et al., Phys. Rev. B 90, 041112(R) (2014)]. Many experimental studies
of other Cl-metal compounds concluded that identical features hallmark the
chemical bond. Using a monoclinic Cc2/m structure, we predict the contribution
to Bragg diffraction at the Cl K-edge absorption. Specifically, the variation
of intensity of Bragg spots with rotation of the sample about the reflection
vector. The two principal topics of our studies, polar magnetism and the
chemical bond in alpha-RuCl3, are brought together in a minimal model of
magnetic Ru ions in Cc2/m.

continual learning by utilizing an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based
growing self-organizing clustering algorithm. The ART-based clustering
algorithm is theoretically capable of continual learning, and the proposed
algorithm independently applies it to each class of training data for
generating classifiers. Whenever an additional training data set from a new
class is given, a new ART-based clustering will be defined in a different
learning space. Thanks to the above-mentioned features, the proposed algorithm
realizes continual learning capability. Simulation experiments showed that the
proposed algorithm has superior classification performance compared with
state-of-the-art clustering-based classification algorithms capable of
continual learning.

dysarthria (HD). In this work, we analysed the power of conventional speech
features quantifying imprecise articulation, dysprosody, speech dysfluency and
speech quality deterioration extracted from a specialized poem recitation task
to discriminate dysarthric and healthy speech. For this purpose, 152 speakers
(53 healthy speakers, 99 PD patients) were examined. Only mildly strong
correlation between speech features and clinical status of the speakers was
observed. In the case of univariate classification analysis, sensitivity of
62.63% (imprecise articulation), 61.62% (dysprosody), 71.72% (speech
dysfluency) and 59.60% (speech quality deterioration) was achieved.
Multivariate classification analysis improved the classification performance.
Sensitivity of 83.42% using only two features describing imprecise articulation
and speech quality deterioration in HD was achieved. We showed the promising
potential of the selected speech features and especially the use of poem
recitation task to quantify and identify HD in PD.

real-valued data into hypergraphs for clustering via spectral embedding. For
graph cut based spectral clustering, it is common to model real-valued data
into graph by modeling pairwise similarities using kernel function. This is
because the kernel function has a theoretical connection to the graph cut. For
problems where using multi-way similarities are more suitable than pairwise
ones, it is natural to model as a hypergraph, which is generalization of a
graph. However, although the hypergraph cut is well-studied, there is not yet
established a hypergraph cut based framework to model multi-way similarity. In
this paper, we formulate multi-way similarities by exploiting the theoretical
foundation of kernel function. We show a theoretical connection between our
formulation and hypergraph cut in two ways, generalizing both weighted kernel
$k$-means and the heat kernel, by which we justify our formulation. We also
provide a fast algorithm for spectral clustering. Our algorithm empirically
shows better performance than existing graph and other heuristic modeling
methods.

$N\geqslant1$ spatially distributed zero-range potentials is presented.
Interactions between the particle and the potentials are modeled by subjecting
a particle's bispinor wave function to certain limiting conditions at the
potential centers. Each of these conditions is parametrized by a $2\times2$
Hermitian matrix (or, equivalently, a real scalar and a real vector) and mixes
the upper and the lower components of the wave function. The problem of
determining particle's bound-state eigenenergies is reduced to the problem of
finding real zeroes of a determinant of a certain $2N\times2N$ matrix. As the
lower component of the particle's wave function is inverse-square singular at
each of the potential centers, the wave function itself is not
square-integrable. Nevertheless, one can define a scalar pseudo-product with
the property that wave functions belonging to different eigenenergies are
orthogonal with respect to it. The wave functions may then be normalized so
that their self-pseudo-products are plus one, minus one or zero. An auxiliary
set of Sturmian functions is constructed and used to derive an explicit
representation of particle's matrix Green's function. For illustration
purposes, two particular systems are studied in detail: 1) a particle bound in
a field of a single zero-range potential, 2) a particle bound in a field of two
identical zero-range potentials.

similar words. It visualises their formation, change, and demise. There are two
main approaches to the exploration of dynamic networks: the discrete one
compares a series of clustered graphs from separate points in time. The
continuous one analyses the changes of one dynamic network over a time-span.
SCoT offers a new hybrid solution. First, it aggregates time-stamped documents
into intervals and calculates one sense graph per discrete interval. Then, it
merges the static graphs to a new type of dynamic semantic neighbourhood graph
over time. The resulting sense clusters offer uniquely detailed insights into
lexical change over continuous intervals with model transparency and
provenance. SCoT has been successfully used in a European study on the changing
meaning of `crisis'.

technology with a wide range of applications. Given the task's complexity, best
results have typically been reported for systems focusing on specific settings,
e.g. instrument-specific systems tend to yield improved results over
instrument-agnostic methods. Similarly, higher accuracy can be obtained when
only estimating frame-wise $f_0$ values and neglecting the harder note event
detection. Despite their high accuracy, such specialized systems often cannot
be deployed in the real-world. Storage and network constraints prohibit the use
of multiple specialized models, while memory and run-time constraints limit
their complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight neural network for
musical instrument transcription, which supports polyphonic outputs and
generalizes to a wide variety of instruments (including vocals). Our model is
trained to jointly predict frame-wise onsets, multipitch and note activations,
and we experimentally show that this multi-output structure improves the
resulting frame-level note accuracy. Despite its simplicity, benchmark results
show our system's note estimation to be substantially better than a comparable
baseline, and its frame-level accuracy to be only marginally below those of
specialized state-of-the-art AMT systems. With this work we hope to encourage
the community to further investigate low-resource, instrument-agnostic AMT
systems.

Fourier coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ for midrapidity ($|\eta|<0.35$) charged
hadrons in 0\%--5\% central $p$$+$Au, $d$$+$Au, and $^3$He$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV utilizing three sets of two-particle correlations
for two detector combinations with different pseudorapidity acceptance [Phys.
Rev. C {\bf 105}, 024901 (2022)]. This paper extends these measurements of
$v_2$ to all centralities in $p$$+$Au, $d$$+$Au, and $^3$He$+$Au collisions, as
well as $p$$+$$p$ collisions, as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and
event multiplicity. The kinematic dependence of $v_2$ is quantified as the
ratio $R$ of $v_2$ between the two detector combinations as a function of event
multiplicity for $0.5$$<$$p_T$$<$$1$ and $2$$<$$p_T$$<$$2.5$ GeV/$c$. A
multiphase-transport (AMPT) model can reproduce the observed $v_2$ in
most-central to midcentral $d$$+$Au and $^3$He$+$Au collisions. However, the
AMPT model systematically overestimates the measurements in $p$$+$$p$,
$p$$+$Au, and peripheral $d$$+$Au and $^3$He$+$Au collisions, indicating a
higher nonflow contribution in AMPT than in the experimental data. The AMPT
model fails to describe the observed $R$ for $0.5$$<$$p_T$$<$$1$ GeV/$c$, but
there is qualitative agreement with the measurements for $2$$<$$p_T$$<$$2.5$
GeV/$c$.

properties of peaks in different energy domains. Bayesian spectral
deconvolution regresses spectral data into the sum of multiple basis functions.
Conventional methods use a model that treats all peaks equally. However, in
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra, the properties of the
peaks differ depending on the energy domain, and the specific energy domain of
XANES is essential in condensed matter physics. We propose a model that
discriminates between the low- and high-energy domains. We also propose a prior
distribution that reflects the physical properties. We compare the conventional
and proposed models in terms of computational efficiency, estimation accuracy,
and model evidence. We demonstrate that our method effectively estimates the
number of transition components in the important energy domain, on which the
material scientists focus for mapping the electronic transition analysis by
first-principles simulation.

of the five-dimensional cubic lattice to two dimensions. A single parameter,
the sum of intercepts $\Gamma=\sum_j \gamma_j$, describes this family. Each
value of $0\le \Gamma \le \frac{1}{2}$ defines a unique local isomorphism class
for these quasicrystals, with $\Gamma=0$ giving the Penrose lattice. Except for
a few special values of $\Gamma$, these lattices lack simple
inflation-deflation rules making it hard to count how frequently a given local
configuration is repeated. We consider the vertex-tight-binding model on these
quasicrystals and investigate the strictly localized states (LS) for all values
of $\Gamma$. We count the frequency of localized states both by numerical exact
diagonalization on lattices of $~10^5$ sites and by identifying localized state
types and calculating their perpendicular space images. While the imbalance
between the number of sites of the sublattices of the bipartite quasicrystal
grows monotonically with $\Gamma$, we find that the localized state fraction
first decreases and then increases as the distance from the Penrose lattice
grows. The highest LS fraction of $~10.17\%$ is attained at $\Gamma=0.5$ while
the minimum is $~4.5\%$ at $\Gamma \simeq 0.12$. The LS on the even sublattice
are generally concentrated near sites with high symmetry, while the LS on the
odd sublattice are more uniformly distributed. The odd sublattice has a higher
LS fraction, having almost three times the LS frequency of the even sublattice
at $\Gamma=0.5$. We identify 20 LS types on the even sublattice, and their
total frequency agrees well with the numerical exact diagonalization result for
all values of $\Gamma$. For the odd sublattice, we identify 45 LS types.
However, their total frequency remains significantly below the numerical
calculation, indicating the possibility of more independent LS types.

electric fields, in order to quickly raise the plasma current and temperature,
allowing the plasma to fully ionize and magnetic flux surfaces to form. Such
conditions are ideal for the formation of superthermal electrons, which may
reduce the efficiency of ohmic heating and prevent the formation of a healthy
thermal fusion plasma. This is of particular concern in ITER where engineering
limitations put restrictions on the allowable electric fields and limit the
prefill densities during start-up. In this study, we present a new 0D
burn-through simulation tool called STREAM (STart-up Runaway Electron Analysis
Model), which self-consistently evolves the plasma density, temperature and
electric field, while accounting for the generation and loss of relativistic
runaway electrons. After verifying the burn-through model, we investigate
conditions under which runaway electrons can form during tokamak start-up as
well as their effects on the plasma initiation. We find that Dreicer generation
plays a crucial role in determining whether a discharge becomes
runaway-dominated or not, and that a large number of runaway electrons could
limit the ohmic heating of the plasma, thus preventing successful burn-through
or further ramp-up of the plasma current. The runaway generation can be
suppressed by raising the density via gas fuelling, but only if done
sufficiently early. Otherwise a large runaway seed may have already been built
up, which can avalanche even at relatively low electric fields and high
densities.

region in objects, which faces the challenge of establishing an explicit link
with object parts due to the diversity of interactive affordance. Human has the
ability that transform the various exocentric interactions to invariant
egocentric affordance so as to counter the impact of interactive diversity. To
empower an agent with such ability, this paper proposes a task of affordance
grounding from exocentric view, i.e., given exocentric human-object interaction
and egocentric object images, learning the affordance knowledge of the object
and transferring it to the egocentric image using only the affordance label as
supervision. To this end, we devise a cross-view knowledge transfer framework
that extracts affordance-specific features from exocentric interactions and
enhances the perception of affordance regions by preserving affordance
correlation. Specifically, an Affordance Invariance Mining module is devised to
extract specific clues by minimizing the intra-class differences originated
from interaction habits in exocentric images. Besides, an Affordance
Co-relation Preserving strategy is presented to perceive and localize

high-energy $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr to $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru collisions is a clean
probe of the neutron-skin thickness of colliding nuclei and the slope parameter
$L$ of the symmetry energy. The idea is demonstrated based on the proton and
neutron density distributions via a state-of-the-art
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculation. Among spectator nucleons given by
the Glauber model, free spectator neutrons include those from direct production
that survive from clusterization as well as those from deexcitation of heavy
clusters described by the popular GEMINI model. More free neutrons are produced
in collisions of $^{96}$Zr nucleus due to its larger neutron skin, compared to
those produced in collisions of $^{96}$Ru nucleus with a smaller neutron skin.
The difference of the free spectator neutron yield is further increased with
the increasing difference of the neutron-skin thickness between $^{96}$Zr and
$^{96}$Ru with a larger $L$ value, and the increase in ultracentral collisions
is particularly insensitive to model details and experimental uncertainties.
Since the production of free spectator neutrons is not affected by the
complicated dynamics in the mid-rapidity region, the ratio of their
multiplicities in ultracentral isobaric collisions is a robust observable for
constraining the neutron skin and $L$ value.

star-forming region, especially of its most massive disk and stellar
population. Now, near-complete surveys of multiple star-forming regions cover
both spectroscopy of young stars and mm interferometry of their protoplanetary

evolutionary stages, ages, and environments. At the same time, surveys of
debris disks are revealing the bulk properties of this class of more evolved
objects. This chapter reviews the statistics of these measured global star and
disk properties and discusses their constraints on theoretical models
describing global disk evolution. Our comparisons of observations to
theoretical model predictions extends beyond the traditional viscous evolution
framework to include analytical descriptions of magnetic wind effects. Finally,
we discuss how recent observational results can provide a framework for models

methods of estimating the covariance matrices in the normal distributions are

decision support. Secondly, these named entities in the utterance might be
discontinuous and scattered across sentences and speakers. These also make it
difficult to annotate a large corpus which is essential for most methods.
Therefore, we first define a multi-hierarchical state structure. We annotate

knowledge, there are no publicly available ones before. Then we propose a
Prompt-based Generative Approach which can generate slot values with

in improved intrinsic ductility. Enthalpy is maximum at the equiatomic
concentrations indicating the highly repulsive interaction between the alloy

materials with the transverse magnetization under the excitation of the surface
plasmon polariton waves. The effect originates from the interplay of the two
magnetization-dependent contributions to the material absorption, both of which
are enhanced under plasmon excitation. Similar to the recently discovered
effect of a all-optical helicity-dependent magnetization switching, this effect
provides a possibility to perform a deterministic magnetization switching to
the desired state. We show by electromagnetic modeling that laser pulses
exciting counter-propagating plasmons can be used to write +M or -M state in a
deterministic way independent on the initial magnetization state. The presented
approach applies to various ferrimagnetic materials exhibiting the phenomenon
of all-optical switching of thermal nature and broadens the horizons of their
applications in data storage devices.

360-degree RGB-D image based on the neural radiance field (NeRF) . Prior
studies relied on the neighborhood interpolation capability of multi-layer
perceptrons to complete missing regions caused by occlusion and zooming, which
leads to artifacts. In the method proposed in this study, the input image is
reprojected to 360-degree RGB images at other camera positions, the missing
regions of the reprojected images are completed by a 2D image generative model,
and the completed images are utilized to train the NeRF. Because multiple
completed images contain inconsistencies in 3D, we introduce a method to learn
the NeRF model using a subset of completed images that cover the target scene
with less overlap of completed regions. The selection of such a subset of
images can be attributed to the maximum weight independent set problem, which
is solved through simulated annealing. Experiments demonstrated that the
proposed method can synthesize plausible novel views while preserving the
features of the scene for both artificial and real-world data.

disfluent text generation has not been widely explored. To generate more
human-like texts, we addressed disfluent text generation. The usage of
disfluency, such as FPs, rephrases, and word fragments, differs from speaker to
speaker, and thus, the generation of personalized FPs is required. However, it
is difficult to predict them because of the sparsity of position and the
frequency difference between more and less frequently used FPs. Moreover, it is
sometimes difficult to adapt FP prediction models to each speaker because of
the large variation of the tendency within each speaker. To address these
issues, we propose a method to build group-dependent prediction models by
grouping speakers on the basis of their tendency to use FPs. This method does
not require a large amount of data and time to train each speaker model. We
further introduce a loss function and a word embedding model suitable for FP
prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that group-dependent models
can predict FPs with higher scores than a non-personalized one and the
introduced loss function and word embedding model improve the prediction
performance.

appropriate scheduling functions. Further, we extend the RST to a general
framework (G-RST), where we can adjust regularization degree on sharpness
freely for any scheduling function. We show that G-RST can outperform SAM in
most cases while saving 50\% extra computation cost.

mechanisms, called moving phantom mechanisms. Among others, they propose a
proportional mechanism, in the sense that in the extreme case where all agents
prefer a single project to receive the whole amount, the budget is assigned

defined over a limited type of preference profiles. To address this, we expand
the notion of proportionality, by proposing a quantitative framework which
evaluates a budget aggregation mechanism according to its worst-case distance
from the proportional allocation. Crucially, this is defined for every
preference profile. We study this measure on the class of moving phantom
mechanisms, and we provide approximation guarantees. For two projects, we show
that the Uniform Phantom mechanism is the optimal among all truthful

near-isotropic resolution and T1-weighted (T1w) MRI contrast, which are
prevalent in research settings. As a result, existing tools tend to adapt
poorly to other image types, such as stacks of thick slices acquired with fast

Unruh-DeWitt detector approach to probe thermal, quantum effects on static,
non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes. In this context, all physical observables
depend on the choice of a boundary condition that cannot be singled-out, in
general, without resorting to an experiment. Notwithstanding, the framework
applied admits a large family of (Robin) boundary conditions and grants us
physically-sensible dynamics and two-point functions of local Hadamard form. I
discover that the anti-Unruh/Hawking effects are not manifest for thermal
states on the BTZ black hole, nor on massless topological black holes of four
dimensions. Whilst the physical significance of these statistical effects
remains puzzling, my work corroborates their non-trivial relation with the KMS
condition and reveals the pivotal influence of the spacetime dimension in their
manifestation. On global monopoles, I find that for massless minimally coupled
fields the transition rate, the thermal fluctuations and the energy density
remain finite at the singularity only for Dirichlet boundary condition. For
conformally coupled fields, although the energy density diverges for all
boundary conditions, the transition rate and the thermal fluctuations vanish at
the monopole; indicating that even if there is infinite energy, no spontaneous
emission occur if the quantum field is not fluctuating. Moreover, I explicitly
construct two-point functions for ground and thermal states on Lifshitz
topological black holes, setting the ground for future explorations in this

then perform a statistical analysis based on molecular descriptors to identify

us to identify structural features that are correlated with high absorption

NFAs should possess a planar, linear, and fully conjugated molecular backbone
with highly polarisable heteroatoms. We then exploit a random decision forest

dimensional surfaces embedded in a five dimensional spatial-chromatic space. In
this case, a natural regularization term arises as the image surface area.
Choosing the chromatic coordinates as dominating over the spatial ones, the
image spatial coordinates could be thought of as a paramterization of the image
surface manifold in a three dimensional color space. Minimizing the area of the
image manifold leads to the Beltrami flow or mean curvature flow of the image
surface in the 3D color space, while minimizing the elastica of the image
surface yields an additional interesting regularization. Recently, the authors
proposed a color elastica model, which minimizes both the surface area and
elastica of the image manifold. In this paper, we propose to modify the color
elastica and introduce two new models for color image regularization. The
revised measures are motivated by the relations between the color elastica
model, Euler's elastica model and the total variation model for gray level
images. Compared to our previous color elastica model, the new models are
direct extensions of Euler's elastica model to color images. The proposed
models are nonlinear and challenging to minimize. To overcome this difficulty,
two operator-splitting methods are suggested. Specifically, nonlinearities are
decoupled by introducing new vector- and matrix-valued variables. Then, the
minimization problems are converted to solving initial value problems which are
time-discretized by operator splitting. Each subproblem, after splitting
either, has a closed-form solution or can be solved efficiently. The
effectiveness and advantages of the proposed models are demonstrated by
comprehensive experiments. The benefits of incorporating the elastica of the
image surface as regularization terms compared to common alternatives are
empirically validated.

Our goal is to compare forms of Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting, the

a short review of all methods and illustrate their usage by contrasting the
survival of smokers and non-smokers, using data from the German Epidemiological

Monte-Carlo simulation. We consider scenarios in which correctly or incorrectly
specified models for describing the treatment assignment and the time-to-event

determined by taking the entire survival curve into account. When used
properly, all methods showed no systematic bias in medium to large samples. Cox
regression based methods, however, showed systematic bias in small samples. The
goodness-of-fit varied greatly between different methods and scenarios. Methods
utilizing an outcome model were more efficient than other techniques, while
augmented estimators using an additional treatment assignment model were
unbiased when either model was correct with a goodness-of-fit comparable to
other methods. These doubly-robust methods have important advantages in every

from their birth environment into the Galactic field. They are important for
understanding the star formation process, early stellar evolution, the
properties and distribution of young stars and the processes by which young
stellar groups disperse. Recent observations, particularly from Gaia, have
shown that associations are highly complex, with a high degree of spatial,
kinematic and temporal substructure. The kinematics of associations have shown
them to be globally unbound and expanding, with the majority of recent studies
revealing evidence for clear expansion patterns in the association subgroups,
suggesting the subgroups were more compact in the past. This expansion is often
non-isotropic, arguing against a simple explosive expansion, as predicted by
some models of residual gas expulsion. The star formation histories of
associations are often complex, exhibit moderate age spreads and temporal
substructure, but so far have failed to reveal simple patterns of star
formation propagation (e.g., triggering). These results have challenged the
historical paradigm of the origin of associations as the expanded remnants of
dense star clusters and suggests instead that they originate as highly
substructured systems without a linear star formation history, but with
multiple clumps of stars that have since expanded and begun to overlap,
producing the complex systems we observe today. This has wide-ranging
consequences for the early formation environments of most stars and planetary
systems, including our own Solar System.

segmentation task from existing labeled image datasets to unlabeled events via
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Compared to existing UDA methods, our
approach aligns recurrent, motion-invariant event embeddings with image

hallucinate motion from still images. Additionally, we introduce DSEC-Semantic,

example, those arising in the computation of the critical values of a
polynomial restricted to a variety for polynomial optimisation. Gr\""obner bases
are a classical tool for solving polynomial systems. For practical
computations, this consists of two stages. First, a Gr\""obner basis is computed
with respect to a DRL (degree reverse lexicographic) ordering. Then, a change
of ordering algorithm, such as \textsf{Sparse-FGLM}, designed by Faug\`ere and
Mou, is used to find a Gr\""obner basis of the same ideal but with respect to a
lexicographic ordering. The complexity of this latter step, in terms of
arithmetic operations, is $O(mD^2)$, where $D$ is the degree of the ideal and
$m$ is the number of non-trivial columns of a certain $D \times D$ matrix.
While asymptotic estimates are known for $m$ for generic polynomial systems,
thus far, the complexity of \textsf{Sparse-FGLM} was unknown for determinantal
systems.
  By assuming Fr\""oberg's conjecture we expand the work of Moreno-Soc\'ias by
detailing the structure of the DRL staircase in the determinantal setting. Then
we study the asymptotics of the quantity $m$ by relating it to the coefficients
of these Hilbert series. Consequently, we arrive at a new bound on the
complexity of the \textsf{Sparse-FGLM} algorithm for generic determinantal
systems and for generic critical point systems. We consider the ideal in the
polynomial ring $\mathbb{K}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is some
infinite field, generated by $p$ generic polynomials of degree $d$ and the
maximal minors of a $p \times (n-1)$ polynomial matrix with generic entries of
degree $d-1$. Then for the case $d=2$ and for $n \gg p$ we give an exact
formula for $m$ in terms of $n$ and $p$. Moreover, for $d \geq 3$, we give an
asymptotic formula, as $n \to \infty$, for $m$ in terms of $n,p$ and $d$.

distributions by clustering pixels of each original class into multiple
subclasses of similar sizes, which provide class-balanced pseudo supervision to
regularize the class-biased segmentation. In addition, we design an
entropy-based gate mechanism to coordinate learning between the original
classes and the clustered subclasses which facilitates subclass regularization

in the emergence of unconventional superconductivity. In these strongly
correlated materials, the pairing mechanism is often assumed to be mediated by
magnetic correlations, in contrast to phonon-mediated interactions in
conventional superconductors. A precise understanding of the underlying
mechanism in real materials is, however, still lacking, and has been driving
experimental and theoretical research for the past 40 years. Early theoretical
studies established the emergence of binding among dopants in ladder systems,
where idealised theoretical toy models played an instrumental role in the
elucidation of pairing, despite repulsive interactions. Here, we realise this
long-standing theoretical prediction and report on the observation of hole
pairing due to magnetic correlations in a quantum gas microscope setting. By
engineering doped antiferromagnetic ladders with mixed-dimensional couplings we
suppress Pauli blocking of holes at short length scales. This results in a
drastic increase in binding energy and decrease in pair size, enabling us to
observe pairs of holes predominantly occupying the same rung of the ladder. We
find a hole-hole binding energy on the order of the superexchange energy, and,
upon increased doping, we observe spatial structures in the pair distribution,
indicating repulsion between bound hole pairs. By engineering a configuration
in which binding is strongly enhanced, we delineate a novel strategy to
increase the critical temperature for superconductivity.

However, MCMC can produce a significant computational burden. This motivates us
to consider finding expressions of the posterior distribution that are

We focus on a broad class of Bayesian latent Gaussian process (LGP) models that
allow for spatially dependent data. First, we derive a new class of
distributions we refer to as the generalized conjugate multivariate (GCM)
distribution. The GCM distribution's theoretical development is similar to that
of the CM distribution with two main differences; namely, (1) the GCM allows
for latent Gaussian process assumptions, and (2) the GCM explicitly accounts
for hyperparameters through marginalization. The development of GCM is needed
to obtain independent replicates directly from the exact posterior
distribution, which has an efficient projection/regression form. Hence, we
refer to our method as Exact Posterior Regression (EPR). Illustrative examples
are provided including simulation studies for weakly stationary spatial
processes and spatial basis function expansions. An additional analysis of

tackled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A CNN learns to produce
pixel-level predictions through training on pairs of images and their
corresponding ground-truth segmentation labels. For segmentation tasks with
multiple classes, the standard approach is to use a network that computes a
multi-channel probabilistic segmentation map, with each channel representing
one class. In applications where the image grid size (e.g., when it is a 3D
volume) and/or the number of labels is relatively large, the standard
(baseline) approach can become prohibitively expensive for our computational
resources. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to address
this challenge. In our approach, the segmentation network produces a
single-channel output, while being conditioned on a single class label, which
determines the output class of the network. Our method, called label
conditioned segmentation (LCS), can be used to segment images with a very large
number of classes, which might be infeasible for the baseline approach. We also
demonstrate in the experiments that label conditioning can improve the accuracy
of a given backbone architecture, likely, thanks to its parameter efficiency.
Finally, as we show in our results, an LCS model can produce previously unseen
fine-grained labels during inference time, when only coarse labels were
available during training. We provide all of our code here:

learning capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) has prompted many GNN-based
methods for brain network analysis to be proposed. Specifically, these methods
apply feature aggregation and global pooling to convert brain network instances
into meaningful low-dimensional representations used for downstream brain
network analysis tasks. However, existing GNN-based methods often neglect that
brain networks of different subjects may require various aggregation iterations
and use GNN with a fixed number of layers to learn all brain networks.
Therefore, how to fully release the potential of GNNs to promote brain network
analysis is still non-trivial. To solve this problem, we propose a novel brain
network representation framework, namely BN-GNN, which searches for the optimal
GNN architecture for each brain network. Concretely, BN-GNN employs deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to train a meta-policy to automatically determine
the optimal number of feature aggregations (reflected in the number of GNN
layers) required for a given brain network. Extensive experiments on eight
real-world brain network datasets demonstrate that our proposed BN-GNN improves
the performance of traditional GNNs on different brain network analysis tasks.

This is mainly due to 1) the serious data bias: the normal visual regions
dominate the dataset over the abnormal visual regions, and 2) the very long
sequence. To alleviate above two problems, we propose an AlignTransformer
framework, which includes the Align Hierarchical Attention (AHA) and the
Multi-Grained Transformer (MGT) modules: 1) AHA module first predicts the
disease tags from the input image and then learns the multi-grained visual
features by hierarchically aligning the visual regions and disease tags. The
acquired disease-grounded visual features can better represent the abnormal

generate the long medical report. The experiments on the public IU-Xray and

competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the two datasets. Moreover, the

interesting findings are that the string corrections coincide with the
so-called generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrections to black hole
solutions, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy acquires logarithmic corrections, and
that there exists a critical value of the coupling parameter for which the
black hole temperature vanishes. We also find that, due to the string
corrections the nature of the central singularity may be altered from spacelike
to timelike singularity. In addition, we study the possibility of testing such
a black hole with astrophysical observations. Since the dilaton field does not
decouple from the metric it is not a priori clear that the resulting 4D SCBH
offers only small corrections to the Schwarzschild black hole. We used motion
of the S2 star around the black hole at the center of our galaxy to constrain
the parameters (the string coupling parameter and ADM mass) of the 4D SCBH. To
test the weak gravity regime we calculate the deflection angle in this geometry
and apply it to gravitational lensing. To test the strong field regime, we
calculate the black hole shadow radius. While we find that the observables
change as we change the string coupling parameter, the magnitude of the change
is too small to distinguish it from the Schwarzschild black hole. With the
current precision, to the leading order terms, the 4D SCBH cannot be
distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole.

  A Graph-based Deep Learning Approach",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bike sharing is an increasingly popular part of urban transportation systems.
Accurate demand prediction is the key to support timely re-balancing and ensure
service efficiency. Most existing models of bike-sharing demand prediction are
solely based on its own historical demand variation, essentially regarding bike
sharing as a closed system and neglecting the interaction between different
transport modes. This is particularly important because bike sharing is often
used to complement travel through other modes (e.g., public transit). Despite
some recent efforts, there is no existing method capable of leveraging
spatiotemporal information from multiple modes with heterogeneous spatial
units. To address this research gap, this study proposes a graph-based deep
learning approach for bike sharing demand prediction (B-MRGNN) with multimodal
historical data as input. The spatial dependencies across modes are encoded
with multiple intra- and inter-modal graphs. A multi-relational graph neural
network (MRGNN) is introduced to capture correlations between spatial units
across modes, such as bike sharing stations, subway stations, or ride-hailing
zones. Extensive experiments are conducted using real-world bike sharing,
subway and ride-hailing data from New York City, and the results demonstrate
the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing methods.

spending a significant amount of their time on repetitive tasks, which
introduces errors and can prohibit production of statistically relevant data.
Crystallisation experiments are common in many chemical fields, both for
purification and in polymorph screening experiments. The initial step often
involves a solubility screen of the molecule; that is, understanding whether
molecular compounds have dissolved in a particular solvent. This usually can be
time consuming and work intensive. Moreover, accurate knowledge of the precise
solubility limit of the molecule is often not required, and simply measuring a
threshold of solubility in each solvent would be sufficient. To address this,
we propose a novel cascaded deep model that is inspired by how a human chemist
would visually assess a sample to determine whether the solid has completely

While releasing datasets continues to make a big impact in various applications

datasets in a two-stage process. First, we introduce a global decoupling stage
for decomposing raw data into sensitive and non-sensitive latent
representations. Secondly, we design a local sampling stage to synthetically
generate sensitive information with differential privacy and merge it with
non-sensitive latent features to create a useful representation while
preserving the privacy. This newly formed latent information is a task-agnostic
representation of the original dataset with anonymized sensitive information.
While most algorithms sanitize data in a task-dependent manner, a few
task-agnostic sanitization techniques sanitize data by censoring sensitive
information. In this work, we show that a better privacy-utility trade-off is
achieved if sensitive information can be synthesized privately. We validate the
effectiveness of the sanitizer by outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on

and high reflection. Differ from the tunability through the direct
superposition of two structures with different functionalities, we achieve the
reversible conversion between high reflection and high transmission by
manipulating the interlayer coupling near the interface between the two

when the interlayer spacing is small. Decreasing the interlayer spacing of the
bilayer metasurface leads to stronger interlayer coupling and scattering
suppression of the meta-atom, which results in high transmission. On the
contrary, increasing the spacing leads to weaker interlayer coupling and
scattering enhancement, which results in high reflection. The high transmission
of the bilayer metasurface has good robustness due to that the meta-atom with
interlayer coupling can maintain the scattering suppression against adjacent

performance of advanced models with naive reference methods. On this point, a
rigorous formalism using statistical tools, variational calculation and
quantification of noise in the measurement is studied and five naive reference
forecasting methods are considered, among which there is a newly proposed
approach called ARTU (a particular autoregressive model of order two). These
methods do not require any training phase nor demand any (or almost no)
historical data. Additionally, motivated by the well-known benefits of ensemble
forecasting, a combination of these models is considered, and then validated
using data from multiple sites with diverse climatological characteristics,
based on various error metrics, among which some are rarely used in the field
of solar energy. The most appropriate benchmarking method depends on the
salient features of the variable being forecast (e.g., seasonality, cyclicity,
or conditional heteoroscedasity) as well as the forecast horizon. Hence, to
ensure a fair benchmarking, forecasters should endeavor to discover the most

defined, and its time averaged value is found to have a nonmonotonic

found between the convexity of the downstream dune tip and the initial mass
ratio. The stationary points of the two nonmonotonic curves above correspond to
the same dune interaction pattern named 'exchange-chasing', which is considered

stakeholders in this ecosystem and observers. Web3 and NFTs are a fast-growing
300 billion dollar economy with some clear, highly publicized harms that came
to light recently. We set out to explore the risks to understand their nature
and scope, and if we could find ways to mitigate them. In due course of
investigation, we recap the background of the evolution of the web from a
client-server model to the rise of Web2.0 tech giants in the early 2000s. We
contrast how the Web3 movement is trying to re-establish the independent style
of the early web. In our research we discover a primary set of risks and harms
relevant to the ecosystem, and classify them into a simple taxonomy while
addressing their mitigations with solutions. We arrive at a set of solutions
that are a combination of processes to be adopted, and technological changes or
improvements to be incorporated into the ecosystem, to implement risk
mitigations. By linking mitigations to individual risks, we are confident our
recommendations will improve the security maturity of the growing Web3
ecosystem. We are not endorsing, or recommending specifically any particular
product or service in our solution set. Nor are we compensated or influenced in
any way by these companies to list these products in our research. The
evaluations of products in our research have to simply be viewed as suggested
improvements.

fake audios, photographs, and videos (a.k.a. deepfakes) may have in personal
and societal life? We foresee that the availability of cheap deepfake
technology will create a second wave of disinformation where people will
receive specific, personalized disinformation through different channels,
making the current approaches to fight disinformation obsolete. We argue that
fake media has to be seen as an upcoming cybersecurity problem, and we have to
shift from combating its spread to a prevention and cure framework where users
have available ways to verify, challenge, and argue against the veracity of
each piece of media they are exposed to. To create the technologies behind this
framework, we propose that a new Science of Disinformation is needed, one which
creates a theoretical framework both for the processes of communication and
consumption of false content. Key scientific and technological challenges
facing this research agenda are listed and discussed in the light of
state-of-art technologies for fake media generation and detection, argument
finding and construction, and how to effectively engage users in the prevention
and cure processes.

  Multi-Domain (ISMD) Data Setting for Component-Level Prognostics and Health
  Management (PHM)",,,,,"eess.SP cs.RO cs.SY eess.IV eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the current Industrial 4.0 revolution, Prognostics and Health Management
(PHM) is an emerging field of research. The difficulty of obtaining data from
electromechanical systems in an industrial setting increases proportionally
with the scale and accessibility of the automated industry, resulting in a less
interpolated PHM system. To put it another way, the development of an accurate
PHM system for each industrial system necessitates a unique dataset acquired
under specified conditions. In most circumstances, obtaining this one-of-a-kind
dataset is difficult, and the resulting dataset has a significant imbalance, a
lack of certain useful information, and multi-domain knowledge. To address
this, this paper provides a fault detection and diagnosis system that evaluates
and pre-processes Imbalanced, Scarce, Multi-Domain (ISMD) data acquired from an
industrial robot utilizing Signal Processing (SP) techniques and Deep
Learning-based (DL) domain knowledge transfer. The domain knowledge transfer is
used to produce a synthetic dataset with a high interpolation rate that
contains all the useful information about each domain. For domain knowledge
transfer and data generation, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) with
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) was used, as well as Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) to test the suggested methodology using transfer learning and
categorize several faults. The proposed methodology was tested on a real
experimental bench that included an industrial robot created by Hyundai
Robotics Co. This development resulted in a satisfactory resolution with 99.7%
(highest) classification accuracy achieved by transfer learning on several CNN
benchmark models.

to go beyond classical communication functionality and provide integrated
sensing and communication (ISAC) capability to enable more emerging
applications, such as smart cities, connected vehicles, AIoT and health
care/elder care. Among all the ISAC proposals, the most practical and promising
approach is to empower existing wireless network (e.g., WiFi, 4G/5G) with the
augmented ability to sense the surrounding human and environment, and evolve
wireless communication networks into intelligent communication and sensing
network (e.g., 6G). In this paper, based on our experience on CSI-based
wireless sensing with WiFi/4G/5G signals, we intend to identify ten major
practical and theoretical problems that hinder real deployment of ISAC
applications, and provide possible solutions to those critical challenges.
Hopefully, this work will inspire further research to evolve existing
WiFi/4G/5G networks into next-generation intelligent wireless network (i.e.,
6G).

  technologies to connect supply and demand",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the demand for mobility in our society seems to increase, the various
issues centered on urban mobility are among those that worry most city
inhabitants in this planet. For instance, how to go from A to B in an efficient
(but also less stressful) way? These questions and concerns have not changed
even during the covid-19 pandemic; on the contrary, as the current stand,
people who are avoiding public transportation are only contributing to an
increase in the vehicular traffic. The are of intelligent transportation
systems (ITS) aims at investigating how to employ information and communication
technologies to problems related to transportation. This may mean monitoring
and managing the infrastructure (e.g., traffic roads, traffic signals, etc.).
However, currently, ITS is also targeting the management of demand. In this
panorama, artificial intelligence plays an important role, especially with the
advances in machine learning that translates in the use of computational
vision, connected and autonomous vehicles, agent-based simulation, among
others. In the present work, a survey of several works developed by our group
are discussed in a holistic perspective, i.e., they cover not only the supply
side (as commonly found in ITS works), but also the demand side, and, in an
novel perspective, the integration of both.

published in journals of diverse disciplines. Our analysis focused on analyzing
the nature and composition of literature, finding a large proportion of
articles coming from Mexico and Colombia, as well as specialized in the
economic discipline. The most relevant articles reviewed show methodological
and thematic diversity, with special attention to the problem of growth in
Latin American development. An important limitation of this review is the
exclusion of articles published in Portuguese, as well as non-indexed
literature (such as theses and dissertations). This leads to various
recommendations for future reviews of the development literature produced in
Latin America.
