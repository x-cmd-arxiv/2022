causing visual impairment, proper treatment of which requires identifying
irregularities. This research uses a hemorrhage detection method and compares
classification of conventional and deep features. Especially, method identifies
hemorrhage connected with blood vessels or reside at retinal border and
reported challenging. Initially, adaptive brightness adjustment and contrast
enhancement rectify degraded images. Prospective locations of hemorrhages are
estimated by a Gaussian matched filter, entropy thresholding, and morphological
operation. Hemorrhages are segmented by a novel technique based on regional
variance of intensities. Features are then extracted by conventional methods
and deep models for training support vector machines, and results evaluated.
Evaluation metrics for each model are promising, but findings suggest that
comparatively, deep models are more effective than conventional features.

$s$-wave superconductivity at large negative $U$ with vanishing $V$. The
energies of different particle sectors also help determine the phase separation
region. With carrier doping, charge fluctuation result in strong competition
between different orders, making it more difficult to identify the leading
instability on finite-size cluster. Nevertheless, the more exotic $p$-wave
superconducting pairing is found to be enhanced when the system is heavily
overdoped by $37.5\%-50\%$ holes, especially in interaction parameter range

$LoR$ system provides a secure, user-friendly cooperative environment for an
arbitrarily large number of users who can offer particular services to each
other. The type of services determines the use of the $LoR$ environment. For
example, we might need to create a freelancer; by setting the related services,
we can come up with an instance of $LoR$, which provides those services as a

reliable environment that stands on a (distributed) database as a cooperative
workplace or a service provider system. Such a service provider could be a
freelancer or an IoT management system. The 5G-related services can be
organized to be managed by the $LoR$ system, too.
  The $LoR$ system deals with cooperation rather than transactions. The system
provides reliability and security for the collaborators in each group of
coworkers from the start to the end of a collaboration.
  The benefit of the system comes from randomized techniques and its
well-structured design and policies. These techniques together maintain
consensus and trust for the groups of collaborator parties. The interesting

When naively unifying image-classification and -caption dataset, we show that
such dataset biases negatively affect pre-training by reducing the

this work, we address the problem by disentangling the dataset bias using
prefix tokens that inform a language encoder of the type of the input dataset

the language encoder to share the knowledge from two datasets as well as switch
the mode of feature extraction, i.e., image-classification dataset or

friction can either enhance the axion relic density by delaying the onset of
oscillations or suppress it by damping them. We derive an analytical formula
for the \emph{frictional adiabatic invariant}, which remains constant along the
axion evolution and which allows us to compute the axion relic density in a
general set-up. Even in the most minimal scenario, in which a single gauge
group is responsible for both the generation of the ALP mass and the friction
force, we find that the resulting dark-matter abundance from the misalignment
mechanism deviates from the standard scenario for axion masses $m_a\gtrsim 100
\; {\rm eV}$. We also generalize our analysis to the case where the gauge field
that induces friction and the gauge sector responsible for the ALP mass are
distinct and their couplings to the axion have a large hierarchy as can be
justified by means of alignment or clockwork scenarios. We find that it is easy
to open up the ALP parameter space where the resulting axion abundance matches
the observed dark-matter relic density both in the traditionally over- and
underabundant regimes. This conclusion also holds for the QCD axion.

We provide generalization bounds for learning with this objective through
Rademacher complexity analysis. Then, we focus on the federated setting, where

Most existing federated minimax algorithms either require communication per

Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA), a multiple-local-update descent ascent
algorithm which guarantees convergence under a diminishing stepsize. By
analyzing Local SGDA under the ideal condition of no gradient noise, we show

smooth and strongly-convex-strongly-concave, we prove that FedGDA-GT converges
linearly with a constant stepsize to global $\epsilon$-approximation solution

the time complexity of centralized GDA method. Finally, we numerically show

interactions with quark-gluon plasma droplets created in heavy-ion collisions.
The collective expansion of such droplets is well described by viscous
hydrodynamics. Similar evidence of collectivity is consistently observed in
smaller collision systems, including $pp$ and $p$+Pb collisions. In contrast,
while jet quenching is observed in Pb+Pb collisions, no evidence has been found
in these small systems to date, raising fundamental questions about the nature
of the system created in these collisions. The ATLAS experiment at the Large
Hadron Collider has measured the yield of charged hadrons correlated with
reconstructed jets in 0.36 nb$^{-1}$ of $p$+Pb and 3.6 pb$^{-1}$ of $pp$
collisions at 5.02 TeV. The yields of charged hadrons with
$p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{ch} >0.5$ GeV near and opposite in azimuth to jets with
$p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{jet} > 30$ or 60 GeV, and the ratios of these yields
between $p$+Pb and $pp$ collisions, $I_{p\mathrm{Pb}}$, are reported. The
collision centrality of $p$+Pb events is categorized by the energy deposited by
forward neutrons from the struck nucleus. The $I_{p\mathrm{Pb}}$ values are
consistent with unity within a few percent for hadrons with
$p_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{ch} >4$ GeV at all centralities. These data provide new,
strong constraints which preclude almost any parton energy loss in central
$p$+Pb collisions.

metamaterials whose resulting viscosity is a composite of the thickened,
high-viscosity and dethickened, low viscosity states. Such viscosity
metamaterials can be used to engineer a variety of surprising properties

first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) serve as a promising probe for the new
physics beyond the standard model of particle physics. When most of the bubble
walls collide with each other long after they had reached the terminal wall
velocity, the dominated contribution to the SGWBs comes from the sound waves
characterized by the efficiency factor of inserting the released vacuum energy
into the bulk fluid motions. However, the previous works of estimating this
efficiency factor have only considered the simplified case of the constant
sound velocities in both symmetric and broken phases, either for the bag model
with equal sound velocities or $\nu$-model with different sound velocities in
the symmetric and broken phases, which is unrealistic from a viewpoint of
particle physics. In this paper, we propose to solve the fluid EoM with an
iteration method when taking into account the sound-velocity variation across
the bubble wall for a general and realistic equation of state (EoS) beyond the
simple bag model and $\nu$-model. We have found a suppression effect for the
efficiency factor of bulk fluid motions, though such a suppression effect could
be negligible for the strong FOPT, in which case the previous estimation from a
bag EoS on the efficiency factor of bulk fluid motions still works as a good
approximation.

non-trivial correlations between spacelike-separated measurements. The
phenomenon is referred to as a violation of strong-locality and, after
Einstein, called ghostly action at a distance. An intriguing and previously
unasked question is how the evolution of an assembly of particles to
equilibrium-state relates to strong-locality. More specifically, whether, with
this respect, indistinguishable particles differ from distinguishable ones.
  To address the question, we introduce a Markov-chain based framework over a
finite set of microstates. For the first time, we formulate conditions needed
to obey the particle transport- and strong-locality for indistinguishable
particles.
  Models which obey transport-locality and lead to equilibrium-state are
considered. We show that it is possible to construct models obeying and
violating strong-locality both for indistinguishable particles and for
distinguishable ones. However, we find that only for distinguishable particles
strongly-local evolution to equilibrium is possible without breaking the
microstate-symmetry. This is the strongest symmetry one can impose and leads to
the shortest equilibration time.
  We hope that the results presented here may provide a new perspective on a
violation of strong-locality, and the developed framework will help in future
studies. Specifically they may help to interpret results on high-energy nuclear
collisions indicating a fast equilibration of indistinguishable particles.

structure of gas clumps, to probe the existence of a hierarchical cascade and
to evaluate its possible link with star production in terms of multiplicity.
From the Herschel emission maps of NGC 2264, clumps are extracted using getsf
software at each of their associated spatial resolution, respectively [8.4,
13.5, 18.2, 24.9, 36.3]"". Using the spatial distribution of these clumps and
the class 0/I Young Stellar Object (YSO) from Spitzer data, we develop a
graph-theoretic analysis to represent the multi-scale structure of the cloud as
a connected network. From this network, we derive three classes of multi-scale
structure in NGC 2264 depending on the number of nodes produced at the deepest
level: hierarchical, linear and isolated. The structure class is strongly
correlated with the column density $N_{\rm H_2}$ since the hierarchical ones
dominate the regions whose N$_{\rm H_2} > 6 \times 10^{22}$cm$^{-2}$. Although
the latter are in minority, they contain half of the class 0/I YSOs proving
that they are highly efficient in producing stars. We define a novel
statistical metric, the fractality coefficient F that measure the fractal index
describing the scale-free process of the cascade. For NGC 2264, we estimate F =
1.45$\pm$0.12. However, a single fractal index fails to fully describe a
scale-free process since the hierarchical cascade starts at a 13 kAU
characteristic spatial scale. Our novel methodology allows us to correlate YSOs
with their multi-scale gaseous environment. This hierarchical cascade that
drives efficient star formation is suspected to be both hierarchical and rooted
by the larger-scale gas environment up to 13 kAU.

equations for a free inviscid fluid, the external effects of radiation and the

equations of first order in time. This defines an initial value problem that
can be integrated given the radiation balance of the planet. If the
nonlinearities are neglected, the integration can be done in analytic form
using standard Green function methods, with small nonlinearities incorporated
as perturbative corrections in a consistent way. If the nonlinear approximation
is not justified, the problem can be integrated numerically. The analytic
expressions as well as the simulations of the linear regime for a continuous

response of the model to changes of those parameters. In particular, it is
observed that a 2.5% reduction in the emissivity of the atmosphere can lead to
an increase of 7C degrees in the average global temperature.

is scalable to large graphs by a factorized parametric mixture model of the

that post-quantum cryptography does not have, and PQC can provide secure and
convenient authentication for QKD networks. In this paper, we propose two
protocols based on PQC to realize the full authentication of the QKD data
post-processing, and we only need to assume the short-term security of PQC
algorithm to ensure the long-term quantum resistant security of distributed
keys. We found that for the above two authentication protocols, attackers
cannot successfully implement replay attacks. These authentication protocols
can solve the problems of the current pre-shared key authentication in the

to realize a key distribution mechanism with practical operability and quantum

continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation of stochastic thermodynamics.
These investigations either assumed that there was exactly zero irreversible
entropy production (EP) generated by the physical system implementing the
computation, or allowed the EP to be nonzero but only considered the mismatch
cost component of the EP. In addition, they only applied to a single type of
computer. Our framework neither requires that EP equal zero nor restricts
attention to the mismatch cost component of EP, and is designed to apply to all
types of computational machines. In contrast to earlier investigations using
the CTMC-based formulation, our framework is based on the inclusive Hamiltonian
formulation, in which the combination of the system of interest and the baths
evolve in a Hamiltonian (or unitary) dynamics. Here, we use our framework to
derive an integral fluctuation theorem for computers, in which the expectation
value is strictly less than 1. We also derive an exchange fluctuation theorem,

The most popular algorithms to solve this problem (such as
Expectation-Maximization) have a tendency to stuck at local minima. We provide
a novel invex relaxation for this intractable problem which leads to a solution
with provable theoretical guarantees. This relaxation enables exact recovery of
data labels. Furthermore, we recover a close approximation of the regression
parameter vectors which match the true parameter vectors in support and sign.
Our formulation uses a carefully constructed primal dual witnesses framework

ViT-based models are generally times slower than lightweight convolutional

the inference speed is still unsatisfactory. This leads to an important

performance? To answer this, we first revisit the network architecture and
operators used in ViT-based models and identify inefficient designs. Then we
introduce a dimension-consistent pure transformer (without MobileNet blocks) as
a design paradigm. Finally, we perform latency-driven slimming to get a series

  reconciling bulk locality with general covariance","90+13 pages. Comments welcome and appreciated",,,,"hep-th gr-qc quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe a completely general and fully non-perturbative framework for
constructing dynamical reference frames in generally covariant theories, and
for understanding the gauge-invariant observables that they yield. Our approach
makes use of a 'universal dressing space', which contains as a subset every
possible dynamical frame. We describe examples of such frames, including matter
frames, a popular construction based on boundary-anchored geodesics and one
using minimal surfaces -- but our formalism does not depend on the existence of
a boundary. The class of observables we construct generalises and unifies the
dressed and relational approaches to constructing gravitational observables,
including single-integral and canonical power-series constructions. All these
(possibly gravitationally charged) relational observables describe physics in a
precise sense relative to the dynamical frame and respect a notion of
'relational' locality based on the relationships between fields. By using
'relational atlases', i.e. collections of dynamical frames glued together by
field-dependent maps (which are relational observables too), we can construct
relationally local observables throughout spacetime. This further establishes a
framework for dynamical frame covariance that permits us to change between
arbitrary relational frame perspectives. Relational locality obeys many
desirable properties: we prove that it satisfies microcausality in the bulk (in
tension with previous work done mainly in a perturbative setting which we
comment on), and show that it permits a relational version of local bulk
dynamics. Relational locality is therefore arguably more physically meaningful
than the ordinary notion of locality. Thus, our formalism -- which we argue to
be an updated, gauge-invariant version of general covariance -- refutes the
commonly claimed non-existence of local gravitational bulk physics.

questions of galaxy evolution. Successful cosmological models of galaxy
evolution require a fraction of energy released by an AGN to be redistributed
into the interstellar medium to reproduce the observed stellar mass and
luminosity function and to prevent the formation of over-massive galaxies.
Observations have confirmed that the radio-AGN population is energetically
capable of heating and redistributing gas at all phases, however, direct
evidence of AGN enhancing or quenching star formation remains rare. With
modern, deep radio surveys and large integral field spectroscopy (IFS) surveys,
we can detect fainter synchrotron emission from AGN jets and accurately probe
the star-forming properties of galaxies, respectively. In this paper, we
combine data from the LOw Frequency ARray Two-meter Sky Survey with data from
one of the largest optical IFS surveys, Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point
Observatory to probe the star-forming properties of 307 local (z $<$ 0.15)
galaxies that host radio-detected AGN (RDAGN). We compare our results to a
robust control sample of non-active galaxies that each match the stellar mass,
redshift, visual morphology, and inclination of a RDAGN host. We find that
RDAGN and control galaxies have broad SFR distributions, typically lie below
the star-forming main-sequence, and have negative stellar light-weighted age
gradients. These results indicate that AGN selected based on their current
activity are not responsible for suppressing their host galaxies' star
formation. Rather, our results support the maintenance mode role that radio AGN
are expected to have in the local Universe.

way can significantly improve the performance. While visual representation is
extensively studied in traditional VQA, it is under-explored in knowledge-based
VQA even though these two tasks share the common spirit, i.e., rely on visual
input to answer the question. Specifically, we observe that in most
state-of-the-art knowledge-based VQA methods: 1) visual features are extracted
either from the whole image or in a sliding window manner for retrieving
knowledge, and the important relationship within/among object regions is
neglected; 2) visual features are not well utilized in the final answering
model, which is counter-intuitive to some extent. Based on these observations,
we propose a new knowledge-based VQA method REVIVE, which tries to utilize the
explicit information of object regions not only in the knowledge retrieval
stage but also in the answering model. The key motivation is that object
regions and inherent relationship are important for knowledge-based VQA. We
perform extensive experiments on the standard OK-VQA dataset and achieve new

Indeed, we show that it is possible to train dense segmentation models using

variety of downstream vision tasks. Two main-stream SSL frameworks have been
proposed, i.e., Instance Discrimination (ID) and Masked Image Modeling (MIM).
ID pulls together representations from different views of the same image, while
avoiding feature collapse. It lacks spatial sensitivity, which requires
modeling the local structure within each image. On the other hand, MIM
reconstructs the original content given a masked image. It instead does not
have good semantic alignment, which requires projecting semantically similar
views into nearby representations. To address this dilemma, we observe that (1)
semantic alignment can be achieved by matching different image views with
strong augmentations; (2) spatial sensitivity can benefit from predicting dense
representations with masked images. Driven by these analysis, we propose
Siamese Image Modeling (SiameseIM), which predicts the dense representations of
an augmented view, based on another masked view from the same image but with
different augmentations. SiameseIM uses a Siamese network with two branches.
The online branch encodes the first view, and predicts the second view's
representation according to the relative positions between these two views. The
target branch produces the target by encoding the second view. SiameseIM can
surpass both ID and MIM on a wide range of downstream tasks, including ImageNet

Specifically, we focus on electronic states energetically proximate to Van Hove
singularities (VHSs), where a large density of states promotes different
interaction-induced symmetry-breaking electronic orders. To resolve the Fermi
surface near VHSs, we construct a fermionic hot-spot model and demonstrate that
a perpendicular electric field can tune different nesting structures of the
Fermi surface. Subsequently, we apply a renormalization group analysis to
describe the low-energy phase diagrams of our model under both short-range
repulsive interactions as well as realistic (long-range) Coulomb interactions.
Our analysis shows instabilities towards either intervalley coherent metallic
phases or superconducting phases. The dominant pairing channel depends
crucially on the nature of Fermi surface nesting -- repulsive Coulomb
interaction favors spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing for relatively small
displacement field and spin-singlet $i$-wave pairing for larger displacement
field. We argue that the phase diagram of RTG can be well-understood by
modeling the realistic Coulomb interaction as the sum of repulsive
density-density interaction and ferromagnetic spin-triplet intervalley
coherence (IVC) Hund's coupling, while phonon-mediated electronic interactions
have a negligible effect on this system, in sharp contrast to twisted graphene

of temperatures. We obtain a refined Planckian dissipation picture where the
scattering time $\tau \approx f\cdot \hbar/(k_B T)$ with $f$ almost independent
of all model parameters except for the overall strength of the two couplings
when their ratio is optimal. We find $f \approx 1$ when the couplings take
maximal value for which strange metallic behavior is exhibited. However,
$f\approx \mathcal{O}(10)$ when the couplings are smaller. Although not
derivable from quasi-particles, our results at optimal doping fit a Drude-type
phenomenology with Planckian scattering time, and an almost model-independent
$n/m$, which is about $2\pi$ times the Fermi liquid value at same $E_F$.

kinematic substructures, which are possibly signatures of the bar and spiral
arms of the Milky Way and of previous accretion events. These kinematic
substructures -- moving groups -- can be thought of as continuous manifolds in
the 6D phase space, and the ridges in the $V_{\phi}-R$ and arches in the
$V_\phi-V_R$ plane, discovered with the Gaia mission, as projections of these
manifolds. We develop and apply a methodology to perform a blind search for
substructure in the Gaia EDR3 6D data, and obtain a sampling of the manifolds.
The method consists in the execution of the Wavelet Transform in small volumes
of the Milky Way disc, and the grouping of these local solutions into global
ones with a method based on the Breadth-first search algorithm from Graph
Theory. We reveal the complex skeleton of the velocity distribution, sampling
nine main moving groups in a large region of the disc ($6$ kpc, $60$ deg, and
$2$ kpc in the radial, azimuthal, and vertical directions). In the radial
direction, the groups deviate from lines of constant angular momentum that one
would naively expect from first order effect of resonances. The azimuthal
velocity of Acturus, Bobylev, and Hercules is non-axisymmetric. For Hercules,
we measure an azimuthal gradient of $-0.50$ km/s/deg at $R=8$ kpc. We detect a
vertical asymmetry in the azimuthal velocity for Coma Berenices, which is not
expected in a resonance of the bar, supporting previous hypothesis of
incomplete vertical phase-mixing. When we apply the same methodology to
simulations of barred galaxies, we extract substructures corresponding to the
Outer Linbdlad and the 1:1 Resonances and observe patterns consistent with the
data. This data-driven characterization allows for a quantitative comparison
with models, providing a key tool to comprehend the dynamics of the Milky Way.

showing clear signs of strong gravitational lensing. Some studies call for a
missing population of lensed high-$z$ quasars, but their existence is still in
doubt. A large fraction of high-$z$ quasars being lensed would have a
significant effect on the shape of the intrinsic quasar luminosity function
(QLF). Here, we perform the first systematic search for lensed X-ray-detected
quasars at $z \gtrsim 6$ employing a Bayesian analysis, with the code BAYMAX,
to look for morphological evidence of multiple images that may escape a visual
inspection. We analyzed a sample of 22 quasars at $z > 5.8$ imaged by the
Chandra X-ray observatory and found none with statistically significant
multiple images. In the sub-sample of the 8 sources with photon counts $>20$ we
exclude multiple images with separations $r>1''$ and count ratios $f>0.4$, or
with separations as small as $0.''7$ and $f>0.7$ at $95\%$ confidence level.
Comparing this non-detection with predictions from theoretical models
suggesting a high and a low lensed fraction, we placed upper limits on the
bright-end slope, $\beta$, of the QLF. Using only the sub-sample with 8
sources, we obtain, in the high-lensing model, a limit $\beta < 3.38$. Assuming
no multiple source is present in the full sample of 22 sources, we obtain
$\beta < 2.89$ and $\beta < 3.53$ in the high and low lensing models,
respectively. These constraints strongly disfavor steep QLF shapes previously
proposed in the literature.

to explain Li detection in $\sim$30\% of the observed RSGs, we speculate that
some stochasticity and a scenario where Li was not completely destroyed in the

ranging from ~1000-2000A, derived from a combination of archival and new data
obtained with HST's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). This paper details the
multi-stage technical processes of creating this prime data product, and the

calibration offsets can affect the derived properties of the stellar
populations, while customized extractions of NUV spectra for extended sources
are essential for correctly diagnosing the metallicity of galaxies via CIII]
nebular emission. Despite changes in spectral resolution of up to ~25% between
individual datasets (due to changes in the COS line spread function), no

identify an inner product and canonically conjugate position and momentum
operators defined in the rest space of the trajectory for each value of its
proper time. This framework then naturally provides a recipe for mapping a
quantum theory defined in a non-relativistic background to a theory around a
timelike trajectory in curved spacetimes. This is done by reinterpreting the
position and momentum operators and by introducing a local redshift factor to
the Hamiltonian, which gives rise to new dynamics due to the curvature of
spacetime and the acceleration of the trajectory. We then apply our formalism
to particle detector models, that is, to the case where the non-relativistic
quantum system is coupled to a quantum field in a curved background. This
allows one to write a general definition for particle detector models which is
able to recover the previous models in the literature. Our framework also
allows one to estimate the regime of validity of these models, characterizing
the situations where particle detectors can be used to accurately probe quantum

defined as parallel and perpendicular to the star-forming locus on the BPT
diagram based on the Kauffmann et al. and Schawinski et al. criteria. For
parallel subsamples we find that AGN host properties exhibit a morphological
evolution as they become more distant to the star-forming sequence. The local
density environment shows a more evident morphology-density relationship for
subsamples mainly formed by Composite and Spiral galaxies than those containing
LINERs and Seyferts, where the AGN emission is the dominant source. We also
analyse the properties of the five closest AGN neighbours observing no
significant differences in the environment, although the AGN host properties of
every subsample have noticeable variations. The AGNs belonging to perpendicular
subsamples show clear differences on their host properties from left top to
right bottom on the diagram. However, the analysis of the local density
environment do not reflect strong dependency with the host AGN properties. This
result is reinforced by the characteristics of the AGN neighbouring galaxies.
These findings suggest that mixed AGN/star-forming galaxies present
environmental features more similar to that of non-active galaxies. However, as
AGNs at the centre of the more evolved galaxies become the dominant source, the
environment tends to provide suitable conditions for the central black hole

We show that DDQ is stronger, more robust, and converges faster. It obtains
44.5 AP on the MS COCO detection dataset with only 12 epochs. DDQ is also
robust as it outperforms previous methods on both object detection and instance
segmentation tasks on various datasets. DDQ blends advantages from traditional
dense priors and recent end-to-end detectors. We hope it can serve as a new

evolution of a bicrystal metal precursor made of model elements 'A' and 'B,' in
contact with a liquid dealloying agent of species 'C.' The model assumes that
'A' is immiscible with 'C,' which leads to the selective dissolution of 'B'
from the precursor. Spinodal driving forces and surface diffusion within the
solid-liquid interface cause 'A' to segregate, initiating the growth of
'A'-rich solid ligaments and promoting the bicontinuous penetration of the
dealloying agent 'C' into the precursor. We demonstrate that this dealloying
process leads to coupled grain-boundary migration to maintain equilibrium
contact angles with this topologically-complex solid-liquid interface. This
leads to dealloying being locally accelerated by dissolving 'B' from (and
rejecting 'A' into) the grain boundary. The migrating grain boundary promotes
formation of a locally deeper corrosion channel that asymmetrically disrupts
the ligament connectivity of the final dealloyed structure, in qualitative
agreement with published experimental observations. The influence of varying
grain boundary properties is explored within the model, showing that, in a
polycrystalline sample, corrosion will be significantly deeper at the grain
boundaries with large mobilities and fast solute diffusivities.

velocity space with appropriately chosen and explicitly given Raviart--Thomas
bubbles. This approach is inspired by [Li/Rui, IMA J. Numer. Anal, 2021], where
the case $k=1$ was studied. The proposed method is pressure-robust, with
optimally converging $\boldsymbol{H}^1$-conforming velocity and a small
$\boldsymbol{H}(\mathrm{div})$-conforming correction rendering the full

method is parameter-free. Furthermore, it is shown that the additional degrees

In the overparameterized regime in neural networks, there exist many low-loss
solutions that fit the training data equally well. The key question is which
solution is more generalizable. Empirical studies showed a strong correlation
between flatness of the loss landscape at a solution and its generalizability,
and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is crucial in finding the flat solutions.
To understand how SGD drives the learning system to flat solutions, we
construct a simple model whose loss landscape has a continuous set of
degenerate (or near degenerate) minima. By solving the Fokker-Planck equation
of the underlying stochastic learning dynamics, we show that due to its strong
anisotropy the SGD noise introduces an additional effective loss term that
decreases with flatness and has an overall strength that increases with the
learning rate and batch-to-batch variation. We find that the additional
landscape-dependent SGD-loss breaks the degeneracy and serves as an effective
regularization for finding flat solutions. Furthermore, a stronger SGD noise
shortens the convergence time to the flat solutions. However, we identify an
upper bound for the SGD noise beyond which the system fails to converge. Our
results not only elucidate the role of SGD for generalization they may also
have important implications for hyperparameter selection for learning
efficiently without divergence.

common foundational goal among methods. For example, some methods are motivated
by function approximation, some by game theoretic notions, and some by
obtaining clean visualizations. This fragmentation of goals causes not only an
inconsistent conceptual understanding of explanations but also the practical
challenge of not knowing which method to use when.
  In this work, we begin to address these challenges by unifying eight popular
post hoc explanation methods (LIME, C-LIME, KernelSHAP, Occlusion, Vanilla
Gradients, Gradients x Input, SmoothGrad, and Integrated Gradients). We show
that these methods all perform local function approximation of the black-box
model, differing only in the neighbourhood and loss function used to perform
the approximation. This unification enables us to (1) state a no free lunch
theorem for explanation methods, demonstrating that no method can perform
optimally across all neighbourhoods, and (2) provide a guiding principle to
choose among methods based on faithfulness to the black-box model. We
empirically validate these theoretical results using various real-world
datasets, model classes, and prediction tasks.
  By bringing diverse explanation methods into a common framework, this work
(1) advances the conceptual understanding of these methods, revealing their
shared local function approximation objective, properties, and relation to one
another, and (2) guides the use of these methods in practice, providing a
principled approach to choose among methods and paving the way for the creation

  equations with periodic boundary conditions","34 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.LG cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  High-dimensional Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are a popular
mathematical modelling tool, with applications ranging from finance to
computational chemistry. However, standard numerical techniques for solving
these PDEs are typically affected by the curse of dimensionality. In this work,
we tackle this challenge while focusing on stationary diffusion equations
defined over a high-dimensional domain with periodic boundary conditions.
Inspired by recent progress in sparse function approximation in high
dimensions, we propose a new method called compressive Fourier collocation.
Combining ideas from compressive sensing and spectral collocation, our method
replaces the use of structured collocation grids with Monte Carlo sampling and
employs sparse recovery techniques, such as orthogonal matching pursuit and
$\ell^1$ minimization, to approximate the Fourier coefficients of the PDE
solution. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that the
approximation error of the proposed method is comparable with the best $s$-term
approximation (with respect to the Fourier basis) to the solution. Using the
recently introduced framework of random sampling in bounded Riesz systems, our
analysis shows that the compressive Fourier collocation method mitigates the
curse of dimensionality with respect to the number of collocation points under
sufficient conditions on the regularity of the diffusion coefficient. We also
present numerical experiments that illustrate the accuracy and stability of the
method for the approximation of sparse and compressible solutions.

3D object detection. More specifically, we extend the 3D position embedding (3D
PE) in PETR for temporal modeling. The 3D PE achieves the temporal alignment on
object position of different frames. A feature-guided position encoder is
further introduced to improve the data adaptability of 3D PE. To support for
multi-task learning (e.g., BEV segmentation and 3D lane detection), PETRv2
provides a simple yet effective solution by introducing task-specific queries,
which are initialized under different spaces. PETRv2 achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 3D object detection, BEV segmentation and 3D lane detection.

can help generalization while orthogonal mappings hurt performance. For
recurrent networks, orthogonal residual mappings form an inductive bias for
time-variant sequences, which degrades accuracy on time-invariant tasks.

vortex structures become susceptible to inviscid secondary instabilities
resulting in early transition to turbulence via `bursting' processes. In
high-speed boundary layers, more complications arise due to compressibility and
thermal effects, which become more significant for higher Mach numbers. In this
paper, we study G\""{o}rtler vortices developing in high-speed boundary layers
using the boundary region equations (BRE) formalism, which we solve using an
efficient numerical algorithm. Streaks are excited using a small transpiration
velocity at the wall. Our BRE-based algorithm is found to be superior to direct
numerical simulation (DNS) and ad-hoc nonlinear parabolized stability equation
(PSE) models. BRE solutions are less computationally costly than a full DNS and
have a more rigorous theoretical foundation than PSE-based models. For example,
the full development of a G\""{o}rtler vortex system in high-speed boundary
layers can be predicted in a matter of minutes using a single processor via the
BRE approach. This substantial reduction in calculation time is one of the
major achievements of this work. We show, among other things, that it allows

magnetic fields known in the universe. The origin of their magnetic field is
still a challenging question. In situ magnetic field amplification by dynamo
action is a promising process to generate ultra-strong magnetic fields in
fast-rotating progenitors. However, it is unclear whether the fraction of
progenitors harboring fast core rotation is sufficient to explain the entire
magnetar population. To address this point, we propose a new scenario for
magnetar formation, in which a slow-rotating proto-neutron star is spun up by
the supernova fallback. We argue that this can trigger the development of the
Tayler-Spruit dynamo while other dynamo processes are disfavored. Using
previous works done on this dynamo and simulations to characterize the
fallback, we derive equations modelling the coupled evolution of the
proto-neutron star rotation and magnetic field. Their time integration for
different fallback masses is successfully compared with analytical estimates of
the amplification timescales and saturation value of the magnetic field. We
find that the magnetic field is amplified within $20$ to $40$s after the core
bounce, and that the radial magnetic field saturates at intensities
$10^{14}-10^{15}$G, therefore spanning the full range of magnetar's dipolar
magnetic fields. We also compare predictions of two proposed saturation
mechanisms showing that magnetar-like magnetic fields can be generated for
neutron star spun up to rotation periods $\lesssim8$ms and $\lesssim28$ms,
corresponding to fallback masses $\gtrsim4\times10^{-2}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ and
$\gtrsim10^{-2}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Thus, our results suggest that magnetars can
be formed from slow-rotating progenitors for fallback masses compatible with
recent supernova simulations and leading to plausible initial rotation periods
of the proto-neutron star.

  In the vertex arrival version of the problem, the goal is to find an
approximate max-weight matching of a given bipartite graph when the vertices in
one part of the graph arrive online in a fixed order with independent chances
of failure. Whenever a vertex arrives we should decide, irrevocably, whether to
match it with one of its unmatched neighbors or leave it unmatched forever.
There has been a long line of work designing approximation algorithms for
different variants of this problem with respect to the offline benchmark
(prophet). Papadimitriou et al., however, propose the alternative online
benchmark and show that considering this new benchmark allows them to improve
the 0.5 approximation ratio, which is the best ratio achievable with respect to
the offline benchmark. They provide a 0.51-approximation algorithm which was
later improved to 0.526 by Saberi and Wajc [ICALP'21]. The main contribution of
this paper is designing a simple algorithm with a significantly improved
approximation ratio of (1-1/e) for this problem.

edges of the graph arrive in an online fashion with independent chances of
failure. Designing approximation algorithms for this problem has also been
studied extensively with the best approximation ratio being 0.337 with respect
to the offline benchmark. This paper, however, is the first to consider the
online benchmark for the edge arrival version of the problem. For this problem,
we provide a simple algorithm with an approximation ratio of 0.5 with respect

problems, but the precise characterization of quantum systems itself remains a
challenge. To address this obstacle, novel tomography schemes have been
developed that employ generative machine learning models, enabling quantum
state reconstruction from limited classical data. In particular,
quantum-inspired Born machines provide a natural way to encode measured data
into a model of a quantum state. Born machines have shown great success in
learning from classical data; however, the full potential of a Born machine in
learning from quantum measurement has thus far been unrealized. To this end, we
devise a complex-valued basis-enhanced Born machine and show that it can
reconstruct pure quantum states using projective measurements from only two
Pauli measurement bases. We implement the basis-enhanced Born machine to learn
the ground states across the phase diagram of a 1D chain of Rydberg atoms,
reconstructing quantum states deep in ordered phases and even at critical
points with quantum fidelities surpassing 99%. The model accurately predicts
quantum correlations and different observables, and system sizes as large as 37
qubits are considered. Quantum states across the phase diagram of a 1D XY spin
chain are also successfully reconstructed using this scheme. Our method only
requires simple Pauli measurements with a sample complexity that scales
quadratically with system size, making it amenable to experimental
implementation.

  Least Squares","50 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Recent studies have shown that heavy tails can emerge in stochastic
optimization and that the heaviness of the tails have links to the
generalization error. While these studies have shed light on interesting
aspects of the generalization behavior in modern settings, they relied on
strong topological and statistical regularity assumptions, which are hard to
verify in practice. Furthermore, it has been empirically illustrated that the
relation between heavy tails and generalization might not always be monotonic
in practice, contrary to the conclusions of existing theory. In this study, we
establish novel links between the tail behavior and generalization properties
of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), through the lens of algorithmic
stability. We consider a quadratic optimization problem and use a heavy-tailed
stochastic differential equation (and its Euler discretization) as a proxy for
modeling the heavy-tailed behavior emerging in SGD. We then prove uniform
stability bounds, which reveal the following outcomes: (i) Without making any
exotic assumptions, we show that SGD will not be stable if the stability is
measured with the squared-loss $x\mapsto x^2$, whereas it in turn becomes
stable if the stability is instead measured with a surrogate loss $x\mapsto
|x|^p$ with some $p<2$. (ii) Depending on the variance of the data, there
exists a \emph{`threshold of heavy-tailedness'} such that the generalization
error decreases as the tails become heavier, as long as the tails are lighter
than this threshold. This suggests that the relation between heavy tails and
generalization is not globally monotonic. (iii) We prove matching lower-bounds
on uniform stability, implying that our bounds are tight in terms of the
heaviness of the tails. We support our theory with synthetic and real neural
network experiments.

four extremal and periodic Gibbs measures in which the rotational symmetry of
the lattice is broken while the translational symmetry is only broken along a
single axis. We further quantify the decay of correlations in these measures,
obtaining a slow rate of exponential decay in the direction of preserved

hold at step 0, i.e. random initialization. In this work, we seek to understand
how this early phase of pre-training leads to a good initialization for IMP
both through the lens of the data distribution and the loss landscape geometry.
Empirically we observe that, holding the number of pre-training iterations
constant, training on a small fraction of (randomly chosen) data suffices to
obtain an equally good initialization for IMP. We additionally observe that by
pre-training only on ""easy"" training data, we can decrease the number of steps
necessary to find a good initialization for IMP compared to training on the
full dataset or a randomly chosen subset. Finally, we identify novel properties
of the loss landscape of dense networks that are predictive of IMP performance,
showing in particular that more examples being linearly mode connected in the
dense network correlates well with good initializations for IMP. Combined,
these results provide new insight into the role played by the early phase

treewidth of the input's incidence graph. While MAX-SAT is fixed-parameter
tractable for all of these parameters, we show that they allow different

remains the subject of ongoing research. Among recent developments, heuristic
approaches to parametric testing have been proposed whose distributional
assumptions are based on empirical evidence. Other formal tests under
regularity conditions were derived analytically. However, these approaches can
be computationally expensive or even practically infeasible. This problem also
occurs with non-parametric permutation tests, which are, however,
distribution-free and can generically be applied to any type of RF and VIMP.
Embracing this advantage, it is proposed here to use sequential permutation
tests and sequential p-value estimation to reduce the high computational costs
associated with conventional permutation tests. The popular and widely used
permutation VIMP serves as a practical and relevant application example. The
results of simulation studies confirm that the theoretical properties of the
sequential tests apply, that is, the type-I error probability is controlled at
a nominal level and a high power is maintained with considerably fewer
permutations needed in comparison to conventional permutation testing. The
numerical stability of the methods is investigated in two additional
application studies. In summary, theoretically sound sequential permutation
testing of VIMP is possible at greatly reduced computational costs.
Recommendations for application are given. A respective implementation is
provided through the accompanying R package $rfvimptest$. The approach can also
be easily applied to any kind of prediction model.

routing by swap insertion. This optimization problem arises in the context of
compiling quantum algorithms onto specific quantum hardware. Our approach
decomposes the routing problem into an allocation subproblem and a set of token
swapping problems. This allows us to tackle the allocation part and the token
swapping part separately. Extracting the allocation part from the qubit routing
model of Nannicini et al. (arXiv:2106.06446), we formulate the allocation
subproblem as a binary program. Herein, we employ a cost function that is a
lower bound on the overall routing problem objective. We strengthen the linear
relaxation by novel valid inequalities. For the token swapping part we develop
an exact branch-and-bound algorithm. In this context, we improve upon known
lower bounds on the token swapping problem. Furthermore, we enhance an existing
approximation algorithm. We present numerical results for the integrated
allocation and token swapping problem. Obtained solutions may not be globally
optimal due to the decomposition and the usage of an approximation algorithm.
However, the solutions are obtained fast and are typically close to optimal. In
addition, there is a significant reduction in the number of gates and output
circuit depth when compared to state-of-the-art heuristics. Reducing these
figures is crucial for minimizing noise when running quantum algorithms on
near-term hardware. As a consequence, using the novel decomposition approach
leads to compiled algorithms with improved quality. Indeed, when compiled with

indistinguishable performances assign conflicting predictions to individual

predictive multiplicity may result in unjustified and arbitrary decisions for
specific individuals. We introduce a new metric, called Rashomon Capacity, to
measure predictive multiplicity in probabilistic classification. Prior metrics
for predictive multiplicity focus on classifiers that output thresholded (i.e.,
0-1) predicted classes. In contrast, Rashomon Capacity applies to probabilistic
classifiers, capturing more nuanced score variations for individual samples. We
provide a rigorous derivation for Rashomon Capacity, argue its intuitive
appeal, and demonstrate how to estimate it in practice. We show that Rashomon
Capacity yields principled strategies for disclosing conflicting models to

captures predictive multiplicity in various datasets and learning models,
including neural networks. The tools introduced in this paper can help data
scientists measure and report predictive multiplicity prior to model

extremely challenging. In [18], Elgindi proved that the 3D axisymmetric Euler
equations with no swirl and $C^{1,\alpha}$ initial velocity develops a finite
time singularity. Inspired by Elgindi's work, we proved that the 3D
axisymmetric Euler and 2D Boussinesq equations with $C^{1,\alpha}$ initial
velocity and boundary develop a stable asymptotically (or approximately)
self-similar finite time singularity [8]. On the other hand, the authors of
[35,52] recently showed that blowup solutions to the 3D Euler equations are
hydrodynamically unstable. The instability results obtained in [35,52] require
some strong regularity assumption on the initial data, which is not satisfied
by the $C^{1,\alpha}$ velocity field. In this paper, we generalize the analysis
of [8,18,35,52] to show that the blowup solutions of the 3D Euler and 2D
Boussinesq equations with $C^{1,\alpha}$ velocity are unstable under the notion
of stability introduced in [35,52]. These two seemingly contradictory results
reflect the difference of the two approaches in studying the stability of 3D
Euler blowup solutions. The stability analysis of the blowup solution obtained
in [8,18] is based on the stability of a dynamically rescaled blowup profile in
space and time, which is nonlinear in nature. The linear stability analysis in
[35,52] is performed by directly linearizing the 3D Euler equations around a
blowup solution in the original variables. It does not take into account the
changes in the blowup time, the dynamic changes of the rescaling rate of the
perturbed blowup profile and the blowup exponent of the original 3D Euler
equations using a perturbed initial condition when there is an approximate
self-similar blowup profile. Such information has been used in an essential way
in establishing the nonlinear stability of the blowup profile in [8,18,19].

We adopt lightweight CNN structures, we perform training as part of the

bitstream. The newly proposed encoding scheme operates on the octree
representation for each point cloud, encoding consecutively each octree
resolution layer. At every octree resolution layer, the voxel grid is traversed
section-by-section (each section being perpendicular to a selected coordinate
axis) and in each section the occupancies of groups of two-by-two voxels are
encoded at once, in a single arithmetic coding operation. A context for the
conditional encoding distribution is defined for each two-by-two group of
voxels, based on the information available about the occupancy of neighbor
voxels in the current and lower resolution layers of the octree. The CNN
estimates the probability distributions of occupancy patterns of all voxel
groups from one section in four phases. In each new phase the contexts are
updated with the occupancies encoded in the previous phase, and each phase
estimates the probabilities in parallel, providing a reasonable trade-off
between the parallelism of processing and the informativeness of the contexts.
The CNN training time is comparable to the time spent in the remaining encoding
steps, leading to competitive overall encoding times. Bitrates and
encoding-decoding times compare favorably with those of recently published
compression schemes.

statements: ""music flows"", and ""music is life-like"". This dissertation builds
on top of the two statements above, resulting in an exploration of the role of
temporal asymmetry in music (generalizing ""music flows"") and its relation to
the idea of organicism (generalizing ""music is life-like""). We focus on two
aspects of temporal asymmetry. The first aspect concerns the vastly different
epistemic mechanisms with which we obtain knowledge of the past and the future.
A particular musical consequence follows: recurrence. The epistemic difference
between the past and the future shapes our experience and interpretation of
recurring events in music. The second aspect concerns the arrow of time: the
unambiguous ordering imposed on temporal events gives rise to the a priori
pointedness of time, rendering time asymmetrical and irreversible. A discussion
on thermodynamics informs us musically: the arrow of time effectuates itself in
musical forms by delaying the placement of the climax.
  Organicism serves as a mediating topic, engaging with the concept of life as
in organisms. On the one hand, organicism is related to temporal asymmetry in
science via a thermodynamical interpretation of life as entropy-reducing
entities. On the other hand, organicism is a topic native to music via the
universally acknowledged artistic idea that music should be interpreted as a
vital force possessing volitional power. With organicism as a mediator, we
better understand the role of temporal asymmetry in music. In particular, we
view musical form as a process of expansion and elaboration analogous to
organic growth. Finally, we present an organicist interpretation of delaying
the climax: viewing musical form as the result of organic growth, the arrow of
time translates to a preference for prepending structure over appending
structure.

excellent performance in biomedical image segmentation, producing high quality
probability maps to allow extraction of rich instance information to facilitate
good instance segmentation. While numerous efforts were put into developing new
DL semantic segmentation models, less attention was paid to a key issue of how
to effectively explore their probability maps to attain the best possible
instance segmentation. We observe that probability maps by DL semantic
segmentation models can be used to generate many possible instance candidates,
and accurate instance segmentation can be achieved by selecting from them a set
of ""optimized"" candidates as output instances. Further, the generated instance
candidates form a well-behaved hierarchical structure (a forest), which allows
selecting instances in an optimized manner. Hence, we propose a novel
framework, called hierarchical earth mover's distance (H-EMD), for instance
segmentation in biomedical 2D+time videos and 3D images, which judiciously
incorporates consistent instance selection with semantic-segmentation-generated
probability maps. H-EMD contains two main stages. (1) Instance candidate
generation: capturing instance-structured information in probability maps by
generating many instance candidates in a forest structure. (2) Instance
candidate selection: selecting instances from the candidate set for final
instance segmentation. We formulate a key instance selection problem on the
instance candidate forest as an optimization problem based on the earth mover's
distance (EMD), and solve it by integer linear programming. Extensive
experiments on eight biomedical video or 3D datasets demonstrate that H-EMD
consistently boosts DL semantic segmentation models and is highly competitive

situation becomes critical when dealing with low-dimensional clustered
datasets, where the time required to sample ergodically the trained models
becomes computationally prohibitive. In this work, we show that this divergence
of Monte Carlo mixing times is related to a phenomenon of phase coexistence,
similar to that which occurs in physics near a first-order phase transition. We
show that sampling the equilibrium distribution using the Markov chain Monte
Carlo method can be dramatically accelerated when using biased sampling
techniques, in particular the Tethered Monte Carlo (TMC) method. This sampling
technique efficiently solves the problem of evaluating the quality of a given
trained model and generating new samples in a reasonable amount of time.
Moreover, we show that this sampling technique can also be used to improve the
computation of the log-likelihood gradient during training, leading to dramatic
improvements in training RBMs with artificial clustered datasets. On real
low-dimensional datasets, this new training method fits RBM models with
significantly faster relaxation dynamics than those obtained with standard PCD
recipes. We also show that TMC sampling can be used to recover the free-energy

resource-constrained network nodes. The XOR Arbiter PUF (XOR PUF or XPUF) is an
intensively studied PUF invented to improve the security of the Arbiter PUF,
probably the most lightweight delay-based PUF. Recently, highly powerful
machine learning attack methods were discovered and were able to easily break
large-sized XPUFs, which were highly secure against earlier machine learning
attack methods. Component-differentially-challenged XPUFs (CDC-XPUFs) are XPUFs
with different component PUFs receiving different challenges. Studies showed
they were much more secure against machine learning attacks than the
conventional XPUFs, whose component PUFs receive the same challenge. But these
studies were all based on earlier machine learning attack methods, and hence it
is not clear if CDC-XPUFs can remain secure under the recently discovered
powerful attack methods. In this paper, the two current most powerful two
machine learning methods for attacking XPUFs are adapted by fine-tuning the
parameters of the two methods for CDC-XPUFs. Attack experiments using both
simulated PUF data and silicon data generated from PUFs implemented on
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) were carried out, and the experimental
results showed that some previously secure CDC-XPUFs of certain circuit
parameter values are no longer secure under the adapted new attack methods,
while many more CDC-XPUFs of other circuit parameter values remain secure.
Thus, our experimental attack study has re-defined the boundary between the
secure region and the insecure region of the PUF circuit parameter space,
providing PUF manufacturers and IoT security application developers with
valuable information in choosing PUFs with secure parameter values.

Navier Stokes equations near a boundary. This question plays a major role in
the study of the inviscid limit of Navier Stokes equations in a bounded domain
as the viscosity goes to $0$.
  The stability of a shear layer for Navier Stokes equations depends on its
stability for Euler equations. If it is linearly unstable for Euler, then it is
known that it is also nonlinearly unstable for Navier Stokes equations provided
the viscosity is small enough: an initial perturbation grows until it reaches
$O(1)$ in $L^\infty$ norm. If it is linearly stable for Euler, the situation is
more complex, since the viscous instability is much slower, with growth rates
of order $O(\nu^{-1/4})$ only (instead of $O(1)$ in the first case). It is not
clear whether linear instabilities fully develop till they reach a magnitude of
order $O(1)$ or whether they are damped by the nonlinearity and saturate at a
much smaller magnitude, or order $O(\nu^{1/4})$ for instance.
  In this paper we study the effect of cubic interactions on the growth of the
linear instability. In the case of the exponential profile and Blasius profile
we obtain that the nonlinearity tame the linear instability. We thus conjecture
that small perturbations grow until they reach a magnitude $O(\nu^{1/4})$ only,
forming small rolls in the critical layer near the boundary. The mathematical
proof of this conjecture is open.

Ideally, the source and target distributions should be aligned to each other

leading to adapting unnecessary source specific knowledge to the target domain,

the uncertainty of a discriminator in adversarial-based DA methods to optimize

decrease of the interlayer plane-plane antiferromagnetic exchange interaction

  Pre-Trained Language Models on Code","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Few-shot learning with large-scale, pre-trained language models is a powerful
way to answer questions about code, e.g., how to complete a given code example,
or even generate code snippets from scratch. The success of these models raises
the question whether they could serve as a basis for building a wide range code
generation tools. Traditionally, such tools are built manually and separately
for each task. Instead, few-shot learning may allow to obtain different tools
from a single pre-trained language model by simply providing a few examples or
a natural language description of the expected tool behavior. This paper
studies to what extent a state-of-the-art, pre-trained language model of code,
Codex, may serve this purpose. We consider three code manipulation and code
generation tasks targeted by a range of traditional tools: (i) code mutation;
(ii) test oracle generation from natural language documentation; and (iii) test
case generation. For each task, we compare few-shot learning to a manually
built tool. Our results show that the model-based tools complement (code
mutation), are on par (test oracle generation), or even outperform their
respective traditionally built tool (test case generation), while imposing far
less effort to develop them. By comparing the effectiveness of different
variants of the model-based tools, we provide insights on how to design an
appropriate input (""prompt"") to the model and what influence the size of the
model has. For example, we find that providing a small natural language
description of the code generation task is an easy way to improve predictions.
Overall, we conclude that few-shot language models are surprisingly effective,
yet there is still more work to be done, such as exploring more diverse ways of
prompting and tackling even more involved tasks.

agreement, however, as to how biological networks could implement the necessary
backpropagation through time, given widely recognized constraints of biological
synaptic network signaling architectures. Here, we propose that extra-synaptic
diffusion of local neuromodulators such as neuropeptides may afford an
effective mode of backpropagation lying within the bounds of biological
plausibility. Going beyond existing temporal truncation-based gradient
approximations, our approximate gradient-based update rule, ModProp, propagates
credit information through arbitrary time steps. ModProp suggests that
modulatory signals can act on receiving cells by convolving their eligibility
traces via causal, time-invariant and synapse-type-specific filter taps. Our
mathematical analysis of ModProp learning, together with simulation results on
benchmark temporal tasks, demonstrate the advantage of ModProp over existing
biologically-plausible temporal credit assignment rules. These results suggest
a potential neuronal mechanism for signaling credit information related to
recurrent interactions over a longer time horizon. Finally, we derive an
in-silico implementation of ModProp that could serve as a low-complexity and
causal alternative to backpropagation through time.

lead to many local optima even in 1-layer setting, each corresponding to
certain patterns from the data distribution, while with linear activation, only
one major pattern can be learned. This suggests that models with lots of
parameters can be regarded as a \emph{brute-force} way to find these local
optima induced by nonlinearity. Second, in the 2-layer case, linear activation
is proven not capable of learning specialized weights into diverse patterns,
demonstrating the importance of nonlinearity. In addition, for 2-layer setting,
we also discover \emph{global modulation}: those local patterns discriminative
from the perspective of global-level patterns are prioritized to learn, further
characterizing the learning process. Simulation verifies our theoretical

imaging and genomic data for building prediction models. Specifically, we
jointly consider two models, one regresses imaging features on genomic
features, and the other regresses patients clinical outcomes on genomic
features. The regularization penalties through sparse group lasso allow
incorporation of intrinsic group information, e.g. biological pathway and
imaging category, to select both important intrinsic groups and important
features within a group. To integrate information from the two models, in each

feature, where the weight is inversely correlated with the model coefficient of
that feature in the other model. This weight allows a feature to have a higher
chance of selection by one model if it is selected by the other model. Our
model is applicable to both continuous and time to event outcomes. It also
allows the use of two separate datasets to fit the two models, addressing a
practical challenge that many genomic datasets do not have imaging data

in one dimension under multiple sudden changes of velocity and/or acceleration.
We develop the appropriate formalism to deal with such situation and we use it
to calculate the probability of transition for simple problems such as the
particle in an infinite box and the simple harmonic oscillator. For the
infinite box of length $L$ under two and three sudden changes of velocity,
where the initial and final velocity vanish, we find that the system undergoes
quantum revivals for $\Delta t = \tau_0 \equiv \frac{4mL^2}{\pi\hbar}$,
regardless of other parameters ($\Delta t$ is the time elapsed between the
first and last change of velocity). For the simple harmonic oscillator we find
that the states obtained by suddenly changing (one change) the velocity and/or
the acceleration of the potential, for a particle initially in an eigenstate of
the static potential, are {\sl coherent} states. For multiple changes of
acceleration or velocity we find that the quantum expectation value of the
Hamiltonian is remarkably close (possibly identical) to the corresponding
classical expectation values. Finally, the probability of transition for a
particle in an accelerating harmonic oscillator (no sudden changes) calculated
with our formalism agrees with the formula derived long time ago by Ludwig and
recently modified by Dodonov~\cite{Dodonov21}, but with a different expression
for the dimensionless parameter $\gamma$. Our probability agrees with the one
of ref.~\cite{Dodonov21} for $\gamma \ll 1$ but is not periodic in time (it
decays monotonously), contrary to the result derived in ref.~\cite{Dodonov21}.

distribution of multiple random variables in a flexible yet interpretable

how to model networks which include a mixture of continuous and discrete random
variables, known as hybrid Bayesian networks. This paper overviews the
literature on approaches to handle hybrid Bayesian networks. Typically one of
two approaches is taken: either the data are considered to have a joint
distribution which is designed for a mixture of discrete and continuous
variables, or continuous random variables are discretized, resulting in
discrete Bayesian networks. In this paper, we propose a strategy to model all
random variables as Gaussian, referred to it as {\it Run it As Gaussian (RAG)}.
We demonstrate that RAG results in more reliable estimates of graph structures
theoretically and by simulation studies, than converting continuous random
variables to discrete. Both strategies are also implemented on a childhood

differences in the optimal graph structures, with the results of the simulation

disclosure risk, it did not provide synthetic data of adequate quality for any

expeditionary science POMDP under real-world constraints requires efficient
probabilistic modeling and decision-making in problems with complex dynamics

sampling, and experimental design have shown compelling results, largely in
static environments, using data-driven models and information-based rewards.
However, these methodologies do not trivially extend to expeditionary science
in spatiotemporal environments: they generally do not make use of scientific
knowledge such as equations of state dynamics, they focus on information
gathering as opposed to scientific task execution, and they make use of
decision-making approaches that scale poorly to large, continuous problems with
long planning horizons and real-time operational constraints. In this work, we
discuss these and other challenges related to probabilistic modeling and
decision-making in expeditionary science, and present some of our preliminary
work that addresses these gaps. We ground our results in a real expeditionary
science deployment of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the deep ocean

approaches have evolved to either improve a single global model while keeping
each local heterogeneous training data decentralized (i.e. data heterogeneity;
Federated Learning (FL)) or to train an overarching network that supports
diverse architectural settings to address heterogeneous systems equipped with
different computational capabilities (i.e. system heterogeneity; Neural
Architecture Search). However, few studies have considered both directions
simultaneously. This paper proposes the federation of supernet training
(FedSup) framework to consider both scenarios simultaneously, i.e., where
clients send and receive a supernet that contains all possible architectures
sampled from itself. The approach is inspired by observing that averaging
parameters during model aggregation for FL is similar to weight-sharing in
supernet training. Thus, the proposed FedSup framework combines a
weight-sharing approach widely used for training single shot models with FL
averaging (FedAvg). Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm (E-FedSup)
by sending the sub-model to clients on the broadcast stage to reduce
communication costs and training overhead, including several strategies to
enhance supernet training in the FL environment. We verify the proposed
approach with extensive empirical evaluations. The resulting framework also
ensures data and model heterogeneity robustness on several standard benchmarks.

In this work we propose a complementary regularization strategy that reduces
confidence on self-generated examples. The method, which we call RCAD (Reducing
Confidence along Adversarial Directions), aims to reduce confidence on
out-of-distribution examples lying along directions adversarially chosen to
increase training loss. In contrast to adversarial training, RCAD does not try
to robustify the model to output the original label, but rather regularizes it
to have reduced confidence on points generated using much larger perturbations
than in conventional adversarial training. RCAD can be easily integrated into
training pipelines with a few lines of code. Despite its simplicity, we find on
many classification benchmarks that RCAD can be added to existing techniques
(e.g., label smoothing, MixUp training) to increase test accuracy by 1-3% in
absolute value, with more significant gains in the low data regime. We also
provide a theoretical analysis that helps to explain these benefits in
simplified settings, showing that RCAD can provably help the model unlearn

such methods rely on the assumption about the availability of all training

because learning the multi-object relations necessary to imagine coherent

strengthen slot correlation learning. The first is to condition the slots on a
global, scene-level variable that captures higher-order correlations between
slots. Second, we address the fundamental lack of a canonical order for objects
by proposing to learn a consistent order to use for the autoregressive
generation of scene objects. Specifically, we train an autoregressive slot
prior to sequentially generate scene objects following the learned order. Slot
inference entails estimating a randomly ordered set of slots using existing
approaches for extracting slots from images, then aligning those slots to
ordered slots generated autoregressively with the prior. Our experiments across
three multi-object environments demonstrate clear gains in scene generation
quality. Detailed ablation studies are also provided that validate the two

while the behavior of the underlying objective function values along the
accelerated iterates is currently not well understood. In this paper, we
investigate local properties of AA with restarting applied to a basic gradient
scheme in terms of function values. Specifically, we show that AA with
restarting is a local descent method and that it can decrease the objective
function faster than the gradient method. These new results theoretically
support the good numerical performance of AA when heuristic descent conditions
are used for globalization and they provide a novel perspective on the
convergence analysis of AA that is more amenable to nonconvex optimization
problems. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our theoretical
findings.

resolution of superlinear microscopy by modulating excitation intensity during
image acquisition. This modulation induces dynamic optical nonlinearity in
upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in variations of higher
spatial-frequency information in the obtained images. The high-order
information can be extracted with a proposed weighted finite difference imaging
algorithm from raw fluorescence images, to generate an image with a higher
resolution than superlinear microscopy images. We apply this approach to
resolve two adjacent nanoparticles within a diffraction-limited area, improving
the resolution to 130 nm. This work suggests a new scope for developing dynamic
nonlinear fluorescent probes in super-resolution nanoscopy.

often double-descent shaped as a function of the model size. Recently, it was
shown that the risk as a function of the early-stopping time can also be
double-descent shaped, and this behavior can be explained as a super-position
of bias-variance tradeoffs. In this paper, we show that the risk of explicit
L2-regularized models can exhibit double descent behavior as a function of the
regularization strength, both in theory and practice. We find that for linear
regression, a double descent shaped risk is caused by a superposition of
bias-variance tradeoffs corresponding to different parts of the model and can
be mitigated by scaling the regularization strength of each part appropriately.
Motivated by this result, we study a two-layer neural network and show that
double descent can be eliminated by adjusting the regularization strengths for
the first and second layer. Lastly, we study a 5-layer CNN and ResNet-18

graph-structured data. With the development of numerous GNN variants, recent
years have witnessed groundbreaking results in improving the scalability of
GNNs to work on static graphs with millions of nodes. However, how to instantly
represent continuous changes of large-scale dynamic graphs with GNNs is still
an open problem. Existing dynamic GNNs focus on modeling the periodic evolution
of graphs, often on a snapshot basis. Such methods suffer from two drawbacks:
first, there is a substantial delay for the changes in the graph to be
reflected in the graph representations, resulting in losses on the model's
accuracy; second, repeatedly calculating the representation matrix on the
entire graph in each snapshot is predominantly time-consuming and severely
limits the scalability. In this paper, we propose Instant Graph Neural Network
(InstantGNN), an incremental computation approach for the graph representation
matrix of dynamic graphs. Set to work with dynamic graphs with the edge-arrival
model, our method avoids time-consuming, repetitive computations and allows
instant updates on the representation and instant predictions. Graphs with
dynamic structures and dynamic attributes are both supported. The upper bounds
of time complexity of those updates are also provided. Furthermore, our method
provides an adaptive training strategy, which guides the model to retrain at
moments when it can make the greatest performance gains. We conduct extensive
experiments on several real-world and synthetic datasets. Empirical results
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while having
orders-of-magnitude higher efficiency than existing methods.

(OD). Currently, not only there is a lack of snowy OD datasets to train
cutting-edge detectors, but also these detectors have difficulties learning
latent information beneficial for detection in snow. To alleviate the two above
problems, we first establish a real-world snowy OD dataset, named RSOD.
Besides, we develop an unsupervised training strategy with a distinctive
activation function, called $Peak \ Act$, to quantitatively evaluate the effect
of snow on each object. Peak Act helps grading the images in RSOD into
four-difficulty levels. To our knowledge, RSOD is the first quantitatively
evaluated and graded snowy OD dataset. Then, we propose a novel Cross Fusion
(CF) block to construct a lightweight OD network based on YOLOv5s (call
CF-YOLO). CF is a plug-and-play feature aggregation module, which integrates
the advantages of Feature Pyramid Network and Path Aggregation Network in a
simpler yet more flexible form. Both RSOD and CF lead our CF-YOLO to possess an
optimization ability for OD in real-world snow. That is, CF-YOLO can handle
unfavorable detection problems of vagueness, distortion and covering of snow.
Experiments show that our CF-YOLO achieves better detection results on RSOD,
compared to SOTAs. The code and dataset are available at

of stellar data, we performed a Sun-as-a-star analysis of H$\alpha$ line
profiles of an M4.2-class solar flare showing dominant emissions from flare
ribbons by using the data of the Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager onboard the
Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope at Hida Observatory. The
Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$ spectra of the flare show red asymmetry of up to
$\sim$95 km s$^{-1}$ and line broadening of up to $\sim$7.5 {\AA}. The
Sun-as-a-star H$\alpha$ profiles are consistent with spectra from flare regions
with weak intensity, but they take smaller redshift velocities and line widths
by a factor of $\sim$2 than those with strong intensity. The redshift
velocities, as well as line widths, peak out and decay more rapidly than the
H$\alpha$ equivalent widths, which is consistent with chromospheric
condensation model and spatially-resolved flare spectra. This suggests that as
a result of superposition, the nature of chromospheric condensation is
observable even from stellar flare spectra. The time evolution of redshift
velocities is found to be similar to that of luminosities of near-ultraviolet
rays (1600 {\AA}), while the time evolution of line broadening is similar to
that of optical white lights. These H$\alpha$ spectral behaviors in
Sun-as-a-star view could be helpful to distinguish whether the origin of
H$\alpha$ red asymmetry of stellar flares is a flare ribbon or other phenomena.

matrix previously was shown to consist of volume integrals of energy-like

Specifically, it shows that such systems' WS time delay matrix can be expressed
by augmenting the previously derived expressions with terms that account for

and the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Comparing the MLR, the ANN, and the XGBoost
algorithm against a common dataset reveals that the XGBoost performs the best
for predicting the sea-surface $p$CO$_2$ in the BoB. Using the
satellite-derived SST and SSS, we predict the sea-surface $p$CO$_2$ using the
XGBoost model and compare the same with the in-situ observations from RAMA
buoy. The model performs satisfactorily, having a correlation of 0.75 and the
RMSE of $\pm$ 12.23 $\mu$atm. Further using this model, we emulate the monthly
variations in the sea-surface $p$CO$_2$ for the central BoB between 2010-2019.
Using the satellite data, we show that the central BoB is warming at a rate of
0.0175 per year, whereas the SSS decreases with a rate of -0.0088 per year. The
modeled $p$CO$_2$ shows a declination at a rate of -0.4852 $\mu$atm per year.
We perform sensitivity experiments to find that the variations in SST and SSS
contribute $\approx$ 41$\%$ and $\approx$ 37$\%$ to the declining trends of the
$p$CO$_2$ for the last decade. Seasonal analysis shows that the pre-monsoon
season has the highest rate of decrease of the sea-surface $p$CO$_2$.

different governing factors such as sea-surface temperature (SST), sea-surface
salinity (SSS), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and total alkalinity (TALK)

to understand the role of each of the governing factors. The results show that
the SST, SSS, and DIC are the principal drivers affecting the sea-surface pH,
while TALK plays a buffering role. The SST and DIC are consistently found to be
opposite to each other. The pre-monsoon season (MAM) has shown to have an
almost equal contribution from all the drivers. In the pre-monsoon season, the
SST and DIC are balanced by TALK and SSS. The role of SSS is significantly
dominant in the second half of the year. Both SST and SSS counter the role of
DIC in the southwest monsoon season. The strong stratification plays an
essential role in modulating the pH of the BoB region. The thickness of the
barrier layer formed in the sub-surface layers positively affects the

previously unseen payloads along a desired trajectory. The contact points and

momentum space. We formulate the evolution kernels at one-loop in perturbative
QCD (pQCD) in a form suitable for numerical implementation and that allows for
an accurate study of their properties. This leads to the first open-source
implementation of GPD evolution equations able to cover the entire kinematic
region and allowing for heavy-quark-threshold crossings. The numerical
implementation of the GPD evolution equations is publicly accessible through
the APFEL++ evolution library and is available within the PARTONS framework.
  Our formulation makes use of the operator definition of GPDs in light-cone
gauge renormalised in the $\overline{\mbox{MS}}$ scheme. For the sake of
clarity, we recompute the evolution kernels at one-loop in pQCD, confirming
previous calculations. We obtain general conditions on the evolution kernels
deriving from the GPD sum rules and show that our formulation obeys these
conditions. We analytically show that our calculation reproduces the DGLAP and
the ERBL equations in the appropriate limits and that it guarantees the
continuity of GPDs. We numerically check that the evolved GPDs fulfil DGLAP and
ERBL limits, continuity, and polynomiality. We benchmark our numerical
implementation against analytical evolution in conformal space. Finally, we
perform a numerical comparison to an existing implementation of GPD evolution
finding a general good agreement on the kinematic region accessible to the
latter.
  This work provides a pedagogical description of GPD evolution equations which
benefits from a renewed interest as future colliders, such as the electron-ion
colliders in the US and in China, are being designed. It also paves the way to
the extension of GPD evolution codes to higher accuracies in pQCD desirable for
precision phenomenology at these facilities.

important scheme in minimizing medical expenses. Following this, the healthcare
industry has seen a significant increase in fraudulent activities owing to
increased insurance, and fraud has become a significant contributor to rising
medical care expenses, although its impact can be mitigated using fraud
detection techniques. To detect fraud, machine learning techniques are used.
The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) of the United States
federal government released ""Medicare Part D"" insurance claims is utilized in
this study to develop fraud detection system. Employing machine learning
algorithms on a class-imbalanced and high dimensional medicare dataset is a
challenging task. To compact such challenges, the present work aims to perform
feature extraction following data sampling, afterward applying various
classification algorithms, to get better performance. Feature extraction is a
dimensionality reduction approach that converts attributes into linear or
non-linear combinations of the actual attributes, generating a smaller and more
diversified set of attributes and thus reducing the dimensions. Data sampling
is commonlya used to address the class imbalance either by expanding the
frequency of minority class or reducing the frequency of majority class to
obtain approximately equal numbers of occurrences for both classes. The
proposed approach is evaluated through standard performance metrics. Thus, to
detect fraud efficiently, this study applies autoencoder as a feature
extraction technique, synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) as a
data sampling technique, and various gradient boosted decision tree-based
classifiers as a classification algorithm. The experimental results show the
combination of autoencoders followed by SMOTE on the LightGBM classifier
achieved best results.

images, we use multimodal deep learning, where the two modalities, i.e., images

casting the optics as an encoder that produces learned embeddings directly at

recover meaningful images from these measurements. Additional experiments show

system. The earliest cameras were in fact lensless, relying on long exposure
times to form images on the other end of a small aperture in a darkened
room/container (camera obscura). The introduction of a lens allowed for more
light throughput and therefore shorter exposure times, while retaining sharp
focus. The incorporation of digital sensors readily enabled the use of
computational imaging techniques to post-process and enhance raw images (e.g.
via deblurring, inpainting, denoising, sharpening). Recently, imaging
scientists have started leveraging computational imaging as an integral part of
lensless imaging systems, allowing them to form viewable images from the highly
multiplexed raw measurements of lensless cameras (see [5] and references
therein for a comprehensive treatment of lensless imaging). This represents a
real paradigm shift in camera system design as there is more flexibility to
cater the hardware to the application at hand (e.g. lightweight or flat
designs). This increased flexibility comes however at the price of a more
demanding post-processing of the raw digital recordings and a tighter
integration of sensing and computation, often difficult to achieve in practice
due to inefficient interactions between the various communities of scientists
involved. With LenslessPiCam, we provide an easily accessible hardware and

data, posing a significant challenge to generalization to unseen distributions.
To address this, we propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization
scheme called WAFL. Leveraging its duality, we frame WAFL as an empirical
surrogate risk minimization problem, and solve it using a local SGD-based
algorithm with convergence guarantees. We show that the robustness of WAFL is
more general than related approaches, and the generalization bound is robust to
all adversarial distributions inside the Wasserstein ball (ambiguity set).
Since the center location and radius of the Wasserstein ball can be suitably
modified, WAFL shows its applicability not only in robustness but also in
domain adaptation. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that WAFL
generalizes better than the vanilla FedAvg in non-i.i.d. settings, and is more
robust than other related methods in distribution shift settings. Further,
using benchmark datasets we show that WAFL is capable of generalizing to unseen
target domains.

reduce human effort and pose a lesser risk to their lives. Generally, the
locomotion techniques of these robots can be classified into mechanical and
bioinspired. By using slot-follower leg mechanisms, DC-motors, and control
units, a rigid caterpillar type inspection robot was designed and developed at
LS2N, France . This rigid prototype helped in identifying the static forces
required to accomplish good contact forces with the pipeline walls. In order to
work inside curvatures, a tensegrity mechanism that uses three tension springs
and a passive universal joint was introduced between each module of this robot.
The optimal parameters of the robot assembly were identified by considering a
preload of the cables, which ensured the stability of the entire robot.
However, under static conditions, there exist some forces on the robot,
especially on the tensegrity mechanism when one end of the leg mechanism is
clamped with the pipeline walls. These forces are dominant when the orientation
of the pipeline is horizontal. The objective of this article is to understand
the effect of the stiffness of the spring on the static stability of the
tensegrity mechanism under the self-weight of the robot assembly.

proposes a simple topology and controller that can fork off a second

supermassive black hole (SMBH) with mass in the range of $10^6M_\odot$ $-$
$10^{10}M_\odot$. It is suggested that the mass of SMBHs is proportionally
related to that of the dark matter (DM) halo, even at $z= 6$. This implies that
these SMBHs could coevolve with the host DM halos. Here, we investigate the
mass evolution of SMBHs in a hierarchical structure formation by building halo
merger trees using the extended Press-Schechter formalism. An SMBH with a mass
that follows various power-law relations with the DM halo mass is assigned as
an initial condition. Assuming that the mass growth of all black holes is due
to mergers, we obtain the relation between SMBH and DM halo masses at the
present epoch. By requiring that the mass of the SMBHs at $z=0$ should not be
greater than the currently observed SMBH-DM halo mass relation, a lower bound
on the mass of the DM halo that can contain a SMBH can be imposed at $z= 6$ as
$M_{\rm lim} > 3.6 \times 10^{10} M_\odot\times (1.4-n)^{2.3}$, where $n$ is
the power-law index of the SMBH-DM halo mass relation at $z=6$. Because we only
consider mergers for the mass evolution of SMBHs, this model is simplistic and
should underestimate the mass of SMBHs relative to the mass of the DM halo at

ability to create massive amounts of labeled data, requiring only little manual
effort. Standard approaches use labeling functions to specify signals that are
relevant for the labeling. It has been conjectured that weakly supervised
models over-rely on those signals and as a result suffer from overfitting. To
verify this assumption, we introduce a novel method, XPASC
(eXPlainability-Association SCore), for measuring the generalization of a model
trained with a weakly supervised dataset. Considering the occurrences of
features, classes and labeling functions in a dataset, XPASC takes into account
the relevance of each feature for the predictions of the model as well as the
associations of the feature with the class and the labeling function,
respectively. The association in XPASC can be measured in two variants:
XPASC-CHI SQAURE measures associations relative to their statistical
significance, while XPASC-PPMI measures association strength more generally. We
use XPASC to analyze KnowMAN, an adversarial architecture intended to control
the degree of generalization from the labeling functions and thus to mitigate
the problem of overfitting. On one hand, we show that KnowMAN is able to
control the degree of generalization through a hyperparameter. On the other
hand, results and qualitative analysis show that generalization and performance
do not relate one-to-one, and that the highest degree of generalization does
not necessarily imply the best performance. Therefore methods that allow for
controlling the amount of generalization can achieve the right degree of benign
overfitting. Our contributions in this study are i) the XPASC score to measure
generalization in weakly-supervised models, ii) evaluation of XPASC across
datasets and models and iii) the release of the XPASC implementation.

system coupled to a waveguide. In this set-up, the two-level system in the
cavity can work as a photon source, and the photon emitted into the waveguide
can re-interact with the cavity-QED system many times after the transmission
and reflection in the waveguide, during which the feedback can tune the number
of the photons in and out of the cavity. We analyze the dynamics of two-photon
processes in this coherent feedback network in two scenarios: the continuous
mode coupling scheme and the discrete periodic mode coupling scheme between the
waveguide and cavity. The difference of these coupling schemes is due to their
relative scales and the number of semi-transparent mirrors for coupling.
Specifically, in the continuous mode coupling scheme, the generation of
two-photon states is influenced by the length of the feedback loop by the
waveguide and the coupling strength between the waveguide and the cavity-QED
system. By tuning the length of the waveguide and the coupling strength, we are
able to generate two-photon states efficiently. In the discrete periodic mode
coupling scheme, the Rabi oscillation in the cavity can be stabilized and there
are no notable two-photon states in the waveguide.

parametric models such as exponential, gamma, Weibull, and log-normal
distributions to appropriately fit such data having instantaneous failure
observations. Researchers also find bivariate correlated life testing data
having many observations near a particular point while the remaining
observations follow some continuous distribution. This situation defines as
responses having early failures for such bivariate responses. If the point is
the origin, then we call the situation a nearly instantaneous failure for the
responses. Here, we propose a modified bivariate Weibull distribution that
allows early failure by combining bivariate uniform distribution and bivariate
Weibull distribution. The bivariate Weibull distribution is constructed using a
2-dimensional copula, assuming the marginal distributions as two parametric
Weibull distributions. We derive some properties of that modified bivariate

for the $w$CDM parameter constraints that can be expected from stage 3 and 4

photometric redshift uncertainties and intrinsic alignment. The impact of
baryons is investigated and the necessary scale cuts are applied. We compare
the angular power spectrum analysis to peak and minima counts as well as
Minkowski functionals of the mass maps. We find a preference for Starlet over
Gaussian filters. Our results suggest that using a survey setup with 10 instead
of 5 tomographic redshift bins is beneficial. Adding cross-tomographic

intrinsic alignment for all statistics. In terms of constraining power, we find
the angular power spectrum and the peak counts to be equally matched for stage
4 surveys, followed by minima counts and the Minkowski functionals. Combining
different summary statistics significantly improves the constraints and
compensates the stringent scale cuts. We identify the most `cost-effective'

of the heterogeneous processing architecture and dynamic environments, as well
as limited and partial observability of each LB agent in distributed networking
systems, which can largely degrade the performance of in-production load
balancing algorithms in real-world setups.
Centralised-training-decentralised-execution (CTDE) RL scheme has been proposed
to improve MARL performance, yet it incurs -- especially in distributed
networking systems, which prefer distributed and plug-and-play design scheme --
additional communication and management overhead among agents. We formulate the
multi-agent load balancing problem as a Markov potential game, with a carefully
and properly designed workload distribution fairness as the potential function.
A fully distributed MARL algorithm is proposed to approximate the Nash
equilibrium of the game. Experimental evaluations involve both an event-driven
simulator and real-world system, where the proposed MARL load balancing
algorithm shows close-to-optimal performance in simulations, and superior
results over in-production LBs in the real-world system.

ultrafast magnetization dynamics of a thin flake of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ (FGT) and
extract its intrinsic magnetic properties using a microscopic framework. We
find that our data is well described by our modelling, with FGT undergoing a
slow two-step demagnetization, and we experimentally extract the
spin-relaxation timescale as a function of temperature, magnetic field and
excitation fluence. Our observations indicate a large spin-flip probability in
agreement with a theoretically expected large spin-orbit coupling, as well as a
weak interlayer exchange coupling. The spin-flip probability is found to
increase when the magnetization is pulled away from its quantization axis,
opening doors to an external control over the spins in this material. Our

electronic structure of the bilayer. Here, we use Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations to investigate the interplay between an external applied
heterostrain and the resulting stacking in BLG. We determine how a strain
applied to one layer is transferred to a second, 'free' layer and at what
critical strain the ground-state AB-stacking is disrupted. To overcome
limitations introduced by periodic boundary conditions, we consider an
approximate system consisting of an infinite graphene sheet and an armchair
graphene nanoribbon (AGNR). We find that above a critical strain of ~1%, it is
energetically favourable for the free layer to be unstrained, indicating a
transition between uniform AB-stacking and non-uniform mixed stacking. This is
in agreement with a simple model estimate based on the individual energy
contributions of strain and stacking effects. Our findings suggest that small
levels of strain provide a platform to reversibly engineer stacking order and
Moir\'e features in bilayers, providing a viable alternative to twistronics to
engineer topological and exotic physical phenomena in such systems.

significantly affected by a thermal friction induced by the axion coupling to
thermalized hidden sector. We examine the effects of such a thermal friction on
axion dark matter density and its perturbation when the thermal friction
dominates over the Hubble friction until when the axion field begins to
oscillate around the potential minimum. We show that in the presence of sizable
thermal friction there can be an exponential decay phase of the axion field
before the oscillation phase, during which the axion energy density is
efficiently dissipated into hidden thermal bath. Consequently, the previously
excluded parameter region due to overclosing relic axion density becomes
cosmologically viable with thermal friction. In particular, a QCD axion much
lighter than $\mu$eV is viable without tuning the initial misalignment angle.
We also find that thermal friction can affect the density perturbation of axion
dark matter in various ways. For instance, it can alleviate the large-scale
isocurvature bound on axion dark matter in the pre-inflationary PQ breaking
scenario, which would make the pre-inflationary axion dark matter compatible
with high scale inflation over a wide range of model parameters. In the
post-inflationary PQ breaking scenario, thermal friction can also significantly
change the scaling behavior of axionic strings, and therefore the typical size

systems is an important open problem that limits the wider adoption of
autonomous systems in safety-critical applications. One promising solution to
address this problem is barrier functions. The composition of a barrier
function with a stochastic system forms a supermartingale, thus enabling the
computation of the probability that the system stays in a safe set over a
finite time horizon via martingale inequalities. However, existing approaches
to find barrier functions for stochastic systems generally rely on convex
optimization programs that restrict the search of a barrier to a small class of
functions such as low degree SoS polynomials and can be computationally
expensive. In this paper, we parameterize a barrier function as a neural
network and show that techniques for robust training of neural networks can be
successfully employed to find neural barrier functions. Specifically, we
leverage bound propagation techniques to certify that a neural network
satisfies the conditions to be a barrier function via linear programming and
then employ the resulting bounds at training time to enforce the satisfaction
of these conditions. We also present a branch-and-bound scheme that makes the
certification framework scalable. We show that our approach outperforms
existing methods in several case studies and often returns certificates of

combinatorial interpretation of the rank of Jacobian of a graph is unknown. Our
paper presents a contribution in this direction, in particular we have proved
that Cayley graphs of degree at least three based on non-abelian groups have

function value from images, fewer recommendations are available. In this study,
a novel CNN regression model is proposed. It combines convolutional neural
layers to extract high level features representations from images with a soft
labelling technique. More specifically, as the deep regression task is
challenging, the idea is to account for some uncertainty in the targets that
are seen as distributions around their mean. The estimations are carried out by
the model in the form of distributions. Building from earlier work, a specific
histogram loss function based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is
applied during training. The model takes advantage of the CNN feature
representation and is able to carry out estimation from multi-channel input
images. To assess and illustrate the technique, the model is applied to Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) multi-path estimation where multi-path
signal parameters have to be estimated from correlator output images from the I
and Q channels. The multi-path signal delay, magnitude, Doppler shift frequency
and phase parameters are estimated from synthetically generated datasets of
satellite signals. Experiments are conducted under various receiving conditions
and various input images resolutions to test the estimation performances
quality and robustness. The results show that the proposed soft labelling CNN
technique using distributional loss outperforms classical CNN regression under
all conditions. Furthermore, the extra learning performance achieved by the

Scientists performing research in the fields of biology, medicine and pharmacy
often prefer NMF over other dimensionality reduction approaches (such as PCA)
because the non-negativity of the approach naturally fits the characteristics
of the domain problem and its result is easier to analyze and understand.
Despite these advantages, it still can be hard to get exact characterization
and interpretation of the NMF's resulting latent factors due to their numerical
nature. On the other hand, rule-based approaches are often considered more
interpretable but lack the parts-based interpretation. In this work, we present
a version of the NMF approach that merges rule-based descriptions with
advantages of part-based representation offered by the NMF approach. Given the
numerical input data with non-negative entries and a set of rules with high
entity coverage, the approach creates the lower-dimensional non-negative
representation of the input data in such a way that its factors are described
by the appropriate subset of the input rules. In addition to revealing
important attributes for latent factors, it allows analyzing relations between
these attributes and provides the exact numerical intervals or categorical
values they take. The proposed approach provides numerous advantages in tasks
such as focused embedding or performing supervised multi-label NMF.

host galaxies, and between the structural properties of nucleated and
non-nucleated galaxies. We also address the environmental influences on the
nucleation of galaxies in the Fornax main cluster and the Fornax A group. We
select 557 Fornax galaxies ($10^{5.5} M_{\odot} < M_{\rm *,galaxy} < 10^{11.5}
M_{\odot} $) for which structural decomposition models and non-parametric
indices are available. We determine galaxy nucleation based on a combination of
visual inspection and a model selection statistic, the Bayesian information
criterion (BIC). We also test the BIC as an unsupervised method to determine
nucleation labels. We find a dichotomy in the properties of nuclei which reside
in galaxies more or less massive than $M_{\rm *,galaxy} \approx 10^{8.5}
M_{\odot}$. Specifically, the nuclei tend to be bluer than their host galaxies
and follow a scaling relation of $M_{\rm *,nuc} \propto {M_{\rm
*,galaxy}}^{0.5}$ for $M_{\rm *,galaxy} < 10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$. In galaxies with
$M_{\rm *,galaxy} > 10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$ we find that nuclei are redder compared
to the host and follow $M_{\rm *,nuc} \propto M_{\rm *,galaxy}$. Comparing
early-type galaxies, we find that nucleated galaxies tend to be redder in
global ($g'-r'$) colour, have redder outskirts relative to their own inner
regions ($\Delta (g'-r')$), be less asymmetric ($A$) and exhibit less scatter
in the brightest second order moment of light ($M_{20}$) than their
non-nucleated counterparts at a given stellar mass. Additionally, we find the
nucleation fractions to be typically higher in the Fornax main cluster than in
the Fornax A group, and that the nucleation fraction is highest towards the
centre of their respective environments. We also find that the BIC can recover
our labels of nucleation up to an accuracy of 97\%. (abridged)

specifications expressed in a safety fragment of LTL that includes bounded
future temporal operators. Tableau decision procedures for temporal and modal
logics have been thoroughly studied for satisfiability and for translating
temporal formulae into equivalent B\""uchi automata, and also for model
checking, where a specification and system are provided. However, to the best
of our knowledge no tableau method has been studied for the reactive synthesis
problem.
  Reactive synthesis starts from a specification where propositional variables
are split into those controlled by the environment and those controlled by the
system, and consists on automatically producing a system that guarantees the
specification for all environments. Realizability is the decision problem of
whether there is one such system.
  In this paper we present a method to decide realizability of safety
specifications, from which we can also extract (i.e. synthesize) a correct
system (in case the specification is realizable). Our method can easily be
extended to handle richer domains (integers, etc) and bounds in the temporal
operators in ways that automata approaches for synthesis cannot.

critical ingredient in the path towards predictive or condition-based
maintenance of high value structures. The use of acoustic emission time of
arrival mapping is a promising approach to this challenge, but is severely
hindered by the need to collect a dense set of artificial acoustic emission
measurements across the structure, resulting in a lengthy and often impractical
data acquisition process. In this paper, we consider the use of
physics-informed Gaussian processes for learning these maps to alleviate this
problem. In the approach, the Gaussian process is constrained to the physical
domain such that information relating to the geometry and boundary conditions
of the structure are embedded directly into the learning process, returning a
model that guarantees that any predictions made satisfy physically-consistent
behaviour at the boundary. A number of scenarios that arise when training
measurement acquisition is limited, including where training data are sparse,
and also of limited coverage over the structure of interest. Using a complex
plate-like structure as an experimental case study, we show that our approach
significantly reduces the burden of data collection, where it is seen that
incorporation of boundary condition knowledge significantly improves predictive
accuracy as training observations are reduced, particularly when training
measurements are not available across all parts of the structure.

reasons, including shared characteristics between regions, and human or vector

account for spatial connectivity. However, conventional approaches require the
spatial structure to be fully defined prior to model fitting. By applying
penalised smoothing splines to coordinates, we create 2-dimensional smooth
surfaces describing the spatial structure of the data whilst making minimal
assumptions about the structure. The result is a non-stationary surface which
is setting specific. These surfaces can be incorporated into a hierarchical
modelling framework and interpreted similarly to traditional random effects.
Through simulation studies we show that the splines can be applied to any
continuous connectivity measure, including measures of human movement, and that
the models can be extended to explore multiple sources of spatial structure in
the data. Using Bayesian inference and simulation, the relative contribution of
each spatial structure can be computed and used to generate hypotheses about
the drivers of disease. These models were found to perform at least as well as
existing modelling frameworks, whilst allowing for future extensions and
multiple sources of spatial connectivity.

the magnetic field strength, both of which are connected to the size of the
magnetosphere. We find that for the majority of objects in our sample the
measured break frequency values indeed agree with estimated inner radii of the
accretion disc, which allows to use observed break frequencies to independently
assess the magnetic field strength and structure in accreting compact objects.
As a special case, we focus on Hercules X-1 which is a persistent,
medium-luminosity X-ray pulsar accreting from its low-mass companion. In the
literature, it has been suggested that the complex pulse profiles, the spin-up
behaviour and the luminosity-correlation of the cyclotron energy seen in Her
X-1 can be explained with a complex magnetic field structure of the neutron
star. Here, we connect the measured break frequency to the magnetospheric
radius and show that the magnetic field strength derived assuming a dipole
configuration is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the magnetic field
strength corresponding to the cyclotron energy. Accordingly, this discrepancy
can be explained with the magnetic field having strong multipole components.
The multipolar structure would also increase the accreting area on the neutron
star surface, explaining why the critical luminosity for accretion column
formation is puzzlingly high in this source.

high-temperature superconducting (SC) copper oxides Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_6$
(Bi2201, $N_{\ell}=1$, $T_c^{\rm exp} \sim 10$ K), Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$
(Bi2212, $N_{\ell}=2$, $T_c^{\rm exp} \sim 84$ K), HgBa$_2$CuO$_4$ (Hg1201,
$N_{\ell}=1$, $T_c^{\rm exp} \sim 90$ K) and CaCuO$_2$ (Ca11,
$N_{\ell}=\infty$, $T_c^{\rm exp} \sim 110$ K), with different experimental
optimal SC transition temperature $T_c^{\rm exp}$ and number $N_{\ell}$ of
laminated CuO$_2$ planes between the two neighboring block layers. We apply the
latest methodology of the multiscale $ab$ $initio$ scheme for correlated
electron systems (MACE), and focus on the LEH consisting of one antibonding
(AB) Cu$3d_{x^2-y^2}$/O$2p_{\sigma}$ orbital centered on each Cu atom. We
discuss prominent features of this LEH: (1) The ratio $U/|t_1|$ between the
onsite effective Coulomb repulsion (ECR) $U$ and amplitude of nearest neighbour
hopping $t_1$ increases with $T^{\rm exp}_c$ and $N_{\ell}$, consistently with
the expected increase in $d$-wave SC correlation function $P_{dd}$ with
$U/|t_1|$. One possible cause of the increase of $U/|t_1|$ is the replacement
of apical O atoms by Cu atoms from neighbouring CuO$_2$ planes when $N_{\ell}$
increases. Furthermore, we show that the increase in distance between Cu and
apical O atoms decreases the effective screening (ES) by electrons outside of
the LEH and increases $U/|t_1|$. (2) For Hg1201 and Ca11, we show that
$U/|t_1|$ decreases when hole doping per AB orbital $\delta$ increases, which
may partly account for the disappearance of SC when $\delta$ exceeds the
optimal value in experiment. (3) For $N_{\ell} \geq 2$, off-site inter-CuO$_2$
plane ECR is comparable to off-site intra-CuO$_2$ plane ECR. We discuss
contributions of inter-CuO$_2$ plane ECR to both $P_{dd}$ and the stability of
the SC state.

state-state transitions encode rich phrase constructions and serve as the

existing machine learning models, which are often adopted by churn communities,

capability. Therefore, a novel algorithm, a hybrid neural network with
self-attention enhancement (HNNSAE), is proposed in this paper to improve the
efficiency of feature screening and feature extraction, consequently improving
the model's predictive performance. This model consists of three main blocks.
The first block is the entity embedding layer, which is employed to process the
categorical variables transformed into 0-1 code. The second block is the
feature extractor, which extracts the significant features through the
multi-head self-attention mechanism. In addition, to improve the feature
extraction effect, we stack the residual connection neural network on
multi-head self-attention modules. The third block is a classifier, which is a
three-layer multilayer perceptron. This work conducts experiments on publicly
available dataset related to commercial bank customers. The result demonstrates
that HNNSAE significantly outperforms the other Individual Machine Learning
(IML), Ensemble Machine Learning (EML), and Deep Learning (DL) methods tested
in this paper. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the feature extractor
proposed in this paper with that of other three feature extractors and find
that the method proposed in this paper significantly outperforms other methods.

risk are tested on the publicly available dataset.

representative GCL works, DGI and MVGRL, we revisit GCL and introduce a new
learning paradigm for self-supervised graph representation learning, namely,
Group Discrimination (GD), and propose a novel GD-based method called Graph
Group Discrimination (GGD). Instead of similarity computation, GGD directly
discriminates two groups of node samples with a very simple binary
cross-entropy loss. In addition, GGD requires much fewer training epochs to
obtain competitive performance compared with GCL methods on large-scale
datasets. These two advantages endow GGD with very efficient property.
Extensive experiments show that GGD outperforms state-of-the-art
self-supervised methods on eight datasets. In particular, GGD can be trained in
0.18 seconds (6.44 seconds including data preprocessing) on ogbn-arxiv, which
is orders of magnitude (10,000+) faster than GCL baselines while consuming much
less memory. Trained with 9 hours on ogbn-papers100M with billion edges, GGD
outperforms its GCL counterparts in both accuracy and efficiency.

which is a model for linearized elasticity in a medium with two elastic phases
that evolve subject to a Ginzburg-Landau type energy functional. The system can
be seen as a combination of the Cahn-Hilliard regularized interface equation
and linearized elasticity, and is non-linearly coupled, has a fourth order term
that comes from the Cahn-Hilliard subsystem, and is non-convex and nonlinear in
both the phase-field and displacement variables. We propose a novel
semi-implicit discretization in time that uses a standard convex-concave
splitting method of the nonlinear double-well potential, as well as special
treatment to the elastic energy. We show that the resulting discrete system is
equivalent to a convex minimization problem, and propose and prove the
convergence of alternating minimization applied to it. Finally, we present
numerical experiments that show the robustness and effectiveness of both
alternating minimization and the monolithic Newton method applied to the newly
proposed discrete system of equations. We compare it to a system of equations
that has been discretized with a standard convex-concave splitting of the
double-well potential, and implicit evaluations of the elasticity contributions

principled way to include prior physical knowledge in form of partial
differential equations (PDEs) into neural networks. Although PINNs are
generally viewed as mesh-free, current approaches still rely on collocation
points within a bounded region, even in settings with spatially sparse signals.
Furthermore, if the boundaries are not known, the selection of such a region is
difficult and often results in a large proportion of collocation points being
selected in areas of low relevance. To resolve this severe drawback of current
methods, we present a mesh-free and adaptive approach termed particle-density
PINN (pdPINN), which is inspired by the microscopic viewpoint of fluid
dynamics. The method is based on the Eulerian formulation and, different from
classical mesh-free method, does not require the introduction of Lagrangian
updates. We propose to sample directly from the distribution over the particle
positions, eliminating the need to introduce boundaries while adaptively
focusing on the most relevant regions. This is achieved by interpreting a
non-negative physical quantity (such as the density or temperature) as an
unnormalized probability distribution from which we sample with dynamic Monte
Carlo methods. The proposed method leads to higher sample efficiency and
improved performance of PINNs. These advantages are demonstrated on various
experiments based on the continuity equations, Fokker-Planck equations, and the
heat equation.

capture many common structural properties of real-world networks, such as
self-invariance and high clustering. Indeed, many real-world networks can be
accurately modeled by positioning vertices of a network graph in hyperbolic
spaces. Nevertheless, if one observes only the network connections, the
presence of geometry is not always evident. Currently, triangle counts and
clustering coefficients are the standard statistics to signal the presence of
geometry. In this paper we show that triangle counts or clustering coefficients
are insufficient because they fail to detect geometry induced by hyperbolic
spaces. We therefore introduce a novel triangle-based statistic, which weighs
triangles based on their strength of evidence for geometry. We show
analytically, as well as on synthetic and real-world data, that this is a
powerful statistic to detect hyperbolic geometry in networks.

and there are uncountably many of them. Eleven of these ages are almost
multichainable; they remain w.q.o when labels in a w.q.o are added, hence have
finitely many bounds. Five ages among them are exhaustible. Among the remaining
ones, only countably many remain w.q.o when one label is added, and these have
finitely many bounds (except for the age of the infinite path and its
complement). The others have infinitely many bounds.
  Except for six examples, members of these ages we characterize are
permutation graphs. In fact, every age which is not among the eleven ones is
the age of a graph associated to a uniformly recurrent word on the integers. A
description of minimal prime classes of posets and bichains is also provided.

to plan sufficient preventive maintenance to avoid machine failures and
overhauls. Maintenance is often imperfect in reality and does not make the
asset as good as new. Although a variety of imperfect maintenance policies have
been proposed in the literature, these rely on strong assumptions regarding the
effect of maintenance on the machine's condition, assuming the effect is (1)
deterministic or governed by a known probability distribution, and (2)
machine-independent. This work proposes to relax both assumptions by learning
the effect of maintenance conditional on a machine's characteristics from
observational data on similar machines using existing methodologies for causal
inference. By predicting the maintenance effect, we can estimate the number of
overhauls and failures for different levels of maintenance and, consequently,
optimize the preventive maintenance frequency to minimize the total estimated
cost. We validate our proposed approach using real-life data on more than 4,000

our novel, causal approach accurately predicts the maintenance effect and

  !",,,,"math.AG math.AT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We initiate a study of punctured tubular neighborhoods and homotopy theory at
infinity in motivic settings. We use the six functors formalism to give an
intrinsic definition of the stable motivic homotopy type at infinity of an
algebraic variety. Our main computational tools include cdh-descent for normal
crossing divisors, Euler classes, Gysin maps, and homotopy purity. Under
$\ell$-adic realization, the motive at infinity recovers a formula for
vanishing cycles due to Rapoport-Zink; similar results hold for Steenbrink's
limiting Hodge structures and Wildeshaus' boundary motives. Under the
topological Betti realization, the stable motivic homotopy type at infinity of
an algebraic variety recovers the singular complex at infinity of the
corresponding topological space. We coin the notion of homotopically smooth
morphisms with respect to a motivic $\infty$-category and use it to show a
generalization to virtual vector bundles of Morel-Voevodsky's purity theorem,
which yields an escalated form of Atiyah duality with compact support. Further,
we study a quadratic refinement of intersection degrees, taking values in
motivic cohomotopy groups. For relative surfaces, we show the stable motivic
homotopy type at infinity witnesses a quadratic version of Mumford's plumbing
construction for smooth complex algebraic surfaces. Our construction and
computation of stable motivic links of Du Val singularities on normal surfaces
is expressed entirely in terms of Dynkin diagrams. In characteristic p>0, this
improves Artin's analysis on Du Val singularities through \'etale local
fundamental groups. The main results in the paper are also valid for
$\ell$-adic sheaves, mixed Hodge modules, and more generally motivic
$\infty$-categories.

wireless communication networks due to, among others, the huge unlicensed
bandwidth it offers and the fact that it does not cause any interference to
existing radio frequency (RF) communication systems. Most research on RF and
VLC coexistence has focused on hybrid designs where data transmission to any
user could originate from either an RF or a VLC access point (AP). However,
hybrid RF/VLC systems fail to exploit the distinct transmission characteristics
of RF and VLC systems to fully reap the benefits they can offer. Aggregated
RF/VLC systems, in which any user can be served simultaneously by both RF and
VLC APs, have recently emerged as a more promising and robust design for the
coexistence of RF and VLC systems. To this end, this paper, for the first time,
investigates AP assignment, subchannel allocation (SA), and transmit power
allocation (PA) to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) of aggregated RF/VLC
systems while considering the effects of interference and VLC line-of-sight
link blockages. A novel and challenging EE optimization problem is formulated
for which an efficient joint solution based on alternating optimization is
developed. More particularly, an energy-efficient AP assignment algorithm based
on matching theory is proposed. Then, a low-complexity SA scheme that allocates
subchannels to users based on their channel conditions is developed. Finally,
an effective PA algorithm is presented by utilizing the quadratic transform
approach and a multi-objective optimization framework. Extensive simulation
results reveal that: 1) the proposed joint AP assignment, SA, and PA solution
obtains significant EE, sum-rate, and outage performance gains with low
complexity, and 2) the aggregated RF/VLC system provides considerable
performance improvement compared to hybrid RF/VLC systems.

a deterministic connectivity algorithm that matches all the parameters of the

reducing the amount of randomness needed to allow for a simpler efficient

interactions and thermal motion. Despite some phenomenological resemblance,
including signatures of criticality, the autonomous dynamics that binds motile
agents into flocks, herds, or swarms allows for much richer behavior.
Low-dimensional models have hinted at the crucial role played in this respect
by perceived information, decision-making, and feedback implying that the
corresponding interactions are inevitably retarded. Here we present experiments
on spherical Brownian microswimmers with delayed self-propulsion toward a
spatially fixed target. We observe a spontaneous symmetry breaking to a
transiently chiral dynamical state and concomitant critical behavior that does
not rely on many-particle cooperativity. By comparison with the stochastic
delay differential equation of motion of a single swimmer, we pinpoint the
delay-induced effective synchronization of the swimmers with their own past as
its key mechanism. Increasing numbers of swimmers self-organize into layers
with pro- and retrograde orbital motion, synchronized and stabilized by steric
and hydrodynamic interactions. Our results demonstrate how even most simple

(SMEFT), are defined by a chosen field content and a set of symmetries, up to a

independent field re-definitions consistent with the symmetries of the theory
are then used to redefine the fields. This procedure results in a fixed
(non-redundant) operator basis, that is not itself field re-definition
invariant. Recently, an alternative approach of identifying and calculating
with field space geometry has been developed. Field redefinition invariants,
characterising field space geometry, appear in observables in amplitude
perturbations, and have an expansion in terms of local operators. In the case
of the SMEFT, calculating via the geometric approach is known as the geoSMEFT.
This approach makes it much easier to calculate at high orders in $1/\Lambda$
in the SMEFT, and can directly result in a complete characterisation of an
amplitude perturbation in the $1/\Lambda$ expansion. Using the geoSMEFT,
several consistent and complete $\mathcal{O}(1/\Lambda^4)$ results are now

We used the Ultraviolet telescope UVIT on board Astrosat to image the Dorado
backbone galaxies previously observed in Ha+[NII], with the far-UV filter
FUV.CaF2 (1300-1800A). The sample includes NGC1536, NGC1546, NGC1549,
[CMI2001]4136-01, NGC1553, IC2058, PGC75125,NGC1566, NGC1596 and NGC1602.
FUV.CaF2 emission is revealed in all galaxies, tracing young stellar
populations in rings and showing tidal distortions. The Sersic index, derived
by fitting the luminosity profiles, is always n<3 suggesting that the FUV.CaF2
emission originates from a disk also in ETGs. The SFR ranges from 0.004+-0.001
M_sol yr^{-1} of [CMI2001]4136-01 to 2.455+-0.027 M_sol yr^{-1} of NGC 1566.
Most of the recent SF is found at the periphery of the Dorado group where most
of LTGs are located. For these galaxies, the ratio SFR_Ha/SFR_FUV.CaF2 is close
to 1, except for the edge-on IC 2058, similarly to previously reported
relations for Local Volume samples. For ETGs, however, SFR_Ha is about 15 times
higher than SFR_FUV. The Dorado's ETGs define a separate locus in SFR_FUV,
SFR_Ha space with respect to the LTGs, which is well represented by the
relation log (SFR_FUV.CaF2) = 0.70xlog (SFR_{Ha})-1.26.The disk structure of
the FUV.CaF2 emitting populations discovered in all the ETGs implies
dissipative processes and wet merging events. The systematic discrepancy
between SFRs derived from Ha and FUV fluxes suggests that rejuvenation episodes
in ETGs cannot sustain constant SF over ~100 Myrs timescales.

task is framed as a binary classification problem. The second task is a
multi-class classification problem. We provide count-based and BERT-based

layer thickness, the dampinglike SOT efficiency reaches up to 0.3, which is
more than twice that expected from the Pt/Co bilayer. Moreover, the
magnetization can be easily switched by the injection of pulses with current
density of about 0.5-2*107A/cm2 despite the extremely high perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy barrier (up to 7.8 T). Efficient switching is due to the
combination of large SOTs and low saturation magnetization owing to the
ferrimagnetic character of the multilayers. We observed current-driven DW
motion in the absence of any external field, which is indicative of homochiral
N\'eel-type DWs stabilized by the interfacial Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction.

the best policy in hindsight. For such a problem, the nonstationary state
transitions due to the varying opponent pose a significant challenge. In light
of a recent hardness result \citep{liu2022learning}, we focus on the setting
where the opponent's previous policies are revealed to the agent for decision
making. With such an information structure, we propose a new algorithm,
\underline{D}ecentralized \underline{O}ptimistic hype\underline{R}policy
m\underline{I}rror de\underline{S}cent (DORIS), which achieves
$\sqrt{K}$-regret in the context of general function approximation, where $K$
is the number of episodes. Moreover, when all the agents adopt DORIS, we prove
that their mixture policy constitutes an approximate coarse correlated
equilibrium. In particular, DORIS maintains a \textit{hyperpolicy} which is a
distribution over the policy space. The hyperpolicy is updated via mirror
descent, where the update direction is obtained by an optimistic variant of
least-squares policy evaluation. Furthermore, to illustrate the power of our
method, we apply DORIS to constrained and vector-valued MDPs, which can be
formulated as zero-sum Markov games with a fictitious opponent.

detect differences in data distributions under different missingness

$\lambda_c$ of the electron-phonon coupling $\lambda$ regardless of the
underlying model Hamiltonian. The value of $\lambda_c$ is approximately between
3.0 and 3.7. The new phase that emerges at $\lambda>\lambda_c$ breaks the
lattice translational symmetry. Depending on the filling fraction and crystal
symmetry, it is an insulator or a Fermi liquid. Its characteristic feature is a
gap or a pronounced depression of the fermionic density of states near the
Fermi level. We establish the breakdown from within the Migdal-Eliashberg
theory by demonstrating that the normal state specific heat is negative for
$\lambda\ge 3.7$ and the quasiparticle lifetime vanishes in the strong coupling
limit. At fixed $\lambda>\lambda_c$, the transition to the new phase occurs at
a critical temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature.
In addition, there is a first order phase transition between the new phase and
the superconducting state as we vary $\lambda$ across $\lambda_c$ at fixed
temperature. We put forward a new theory - lattice-fermionic theory of
superfluidity - that bridges the gap between the Migdal-Eliashberg approach and
the physics at stronger coupling. At small $\lambda$, our theory reduces to the
Migdal-Eliashberg theory and, past $\lambda_c$, it describes the new phase and
a range of other phenomena.

photometric modulation amplitudes $R_\mathrm{per}$ for $\approx 4,000$ Sun-like
main-sequence stars observed by Kepler, using $P_\mathrm{rot}$ and
$R_\mathrm{per}$ from McQuillan et al. (2014), effective temperature
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ from LAMOST DR6, and parallax data from Gaia EDR3. As has been
suggested in previous works, we find that $P_\mathrm{rot}$ scaled by the
convective turnover time $\tau_\mathrm{c}$, or the Rossby number
$\mathrm{Ro}=P_\mathrm{rot}/\tau_\mathrm{c}$, serves as a good predictor of
$R_\mathrm{per}$: $R_\mathrm{per}$ plateaus around $1\%$ in relative flux for
$0.2 \lesssim \mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot \lesssim 0.4$, and decays steeply
with increasing $\mathrm{Ro}$ for $0.4 \lesssim \mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot
\lesssim 0.8$, where $\mathrm{Ro}_\odot$ denotes $\mathrm{Ro}$ of the Sun. In
the latter regime we find $\mathrm{d}\ln
R_\mathrm{per}/\mathrm{d}\ln\mathrm{Ro} \sim -4.5$ to $-2.5$, although the
value is sensitive to detection bias against weak modulation and may depend on
other parameters including $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and surface metallicity. The
existing X-ray and Ca II H&K flux data also show transitions at
$\mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot\sim 0.4$, suggesting that all these transitions
share the same physical origin. We also find that the rapid decrease of
$R_\mathrm{per}$ with increasing $\mathrm{Ro}$ causes rotational modulation of
fainter Kepler stars with $\mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot \gtrsim 0.6$ to be
buried under the photometric noise. This effect sets the longest
$P_\mathrm{rot}$ detected in the McQuillan et al. (2014) sample as a function
of $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and obscures the signature of stalled spin down that has
been proposed to set in around $\mathrm{Ro}/\mathrm{Ro}_\odot \sim 1$.

in-situ and remote ocean observations at the time of the predictions only.
Because observations are scarce and discontinuous in time and space, numerical
models are often unable to accurately model and predict real ocean dynamics,
leading to a lack of fulfillment of a range of services that require reliable
predictions at various temporal and spatial scales. The process of constraining
free numerical models with observations is known as data assimilation. The
primary objective is to minimize the misfit of model states with the
observations while respecting the rules of physics. The caveat of this approach
is that measurements are used only once, at the time of the prediction. The
information contained in the history of the measurements and its role in the
determinism of the prediction is, therefore, not accounted for. Consequently,
historical measurement cannot be used in real-time forecasting systems. The
research presented in this paper provides a novel approach rooted in artificial
intelligence to expand the usability of observations made before the time of
the prediction. Our approach is based on the re-purpose of an existing deep
learning model, called U-Net, designed specifically for image segmentation
analysis in the biomedical field. U-Net is used here to create a Transform
Model that retains the temporal and spatial evolution of the differences
between model and observations to produce a correction in the form of
regression weights that evolves spatially and temporally with the model both
forward and backward in time, beyond the observation period. Using virtual
observations, we show that the usability of the observation can be extended up
to a one year prior or post observations.

integer decision variables and uncertainty in the second-stage cost vector,
technology matrix, and the right-hand side vector. Such mixed-integer recourse
models are typically non-convex and thus hard to solve. There exist convex
approximations of these models with accompanying error bounds. However, it is
unclear how these error bounds depend on the distributions of the second-stage
cost vector $q$. In fact, the only error bound that is known hinges on the
assumption that $q$ has a finite support. In this paper, we derive parametric
error bounds whose dependence on the distribution of $q$ is explicit and that
hold for any distribution of $q$, provided it has a finite expected
$\ell_1$-norm. We find that the error bounds scale linearly in the expected
value of the $\ell_1$-norm of $q$.

related to the Born-Infeld action. This nonlinearity has been proven to be a
consequence of the partial ${\cal N}=2\to{\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry breaking,
originating from the solitonic nature of the branes. In this work, we focus on
the effective descriptions of D2-branes. Using the Goldstone multiplet
interpretation of the action and the method of nilpotent ${\cal N}=2$
superfields, we construct the 3D, ${\cal N}=1$ superspace effective action
which makes the first supersymmetry manifest and realizes the second,
spontaneously broken, supersymmetry nonlinearly. We show that there are two
such supersymmetric extensions of the 3D Born-Infeld action which correspond to
the dynamics of the 3D Maxwell-Goldstone multiplet and the 3D projection of the
Tensor-Goldstone multiplet respectively. Moreover, we demonstrate that these
results are derived by applying the constrained superfield approach on the
${\cal N}=2, D=3$ vector and chiral multiplets after expanding them around a
nontrivial vacuum. We find that these two descriptions are related by a duality
transformation which results in the inversion of a dimensionless parameter. For
both descriptions we derive the explicit bosonic and fermionic parts of the 3D
super Born-Infeld action. Finally, consider the deformation of the
Maxwell-Goldstone superspace action by the characteristic Chern-Simons-like,

predict the instantaneous velocity fields with detailed fluctuations and
reproduce the turbulence statistics as well as spatial and temporal spectra

and coherent vortex structures on the transfer of kinetic energy across scales
around the laminar flame thickness $\delta^0_\mathrm{L}$ in a turbulent
premixed swirl flame and a non-reacting swirl flow. High-resolution tomographic
particle image velocimetry and formaldehyde planar laser induced fluorescence
measurements are used to obtain 3D velocity fields and estimates of the
progress variable and density fields. The kinetic energy transfer across a
filter scale of $\Delta = 1.5 \delta^0_\mathrm{L}$ was then quantified using
physical space analysis. Coherent flow structures were identified using the
swirling strength and proper orthogonal decomposition was used to identify the
dominant periodic flow structure. While non-reacting regions of the flow show
mean down-scale energy transfer (forward-scatter), mean back-scatter is
observed internal to the flame. Importantly, the back-scatter magnitude in the
flame increases in regions undergoing flame/vortex interaction. That is, the
mean back-scatter magnitude at locations simultaneously inside the flame and a
large-scale coherent vortex is higher than regions in the flame and not in a
vortex, with the mean back-scatter magnitude increasing with the swirling
strength. This increased back-scatter may be due to locally higher heat release
rates in locations of flame/vortex interaction. Overall, the results
demonstrate the importance of kinetic energy back-scatter at scales around the
flame thickness and the complicated relationship between back-scatter and local
flame/flow structure; these results should be considered when modeling
turbulence in flames.

however strongly depend on the extent to which late time non-linearities erase

information remains in the bispectrum of the non-linear dark matter density
field by implementing a new, simulation-based, methodology for joint estimation
of PNG amplitudes ($f_{\rm NL}$) and standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters. The
estimator is based on optimally compressed statistics, which, for a given input
density field, combine power spectrum and modal bispectrum measurements, and
numerically evaluate their covariance and their response to changes in
cosmological parameters. We train and validate the estimator using a large
suite of N-body simulations (QUIJOTE-PNG), including different types of PNG
(local, equilateral, orthogonal). We explicitly test the estimator's
unbiasedness, optimality and stability with respect to changes in the total
number of input realizations. While the dark matter power spectrum itself
contains negligible PNG information, as expected, including it as an ancillary
statistic increases the PNG information content extracted from the bispectrum
by a factor of order $2$. As a result, we prove the capability of our approach
to optimally extract PNG information on non-linear scales beyond the

workflow in reinforcement learning (RL) research. However, RL systems, when
applied to large-scale settings, rarely operate tabula rasa. Such large-scale
systems undergo multiple design or algorithmic changes during their development
cycle and use ad hoc approaches for incorporating these changes without
re-training from scratch, which would have been prohibitively expensive.
Additionally, the inefficiency of deep RL typically excludes researchers
without access to industrial-scale resources from tackling
computationally-demanding problems. To address these issues, we present
reincarnating RL as an alternative workflow or class of problem settings, where
prior computational work (e.g., learned policies) is reused or transferred
between design iterations of an RL agent, or from one RL agent to another. As a
step towards enabling reincarnating RL from any agent to any other agent, we
focus on the specific setting of efficiently transferring an existing
sub-optimal policy to a standalone value-based RL agent. We find that existing
approaches fail in this setting and propose a simple algorithm to address their
limitations. Equipped with this algorithm, we demonstrate reincarnating RL's
gains over tabula rasa RL on Atari 2600 games, a challenging locomotion task,

according to chemical stimulus. A classical model for this phenomenon is a
kinetic equation that describes the velocity jump process whose
tumbling/transition kernel uniquely determines the effect of chemical stimulus
on bacteria. The model has been shown to be an accurate model that matches with
bacteria motion qualitatively. For a quantitative modeling, biophysicists and
practitioners are also highly interested in determining the explicit value of
the tumbling kernel. Due to the experimental limitations, measurements are
typically macroscopic in nature. Do macroscopic quantities contain enough
information to recover microscopic behavior? In this paper, we give a positive
answer. We show that when given a special design of initial data, the
population density, one specific macroscopic quantity as a function of time,
contains sufficient information to recover the tumbling kernel and its
associated damping coefficient. Moreover, we can read off the chemotaxis
tumbling kernel using the values of population density directly from this
specific experimental design. This theoretical result using kinetic theory
sheds light on how practitioners may conduct experiments in laboratories.

multistable under strong resonant or parametric drive, additional sets of
coexisting period-tripled states emerge in the lower mode. In the latter case,
we measure a total of 6 coexisting vibration states with identical amplitude

However, many off-the-shelf machine learning models, including artificial

Therefore, extra data preprocessing and curation steps, such as data
imputation, are inevitable before learning and prediction processes. In this
study, we propose a simple and intuitive yet effective method for pruning
missing values (PROMISSING) during learning and inference steps in neural
networks. In this method, there is no need to remove or impute the missing
values; instead, the missing values are treated as a new source of information
(representing what we do not know). Our experiments on simulated data, several
classification and regression benchmarks, and a multi-modal clinical dataset
show that PROMISSING results in similar prediction performance compared to
various imputation techniques. In addition, our experiments show models trained
using PROMISSING techniques are becoming less decisive in their predictions
when facing incomplete samples with many unknowns. This finding hopefully
advances machine learning models from being pure predicting machines to more
realistic thinkers that can also say ""I do not know"" when facing incomplete

impact loads, acoustic emissions, and atmospheric-ocean transfer, but detailed
simulations in all but the simplest settings are infeasible. An alternative
approach is to resolve only large scales, and model small scale bubbles
adopting sub-resolution closures. Here we introduce a large eddy simulation
(LES) Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme for simulations of bubbly
flows. The continuous liquid phase is resolved with a semi-implicit
isothermally compressible SPH framework. This is coupled with a discrete
Lagrangian bubble model. Bubbles and liquid interact via exchanges of volume
and momentum, through turbulent closures, bubble breakup and entrainment, and
free-surface interaction models. By representing bubbles as individual
particles, they can be tracked over their lifetimes, allowing closure models
for sub-resolution fluctuations, bubble deformation, breakup and free-surface
interaction in integral form, accounting for the finite timescales over which
these events occur. We investigate two flows: bubble plumes, and breaking
waves, and find close quantitative agreement with published experimental and
numerical data. In particular, for plunging breaking waves, our framework
accurately predicts the Hinze scale, bubble size distribution, and growth rate
of the entrained bubble population. This is the first coupling of an SPH
framework with a discrete bubble model, with potential for cost effective
simulations of wave-structure interactions and more accurate predictions of

  We prove that solving an instance of the considered problem class is

solution approach based on topological sorting and corresponding run time
complexities that are quadratic in the number of discretization intervals of
the underlying control problem, the main quantifier for the size of a problem

Specifically, the analysis of a Lagrangian relaxation yields a consistent

can be employed to accelerate the $A^*$ algorithm for the RCSPP without losing

reversible strain and offers a tempting prospect of controlling its

Here we use the self-rolled-up membrane platform for strain engineering and
integration of graphene with stressed dielectric thin films. Graphene rolls up
or down together with the stressed film upon releasing from the substrate and
the curvature of the rolled-up film stack enables the strain tuning of the
graphene monolayer. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the uniaxial
strain in rolled up graphene by quantifying the red shift and splitting of the
G peak in the doubly degenerate E2g optical mode. Approximately 5 percent
compressive strain is realized using a SRuM diameter of roughly 2 microns. By
reducing the diameter of the SRuM structure, even higher strain level can be
reached. The SRuM approach can also be readily applied to induce strain in
other materials beyond the level that can be achieved using conventional

aided by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). Specifically, we start
from the assumption that the position and orientation of a RIS can be viewed as
prior information for RIS-aided localization in wireless systems and derive
Bayesian bounds for the localization of a user equipment (UE). To do this, we
first derive the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (FIM) for geometric channel
parameters in order to derive the Bayesian localization bounds. Subsequently,
we show through the equivalent Fisher information matrix (EFIM) that all the
information provided by the RIS-related geometric channel parameters is
completely lost when the complex path gains are unknown. More specifically, in
the absence of channel knowledge, the EFIM of the RIS-related geometric channel
parameters is a zero matrix. This observation is crucial to parametric channel
estimation. It mandates that any parametric channel estimator must estimate the
complex path gains before estimating the RIS-related geometric channel
parameters. Furthermore, we note that because these RIS-related geometric
parameters are needed for localization, prior information about the complex
path gains must be available for feasible UE localization. We also show that
this FIM is decomposable into i) information provided by the transmitter, ii)
information provided by the RIS, and iii) information provided by the receiver.
We then transform the Bayesian EFIM for geometric channel parameters to the
Bayesian FIM for the UE position and orientation parameters and examine its
specific structure under a particular class of RIS reflection coefficients.
Finally, we show the effect of having a set of RISs with perturbed
position/orientation on localization performance through numerical results.

validation are an underestimated global problem. Particularly in automatic
biomedical image analysis, chosen performance metrics often do not reflect the
domain interest, thus failing to adequately measure scientific progress and
hindering translation of ML techniques into practice. To overcome this, our
large international expert consortium created Metrics Reloaded, a comprehensive
framework guiding researchers in the problem-aware selection of metrics.
Following the convergence of ML methodology across application domains, Metrics
Reloaded fosters the convergence of validation methodology. The framework was
developed in a multi-stage Delphi process and is based on the novel concept of
a problem fingerprint - a structured representation of the given problem that
captures all aspects that are relevant for metric selection, from the domain
interest to the properties of the target structure(s), data set and algorithm
output. Based on the problem fingerprint, users are guided through the process
of choosing and applying appropriate validation metrics while being made aware
of potential pitfalls. Metrics Reloaded targets image analysis problems that
can be interpreted as a classification task at image, object or pixel level,
namely image-level classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and
instance segmentation tasks. To improve the user experience, we implemented the
framework in the Metrics Reloaded online tool, which also provides a point of
access to explore weaknesses, strengths and specific recommendations for the
most common validation metrics. The broad applicability of our framework across
domains is demonstrated by an instantiation for various biological and medical
image analysis use cases.

attacks, and the adversarial robustness of DNNs could be improved by adding
adversarial noises to training data (e.g., the standard adversarial training
(SAT)). However, inappropriate noises added to training data may reduce a
model's performance, which is termed the trade-off between accuracy and
robustness. This problem has been sufficiently studied for the classification
of whole images but has rarely been explored for image analysis tasks in the
medical application domain, including image segmentation, landmark detection,
and object detection tasks. In this study, we show that, for those medical
image analysis tasks, the SAT method has a severe issue that limits its
practical use: it generates a fixed and unified level of noise for all training
samples for robust DNN training. A high noise level may lead to a large
reduction in model performance and a low noise level may not be effective in
improving robustness. To resolve this issue, we design an adaptive-margin
adversarial training (AMAT) method that generates sample-wise adaptive
adversarial noises for robust DNN training. In contrast to the existing,
classification-oriented adversarial training methods, our AMAT method uses a
loss-defined-margin strategy so that it can be applied to different tasks as
long as the loss functions are well-defined. We successfully apply our AMAT
method to state-of-the-art DNNs, using five publicly available datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate that: (1) our AMAT method can be applied to
the three seemingly different tasks in the medical image application domain;
(2) AMAT outperforms the SAT method in adversarial robustness; (3) AMAT has a
minimal reduction in prediction accuracy on clean data, compared with the SAT
method; and (4) AMAT has almost the same training time cost as SAT.

quantify fibrosis. Purpose: The aim of this study was to postulate a new
artificial intelligence method to identify fibrosis in cine cardiac magnetic
resonance (CMR) imaging. Methods: A retrospective observational study was
carried out in a population of 75 subjects from a clinical center of San Carlos
de Bariloche. The proposed method analyzes the myocardial texture in cine CMR
images using a convolutional neural network to determine local myocardial
tissue damage. Results: An accuracy of 89% for quantifying local tissue damage
was observed for the validation data set and 70% for the test set. In addition,
the qualitative analysis showed a high spatial correlation in lesion location.
Conclusions: The postulated method enables to spatially identify fibrosis using
only the information from cine nuclear magnetic resonance studies,
demonstrating the potential of this technique to quantify myocardial viability
in the future or to study the lesions etiology

We enhance the performance of image-based methods for category-agnostic object
pose estimation by exploiting 3D knowledge learned by a multi-modal method.
Specifically, we propose a novel contrastive knowledge distillation framework
that effectively transfers 3D-augmented image representation from a multi-modal

two-stage training procedure of knowledge distillation, which formulates an
advanced solution to combine these two approaches for cross-modal tasks. We
experimentally report state-of-the-art results compared with existing
category-agnostic image-based methods by a large margin (up to +5% improvement
on ObjectNet3D dataset), demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

algorithms is kernel flow, which was introduced in the context of
classification in machine learning. It can be seen as a cross-validation

incurred by removing some part of the dataset (typically half of it) is
minimized. A second class of algorithms is called spectral kernel ridge
regression, and aims at selecting a ""best"" kernel such that the norm of the

X-rays are used to capture the internal structure of objects. Methods such as
Computational Tomography use X-ray radiographs from hundreds of projections in
order to reconstruct a three dimensional model of the object. In experimental
environments, such as the National Ignition Facility and Omega-60, the
availability of these views is scarce and in many cases only consist of a
single line of sight. Mathematical reconstruction of a 3D object from sparse

solved by utilizing prior information. Neural networks have been used for the
task of 3D reconstruction as they are capable of encoding and leveraging this
prior information. We utilize half a dozen different convolutional neural
networks to produce different 3D representations of ICF implosions from the

problem in many domains including crowd-sourcing, multi-agent planning, sensor

The core question is how to aggregate signals from multiple sources (e.g.
experts) in order to reveal an underlying ground truth. While a full answer
depends on the type of signal, correlation of signals, and desired output, a
problem common to all of these applications is that of differentiating sources
based on their quality and weighting them accordingly. It is often assumed that
this differentiation and aggregation is done by a single, accurate central
mechanism or agent (e.g. judge). We complicate this model in two ways. First,
we investigate the setting with both a single judge, and one with multiple
judges. Second, given this multi-agent interaction of judges, we investigate
various constraints on the judges' reporting space. We build on known results
for the optimal weighting of experts and prove that an ensemble of sub-optimal
mechanisms can perform optimally under certain conditions. We then show
empirically that the ensemble approximates the performance of the optimal
mechanism under a broader range of conditions.

devoted to constructing some score functions, which can strictly distinguish
different intuitionistic fuzzy values (IFVs) and preserve the natural partial

namely the application of a single monotonous and continuous function does not
distinguish all IFVs. For the distance or similarity measure, some examples are
given to show that classical similarity measures based on the normalized
Euclidean distance and normalized Minkowski distance do not meet the axiomatic
definition of intuitionistic fuzzy similarity measures. Moreover,some
illustrative examples are given to show that classical intuitionistic fuzzy
TOPSIS methods do not ensure the monotonicity with the natural partial order or
linear orders, which may yield some counter-intuitive results. To overcome the
limitation of non-monotonicity, we propose a novel intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS

(LPs) with an extremely large number of variables (columns). CG is the
workhorse for tackling large-scale \textit{integer} linear programs, which rely
on CG to solve LP relaxations within a branch and price algorithm. Two
canonical applications are the Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) and Vehicle Routing
Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). In VRPTW, for example, each binary variable
represents the decision to include or exclude a \textit{route}, of which there
are exponentially many; CG incrementally grows the subset of columns being
used, ultimately converging to an optimal solution. We propose RLCG, the first
Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for CG. Unlike typical column selection
rules which myopically select a column based on local information at each
iteration, we treat CG as a sequential decision-making problem: the column
selected in a given iteration affects subsequent column selections. This
perspective lends itself to a Deep Reinforcement Learning approach that uses
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent the variable-constraint structure in
the LP of interest. We perform an extensive set of experiments using the
publicly available BPPLIB benchmark for CSP and Solomon benchmark for VRPTW.
RLCG converges faster and reduces the number of CG iterations by 22.4\% for CSP
and 40.9\% for VRPTW on average compared to a commonly used greedy policy. Our

of their progenitor stars has bothered astronomers for nearly 50 years. It has
been extensively argued that the high pulsar velocity should be acquired during
a natal kick process on a timescale of 100ms - 10s in the supernova explosion,
in which some asymmetrical dynamical mechanism plays a key role. However, a
satisfactory picture generally is still lacking. In this study, it is argued
that the neutrino rocket model can well account for the high speed as well as
the long-term evolution behaviors of pulsars. The neutrinos are emitted from
superfluid vortex neutrons through the neutrino cyclotron radiation mechanism.
The unique characters of left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos
resulting from the nonconservation of parity in weak interactions play a major
role in the spatial asymmetry. The continuous acceleration of pulsars can be
naturally explained by this model, which yields a maximum velocity surpassing
1000 km s$^{-1}$. The alignment between the spinning axis and the direction of
motion observed for the Crab pulsar (PSR 0531) and the Vela pulsar (PSR 0833)
can be well accounted for. The observed correlation between the spin-down rate
and the period of long-period pulsars with $P \gtrsim 0.5$s can also be
satisfactorily explained.

to learn new information without forgetting old knowledge (i.e., Catastrophic
Forgetting). Most existing CL approaches focus on finding solutions to preserve
acquired knowledge, so working on the past of the model. However, we argue that
as the model has to continually learn new tasks, it is also important to put
focus on the present knowledge that could improve following tasks learning. In
this paper we propose a new, simple, CL algorithm that focuses on solving the

specifically, our approach combines the main data stream with a secondary,
diverse and uncorrelated stream, from which the network can draw auxiliary

data may contain useful features for the current and the next tasks and
incoming task classes can be mapped onto auxiliary classes. Furthermore, the
addition of data to the current task is implicitly making the classifier more

algorithm to resolve concerns related to fairness, accountability,

does not imply its FATE-related issues cease to exist. In this paper, we
introduce the notion of the ""algorithmic imprint"" to illustrate how merely
removing an algorithm does not necessarily undo or mitigate its consequences.
We operationalize this concept and its implications through the 2020 events
surrounding the algorithmic grading of the General Certificate of Education
(GCE) Advanced (A) Level exams, an internationally recognized UK-based high
school diploma exam administered in over 160 countries. While the algorithmic
standardization was ultimately removed due to global protests, we show how the
removal failed to undo the algorithmic imprint on the sociotechnical
infrastructures that shape students', teachers', and parents' lives. These
events provide a rare chance to analyze the state of the world both with and
without algorithmic mediation. We situate our case study in Bangladesh to
illustrate how algorithms made in the Global North disproportionately impact
stakeholders in the Global South. Chronicling more than a year-long community
engagement consisting of 47 inter-views, we present the first coherent timeline
of ""what"" happened in Bangladesh, contextualizing ""why"" and ""how"" they happened
through the lenses of the algorithmic imprint and situated algorithmic
fairness. Analyzing these events, we highlight how the contours of the
algorithmic imprints can be inferred at the infrastructural, social, and
individual levels. We share conceptual and practical implications around how
imprint-awareness can (a) broaden the boundaries of how we think about
algorithmic impact, (b) inform how we design algorithms, and (c) guide us in AI

could be beneficial to the grid in terms of improved demand-supply management

understanding these behaviours. Some studies have used stated preference
surveys of non-EV owners or data collected from EV trials to estimate EV
driving and charging patterns. Other studies have tried to decipher EV owners'

the types of positive ions in the SW (according to experiments on the Prognozz

consisted of a shared online canvas of 1000 pixels by 1000 pixels co-edited by
over a million recorded users over 72 hours. In this paper, we designed and
compared two methods to analyze the dynamics of this experiment. Our first
method consisted in approximating the set of 2D cellular-automata-like rules

can switch due to structure changes following defect ionization: we call this
defect-level switching (DLS). For example, DX centers in III-V compounds, and
oxygen vacancies in ZnO, can switch between deep and shallow donor
configurations, and these bistable dynamics are responsible for persistent
photoconductivity. We recently demonstrated highly-nonlinear, hysteretic,
two-terminal electronic devices using DLS in CdS [H. Yin, A. Kumar, J.M.
LeBeau, and R. Jaramillo, Phys. Rev. Applied 15, 014014 (2021).] The resulting
devices operate without mass transport, and in the opposite sense to most
resistive switches: they are in a high-conductivity state at equilibrium, and
switch to a low-conductivity state at forward bias. Although DLS uses the same
defect transitions that are responsible for persistent photoconductivity, DLS
devices operate without light and can be orders-of-magnitude faster due to
exponential tuning of transition rates with voltage. In this work we use theory
and numerical simulation to explore the design space of DLS devices,
emphasizing the tradeoff between speed and on/off ratio. Our results will be

scheduling, and the user energy consumption minimization problem under
inference latency constraints is investigated. To deal with the coupled
offloading and scheduling introduced by concurrent batch processing, we first
consider an offline problem with a constant edge inference latency and the same

design constraints and the demands it places on the new materials and memory
devices that anchor the cross-bar architecture. In the second part, we review
what is knows about the different new non-volatile memory materials and devices
suited for compute in-memory, and discuss the outlook and challenges.

discrimination leading to potentially harmful societal impacts as a result of
biased outcomes. For example, part-of-speech taggers trained on Mainstream
American English (MAE) produce non-interpretable results when applied to
African American English (AAE) as a result of language features not seen during
training. In this work, we incorporate a human-in-the-loop paradigm to gain a
better understanding of AAE speakers' behavior and their language use, and
highlight the need for dialectal language inclusivity so that native AAE
speakers can extensively interact with NLP systems while reducing feelings of
disenfranchisement.

language models with application to the production of two types of learning
resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large
language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and
test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and
quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically
generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as
is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence
both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by
supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is
significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for
instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the
quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further
discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory
programming education and highlight future research streams that have the
potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both
teachers and students alike.

  Molecular Dynamics","G-Protein Coupled Receptors, LSTM, Molecular Dynamics",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are a big family of eukaryotic cell
transmembrane proteins, responsible for numerous biological processes. From a
practical viewpoint around 34\% of the drugs approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration target these receptors. They can be analyzed from their
simulated molecular dynamics, including the prediction of their behavior in the
presence of drugs. In this paper, the capability of Long Short-Term Memory
Networks (LSTMs) are evaluated to learn and predict the molecular dynamic
trajectories of a receptor. Several models were trained with the 3D position of
the amino acids of the receptor considering different transformations on the
position of the amino acid, such as their centers of mass, the geometric
centers and the position of the $\alpha$--carbon for each amino acid. The error
of the prediction of the position was evaluated by the mean average error (MAE)
and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). The LSTM models show a robust
performance, with results comparable to the state-of-the-art in non-dynamic 3D
predictions. The best MAE and RMSD values were found for the mass center of the
amino acids with 0.078 {\AA} and 0.156 {\AA} respectively. This work shows the
potential of LSTM to predict the molecular dynamics of GPRCs.

sustainable energy supply, allowing magnetic flux variation in response to
changes in applied magnetic field, at low energy loss1. The electrification of
transport, households and manufacturing leads to an increase in energy
consumption due to hysteresis losses2. Therefore, minimizing coercivity, which
scales these losses, is crucial3. Yet, meeting this target alone is not enough:
SMMs in electrical engines must withstand severe mechanical loads, i.e., the
alloys need high strength and ductility4. This is a fundamental design
challenge, as most methods that enhance strength introduce stress fields that
can pin magnetic domains, thus increasing coercivity and hysteretic losses5.
Here, we introduce an approach to overcome this dilemma. We have designed a
Fe-Co-Ni-Ta-Al multicomponent alloy with ferromagnetic matrix and paramagnetic
coherent nanoparticles (~91 nm size, ~55% volume fraction). They impede
dislocation motion, enhancing strength and ductility. Their small size, low
coherency and small magnetostatic energy create an interaction volume below the
magnetic domain wall width, leading to minimal domain wall pinning, thus
maintaining the soft magnetic properties. The alloy has a tensile strength of
1336 MPa at 54% tensile elongation, extremely low coercivity of 78 A/m (<1 Oe),
moderate saturation magnetization of 100 Am2/kg, and high electrical
resistivity of 103 {\mu}{\Omega} u Ohm cm.

To our knowledge, no existing equality saturation framework allows such an
optimization. The challenge with concurrent environments is that they require
non-local reasoning since parallel computations are inherently unrelated and
disjoint. This submission presents a new approach to optimizing equivalent
concurrent computations: extending e-graphs to capture equal concurrent
computations in order to replace them with a single computation.
