Exploiting control barrier functions, the robot is made aware of its (dynamic)

particle physics. Within our model baryogenesis, neutrino mass, strong CP and
dark matter puzzles are related. The common ingredient in connecting these
puzzles is the Kalb-Ramond field, a two form present in the gravitational
multiplet in the theory of closed strings. Leptons are fermions which we need
to couple to gravitational degrees of freedom using a vierbein formalism. The
presence of torsion provided by a Kalb-Ramond background leads us to firstly an
effective model involving the Einstein-Cartan formulation of gravity, a gauge
theory, in which coupling to fermions is via a covariant derivative and
secondly to a mechanism for CPT violation. This picture emerges from a low
energy string effective action obtained from a closed bosonic string theory
after compactification to four dimensions. The Kalb-Ramond field in four
dimensions can be identified with a pseudoscalar gravitational axion. Because
of the presence of an axial anomaly this axion can couple with the gluon field,
and in this way allows a connection with the strong CP problem and axionic dark
matter.

not require any distributional assumptions. In this paper, we explore the
possibility of conducting variable selection via Bayesian empirical likelihood.
We show theoretically that when the prior distribution satisfies certain mild
conditions, the corresponding Bayesian empirical likelihood estimators are
posteriorly consistent and variable selection consistent. As special cases, we
show the prior of Bayesian empirical likelihood LASSO and SCAD satisfies such
conditions and thus can identify the non-zero elements of the parameters with
probability tending to 1. In addition, it is easy to verify that those
conditions are met for other widely used priors such as ridge, elastic net and
adaptive LASSO. Empirical likelihood depends on a parameter that needs to be
obtained by numerically solving a non-linear equation. Thus, there exists no
conjugate prior for the posterior distribution, which causes the slow
convergence of the MCMC sampling algorithm in some cases. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel approach, which uses an approximation distribution
as the proposal. The computational results demonstrate quick convergence for
the examples used in the paper. We use both simulation and real data analyses
to illustrate the advantages of the proposed methods.

{\zeta}, quantifying the coordination shells separation, and find two

High-{\zeta} molecules have a tetrahedral arrangement, with four hydrogen

Low-{\zeta} molecules are less connected, partially merging the first and the
second shells. The appearance of isosbestic points in the radial distribution
functions and the collective density fluctuations at different length scales
and timescales reveal that the two-state model, consistent with available
experimental data for supercooled water, also holds under ambient conditions,
as we confirm by analyzing the vibrational spectrum of both types of water
molecules. Significant consequences of the structural differences between the
two states are that High-{\zeta} molecules have a dipole moment 6 % higher than
Low-{\zeta}. At the same time, Low-{\zeta} structures are more disordered and
with more significant angular fluctuations. These differences are also
reflected in the dynamics under ambient conditions. The Low-{\zeta} molecules

compact star-bursting cores with properties consistent with forming galaxy
bulges, embedded at the center of extended, massive stellar disks.
Surprisingly, the stellar disks are unambiguously both quiescent, and severely
lopsided. Therefore, `outside-in' quenching is ongoing in the three group
galaxies. We propose an overall scenario in which the strong mass lopsidedness
in the disks (ranging from factors of 1.6 to $>$3), likely generated under the
effects of accreted gas and clumps, is responsible for their star-formation
suppression, while funnelling gas into the nuclei and thus creating the central
starbursts. The lopsided side of the disks marks the location of accretion
streams impact, with additional matter components (dust and stars) detected in
their close proximity directly tracing the inflow direction. The interaction
with the accreted clumps, which can be regarded as minor-mergers, leads the
major axes of the three galaxies to be closely aligned with the outer
Lyman-$\alpha$-emitting feeding filaments. These results provide the first
observational evidence of the impact of cold accretion streams on the formation
and evolution of the galaxies they feed. In the current phase, this is taking
the form of the rapid buildup of bulges under the effects of accretion, while
still preserving massive quiescent and lopsided stellar disks at least until

proportional to the cool gas emission measure. Instead of assuming a turn-on
radius for the hot gas (as appropriate for the line-deshadowing instability
internal to the wind), we parametrize the hot gas in terms of a mean-free path
for accelerated low-density gas to encounter slower high-density material. This
alternative model is equally successful as previous approaches at fitting X-ray
spectral lines in the 5 -- 17 \AA\ wavelength range. We find that the
characteristic radii where the hottest gas appears is inversely proportional to
line formation temperature, suggesting that stronger shocks appear generally
closer to the surface. This picture is more consistent with pockets of
low-density, rapid acceleration at the lower boundary than with an internally
generated wind instability. We also infer an overall wind mass-loss rate from
the profile shapes with a technique used previously in the literature. In doing
so, we find evidence that the mass-loss rate derived from X-ray wind line
profiles is not robust with respect to changes in the specific heating picture

to the cubic crystal-field limit and result in dramatically decreasing hoppings

opening a gap with four electrons occupying the $j_{\rm eff} = 3/2$ orbitals.
Furthermore, the hybridization between the Os $5d$ orbitals and the $X$ ($X$ =
F, Cl, and Br) $p$ orbitals increases from F to Br, leading the electrons in
K$_2$OsF$_6$ to be more localized than in K$_2$OsCl$_6$ and K$_2$OsBr$_6$,
resulting in a smaller bandwidth for K$_2$OsF$_6$ than in the Cl- or Br- cases.

Similarly, the non-equilibrium dynamics can be analysed by using the dynamical
version of the cavity method. It is well known, however, that when
self-interactions are present, direct application of the dynamical cavity
method is cumbersome, due to the presence of strong memory effects, which
prevent explicit analysis of the dynamics beyond a few time steps. To overcome
this difficulty, we show that it is possible to map a system of $N$ variables

substantial technical advancement allows for the study of transient and
long-time behaviour of systems with self-interactions. Finally, we study the
dynamics of systems with multi-node interactions, recently used to model gene
regulatory networks, by mapping this to a bipartite system of Boolean variables

software carbon intensity to users is a fundamental stepping stone towards
minimizing emissions. In this paper, we provide a framework for measuring
software carbon intensity, and propose to measure operational carbon emissions
by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy
unit. We provide measurements of operational software carbon intensity for a
set of modern models for natural language processing and computer vision, and a
wide range of model sizes, including pretraining of a 6.1 billion parameter
language model. We then evaluate a suite of approaches for reducing emissions
on the Microsoft Azure cloud compute platform: using cloud instances in
different geographic regions, using cloud instances at different times of day,
and dynamically pausing cloud instances when the marginal carbon intensity is
above a certain threshold. We confirm previous results that the geographic
region of the data center plays a significant role in the carbon intensity for
a given cloud instance, and find that choosing an appropriate region can have
the largest operational emissions reduction impact. We also show that the time
of day has notable impact on operational software carbon intensity. Finally, we
conclude with recommendations for how machine learning practitioners can use

the increased concordance in wavelength between telluric lines and stellar

usually suffer from the so-called missing-cone problem that results in an
elongation of the final reconstruction along the optical axis. Different
iterative schemes have been proposed to solve the missing cone problem relying
on physical forward models and an error function that aims at filling in the
k-space and thus eliminating the missing-cone problem and reaching better
reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a different approach where a
3D neural network (NN) is employed. The NN is trained with a cost function
derived from a physical model based on the physics of optical wave propagation.
The 3D NN starts with an initial guess for the 3D RI reconstruction (i.e. Born,

of the reprocessed emission from the innermost region of the accretion disk, or
Comptonization from an optically thick and warm region called the 'warm
corona', in which electron scattering is the dominant source of opacity. To
constrain the origin of the soft excess in the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 926, we
carry out an multi-epoch X-ray spectral study using observations from Suzaku
(2009), XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (2016), and NuSTAR and Swift-XRT (2021). The
broadband X-ray spectra of Mrk 926 contains: a thermally Comptonized primary
continuum, a variable soft excess, and distant reflection. We find that in Mrk
926 as in so many sources, it is difficult to make a definite statement as to
what is causing the observed soft excess. A warm coronal-like component is
slightly preferred by the data but a reflection origin is also possible. Using
archival radio data, we detect an optically-thin radio component in our

and to understand how emotions manifest in language. An observation for NLP is
that emotions can be communicated implicitly by referring to events, appealing
to an empathetic, intersubjective understanding of events, even without
explicitly mentioning an emotion name. In psychology, the class of emotion
theories known as appraisal theories aims at explaining the link between events
and emotions. Appraisals can be formalized as variables that measure a
cognitive evaluation by people living through an event that they consider
relevant. They include the assessment if an event is novel, if the person
considers themselves to be responsible, if it is in line with the own goals,
and many others. Such appraisals explain which emotions are developed based on
an event, e.g., that a novel situation can induce surprise or one with
uncertain consequences could evoke fear. We analyze the suitability of
appraisal theories for emotion analysis in text with the goal of understanding
if appraisal concepts can reliably be reconstructed by annotators, if they can
be predicted by text classifiers, and if appraisal concepts help to identify
emotion categories. To achieve that, we compile a corpus by asking people to
textually describe events that triggered particular emotions and to disclose
their appraisals. Then, we ask readers to reconstruct emotions and appraisals
from the text. This setup allows us to measure if emotions and appraisals can
be recovered purely from text and provides a human baseline. Our comparison of
text classification methods to human annotators shows that both can reliably
detect emotions and appraisals with similar performance. Therefore, appraisals
constitute an alternative computational emotion analysis paradigm and further
improve the categorization of emotions in text with joint models.

tasks using deep learning. This paper addresses the problem of code generation
where the goal is to generate target code given source code in a different

learning models for code generation use training strategies primarily designed
for natural language. However, understanding and generating code requires a
more rigorous comprehension of the code syntax and semantics. With this
motivation, we develop an encoder-decoder Transformer model where both the
encoder and decoder are explicitly trained to recognize the syntax and data
flow in the source and target codes, respectively. We not only make the encoder
structure-aware by leveraging the source code's syntax tree and data flow
graph, but we also support the decoder in preserving the syntax and data flow
of the target code by introducing two novel auxiliary tasks: AST (Abstract
Syntax Tree) paths prediction and data flow prediction. To the best of our

decoder that models both syntax and data flow to enhance the quality of

advertising systems. Advertisers employ bidding strategies in RTB to optimize
their advertising effects subject to various financial requirements, especially
the return-on-investment (ROI) constraint. ROIs change non-monotonically during
the sequential bidding process, and often induce a see-saw effect between
constraint satisfaction and objective optimization. While some existing
approaches show promising results in static or mildly changing ad markets, they
fail to generalize to highly dynamic ad markets with ROI constraints, due to
their inability to adaptively balance constraints and objectives amidst
non-stationarity and partial observability. In this work, we specialize in
ROI-Constrained Bidding in non-stationary markets. Based on a Partially
Observable Constrained Markov Decision Process, our method exploits an
indicator-augmented reward function free of extra trade-off parameters and
develops a Curriculum-Guided Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (CBRL) framework
to adaptively control the constraint-objective trade-off in non-stationary ad
markets. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset with two
problem settings reveal that CBRL generalizes well in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution data regimes, and enjoys superior learning efficiency and
stability.

observed for light beams back in 1801 by Thomas Young. The maximum visibility
fringes occur when the irradiance of the two beams is equal, and as the ratio
of the beam intensities deviates from unity, fringe visibility decreases. An
interesting outcome that might not be entirely intuitive, however, is that the
wavefront of such unequal amplitude beams' superposition will exhibit a wavy
behavior. In this work, we experimentally observe the backflow phenomenon
within this wavy wavefront. Backflow appears in both optics (retro-propagating
light) and in quantum mechanics where a local phase gradient is not present
within the spectrum of the system. It has become an interesting subject for
applications as it is closely related to superoscillations whose features are
used in super resolution imaging and in a particle's path manipulations. The
first successful attempt to observe backflow was made only recently in an
assembly of optical fields, by synthesizing their wavefront in a complex
manner. Yet, backflow is perceived as hard to detect. Here, by utilizing
interference in its most basic form, we reveal that backflow in optical fields
is robust and surprisingly common, more than it was previously thought to be.

continuous path on the unit hypersphere via a sequence of local unitary gates,

dispersion measurements to constrain models for halo mass and particle mass.
The posterior likelihood is multimodal. Particle masses of order $m\sim
10^{-22} {\rm{eV}}$ require halos of mass in excess of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$,
while particle mass of order $m \gtrsim 10^{-20}{\rm{eV}}$ are favored by halos
of mass $\sim [10^{8} - 10^{9}] M_\odot$, with a similar behavior to cold dark
matter. Regardless of particle mass, the lower halo masses are allowed if
stellar dynamics are influenced by the presence of a central black hole of mass
at most $\sim 10^{-2}$ the host halo mass. We find no preference for models
that contain a black hole over models that do not contain a black hole. Our
main conclusion is that either the fuzzy dark matter particle mass must be $m
\gtrsim 10^{-20}$ eV, or the Milky Way dwarfs must be unusually heavy given the
expected hierarchical assembly of the Milky Way, or the Milky Way dwarfs must
contain a central black hole. We find no evidence for either of the last two

represent some of the most intractable puzzles in nature. The computational
challenge in these systems arises when interactions become comparable to other
energy scales, which makes the state of each particle depend on all other
particles. The lack of general solutions for the 3-body problem and acceptable
theory for strongly correlated electrons shows that our understanding of
correlated systems fades when the particle number or the interaction strength
increases. One of the hallmarks of interacting systems is the formation of
multi-particle bound states. In a ring of 24 superconducting qubits, we develop
a high fidelity parameterizable fSim gate that we use to implement the periodic
quantum circuit of the spin-1/2 XXZ model, an archetypal model of interaction.
By placing microwave photons in adjacent qubit sites, we study the propagation
of these excitations and observe their bound nature for up to 5 photons. We
devise a phase sensitive method for constructing the few-body spectrum of the
bound states and extract their pseudo-charge by introducing a synthetic flux.
By introducing interactions between the ring and additional qubits, we observe
an unexpected resilience of the bound states to integrability breaking. This
finding goes against the common wisdom that bound states in non-integrable
systems are unstable when their energies overlap with the continuum spectrum.
Our work provides experimental evidence for bound states of interacting photons
and discovers their stability beyond the integrability limit.

Constraint Learning (ACOL) algorithm. We provide an instance-dependent lower
bound for constrained linear best-arm identification and show that ACOL's
sample complexity matches the lower bound in the worst-case. In the average
case, ACOL's sample complexity bound is still significantly tighter than bounds
of simpler approaches. In synthetic experiments, ACOL performs on par with an
oracle solution and outperforms a range of baselines. As an application, we
consider learning constraints to represent human preferences in a driving
simulation. ACOL is significantly more sample efficient than alternatives for
this application. Further, we find that learning preferences as constraints is
more robust to changes in the driving scenario than encoding the preferences
directly in the reward function.

  We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$
for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that
generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero
pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve
list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a
random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list
decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most
$\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.

novel method to generate causal and yet interpretable counterfactual
explanations for image classifiers using pretrained generative models without
any re-training or conditioning. The generative models in this technique are
not bound to be trained on the same data as the target classifier. We use this
framework to obtain contrastive and causal sufficiency and necessity scores as
global explanations for black-box classifiers. On the task of face attribute
classification, we show how different attributes influence the classifier
output by providing both causal and contrastive feature attributions, and the
corresponding counterfactual images.

nonequilibrium phase transitions and their responses. In particular, for a
periodically driven system, its dynamics are described in terms of the
multi-dimensional Floquet lattice with a lattice size depending on number of
driving frequencies and their rational or irrational ratio. So far, for a
multi-frequency driving system, the energy pumping between the sources of
frequencies has been widely discussed as a signature of topologically
nontrivial Floquet bands. However, the unique edge modes emerging in the
Floquet lattice has not been explored yet. Here, we discuss how the edge modes
in the Floquet lattice are controlled and result in the localization at
particular frequencies, when multiple frequencies are present and their
magnitudes are commensurate values. First, we construct the minimal model to
exemplify our argument, focusing on a two-level system with two driving
frequencies. For strong frequency limit, one can describe the system as a
quasi-one dimensional Floquet lattice where the effective hopping between the
neighboring sites depends on the relative magnitudes of potential for two
frequency modes. With multiple driving modes, there always exist the
non-trivial Floquet lattice boundaries via controlling the frequencies and this
gives rise to the states that are mostly localized at such Floquet lattice
boundaries, i.e. particular frequencies. We suggest the time-dependent Creutz
ladder model as a realization of our theoretical Hamiltonian and show the
emergence of controllable Floquet edge modes.

non-collinear magnetic orders and topological magnons that have been overlooked
in the previous theoretical and experimental studies. As a function of the
twist angle, the collinear magnetic order undergoes the phase transitions to
the non-collinear order and the magnetic domain phase. In the magnetic domain
phase, we find that the spatially varying interlayer coupling produces the
magnetic skyrmions even in the absence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya

phase transitions by constructing the field theoretical model of the moire

observed in the numerical simulations. Finally, we classify the topological
properties of the magnon excitations. The magnons in each phases are
characterized by the distinct mass gaps with different physical origins. In the
collinear ferromagnetic order, the higher-order topological magnonic insulator
phase occurs. It serves as a unique example of the higher-order topological
phase in magnonic system, since it does not require non-collinear order or
asymmetric form of the interactions. In the magnetic domain phases, the magnons
are localized along the domain wall and form one-dimensional topological edge
mode. As the closed domain walls deform to a open network, the confined edge
mode extends to form a network model of the topological magnons.

unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$, output $\widehat{\rho}$
which is close to $\rho$ in some sense, e.g. trace distance or fidelity. When
one is allowed to make coherent measurements entangled across all copies,
$\Theta(d^2/\epsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient to get trace
distance $\epsilon$. Unfortunately, the protocols achieving this rate incur
large quantum memory overheads that preclude implementation on near-term
devices. On the other hand, the best known protocol using incoherent
(single-copy) measurements uses $O(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ copies, and multiple papers
have posed it as an open question to understand whether or not this rate is
tight. In this work, we fully resolve this question, by showing that any
protocol using incoherent measurements, even if they are chosen adaptively,
requires $\Omega(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ copies, matching the best known upper bound.
  We do so by a new proof technique which directly bounds the ``tilt'' of the
posterior distribution after measurements, which yields a surprisingly short
proof of our lower bound, and which we believe may be of independent interest.
  While this implies that adaptivity does not help for tomography with respect
to trace distance, we show that it actually does help for tomography with
respect to infidelity. We give an adaptive algorithm that outputs a state which
is $\gamma$-close in infidelity to $\rho$ using only $\tilde{O}(d^3/\gamma)$
copies, which is optimal for incoherent measurements. In contrast, it is known
that any nonadaptive algorithm requires $\Omega(d^3/\gamma^2)$ copies. While it
is folklore that in $2$ dimensions, one can achieve a scaling of $O(1/\gamma)$,
to the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first to achieve the optimal
rate in all dimensions.

present ProActive, a neural marked temporal point process (MTPP) framework for
modeling the continuous-time distribution of actions in an activity sequence

how torques impact the detected gravitational wave (GW) waveform in the

separation is within a few hundred Schwarzschild radii. For a sub-Eddington
accretion disc with a viscosity coefficient $\alpha=0.01$, surface density
$\Sigma\approx10^5$ g cm$^{-2}$, and Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm

Depending on the torque's strength, LISA will observe dephasing in the IMBHB's
GW signal up to either $z\sim5$ for high mass ratios ($q\approx0.1$) or to
$z\sim7$ for $q\approx10^{-3}$. We study the dependence of the measurable
dephasing on variations of BH masses, redshift, and accretion rates. Our
results suggest that phase shift is detectable even in high-redshift ($z = 10$)
binaries, provided that they experience super-Eddington accretion episodes. We
investigate if the disc-driven torques can result in an observable
`time-dependent' chirp mass with a simplified Fisher formalism, finding that,
at the expected signal-to-noise ratio, the gas-induced variation of the chirp
mass is too small to be detected. This work shows how perturbations of vacuum
waveforms induced by gas should be strong enough to be detected by LISA for the
IMBHB in the early inspiral phase. These perturbations encode precious
information on the astrophysics of accretion discs and galactic nuclei.
High-accuracy waveform models which incorporate these effects will be needed to

SFHs and low star-formation rates
(log$_{10}$(SFR(SED)/$M_{\odot}/\rm{yr}^{-1}$) $<$ 1.0) compared to their past
averages. The best-fit model SEDs show elevated H$\delta_{\rm{A}}$ values for
both galaxies, indicating that their stellar spectra are dominated by A-type
stars, and that star formation peaked $\sim0.5-1$ Gyr ago and has recently
declined. Additionally, based on SED fitting both merging galaxies turned on
and shut off star formation within a few hundred Myr of each other, suggesting
that their bursts of star formation may be linked. Combining the SFHs and
H$\delta_{\rm{A}}$ results with recent galaxy merger simulations, we infer that
these galaxies have recently completed their first pericentric passage and are
moving apart. Finally, the relatively low second velocity moment of GOODS-S

observational window into the acceleration mechanisms of extreme astrophysical
environments. One of the major challenges at Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes
(IACTs) designed to look for VHE gamma rays, is the separation of air showers
initiated by CCRs which form a background to gamma ray searches. Two other less
well studied problems at IACTs are a) the classification of different primary
nuclei among the CCR events and b) identification of anomalous events initiated
by Beyond Standard Model particles that could give rise to shower signatures
which differ from the standard images of either gamma rays or CCR showers. The
problems of categorizing the primary particle that initiates a shower image, or
the problem of tagging anomalous shower events in a model independent way, are
problems that are well suited to a machine learning (ML) approach. Traditional
studies that have explored gamma ray/CCR separation have used a multivariate
analysis based on derived shower properties, which contains significantly
reduced information about the shower. In our work, we address the problems
outlined above by using ML architectures trained on full simulated shower
images, as opposed to training on just a few derived shower properties. We
illustrate the techniques of binary and multi-category classification using
convolutional neural networks, and we also pioneer the use of autoencoders for
anomaly detection at VHE gamma ray experiments. As a case study, we apply our
techniques to the H.E.S.S. experiment. However, the real strength of the
techniques that we broach here in the context of VHE gamma ray observatories,
is that these methods can be applied broadly to any other IACT, such as the
upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), or can even be suitably adapted to
CCR experiments.

cosmological and particle physics problems, suggest that dark matter might
experience long-distance interactions mediated by an unbroken dark $U(1)$ gauge
symmetry, hence foreseeing the existence of a massless dark photon. Contrary to
the massive dark photon, a massless dark photon can only couple to the standard
model sector by means of effective higher dimensional operators. Massless
dark-photon production at colliders will then in general be suppressed at low
energy by a UV energy scale, which is of the order of the masses of portal
(messenger) fields connecting the dark and the observable sectors. A violation
of this expectation is provided by dark-photon production mediated by the Higgs
boson, thanks to the non-decoupling Higgs properties. Higgs-boson production at
colliders, followed by the Higgs decay into a photon and a dark photon,
provides then a very promising production mechanism for the dark photon
discovery, being insensitive in particular regimes to the UV scale of the new
physics. This decay channel gives rise to a peculiar signature characterized by
a monochromatic photon with energy half the Higgs mass (in the Higgs rest
frame) plus missing energy. We show how such resonant
photon-plus-missing-energy signature can uniquely be connected to a dark photon
production. Higgs boson production and decay into a photon and a dark photon as
a source of dark photons is reviewed at the Large Hadron Collider, in the light
of the present bounds on the corresponding signature by the CMS and ATLAS
collaborations. Perspectives for the dark-photon production in Higgs-mediated
processes at future $e^+e^-$ colliders are also discussed.

the signs of its inverse decay length. Analytically, trivial and non-trivial

protoneutron star (PNS) evolution ($\gtrsim1\,{\rm s}$ after core bounce) is
crucial, since approximately 50% of the energy liberated by neutrinos is
emitted during the cooling phase. We model the cooling phase with a hybrid
method by combining the neutrino emission predicted by 3D hydrodynamic
simulations with several cooling-phase estimates, including a novel
two-parameter correlation depending on the final baryonic PNS mass and the time
of shock revival. We find that the predicted DSNB event rate at
Super-Kamiokande can vary by a factor of $\sim2-3$ depending on the

measurements and to ensure high signal-to-noise for the study. Using the
cleaned catalogues, we investigate how velocity dispersion $\sigma$ changes
with stellar mass $m$. We fit two functional forms: the first, a classic
power-law of the form $\sigma \propto m^{-\eta}$ where $\eta$ is the degree of
energy equipartition, and the second from Bianchini et al. (2016) parameterised
by an equipartition mass $m_{eq}$ where $\eta$ changes with stellar mass. We
find that both functions fit well but cannot distinguish with statistical
significance which function provides the best fit. All clusters exhibit varying
degrees of partial equipartition; no cluster is at or near full equipartition.
We search for correlations of $\eta$ and $m_{eq}$ with various cluster
properties. The most significant correlation is observed with the number of
core or median relaxation times ($N_{core}$ or $N_{half}$) the cluster has
experienced. Finally, we determine the radial equipartition profile for each
cluster, that is, how the degree of equipartition changes with projected
distance from the cluster centre. We do not detect statistically significant
trends in the degree of equipartition with radius. Overall, our observational
findings are in broad agreement with theoretical predictions from N-body models
published in recent years.

formation for mid-infrared AGN fractions $\lesssim0.3$. With the corrected [O
IV] luminosity, we calculate black hole accretion rates ranging from $10^{-5}$
M$_{\odot}$/yr at low AGN fractions to 0.2 M$_{\odot}$/yr at the highest AGN

star formation, can lead to an overestimate of the BHAR by up to a factor of 30

intervening system at $z=5.67$. The variability properties of J1641+3755 can be
due to intrinsic variations of the accretion rate, a small-scale obscuration
event, gravitational lensing due to an intervening object, or an unrelated
X-ray transient in a foreground galaxy in 2018. Accounting for all of the $z>6$
QSOs with multiple X-ray observations separated by $>10$ rest-frame days, we
found an enhancement of strongly (i.e., by a factor $>3$) X-ray variable
objects compared to QSOs at later cosmic times. This finding may be related to
the physics of fast accretion in high-redshift QSOs.

populations and disks that develop a strong bar. Furthermore, we study stellar
migration from the perspective of the change of the galactocentric radius

particles between given time intervals. We find that stars migrate
approximately as a diffusion process only in the outer parts of the disks and

slower-than-diffusion. Finally, we give parametrisations that encapsulate the

perfecting the 3D surface model by repositioning its vertices so that it is
coherent with a set of observed images of the object. The textural artifacts
and incoherence with images are due to the non-planarity of a surface patch

Image areas from the viewpoints are used to represent texture for the patch in
Eigenspace. The Eigenspace representation captures variations of texture, which

face textures reconstructed from Eigenspace and the actual images is used to
reposition the vertices so that the model is improved or faired. We refer to
this technique of model refinement as EigenFairing, by which the model is

thermalization within a charge sector -- in a microcanonical subspace. But
quantum systems can have charges that fail to commute with each other and so
share no eigenbasis; microcanonical subspaces may not exist. Furthermore, the
Hamiltonian will have degeneracies, so the ETH need not imply thermalization.
We adapt the ETH to noncommuting charges by positing a non-Abelian ETH and
invoking the approximate microcanonical subspace introduced in quantum

In many cases, we prove, the time average thermalizes. However, we also find
cases in which, under a physically reasonable assumption, the time average

  Increasing Legibility, Public Acceptance and Trust",,,,,"cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vehicle pedestrian communication is extremely important when developing
autonomy for an autonomous vehicle. Enabling bidirectional nonverbal
communication between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles will lead to an
improvement of pedestrians' safety in autonomous driving. If a pedestrian wants
to communicate, the autonomous vehicle should provide feedback to the human
about what it is about to do. The user study presented in this paper
investigated several possible options for an external vehicle display for
effective nonverbal communication between an autonomous vehicle and a human.
The result of this study will guide the development of the feedback module in
future studies, optimizing for public acceptance and trust in the autonomous
vehicle's decision while being legible to the widest range of potential users.
The results of this study show that participants prefer symbols over text,
lights and road projection. Additionally, participants prefer the combination
of symbols and text as interaction modes to be displayed if the autonomous
vehicle is not driving. Further, the results show that the text interaction
mode option ""Safe to cross"" should be used combined with the symbol interaction
mode option that displays a symbol of a walking person. We plan to elaborate
and focus on the selected interaction modes via Virtual Reality and in the real
world in ongoing and future studies.

powerful tool to directly investigate the gravitational potentials within

spectroscopic galaxy and galaxy cluster samples extracted from the latest
releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to derive new constraints on
the gravity theory. We consider a spectroscopic sample of $3058$ galaxy
clusters, with a maximum redshift of $0.5$. We analyse the velocity
distribution of the cluster member galaxies to make new measurements of the
gravitational redshift effect inside galaxy clusters. We accurately estimate
the cluster centres, computing them as the average of angular positions and
redshifts of the closest galaxies to the brightest cluster galaxies. We find
that this centre definition provides a better estimation of the centre of the
cluster gravitational potential wells, relative to simply assuming the
brightest cluster galaxies as the cluster centres, as done in the past
literature. We compare our measurements with the theoretical predictions of
three different gravity theories: general relativity (GR), the $f(R)$ model,
and the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. A new statistical procedure is
used to fit the measured gravitational redshift signal and thus to discriminate
among the considered gravity theories. Finally, we investigate the systematic
uncertainties possibly affecting the analysis. We clearly detect the
gravitational redshift effect in the exploited cluster member catalogue. We
recover an integrated gravitational redshift signal of $-11.4 \pm 3.3$ km
s$^{-1}$, which is in agreement, within the errors, with past literature works.
Overall, our results are consistent with both GR and DGP predictions, while
they are in marginal disagreement with the predictions of the considered $f(R)$

finding that stellar masses are largely insensitive to the model, but the
inferred ages can vary by an order of magnitude. We infer a distribution of

$\sim30-70$ Myr depending on SED model. We quantify the fractions of $\leq10$
Myr and $\geq250$ Myr galaxies, finding that these systems comprise $\sim15-30$

flexible SFH model, the shapes of the SFHs are consistent with those implied by

stellar masses can differ significantly, with those of young systems sometimes
being more than an order of magnitude larger with the flexible SFH. We quantify
the implications of these results for $z\gtrsim9$ stellar mass assembly and

momentum toward the wall for the Euler solution, and show that wall friction
and pressure are obtained from this momentum flux in the limit of vanishing
distance to the wall, for the wall-parallel and wall-normal components,

in a neighborhood of the wall and if also the essential supremum of wall-normal
velocity within a small distance of the wall vanishes with this distance (a
precise form of the non-flow-through condition). In the latter case, all of the
limiting drag arises from pressure forces acting on the body and the pressure
at the body surface can be obtained as the limit approaching the wall of the

power dissipated by drag to the flux of vorticity across the flow lines of the
potential Euler solution considered by d'Alembert. Its derivation involves a
decomposition of the velocity field into this background potential-flow field
and a solenoidal field corresponding to the rotational wake behind the body,
with the flux term describing transfer from the interaction energy between the
two fields and into kinetic energy of the rotational flow. We establish the
validity of the Josephson-Anderson relation for the weak solutions of the Euler
equations obtained in the zero-viscosity limit, with one transfer term due to
inviscid vorticity flux and the other due to a viscous skin-friction anomaly.
Furthermore, we establish weak forms of the local balance equations for both
interaction and rotational energies. We define nonlinear spatial fluxes of
these energies and show that the asymptotic flux of interaction energy to the
wall equals the anomalous skin-friction term in the Josephson-Anderson
relation. However, when the Euler solution satisfies suitably the
no-flow-through condition at the wall, then the anomalous term vanishes. In
this case, we can show also that the asymptotic flux of rotational energy to
the wall must vanish and we obtain in the rotational wake the
Onsager-Duchon-Robert relation between viscous dissipation anomaly and inertial
dissipation due to scale-cascade. In this way we establish a precise connection

dwarfs, we find more compact galaxy sizes and promotion of stellar/neutral gas
disk formation in dSIDM with $(\sigma/m)\leq 1\,{\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ but they
are still consistent with observed galaxy sizes and masses. In addition, as a
result of the steeper central density profiles developed in dSIDM, the sub-kpc
circular velocities of isolated dwarfs in models with $(\sigma/m)\geq 0.1\,{\rm

consistent with the measured stellar velocity dispersions of Local Group dwarfs

Meanwhile, for satellites of the simulated Milky Way-mass hosts, the median
circular velocity profiles are marginally affected by dSIDM physics, but dSIDM
may help address the missing compact dwarf satellites in CDM. The number of
satellites is slightly enhanced in dSIDM, but the differences are small
compared with the large host-to-host variations. In conclusion, the dSIDM
models with constant cross-section $(\sigma/m) \gtrsim 0.1\,{\rm cm^2\,g^{-1}}$

However, models with lower effective cross-sections (at this halo mass/velocity

exercised to the same extent by every scholar. It is unclear whether there are
gender differences in the frequency of self-promotion or the benefit it yields
for individuals. Here, we examine differences in women's and men's scholarly
self-promotion using 23 million Tweet mentions of 2.8 million research papers
published between 2013 and 2018 by 3.5 million authors. Our analysis shows that
women are significantly less likely (27\%) than men to promote their papers,
even after controlling for a number of important factors, including publication
year, journal impact, affiliation rank, author productivity, number of
citations, authorship position, number of coauthors, and research topics. In
addition, women's underrepresentation on Twitter only explains a small portion
of the observed gender difference in self-promotion, as the disparity exists
even among authors active on Twitter. The magnitude of the gender gap is more
strongly associated with papers' journal impact factor than with authors'
affiliation rank, previous productivity, or academic discipline. In particular,
men are 78\% more likely than comparable women scholars to self-promote papers
published in journals with very high impact factor (IF $\geq$ 40), whereas the
difference is only 33\% for papers in low-impact score journals (IF $\leq$ 5).
Furthermore, we find that women face a ``dilemma'' in online science
dissemination -- while they promote their research less often than men on
social media, they risk receiving less of a boost in attention than men if they
do self-promote. Our findings offer the first large-scale evidence for a gender
gap in scholarly self-promotion online and show the circumstances under which
the gap is most substantial, helping inform policy to mitigate discrepancies in
visibility and recognition.

  Neural Networks","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2103.08826",,,,"cs.LG cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art
performance for node classification. However, most existing GNNs would suffer
from the graph imbalance problem. In many real-world scenarios, node classes
are imbalanced, with some majority classes making up most parts of the graph.
The message propagation mechanism in GNNs would further amplify the dominance
of those majority classes, resulting in sub-optimal classification performance.
In this work, we seek to address this problem by generating pseudo instances of
minority classes to balance the training data, extending previous
over-sampling-based techniques. This task is non-trivial, as those techniques
are designed with the assumption that instances are independent. Neglection of
relation information would complicate this oversampling process. Furthermore,
the node classification task typically takes the semi-supervised setting with
only a few labeled nodes, providing insufficient supervision for the generation
of minority instances. Generated new nodes of low quality would harm the
trained classifier. In this work, we address these difficulties by synthesizing
new nodes in a constructed embedding space, which encodes both node attributes
and topology information. Furthermore, an edge generator is trained
simultaneously to model the graph structure and provide relations for new
samples. To further improve the data efficiency, we also explore synthesizing
mixed ``in-between'' nodes to utilize nodes from the majority class in this
over-sampling process. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the
effectiveness of our proposed framework.

clinicians to have a better understanding of disease epidemiology and identify
patients at higher risk of an outcome. Variable selection is often used to
reduce the dimensionality of a prediction model. When conducting variable
selection, it is often beneficial to take selection dependencies into account.
Selection dependencies can help to improve model interpretability, increase the
chance of recovering the true model, and augment the prediction accuracy of the
resulting model. The latent overlapping group lasso can achieve the goal of
incorporating some types of selection dependencies into variable selection by
assigning coefficients to different groups of penalties. However, when the
selection dependencies are complex, there is no roadmap for how to specify the
groups of penalties. Wang et al. (2021) proposed a general framework for
structured variable selection, and provided a condition to verify whether a
penalty grouping respects a set of selection dependencies. Based on this
previous work, we construct roadmaps to derive the grouping specification for
some common selection dependencies and apply them to the problem of
constructing a prediction model for major bleeding among hypertensive patients
recently hospitalized for atrial fibrillation and then prescribed oral
anticoagulants. In the application, we consider a proxy of adherence to
anticoagulant medication and its interaction with dose and oral anticoagulants

agreement with earlier work, we find that after reionization SF proceeds mainly
in halos whose mass exceeds a redshift-dependent ``critical'' mass, Mcrit, set
by the structure of the halos and by the thermal pressure of UV-heated gas.
Mcrit increases from ~10^8 Msun at z~10 to Mcrit ~10^9.7 Msun at z=0, roughly
following the average mass growth of halos in that mass range. This implies
that halos well above or below critical at present have remained so since early
times. Halos of luminous dwarfs today were already above-critical and
star-forming at high redshift, explaining naturally the ubiquitous presence of
ancient stellar populations in dwarfs, regardless of luminosity. The SF history
of systems close to the critical boundary is more complex. SF may cease or
reignite in dwarfs whose host halo falls below or climbs above the critical
boundary, suggesting an attractive explanation for the episodic nature of SF in
some dwarfs. Also, some subcritical halos today may have been above critical in
the past; these systems should at present make up a sizable population of faint
field dwarfs lacking ongoing star formation. Although few such galaxies are
currently known, the discovery of this population would provide strong support
for our results. Our work indicates that, rather than stellar feedback, it is
the ionizing UV background and mass accretion history what regulates SF in the
faintest dwarfs.

received a flurry of scholarly attention from the computer science community in
recent years. In its simplest form, every agent starts with one vote and may
have other votes assigned to them via delegation from other agents. They can
choose to delegate all votes assigned to them to another agent or vote directly
with all votes assigned to them. However, many proposed realizations of liquid
democracy allow for agents to express their delegation/voting preferences in
more complex ways (e.g., a ranked list of potential delegates) and employ a
centralized delegation mechanism to compute the final vote tally. In doing so,
centralized delegation mechanisms can make decisions that affect the outcome of
a vote and where/whether agents are able to delegate their votes. Much of the
analysis thus far has focused on the ability of these mechanisms to make a
correct choice. We extend this analysis by introducing and formalizing other
important properties of a centralized delegation mechanism in liquid democracy
with respect to crucial features such as accountability, transparency,
explainability, fairness, and user agency. In addition, we evaluate existing
methods in terms of these properties, show how some prior work can be augmented
to achieve desirable properties, prove impossibility results for achieving
certain sets of properties simultaneously, and highlight directions for future

component of cellular networks due to their ability of shaping the propagation
environment and thereby improving the coverage. While passive IRS nodes
incorporate a great number of phase-shifting elements and a controller entity,
the phase-shifts are typically determined by the cellular base station (BS) due
to its computational capability. Since the fine granularity control of the
large number of phase-shifters may become prohibitive in practice, it is
important to reduce the control overhead between the BS and the IRS controller.
To this end, in this paper we propose a low-rank approximation of the
near-optimal phase-shifts, which would incur prohibitively high communication
overhead on the BS-IRS controller links. The key idea is to represent the
potentially large IRS phase-shift vector using a low-rank tensor model. This is
achieved by factorizing a tensorized version of the IRS phase-shift vector,
where each component is modeled as the Kronecker product of a predefined number
of factors of smaller sizes, which can be obtained via tensor decomposition
algorithms. We show that the proposed low-rank models drastically reduce the
required feedback requirements associated with the BS-IRS control links. Our
simulation results indicate that the proposed method is especially attractive
in scenarios with a strong line of sight component, in which case nearly the
same spectral efficiency is reached as in the cases with near-optimal
phase-shifts, but with a drastically reduced communication overhead.

These approximations come from using the density of states $N(\epsilon)$ and
the chemical potential $\mu(T)$ either constant or temperature-dependent,
respectively. We use these approximations, a total of three, to calculate the
critical temperature $T_{c}$, the superconductor energy gap $\Delta(T)$, the
chemical potential $\mu(T)$ and the thermodynamic potential $\Omega(T)$ which
are needed to obtain the condensation energy, and compare them with the exact
case, i.e., where no approximations are used. To do this, we use a ternary
Boson-Fermion theory of superconductivity composed of unbound electrons (or
holes) as fermions plus two-electron and two-hole Cooper pairs, both as bosons.
Although all these approximations lead to reasonable values of $T_{c}$ and
$\Delta(T)$, the resulting thermodynamic and chemical potentials are quite
different, so that the condensation energy value could be incorrect. However,
when $N(\epsilon)$ and $\mu(T)$ variables are used, together with a correct
physical interpretation of the condensation energy as the sum of the

methodology to perform Bayesian inference in low-photon imaging problems, with
particular attention to situations involving observation noise processes that
deviate significantly from Gaussian noise, such as binomial, geometric and
low-intensity Poisson noise. These problems are challenging for many reasons.
From an inferential viewpoint, low-photon numbers lead to severe
identifiability issues, poor stability and high uncertainty about the solution.
Moreover, low-photon models often exhibit poor regularity properties that make
efficient Bayesian computation difficult; e.g., hard non-negativity
constraints, non-smooth priors, and log-likelihood terms with exploding
gradients. More precisely, the lack of suitable regularity properties hinders
the use of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo methods based on numerical
approximations of the Langevin stochastic differential equation (SDE), as both
the SDE and its numerical approximations behave poorly. We address this
difficulty by proposing an MCMC methodology based on a reflected and
regularised Langevin SDE, which is shown to be well-posed and exponentially
ergodic under mild and easily verifiable conditions. This then allows us to
derive four reflected proximal Langevin MCMC algorithms to perform Bayesian
computation in low-photon imaging problems. The proposed approach is
demonstrated with a range of experiments related to image deblurring,
denoising, and inpainting under binomial, geometric and Poisson noise.

Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis, is used to measure the

new task, called the closure of $\Pi$ with respect to $M$. The asynchronous
speedup theorem states that if a task $\Pi$ is solvable in $t\geq 1$ rounds in
$M$, then its closure w.r.t. $M$ is solvable in $t-1$ rounds in $M$. We prove
this theorem for iterated models, as long as the model allows solo executions.
We illustrate the power of our asynchronous speedup theorem by providing a new
proof of the wait-free impossibility of consensus using read/write registers,

registers and test\&set objects for $n>2$. The proof is merely by showing that,
in each case, the closure of consensus (w.r.t. the corresponding model) is
consensus itself. Our main application is the study of the power of additional
objects, namely test\&set and binary consensus, for wait-free solving
approximate agreement faster. By analyzing the closure of approximate agreement
w.r.t. each of the two models, we show that while these objects are more
powerful than read/write registers from the computability perspective, they are
not more powerful as far as helping solving approximate agreement faster is

explicitly deal with the data, and developers have to intervene and undergo the
burden of managing the application data, often, via separate cloud services
(e.g., AWS RDS). We overcome this problem of FaaS by borrowing the notion of
object from the object-oriented programming into the serverless systems. We
propose a new paradigm on top of the function abstraction, known as Object as a
Service (OaaS), that offers encapsulation and abstraction benefits. The OaaS
incorporates the application data into the object abstraction and relieves the
developers from dealing with separate cloud services for the data management.
It also unlocks opportunities for built-in optimization features, such as
software reusability, data locality, and caching. Moreover, OaaS enables
dataflow programming such that the developers define a workflow of functions
transparently without getting involved into the synchronization and parallelism
aspects. We implemented a prototype of the OaaS platform that is low-overhead
and scalable. We evaluated it under real-world settings in terms of the
ease-of-use, imposed overhead, and scalability. The results demonstrate that
OaaS streamlines cloud programming and offers scalability with a minor overhead

of climate on society. While high-resolution weather models can forecast many
types of extreme events on synoptic timescales, long-term climatological risk
assessment is an altogether different problem. A once-in-a-century event takes,
on average, 100 years of simulation time to appear just once, far beyond the
typical integration length of a weather forecast model. Therefore, this task is
left to cheaper, but less accurate, low-resolution or statistical models. But
there is untapped potential in weather model output: despite being short in
duration, weather forecast ensembles are produced multiple times a week.
Integrations are launched with independent perturbations, causing them to
spread apart over time and broadly sample phase space. Collectively, these
integrations add up to thousands of years of data. We establish methods to
extract climatological information from these short weather simulations. Using
ensemble hindcasts by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting
(ECMWF) archived in the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) database, we characterize
sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events with multi-centennial return times.
Consistent results are found between alternative methods, including basic
counting strategies and Markov state modeling. By carefully combining
trajectories together, we obtain estimates of SSW frequencies and their
seasonal distributions that are consistent with reanalysis-derived estimates
for moderately rare events, but with much tighter uncertainty bounds, and which
can be extended to events of unprecedented severity that have not yet been
observed historically. These methods hold potential for assessing extreme
events throughout the climate system, beyond this example of stratospheric
extremes.

In model-agnostic explainable recommendation, system designers deploy a
separate explanation model to take as input from the decision model, and
generate explanations to meet the goal of persuasiveness. In this work, we
explore the task of ranking textual rationales (supporting evidences) for
model-agnostic explainable recommendation. Most of existing rationales ranking
algorithms only utilize the rationale IDs and interaction matrices to build
latent factor representations; and the semantic information within the textual
rationales are not learned effectively. We argue that such design is suboptimal
as the important semantic information within the textual rationales may be used
to better profile user preferences and item features. Seeing this gap, we
propose a model named Semantic-Enhanced Bayesian Personalized Explanation
Ranking (SE-BPER) to effectively combine the interaction information and
semantic information. SE-BPER first initializes the latent factor
representations with contextualized embeddings generated by transformer model,
then optimizes them with the interaction data. Extensive experiments show that
such methodology improves the rationales ranking performance while simplifying
the model training process (fewer hyperparameters and faster convergence). We
conclude that the optimal way to combine semantic and interaction information
remains an open question in the task of rationales ranking.

screening policies. Resource availability concerns necessitate the design of
policies which conform to a budget, a problem which can be modelled as a
constrained partially observable Markov decision process (CPOMDP). In this
study, we propose a multi-objective CPOMDP model for breast cancer screening
which allows for supplemental screening methods to accompany mammography. The
model has two objectives: maximize the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and
minimize lifetime breast cancer mortality risk (LBCMR). We identify the Pareto
frontier of optimal solutions for average and high-risk patients at different
budget levels, which can be used by decision-makers to set policies in
practice. We find that the policies obtained by using a weighted objective are
able to generate well-balanced QALYs and LBCMR values. In contrast, the
single-objective models generally sacrifice a substantial amount in terms of
QALYs/LBCMR for a minimal gain in LBCMR/QALYs. Additionally, our results show
that, with the baseline cost values for supplemental screenings as well as the
additional disutility that they incur, they are rarely recommended in CPOMDP
policies, especially in a budget-constrained setting. A sensitivity analysis
reveals the thresholds on cost and disutility values at which supplemental
screenings become advantageous to prescribe.

Furthermore, current approaches process each 3D point individually and ignore

which humans and AI systems learn new visual reasoning tasks. Humans'
remarkable efficiency at learning has been at least partially attributed to
their ability to harness compositionality -- such that they can efficiently
take advantage of previously gained knowledge when learning new tasks. Here, we
introduce a novel visual reasoning benchmark, Compositional Visual Relations

non-verbal reasoning tests and describe a novel method for creating
compositions of abstract rules and associated image datasets at scale. Our

transfer across task rules, as well as the ability to leverage
compositionality. We systematically evaluate modern neural architectures and

its significance for non-Hermitian topological phases, the relevance of the
skin effect to quantum entanglement and critical phenomena has remained
unclear. Here, we find that the skin effect induces a nonequilibrium quantum
phase transition in the entanglement dynamics. We show that the skin effect
gives rise to a macroscopic flow of particles and suppresses the entanglement
propagation and thermalization, leading to the area law of the entanglement
entropy in the nonequilibrium steady state. Moreover, we reveal an entanglement
phase transition induced by the competition between the unitary dynamics and
the skin effect even without disorder or interactions. This entanglement phase
transition accompanies nonequilibrium quantum criticality characterized by a
nonunitary conformal field theory whose effective central charge is extremely
sensitive to the boundary conditions. We also demonstrate that it originates
from an exceptional point of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the concomitant
scale invariance of the skin modes localized according to the power law.
Furthermore, we show that the skin effect leads to the purification and the
reduction of von Neumann entropy even in Markovian open quantum systems

entanglement growth and establishes a fundamental understanding of phase
transitions and critical phenomena in open quantum systems far from thermal

We find that f-mode resonances with azimuthal order $m=2$ or $7 \leq m \leq 19$
fall among the inner rings (6, 5, 4, $\alpha$, and $\beta$) of Uranus, while
f-mode resonances with $2 \leq m \leq 12$ fall in the tenuous $\zeta$ ring

yet-to-be-observed rich dynamics of spectral reorganization have been predicted

propagation invariance in the normal-GVD regime is compatible with
spatio-temporal spectra that are X-shaped, hyperbolic, parabolic, elliptical,

transforming the usage of white dwarfs as cosmochronometers into an accessible
tool. The code estimates the mass and cooling age of the white dwarf, as well
as the mass and main-sequence age of the progenitor star, allowing for a
determination of the total age of the object. We test the reliability of the
method by estimating the parameters of white dwarfs from previous studies, and
find agreement with the literature within measurement errors. By analyzing the
limitation of the code we find a typical uncertainty of 10% on the total age

interface problems in the literature. However, it is challenging to develop
third or higher order accurate methods for problems with curved interfaces and
internal boundaries. In this paper, alternative approaches based on two
different grids are developed for some interface and internal layer problems,
which are different from adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques. For one
dimensional, or two-dimensional problems with straight interfaces or boundary
layers that are parallel to one of the axes, the discussion is relatively easy.
One of challenges is how to construct a fourth order compact finite difference
scheme at boarder grid points that connect two meshes. A two-grid method that
employs a second order discretization near the interface in the fine mesh and a
fourth order discretization away from the interface in the coarse and boarder
grid points is proposed. For two dimensional problems with a curved interface
or an internal layer, a level set representation is utilized for which we can
build a fine mesh within a tube $|\varphi({\bf x}) | \le \delta h$ of the
interface. A new super-third seven-point discretization that can guarantee the
discrete maximum principle has been developed at hanging nodes. The coefficient

which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting. Self-supervised learning
methods can help avoid the requirement of large annotated training datasets,
however, to be useful in real-world applications, they should achieve good
segmentation quality. In this paper, we introduce a Transformer-based method
that uses self-supervision for high-quality fish segmentation. Our proposed
model is trained on videos -- without any annotations -- to perform fish
segmentation in underwater videos taken in situ in the wild. We show that when
trained on a set of underwater videos from one dataset, the proposed model
surpasses previous CNN-based and Transformer-based self-supervised methods and
achieves performance relatively close to supervised methods on two new unseen
underwater video datasets. This demonstrates the great generalisability of our
model and the fact that it does not need a pre-trained model. In addition, we
show that, due to its dense representation learning, our model is
compute-efficient. We provide quantitative and qualitative results that
demonstrate our model's significant capabilities.

energy can move some electrons to above the Fermi Level, providing free charges
to carry the electrical current, even at absolute zero temperature. The Drude
model, Ohm's law, quantum resistance, and the electrical resistivity due to
electron-electron scattering appear naturally as a consequence of the
theoretical description, which is based on the quantization of the angular
momentum and the Fermi-Dirac distribution, considering total energy as
${\epsilon}$ = k$_B$$T$ + ${\Phi}_0$$I$. The electrical and magnetic forces
acting on an electron are related to the ratio between the Fermi velocity and
the speed of light and show that the electron motion is due to helical paths.
Considering the center of mass description for the Bohr atom, it was possible
to show that the magnetic force is related to the electrical force as $F_M$ =
(${\alpha}$/${\pi}$) $F_E$, which demonstrates that the electrons move in
helical paths along the orbit. The helical motion naturally provides for
quantization of the magnetic flux, the spin of the electron, and the first
correction term of the anomalous magnetic moment. Applying the model to
describe the electron-electron scattering allows prediction of the behavior of
the electrical resistivity of many metals at low temperatures, which is in
excellent agreement with empirical observations.

understood. By combining nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and
atomistic Green's function method, we systematically investigate the ITC
spectrum across an ideal interface, i.e., the argon-heavy argon interface. Our
results show that the ITC spectrum increases gradually with temperature as more
phonons and anharmonic scattering channels are activated, e.g., the vibrations
with frequencies larger than 1 THz can contribute 5% (15%) to the total ITC at
2 K (40 K) through anharmonic phonon scatterings channels. We further find that
the ITC spectrum from the left interfacial Hamiltonian is quite different from
that of the right interfacial Hamiltonian, which stems from the asymmetry of
anharmonic phonon scatterings caused by the dissimilar vibrational property of
the two interfacial contacts. While all the phonons are involved in the
anharmonic scatterings for the heavy argon interfacial Hamiltonian, these
phonons involved in the anharmonic phonon scatterings from the argon
interfacial Hamiltonians are mainly these vibrations with frequency smaller
than 1 THz (i.e., the cut-off frequency of heavy argon). Finally, we find the
quantum effect is important for the ITC spectrum at low temperatures, e.g.,
below 30 K in our systems. Our results here systematically investigate the
influence of anharmonicity, non-homogeneity, and quantum effects on the ITC
spectrum, which is critical for designing and optimizing the interfaces with

Existing defenses may be ineffective against highly camouflaged or high
percentages of free riders. To address these challenges, we reconsider the
defense from a novel perspective, i.e., model weight evolving
frequency.Empirically, we gain a novel insight that during the FL's training,
the model weight evolving frequency of free-riders and that of benign clients
are significantly different. Inspired by this insight, we propose a novel
defense method based on the model Weight Evolving Frequency, referred to as
WEF-Defense.Specifically, we first collect the weight evolving frequency
(defined as WEF-Matrix) during local training. For each client, it uploads the
local model's WEF-Matrix to the server together with its model weight for each
iteration. The server then separates free-riders from benign clients based on
the difference in the WEF-Matrix. Finally, the server uses a personalized
approach to provide different global models for corresponding clients.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on five datasets and five models
demonstrate that WEF-Defense achieves better defense effectiveness than the

Na2Co2TeO6 which has been nominated as a Kitaev material. Measurements of
magnetic shift and width of the NMR line as functions of temperature and
magnetic field show that a spin-disordered phase does not appear up to a field
of 9 T. In the antiferromagnetic phase just below the Neel temperature TN, we
find a temperature region extending down to ~TN/2 where the nuclear
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 remains enhanced and is further increased by
a magnetic field. This region crosses over to a low temperature region
characterized by the rapidly decreasing 1/T1 which is less field-sensitive.
These observations suggest incoherent spin excitations with a large spectral
weight at low energies in the intermediate temperature region transforming to
more conventional spin-wave excitations at low temperatures. The drastic change
of the low-energy spin dynamics is likely caused by strong damping of spin
waves activated only in the intermediate temperature region, which may be
realized for triple-q magnetic order possessing partially-disordered moments as
scattering centers of spin waves. In the paramagnetic phase near TN, dramatic
field suppression of 1/T1 is observed. From analysis of the temperature
dependence of 1/T1 based on the renormalized-classical description of a
two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnet, we find the field-dependent spin
stiffness constant that scales with TN as a function of magnetic field. This
implies field suppression of the energy scale characterizing both
two-dimensional spin correlations and three-dimensional long-range order, which
may be associated with an increasing effect of frustration in magnetic fields.

In this paper, we introduce an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided

transmit power of the base station (BS) by classifying users with different
security requirements. Specifically, we divide the users into confidential
subscribers with secure communication requirements and general communication
users with simple communication requirements. During the communication period,
we guarantee the secure rate of the confidential subscribers while ensuring the
service quality of the general communication users, thereby reducing the
transmit power of the BS. To realize such a secure and green information
transmission, the BS implements a beamforming design on the transmitted signal
superimposed with artificial noise (AN) and then broadcasts it to users with
the assistance of the IRS's reflection. We develop an alternating optimization
framework to minimize the BS downlink power with respect to the active
beamformers of the BS, the AN vector at the BS, and the reflection phase shifts
of the IRS. A successive convex approximation (SCA) method is proposed so that
the nonconvex beamforming problems can be converted to tractable convex forms.
The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is convergent
and can reduce the transmit power by 20\% compared to the best benchmark
scheme.

scientific and engineering applications due to its superior heat transfer
capability. An important parameter required in the design of many He II based
cooling systems is the peak heat flux $q^*$, which refers to the threshold heat
flux above which boiling spontaneously occurs in He II. Past experimental and
numerical studies showed that $q^*$ increases when the heating time $t_h$ is
reduced, which leads to an intuitive expectation that very high $q^*$ may be
achievable at sufficiently small $t_h$. Knowledge on how $q^*$ actually behaves
at small $t_h$ is important for applications such as laser ablation in He II.
Here we present a numerical study on the evolution of the thermodynamic state
of the He II in front of a planar heater by solving the He II two-fluid
equations of motion. For an applied heat flux, we determine the heating time
beyond which the He II near the heater transits to the vapor phase. As such, a
curve correlating $q^*$ and $t_h$ can be obtained, which nicely reproduces some
relevant experimental data. Surprisingly, we find that there exists a critical
peak heat flux $q^*_c$, above which boiling occurs nearly instantaneously
regardless of $t_h$. We reveal that the boiling in this regime is essentially
cavitation caused by the combined effects of the first-sound and the
second-sound waves in He II. Based on this physical picture, an analytical
model for $q^*_c$ is developed, which reproduces the simulated $q^*_c$ values
at various He II bath temperatures and hydrostatic head pressures. This work
represents a major progress in our understanding of transient heat transfer in
He II.

unsourced random access (URA) scheme for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless
networks with massive sporadic traffic devices. First of all, this paper
proposes a novel joint active device separation (the message recovery of active
device) and channel estimation architecture for the RIS-aided URA.
Specifically, the RIS passive reflection is optimized before the successful
device separation. Then, by associating the data sequences to multiple rank-one
tensors and exploiting the angular sparsity of the RIS-BS channel, the
detection problem is cast as a high-order coupled tensor decomposition problem
without the need of exploiting pilot sequences. However, the inherent coupling
among multiple sparse device-RIS channels, together with the unknown number of
active devices make the detection problem at hand deviate from the widely-used
coupled tensor decomposition format. To overcome this challenge, this paper
judiciously devises a probabilistic model that captures both the element-wise
sparsity from the angular channel model and the low-rank property due to the
sporadic nature of URA. Then, based on such a probabilistic model, a iterative
detection algorithm is developed under the framework of sparse variational
inference, where each update iteration is obtained in a closed-form and the
number of active devices can be automatically estimated for effectively
avoiding the overfitting of noise. Extensive simulation results confirm the
excellence of the proposed URA algorithm, especially for the case of a large
number of reflecting elements for accommodating a significantly large number of
devices.

  In a model illustrative calculation, we study the fate of a Klein Gordon wave
subjected to the intense radio frequency waves generated in the vicinity of an
active galactic nuclei (AGN). In the framework of the paper we examine a
quantum wave associated with a relativistic particle, and it is shown that the

acceleration of particles to very high energies.

that the resonant energization could catapult particles to extreme energies

not unique and the boundary and therefore the number shows strong variation
with angular resolution and sensitivity. At low angular resolution (large beam
sizes), molecular clouds merge together in PPV space, while low sensitivity
(high cutoffs) misses small faint molecular clouds and takes bright parts of
large molecular clouds as single ones. At high angular resolution and
sensitivity, giant molecular clouds (GMCs) are resolved into individual clouds,
and their diffuse components are also revealed. Consequently, GMCs are more
appropriately interpreted as clusters or aggregates of molecular clouds, i.e.,

This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks
where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the
message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a
neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with
theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It
thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of
oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for

location to the final location for which one cannot deduce whether the system
went through the private location. We also consider the full timed opacity

that these problems are decidable for timed automata (TAs) but become
undecidable when one adds parameters, yielding parametric timed automata

an algorithm for synthesizing PTAs parameter valuations guaranteeing that the
resulting TA is opaque. We finally show that our method can also apply to

steps are taken using significance tests, internal consistency checks using the
Gaia radial velocity measurements (when available), as well as literature
radial velocity and astrometric data, leading to a subset of candidates that

fundamental being that the Islamic economy is characterized by the prohibition
of interest (riba) and speculation (gharar) and the enforcement of
Shariah-compliant profit-loss sharing (mudaraba, murabaha, salam, etc.) and
wealth redistribution (waqf, sadaqah, and zakat). In this study, I apply new
econophysics models of wealth exchange and redistribution to quantitatively
compare these characteristics to those of capitalism and evaluate wealth
distribution and disparity using a simulation. Specifically, regarding
exchange, I propose a loan interest model representing finance capitalism and
riba and a joint venture model representing shareholder capitalism and
mudaraba; regarding redistribution, I create a transfer model representing
inheritance tax and waqf. As exchanges are repeated from an initial uniform
distribution of wealth, wealth distribution approaches a power-law distribution
more quickly for the loan interest than the joint venture model; and the Gini
index, representing disparity, rapidly increases. The joint venture model's
Gini index increases more slowly, but eventually, the wealth distribution in
both models becomes a delta distribution, and the Gini index gradually
approaches 1. Next, when both models are combined with the transfer model to
redistribute wealth in every given period, the loan interest model has a larger
Gini index than the joint venture model, but both converge to a Gini index of
less than 1. These results quantitatively reveal that in the Islamic economy,
disparity is restrained by prohibiting riba and promoting reciprocal exchange
in mudaraba and redistribution through waqf. Comparing Islamic and capitalist
economies provides insights into the benefits of economically embracing the
ethical practice of mutual aid and suggests guidelines for an alternative to
capitalism.

modern HPO algorithms are black-boxes themselves. This makes it difficult to
understand the decision process which leads to the selected configuration,
reduces trust in HPO, and thus hinders its broad adoption. Here, we study the
combination of HPO with interpretable machine learning (IML) methods such as
partial dependence plots. These techniques are more and more used to explain
the marginal effect of hyperparameters on the black-box cost function or to
quantify the importance of hyperparameters. However, if such methods are
naively applied to the experimental data of the HPO process in a post-hoc
manner, the underlying sampling bias of the optimizer can distort
interpretations. We propose a modified HPO method which efficiently balances
the search for the global optimum w.r.t. predictive performance \emph{and} the
reliable estimation of IML explanations of an underlying black-box function by
coupling Bayesian optimization and Bayesian Algorithm Execution. On benchmark
cases of both synthetic objectives and HPO of a neural network, we demonstrate
that our method returns more reliable explanations of the underlying black-box
without a loss of optimization performance.

simulations. However, its original uncorrected formulation overestimates the
forces near the tip of the blades and does not reproduce well forces on
translating wings. The recently proposed vortex-based smearing correction for
the ALM is a correction based on physical and mathematical properties of the
simulation that allows for a more accurate and general ALM. So far, to correct
the forces on the blades, the smearing correction depended on an iterative
process at every time step, which is usually slower, less stable and less
deterministic than direct methods. In this work, a non-iterative process is
proposed and validated. First, we propose a formulation of the non-linear
lifting line that is equivalent to the ALM with smearing correction, showing
that their results are practically identical for a translating wing. Then, by
linearizing the lifting line method, the iterative process of the correction is
substituted by the direct solution of a small linear system. No significant
difference is observed in the results of the iterative and non-iterative
corrections, both in wing and rotor simulations. Additional contributions of
the present work include the use of a more accurate approximation for the
velocity induced by a smeared vortex segment and the implementation of a
free-vortex wake model to define the vortex sheet, that contribute to the
accuracy and generality of the method. The results present here may motivate
the adoption of the ALM by other communities, for example, in fixed-wing
applications.

as well as integrating into Earth system models for weather forecasts and
climate projections. Regardless of their significance, guaranteeing the
trustworthiness of ocean software and modelling systems is a long-standing
challenge. The testing of ocean software suffers a lot from the so-called
oracle problem, which refers to the absence of test oracles mainly due to the
nonlinear interactions of multiple physical variables and the high complexity
in computation. In the ocean, observed tidal signals are distorted by
non-deterministic physical variables, hindering us from knowing the ""true""
astronomical tidal constituents existing in the timeseries. In this paper, we
present how to test tidal analysis and prediction (TAP) software based on
metamorphic testing (MT), a simple yet effective testing approach to the oracle

property of astronomical tide, and then use them to successfully detect a
real-life defect in an open-source TAP software. We also conduct a series of
experiments to further demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of MT in
the testing of TAP software. Our study not only justifies the potential of MT

resource management techniques for power or temperature minimization either
rely on measurements that are often not available (such as power) or fail to

the matrix Lie algebra basis through a sequence of tridiagonal eigenvalue
problems, efficiently solved by well-established linear algebra libraries. The
same tridiagonal splitting allows for computation of the stream matrix,
involving the inverse Laplacian, for which we design an efficient parallel
implementation on distributed memory systems. The resulting overall
computational complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ per time-step for $N^2$ spatial
degrees of freedom. The dominating computational cost is matrix-matrix
multiplication, carried out via the parallel library ScaLAPACK. Scaling tests
show approximately linear scaling up to around $2500$ cores for the matrix size
$N=4096$ with a computational time per time-step of about $0.55$ seconds. These
results allow for long-time simulations and the gathering of statistical
quantities while simultaneously conserving the Casimir functions. We illustrate
the developed algorithm for Euler's equations at the resolution $N=2048$.

if and only if the space of all minimal prime ideals of $A_c(X)$ is compact.
Moreover, $\Gamma(C_c(X))$ is complemented when and only when its subgraph

$C_c(X)$ is complemented if and only if the comaximal graph of its over-ring

  for Crowd Counting",,,,,"cs.LG cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The lightweight crowd counting models, in particular knowledge distillation
(KD) based models, have attracted rising attention in recent years due to their
superiority on computational efficiency and hardware requirement. However,
existing KD based models usually suffer from the capacity gap issue, resulting
in the performance of the student network being limited by the teacher network.
In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a novel review mechanism
following KD models, motivated by the review mechanism of human-beings during
the study. Thus, the proposed model is dubbed ReviewKD. The proposed model
consists of an instruction phase and a review phase, where we firstly exploit a
well-trained heavy teacher network to transfer its latent feature to a
lightweight student network in the instruction phase, then in the review phase
yield a refined estimate of the density map based on the learned feature
through a review mechanism. The effectiveness of ReviewKD is demonstrated by a
set of experiments over six benchmark datasets via comparing to the
state-of-the-art models. Numerical results show that ReviewKD outperforms
existing lightweight models for crowd counting, and can effectively alleviate
the capacity gap issue, and particularly has the performance beyond the teacher
network. Besides the lightweight models, we also show that the suggested review
mechanism can be used as a plug-and-play module to further boost the
performance of a kind of heavy crowd counting models without modifying the
neural network architecture and introducing any additional model parameter.

fundamental problem with various applications. Existing methods for estimating
NDV can be broadly classified into two categories: i) scanning-based methods,
which scan the entire data and maintain a sketch to approximate NDV; and ii)
sampling-based methods, which estimate NDV using sampling data rather than
accessing the entire data warehouse. Scanning-based methods achieve a lower
approximation error at the cost of higher I/O and more time. Sampling-based
estimation is preferable in applications with a large data volume and a
permissible error restriction due to its higher scalability. However, while the
sampling-based method is more effective on a single machine, it is less
practical in a distributed environment with massive data volumes. For obtaining
the final NDV estimators, the entire sample must be transferred throughout the
distributed system, incurring a prohibitive communication cost when the sample
rate is significant. This paper proposes a novel sketch-based distributed
method that achieves sub-linear communication costs for distributed
sampling-based NDV estimation under mild assumptions. Our method leverages a
sketch-based algorithm to estimate the sample's {\em frequency of frequency} in
the {\em distributed streaming model}, which is compatible with most classical
sampling-based NDV estimators. Additionally, we provide theoretical evidence
for our method's ability to minimize communication costs in the worst-case
scenario. Extensive experiments show that our method saves orders of magnitude
in communication costs compared to existing sampling- and sketch-based methods.

fields of the coronal holes. As a comparison, we also use a thermodynamic
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to synthesize coronal images, and identify CHs
from the synthetic images. The results from both the potential-field CHs and
synthetic MHD CHs reveal that there is a significant percentage of closed field
lines extending beyond the CH boundaries and more than 50% (17%) of PF (MHD)
CHs do not contain OMF lines. The boundary-crossing field lines are more likely
to be found in the lower latitudes during active times. While they tend to be
located slightly closer than the non-boundary-crossing ones to the CH
boundaries, nearly 40% (20%) of them in PF (MHD) CHs are not located in the
boundary regions. The CHs without open field lines are often smaller and less
unipolar than those with open field lines. The MHD model indicates higher
temperature variations along the boundary-crossing field lines than the
non-boundary crossing ones. The main difference between the results of the two
models is that the dominant field lines in the PF and MHD CHs are closed and

utilizes a unilateral dependency optimization strategy, i.e., minimizing the
dependency between inputs (i.e., features) and outputs (i.e., labels) during
training the classifier. However, such a minimization process conflicts with
minimizing the supervised loss that aims to maximize the dependency between
inputs and outputs, causing an explicit trade-off between model robustness
against MI attacks and model utility on classification tasks. In this paper, we
aim to minimize the dependency between the latent representations and the
inputs while maximizing the dependency between latent representations and the
outputs, named a bilateral dependency optimization (BiDO) strategy. In
particular, we use the dependency constraints as a universally applicable
regularizer in addition to commonly used losses for deep neural networks (e.g.,
cross-entropy), which can be instantiated with appropriate dependency criteria
according to different tasks. To verify the efficacy of our strategy, we
propose two implementations of BiDO, by using two different dependency
measures: BiDO with constrained covariance (BiDO-COCO) and BiDO with
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (BiDO-HSIC). Experiments show that BiDO
achieves the state-of-the-art defense performance for a variety of datasets,

drop compared to the well-trained classifier with no defense, which lights up a
novel road to defend against MI attacks.

effective temperatures up to Teff = 6900 K. The third data release, Gaia DR3,
extends this up to Teff = 14,500 K. We derive the radial velocities for hot
stars (i.e. in the Teff = 6900 - 14,500 K range) from data obtained with the
Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) on board Gaia. The radial velocities were
determined by the standard technique of measuring the Doppler shift of a
template spectrum that was compared to the observed spectrum. The RVS
wavelength range is very limited. The proximity to and systematic blueward
offset of the calcium infrared triplet to the hydrogen Paschen lines in hot
stars can result in a systematic offset in radial velocity. For the hot stars,
we developed a specific code to improve the selection of the template spectrum,
thereby avoiding this systematic offset. With the improved code, and with the
correction we propose to the DR3 archive radial velocities, we obtain values
that agree with reference values to within 3 km/s (in median). Because of the
required S/N for applying the improved code, the hot star radial velocities in
DR3 are mostly limited to stars with a magnitude in the RVS wavelength band <=
12 mag.

  Models to Learn About Real-World Phenomena",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Interpretable machine learning (IML) is concerned with the behavior and the
properties of machine learning models. Scientists, however, are only interested
in models as a gateway to understanding phenomena. Our work aligns these two
perspectives and shows how to design IML property descriptors. These
descriptors are IML methods that provide insight not just into the model, but
also into the properties of the phenomenon the model is designed to represent.
We argue that IML is necessary for scientific inference with ML models because
their elements do not individually represent phenomenon properties; instead,
the model in its entirety does. However, current IML research often conflates
two goals of model analysis -- model audit and scientific inference -- making
it unclear which model interpretations can be used to learn about phenomena.
Building on statistical decision theory, we show that IML property descriptors
applied on a model provide access to relevant aspects of the joint probability
distribution of the data. We identify what questions such descriptors can
address, provide a guide to building appropriate descriptors and quantify their
epistemic uncertainty.

conditions in galaxies, they provide the key information for recovering the
assembly history of galaxies. In this work, we explore the
chemo-chrono-kinematics of accreted and in-situ stars, by analyzing six M31/MW
analogues from the HESTIA suite of cosmological hydrodynamics zoom-in
simulations of the Local Group. We found that the merger debris are chemically
distinct from the survived dwarf galaxies. The mergers debris have abundances
expected for stars originating from dwarfs that had their star formation
activity quenched at early times. Accreted stellar haloes, including individual
debris, reveal abundance gradients in the ELz, where the most metal-rich stars
have formed in the inner parts of the disrupted systems before the merger and
mainly contribute to the central regions of the hosts. Therefore, we suggest
that abundance measurements in the inner MW will allow constraining better the
parameters of building blocks of the MW stellar halo. The MDFs of the
individual debris show several peaks and the majority of debris have lower
metallicity than the in-situ stars for Lz>0, while non-rotating and retrograde
accreted stars are similar to the in-situ. Prograde accreted stars show a
prominent knee in the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane while the retrograde stars typically
deposit to a high-[Mg/Fe] sequence. We found that the metal-poor stars
([Fe/H]<-1) of the HESTIA galaxies exhibit between zero to 80 km/s net rotation
which is consistent with the Aurora population. At higher metallicities, we
detect a sharp transition (spin-up) from the turbulent phase to a disk-like
rotation. Mergers debris are similar in the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] plane. However,
combining a set of abundances allows to capture chemical patterns corresponding
to different debris, which are the most prominent as a function of stellar age.

such as equipment life cycle forecasting, weather forecasting, and traffic flow
forecasting. It can be observed from recent research that a variety of
transformer-based models have shown remarkable results in time-series
forecasting. However, there are still some issues that limit the ability of
transformer-based models on time-series forecasting tasks: (i) learning
directly on raw data is susceptible to noise due to its complex and unstable
feature representation; (ii) the self-attention mechanisms pay insufficient
attention to changing features and temporal dependencies. In order to solve
these two problems, we propose a transformer-based differentially reconstructed
attention model DRAformer. Specifically, DRAformer has the following
innovations: (i) learning against differenced sequences, which preserves clear
and stable sequence features by differencing and highlights the changing
properties of sequences; (ii) the reconstructed attention: integrated distance
attention exhibits sequential distance through a learnable Gaussian kernel,
distributed difference attention calculates distribution difference by mapping
the difference sequence to the adaptive feature space, and the combination of
the two effectively focuses on the sequences with prominent associations; (iii)
the reconstructed decoder input, which extracts sequence features by
integrating variation information and temporal correlations, thereby obtaining
a more comprehensive sequence representation. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale datasets demonstrate that DRAformer outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

This trained model is able to modify noisy levels sequentially to create better

we design soft-mask GNN layer to extract desired subgraphs through the mask
mechanism. The soft-mask is defined in a continuous space to maintain the
differentiability and characterize the weights of different parts. Compared
with existing subgraph or hierarchical representation learning methods and
graph pooling operations, the soft-mask GNN layer is not limited by the fixed

metal-insulator-metal structures that can store information in their resistance
states, namely the high resistance (HRS) and low resistance (LRS) states. They
are a potential candidate for a universal memory as these non-volatile memory
elements can offer fast-switching, long retention and switching cycles, and
additionally, are also suitable for direct applications in neuromorphic
computing. In this study, we first present a model to analyze different
resistance states of RRAM devices or so-called ""atomristors"" that utilize novel
2D materials as the switching materials instead of insulators. The developed
model is then used to study the electrical characteristics of a single defect
monolayer MoS$_{2}$ memristor. The change in the device resistance between the
HRS and LRS is associated to the change in the tunneling probability when the
vacancy defects in the 2D material are substituted by the metal atoms from the
electrodes. The distortion due to defects and substituted metal atom is
captured in the 1D potential energy profile by averaging the effect along the
transverse direction. This simplification enables us to model single defect
memristors with a less extensive quantum transport model while taking into
account the presence of defects.

the stellar disc through rotation and which produce gradual modulations in
their light curves (LCs). Our main objective is to characterise the properties
of BY Dra variables over a wide range of stellar masses, temperatures and
rotation periods. A recent study categorised 84,697 BY Dra variables from Data
Release 2 of the Zwicky Transient Facility based on their LCs. We have
collected additional photometric data from multiple surveys and performed
broad-band spectral energy distribution fits to estimate stellar parameters. We
found that more than half of our sample objects are of K spectral type,
covering an extensive range of stellar parameters in the low-mass regime
(0.1-1.3 M$_{\odot}$ ). Compared with previous studies, most of the sources in
our catalogue are rapid rotators, and so most of them must be young stars for
which a spin-down has not yet occurred. We subdivided our catalogue based on
convection zone depth and found that the photospheric activity index, $S_{\rm
ph}$, is lower for higher effective temperatures, i.e., for thinner convective
envelopes. We observe a broad range of photospheric magnetic activity for
different spectral classes owing to the presence of stellar populations of
different ages. We found a higher magnetically active fraction for K- than
M-type stars.

Specifically, each client pretrains a local generative adversarial network

the parameter server (PS) to construct a global shared synthetic dataset. To
generate confident pseudo labels for the synthetic dataset, we also propose an
iterative pseudo labeling mechanism performed by the PS. A combination of the
local private dataset and synthetic dataset with confident pseudo labels leads
to nearly identical data distributions among clients, which improves the
consistency among local models and benefits the global aggregation. Extensive

homogeneous rain streaks, limited background variation, and even misalignment
of image pairs, resulting in incomprehensive evaluation of SID methods. To
address these issues, we establish a new high-quality dataset named
RealRain-1k, consisting of $1,120$ high-resolution paired clean and rainy
images with low- and high-density rain streaks, respectively. Images in
RealRain-1k are automatically generated from a large number of real-world rainy
video clips through a simple yet effective rain density-controllable filtering
method, and have good properties of high image resolution, background
diversity, rain streaks variety, and strict spatial alignment. RealRain-1k also
provides abundant rain streak layers as a byproduct, enabling us to build a
large-scale synthetic dataset named SynRain-13k by pasting the rain streak
layers on abundant natural images. Based on them and existing datasets, we
benchmark more than 10 representative SID methods on three tracks: (1) fully
supervised learning on RealRain-1k, (2) domain generalization to real datasets,
and (3) syn-to-real transfer learning. The experimental results (1) show the
difference of representative methods in image restoration performance and model
complexity, (2) validate the significance of the proposed datasets for model
generalization, and (3) provide useful insights on the superiority of learning
from diverse domains and shed lights on the future research on real-world SID.

feature extraction technique for two sets of multivariate data, which has wide
applications in pattern recognition. DCCA consists of two parts: (i)
mean-centering that subtracts the sample mean from the sample; (ii) solving the
generalized eigenvalue problem. The cost of DCCA is expensive when dealing with
a large number of high-dimensional samples. To solve this problem, here we
propose a quantum DCCA algorithm. Specifically, we devise an efficient method
to compute the mean of all samples, then use block-Hamiltonian simulation and
quantum phase estimation to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem. Our
algorithm achieves a polynomial speedup in the dimension of samples under
certain conditions over its classical counterpart.

been empirically observed across various canonical classification problems.
During the terminal phase of training a deep neural network, the feature
embedding of all examples of the same class tend to collapse to a single
representation, and the features of different classes tend to separate as much
as possible. Neural collapse is often studied through a simplified model,
called the unconstrained feature representation, in which the model is assumed
to have ""infinite expressivity"" and can map each data point to any arbitrary
representation. In this work, we propose a more realistic variant of the
unconstrained feature representation that takes the limited expressivity of the
network into account. Empirical evidence suggests that the memorization of
noisy data points leads to a degradation (dilation) of the neural collapse.
Using a model of the memorization-dilation (M-D) phenomenon, we show one
mechanism by which different losses lead to different performances of the
trained network on noisy data. Our proofs reveal why label smoothing, a
modification of cross-entropy empirically observed to produce a regularization
effect, leads to improved generalization in classification tasks.

with singular source terms is developed by virtually constructing the node
control domains. By defining the connectable node cloud, this novel meshless
method uses the integral of the diffusion term and generalized difference
operators to derive overdetermined equations of the node control volumes. An
empirical method of calculating reliable node control volumes and a
triangulation-based method to determine the connectable point cloud are
developed. NCDMM only focuses on the volume of the node control domain rather
than the specific shape, so the construction of node control domains is called
virtual, which will not increase the computational cost. To our knowledge, this
is the first time to construct node control volumes in the meshless framework,
so this novel method is named a node control domains-based meshless method,
abbreviated as NCDMM, which can also be regarded as an extended finite volume
method (EFVM). Taking two-phase porous flow problems as an example, the NCDMM
discrete schemes meeting local mass conservation are derived by integrating the
generalized finite difference schemes of governing equations on each node
control domain. Finally, existing commonly used low-order finite volume method
(FVM) based nonlinear solvers for various porous flow models can be directly
employed in the proposed NCDMM, significantly facilitating the general-purpose
applications of the NCDMM. Four numerical cases are implemented to test the
computational accuracy, efficiency, convergence, and good adaptability to the
calculation domain with complex geometry and various boundary conditions.

rare. Consequently, searching these rare scenarios by evaluating each sample in
input search space or randomized search would be costly and sometimes
intractable due to large search space, limited computational resources, and

these failure scenarios faster than traditional randomized search. The central
idea of our approach is to separate the input data space in region of high
failure probability and region of low/minimal failure probability based on the
observation made by training data, data drawn from real-world statistics, and
knowledge from a domain expert. Using these information, we can design a

thanks to the nearly 5.6 million stars observed by the RVS and parametrised by
the GSP-spec module. The all-sky Gaia chemical cartography allows a powerful
and precise chemo-dynamical view of the Milky Way with unprecedented spatial
coverage and statistical robustness. First, it reveals the strong vertical
symmetry of the Galaxy and the flared structure of the disc. Second, the
observed kinematic disturbances of the disc -- seen as phase space correlations
-- and kinematic or orbital substructures are associated with chemical patterns
that favour stars with enhanced metallicities and lower [alpha/Fe] abundance
ratios compared to the median values in the radial distributions. This is
detected both for young objects that trace the spiral arms and older
populations. Several alpha, iron-peak elements and at least one heavy element
trace the thin and thick disc properties in the solar cylinder. Third, young
disc stars show a recent chemical impoverishment in several elements. Fourth,
the largest chemo-dynamical sample of open clusters analysed so far shows a
steepening of the radial metallicity gradient with age, which is also observed
in the young field population. Finally, the Gaia chemical data have the
required coverage and precision to unveil galaxy accretion debris and heated
disc stars on halo orbits through their [alpha/Fe] ratio, and to allow the
study of the chemo-dynamical properties of globular clusters. Gaia DR3
chemo-dynamical diagnostics open new horizons before the era of ground-based
wide-field spectroscopic surveys. They unveil a complex Milky Way that is the
outcome of an eventful evolution, shaping it to the present day (abridged).

magnetic order, dielectrics, and conductors that hold transverse spins when
they are evanescent. Even without any relativistic effect, the transverse spin
of the evanescent waves are locked to the momentum and the surface normal of
their propagation plane. This chirality thereby acts as a generalized
spin-orbit interaction, which leads to the discovery of various chiral
interactions between magnetic, phononic, electronic, photonic, and plasmonic
excitations in spintronics that mediate the excitation of quasiparticles into a
single direction, leading to phenomena such as chiral spin and phonon pumping,
chiral spin Seebeck, spin skin, magnonic trap, magnon Doppler, and spin diode
effects. Intriguing analogies with electric counterparts in the nano-optics and
plasmonics exist. After a brief review of the concepts of chirality that
characterize the ground state chiral magnetic textures and chirally coupled
magnets in spintronics, we turn to the chiral phenomena of excited states. We
present a unified electrodynamic picture for dynamical chirality in spintronics
in terms of generalized spin-orbit interaction and compare it with that in
nano-optics and plasmonics. Based on the general theory, we subsequently review
the theoretical progress and experimental evidence of chiral interaction, as
well as the near-field transfer of the transverse spins, between various
excitations in magnetic, photonic, electronic and phononic nanostructures at
GHz time scales. We provide a perspective for future research before concluding
this article.

in spectroscopic observations but their origins remain unclear. DIBs play an
important role in the life cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM) and can also
be used to trace Galactic structure. Here, we demonstrate the capacity of the
Gaia-Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) in Gaia DR3 to reveal the spatial
distribution of the unknown molecular species responsible for the most
prominent DIB at 862 nm in the RVS passband, exploring the Galactic ISM within
a few kiloparsecs from the Sun. The DIBs are measured within the GSP-Spec
module using a Gaussian profile fit for cool stars and a Gaussian process for
hot stars. In addition to the equivalent widths and their uncertainties, Gaia
DR3 provides their characteristic central wavelength, width, and quality flags.
We present an extensive sample of 476.117 individual DIB measurements obtained
in a homogeneous way covering the entire sky. We compare spatial distributions
of the DIB carrier with interstellar reddening and find evidence that DIB
carriers are present in a local bubble around the Sun which contains nearly no
dust. We characterised the DIB equivalent width with a local density of $0.19
\pm 0.04$ Angstr\""om/kpc and a scale height of $\rm 98.60_{-8.46}^{+11.10}$ pc.
The latter is smaller than the dust scale height, indicating that DIBs are more
concentrated towards the Galactic plane. We determine the rest-frame wavelength
with unprecedented precision ($\rm \lambda_{0} = 8620.86\, \pm 0.019$
Angstr\""om in air) and reveal a remarkable correspondence between the DIB

the chemo-physical parameters from combined RVS spectra of single stars. The

individual chemical abundances of N, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, FeI, FeII, Ni, Zr,
Ce and Nd; the differential equivalent width of a cyanogen line; and the
parameters of a DIB feature. Another workflow, based on an artificial neural
network, provides a second set of atmospheric parameters that are useful for
classification control. We implement a detailed quality flag chain considering
different error sources. With about 5.6 million stars, the Gaia DR3 GSP-spec
all-sky catalogue is the largest compilation of stellar chemo-physical
parameters ever published and the first one from space data. Internal and
external biases have been studied taking into account the implemented flags. In
some cases, simple calibrations with low degree polynomials are suggested. The
homogeneity and quality of the estimated parameters enables chemo-dynamical
studies of Galactic stellar populations, interstellar extinction studies from
individual spectra, and clear constraints on stellar evolution models. We
highly recommend that users adopt the provided quality flags for scientific
exploitation . The Gaia DR3 GSP-spec catalogue is a major step in the
scientific exploration of Milky Way stellar populations, confirming the Gaia

from a primitive organism waiting for the food to come into contact for eating

sophisticated developments of evolution, but it still has defects. Humans have
evolved a biological perception algorithm capable of driving cars, operating
machinery, piloting aircraft, and navigating ships over millions of years.
Automating these capabilities for computers is critical for various
applications, including self-driving cars, augmented reality, and architectural
surveying. Near-field visual perception in the context of self-driving cars can
perceive the environment in a range of $0-10$ meters and 360{\deg} coverage
around the vehicle. It is a critical decision-making component in the
development of safer automated driving. Recent advances in computer vision and
deep learning, in conjunction with high-quality sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs, have fueled mature visual perception solutions. Until now, far-field
perception has been the primary focus. Another significant issue is the limited
processing power available for developing real-time applications. Because of
this bottleneck, there is frequently a trade-off between performance and
run-time efficiency. We concentrate on the following issues in order to address
them: 1) Developing near-field perception algorithms with high performance and
low computational complexity for various visual perception tasks such as
geometric and semantic tasks using convolutional neural networks. 2) Using
Multi-Task Learning to overcome computational bottlenecks by sharing initial
convolutional layers between tasks and developing optimization strategies that

position with respect to the wavenumber axis and the imaginary component of the
oscillatory frequency largely depend on the modulation type and gap order.
Finally, we demonstrate the coalescence of multiple Bloch-wave modes at the
emergent exceptional points where significant direction-dependent amplification
can be realized by triggering specific harmonics through a process which is
detailed herein.

much attention. Adversarial examples refer to the examples which are capable to
induce the DNNs return completely predictions by introducing carefully designed
perturbations. Obviously, adversarial examples bring great security risks to
the development of deep learning. Recently, Some defense approaches against
adversarial examples have been proposed, however, in our opinion, the
performance of these approaches are still limited. In this paper, we propose a
new ensemble defense approach named the Negative Correlation Ensemble (NCEn),
which achieves compelling results by introducing gradient directions and
gradient magnitudes of each member in the ensemble negatively correlated and at
the same time, reducing the transferability of adversarial examples among them.
Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results demonstrate that
NCEn can improve the adversarial robustness of ensembles effectively.

peridynamic operators is provided. The analysis is presented for state-based
peridynamic operators for isotropic homogeneous media in any spatial dimension.
We provide explicit formulas for the eigenvalues in terms of the space
dimension, the nonlocal parameters, and the material properties.
  The approach we follow is based on the Fourier multiplier analysis developed
for the nonlocal Laplacian. The Fourier multipliers of linear peridynamic
operators are second-order tensor fields, which are given through integral
representations. It is shown that the eigenvalues of the peridynamic operators
can be derived directly from the eigenvalues of the Fourier multiplier tensors.
  We reveal a simple structure for the Fourier multipliers in terms of
hypergeometric functions, which allows for providing integral representations
as well as hypergeometric representations of the eigenvalues. These
representations are utilized to show the convergence of the eigenvalues of
linear peridynamics to the eigenvalues of the Navier operator of linear
elasticity in the limit of vanishing nonlocality. Moreover, the hypergeometric
representation of the eigenvalues is utilized to compute the spectrum of linear
peridynamic operators.

development of cloud-based service-oriented architectures and the recent
availability of low-cost underwater acoustic modems and long-range above water

and port activities. Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) can, for instance, be used
to perform bathymetry and environmental data collection tasks to ensure
under-keel clearance and to monitor the quality of the water. Similarly,
Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) can be deployed to inspect ship hulls and
typical port infrastructure elements, such as quay and sheet pilling walls. In
this paper we present the complete system deployed for the small-scale
demonstrations of the Robotic Vessels as-a-Service (RoboVaaS) project, which
introduces an on-demand service-based cloud system that dispatches Unmanned
Vehicles (UVs) capable of performing the required service either autonomously
or piloted. These vessels are able to interact with sensors deployed in the
port and with the shore station through an integrated underwater and above
water network. The developed system has been validated through sea trials and
showcased through an underwater sensor data collection service. The results of
the test presented in this paper provide a proof-of-concept of the system
design and indicate its technical feasibility. It also shows the need for
further developments for a mature technology allowing on-demand robotic
maritime assistance services in real operational scenarios.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Fake news spreads at an unprecedented speed, reaches global audiences and
poses huge risks to users and communities. Most existing fake news detection
algorithms focus on building supervised training models on a large amount of
manually labeled data, which is expensive to acquire or often unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel label noise-resistant mean teaching approach
(LNMT) for weakly supervised fake news detection. LNMT leverages unlabeled news
and feedback comments of users to enlarge the amount of training data and
facilitates model training by generating refined labels as weak supervision.
Specifically, LNMT automatically assigns initial weak labels to unlabeled
samples based on semantic correlation and emotional association between news
content and the comments. Moreover, in order to suppress the noises in weak
labels, LNMT establishes a mean teacher framework equipped with label
propagation and label reliability estimation. The framework measures a weak
label similarity matrix between the teacher and student networks, and
propagates different valuable weak label information to refine the weak labels.
Meanwhile, it exploits the consistency between the output class likelihood
vectors of the two networks to evaluate the reliability of the weak labels and
incorporates the reliability into model optimization to alleviate the negative
effect of noisy weak labels. Extensive experiments show the superior
performance of LNMT.

  Antibody-Virus Interactions Across Studies",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG q-bio.BM q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A central challenge in every field of biology is to use existing measurements
to predict the outcomes of future experiments. In this work, we consider the
wealth of antibody inhibition data against variants of the influenza virus. Due
to this viru's genetic diversity and evolvability, the variants examined in one
study will often have little-to-no overlap with other studies, making it
difficult to discern common patterns or unify datasets for further analysis. To
that end, we develop a computational framework that predicts how an antibody or
serum would inhibit any variant from any other study. We use this framework to
greatly expand seven influenza datasets utilizing hemagglutination inhibition,
validating our method upon 200,000 existing measurements and predicting
2,000,000 new values along with their uncertainties. With these new values, we
quantify the transferability between seven vaccination and infection studies in
humans and ferrets, show that the serum potency is negatively correlated with
breadth, and present a tool for pandemic preparedness. This data-driven
approach does not require any information beyond each virus's name and
measurements, and even datasets with as few as 5 viruses can be expanded,
making this approach widely applicable. Future influenza studies using
hemagglutination inhibition can directly utilize our curated datasets to
predict newly measured antibody responses against ~80 H3N2 influenza viruses
from 1968-2011, whereas immunological studies utilizing other viruses or a
different assay only need a single partially-overlapping dataset to extend
their work. In essence, this approach enables a shift in perspective when
analyzing data from ""what you see is what you get"" into ""what anyone sees is
what everyone gets.""
