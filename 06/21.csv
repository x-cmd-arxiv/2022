as a strong tool for the worst-case performance analysis of first order
methods. In this paper, we derive new non-ergodic convergence rates for the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) by using performance
estimation. We give some examples which show the exactness of the given bounds.
We also study the linear and R-linear convergence of ADMM. We establish that
ADMM enjoys a global linear convergence rate if and only if the dual objective
satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL)inequality in the presence of strong
convexity. In addition, we give an explicit formula for the linear convergence
rate factor. Moreover, we study the R-linear convergence of ADMM under two new

graphs and study the exact large deviations of a local dynamical observable. We
prove, in the thermodynamic limit, that this observable undergoes a first-order
dynamical phase transition (DPT). This is interpreted as a `co-existence' of
paths in the fluctuations that visit the highly connected bulk of the graph
(delocalization) and paths that visit the boundary (localization). The methods
we used also allow us to characterize analytically the scaling function that
describes the finite size crossover between the localized and delocalized
regimes. Remarkably, we also show that the DPT is robust with respect to a
change in the graph topology, which only plays a role in the crossover regime.
All results support the view that a first-order DPT may also appear in random
walks on infinite-size random graphs.

development of robust training methods that account for adversarial examples.
In this paper, we aim to understand how the properties of representations

networks, such as, degradation of performance on benign inputs, poor
generalization of robustness, and increase in over-fitting. We utilize a
powerful set of tools known as representation similarity metrics, across three

DNNs with different training procedures, architectural parameters and
adversarial constraints. Our experiments highlight hitherto unseen properties
of robust representations that we posit underlie the behavioral differences of
robust networks. We discover a lack of specialization in robust networks'
representations along with a disappearance of `block structure'. We also find
overfitting during robust training largely impacts deeper layers. These, along
with other findings, suggest ways forward for the design and training of better

addressed. For example, the inclusion of small cell networks (SCN) into 5G
brings the network closer to the connected users, providing a better quality of
services (QoS), resulting in a significant increase in the number of Handover
procedures (HO), which will affect the security, latency and efficiency of the

issue, this article proposes a secure region-based handover scheme with user
anonymity and an efficient revocation mechanism that supports seamless

privacy-preserving authentication protocols, i.e., initial authentication
protocol, intra-region handover protocol and inter-region handover protocol,
for dealing with three communication scenarios. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first paper to consider the privacy and security in both the
intra-region and inter-region handover scenarios in 5G communication. Detailed
security and performance analysis of our proposed scheme is presented to show
that it is resilient against many security threats, is cost-effective in

  Audit Models",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This study examines issues of algorithmic fairness in the context of systems
that inform tax audit selection by the United States Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). While the field of algorithmic fairness has developed primarily around
notions of treating like individuals alike, we instead explore the concept of
vertical equity -- appropriately accounting for relevant differences across
individuals -- which is a central component of fairness in many public policy
settings. Applied to the design of the U.S. individual income tax system,
vertical equity relates to the fair allocation of tax and enforcement burdens
across taxpayers of different income levels. Through a unique collaboration
with the Treasury Department and IRS, we use access to anonymized individual
taxpayer microdata, risk-selected audits, and random audits from 2010-14 to
study vertical equity in tax administration. In particular, we assess how the
use of modern machine learning methods for selecting audits may affect vertical
equity. First, we show how the use of more flexible machine learning
(classification) methods -- as opposed to simpler models -- shifts audit
burdens from high to middle-income taxpayers. Second, we show that while
existing algorithmic fairness techniques can mitigate some disparities across
income, they can incur a steep cost to performance. Third, we show that the
choice of whether to treat risk of underreporting as a classification or
regression problem is highly consequential. Moving from classification to
regression models to predict underreporting shifts audit burden substantially
toward high income individuals, while increasing revenue. Last, we explore the
role of differential audit cost in shaping the audit distribution. We show that
a narrow focus on return-on-investment can undermine vertical equity. Our
results have implications for the design of algorithmic tools across the public
sector.

them. Specifically, we show how to resolve a well-known problem that when
individual constituent distributions of an equity index are inferred from the
single-stock option markets and combined in a multi-dimensional
local/stochastic volatility model, the resulting basket option prices will not
generate a skew matching that of the options on the equity index corresponding

steps. First, we propose an ``effective'' local volatility model by mapping the
general multi-dimensional basket onto a collection of marginal distributions.
Second, we build a multivariate dependence structure between all the marginal
distributions assuming a jump-diffusion model for the effective projection
parameters, and show how to calibrate the basket to the index smile. Numerical
tests and calibration exercises demonstrate an excellent fit for a basket of as
many as 30 stocks with fast calculation time.

certain Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions whose effect is to require
bending. This leads to certain nonlinear (and nonconvex) variational problems

done by the load, in the case of a Neumann boundary condition). Our results
identify how the minimum value of each variational problem scales with respect

appropriate for a scanning space satellite such as Gaia. We apply it to the
first of the GAREQ fields, which is the fruit of dedicated efforts within the
Gaia project focused on measuring the relativistic deflection of light close to
Jupiter's limb. This provides a preliminary assessment of: a) the observability
of the relativistic deflection of light close to Jupiter, and, b) Gaia's
astrometric capabilities under extremely difficult conditions such as those
around a bright extended object. Inputs to our differential astrometric model
are the CCD transit times as measured by the IDU system, transformed to field
angles via AGIS geometric calibrations, and the commanded/nominal spacecraft
attitude. [abridged] To illustrate the model we analyze Gaia astrometric
measurements after their calibration through the latest cyclic EDR3/DR3
processing of the GAREQ event of Feb 2017. We use observations of the closest
bright target star successfully observed several times by Gaia in close
proximity to Jupiter and surrounding reference stars brighter than G<13 mag in
transits leading up to the time of closest approach and on subsequent transits.
The relativistic deflection signal is detected with a S/N of 50 at closest
approach by the target star. This signal is the combined effect due to Jupiter
and the Sun, mainly dominated by Jupiter's monopole, demonstrating Gaia's
scientific performance under extreme observational conditions. It is an
unprecedented detection for the following reasons: a) closest ever to Jupiter's
limb (~7"") in the optical, and, b) highest S/N at any wavelength. Finally, this
work sets the stage for investigations into disentangling the relativistic
quadrupole deflection due to Jupiter with future Gaia astrometric measurements.

the client level, is another important desideratum that has not been addressed

differential privacy, we first examine a simple algorithm that applies
compression directly to differentially-private stochastic gradient descent, and
identify its limitations. We then propose a unified framework SoteriaFL for
private federated learning, which accommodates a general family of local
gradient estimators including popular stochastic variance-reduced gradient
methods and the state-of-the-art shifted compression scheme. We provide a
comprehensive characterization of its performance trade-offs in terms of

achieve better communication complexity without sacrificing privacy nor utility
than other private federated learning algorithms without communication
compression.

$r$ and the spectral index $n_s$ for those models. Then the reheating
temperature $T_{re}$ and reheating duration $N_{re}$ are analytically derived.
Moreover, considering the CMB constraints, the feasible space of the SNI model
in $(n_s, r)$ plane is almost covered by that of the NII, which means the NII
is more general than the SNI. In addition, there is no overlapping space
between the ENI and the other two models in $(n_s, r)$ plane, which indicates
that the ENI and the other two models exclude each other, and more accurate
experiments can verify them. Furthermore, the reheating brings tighter
constraints to the inflation models, but they still work for a different
reheating universe. Considering the constraints of $n_s$, $r$, $N_k$ and
choosing $T_{re}$ near the electroweak energy scale, one can find that the
decay constants of the three models have no overlapping area and the effective
equations of state $\omega_{re}$ should be within $\frac{1}{4}\lesssim

Due to the lack of contrast with their environment, observing and studying

a series of EUV images covering an entire solar rotation, the average 3D
distribution of the thermal properties of the coronal plasma. By combining the
DEMT products with extrapolations of the global coronal magnetic field, we
reconstruct coronal loops and obtain the energy input required to keep them at
the typical million-degree temperatures of the corona. We statistically study a
large number of reconstructed loops for Carrington rotation (CR) 2082 obtaining
a series of typical average loops of different lengths. We look for relations
between the thermal properties and the lengths of the constructed typical loops
and find similar results to those found in a previous work
\citep{maccormack_2020}. We also analyze the typical loop properties by
comparing them with the zero-dimensional (0D) hydrodynamic model Enthalpy-Based
Thermal Evolution of Loops \citep[EBTEL, ][]{klimchuk_2008}. We explore two
heating scenarios. In the first one, we apply a constant heating rate assuming
that typical loops are in quasi-static equilibrium. In the second scenario we
heat the plasma in the loops using short impulsive events. We find that the
reconstructed typical loops are overdense with respect to quasi-static
equilibrium solutions of the hydrodynamic model. Impulsive heating, on the
other hand, reproduces better the observed densities and temperatures for the

we seek a non-perturbative solution of the associated spin-1 equation derived

Accordingly, we analyze the effects of spin of the point source and internal
magnetic flux on the relativistic dynamics of the considered test field. We see
that the spin of such a field can be altered by the magnetic flux and this
means that the considered system may behave as a fermion or boson according to
the varying values of the magnetic flux, in principle. We observe that the
internal magnetic flux and the spin of the point source impact on the

labeled LiDAR data, which is costly and time-consuming to annotate. In this
work, we aim to facilitate research on self-supervised masked learning using
the vast amount of unlabeled LiDAR data available in autonomous driving.
However, existing masked point autoencoding methods only focus on small-scale
indoor point clouds and struggle to adapt to outdoor scenes, which usually have
a large number of non-evenly distributed LiDAR points. To address these
challenges, we propose a new self-supervised masked learning method named
Occupancy-MAE, specifically designed for large-scale outdoor LiDAR points. We
leverage the gradually sparse occupancy structure of large-scale outdoor LiDAR
point clouds and introduce a range-aware random masking strategy and a pretext
task of occupancy prediction. Occupancy-MAE randomly masks voxels of LiDAR
point clouds based on their distance to LiDAR and predicts the masked occupancy
structure of the whole 3D scene. This simple occupancy prediction objective
encourages Occupancy-MAE to extract high-level semantic information to recover
the masked voxel from only a small amount of visible voxels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Occupancy-MAE across several
downstream tasks. For the 3D object detection task, Occupancy-MAE reduces the
labeled data required for car detection on KITTI by half and boosts small
object detection by around 2% mAP on Waymo. For the 3D semantic segmentation
task, Occupancy-MAE outperforms training from scratch by around 2% mIOU on
nuScenes. For the unsupervised domain adaptation task, Occupancy-MAE improves
the performance by about 0.5\% ~ 1% mAP. Our results show that it is feasible
to pre-train unlabeled large-scale LiDAR point clouds with masked autoencoding
to enhance the 3D perception ability of autonomous driving.

shows that the concentration of eigenvalues near the edges of the ESD

on this concentration is a more grounded assumption than complete knowledge of
the ESD. This approximate concentration is effectively a middle ground between
the coarseness of the worst-case scenario convergence and the restrictive
previous average-case analysis. We also introduce the Generalized Chebyshev
method, asymptotically optimal under a hypothesis on this concentration and
globally optimal when the ESD follows a Beta distribution. We compare its
performance to classical optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent or
Nesterov's scheme, and we show that, in the average-case context, Nesterov's

rehabilitation, and remote ultrasound scan. The experiments did not require any
adjustment of the robot tuning, which is essential in medical applications
where the operators do not have an engineering background required to tune the

timeline visualizations rarely consider spatio-temporal 3D data (e.g. mesh or

only displaying one time-step at a time. In this paper, leveraging the
increased workspace and 3D interaction capabilities of virtual reality, we
propose to use timelines for the visualization of 3D temporal data to support
exploration and analysis. First, we propose a timeline design space for 3D
temporal data extending the timeline design space proposed by Brehmer et al.
The proposed design space adapts the scale, layout and representation
dimensions to account for the depth dimension and how 3D temporal data can be
partitioned and structured. In our approach, an additional dimension is
introduced, the support, which further characterizes the 3D dimension of the
visualization. To complement the design space and the interaction capabilities
of VR systems, we discuss the interaction methods required for the efficient
visualization of 3D timelines. Then, to evaluate the benefits of 3D timelines,
we conducted a formal evaluation with two main objectives: comparing the
proposed visualization with a traditional visualization method; exploring how
users interact with different 3D timeline designs. Our results showed that
time-related tasks can be achieved more comfortably using timelines, and more
efficiently for specific tasks requiring the analysis of the surrounding
temporal context. Though the comparison between the different timeline designs
were inconclusive, participants reported a clear preference towards the
timeline design that did not occupy the vertical space. Finally, we illustrate
the use of the 3D timelines to a real use-case on the analysis of biological 3D

advantage of removing the hypothesis of the existence of a scaling symmetry for

integrates lexical representations with dense semantic representations by
densifying high-dimensional lexical representations into what we call
low-dimensional dense lexical representations (DLRs). Our experiments show that

to define an $l^1$-version of higher rho invariants. We prove a product formula
for these $l^1$-higher rho invariants. A main novelty of our product formula is
that it works in the general Banach algebra setting, in particular, the
$l^1$-setting.
  On compact spin manifolds with boundary, we also give a sufficient geometric
condition for Dirac operators to have well-defined $l^1$-higher indices. More
precisely, we show that, on a compact spin manifold $M$ with boundary equipped
with a Riemannian metric which has product structure near the boundary, if the
scalar curvature on the boundary is sufficiently large, then the $l^1$-higher
index of its Dirac operator $D_M$ is well-defined and lies in the $K$-theory of
the $l^1$-algebra of the fundamental group. As an immediate corollary, we see
that if the Bost conjecture holds for the fundamental group of $M$, then the
$C^\ast$-algebraic higher index of $D_M$ lies in the image of the Baum-Connes

confirm though the previously found result that loop-average temperatures at

investigated the photometric properties of a large sample of Galactic globular
clusters and revolutionized our understanding of their stellar populations. In
this paper, we expand previous studies by focusing our attention on the stellar
clusters' internal kinematics. We computed proper motions for stars in 56
globular and one open clusters by combining the GO-13297 images with archival
$\textit{HST}$ data. The astro-photometric catalogs released with this paper
represent the most complete and homogeneous collection of proper motions of
stars in the cores of stellar clusters to date, and expand the information
provided by the current (and future) $\textit{Gaia}$ data releases to much
fainter stars and into the crowded central regions. We also census the general
kinematic properties of stellar clusters by computing the velocity-dispersion
and anisotropy radial profiles of their bright members. We study the dependence
on concentration and relaxation time, and derive dynamical distances. Finally,
we present an in-depth kinematic analysis of the globular cluster NGC 5904.

using four highly-resolved $L^*$ galaxies from the Figuring Out Gas & Galaxies
In Enzo (FOGGIE) project. The FOGGIE simulations were specifically targeted at
fine spatial and mass resolution in the CGM ($\Delta x \lesssim 1$ kpc $h^{-1}$
and $M \simeq 200M_\odot$). We develop a new analysis framework that calculates
the forces provided by thermal pressure gradients, turbulent pressure
gradients, ram pressure gradients of large-scale radial bulk flows, centrifugal
rotation, and gravity acting on the gas in the CGM. Thermal and turbulent
pressure gradients vary strongly on scales of $\lesssim5$ kpc throughout the
CGM. Thermal pressure gradients provide the main supporting force only beyond
$\sim 0.25R_{200}$, or $\sim50$ kpc at $z=0$. Within $\sim0.25R_{200}$,
turbulent pressure gradients and rotational support provide stronger forces
than thermal pressure. More generally, we find that global equilibrium models
are neither appropriate nor predictive for the small scales probed by
absorption line observations of the CGM. Local conditions generally cannot be
derived by assuming a global equilibrium, but an emergent global equilibrium
balancing radially inward and outward forces is obtained when averaging over
the non-equilibrium local conditions on large scales in space and time.
Approximate hydrostatic equilibrium holds only at large distances from galaxies
even when averaging out small-scale variations.

given number of quantum channels, which is done by sending an input state
through a channel and measuring the output state. This work studies
applications of variational quantum circuits and machine learning techniques
for discriminating such channels. In particular, we explore (i) the practical
implementation of embedding this task into the framework of variational quantum
computing, (ii) training a quantum classifier based on variational quantum
circuits, and (iii) applying the quantum kernel estimation technique. For
testing these three channel discrimination approaches, we considered a pair of
entanglement-breaking channels and the depolarizing channel with two different
depolarization factors. For the approach (i), we address solving the quantum
channel discrimination problem using widely discussed parallel and sequential
strategies. We show the advantage of the latter in terms of better convergence
with less quantum resources. Quantum channel discrimination with a variational
quantum classifier (ii) allows one to operate even with random and mixed input
states and simple variational circuits. The kernel-based classification
approach (iii) is also found effective as it allows one to discriminate
depolarizing channels associated not with just fixed values of the
depolarization factor, but with ranges of it. Additionally, we discovered that
a simple modification of one of the commonly used kernels significantly
increases the efficiency of this approach. Finally, our numerical findings
reveal that the performance of variational methods of channel discrimination
depends on the trace of the product of the output states. These findings
demonstrate that quantum machine learning can be used to discriminate channels,
such as those representing physical noise processes.

understanding atmospheric composition and temperature structure. Here we report
on the analysis of spectral modulation using a large, uniformly processed
sample of HST/WFC3 transit spectra from 62 exoplanets. The spectral retrieval
includes the capability to detect and represent atmospheres in which the
composition departs from thermochemical equilibrium. By using this unique
catalog and measuring the dampening of spectral modulations compared to
strictly clear atmospheres, we identify two populations. One is completely
cloud/haze free spanning a wide temperature range, while the other population,
identified as ``Partial cloud/hazes'', follows a trend from mostly cloudy/hazy
around 500~K to mostly clear at $\sim$1500~K. We also find that a partially
transparent aerosol component is frequently present and that it is typically
vertically distributed throughout the atmospheric column. Our findings also
suggest that while clouds and hazes are common in exoplanet atmospheres, the
majority of planets have some level of detectable spectral modulation.

modelling the performance of large-scale transiting exoplanets survey, such as
planned with the Ariel mission. This trend can also be used for making a

received considerable attention in recent years with a view towards achieving
full electrical manipulation of magnetic degrees of freedom. The most important
question in this field concerns the relative contributions of bulk and surface
states to the spin torque, a matter that remains incompletely understood.
Whereas the surface state contribution has been extensively studied, the
contribution due to the bulk states has received comparatively little
attention. Here we study spin torques due to TI bulk states and show that: (i)
There is no spin-orbit torque due to the bulk states on a homogeneous
magnetisation, in contrast to the surface states, which give rise to a
spin-orbit torque via the well-known Edelstein effect. (ii) The bulk states
give rise to a spin transfer torque (STT) due to the inhomogeneity of the
magnetisation in the vicinity of the interface. This spin transfer torque,
which has not been considered in TIs in the past, is somewhat unconventional
since it arises from the interplay of the bulk TI spin-orbit coupling and the
gradient of the monotonically decaying magnetisation inside the TI. Whereas we
consider an idealised model in which the magnetisation gradient is small and
the spin transfer torque is correspondingly small, we argue that in real
samples the spin transfer torque should be sizable and may provide the dominant
contribution due to the bulk states. We show that an experimental smoking gun
for identifying the bulk states is the fact that the field-like component of
the spin transfer torque generates a spin density with the same size but
opposite sign for in-plane and out-of-plane magnetisations. This distinguishes
them from the surface states, which are expected to give a spin density of a
similar size and the same sign for both an in-plane and out-of-plane
magnetisations.

compensating on the line of sight of the quasar, and the derived column density
of the absorption appears under-estimated, with respect to the neighbouring
emission. A symmetric tilted-ring model of Klemola31A, assuming the absorbing
gas in regular rotation in the plane, yields a rather high spin temperature of
530K. An alternative interpretation is that the absorbing gas is extra-planar,
which will also account for its non-circular motion. The NaI/CaII ratio also
suggests that the absorbing gas is unrelated to cold HI disk. Two of the
galaxies in the Klemola group are interacting with a small companion, and
reveal typical tidal tails, and velocity perturbations. Only one of the

ram-pressure stripping, with a total asymmetry in the distribution of its gas.
Since a small galaxy group as Klemola31 is not expected to host a dense
intra-group gas, this galaxy must be crossing the group at a very high

governed by large-scale nonlinear systems of equations, including discretized
partial differential equations, using projection-based reduced-order models
accelerated with hyperreduction (empirical quadrature) and embedded in a
trust-region framework that guarantees global convergence. The proposed
framework constructs a hyperreduced model on-the-fly during the solution of the
optimization problem, which completely avoids an offline training phase. This
ensures all snapshot information is collected along the optimization
trajectory, which avoids wasting samples in remote regions of the parameters
space that are never visited, and inherently avoids the curse of dimensionality
of sampling in a high-dimensional parameter space. At each iteration of the
proposed algorithm, a reduced basis and empirical quadrature weights are
constructed precisely to ensure the global convergence criteria of the
trust-region method are satisfied, ensuring global convergence to a local
minimum of the original (unreduced) problem. Numerical experiments are
performed on two fluid shape optimization problems to verify the global
convergence of the method and demonstrate its computational efficiency;
speedups over 18x (accounting for all computational cost, even cost that is
traditionally considered ""offline"" such as snapshot collection and data
compression) relative to standard optimization approaches that do not leverage

key materials informatics tasks. The most common approach takes a data-driven
motivation, where the underlying knowledge is incorporated in the form of
domain-inspired input features. Machine learning (ML) models are then built to
establish the input-output relationships. An alternative approach involves
leveraging mechanistic models, where the domain knowledge is incorporated in a
predefined functional form. These mechanistic models are meticulously
formulated through observations to validate specific hypotheses, and
incorporate elements of causality missing from data-driven ML approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate a computational approach that integrates mechanistic
models with phenomenological and ML models to rapidly predict the
temperature-dependent yield strength of high entropy alloys (HEAs) that form in
the single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) structure. Our main contribution is
in establishing a quantitative relationship between the HEA compositions and
temperature-dependent elastic constants. This allows us to improve the
treatment of elastic constant mismatch to the solid solution strengthening
effect in the mechanistic model, which is important for reliable prediction of
yield strength as a function of temperature in single-phase FCC-based HEAs. We
accomplish this by combining Bayesian inference with ensemble ML methods. The
outcome is a probability distribution of elastic constants which, when
propagated through the mechanistic model, yields a prediction of
temperature-dependent yield strength, along with the uncertainties. The
predicted yield strength shows good agreement with published experimental data,
giving us confidence in applying the developed approach for the rapid search of
novel FCC-based HEAs with excellent yield strength at various temperatures.

indicate that the three delegitimizing frames - riot, confrontation, and

result of the collision with another nucleus, have been widely used as an
experimental tool, both to populate isotopes further removed from stability,
and to obtain information about the single-particle nature of the nuclear
spectrum. In order to fully exploit the experimental information, theory is
needed for the description of both the structure of the nuclei involved, and
the dynamics associated with the nucleon removal mechanisms. The standard
approach, using theoretical shell-model spectroscopic factors for the structure
description coupled with an eikonal model of reaction, has been successful when
used in the context of the removal of valence nucleons in nuclei close to
stability. However, it has been argued that the reaction theory might need to
be revisited in the case of exotic nuclei, more specifically for highly
asymmetric nuclei in which the deficient species (neutrons or protons) is being
removed. We present here a new formalism for the nucleon-removal and -addition
reaction through knockout and transfer reactions, that treats consistently
structure and reaction properties using dispersive optical potentials. In
particular, our formalism includes the dynamical effects associated with the
removal of a neutron from the projectile, which might explain the long standing
puzzle of the quenching of spectroscopic factors in nuclei with extreme

description of dust is to analyse highly reddened SNe Ia ($E(B-V)>0.4$, roughly
equivalent to the fitted SALT2 light-curve parameter $c>0.3$). With the
recently released Pantheon+ sample, there are 57 SNe Ia that were removed
because of their high colour alone (with colours up to $c=1.61$), which can
provide enormous leverage on understanding line-of-sight $R_V$. Previous
studies have claimed that $R_V$ decreases with redder colour, though it is
unclear if this is due to limited statistics, selection effects, or an
alternative explanation. To test this claim, we fit two separate
colour-luminosity relationships, one for the main cosmological sample ($c<0.3$)
and one for highly reddened ($c>0.3$) SNe Ia. We find the change in the
colour-luminosity coefficient to be consistent with zero. Additionally, we
compare the data to simulations with different colour models, and find that the
data prefers a model with a flat dependence of $R_V$ on colour over a declining
dependence. Finally, our results strongly support that line-of-sight $R_V$ to
SNe Ia is not a single value, but forms a distribution.

applications. A recently proposed influence metric, coined as $\psi$-score,
allows to go beyond traditional centrality metrics, which only assess
structural graph importance, by further incorporating the rich information
provided by the posting and re-posting activity of users. The $\psi$-score is
shown in fact to generalize PageRank for non-homogeneous node activity. Despite
its significance, it scales poorly to large datasets; for a network of $N$
users, it requires to solve $N$ linear systems of equations of size $N$. To
address this problem, this work introduces a novel scalable algorithm for the
fast approximation of $\psi$-score, named \textit{Power}-$\psi$. The proposed
algorithm is based on a novel equation indicating that it suffices to solve one
system of equations of size $N$ to compute the $\psi$-score. Then, our
algorithm exploits the fact that such a system can be recursively and
distributedly approximated to any desired error. This permits the $\psi$-score,
summarizing both structural and behavioral information for the nodes, to run as
fast as PageRank. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm,
which we release as an open source Python library, on several real-world
datasets.

equations are an important family of continuous-time dynamic decision-making
models. Optimal policies are well-studied for them, under full certainty about
the drift matrices. However, little is known about data-driven control of
diffusion processes with uncertain drift matrices as conventional discrete-time
analysis techniques are not applicable. In addition, while the task can be
viewed as a reinforcement learning problem involving exploration and
exploitation trade-off, ensuring system stability is a fundamental component of
designing optimal policies. We establish that the popular Thompson sampling
algorithm learns optimal actions fast, incurring only a square-root of time
regret, and also stabilizes the system in a short time period. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first such result for Thompson sampling in a
diffusion process control problem. We validate our theoretical results through
empirical simulations with real parameter matrices from two settings of
airplane and blood glucose control. Moreover, we observe that Thompson sampling
significantly improves (worst-case) regret, compared to the state-of-the-art
algorithms, suggesting Thompson sampling explores in a more guarded fashion.
Our theoretical analysis involves characterization of a certain optimality
manifold that ties the local geometry of the drift parameters to the optimal
control of the diffusion process. We expect this technique to be of broader
interest.

DG tackle data heterogeneity from the algorithmic perspective, recent evidence
suggests that data augmentation can induce equal or greater performance.
Motivated by this connection, we present federated versions of popular DG

mitigate data heterogeneity in the federated setting, and obtain higher
accuracy on unseen clients. Equipped with data augmentation, we can achieve

method can be viewed as follows. We can modify the shape of the distribution of
observed BBH events by changing cosmological parameters until it eventually
matches the distribution constructed from an astrophysical population model,
thereby allowing us to determine the cosmological parameters. In this work, we
derive the Cram\'er-Rao bound for both cosmological parameters and those
governing the astrophysical population model from this statistical dark siren

Our study provides analytical insights and enables fast yet accurate

we consider the bias in cosmology due to unmodeled substructures in the merger
rate and the mass distribution. We find a $1\%$ deviation in the astrophysical

collection of entities. Recent work in the literature has independently
considered when (i) one observes a sample of networks, connectome data in

this paper, we propose a new Bayesian modelling framework to analyse such data.
Given a practitioner-specified distance metric between observations, we define
families of models through location and scale parameters, akin to a Gaussian
distribution, with subsequent inference of model parameters providing reasoned
statistical summaries for this non-standard data structure. To facilitate
inference, we propose specialised Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes
capable of sampling from doubly-intractable posterior distributions over
discrete and multi-dimensional parameter spaces. Through simulation studies we
confirm the efficacy of our methodology and inference scheme, whilst its
application we illustrate via an example analysis of a location-based social

  Study Using Real DRAM Devices","To appear in DSN 2022",,,,"cs.AR cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  RowHammer is a circuit-level DRAM vulnerability, where repeatedly activating
and precharging a DRAM row, and thus alternating the voltage of a row's
wordline between low and high voltage levels, can cause bit flips in physically
nearby rows. Recent DRAM chips are more vulnerable to RowHammer: with
technology node scaling, the minimum number of activate-precharge cycles to
induce a RowHammer bit flip reduces and the RowHammer bit error rate increases.
Therefore, it is critical to develop effective and scalable approaches to
protect modern DRAM systems against RowHammer. To enable such solutions, it is
essential to develop a deeper understanding of the RowHammer vulnerability of
modern DRAM chips. However, even though the voltage toggling on a wordline is a
key determinant of RowHammer vulnerability, no prior work experimentally
demonstrates the effect of wordline voltage (VPP) on the RowHammer
vulnerability. Our work closes this gap in understanding.
  This is the first work to experimentally demonstrate on 272 real DRAM chips
that lowering VPP reduces a DRAM chip's RowHammer vulnerability. We show that
lowering VPP 1) increases the number of activate-precharge cycles needed to
induce a RowHammer bit flip by up to 85.8% with an average of 7.4% across all
tested chips and 2) decreases the RowHammer bit error rate by up to 66.9% with
an average of 15.2% across all tested chips. At the same time, reducing VPP
marginally worsens a DRAM cell's access latency, charge restoration, and data
retention time within the guardbands of system-level nominal timing parameters
for 208 out of 272 tested chips. We conclude that reducing VPP is a promising
strategy for reducing a DRAM chip's RowHammer vulnerability without requiring
modifications to DRAM chips.

explore the utility of deriving muscle fiber orientations from diffusion tensor
MRI (DT-MRI) for defining the boundary of the clinical target volume in muscle

the left and right thigh. The imaging session consisted of (a) two MRI
spin-echo-based scans, T1- and T2-weighted; (b) a diffusion weighted (DW)
spin-echo-based scan using an echo planar acquisition with fat suppression. The
thigh muscles were auto-segmented using CNN. DT-MRI data was used as a geometry
encoding input to solve the anisotropic Eikonal equation with Hamiltonian
Fast-Marching method. The isosurfaces of the solution modeled the CTV boundary.
Main results: The auto-segmented muscles of the thigh agreed with manually
delineated with the Dice score ranging from 0.8 to 0.94 for different muscles.
Anisotropy of the isosurfaces was compared across muscles with different
anatomical orientations within a thigh, between muscles in left and right
thighs of each subject, and between different subjects. Analysis showed a high
degree of consistency across all comparisons. The distance from the GTV to the
isosurface and the eigenvalues ratio are two controlling parameters for the
extent and shape of the CTV. Significance: Our feasibility study with healthy
volunteers shows the promise of using muscle fiber orientations derived from
diffusion weighted MRI data for automated generation of anisotropic CTV
boundary in soft tissue sarcoma. Our contribution is significant as it is
expected to lead to the improvements in the treatment outcomes of soft-tissue
sarcoma patients undergoing radiotherapy and decrease amputation rate for a
subset of patients. We expect such improvements to have a strong positive
impact for the cancer centers with small volume of sarcoma patients.

This raises the question of when re-initialization works, and whether it should

weight decay and learning rate schedules. In this work, we conduct an extensive
empirical comparison of standard training with a selection of re-initialization
methods to answer this question, training over 15,000 models on a variety of

consistently beneficial for generalization in the absence of any other

regularization techniques, re-initialization methods offer little to no added
benefit for generalization, although optimal generalization performance becomes
less sensitive to the choice of learning rate and weight decay hyperparameters.

consider learning under label noise. Surprisingly, in this case,
re-initialization significantly improves upon standard training, even in the

Process (POMDP) planning system that addresses the problem of autonomous

Popular approaches to this problem first generate a path using a complete
planner (e.g., Hybrid A*) with ad-hoc assumptions about uncertainty, then use
online tree-based POMDP solvers to reason about uncertainty with control over a
limited aspect of the problem (i.e. speed along the path). We present a more
capable and responsive real-time approach enabling the POMDP planner to control
more degrees of freedom (e.g., both speed AND heading) to achieve more flexible
and efficient solutions. This modification greatly extends the region of the
state space that the POMDP planner must reason over, significantly increasing
the importance of finding effective roll-out policies within the limited
computational budget that real time control affords. Our key insight is to use
multi-query motion planning techniques (e.g., Probabilistic Roadmaps or Fast
Marching Method) as priors for rapidly generating efficient roll-out policies
for every state that the POMDP planning tree might reach during its limited

  Contribution via a Fully Data-Driven Method",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a new comprehensive and fully data-driven methodology to
estimate the center of inertia (COI) and the regional inertia, considering the
displacement of the COI due to disturbances and load inertial contributions.
The strategy uses the typicality-based data analysis (TDA) technique to detect
the right pilot-bus that represents the COI. In the TDA, a compound of
correlation and cosine similarities is implemented to approximate the actual
distribution of the data and find the point (bus) closest to the mean which is
elected as the pilot-bus. Then, the frequency response at the pilot-bus and the
active power deviations are embedded into an autoregressive moving average
exogenous input (ARMAX)-based approach to determine the regional inertia
represented by an equivalent machine, whose inertia constant corresponds to the
inertial contribution in the Region. % the This is done in order to perform the
inertial estimation of the region using the frequency response of the pilot-bus
and the active power of the region interconnections to model the region as and
equivalent machine whose inertial constant is estimated using ARMAX
identification technique. The methodology is tested using the IEEE 68-bus
benchmark test system and an adapted version with aggregated dynamical loads,
corroborating the method effectiveness.

identified in the globular cluster M13. The cooling time of these stars is
increased by stable thermonuclear hydrogen burning in their residual envelope.
These WDs are thought to be originated by horizontal branch (HB) stars
populating the HB blue tail, which skipped the asymptotic giant branch phase.
To further explore this phenomenon, we took advantage of deep photometric data
acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope in the near-ultraviolet and
investigate the bright portion of the WD cooling sequence in NGC 6752, another
Galactic globular cluster with metallicity, age and HB morphology similar to
M13. The normalized WD luminosity function derived in NGC 6752 turns out to be
impressively similar to that observed in M13, in agreement with the fact that
the stellar mass distribution along the HB of these two systems is almost
identical. As in the case of M13, the comparison with theoretical predictions
is consistent with $\sim 70\%$ of the investigated WDs evolving at slower rates
than standard, purely cooling WDs. Thanks to its relatively short distance from
Earth, NGC 6752 photometry reaches a luminosity one order of a magnitude
fainter than the case of M13, allowing us to sample a regime where the cooling
time delay, with respect to standard WD models, reaches $\sim 300$ Myr. The
results presented in this paper provide new evidence for the existence of
slowly cooling WDs and further support to the scenario proposing a direct
causal connection between this phenomenon and the horizontal branch morphology
of the host stellar cluster.

the instability tongues in Mathieu-type equations lose sharpness with the

this paper we find a third class of objects where a similarly flavored behavior

that periodic orbits of standard maps are extra fragile with respect to added
drift (i.e. non-exactness) if the potential of the map is a trigonometric
polynomial. That is, higher-frequency harmonics make periodic orbits more
robust with respect to ``drift"". The observation was motivated by the study of

novel fair representation learning method termed the R\'enyi Fair Information
Bottleneck Method (RFIB) which incorporates constraints for utility, fairness,
and compactness (compression) of representation, and apply it to image and
tabular data classification. A key attribute of our approach is that we
consider - in contrast to most prior work - both demographic parity and
equalized odds as fairness constraints, allowing for a more nuanced
satisfaction of both criteria. Leveraging a variational approach, we show that
our objectives yield a loss function involving classical Information Bottleneck
(IB) measures and establish an upper bound in terms of two R\'enyi measures of
order $\alpha$ on the mutual information IB term measuring compactness between
the input and its encoded embedding. We study the influence of the $\alpha$
parameter as well as two other tunable IB parameters on achieving
utility/fairness trade-off goals, and show that the $\alpha$ parameter gives an
additional degree of freedom that can be used to control the compactness of the
representation. Experimenting on three different image datasets (EyePACS,
CelebA, and FairFace) and two tabular datasets (Adult and COMPAS), using both

sidestepping this limitation by bringing AI-based solutions to data owners and
only sharing local AI models, or parts thereof, that need then to be
aggregated. However, most of the existing federated learning solutions are
still at their infancy and show several shortcomings, from the lack of a
reliable and effective aggregation scheme able to retain the knowledge learned
locally to weak privacy preservation as real data may be reconstructed from

cost is called the capacity. The main contribution of this paper is the exact
capacity characterization for the $K=3$ user LCBC for all cases, i.e., for
arbitrary finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, arbitrary data dimension $d$, and
arbitrary linear side-informations and demands at each user. A remarkable
aspect of the converse is that unlike the $2$ user LCBC whose capacity was
determined previously, the entropic formulation (where the entropies of demands

insufficient to obtain a tight converse for the $3$ user LCBC. Instead, the
converse exploits functional submodularity. Notable aspects of achievability
include a decomposition of the users' collective signal space into subspaces
that allow different degrees of efficiency in broadcast cost, revealing a
tradeoff that leads to a constrained water-filling solution. Random coding
arguments are invoked to resolve compatibility issues that arise as each user

Galactic Nuclei (CL AGNs). Here, we focus on the spectral fitting and analysis
of broad emission lines in an exhaustive sample of 112 CL AGNs available in the
literature with existing SDSS/BOSS/eBOSS spectroscopy. Additionally, we have
gathered older/newer spectral epochs from all the available SDSS data releases
to make the database more complete. We use PyQSOFit and perform a homogeneous
spectral decomposition of all of our SDSS spectra and tabulate the AGN
continuum and emission-line properties per epoch per source, chronologically.
This further allows us to categorize the sources in our sample as Turn-On or
Turn-Off and subsequently check for repeated occurrences of such phases. We
then estimate the black hole mass (M$_{\rm BH}$) and the Eddington ratio
($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) per epoch per source where the required parameters are
available and well-estimated. We realize the movement of the source in the
M$_{\rm BH}$-$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ plane allowing us to check for systematic
changes in the source's fundamental properties. We then track their transition
along the optical plane of the Eigenvector 1 (EV1) schema and categorize
sources that either stay within the same Population (A or B) or make an
inter-population movement as a function of spectral epoch. We also test the
Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$) of a subset of our sample of CL AGNs as a
function of time and AGN luminosity.

shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations to state

robustness of reinforcement learning can nevertheless tolerate only very small
perturbations, and remain fragile as perturbation size increases. We propose
Bootstrapped Opportunistic Adversarial Curriculum Learning (BCL), a novel
flexible adversarial curriculum learning framework for robust reinforcement
learning. Our framework combines two ideas: conservatively bootstrapping each
curriculum phase with highest quality solutions obtained from multiple runs of
the previous phase, and opportunistically skipping forward in the curriculum.
In our experiments we show that the proposed BCL framework enables dramatic
improvements in robustness of learned policies to adversarial perturbations.
The greatest improvement is for Pong, where our framework yields robustness to
perturbations of up to 25/255; in contrast, the best existing approach can only
tolerate adversarial noise up to 5/255. Our code is available at:

coherent sentences. Most existing methods model the coherence through the topic
transition that dynamically infers a topic vector from preceding sentences.
However, these methods still suffer from immediate or delayed repetitions in
generated paragraphs because (i) the entanglement of syntax and semantics
distracts the topic vector from attending pertinent visual regions; (ii) there
are few constraints or rewards for learning long-range transitions. In this
paper, we propose a bypass network that separately models semantics and
linguistic syntax of preceding sentences. Specifically, the proposed model
consists of two main modules, i.e. a topic transition module and a sentence
generation module. The former takes previous semantic vectors as queries and
applies attention mechanism on regional features to acquire the next topic
vector, which reduces immediate repetition by eliminating linguistics. The
latter decodes the topic vector and the preceding syntax state to produce the
following sentence. To further reduce delayed repetition in generated
paragraphs, we devise a replacement-based reward for the REINFORCE training.
Comprehensive experiments on the widely used benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed model over the state of the art for coherence while
maintaining high accuracy.

environmental variables and is important in applications such as navigating ice
breaker ships. Research for both modeling and simulating sea ice dynamics is
ongoing, with the most widely accepted model based on the viscous-plastic (VP)
formulation introduced by Hibler in 1979. Due to its highly nonlinear features,
this model is intrinsically challenging for computational solvers. In
particular, sea ice simulations often significantly differ from satellite
observations. This study therefore focuses on improving the numerical accuracy
of the VP sea ice model. Since the poor convergence observed in existing
numerical simulations stems from the nonlinear nature of the VP formulation,
this investigation proposes using the celebrated weighted essentially
non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme -- as opposed to the frequently employed centered
difference (CD) scheme -- for the spatial derivatives in the VP sea ice model.
We then proceed to numerically demonstrate that WENO yields higher-order
convergence for smooth solutions, and that furthermore it is able to resolve
the discontinuities in the sharp features of sea ice covers -- something that
is not possible using CD methods. Finally, our proposed framework integrates a
potential function method that utilizes the phase field method to naturally
incorporates the physical restrictions of ice thickness and ice concentration
in transport equations, resulting in a modified transport equations which
includes additional forcing terms. Our method does not require post-processing,
thereby avoiding the possible introduction of discontinuities and corresponding
negative impact on the solution behavior. Numerical experiments are provided to
demonstrate the efficacy of our new methodology.

applications in engineering, architecture, designs, etc. The VG recognition
process of most existing methods is to first render the VG into raster graphics
(RG) and then conduct recognition based on RG formats. However, this procedure
discards the structure of geometries and loses the high resolution of VG.
Recently, another category of algorithms is proposed to recognize directly from
the original VG format. But it is affected by the topological errors that can
be filtered out by RG rendering. Instead of looking at one format, it is a good
solution to utilize the formats of VG and RG together to avoid these
shortcomings. Besides, we argue that the VG-to-RG rendering process is
essential to effectively combine VG and RG information. By specifying the rules
on how to transfer VG primitives to RG pixels, the rendering process depicts
the interaction and correlation between VG and RG. As a result, we propose
RendNet, a unified architecture for recognition on both 2D and 3D scenarios,
which considers both VG/RG representations and exploits their interaction by
incorporating the VG-to-RG rasterization process. Experiments show that RendNet
can achieve state-of-the-art performance on 2D and 3D object recognition tasks

halos identified via the SPARTA code as a function of their splashback masses
at various redshifts for two different cases of $\sum m_{\nu}=0.0$ eV and $0.1$
eV. Then, we fit the numerical results to the recently developed analytic
formula characterized by the diffusion coefficient that quantifies the degree
of ambiguity in the identification of the splashback boundaries. Our analysis
confirms that the analytic formula works excellently even in the presence of
neutrinos and that the decrement of its diffusion coefficient with redshift is
well described by a linear fit, $B(z-z_{c})$, in the redshift range of $0.2\le
z\le 2$. It turns out that the massive neutrino case yields significantly lower
value of $B$ and substantially higher value of $z_{c}$ than the massless
neutrino case, which indicates that the higher masses the neutrinos have, the
more severely the splashback boundaries become disturbed by the surroundings.
Given our result, we conclude that the total neutrino mass can in principle be
constrained by measuring how rapidly the diffusion coefficient of the
splashback mass function diminishes with redshifts at $z\ge 0.2$. We also
discuss the anomalous behavior of the diffusion coefficient found at lower

distance, Jaccard distance, has been shown to offer a good reflection of the

distributions. Finally, we use well-established statistical tools to gauge the
(dis)similarities in terms of probability distribution (dis)similarity. This
comparison procedure aims to detect (dis)similarities in connectivity

vary greatly. When facing density variation, humans tend to locate and count
the targets in low-density regions, and reason the number in high-density
regions. We observe that CNN focus on the local information correlation using a
fixed-size convolution kernel and the Transformer could effectively extract the
semantic crowd information by using the global self-attention mechanism. Thus,
CNN could locate and estimate crowds accurately in low-density regions, while
it is hard to properly perceive the densities in high-density regions. On the
contrary, Transformer has a high reliability in high-density regions, but fails
to locate the targets in sparse regions. Neither CNN nor Transformer can well
deal with this kind of density variation. To address this problem, we propose a
CNN and Transformer Adaptive Selection Network (CTASNet) which can adaptively
select the appropriate counting branch for different density regions. Firstly,
CTASNet generates the prediction results of CNN and Transformer. Then,
considering that CNN/Transformer is appropriate for low/high-density regions, a
density guided adaptive selection module is designed to automatically combine
the predictions of CNN and Transformer. Moreover, to reduce the influences of
annotation noise, we introduce a Correntropy based optimal transport loss.
Extensive experiments on four challenging crowd counting datasets have
validated the proposed method.

prospective applications in quantum metrology, secure quantum communication,

methods that limit the scalability of typical generation schemes in optical
systems. Here we present an experimental implementation in the microwave domain
of a resource-efficient scheme for the deterministic generation of 2D photonic
cluster states. By utilizing a coupled resonator array as a slow-light
waveguide, a single flux-tunable transmon qubit as a quantum emitter, and a
second auxiliary transmon as a switchable mirror, we achieve rapid, shaped
emission of entangled photon wavepackets, and selective time-delayed feedback
of photon wavepackets to the emitter qubit. We leverage these capabilities to
generate a 2D cluster state of four photons with 70\% fidelity, as verified by
tomographic reconstruction of the quantum state. We discuss how our scheme
could be straightforwardly extended to the generation of even larger cluster
states, of even higher dimension, thereby expanding the scope and practical
utility of such states for quantum information processing tasks.

matter (DM) are often assumed sufficiently mixed that both components
experience identical tidal torques. However, haloes in cosmological simulations
consistently end up with a higher specific angular momentum (sAM) in gas, even
in simulations without radiative cooling and galaxy formation physics. We
refine this result by analysing the spin distributions of gas and DM in
$\sim$50,000 well-resolved haloes in a non-radiative cosmological simulation
from the SURFS suite. The sAM of the halo gas on average ends up $\sim$40\%
above that of the DM. This can be pinned down to an excess AM in the inner halo
($<$50\% virial radius), paralleled by a more coherent rotation pattern in the
gas. We uncover the leading driver for this AM difference through a series of
control simulations of a collapsing ellipsoidal top-hat, where gas and DM are
initially well mixed. These runs reveal that the pressurised inner gas shells
collapse more slowly, causing the DM ellipsoid to spin ahead of the gas
ellipsoid. The arising torque generally transfers AM from the DM to the gas.
The amount of AM transferred via this mode depends on the initial spin, the
initial axes ratios and the collapse factor. These quantities can be combined
in a single dimensionless parameter, which robustly predicts the AM transfer of
the ellipsoidal collapse. This simplistic model can quantitatively explain the
average AM excess of the gas found in the more complex non-radiative
cosmological simulation.

of its final mass through gas accretion at a rapid rate. This work determines
the density and velocity fields for material falling onto the central planet
and its circumplanetary disk, and finds the corresponding column density of
this infalling envelope. We derive a steady-state solution for the surface
density of the disk as a function of its viscosity (including the limiting case
where no disk accretion occurs). Planetary magnetic fields truncate the inner
edge of the disk and determine the boundary conditions for mass accretion onto
the planet from both direct infall and from the disk. The properties of the
forming planet and its circumplanetary disk are determined, including the
luminosity contributions from infall onto the planet and disk surfaces, and
from disk viscosity. The radiative signature of the planet formation process is
explored using a quasi-spherical treatment of the emergent spectral energy
distributions. The analytic solutions developed herein show how the protoplanet
properties (envelope density distribution, velocity field, column density, disk
surface density, luminosity, and radiative signatures) vary with input

poses several challenges due to practical scenarios where real-world scenes are
complex and only partial annotations are available, leading to incompelete or
false estimations. In this work, we present a novel framework to detect the
densepose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method, which we refer
to Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN), tackles two main problems: 1) how to
refine image representation for alleviating incomplete estimations, and 2) how
to reduce false estimation caused by the low-quality training labels (i.e.,
limited annotations and class-imbalance labels). Unlike existing works directly
propagating the pyramidal features of regions for densepose estimation, the KTN
uses a refinement of pyramidal representation, where it simultaneously
maintains feature resolution and suppresses background pixels, and this
strategy results in a substantial increase in accuracy. Moreover, the KTN
enhances the ability of 3D based body parsing with external knowledges, where
it casts 2D based body parsers trained from sufficient annotations as a 3D
based body parser through a structural body knowledge graph. In this way, it
significantly reduces the adverse effects caused by the low-quality
annotations. The effectiveness of KTN is demonstrated by its superior
performance to the state-of-the-art methods on DensePose-COCO dataset.
Extensive ablation studies and experimental results on representative tasks
(e.g., human body segmentation, human part segmentation and keypoints
detection) and two popular densepose estimation pipelines (i.e., RCNN and
fully-convolutional frameworks), further indicate the generalizability of the

computationally efficient neural network-based functional model to construct a
correction term added upon a cheap DFT model. Upon training, DeePKS offers
closely-matched energies and forces compared with high-level QM method, but the
number of training data required is orders of magnitude less than that required

  Generation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been found that temporal action proposal generation, which aims to
discover the temporal action instances within the range of the start and end
frames in the untrimmed videos, can largely benefit from proper temporal and
semantic context exploitation. The latest efforts were dedicated to considering
the temporal context and similarity-based semantic contexts through
self-attention modules. However, they still suffer from cluttered background
information and limited contextual feature learning. In this paper, we propose
a novel Pyramid Region-based Slot Attention (PRSlot) module to address these
issues. Instead of using the similarity computation, our PRSlot module directly
learns the local relations in an encoder-decoder manner and generates the
representation of a local region enhanced based on the attention over input
features called \textit{slot}. Specifically, upon the input snippet-level
features, PRSlot module takes the target snippet as \textit{query}, its
surrounding region as \textit{key} and then generates slot representations for
each \textit{query-key} slot by aggregating the local snippet context with a
parallel pyramid strategy. Based on PRSlot modules, we present a novel Pyramid
Region-based Slot Attention Network termed PRSA-Net to learn a unified visual
representation with rich temporal and semantic context for better proposal
generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two widely adopted THUMOS14
and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks. Our PRSA-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, we improve the AR@100 from the previous best 50.67% to
56.12% for proposal generation and raise the mAP under 0.5 tIoU from 51.9\% to
58.7\% for action detection on THUMOS14. \textit{Code is available at}

  Multi-View Mammograms",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in various
medical imaging tasks. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution
operation, CNNs generally cannot model long-range dependencies well, which are
important for accurately identifying or mapping corresponding breast lesion
features computed from unregistered multiple mammograms. This motivates us to
leverage the architecture of Multi-view Vision Transformers to capture
long-range relationships of multiple mammograms from the same patient in one
examination. For this purpose, we employ local Transformer blocks to separately
learn patch relationships within four mammograms acquired from two-view
(CC/MLO) of two-side (right/left) breasts. The outputs from different views and
sides are concatenated and fed into global Transformer blocks, to jointly learn
patch relationships between four images representing two different views of the
left and right breasts. To evaluate the proposed model, we retrospectively
assembled a dataset involving 949 sets of mammograms, which include 470
malignant cases and 479 normal or benign cases. We trained and evaluated the
model using a five-fold cross-validation method. Without any arduous
preprocessing steps (e.g., optimal window cropping, chest wall or pectoral
muscle removal, two-view image registration, etc.), our four-image
(two-view-two-side) Transformer-based model achieves case classification
performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC = 0.818), which significantly
outperforms AUC = 0.784 achieved by the state-of-the-art multi-view CNNs (p =
0.009). It also outperforms two one-view-two-side models that achieve AUC of
0.724 (CC view) and 0.769 (MLO view), respectively. The study demonstrates the
potential of using Transformers to develop high-performing computer-aided
diagnosis schemes that combine four mammograms.

monocular 3D lane detection by leveraging geometry structure underneath the
process of 2D to 3D lane reconstruction. Inspired by previous methods, we first
analyze the geometry heuristic between the 3D lane and its 2D representation on
the ground and propose to impose explicit supervision based on the structure
prior, which makes it achievable to build inter-lane and intra-lane
relationships to facilitate the reconstruction of 3D lanes from local to
global. Second, to reduce the structure loss in 2D lane representation, we
directly extract BEV lane information from front view images, which
tremendously eases the confusion of distant lane features in previous methods.
Furthermore, we propose a novel task-specific data augmentation method by
synthesizing new training data for both segmentation and reconstruction tasks
in our pipeline, to counter the imbalanced data distribution of camera pose and
ground slope to improve generalization on unseen data. Our work marks the first
attempt to employ the geometry prior information into DNN-based 3D lane
detection and makes it achievable for detecting lanes in an extra-long
distance, doubling the original detection range. The proposed method can be
smoothly adopted by other frameworks without extra costs. Experimental results
show that our work outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 3.8% F-Score on

self-sustained transportation energy systems and have been widely deployed in
the last few years. To realize reliable battery maintenance, identifying its
electrochemical parameters is necessary. However, the battery model contains
many parameters while the measurable states are only the current and voltage,
inducing the identification inherently an ill-conditioned problem. A parameter
identification approach is proposed, including the experiment, model, and
algorithm. Electrochemical parameters are first grouped manually based on the
physical properties and assigned to two sequenced tests for identification. The
two tests named the quasi-static test and the dynamic test, are compressed on
time for practical implementation. Proper optimization models and a
sensitivity-oriented stepwise (SSO) optimization algorithm are developed to
search for the optimal parameters efficiently. Typically, the Sobol method is
applied to conduct the sensitivity analysis. Based on the sensitivity indexes,
the SSO algorithm can decouple the mixed impacts of different parameters during
the identification. For validation, numerical experiments on a typical NCM811
battery at different life stages are conducted. The proposed approach saves
about half the time finding the proper parameter value. The identification
accuracy of crucial parameters related to battery degradation can exceed 95\%.
Case study results indicate that the identified parameters can not only improve
the accuracy of the battery model but also be used as the indicator of the
battery SOH.

was typical of solar minimum, with a dipole field dominance showcased by large
polar coronal holes and a broad equatorial streamer belt. The Fe XI line is
found to be the brightest, followed by Fe X and Fe XIV (in disk $B_\odot$
units). All lines had brightness variations between streamers and coronal
holes, where Fe XIV exhibited the largest variation. However, Fe X remained
surprisingly uniform with latitude. The Fe line brightnesses are used to infer
the relative ionic abundances and line of sight averaged electron temperature
($T_e$) throughout the corona, yielding values from 1.25 - 1.4 MK in coronal

underestimated the observationally inferred $T_e$ within 5 to 10 % averaged

central role of the microbiome in disease and health. Differential abundance
analysis aims to identify microbial taxa associated with two or more sample
groups defined by attributes such as disease subtype, geography, or
environmental condition. The results, in turn, help clinical practitioners and
researchers diagnose disease and develop new treatments more effectively.
However, detecting differential abundance is uniquely challenging due to the
high dimensionality, collinearity, sparsity, and compositionality of microbiome
data. Further, there is a critical need for unified statistical approaches that
can directly compare more than two groups and appropriately adjust for
covariates. We develop a zero-inflated Bayesian nonparametric (ZIBNP)
methodology that meets the multipronged challenges posed by microbiome data and
identifies differentially abundant taxa in two or more groups, while also
accounting for sample-specific covariates. The proposed hierarchical model
flexibly adapts to unique data characteristics, casts the typically high
proportion of zeros in a censoring framework, and mitigates high dimensionality
and collinearity issues by utilizing the dimension reducing property of the
semiparametric Chinese restaurant process. The approach relates the microbiome
sampling depths to inferential precision and conforms with the compositional
nature of microbiome data. In simulation studies and in the analyses of the
CAnine Microbiome during Parasitism (CAMP) data on infected and uninfected
dogs, and the Global Gut microbiome data on human subjects belonging to three

These algorithms either modify a given cover text or directly generate a text
containing secret information, which, however, are not reversible, meaning that
the original text not carrying secret information cannot be perfectly recovered
unless much side information are shared in advance. To tackle with this
problem, in this paper, we propose a general framework to embed secret
information into a given cover text, for which the embedded information and the
original cover text can be perfectly retrieved from the marked text. The main
idea of the proposed method is to use a masked language model to generate such
a marked text that the cover text can be reconstructed by collecting the words
of some positions and the words of the other positions can be processed to
extract the secret information. Our results show that the original cover text
and the secret information can be successfully embedded and extracted.
Meanwhile, the marked text carrying secret information has good fluency and
semantic quality, indicating that the proposed method has satisfactory
security, which has been verified by experimental results. Furthermore, there
is no need for the data hider and data receiver to share the language model,
which significantly reduces the side information and thus has good potential in
applications.

including a moving kernel corresponding to a flare loop footpoint in Si IV, C

were mostly redshifted and exhibited pronounced red wings, as typically
observed in large flares. However, in a small region in one of the ribbons, the
Si IV 1402.77{\AA} line was partially blueshifted, with the corresponding
Doppler velocity |v_{D}| exceeding 50 km s$^{-1}$. In the same region, the C II
1334.53{\AA}, 1335.66{\AA} and 1335.71{\AA} lines were weakly blueshifted
(|v_{D}| < 20 km s$^{-1}$) and showed pronounced blue wings, which were
observed also in the Mg II k 2796.35{\AA} as well as the Mg II triplet
2798.75{\AA} and 2798.82{\AA} lines. Using high-cadence AIA observations we
found that the region where the blueshifts occurred corresponds to the
accelerating kernel front as it moved through a weak-field region. The IRIS
observations with high resolution allowed us to capture the acceleration of the

blueshifted chromospheric and TR lines provide new constrains for current

simulation of temperature control curve of reflow furnace is crucial for
selecting proper parameters and improving the overall efficiency of reflow
soldering process and product quality. According to the heat conduction law and
the specific heat capacity formula, the first-order ordinary differential
equation of the central temperature curve of the welding area with respect to
the temperature distribution function in the furnace on the conveyor belt
displacement is obtained. For the gap with small temperature difference, the
sigmoid function is used to obtain a smooth interval temperature transition
curve; For the gap with large temperature difference, the linear combination of
exponential function and primary function is used to approach the actual
concave function, so as to obtain the complete temperature distribution
function in the furnace. The welding parameters are obtained by solving the
ordinary differential equation, and a set of optimal process parameters
consistent with the process boundary are obtained by calculating the mean
square error between the predicted temperature field and the real temperature
distribution. At the same time, a set of reflow optimization strategies are
designed for speed interval prediction strategy, minimum parameter interval
prediction strategy, and the most symmetrical parameter interval prediction of
solder paste melting reflow area. The simulation results show that the
temperature field prediction results obtained by this method are highly
consistent with the actual sensor data, and have strong correlation. This

encompasses traffic phases, which represent the combination of non-conflicting
signal colors of the intersection. Additionally, an action masking mechanism
makes sure that only appropriate phase transitions are carried out. Another
challenge for real-world deployment is to ensure a control behavior that avoids
stress for road users. We demonstrate how to achieve this by incorporating
domain knowledge through extending the action masking mechanism. We test and

retrieval. Unlike traditional retrieval architectures where index and retrieval
are two different and separate components, DSI uses a single transformer model
to perform both indexing and retrieval.
  In this paper, we identify and tackle an important issue of current DSI
models: the data distribution mismatch that occurs between the DSI indexing and
retrieval processes. Specifically, we argue that, at indexing, current DSI
methods learn to build connections between the text of long documents and the
identifier of the documents, but then retrieval of document identifiers is
based on queries that are commonly much shorter than the indexed documents.
This problem is further exacerbated when using DSI for cross-lingual retrieval,
where document text and query text are in different languages.
  To address this fundamental problem of current DSI models, we propose a
simple yet effective indexing framework for DSI, called DSI-QG. When indexing,
DSI-QG represents documents with a number of potentially relevant queries
generated by a query generation model and re-ranked and filtered by a
cross-encoder ranker. The presence of these queries at indexing allows the DSI
models to connect a document identifier to a set of queries, hence mitigating
data distribution mismatches present between the indexing and the retrieval
phases. Empirical results on popular mono-lingual and cross-lingual passage
retrieval datasets show that DSI-QG significantly outperforms the original DSI
model.

the labels and the relationship between visual elements span many frames, e.g.,
identifying a bird flying or catching prey-necessitating concepts with various

CoDEx identifies a rich set of complex concept abstractions from natural

chains of strongly coupled dust grains, the longitudinal modes for
quasicrystalline phase show finite distinction in terms of the instability
regime. The present QLCA based analysis shows system to be stable for
arbitrarily long wavelength of perturbation for full range of screening
parameter $\kappa=a/\lambda_{\rm D}$ beyond the value $\kappa=0.182$, where $a$
is the inter dust separation and $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is the plasma Debye length.
However, this unstable region continuously grows with increase in the dust
temperature which invoke the weak coupling effects. The present results show
that as compared to the one dimensional chains, the more practical 2D and 3D
strongly coupled systems are potentially stable with respect to the macroscopic
amplitude modulations. The development of macroscopic structures from the
mesoscopic fluctuations is therefore predicted to be rather restricted for
strongly coupled systems with implications for systems where strongly coupled
species are in a quasi-localized (semi-solid) phase.

waves propagating on Minkowski space obtained recently in Ref. [1]. We then use
this propagator to study the response of a freely falling Unruh-DeWitt detector
to a gravitational wave background. We find that a freely falling detector
completely cancels the effect of the deformation of the invariant distance
induced by the gravitational waves, such that the only effect comes from an
increased average size of scalar field vacuum fluctuations, the origin of which
can be traced back to the change of the surface in which the gravitational
waves fluctuate. The effect originates from the quantum interference between
propagation on off-shell detector's trajectories which probe different spatial
gravitational potential induced by the gravitational backreaction from
gravitational waves, and it is therefore purely quantum. When resummed over
classical graviton insertions, gravitational waves generate cuts on the
imaginary axis of the complex $\Delta \tau$-plane (where $\Delta \tau =
\tau-\tau'$ denotes the difference of proper times), and the discontinuity
across these cuts is responsible for a continuum of energy transitions induced
in the Unruh-DeWitt detector. Not surprisingly, we find that the detector's
transition rate is exponentially suppressed with increasing energy and the mass
of the scalar field. What is surprising, however, is that the transition rate
is a non-analytic function of the gravitational field strain. This means that,
no matter how small is the gravitational field amplitude, expanding in powers
of the gravitational field strain cannot approximate well the detector's
transition rate.

requires the region-level visual understanding to provide explainable details
of body parts. Most existing approaches address this problem by adding a
regional convolutional neural network (RCNN) with an attribute prediction head
to a two-stage detector, in which attributes of body parts are identified from
local-wise part boxes. However, local-wise part boxes with limit visual clues
(i.e., part appearance only) lead to unsatisfying parsing results, since
attributes of body parts are highly dependent on comprehensive relations among
them. In this article, we propose a Knowledge Embedded RCNN (KE-RCNN) to
identify attributes by leveraging rich knowledges, including implicit knowledge
(e.g., the attribute ``above-the-hip'' for a shirt requires visual/geometry
relations of shirt-hip) and explicit knowledge (e.g., the part of ``shorts''
cannot have the attribute of ``hoodie'' or ``lining''). Specifically, the
KE-RCNN consists of two novel components, i.e., Implicit Knowledge based
Encoder (IK-En) and Explicit Knowledge based Decoder (EK-De). The former is
designed to enhance part-level representation by encoding part-part relational
contexts into part boxes, and the latter one is proposed to decode attributes
with a guidance of prior knowledge about \textit{part-attribute} relations. In
this way, the KE-RCNN is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any
two-stage detectors, e.g., Attribute-RCNN, Cascade-RCNN, HRNet based RCNN and
SwinTransformer based RCNN. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging
benchmarks, e.g., Fashionpedia and Kinetics-TPS, demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalizability of the KE-RCNN. In particular, it achieves higher
improvements over all existing methods, reaching around 3% of AP on
Fashionpedia and around 4% of Acc on Kinetics-TPS.

has been a major source material for the discovery of seminal phenomena in
solid state physics for more than a century. In recent years, spin current
transports in bismuth have also attracted considerable attention. In this
paper, we theoretically study both spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin Nernst
effect (SNE) in bismuth, based on relativistic band structure calculations.
First, we find that there are three independent tensor elements of spin Hall
conductivity (SHC) and spin Nernst conductivity (SNC), namely, $Z_{yx}^z$,
$Z_{xz}^y$, and $Z_{zy}^x$. We calculate all the elements as a function of the
Fermi energy. Second, we find that all SHC tensor elements are large, being
$\sim$1000 ($\hbar$/e)(S/cm) and comparable to that of platinum. Furthermore,
because of its low electrical conductivity, the corresponding spin Hall angles
are gigantic, being $\sim$20%. Third, all the calculated SNC tensor elements
are also pronounced, being comparable to that [$\sim$0.13 ($\hbar$/e)(A/m-K)]
of gold, although they are several times smaller than platinum and $\beta$-Ta.
Finally, in contrast to Pt and Au where $Z_{yx}^z = Z_{xz}^y = Z_{zy}^x$, the
SHE and SNE in bismuth are strongly anisotropic, i.e., $Z_{yx}^z$, $Z_{xz}^y$
and $Z_{zy}^x$ differ significantly. Consequently, the Hall voltages due to the
inverse SHE and SNE from the different conductivity elements could cancel each
other and thus result in a small spin Hall angle if polycrystalline samples are
used, which may explain why the measured spin Hall angles ranging from nearly 0
to 25% have been reported. We hope that these interesting findings would
stimulate further spin current experiments on bismuth using highly oriented
single crystal specimens.

an open question whether a fundamental maximum efficiency exists for
finite-time heat engines with given power. We experimentally implement a
finite-time Carnot cycle with sealed dry air as working substance and verify
the existence of a tradeoff relation between power and efficiency. Efficiency
up to $(0.524\pm0.034)\eta_{\mathrm{C}}$ is reached for the engine to generate
the maximum power, consistent with the theoretical prediction
$\eta_{\mathrm{C}}/2$. Our results shall provide a new platform for studying

  Framework with Annotated Information",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Image transformation, a class of vision and graphics problems whose goal is
to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image, develops
rapidly in the context of deep neural networks. In Computer Vision (CV), many
problems can be regarded as the image transformation task, e.g., semantic
segmentation and style transfer. These works have different topics and
motivations, making the image transformation task flourishing. Some surveys
only review the research on style transfer or image-to-image translation, all
of which are just a branch of image transformation. However, none of the
surveys summarize those works together in a unified framework to our best
knowledge. This paper proposes a novel learning framework including Independent
learning, Guided learning, and Cooperative learning, called the IGC learning
framework. The image transformation we discuss mainly involves the general
image-to-image translation and style transfer about deep neural networks. From
the perspective of this framework, we review those subtasks and give a unified
interpretation of various scenarios. We categorize related subtasks about the
image transformation according to similar development trends. Furthermore,
experiments have been performed to verify the effectiveness of IGC learning.
Finally, new research directions and open problems are discussed for future
research.

identify the interesting moments in untrimmed videos. The key to this task lies
in effective video representations that jointly pursue two goals,
\textit{i.e.}, cross-modal representation learning and fine-grained feature
discrimination. In this paper, these two challenges are tackled by not only
enriching intra-modality and cross-modality relations for representation
modeling but also shaping the features in a discriminative manner. Our proposed
method mainly leverages the intra-modality encoding and cross-modality
co-occurrence encoding for fully representation modeling. Specifically,
intra-modality encoding augments the modality-wise features and dampens
irrelevant modality via within-modality relation learning in both audio and
visual signals. Meanwhile, cross-modality co-occurrence encoding focuses on the
co-occurrence inter-modality relations and selectively captures effective
information among multi-modality. The multi-modal representation is further
enhanced by the global information abstracted from the local context. In
addition, we enlarge the discriminative power of feature embedding with a
hard-pairs guided contrastive learning (HPCL) scheme. A hard-pairs sampling
strategy is further employed to mine the hard samples for improving feature
discrimination in HPCL. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed methods compared
to other state-of-the-art methods.

problems for agents to share information and make good decisions. However, when
deploying trained communicative agents in a real-world application where noise
and potential attackers exist, the safety of communication-based policies
becomes a severe issue that is underexplored. Specifically, if communication
messages are manipulated by malicious attackers, agents relying on
untrustworthy communication may take unsafe actions that lead to catastrophic

by corrupted communication, while still benefiting from benign communication.
In this work, we consider an environment with $N$ agents, where the attacker
may arbitrarily change the communication from any $C<\frac{N-1}{2}$ agents to a
victim agent. For this strong threat model, we propose a certifiable defense by
constructing a message-ensemble policy that aggregates multiple randomly
ablated message sets. Theoretical analysis shows that this message-ensemble
policy can utilize benign communication while being certifiably robust to
adversarial communication, regardless of the attacking algorithm. Experiments
in multiple environments verify that our defense significantly improves the
robustness of trained policies against various types of attacks.

considered. Using the Hirota bilinear method, the general $N$-bright and
$N$-dark soliton solutions are deduced and their Gram determinant forms are
obtained. A special feature of the fundamental bright soliton solution is that,
in general, it behaves like the Korteweg-deVries soliton. However, under a
special condition, it also behaves akin to the nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger
soliton when it loses the amplitude dependent velocity property. The
fundamental dark-soliton solution admits anti-dark, grey, and completely black
soliton profiles, in the short-wave component, depending on the choice of wave
parameters. On the other hand, a bright soliton like profile always occurs in
the long-wave component. The asymptotic analysis shows that both the bright and
dark solitons undergo an elastic collision with a finite phase shift. In
addition to these, by tuning the phase shift regime, we point out the existence
of resonance interactions among the bright solitons. Furthermore, under a
special velocity resonance condition, we bring out the various types of bright

following: (i) When jobs have exponential service times, LRF policies
outperform any other policy. (ii) When service times are New-Worse-than-Used,
MRF-FCFS outperforms LRF-FCFS as the variability of the service time grows

contracts. The HEIDIH model consists of a one-dimensional stochastic advection
equation coupled with a stochastic volatility process, defined as a
Cholesky-type decomposition of the tensor product of a Hilbert-space valued
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the mild solution to the stochastic heat equation
on the real half-line. The advection and heat equations are driven by
independent space-time Gaussian processes which are white in time and colored
in space, with the latter covariance structure expressed by two different
kernels. In the first part of the paper, regularity results for the HEIDIH
model in fractional Sobolev spaces are formulated. These are achieved under
smoothness conditions on the covariance kernels, which in particular allow for
weighted Mat\'ern kernels. In the second part, numerical approximation of the
model is considered. An error decomposition formula, pointwise in space and
time, for a semi-explicit finite-difference scheme is proven. For a special
case, essentially sharp convergence rates are obtained when this is combined
with a fully discrete finite element approximation of the stochastic heat
equation. The analysis takes into account a localization error, a
pointwise-in-space finite element discretization error and an error stemming
from the noise being sampled pointwise in space. The rates obtained in the

such as the uncertainties on the sample redshift distribution $n(z)$. Due to
the challenge of running Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) in the high
dimensional parameter spaces in which the $n(z)$ uncertainties may be
parameterized, it is common practice to simplify the $n(z)$ parameterization or
combine MCMC chains that each have a fixed $n(z)$ resampled from the $n(z)$
uncertainties. In this work, we propose a statistically-principled Bayesian
resampling approach for marginalizing over the $n(z)$ uncertainty using
multiple MCMC chains. We self-consistently compare the new method to existing
ones from the literature in the context of a forecasted cosmic shear analysis

similar cosmological parameter constraints, implying that using the most
computationally efficient of the approaches is appropriate. However, we find
that for datasets with the constraining power of the full HSC survey dataset

the choice of method for marginalizing over $n(z)$ uncertainty among the

uncertainties on cosmological parameters, and a careful model selection is
needed to ensure credible parameter intervals.

comparison with a total of 466 S-type asteroid reflectance spectra. We analyze
(i) if a difference between EOCs and UOCs as well as between H, L and LL can be
seen, (ii) if it is possible to identify unequilibrated and equilibrated S-type

and S-type asteroids all based on reflectance spectra. We checked the
classification of the 31 Antarctic UOCs analyzed in the present work, using
petrography and magnetic measurements, and evidenced that 74% of them were
misclassified. Reflectance spectra were compared between EOCs and UOCs as well
as between H, L and LL chondrites using a set of spectral features including
band depths and positions, peak reflectance values, spectral slopes and the
Ol/(Ol + Px) ratio. UOCs and EOCs reflectance spectra show no clear-cut
dichotomy, but a continuum with some EOCs showing stronger absorption bands and
peak reflectance values, while others are comparable to UOCs. We show by the
example of 6 EOCs that their band depths decrease with decreasing grain size.
Based on reflectance spectra alone, it is thus highly challenging to
objectively identify an unequilibrated from an equilibrated S-type surface.
There is no clear distinction of the chemical groups: only LL EOCs of
petrographic type > 4 can be distinguished from H and L through less deep 2-mic
band depths and 1-mic band positions at longer wavelengths. Lastly, an
anti-correlation between the diameter of the asteroids and their 1000 nm band

lead-lag between time series. Because a closed expression of the distribution
of Transfer Entropy is not known for finite-size samples, statistical testing
is often performed with bootstraps whose slowness prevents the inference of
large lead-lag networks between long time series. On the other hand, the
asymptotic distribution of Transfer Entropy between two time series is known.
In this work, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the test for one time
series having a larger Transfer Entropy than another one on a target time
series. We then measure the convergence speed of both tests in the small sample
size limits via benchmarks. We then introduce Transfer Entropy between
time-shifted time series, which allows to measure the timescale at which
information transfer is maximal and vanishes. We finally apply these methods to
tick-by-tick price changes of several hundreds of stocks, yielding non-trivial

scarcity of data and diverse sound events in real life. This paper presents a
multi-grained based attention network (MGA-Net) for semi-supervised sound event
detection. To obtain the feature representations related to sound events, a
residual hybrid convolution (RH-Conv) block is designed to boost the vanilla
convolution's ability to extract the time-frequency features. Moreover, a
multi-grained attention (MGA) module is designed to learn temporal resolution
features from coarse-level to fine-level. With the MGA module,the network could
capture the characteristics of target events with short- or long-duration,
resulting in more accurately determining the onset and offset of sound events.
Furthermore, to effectively boost the performance of the Mean Teacher (MT)

introduced to increase the diversity of data. Experimental results show that
the MGA-Net outperforms the published state-of-the-art competitors, achieving

medium. It is also a crucial seed species for the building-up of the chemical
complexity in star forming regions. Thus, understanding how its abundance
evolves during the star formation process and whether it enriches the emerging
planetary system is of paramount importance. We used new data from the ALMA
Large Program FAUST (Fifty AU STudy of the chemistry in the disk/envelope
system of Solar-like protostars) to study the methanol line emission towards
the [BHB2007] 11 protobinary system (sources A and B), where a complex
structure of filaments connecting the two sources with a larger circumbinary
disk has been previously detected. Twelve methanol lines have been detected
with upper energies in the range [45-537] K along with one 13CH3OH transition.
The methanol emission is compact and encompasses both protostars, separated by
only 28 au and presents three velocity components, not spatially resolved by
our observations, associated with three different spatial regions, with two of
them close to 11B and the third one associated with 11A. A non-LTE radiative
transfer analysis of the methanol lines concludes that the gas is hot and dense
and highly enriched in methanol with an abundance as high as 1e-5. Using
previous continuum data, we show that dust opacity can potentially completely
absorb the methanol line emission from the two binary objects. Although we
cannot firmly exclude other possibilities, we suggest that the detected hot
methanol is resulting from the shocked gas from the incoming filaments
streaming towards [BHB2007] 11 A and B, respectively. Higher spatial resolution

neutrino mean free path depend on the cut-off only when the chiral potential is
considered at leading order (LO) and next-to leading order (NLO), becoming this
dependence strongly reduced at higher orders in the chiral power counting due
to the role of three-nucleon forces that start to contribute at next-to-next-to
leading order (N$^2$LO) being, in particular, almost negligible at
next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO). The neutrino mean free path is
found to converge up to densities slightly below $\sim 0.15$ fm$^{-3}$ when

being able to automatically identify plant organs and the possible diseases

and its diseases control. To address the problem related to early disease
detection and diagnosis on vines plants, a new dataset has been created with
the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art of diseases recognition via instance
segmentation approaches. This was achieved by gathering images of leaves and
clusters of grapes affected by diseases in their natural context. The dataset
contains photos of 10 object types which include leaves and grapes with and
without symptoms of the eight more common grape diseases, with a total of
17,706 labeled instances in 1,092 images. Multiple statistical measures are
proposed in order to offer a complete view on the characteristics of the
dataset. Preliminary results for the object detection and instance segmentation
tasks reached by the models Mask R-CNN and R^3-CNN are provided as baseline,
demonstrating that the procedure is able to reach promising results about the
objective of automatic diseases' symptoms recognition.

heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of the photoactive layer. This BHJ forms during
the drying of the wet-deposited solution, because of physical processes such as
crystallization and/or liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, the
process-structure relationship remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
a recently developed, coupled phase field fluid mechanics framework is used to
simulate the BHJ formation upon drying. For the first time, this allows to
investigate the interplay between all the relevant physical processes
(evaporation, crystal nucleation and growth, liquid demixing,
composition-dependent kinetic properties), within a single coherent theoretical
framework. Simulations for the model system P3HT-PCBM are presented. The
comparison with previously reported in-situ characterization of the drying
structure is very convincing: the morphology formation pathways,
crystallization kinetics, and final morphology are in line with experimental
results. The final BHJ morphology is a subtle mixture of pure crystalline donor
and acceptor phases, pure and mixed amorphous domains, which depends on the
process parameters and material properties. The expected benefit of such an
approach is to identify physical design rules for ink formulation and
processing conditions to optimize the cell performance. It could be applied to
recent organic material systems in the future.

catch up to masked language modeling. However, unlike words in NLP, the lack of
semantic decomposition of images still makes masked autoencoding (MAE)
different between vision and language. In this paper, we explore a potential
visual analogue of words, i.e., semantic parts, and we integrate semantic
information into the training process of MAE by proposing a Semantic-Guided
Masking strategy. Compared to widely adopted random masking, our masking
strategy can gradually guide the network to learn various information, i.e.,
from intra-part patterns to inter-part relations. In particular, we achieve
this in two steps. 1) Semantic part learning: we design a self-supervised part
learning method to obtain semantic parts by leveraging and refining the
multi-head attention of a ViT-based encoder. 2) Semantic-guided MAE (SemMAE)
training: we design a masking strategy that varies from masking a portion of
patches in each part to masking a portion of (whole) parts in an image.
Extensive experiments on various vision tasks show that SemMAE can learn better
image representation by integrating semantic information. In particular, SemMAE
achieves 84.5% fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1k, which outperforms the
vanilla MAE by 1.4%. In the semantic segmentation and fine-grained recognition
tasks, SemMAE also brings significant improvements and yields the
state-of-the-art performance.

decent level of fairness. The key idea within FEAT is to minimize the ratio
between the best and the worst utilities of the users. This is done by ensuring
that, at each iteration (channel assignment), a user is satisfied with this
assignment as long as he does not loose much more than other users in the
system. It has been shown that FEAT outperforms most related algorithms in many
aspects, especially in interference-limited systems. Indeed, with FEAT we can
ensure a near-optimal, fair and energy efficient solution with low
computational complexity. In terms of robustness, it turns out that the balance
between being nearly globally optimal and good from individual point of view
seems hard to sustain with a significant number of users. Also notice that, in
this regard, global optimality gets less affected than the individual one,
which offers hope that such an accurate water-filling algorithm can be designed
around competition in interference-limited systems.

via CNNs has been studied. Essentially, such methods generate superpixels by
convolutional neural network (CNN) employed on a single image, and such CNNs
are trained without any labels or further information. Thus, such approach
relies on the incorporation of priors, typically by designing an objective
function that guides the solution towards a meaningful superpixel segmentation.
In this paper we propose three key elements to improve the efficacy of such
networks: (i) the similarity of the \emph{soft} superpixelated image compared
to the input image, (ii) the enhancement and consideration of object edges and
boundaries and (iii) a modified architecture based on atrous convolution, which
allow for a wider field of view, functioning as a multi-scale component in our
network. By experimenting with the BSDS500 dataset, we find evidence to the
significance of our proposal, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

cut-off or cloaked below a crossover temperature scale. We elucidate possible
mechanisms that account for the cloaking of the Griffiths phase. Finally, we
construct a phase diagram that encapsulates the various phases of the q-2DEG as
a function of the applied magnetic field and temperature. We further discuss
the various cross-overs and phase transitions in the system by utilizing this

applying HAZOP-like analysis to LESs. While it shows a great potential to
reserve the capability of doing sufficient and systematic safety analysis,
there are new technical challenges raised by the novel characteristics of ML
that require retrofit of the conventional HAZOP technique. In this regard, we
present a new Hierarchical HAZOP-Like method for LESs (HILLS). To deal with the
complexity of LESs, HILLS first does ""divide and conquer"" by stratifying the
whole system into three levels, and then proceeds HAZOP on each level to
identify (latent-)hazards, causes, security threats and mitigation (with new
nodes and guide words). Finally, HILLS attempts at linking and propagating the
causal relationship among those identified elements within and across the three
levels via both qualitative and quantitative methods. We examine and illustrate
the utility of HILLS by a case study on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles, with
discussions on assumptions and extensions to real-world applications. HILLS, as
a first HAZOP-like attempt on LESs that explicitly considers ML internal
behaviours and its interactions with other components, not only uncovers the
inherent difficulties of doing safety analysis for LESs, but also demonstrates
a good potential to tackle them.

skin. It is an ecosystem, composed of several species, competing for resources
and interacting with the skin cells. Imbalance in the cutaneous microbiome,
also called dysbiosis, has been correlated with several skin conditions,
including acne and atopic dermatitis. Generally, dysbiosis is linked to
colonization of the skin by a population of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria
(for example C. acnes in acne or S. aureus in atopic dermatitis). Treatments
consisting in non-specific elimination of cutaneous microflora have shown
conflicting results. It is therefore necessary to understand the factors
influencing shifts of the skin microbiome composition. In this work, we
introduce a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations, with 2
types of bacteria populations (skin commensals and opportunistic pathogens) to
study the mechanisms driving the dominance of one population over the other. By
using published experimental data, assumed to correspond to the observation of
stable states in our model, we derive constraints that allow us to reduce the
number of parameters of the model from 13 to 5. Interestingly, a meta-stable
state settled at around 2 days following the introduction of bacteria in the
model, is followed by a reversed stable state after 300 hours. On the time
scale of the experiments, we show that certain changes of the environment, like
the elevation of skin surface pH, create favorable conditions for the emergence
and colonization of the skin by the opportunistic pathogen population. Such
predictions help identifying potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of
skin conditions involving dysbiosis of the microbiome, and question the
importance of meta-stable states in mathematical models of biological

computational tasks in-silico remains a significant challenge. Surrogate
gradient (SG) techniques have emerged as a standard solution for training SNNs
end-to-end. Still, their success depends on synaptic weight initialization,
similar to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Yet, unlike in the
case of ANNs, it remains elusive what constitutes a good initial state for an
SNN. Here, we develop a general initialization strategy for SNNs inspired by
the fluctuation-driven regime commonly observed in the brain. Specifically, we
derive practical solutions for data-dependent weight initialization that ensure
fluctuation-driven firing in the widely used leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons. We empirically show that SNNs initialized following our strategy
exhibit superior learning performance when trained with SGs. These findings
generalize across several datasets and SNN architectures, including fully
connected, deep convolutional, recurrent, and more biologically plausible SNNs

can be used to certify ellipses with orthogonal axis near each input data of
the neural network. In this work, we remark that ANCER is not invariant under
rotation of input data and propose a new rotationally-invariant formulation of
it which can certify ellipses without constraints on their axis. Our approach
called Riemannian Data Dependant Randomized Smoothing (RDDRS) relies on
information geometry techniques on the manifold of covariance matrices and can
certify bigger regions than ANCER based on our experiments on the MNIST
dataset.

  The classical case arises if $\mu$ is the standard normal distribution,
leading to the noncentral chi-squared distributions. It is well-known that
these may be written as Poisson mixtures of the central chi-squared
distributions with odd degrees of freedom. We obtain such mixture
representations for the logistic distribution and for the hyperbolic secant

forecasts in operational use due to their capability to account for the
uncertainties in the future state of the atmosphere. However, ensemble weather
forecasts are often underdispersive and might also contain bias, which calls
for some form of post-processing. A popular approach to calibration is the
ensemble model output statistics (EMOS) approach resulting in a full predictive
distribution for a given weather variable. However, this form of univariate
post-processing may ignore the prevailing spatial and/or temporal correlation
structures among different dimensions. Since many applications call for
spatially and/or temporally coherent forecasts, multivariate post-processing
aims to capture these possibly lost dependencies. We compare the forecast skill
of different nonparametric multivariate approaches to modeling temporal
dependence of ensemble weather forecasts with different forecast horizons. The
focus is on two-step methods, where after univariate post-processing, the EMOS
predictive distributions corresponding to different forecast horizons are
combined to a multivariate calibrated prediction using an empirical copula.
Based on global ensemble predictions of temperature, wind speed and
precipitation accumulation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
Forecasts from January 2002 to March 2014, we investigate the forecast skill of
different versions of Ensemble Copula Coupling (ECC) and Schaake Shuffle (SSh).
In general, compared with the raw and independently calibrated forecasts,
multivariate post-processing substantially improves the forecast skill. While
even the simplest ECC approach with low computational cost provides a powerful
benchmark method, recently proposed advanced extensions of the ECC and the SSh
are found to not provide any significant improvements over their basic
counterparts.

methods can be significantly inefficient when the predictor matrix is sparse or
numerically sparse. To overcome the limitation, we develop a novel element-wise
subset selection approach, called core-elements, for large-scale least squares

approximately minimizes an upper bound of the estimation variance. We also
provide an approximation guarantee by deriving a coresets-like finite sample
bound for the proposed estimator. To handle potential outliers in the data, we
further combine core-elements with the median-of-means procedure, resulting in
an efficient and robust estimator with theoretical consistency guarantees.
Numerical studies on various synthetic and open-source datasets demonstrate the

branching of semi-classical histories along the Lorentzian evolution. We
posited that there exist at least two histories that contribute to EPI, where
one is an information-losing history while the other is information-preserving.
At early times, the former dominates EPI, while at late times the latter
becomes dominant. By so doing we recovered the essence of the Page curve and
thus the unitarity, albeit with the turning point, i.e., the Page time, much
shifted toward the late time. In this full-length paper, we fill in the details

multi-speaker text-to-speech. With a conventional speaker-adaptation method, a
target speaker's embedding vector is extracted from his/her reference speech
using a speaker encoder trained on a speaker-discriminative task. However, this
method cannot obtain an embedding vector for the target speaker when the
reference speech is unavailable. Our method is based on a human-in-the-loop
optimization framework, which incorporates a user to explore the
speaker-embedding space to find the target speaker's embedding. The proposed
method uses a sequential line search algorithm that repeatedly asks a user to
select a point on a line segment in the embedding space. To efficiently choose
the best speech sample from multiple stimuli, we also developed a system in
which a user can switch between multiple speakers' voices for each phoneme
while looping an utterance. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
method can achieve comparable performance to the conventional one in objective
and subjective evaluations even if reference speech is not used as the input of
a speaker encoder directly.

Bitcoin's whitepaper, its blockchain parameters, and data that were widely up
to his discretion. This ample stack of established and novel evidence is
systematically categorized, analyzed, and then connected to its related,
real-world ambient, like relevant locations and happenings in the past, and at
the time. Evidence compounds towards a substantial role of the Benelux
cryptography ecosystem, with strong transatlantic links, in the creation of
Bitcoin. A consistent biography, a psychogram, and gripping story of an
ingenious, multi-talented, autodidactic, reticent, and capricious polymath
transpire, which are absolutely unique from a history of science and technology
perspective. A cohort of previously fielded and best matches emerging from the

of iron and manganese in Galactic stars. We investigate four different SN Ia
sub-classes, including the classical single-degenerate near-Chandrasekhar mass
(Mch) SN Ia, the fainter SN Iax systems associated with He accretion from the
companion, as well as two sub-Chandrasekhar mass (sub-Mch) SN Ia models. The
latter include the double-detonation of a white dwarf accreting helium-rich
matter and violent white dwarf mergers. Methods. The chemical abundances in
Galactic stars are determined using Gaia eDR3 astrometry and photometry, and
the publicly released spectra obtained within the Gaia-ESO large spectroscopic
survey. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) models are used in the
spectroscopic analysis. The GCE models have been updated to include detailed
delay time distributions arising from binary population synthesis simulations
and the different SN Ia channels, as well as recent yields for core-collapse
supernovae and AGB stars. The data-model comparison is performed using a Markov
chain Monte Carlo framework that allows us to explore the entire parameter
space allowed by the diversity of explosion mechanisms and the Galactic SN Ia
rate, taking into account the uncertainties of the observed data. Results.
Comparison of the new data with GCE models suggests that the observations can
only be explained if the fraction of sub-Mch SNe in the models varies between
50 % and 73 %. The standard Mch SNe are not the dominant channel, but are still
needed to account for the elevated [Mn/Fe] ratio in the thin disc. Our results
only weakly depend on the assumptions on AGB and core collapse SN yields,
providing a strong evidence that sub-Mch SNe play a major role in the chemical
evolution of our Galaxy.

measure the luminosity distance of the GW source with high precision. By
assuming that massive binary black hole mergers and SNe Ia occur in the same

general-purpose pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT2) using the limited
training instances to produce new synthetic data. Consequently, they have
trivial task-specific knowledge and are limited to yielding low-quality
synthetic data. To combat this issue, we propose Knowledge Mixture Data
Augmentation Model (KnowDA) which is an Seq2Seq language model pre-trained on a
mixture of diverse NLP tasks under a novel framework of Knowledge Mixture
Training (KoMT). The goal of KoMT is to condense diverse NLP task-specific
knowledge into the single KnowDA model (i.e., all-in-one) such that KnowDA
could utilize these knowledge to quickly grasp the inherent synthesis law of
the target task through limited training instances. Specifically, KoMT
reformulates input examples from various heterogeneous NLP tasks into a unified
text-to-text format, and employs denoising training objectives in different
granularity to learn to reconstruct partial or complete samples. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first attempt to apply 100+ NLP multi-task training
for data augmentation. Extensive experiments show that i) the synthetic data
produced by KnowDA successfully improves performance of the strong pre-trained
language models (i.e., Bert, ALBert and Deberta) by a large margin on the
low-resource NLP benchmark FewGLUE, CoNLL'03 and WikiAnn; ii) KnowDA
successfully transfers the task knowledge to NLP tasks whose types are seen and

machines, based on cues drawn from their communicative style. Recent work has
suggested that the gulf between people's expectations and the reality of CUI
interaction widens when these impressions are misaligned with the actual
capabilities of conversational user interfaces (CUIs). This has led some to
rally against a perceived overriding concern for naturalness, calling instead
for more representative, or appropriate communicative cues. Indeed, some have
argued for a move away from naturalness as a goal for CUI design and
communication. We contend that naturalness need not be abandoned, if we instead
aim for ecologically grounded design. We also suggest a way this might be
achieved and call on CUI designers to embrace incompetence! By letting CUIs
express uncertainty and embarrassment through ecologically valid and
appropriate cues that are ubiquitous in human communication - CUI designers can
achieve more appropriate communication without turning away from naturalness
entirely.

  and Targeted Plant Parts",,,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Visual reconstruction of tomato plants by a robot is extremely challenging
due to the high levels of variation and occlusion in greenhouse environments.
The paradigm of active-vision helps overcome these challenges by reasoning
about previously acquired information and systematically planning camera
viewpoints to gather novel information about the plant. However, existing
active-vision algorithms cannot perform well on targeted perception objectives,
such as the 3D reconstruction of leaf nodes, because they do not distinguish
between the plant-parts that need to be reconstructed and the rest of the
plant. In this paper, we propose an attention-driven active-vision algorithm
that considers only the relevant plant-parts according to the task-at-hand. The
proposed approach was evaluated in a simulated environment on the task of 3D
reconstruction of tomato plants at varying levels of attention, namely the
whole plant, the main stem and the leaf nodes. Compared to pre-defined and
random approaches, our approach improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction by
9.7% and 5.3% for the whole plant, 14.2% and 7.9% for the main stem, and 25.9%
and 17.3% for the leaf nodes respectively within the first 3 viewpoints. Also,
compared to pre-defined and random approaches, our approach reconstructs 80% of
the whole plant and the main stem in 1 less viewpoint and 80% of the leaf nodes
in 3 less viewpoints. We also demonstrated that the attention-driven NBV
planner works effectively despite changes to the plant models, the amount of
occlusion, the number of candidate viewpoints and the resolutions of
reconstruction. By adding an attention mechanism to active-vision, it is
possible to efficiently reconstruct the whole plant and targeted plant parts.
We conclude that an attention mechanism for active-vision is necessary to
significantly improve the quality of perception in complex agro-food
environments.

It is found that although both models predict close values of the total

numerical simulations reveal that the competition between the substrate
expansion and the increase of the correlation length parallel to the substrate,
$\xi \simeq c t^{1/z}$, gives rise to a number of interesting results. For
instance, when $\gamma < 1/z$ the interface becomes fully correlated, but its
squared roughness, $W_2$, keeps increasing as $W_2 \sim t^{2\alpha \gamma}$, as
previously observed for 1D systems. A careful analysis of this scaling,
accounting for an intrinsic width on it, allows us to estimate the roughness
exponent of the 2D KPZ class as $\alpha = 0.387(1)$, which is very accurate and
robust, once it was obtained averaging the exponents for different models and
growth conditions (i.e., for various $\gamma$'s and $\omega$'s). In this
correlated regime, the height distributions (HDs) and spatial covariances are
consistent with those expected for the steady-state regime of the 2D KPZ class
for flat geometry. For $\gamma \approx 1/z$, we find a family of distributions
and covariances continuously interpolating between those for the steady-state
and the growth regime of radial KPZ interfaces, as the ratio $\omega/c$
augments. When $\gamma>1/z$ the system stays forever in the growth regime and
the HDs always converge to the same asymptotic distribution, which is the one
for the radial case. The spatial covariances, on the other hand, are
$(\gamma,\omega)$-dependent, showing a trend towards the covariance of a random
deposition in enlarging substrates as the expansion rate increases. These
results considerably generalize our understanding of the height fluctuations in
2D KPZ systems, revealing a scenario very similar to the one previously found
in the 1D case.

analog self-interference cancellation (SIC) methods -- i) passive suppression
and ii) regeneration-and-subtraction of SI. For the latter case, the tunable RF
component, such as a multi-tap circuit, reproduces and subtracts the SI. The
resolutions of such RF components constitute the key factor of the analog SIC.
Indeed, they are directly related to how well the SI is imitated. Another major
issue in analog SIC is the inaccurate estimation of the SI channel due to the
nonlinear distortions, which mainly come from the power amplifier (PA). In this
paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the SIC performance of the
multi-tap circuit; we consider how the RF components must overcome such
practical impairments as digitally-controlled attenuators, phase shifters, and
PA. For a realistic performance analysis, we exploit the measured PA
characteristics and carry out a 3D ray-tracing-based, system-level throughput

eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum while increases the small eigenvalues
in the entanglement spectrum, leading to an overall crossover changing pattern
of the entanglement spectrum. Crucially, at low-temperature limit, the thermal
corrections are dominated by the first excited state and depend on its scaling
dimension $\Delta$ and degeneracy $g$. This opens an avenue to extract
universal information of underlying conformal data via the thermal entanglement
spectrum. All of these analytical computation is supported from numerical

convolutional neural networks, we proposed a novel position-prior

between each class center and feature point is captured by self-attention
allowing contextual information re-allocated to strengthen the relative
features and ensure the continuity of segmentation result. The clutsering-based
method is used to estimate class centers, which fosters intra-class consistency
and further improves the accuracy of segmentation results. The position-prior
excludes the false positives from side-output and makes center estimation more
precise. Sufficient experiments are conducted on OAI-ZIB dataset. The
experimental results show that the segmentation performance of combination of

in health, labor, or dating. There exists a rich literature on the formal
modeling of such markets. Typically, these models consist of an arrival
procedure, governing when and which agents enter the market, and a sojourn
period of agents during which they may leave the market matched with another
present agent, or after which they leave the market unmatched. One important
focus lies on the design of mechanisms for the matching process aiming at
maximizing the quality of the produced matchings or at minimizing waiting
costs.
  We study a dynamic matching procedure where homogeneous agents arrive at
random according to a Poisson process and form edges at random yielding a
sparse market. Agents leave according to a certain departure distribution and
may leave early by forming a pair with a compatible agent. The objective is to
maximize the number of matched agents. Our main result is to show that a mild
guarantee on the maximum sojourn time of agents suffices to get almost optimal
performance of instantaneous matching, despite operating in a thin market. This
has the additional advantages of avoiding the risk of market congestion and
guaranteeing short waiting times. We develop new techniques for proving our

randomized sketching or sampling methods to produce smaller representations of

observed to exhibit many robust performance characteristics that are known to
occur when a data sample comes from a sub-gaussian random design, which is a
powerful statistical model of data distributions. However, this phenomenon has
only been studied for specific tasks and metrics, or by relying on
computationally expensive methods. We address this by providing an algorithmic
framework for gaussianizing data distributions via averaging, proving that it
is possible to efficiently construct data sketches that are nearly
indistinguishable (in terms of total variation distance) from sub-gaussian
random designs. In particular, relying on a recently introduced sketching
technique called Leverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, we show that one
can construct an $n\times d$ sketch of an $N\times d$ matrix $A$, where $n\ll
N$, that is nearly indistinguishable from a sub-gaussian design, in time
$O(\text{nnz}(A)\log N + nd^2)$, where $\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of
non-zero entries in $A$. As a consequence, strong statistical guarantees and
precise asymptotics available for the estimators produced from sub-gaussian
designs (e.g., for least squares and Lasso regression, covariance estimation,
low-rank approximation, etc.) can be straightforwardly adapted to our sketching
framework. We illustrate this with a new approximation guarantee for sketched
least squares, among other examples.

use a cascade of two neural networks, where one performs a rough segmentation
based on the U-Net architecture and the other performs the final segmentation
on polar image transformations of the input. Connected component analysis of
the rough segmentation is used to construct the polar transformations, and
predictions on multiple transformations of the same image are fused using
hysteresis thresholding. We show that this method improves aorta segmentation
performance without requiring complex neural network architectures. In
addition, we show that our approach improves robustness and pixel-level recall
while achieving segmentation performance in line with the state of the art.

electron and hole wavefunction overlap due to high piezoelectric field.
Staggered InGaN quantum wells (QWs) have been proposed to increase the
wavefunction overlap and improve the efficiency of LEDs especially for long
wavelength emitters. In this work we evidence that the growth of staggered QWs
has also another beneficial effect as it allows to reduce the formation of
defects, responsible for nonradiative Shockley-Read-Hall recombination, at the
bottom interface of the QW. Staggered QWs comprised an InGaN layer of an
intermediate In content between the barrier and the QW. We show that insertion
of such a layer results in a significant increase of the luminescence
intensity, even if the calculated wavefunction overlap drops. We study the
dependence of the thickness of such an intermediate In content layer on
photoluminescence (PL) intensity behavior. Staggered QWs exhibit increased
cathodoluminescence (CL) homogeneity that is a fingerprint of lower density of
defects, in contrast to standard QWs for which high density of dark spots are
observed in QW emission mapping. Transmission electron microscopy of standard
QWs revealed formation of basal-plane stacking faults (BSFs) and voids that
could have resulted from vacancy aggregation. Stepwise increase of the In
content in staggered QWs prevents formation of point defects and results in an
increased luminescence efficiency. The In composition difference between the
barrier and the well is therefore a key parameter to control the formation of
point defects in the high-In content QWs, influencing the luminescence
efficiency.

Averaging the energy and angular momentum losses during crossings allows us to

research comes from the fact that, in the presence of resonances between
frequencies of the harmonic oscillator and for a generic bounded perturbation,
the set of semiclassical measures for quasimodes of sufficiently small width is
strictly smaller than the corresponding set of semiclassical measures for the
unperturbed system. In this work we precise the description of this set taking
into account the Diophantine properties of the vector of frequencies, the
separation between clusters of eigenvalues in the spectrum produced by the
presence of a perturbation, and the dynamical properties of the classical
Hamiltonian flow generated by the average of the symbol of the perturbation by
the harmonic oscillator flow. In particular, for the perturbed two-dimensional
periodic harmonic oscillator, we characterize the set of semiclassical measures
of quasimodes with a width that is critical for this problem. Two of the main
ingredients in the proof of these results, which are of independent interest,

  Our AMLMC algorithm is built on the results of the weak convergence rates in
the work [Moon et al., BIT Numer. Math., 46 (2006), 367-407] for an adaptive
algorithm using isoparametric d-linear quadrilateral finite element
approximations and the dual weighted residual error representation in a
deterministic setting. Designed to suit the geometric nature of the
singularities in the solution, our AMLMC algorithm uses a sequence of
deterministic, non-uniform auxiliary meshes as a building block. The
deterministic adaptive algorithm generates these meshes, corresponding to a
geometrically decreasing sequence of tolerances. For a given realization of the
diffusivity coefficient and accuracy level, AMLMC constructs its approximate
sample using the first mesh in the hierarchy that satisfies the corresponding
bias accuracy constraint.
  This adaptive approach is particularly useful for the lognormal case treated
here, which lacks uniform coercivity and thus produces functional outputs that
vary over orders of magnitude when sampled.
  We discuss iterative solvers and compare their efficiency with direct ones.
To reduce computational work, we propose a stopping criterion for the iterative
solver with respect to the quantity of interest, the realization of the
diffusivity coefficient, and the desired level of AMLMC approximation.
  From the numerical experiments, based on a Fourier expansion of the
coefficient field, we observe improvements in efficiency compared with both
standard Monte Carlo and standard MLMC for a problem with a singularity similar
to that at the tip of a slit modeling a crack.

soils, oceans or the human gut-track microbiome. In these natural environments,
carrier fluids such as mucus or reproductive fluids show complex structure
associated with non-Newtonian rheology. Many fundamental questions concerning
the the ability to navigate in such environments remain unsolved due to the
inherent complexity of the natural surroundings. Recently, the interaction of
swimming bacteria with nematic liquid crystals has attracted lot of attention.
In these structured fluids, the kinetics of bacterial motion is constrained by
the orientational molecular order of the liquid crystal (or director field) and
novel spatio-temporal patterns arise from this orientational constraint, as
well as from the interactions with topological defects. A question unaddressed
so far is how bacteria are able to change swimming direction in such an
environment. In this work, we study the swimming mechanism of a single
bacterium, E. coli, constrained to move along the director field of a lyotropic
chromonic liquid crystal (LCLC) that is confined to a planar cell. In such an
environment, the spontaneous run and tumble motion of the bacterium gets
frustrated: the elasticity of the liquid crystal prevents flagella from
unbundling. Interestingly, in order to change direction, bacteria execute a
reversal motion along the director field, driven by the relocation of a single
flagellum to the other side of the bacterial body, coined as a frustrated
tumble. We present a detailed experimental characterization of this phenomenon,
exploiting exceptional spatial and temporal resolution of bacteria and flagella
dynamics during swimming, obtained using a two color Lagrangian tracking
technique. We suggest a possible mechanism behind the frustrated run and tumble
motion, accounting for these observations.

of the water tanks will be moved to Korea at a distance of 1100 km. The flux at
295 km will cover the first oscillation maximum and the flux at 1100 km will
mainly cover the second oscillation maximum. As physics sensitivity at the dual
baseline rely on variation in statistics, dependence of systematic uncertainty,
effect of second oscillation maximum and matter density, 187 kt detector volume
at 295 km and 187 kt detector volume at 1100 km may not be the optimal
configuration of T2HKK. Therefore, we have tried to optimize the ratio of the
detector volume at both the locations by studying the interplay between the
above mentioned parameters. For the analysis of neutrino mass hierarchy, octant
of $\theta_{23}$ and CP precision, we have considered two values of
$\delta_{\rm{CP}}$ as 270$^\circ$ and $0^\circ$ and for CP violation we have
considered the value of $\delta_{\rm CP}= 270^\circ$. These values are
motivated by the current best-fit values of this parameter as obtained from the
experiments T2K and NO$\nu$A. Interestingly we find that if the systematic
uncertainty is negligible then the T2HK setup i.e., when both the detector
tanks are placed at 295 km gives the best results in terms of hierarchy
sensitivity at $\delta_{\rm CP}= 270^\circ$, octant sensitivity, CP violation
sensitivity and CP precision sensitivity at $\delta_{\rm CP}= 0^\circ$. For
current values of systematic errors, we find that neither T2HK, nor T2HKK setup
is giving better results for hierarchy, CP violation and CP precision
sensitivity. The optimal detector volume which is of the range between 255 kt
to 345 kt at 1100 km gives better results in those above mentioned parameters.

  Graphs $G$ and $H$ are *homomorphism indistinguishable* over a family
$\mathcal{F}$ if $\hom(F,G) = \hom(F,H)$ for all $F \in \mathcal{F}$, where
$\hom(F,G)$ is the number of homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$. A classical result
of Lov\'{a}sz says that isomorphism is equivalent to homomorphism
indistinguishability over the class of all graphs. In recent years it has been
shown that many homomorphism indistinguishability relations have natural
algebraic and/or logical formulations. Currently, much research in this area is
focused on finding such reformulations. We aim to broaden the scope of current
research on homomorphism indistinguishability by introducing new
concepts/constructions and proposing several conjectures/questions. In
particular, we conjecture that every family closed under disjoint unions and
minors gives rise to a distinct homomorphism indistinguishability relation.
  We also show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of graphs closed under
disjoint unions, restrictions to connected components, and weak oddomorphisms,
then $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies a certain maximality or closure property:
homomorphism indistinguishability over $\mathcal{F}$ of $G$ and $H$ does not
imply $\hom(F,G) = \hom(F,H)$ for any $F \notin \mathcal{F}$. This allows us to
answer a question raised over ten years ago, showing that homomorphism

to HTE estimation in both randomized trials and observational studies. In
particular ""causal forests"", introduced by Athey, Tibshirani and Wager (2019),
along with the R implementation in package grf were rapidly adopted. A related
approach, called ""model-based forests"", that is geared towards randomized
trials and simultaneously captures effects of both prognostic and predictive
variables, was introduced by Seibold, Zeileis and Hothorn (2018) along with a
modular implementation in the R package model4you.
  Here, we present a unifying view that goes beyond the theoretical motivations
and investigates which computational elements make causal forests so successful
and how these can be blended with the strengths of model-based forests. To do
so, we show that both methods can be understood in terms of the same parameters
and model assumptions for an additive model under L2 loss. This theoretical
insight allows us to implement several flavors of ""model-based causal forests""
and dissect their different elements in silico.
  The original causal forests and model-based forests are compared with the new
blended versions in a benchmark study exploring both randomized trials and
observational settings. In the randomized setting, both approaches performed
akin. If confounding was present in the data generating process, we found local
centering of the treatment indicator with the corresponding propensities to be
the main driver for good performance. Local centering of the outcome was less
important, and might be replaced or enhanced by simultaneous split selection
with respect to both prognostic and predictive effects.

However, most methods neglect the fact that the overwhelming negative instances
exist in each image during the training phase, which would mislead the training

progressive instance-balanced sampling (OPIS) algorithm based on hard sampling
and soft sampling is proposed in this paper. The algorithm includes two
modules: a progressive instance balance (PIB) module and a progressive instance
reweighting (PIR) module. The PIB module combining random sampling and
IoU-balanced sampling progressively mines hard negative instances while
balancing positive instances and negative instances. The PIR module further
utilizes classifier scores and IoUs of adjacent refinements to reweight the
weights of positive instances for making the network focus on positive
instances. Extensive experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012
datasets demonstrate the proposed method can significantly improve the
baseline, which is also comparable to many existing state-of-the-art results.
In addition, compared to the baseline, the proposed method requires no extra

could be easily integrated into other methods based on the instance classifier

adimensional ratios of their first central moments ($m_n$) or cumulants
($\kappa_n$), especially the skewness $S$ and kurtosis $K$, whose accurate
estimate demands an averaging over all $L^d$ points of the height profile at a
given time, in translation-invariant interfaces, and over $N$ independent
samples. One way of doing this is by calculating $m_n(t)$ [or $\kappa_n(t)$]
for each sample and then carrying out an average of them for the $N$
interfaces, with $S$ and $K$ being calculated only at the end. Another approach
consists in directly calculating the ratios for each interface and, then,
averaging the $N$ values. It turns out, however, that $S$ and $K$ for the
growth regime HDs display strong finite-size and -time effects when estimated
from these ""interface statistics"", as already observed in some previous works
and clearly shown here, through extensive simulations of several discrete
growth models belonging to the EW and KPZ classes on 1D and 2D substrates of
sizes $L=const.$ and $L \sim t$. Importantly, I demonstrate that with ""1-point
statistics'', i.e., by calculating $m_n(t)$ [or $\kappa_n(t)$] once for all $N
L^d$ heights together, these corrections become very weak. However, I find that
this ""1-point'' approach fails in uncovering the universality of the HDs in the
steady state regime (SSR) of systems whose average height, $\bar{h}$, is a
fluctuating variable. In fact, as demonstrated here, in this regime the 1-pt
height evolves as $h(t) = \bar{h}(t) + s_{\lambda} A^{1/2} L^{\alpha} \zeta +
\cdots$ -- where $P(\zeta)$ is the underlying SSR HD -- and the fluctuations in
$\bar{h}$ yield $S_{1pt} \sim t^{-1/2}$ and $K_{1pt} \sim t^{-1}$. Nonetheless,
by analyzing $P(h-\bar{h})$, the cumulants of $P(\zeta)$ can be accurately
determined.

one with chirping, we find that the strength of interference effect of the
momentum spectrum and the reduced particle number are all changeable
periodically with phase, in particular, these periodical changes are more
sensitive to the applied parameters in case of low frequency field. At the
small spatial scale, the reduced particle number change is over one order
magnitude by phase in small chirping. For the reduced particle number, the
different optimal phases are obtained at different spatial scales, however, the
larger the chirping is applied, the higher the created pair number is got.
Interestingly, some different types of symmetries, i.e., the mutual symmetry of
mirror/coincidence for two correlated phases and the individual self symmetry
for single phase, are unfolded on the momentum spectrum. The physical reason of
the mutual symmetry between two correlated phases and also the individual
symmetry for two fixed specific phases are examined and discussed analytically
in detail. The combined roles by phase and chirping on the periodic and
symmetrical behaviors of the momentum spectrum and the reduced particle number
are expected to have the potential extension to more fields such as that with

emit photons and photons decay into electron-positron pairs. This decay of the
particle states leads to an exponential damping term in the probabilities of
single nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair
production. In this paper we investigate analytically and numerically the
probabilities of nonlinear Compton scattering and nonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair
production including the particle states' decay. For this we first compute
spin- and polarization-resolved expressions of the probabilities, provide some
of their asymptotic behaviors and show that the results of the total
probabilities are independent of the spin and polarization bases. Then, we
present several plots of the total and differential probabilities for different
pulse lengths and for different spin and polarization quantum numbers. We
observe that it is crucial to take into account the damping of the states in
order for the probabilities to stay always below unity and we show that the
damping factors also scale with the intensity and pulse duration of the
background field. In the case of nonlinear Compton scattering we show
numerically that the total probability behaves like a Poissonian distribution
in the regime where the photon recoil is negligible. In all considered cases,
the kinematic conditions are such that the final particles momenta transverse
to the propagation direction of the plane wave are always much smaller than the
particles longitudinal momenta and the main spread of the momentum distribution
on the transverse plane is along the direction of the plane-wave electric
field.

topics in environmental sound analysis. Considering that acoustic scenes and
sound events are closely related to each other, the joint analysis of acoustic
scenes and sound events using multitask learning (MTL)-based neural networks
was proposed in some previous works. Conventional methods train MTL-based
models using a linear combination of ASC and SED loss functions with constant
weights. However, the performance of conventional MTL-based methods depends
strongly on the weights of the ASC and SED losses, and it is difficult to
determine the appropriate balance between the constant weights of the losses of
MTL of ASC and SED. In this paper, we thus propose dynamic weight adaptation
methods for MTL of ASC and SED based on dynamic weight average and multi--focal
loss to adjust the learning weights automatically. Evaluation experiments using
parts of the TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016/2017 and TUT Sound Events 2016/2017 are
conducted, and we show that the proposed methods improve the scene
classification and event detection performance characteristics compared with
the conventional MTL-based method. We then investigate how the learning weights
of ASC and SED tasks dynamically adapt as the model training progresses.

parameters related to redundancy and dead-ends. Then we analyze its stability
against cascading failures by varying these two parameters using the link
failure model. This helps to gain insight into the relation of network topology

Cryptographic Operations (COs) takeplace in the side-channel signal. In
laboratory conditions with full control over the Device under Test (DuT),
dedicated trigger signals can be implemented to indicate the start and end of
COs. For real-world scenarios, waveform-matching techniques have been
established which compare the side-channel signal with a template of the CO's
pattern in real time to detect the CO in the side channel. State-of-the-art
approaches are implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However,
current waveform-matching designs are processing the samples from
Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) sequentially and can only work with low
sampling rates due to the limited clock speed of FPGAs. This makes it
increasingly difficult to apply existing techniques on modern DuTs that are
operating with clock speeds in the GHz range. In this paper, we present a
parallel waveform-matching architecture that is capable of performing waveform
matching at the speed of fast ADCs. We implement the proposed architecture in a
high-end FPGA-based digitizer and apply it to detect AES COs from the side
channel of a single-board computer operating at 1 GHz. Our implementation
allows for waveform matching at 10 GS/s with high accuracy, thus offering a
speedup of 50x compared to the fastest state-of-the-art implementation known to
us.

showing that the reduced mean-field description we derived can qualitatively

apply this technique to develop an ER for networks of neurons with bursting

practical HDR capturing, processing, and display solutions to bring 3D
technologies to the next level. Depth estimation of multi-exposure stereo image
sequences is an essential task in the development of cost-effective 3D HDR
video content. In this paper, we develop a novel deep architecture for
multi-exposure stereo depth estimation. The proposed architecture has two novel
components. First, the stereo matching technique used in traditional stereo
depth estimation is revamped. For the stereo depth estimation component of our
architecture, a mono-to-stereo transfer learning approach is deployed. The
proposed formulation circumvents the cost volume construction requirement,
which is replaced by a ResNet based dual-encoder single-decoder CNN with
different weights for feature fusion. EfficientNet based blocks are used to
learn the disparity. Secondly, we combine disparity maps obtained from the
stereo images at different exposure levels using a robust disparity feature
fusion approach. The disparity maps obtained at different exposures are merged
using weight maps calculated for different quality measures. The final
predicted disparity map obtained is more robust and retains best features that
preserve the depth discontinuities. The proposed CNN offers flexibility to
train using standard dynamic range stereo data or with multi-exposure low
dynamic range stereo sequences. In terms of performance, the proposed model
surpasses state-of-the-art monocular and stereo depth estimation methods, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, on challenging Scene flow and differently
exposed Middlebury stereo datasets. The architecture performs exceedingly well
on complex natural scenes, demonstrating its usefulness for diverse 3D HDR
applications.

The energy consumption of such devices is important both due to the total
number of devices deployed and because such devices are often battery-powered.
Hence, improving the energy efficiency of such high-performance embedded
systems is crucial. The first step to decreasing energy consumption is to
accurately measure it, as we base our conclusions and decisions on the
measurements. Given the importance of the measurements, it surprised us that
most publications dedicate little space and effort to the description of their
experimental setup.
  One variable of importance of the measurement system is the sampling
frequency, e.g. how often the continuous signal's voltage and current are
measured per second. In this paper, we systematically explore the impact of the
sampling frequency on the accuracy of the measurement system. We measure the
energy consumption of a Hardkernel Odroid-XU4 board executing nine Rodinia
benchmarks with a wide range of runtimes and options at 4kHz, which is the
standard sampling frequency of our measurement system. We show that one needs
to measure at least at 350Hz to achieve equivalent results in comparison to the
original power traces. Sampling at 1Hz (e.g. Hardkernel SmartPower2) results in
a maximum error of 80%.

construct a compact data structure that supports the following query: given an
integer $w$ return the number of length-$w$ substrings of $S$ that contain each
character of $Q$ at least once. This is a natural string problem with
applications to, e.g., data mining, natural language processing, and DNA
analysis. The state of the art is an $O(\sqrt{nq})$ space data structure that
-- with some minor additions -- supports queries in $O(\log\log n)$ time [CPM
2021].
  Our contributions are as follows. Firstly, we analyze the problem in terms of
a new, natural parameter $d$, giving a simple data structure that uses $O(d)$
space and supports queries in $O(\log\log n)$ time. The preprocessing algorithm
does a single pass over $S$, runs in expected $O(n)$ time, and uses $O(d)$
space in addition to the input. Furthermore, we show that $O(d)$ space is
optimal and that $O(\log\log n)$-time queries are optimal given optimal space.
Secondly, we bound $d = O(\sqrt{nq})$, giving clean bounds in terms of $n$ and
$q$ that match the state of the art. Furthermore, we prove that
$\Omega(\sqrt{nq})$ bits of space is necessary in the worst case, meaning that
the $O(\sqrt{nq})$ upper bound is tight to within polylogarithmic factors. All
of our results are based on simple and intuitive combinatorial ideas that
simplify the state of the art.

direct investigation at interfaces. To overcome this difficulty, here we employ
neutron reflectometry, which allows us to probe the structure and
responsiveness of the microgels in-situ at the air-water interface. We
investigate two types of microgels with different cross-link density, thus
having different softness and deformability, both below and above their volume
phase transition temperature, combining experiments with computer simulations
of realistic in silico synthesized microgels. We find that temperature only
affects the portion of microgels in water, while the strongest effect of the
microgels softness is observed in their ability to protrude into the air. In
particular, standard microgels have an apparent contact angle of few degrees,
while ultra-low cross-linked microgels form a flat polymeric layer with zero
contact angle. Altogether, this study provides an in-depth microscopic
description of how different microgel architectures affect their arrangements
at interfaces, and will be the foundation for a better understanding of their

exhibited hydrogen Balmer series and helium emission lines, and a flat overall

key parameters modeled by a neural network and adapt to different flight
scenarios. We achieve this by deriving the analytical gradients of the MHE
estimates with respect to the weighting matrices, which enables a seamless
embedding of the MHE as a learnable layer into neural networks for highly
effective learning. Interestingly, we show that the gradients can be computed
efficiently using a Kalman filter in a recursive form. Moreover, we develop a
model-based policy gradient algorithm to train NeuroMHE directly from the
quadrotor trajectory tracking error without needing the ground-truth
disturbance data. The effectiveness of NeuroMHE is verified extensively via
both simulations and physical experiments on quadrotors in various challenging
flights. Notably, NeuroMHE outperforms the state-of-the-art neural
network-based estimator with estimation error reductions of up to about 49.4%
by using only a 2.5% amount of the neural network parameters. The proposed
method is general and can be applied to robust adaptive control of other
robotic systems.

six new dusty galaxies at 3.5<z<4.2 by solidly detecting [CI](1-0) and CO
transitions. The sample was selected from the COSMOS and GOODS-North
super-deblended catalogs with FIR photometric redshifts z>6, based on template
IR spectrum energy distribution (SED) from known submillimeter galaxies at
z=4--6. Dust SED analyses explain the photo-z overestimate from seemingly cold
dust temperatures (Td) and steep Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes, providing
additional examples of cold dusty galaxies impacted by the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). We therefore study the general properties of the enlarged
sample of 10 ``cold"" dusty galaxies over 3.5<z<6. We conclude that these
galaxies are deceivingly cold at the surface but actually warm in their
starbursting cores. Several lines of evidence support this scenario: (1) The
high infrared surface density and cold Td from optically thin models appear to
violate the Stefan-Boltzmann law; (2) the gas masses derived from optically
thin dust masses are inconsistent with estimates from dynamics and CI
luminosities; (3) the implied high star formation efficiencies would conflict
with cold Td; (4) high FIR optical depth is implied even using the lower,
optically-thick dust masses. This work confirms the existence of a substantial
population of deceivingly cold, compact dusty starburst galaxies at z>~4,
together with the severe impact of the CMB on their RJ observables, paving the
way for the diagnostics of optically thick dust in the early universe.
Conventional gas mass estimates based on RJ dust continuum luminosities
implicitly assume an optically thin case, overestimating gas masses by a factor
of 2--3 on average in compact dusty star-forming galaxies.

the heart of our analysis is the smoothness property of the fixed points in

existing $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ complexity for two coupled sequences.
When all but the main sequence have strongly monotone increments, we establish
the iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. The merit of our
results lies in that applying them to stochastic bilevel and compositional
optimization problems, as well as RL problems leads to either relaxed

non-deterministic phenomena: impulsive glitches and timing noise. Both
phenomena are interesting per se, and may provide insights into the superfluid
properties of neutron stars, but they also act as a barrier to high-precision
pulsar timing and gravitational wave experiments. We study a minimal stochastic
model to describe the spin-down of a multicomponent neutron star, with
fluctuations in both the internal and external torques. The power spectral
density and timing noise strength of this kind of model can be obtained
analytically, and compared with known results from pulsar timing observational
campaigns. In particular, the presence of flat regions of the power spectral
density can be interpreted as a signature of the presence of internal
superfluid components. We also derive the expected scaling of the timing noise
strength with the pulsar's rotational parameters (or characteristic age).
Therefore, the present framework offers a theoretical guideline to interpret
the observed features of timing noise in both single pulsars and across pulsar
population.

Wheeler's layman's analogy of the Quantum foam. To understand the
distributional aspects of this model is the guaranteed existence of a sequence
of compactly supported shift vectors that converge to the fundamental solution
used to introduce a sequence of 3+1 globally hyperbolic spacetimes. Using the
sequence of these causally stable spacetimes it is shown that there exists a
positive integer such that for all elements in the sequence with a greater
index value than this integer and for any Eulerian observer will the shift
vector increase more rapidly than any polynomial and the volume expansion is
more rapid than a polynomial in all directions. The same conclusion remains
valid for the trace of the extrinsic curvature. Nonetheless, it is shown, no
matter how volatile the extrinsic curvature is for these elements there also
exists elements in the other end of the sequence where the extrinsic curvature
is negligible and the spacetime flat.

online web apps (e.g., Google Map and Uber) estimate the travel time of
trajectory data collected by mobile devices. However, in reality, complex
factors, such as network communication and energy constraints, make multiple
trajectories collected at a low sampling rate. In this case, this paper aims to
resolve the problem of travel time estimation (TTE) and route recovery in
sparse scenarios, which often leads to the uncertain label of travel time and
route between continuously sampled GPS points. We formulate this problem as an
inexact supervision problem in which the training data has coarsely grained
labels and jointly solve the tasks of TTE and route recovery. And we argue that
both two tasks are complementary to each other in the model-learning procedure
and hold such a relation: more precise travel time can lead to better inference
for routes, in turn, resulting in a more accurate time estimation). Based on
this assumption, we propose an EM algorithm to alternatively estimate the
travel time of inferred route through weak supervision in E step and retrieve
the route based on estimated travel time in M step for sparse trajectories. We
conducted experiments on three real-world trajectory datasets and demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

entanglement between disconnected regions computable by switching on a replica
parameter $q$ modeled by the quotient dS$/\mathbb{Z}_q$. Within this framework,
we show that the centrally-extended asymptotic symmetry algebra near the cosmic
horizon is a single copy of the Virasoro algebra. The resulting density of
states matches the semi-classical result of Gibbons and Hawking up to an
undetermined constant that is chosen to reproduce the entanglement entropy
previously found in the literature. It follows that the logarithmic quantum
corrections to the Cardy entropy reproduces the known one-loop result computed
in the bulk in the presence of a cutoff. The resulting entanglement entropy
follows the divergent area law, where the UV cutoff is now a function of the
replica parameter. Thus, as the near-horizon CFT fixes the cutoff in units of
the Planck scale, the model can be viewed as a probe into whether the defect
Hilbert space has a finite dimension; indeed, the limit $q\to 0$, reproduces
Banks' formula. We also study the quantum corrections of the effective
description of the horizon entropy by means of Liouville field theory, where
the large $q$ limit corresponds to a realization of dS$_3$/CFT$_2$
correspondence matching the logarithmic corrections to three-dimensional de
Sitter space obtained by computing the one-loop contribution to the quantum

First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm can be stochastically
improved upon by a scheduling algorithm called {\it Nudge} for light-tailed job
size distributions. Nudge partitions jobs into 4 types based on their size, say
small, medium, large and huge jobs. Nudge operates identical to FCFS, except
that whenever a {\it small} job arrives that finds a {\it large} job waiting at
the back of the queue, Nudge swaps the small job with the large one unless the
large job was already involved in an earlier swap.
  In this paper, we show that FCFS can be stochastically improved upon under
far weaker conditions. We consider a system with $2$ job types and limited
swapping between type-$1$ and type-$2$ jobs, but where a type-$1$ job is not
necessarily smaller than a type-$2$ job. More specifically, we introduce and
study the Nudge-$K$ scheduling algorithm which allows type-$1$ jobs to be
swapped with up to $K$ type-$2$ jobs waiting at the back of the queue, while
type-$2$ jobs can be involved in at most one swap. We present an explicit
expression for the response time distribution under Nudge-$K$ when both job
types follow a phase-type distribution. Regarding the asymptotic tail
improvement ratio (ATIR) , we derive a simple expression for the ATIR, as well
as for the $K$ that maximizes the ATIR. We show that the ATIR is positive and
the optimal $K$ tends to infinity in heavy traffic as long as the type-$2$ jobs
are on average longer than the type-$1$ jobs.

desirable to have a precise and concise title, which is beneficial for both

enables LKD as if it were performed on the join of the actual raw tables? Q2:
What are appropriate models to use per table? Q3: As the model join would be an
approximation of the actual data join, how can one evaluate the quality of the
model join result? This work puts forth a framework, Model Join, addressing
these challenges. The framework integrates and joins the per-table models of
the absent tables and generates a uniform and independent sample that is a
high-quality approximation of a uniform and independent sample of the actual
raw-data join. The approximation stems from the models, but not from the Model
Join framework. The sample obtained by the Model Join can be used to perform
LKD downstream tasks, such as approximate query processing, classification,
clustering, regression, association rule mining, visualization, and so on. To
our knowledge, this is the first work with this agenda and solutions. Detailed
experiments with TPC-DS data and synthetic data showcase Model Join's
usefulness.

Run-Length Encoding (RLE) based join-result summary, entailing all statistics
necessary to materialize the join result. Second, and most importantly, to show
that a join algorithm, like GJ, which produces the above join-result summary
and then desummarizes it, can introduce large performance benefits in time and

JOB, TPCDS, and lastFM datasets, comparing GJ against PostgresQL and MonetDB
and a state of the art WOJA implemented within the Umbra system. The results
for in-memory join computation show performance improvements up to 64X, 388X,

element atom is a very selective process. Reactions with ground-state neutral
carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms are very endoergic and have high
energy barriers because the H2 molecule has to be fragmented before a hydride
bond is formed. In cold interstellar clouds, these barriers exclude the
formation of CH, OH, NH, and SH radicals through hydrogen abstraction
reactions. Here we study a very energetically unfavorable process, the reaction
of N(4S) atoms with H2 molecules. We calculated the reaction rate coefficient
for H2 in different vibrational levels, using quantum methods for v=0-7 and
quasi-classical methods up to v=12. Owing to the high energy barrier, these
rate coefficients increase with v and also with the gas temperature. We
implemented the new rates in the Meudon PDR code and studied their effect on
models with different ultraviolet (UV) illumination conditions. In strongly
UV-irradiated dense gas (Orion Bar conditions), the presence of H2 in highly
vibrationally excited levels (v>7) enhances the NH abundance by two orders of
magnitude (at the PDR surface) compared to models that use the thermal rate
coefficient for reaction N(4S) + H2 -> NH + H. The increase in NH column
density across the PDR is a factor of ~25. We explore existing Herschel/HIFI
observations of the Orion Bar and Horsehead PDRs. We report a 3-sigma emission
feature at the ~974 GHz frequency of the NH N_J=1_2-0_1 line toward the Bar.
The emission level implies N(NH)~10^13 cm^-2, which is consistent with PDR
models using the new rate coefficients for reactions between N and UV-pumped
H2. This formation route dominates over hydrogenation reactions involving the
less abundant N+ ion. JWST observations will soon quantify the amount and
reactivity of UV-pumped H2 in many interstellar and circumstellar environments.

several approaches to approximate the true distribution of negative pairs.

effective instruments to alleviate this issue. Among the most studied
compression techniques is the class of unbiased compression operators with
variance bounded by a multiple of the square norm of the vector we wish to
compress. By design, this variance may remain high, and only diminishes if the
input vector approaches zero. However, unless the model being trained is
overparameterized, there is no a-priori reason for the vectors we wish to
compress to approach zero during the iterations of classical methods such as
distributed compressed {\sf SGD}, which has adverse effects on the convergence
speed. Due to this issue, several more elaborate and seemingly very different
algorithms have been proposed recently, with the goal of circumventing this
issue. These methods are based on the idea of compressing the {\em difference}
between the vector we would normally wish to compress and some auxiliary vector
which changes throughout the iterative process. In this work we take a step
back, and develop a unified framework for studying such methods, conceptually,

gradients and models, using unbiased and biased compressors, and sheds light on
the construction of the auxiliary vectors. Furthermore, our general framework
can lead to the improvement of several existing algorithms, and can produce new

primordial non-Gaussianities is hindered by gravitational collapse, to which we
often associate a scale $k_{\rm NL}$. Beyond these scales, it will be hard to
reconstruct the modes sensitive to the primordial distribution. When
forecasting future constraints on the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity,
$f_{\rm NL}$, off-diagonal components are usually neglected in the covariance
because these are small compared to the diagonal. We show that the induced
non-Gaussian off-diagonal components in the covariance degrade forecast
constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity, even when all modes are well within
what is usually considered the linear regime. As a testing ground, we examine
the effects of these off-diagonal components on the constraining power of the
matter bispectrum on $f_{\rm NL}$ as a function of $k_{\rm max}$ and redshift,
confirming our results against N-body simulations out to redshift $z=10$. We
then consider these effects on the hydrogen bispectrum as observed from a
PUMA-like 21-cm intensity mapping survey at redshifts $2<z<6$ and show that not
including off-diagonal covariance over-predicts the constraining power on
$f_{\rm NL}$ by up to a factor of $5$. For future surveys targeting even higher
redshifts, such as Cosmic Dawn and the Dark Ages, which are considered ultimate
surveys for primordial non-Gaussianity, we predict that non-Gaussian covariance
would severely limit prospects to constrain $f_{\rm NL}$ from the bispectrum.

reactions forming complex organic molecules remain valid in an abundant H$_2$O

in H$_2$O- and CO-rich ices under conditions prevailing in molecular clouds.
Therefore, different ice mixtures composed of H$_2$O:CO:NH$_3$ (10:5:1),
CO:NH$_3$ (4:1), and CO:NH$_3$ (0.6:1) were exposed to vacuum ultraviolet
photons in an ultra-high vacuum chamber at 10 K. Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy was utilized to monitor in situ the initial and newly formed
species as a function of photon fluence. The infrared spectral identifications
are complementarily secured by a temperature-programmed desorption experiment
combined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The energetic processing of
CO:NH$_3$ ice mixtures mainly leads to the NH$_2$CHO formation, along with its
chemical derivatives such as isocyanic acid (HNCO) and cyanate ion (OCN$^-$).
The formation kinetics of NH$_2$CHO shows an explicit dependency on ice ratios
and compositions; the highest yield is found in H$_2$O-rich ice. The
astronomical relevance of the resulting reaction network is discussed.

called a survival kernet, which scales to large datasets in a manner that is
amenable to model interpretation and also theoretical analysis. Specifically,
the training data are partitioned into clusters based on a recently developed
training set compression scheme for classification and regression called kernel
netting that we extend to the survival analysis setting. At test-time, each
data point is represented as a weighted combination of these clusters, and each
such cluster can be visualized. For a special case of survival kernets, we
establish a finite-sample error bound on predicted survival distributions that
is, up to a log factor, optimal. Whereas scalability at test time is achieved
using the aforementioned kernel netting compression strategy, scalability
during training is achieved by a warm-start procedure based on tree ensembles
such as XGBoost and a heuristic approach to accelerating neural architecture
search. On three standard survival analysis datasets of varying sizes (up to

class of continuous-time state-space models, such that (a) the latent process
$X_t$ is a linear Gaussian diffusion; and (b) the observations arise from a
Poisson process with intensity $\lambda(X_t)$. The likelihood of the posterior
probability density function of the latent process includes an intractable path
integral. Our algorithm relies on Poisson estimates which approximate
unbiasedly this integral. We show how we can tune these Poisson estimates to
ensure that, with large probability, all but a few of the estimates generated
by the algorithm are positive. Then replacing the negative estimates by zero
leads to a much smaller bias than what would obtain through discretisation. We
quantify the probability of negative estimates for certain special cases and
show that our particle filter is effectively unbiased. We apply our method to a
challenging 3D single molecule tracking example with a Born and Wolf
observation model.

settings like medicine and public policy. Learning optimal policies from
observed data requires a careful formulation of the utility function whose
expected value is maximized across a population. Although researchers typically
use utilities that depend on observed outcomes alone, in many settings the
decision maker's utility function is more properly characterized by the joint
set of potential outcomes under all actions. For example, the Hippocratic
principle to ``do no harm'' implies that the cost of causing death to a patient
who would otherwise survive without treatment is greater than the cost of
forgoing life-saving treatment. We consider optimal policy learning with
asymmetric utility functions of this form. We show that asymmetric utilities
lead to an unidentifiable social welfare function, and so we first partially
identify it. Drawing on statistical decision theory, we then derive minimax
decision rules by minimizing the maximum regret relative to alternative
policies. We show that one can learn minimax decision rules from observed data
by solving intermediate classification problems. We also establish that the
finite sample regret of this procedure is bounded by the mis-classification
rate of these intermediate classifiers. We apply this conceptual framework and
methodology to the decision about whether or not to use right heart
catheterization for patients with possible pulmonary hypertension.

Fluid flow represents a complex dynamic system governed by the Navier-Stokes
equations. General optical flow methods are typically designed for rigid body
motion, and thus struggle if applied to fluid motion estimation directly.
Further, optical flow methods only focus on two consecutive frames without
utilising historical temporal information, while the fluid motion (velocity
field) can be considered a continuous trajectory constrained by time-dependent
partial differential equations (PDEs). This discrepancy has the potential to
induce physically inconsistent estimations. Here we propose an unsupervised
learning based prediction-correction scheme for fluid flow estimation. An
estimate is first given by a PDE-constrained optical flow predictor, which is
then refined by a physical based corrector. The proposed approach outperforms
optical flow methods and shows competitive results compared to existing
supervised learning based methods on a benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the
proposed approach can generalize to complex real-world fluid scenarios where
ground truth information is effectively unknowable. Finally, experiments
demonstrate that the physical corrector can refine flow estimates by mimicking
the operator splitting method commonly utilised in fluid dynamical simulation.

stellar metallicity gradients in feedback driven simulated UDGs from the NIHAO
project and compare them with the observed distribution of metallicity
gradients of both Local Group dwarfs as well as of the recently observed UDG
DF44. Simulated UDGs display a large variety of metallicity profiles, showing
flat to negative gradients, similarly to what is observed in LG dwarfs, while
DF44 data suggest a flat to positive gradient. The variety of metallicity
gradients in simulations is set by the interplay between the radius at which
star formation occurs and the subsequent supernovae feedback driven stellar
redistribution: rotation supported systems tend to have flat metallicity
profiles while dispersion supported galaxies show negative and steep profiles.
  Our results suggest that UDGs are not peculiar in what regards their
metallicity gradients, when compared to regular dwarfs. Desirably, a larger
observational sample of UDGs' gradients shall be available in the future, in

properties of these networks. We employ tools from free probability, random
matrix theory, and one-shot quantum information theory to study random tensor
networks with bounded and unbounded variation in link spectra, and in cases
where a subsystem has one or multiple minimal cuts. If the link states have
bounded spectral variation, the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem
with two minimal cuts can be expressed as a free product of the entanglement
spectra of each cut, along with a Marchenko-Pastur distribution. For a class of
states with unbounded spectral variation, analogous to semiclassical states in
quantum gravity, we relate the limiting entanglement spectrum of a subsystem
with two minimal cuts to the distribution of the minimal entanglement across
the two cuts. In doing so, we draw connections to previous work on split
transfer protocols, entanglement negativity in random tensor networks, and
Euclidean path integrals in quantum gravity.

progresses, and has achieved better ratedistortion (R-D) performance than the
latest traditional method, H.266/VVC, in both subjective metric and the more
challenging objective metric. However, a major problem is that many leading
learned schemes cannot maintain a good trade-off between performance and
complexity. In this paper, we propose an effcient and effective image coding
framework, which achieves similar R-D performance with lower complexity than
the state of the art. First, we develop an improved multi-scale residual block
(MSRB) that can expand the receptive feld and is easier to obtain global
information. It can further capture and reduce the spatial correlation of the
latent representations. Second, a more advanced importance map network is
introduced to adaptively allocate bits to different regions of the image.
Third, we apply a 2D post-quantization flter (PQF) to reduce the quantization
error, motivated by the Sample Adaptive Offset (SAO) flter in video coding.
Moreover, We fnd that the complexity of encoder and decoder have different
effects on image compression performance. Based on this observation, we design
an asymmetric paradigm, in which the encoder employs three stages of MSRBs to
improve the learning capacity, whereas the decoder only needs one stage of MSRB
to yield satisfactory reconstruction, thereby reducing the decoding complexity
without sacrifcing performance. Experimental results show that compared to the
state-of-the-art method, the encoding and decoding time of the proposed method
are about 17 times faster, and the R-D performance is only reduced by less than
1% on both Kodak and Tecnick datasets, which is still better than
H.266/VVC(4:4:4) and other recent learning-based methods. Our source code is

state-of-the-art for data-driven turbulence modeling. In the SL paradigm,
models are trained based on a dataset, which is typically computed a priori
from a high-fidelity solution by applying the respective filter function, which
separates the resolved and the unresolved flow scales. For implicitly filtered
large eddy simulation (LES), this approach is infeasible, since here, the
employed discretization itself acts as an implicit filter function. As a
consequence, the exact filter form is generally not known and thus, the
corresponding closure terms cannot be computed even if the full solution is
available. The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can be used to avoid this
inconsistency by training not on a previously obtained training dataset, but
instead by interacting directly with the dynamical LES environment itself. This
allows to incorporate the potentially complex implicit LES filter into the
training process by design. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning
framework to find an optimal eddy-viscosity for implicitly filtered large eddy
simulations of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. For this, we formulate
the task of turbulence modeling as an RL task with a policy network based on
convolutional neural networks that adapts the eddy-viscosity in LES dynamically
in space and time based on the local flow state only. We demonstrate that the
trained models can provide long-term stable simulations and that they
outperform established analytical models in terms of accuracy. In addition, the
models generalize well to other resolutions and discretizations. We thus
demonstrate that RL can provide a framework for consistent, accurate and stable
turbulence modeling especially for implicitly filtered LES.

Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) is therefore a common
formulation used by these solvers.
  There are many combinatorial optimisation problems that are naturally
represented as permutations e.g., travelling salesman problem. Encoding
permutation problems using binary variables however presents some challenges.
Many QUBO solvers are single flip solvers, it is therefore possible to generate
solutions that cannot be decoded to a valid permutation. To create bias towards
generating feasible solutions, we use penalty weights. The process of setting
static penalty weights for various types of problems is not trivial. This is
because values that are too small will lead to infeasible solutions being
returned by the solver while values that are too large may lead to slower
convergence. In this study, we explore some methods of setting penalty weights
within the context of QUBO formulations. We propose new static methods of
calculating penalty weights which lead to more promising results than existing

diagnosing ASD. This study aims to review the automated detection of ASD using
AI. We review several CADS that have been developed using ML techniques for the

a Knowledge Graph, is adapted for the English language and extended to inject
contextually relevant information into sentences. As a side-effect, changes
made to K-BERT for accommodating the English language also extend to other

a particular property of this technology has been brought to attention:
robustness Neural Networks notoriously present low robustness and can be highly
sensitive to small input perturbations. Recently, many methods for verifying
networks' general properties of robustness have been proposed, but they are
mostly applied in Computer Vision. In this paper we propose a Verification
specification for Natural Language Understanding classification based on larger
regions of interest, and we discuss the challenges of such task. We observe
that, although the data is almost linearly separable, the verifier struggles to
output positive results and we explain the problems and implications.

  Classification","Accepted in IEEE tensymp 2022",,,,"eess.IV eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Manual interpretation and classification of ECG signals lack both accuracy
and reliability. These continuous time-series signals are more effective when
represented as an image for CNN-based classification. A continuous Wavelet
transform filter is used here to get corresponding images. In achieving the
best result generic CNN architectures lack sufficient accuracy and also have a
higher run-time. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble method of
transfer learning-based models to classify ECG signals. In our work, two
modified VGG-16 models and one InceptionResNetV2 model with added feature
extracting layers and ImageNet weights are working as the backbone. After
ensemble, we report an increase of 6.36% accuracy than previous MLP-based
algorithms. After 5-fold cross-validation with the Physionet dataset, our model
reaches an accuracy of 99.98%.

various wireless applications. Specifically, the metaverse can offer virtual

  Intrusions, and Defenses",,"10.1145/3545948.3545976",,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in many graph
mining tasks benefitting from the message passing strategy that fuses the local
structure and node features for better graph representation learning. Despite
the success of GNNs, and similar to other types of deep neural networks, GNNs
are found to be vulnerable to unnoticeable perturbations on both graph
structure and node features. Many adversarial attacks have been proposed to
disclose the fragility of GNNs under different perturbation strategies to
create adversarial examples. However, vulnerability of GNNs to successful
backdoor attacks was only shown recently. In this paper, we disclose the TRAP
attack, a Transferable GRAPh backdoor attack. The core attack principle is to
poison the training dataset with perturbation-based triggers that can lead to
an effective and transferable backdoor attack. The perturbation trigger for a
graph is generated by performing the perturbation actions on the graph
structure via a gradient based score matrix from a surrogate model. Compared
with prior works, TRAP attack is different in several ways: i) it exploits a
surrogate Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model to generate perturbation
triggers for a blackbox based backdoor attack; ii) it generates sample-specific
perturbation triggers which do not have a fixed pattern; and iii) the attack
transfers, for the first time in the context of GNNs, to different GNN models
when trained with the forged poisoned training dataset. Through extensive
evaluations on four real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
the TRAP attack to build transferable backdoors in four different popular GNNs
using four real-world datasets.

  Twin",,,,,"cs.SI cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowing ""what is happening"" and ""what will happen"" of the mobility in a city
is the building block of a data-driven smart city system. In recent years,
mobility digital twin that makes a virtual replication of human mobility and
predicting or simulating the fine-grained movements of the subjects in a
virtual space at a metropolitan scale in near real-time has shown its great
potential in modern urban intelligent systems. However, few studies have
provided practical solutions. The main difficulties are four-folds. 1) The
daily variation of human mobility is hard to model and predict; 2) the
transportation network enforces a complex constraints on human mobility; 3)
generating a rational fine-grained human trajectory is challenging for existing
machine learning models; and 4) making a fine-grained prediction incurs high
computational costs, which is challenging for an online system. Bearing these
difficulties in mind, in this paper we propose a two-stage human mobility
predictor that stratifies the coarse and fine-grained level predictions. In the
first stage, to encode the daily variation of human mobility at a metropolitan
level, we automatically extract citywide mobility trends as crowd contexts and
predict long-term and long-distance movements at a coarse level. In the second
stage, the coarse predictions are resolved to a fine-grained level via a
probabilistic trajectory retrieval method, which offloads most of the heavy
computations to the offline phase. We tested our method using a real-world
mobile phone GPS dataset in the Kanto area in Japan, and achieved good
prediction accuracy and a time efficiency of about 2 min in predicting future
1h movements of about 220K mobile phone users on a single machine to support
more higher-level analysis of mobility prediction.

networks due to their great potential of modeling time-dependent data. Many
empirical algorithms and techniques have been developed. However,
theoretically, it remains unknown whether and to what extent a trained spiking
neural network performs well on unseen data. This work takes one step in this
direction by exploiting the minimum description length principle and thus,
presents an explicit generalization bound for spiking neural networks. Further,
we implement the description length of SNNs through structural stability and
specify the lower and upper bounds of the maximum number of stable bifurcation
solutions, which convert the challenge of qualifying structural stability in
SNNs into a mathematical problem with quantitative properties.

  Grounding","Accepted to CVPR 2022 VizWiz Workshop",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Answer grounding aims to reveal the visual evidence for visual question
answering (VQA), which entails highlighting relevant positions in the image
when answering questions about images. Previous attempts typically tackle this
problem using pretrained object detectors, but without the flexibility for
objects not in the predefined vocabulary. However, these black-box methods
solely concentrate on the linguistic generation, ignoring the visual
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Dual Visual-Linguistic Interaction
(DaVI), a novel unified end-to-end framework with the capability for both
linguistic answering and visual grounding. DaVI innovatively introduces two
visual-linguistic interaction mechanisms: 1) visual-based linguistic encoder
that understands questions incorporated with visual features and produces
linguistic-oriented evidence for further answer decoding, and 2)
linguistic-based visual decoder that focuses visual features on the
evidence-related regions for answer grounding. This way, our approach ranked
the 1st place in the answer grounding track of 2022 VizWiz Grand Challenge.

  Challenges and their Effects on MOSFET Device Performance",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since the 1960's when Gordon Moore proposed that the transistor density in
our electronic devices should double every two years while the cost is halved,
the semiconductor industry has taken this statement to heart. Over the last few
decades, no other industry has seen growth even comparably close to that
experienced by the semiconductors industry. This has all been made possible by
the unbroken string of ingenious breakthroughs by brilliant minds that have
been working tirelessly to shrink down transistors. The latest of which is the
use of high-k dielectrics and a return to metal gates combined with
3D-transistor architectures. This has been the enabling technology for the
transition from the 90 nm node to the 45 nm node, allowing us to shrink our
transistors further without losing additional gate control. The fundamental
reason for using a high-k gate dielectric compared to SiO2 is that shrinking
our gate oxide further, which is already at a few angstroms, is no longer a
feasible option to gain additional gate control. High-k dielectric overcome
this by exploiting the fundamental physics of capacitors and the materials
science of dielectrics to provide a viable option to increase gate control
without the need for successively thinner gate oxides. Hafnium Oxide is the
most studied and popular of such materials. Its high dielectric constant ~16-25
and interface stability with silicon at operating temperatures make it an ideal
candidate for use in current CMOS technology. Despite its deceivingly simple
appearance, the processes involved in the fabrication of such high-k HfO2/Si
interfaces are full of process subtleties and nuances. In this term paper we
hope to explore the physics and materials science of these high-k HfO2/Si
interfaces, discussing the challenges and ways to overcome them when it comes
to its actual fabrication, and how this ultimately affects our device
performance.
