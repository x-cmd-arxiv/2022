Accepted at IEEE VIS 2022",,,,"cs.HC cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual analytics is arguably the most important step in getting acquainted
with your data. This is especially the case for time series, as this data type
is hard to describe and cannot be fully understood when using for example
summary statistics. To realize effective time series visualization, four
requirements have to be met; a tool should be (1) interactive, (2) scalable to
millions of data points, (3) integrable in conventional data science
environments, and (4) highly configurable. We observe that open source Python
visualization toolkits empower data scientists in most visual analytics tasks,
but lack the combination of scalability and interactivity to realize effective
time series visualization. As a means to facilitate these requirements, we
created Plotly-Resampler, an open source Python library. Plotly-Resampler is an
add-on for Plotly's Python bindings, enhancing line chart scalability on top of
an interactive toolkit by aggregating the underlying data depending on the
current graph view. Plotly-Resampler is built to be snappy, as the reactivity
of a tool qualitatively affects how analysts visually explore and analyze data.
A benchmark task highlights how our toolkit scales better than alternatives in
terms of number of samples and time series. Additionally, Plotly-Resampler's
flexible data aggregation functionality paves the path towards researching
novel aggregation techniques. Plotly-Resampler's integrability, together with
its configurability, convenience, and high scalability, allows to effectively
analyze high-frequency data in your day-to-day Python environment.

of discrete individuals that can move according to certain rules. It is usually
the case that large masses concentrated in small regions of space have a great
impact on the collective movement of the group. For this reason, many models in
mathematical biology have incorporated crowding effects and managed to
understand their implications. Here, we build on a previously developed
framework for random walks on networks to show that in the continuum limit, the
underlying stochastic process can be identified with a diffusion partial
differential equation. The diffusion coefficient of the emerging equation is in
general density-dependent, and can be directly related to the transition
probabilities of the random walk. Moreover, the relaxation time of the
stochastic process is directly linked to the diffusion coefficient and also to
the network structure, as it usually happens in the case of linear diffusion.
As a specific example, we study the equivalent of a porous-medium type equation
on networks, which shows similar properties to its continuum equivalent. For
this equation, self-similar solutions on a lattice and on homogeneous trees can
be found, showing finite speed of propagation in contrast to commonly used
linear diffusion equations. These findings also provide insights into
reaction-diffusion systems with general diffusion operators, which have
appeared recently in some applications.

rates, we use the long-term average of the quadratic deviation from consensus

addition, we derive the asymptotic order of the performance measure as a
function of the number of agents under both triggering schemes.

utilize various deep networks to train KWS models with all users' speech data
centralized without considering data privacy. Federated KWS (FedKWS) could
serve as a solution without directly sharing users' data. However, the small
amount of data, different user habits, and various accents could lead to fatal
problems, e.g., overfitting or weight divergence. Hence, we propose several
strategies to encourage the model not to overfit user-specific information in
FedKWS. Specifically, we first propose an adversarial learning strategy, which
updates the downloaded global model against an overfitted local model and
explicitly encourages the global model to capture user-invariant information.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive local training strategy, letting clients
with more training data and more uniform class distributions undertake more
local update steps. Equivalently, this strategy could weaken the negative
impacts of those users whose data is less qualified. Our proposed FedKWS-UI
could explicitly and implicitly learn user-invariant information in FedKWS.
Abundant experimental results on federated Google Speech Commands verify the
effectiveness of FedKWS-UI.

method that locally approximates the solution set of the lower-level problem

when the upper-level objective is non-convex, our method requires

find an $(\epsilon_f,\epsilon_g)$-optimal solution. We also prove stronger

evolved into what we see today. The BUDDI-MaNGA project aims to study galaxy
evolution and morphological transformations through the star-formation
histories of the bulges and discs. We have applied our BUDDI software to
galaxies from the MaNGA Survey in the SDSS DR15 in order to isolate their bulge
and disc spectra, from which we derived their stellar populations. To date,
this work provides the largest sample of clean bulge and disc spectra extracted
from IFU datacubes using the galaxies light profile information, and will form
the basis for a series of papers aiming to answer open questions on how
galaxies have formed and evolved, and the role of their individual structures.
This paper presents an introduction to the project, including an overview of
these fits, a characterisation of the sample, and a series of tests on the fits
to ensure reliability.

in spiral galaxies and their transformation into S0s. These processes affect
the bulge and disc in different ways, and so by isolating the bulge and disc
spectra, we can look for these characteristic signatures. In this work, we used
BUDDI to cleanly extract the spectra of the bulges and discs of 78 S0 galaxies
in the MaNGA Survey. We compared the luminosity and mass weighted stellar
populations of the bulges and discs, finding that bulges are generally older
and more metal rich than their discs. When considering the mass and environment
of each galaxy, we found that the galaxy stellar mass plays a more significant
role on the formation of the bulges. Bulges in galaxies with masses
$\geq10^{10}M_\odot$ built up the majority of their mass rapidly early in their
lifetimes, while those in lower mass galaxies formed over more extended
timescales and more recently. No clear difference was found in the formation or
quenching processes of the discs as a function of galaxy environment. We
conclude that more massive S0 galaxies formed through an inside-out scenario,
where the bulge formed first and evolved passively while the disc underwent a
more extended period of star formation. In lower mass S0s, the bulges and discs
either formed together from the same material, or through an outside-in
scenario. Our results therefore imply multiple formation mechanisms for S0
galaxies, the pathway of which is chiefly determined by a galaxy's current
stellar mass.

the presence of hard samples and mislabeled samples. In this work, we propose a
simple yet effective regularization, namely Listwise Self-Distillation (LSD),
which progressively distills a model's own knowledge to adaptively assign a
more appropriate distance target to each sample pair in a batch. LSD encourages
smoother embeddings and information mining within positive (negative) samples
as a way to mitigate overfitting and thus improve generalization. Our LSD can
be directly integrated into general DML frameworks. Extensive experiments show
that LSD consistently boosts the performance of various metric learning methods

Different concepts and schemes for dissemination and fusion of sensor data have

Specifically, when the measurement error from the sensors (also referred as

fusion process is restricted, which represents a major challenge in the
calibration of sensors. In this paper, we consider sensor data sharing and
fusion in a vehicular network with both, vehicle-to-infrastructure and

Feedback Noise Estimation (BiFNoE), in which an edge server collects and caches
sensor measurement data from vehicles. The edge estimates the noise and the

However, porting Transformer to sample-efficient visual control remains a
challenging and unsolved problem. To this end, we propose a novel Control
Transformer (CtrlFormer), possessing many appealing benefits that prior arts do
not have. Firstly, CtrlFormer jointly learns self-attention mechanisms between
visual tokens and policy tokens among different control tasks, where multitask
representation can be learned and transferred without catastrophic forgetting.
Secondly, we carefully design a contrastive reinforcement learning paradigm to
train CtrlFormer, enabling it to achieve high sample efficiency, which is
important in control problems. For example, in the DMControl benchmark, unlike
recent advanced methods that failed by producing a zero score in the ""Cartpole""

state-of-the-art score with only 100k samples while maintaining the performance
of previous tasks. The code and models are released in our project homepage.

outdoor, we mount the spectrum analyzer on a car seat and drive on the selected

the laboratory for indoor. The frequency of interest in this study is 1.9 - 2.5
GHz, including both licensed and unlicensed bands. Temporal and frequency
domain behavior is compared between licensed and unlicensed bands. We first
normalize and binarize the data with a threshold. Then we calculate the
spectrum occupancy by counting how many consecutive ones. Based on our
observation, the spectrum occupancy of the outdoor environment is more
remarkable than the indoor environment. The interference in the licensed band
shows more variations in the frequency domain than that in the unlicensed band.
This study provides a better understanding of the interference behavior for

data from the eBird project consisting of 186,811 checklist records comprising
430 bird species. We evaluate the predictions on a spatially separated test set
of 59,338 records, comparing two different inference methods -- Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI) -- to occupancy models fitted
to each species separately using maximum likelihood. We fitted models to the

entire dataset performed best, outperforming single-species models on both AUC
(90.4% compared to 88.7%) and on log likelihood (-0.080 compared to -0.085). We
also evaluate how well range maps predicted by the model agree with expert
maps. We find that modelling the detection process greatly improves agreement
and that the resulting maps agree as closely with expert maps as ones estimated
using high quality survey data. Our results demonstrate that multi-species
occupancy models are a compelling approach to model large citizen science
datasets, and that, once the observation process is taken into account, they

detail and is taken as the basis of the quantization of classical Lie groups,
as well as some Lie supergroups. We start by laying out the foundations of
non-commutative and non-cocommutative Hopf algebras. Much attention has been
paid to Hecke and Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) R-matrices and related quantum

with the quantum groups GL_q(N), SO_q(N), Sp_q(2n) and supergroups GL_q(N|M),
Osp_q(N|2m), as well as their rational (Yangian) limits, are presented.
Rational R-matrices for exceptional Lie algebras and elliptic solutions of the
Yang-Baxter equation are also considered. The basic concepts of the group
algebra of the braid group and its finite dimensional quotients (such as Hecke

Hecke and BMW algebras is given (including methods for finding idempotents and
their quantum dimensions). Applications of the theory of quantum groups and

  An empirical study","Under Peer review in Empirical Software Engineering Journal",,,,"cs.SE cs.DC cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The Ethereum platform allows developers to implement and deploy applications
called Dapps onto the blockchain for public use through the use of smart
contracts. To execute code within a smart contract, a paid transaction must be
issued towards one of the functions that are exposed in the interface of a
contract. However, such a transaction is only processed once one of the miners
in the peer-to-peer network selects it, adds it to a block, and appends that
block to the blockchain This creates a delay between transaction submission and
code execution. It is crucial for Dapp developers to be able to precisely
estimate when transactions will be processed, since this allows them to define
and provide a certain Quality of Service (QoS) level (e.g., 95% of the
transactions processed within 1 minute). However, the impact that different
factors have on these times have not yet been studied. Processing time
estimation services are used by Dapp developers to achieve predefined QoS. Yet,
these services offer minimal insights into what factors impact processing
times. Considering the vast amount of data that surrounds the Ethereum
blockchain, changes in processing times are hard for Dapp developers to
predict, making it difficult to maintain said QoS. In our study, we build
random forest models to understand the factors that are associated with
transaction processing times. We engineer several features that capture
blockchain internal factors, as well as gas pricing behaviors of transaction
issuers. By interpreting our models, we conclude that features surrounding gas
pricing behaviors are very strongly associated with transaction processing
times. Based on our empirical results, we provide Dapp developers with concrete
insights that can help them provide and maintain high levels of QoS.

family of networks indexed by the number of phosphorylation sites $n$. This
work addresses the problem of understanding the parameter region where this
family of networks displays multistationarity, by focusing on the projection of
this region onto the set of kinetic parameters. The problem is phrased in the
context of real algebraic geometry and reduced to studying whether a
polynomial, defined as the determinant of a parametric matrix of size three,
attains negative values over the positive orthant. The coefficients of the
polynomial are functions of the kinetic parameters. For any $n$, we provide
sufficient conditions for the polynomial to be positive and hence, preclude
multistationarity, and also sufficient conditions for it to attain negative
values and hence, enable multistationarity. These conditions are derived by
exploiting the structure of the polynomial, its Newton polytope, and employing
circuit polynomials. A relevant consequence of our results is that the set of
kinetic parameters that enable or preclude multistationarity are both connected
for all $n$.

spaces grows from 7 on 2 events, to 2644 on 3 events, to an unknown number on 4
events (likely around a billion). For perspective, previous literature on
non-locality and contextuality used a single one of the 2644 available spaces

$\mathbf{w}^\ast\in\mathbb{R}^d$ achieving $F(\mathbf{w}^\ast)=\epsilon$, where
$F(\mathbf{w})=\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}[(\sigma(\mathbf{w}\cdot

$\mathbf{w}$ such that $F(\mathbb{w})=C\, \epsilon$ with high probability,
where $C>1$ is a universal constant. As our main contribution, we give
efficient constant-factor approximate learners for a broad class of
distributions (including log-concave distributions) and activation functions.
Concretely, for the class of isotropic log-concave distributions, we obtain the
following important corollaries:
  For the logistic activation, we obtain the first polynomial-time constant
factor approximation (even under the Gaussian distribution). Our algorithm has
sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$, which is tight within
polylogarithmic factors.
  For the ReLU activation, we give an efficient algorithm with sample
complexity $\tilde{O}(d\, \polylog(1/\epsilon))$. Prior to our work, the best
known constant-factor approximate learner had sample complexity
$\tilde{\Omega}(d/\epsilon)$.
  In both of these settings, our algorithms are simple, performing
gradient-descent on the (regularized) $L_2^2$-loss. The correctness of our
algorithms relies on novel structural results that we establish, showing that
(essentially all) stationary points of the underlying non-convex loss are
approximately optimal.

image-text datasets, which are either annotated by enormous human labors, or
crawled from the internet followed by elaborate data cleaning techniques. To
reduce the dependency on well-aligned image-text pairs, it is promising to
directly leverage the large-scale text-only and image-only corpora. This paper
proposes a data augmentation method, namely cross-modal CutMix (CMC), for
implicit cross-modal alignment learning in unpaired VLP. Specifically, CMC
transforms natural sentences from the textual view into a multi-modal view,
where visually-grounded words in a sentence are randomly replaced by diverse
image patches with similar semantics. There are several appealing proprieties
of the proposed CMC. First, it enhances the data diversity while keeping the
semantic meaning intact for tackling problems where the aligned data are
scarce; Second, by attaching cross-modal noise on uni-modal data, it guides
models to learn token-level interactions across modalities for better
denoising. Furthermore, we present a new unpaired VLP method, dubbed as
VLMixer, that integrates CMC with contrastive learning to pull together the
uni-modal and multi-modal views for better instance-level alignments among
different modalities. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks show that
VLMixer could surpass previous state-of-the-art unpaired VLP methods.

downstream autonomous driving tasks. Extensive experiments show that
VectorMapNet achieve strong map learning performance on both nuScenes and

Given a garment grasp point, the robot explores different parameterized fling
trajectories in physical experiments. To improve learning efficiency, we
propose a coarse-to-fine learning method that first uses a multi-armed bandit
(MAB) framework to efficiently find a candidate fling action, which it then
refines via a continuous optimization method. Further, we propose novel
training and execution-time stopping criteria based on fling outcome
uncertainty; the training-time stopping criterion increases data efficiency
while the execution-time stopping criteria leverage repeated fling actions to
increase performance. Compared to baselines, the proposed method significantly
accelerates learning. Moreover, with prior experience on similar garments
collected through self-supervision, the MAB learning time for a new garment is
reduced by up to 87%. We evaluate on 36 real garments: towels, T-shirts,
long-sleeve shirts, dresses, sweat pants, and jeans. Results suggest that using

properties of (persistent) homotopy types of sufficiently regular spaces.
Classical notions of stratified homotopy equivalence generally turn out to be
too rigid to display similar behavior. At the same time, recent developments in
abstract stratified homotopy theory employ weaker notions of stratified
equivalences. These exhibit behavior more suitable for the purpose of TDA while
still retaining the same homotopy theoretical information as classical
stratified homotopy equivalences for common examples such as Whitney stratified
spaces. In this work, we establish a notion of persistent stratified homotopy
type obtained from a sample with two strata. We show that it behaves much like
its non-stratified counterpart and exhibits many properties (such as stability)
necessary for an application in TDA. Using local approximations of tangent
cones, we describe a pipeline to construct a persistent stratified homotopy
type from a non-stratified sample without prior knowledge of the location of
the singularity. Our main result is a sampling theorem which guarantees that
for a class of Whitney stratified spaces with two strata, our method produces
arbitrarily close approximations of the persistent stratified homotopy type of
the original space for sufficiently good samples.

depending on whether there is easy-plane anisotropy. The skyrmion defect of the
CDW order carries physical charge $2e$ and its condensation leads to a
topological superconductor. The CDW-SC transitions are in the same universality
classes as the celebrated deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP) between
Neel order and valence bond solid order on square lattice. Both SC and CDW
order can be accessed from the CSL phase through a continuous phase transition.
At the CSL-SC transition, there is still CDW order fluctuations although CDW is
absent in both sides. We propose three different theories for the CSL-SC
transition (and CSL to easy-plane CDW transition): a $U(1)$ theory with two
bosons, a $U(1)$ theory with two Dirac fermions, and an $SU(2)$ theory with two
bosons. Our construction offers a derivation of the duality between these three
theories as well as a promising physical realization. The $SU(2)$ theory offers
a unified framework for a series of fixed points with explicit $SO(5), O(4)$ or
$SO(3)\times O(2)$ symmetry. There is also a transparent duality transformation
mapping SC order to easy-plane CDW order. The CSL-SC-CDW tri-critical points
are invariant under this duality mapping and have an enlarged $SO(5)$ or $O(4)$
symmetry. The DQCPs between CDW and SC inherit the enlarged symmetry, emergent

minimally coupled to gravity. We consider all possible production regimes:
purely gravitational, weak direct coupling (perturbative), and strong direct
coupling (non-perturbative). For each regime, we use different approaches to
determine the dark matter phase space distribution and the corresponding relic
abundance. For the purely gravitational regime, scalar dark matter quanta are
copiously excited during inflation resulting in an infrared (IR) dominated
distribution function and a relic abundance which overcloses the universe for a
reheating temperature $T_\text{reh}>34 ~\text{GeV}$. A non-vanishing direct
coupling induces an effective DM mass and suppresses the large IR modes in
favor of ultraviolet (UV) modes and a minimal scalar abundance is generated
when the interference between the direct and gravitational couplings is
maximal. For large direct couplings, backreaction on the inflaton condensate is
accounted for by using the Hartree approximation and lattice simulation
techniques. Since scalar DM candidates can behave as non-cold dark matter, we
estimate the impact of such species on the matter power spectrum and derive the
corresponding constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ measurements. We find that
they correspond to a lower bound on the DM mass of $\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-4} \,

direct coupling production. We discuss the implications of these results.

show that the specific star formation rates of LSBGs are not significantly
different from those of high surface brightness galaxies (HSBGs) but, as a
population, LSBGs are systematically less massive and more extended than HSBGs,
and tend to display late-type morphologies according to a kinematic criterion.
At fixed stellar mass, we find that haloes hosting LSBGs are systematically
more massive and have a higher baryonic fraction than those hosting HSBGs. We
find that LSBGs have higher stellar specific angular momentum and halo spin
parameter values compared to HSBGs, as suggested by previous works. We track
the evolution of these quantities back in time, finding that the spin
parameters of the haloes hosting LSBGs and HSBGs exhibit a clear bifurcation at
$z \sim 2$, which causes a similar separation in the evolutionary tracks of
other properties such as galactic angular momentum and effective radius,
ultimately resulting in the values observed at $z =$ 0. The higher values of
specific stellar angular momentum and halo spin in LSBGs seem to be responsible
for their extended nature, preventing material from collapsing into the central

functions. In this Part I, we demonstrate that in the presence of such fluxes
the theories can be formulated for arbitrary gauge bundles on a compact
four-manifold. Moreover, we consider arbitrary masses for the hypermultiplets,
which introduce new intricacies for the evaluation of the low-energy path
integral on the Coulomb branch. We develop techniques for the evaluation of
these path integrals. In the forthcoming Part II, we will deal with the

we developed various machine learning models to predict PEF values using the

gamma ray (GR), compressional and shear velocity.
  The predictions of PEF values using adaptive-network-fuzzy inference system

superior outcome of the ML method in the removal of noise as well as scanning
artifacts - including on features not simulated in the training set. An
extension to larger STM images is further discussed, along with intrinsic
limitations arising from training set biases that discourage application to
fundamentally unknown surface features. The approach demonstrated here provides
an effective way to remove noise and artifacts from typical STM images,

blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as Dapps. When
engineering Dapps, developers need to translate requests captured in the
front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions.
Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the
higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed.
Therefore developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction
fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have
been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., Dapp developers) with an
estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas
price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several
popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, their accuracy has not
been empirically investigated so far. In this paper, we quantify the
transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between
processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of
state-of-the-practice estimation services. We find that transactions are
processed in a median of 57s and that 90% of the transactions are processed
within 8m. The higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times
with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in
processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. In terms of
accuracy of processing time estimation services, we note that they are
equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, Etherscan's
Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for very cheap and cheap

application in different cases. First, the system is tested on a set of number
series used in IQ tests collected from various sources. Next, our model is
successfully applied on the sequences used to evaluate the models reported in
the literature. In both cases, the system is capable of solving these types of
problems in less than a second using standard computing power. Finally,
KitBit's algorithms have been applied for the first time to the complete set of
entire sequences of the well-known OEIS database. We find a pattern in the form
of a list of algorithms and predict the following terms in the largest number
of series to date. These results demonstrate the potential of KitBit to solve
complex problems that could be represented numerically.

with very high or catastrophic consequences at societal scale. The US National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been developing the NIST
Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) as voluntary
guidance on AI risk assessment and management for AI developers and others. For
addressing risks of events with catastrophic consequences, NIST indicated a
need to translate from high level principles to actionable risk management
guidance.
  In this document, we provide detailed actionable-guidance recommendations
focused on identifying and managing risks of events with very high or
catastrophic consequences, intended as a risk management practices resource for
NIST for AI RMF version 1.0 (released in January 2023), or for AI RMF users, or
for other AI risk management guidance and standards as appropriate. We also
provide our methodology for our recommendations.
  We provide actionable-guidance recommendations for AI RMF 1.0 on: identifying
risks from potential unintended uses and misuses of AI systems; including
catastrophic-risk factors within the scope of risk assessments and impact
assessments; identifying and mitigating human rights harms; and reporting
information on AI risk factors including catastrophic-risk factors.
  In addition, we provide recommendations on additional issues for a roadmap
for later versions of the AI RMF or supplementary publications. These include:
providing an AI RMF Profile with supplementary guidance for cutting-edge
increasingly multi-purpose or general-purpose AI.
  We aim for this work to be a concrete risk-management practices contribution,
and to stimulate constructive dialogue on how to address catastrophic risks and
associated issues in AI standards.

of patients. Many forecasting methods have been used in real-time during the
Influenza seasons and submitted to the CDC for public communication. The
forecasting models range from mechanistic models, and auto-regression models to
machine learning models. We hypothesize that we can improve forecasting by
using multiple mechanistic models to produce potential trajectories and use
machine learning to learn how to combine those trajectories into an improved
forecast. We propose a Tree Ensemble model design that utilizes the individual
predictors of our baseline model SIkJalpha to improve its performance. Each
predictor is generated by changing a set of hyper-parameters. We compare our
prospective forecasts deployed for the FluSight challenge (2022) to all the
other submitted approaches. Our approach is fully automated and does not
require any manual tuning. We demonstrate that our Random Forest-based approach
is able to improve upon the forecasts of the individual predictors in terms of
mean absolute error, coverage, and weighted interval score. Our method
outperforms all other models in terms of the mean absolute error and the
weighted interval score based on the mean across all weekly submissions in the

calculations of the total energy as a function of the spin magnetic moment
using the fixed spin moment method. We show that the spontaneous magnetization
in the studied systems arises from an electronic instability by the presence of
a narrow impurity band at the Fermi level. Furthermore, we found that the
emergence of spin polarization requires the impurity to introduce an extra
electron to the graphene lattice and that the impurity-carbon hybridization is
close to the $sp^3$ geometry. These features reveal that the charge doping sign
and the hybridization degree play a fundamental role in the origin of $sp$

selecting a proper covariance function. The moving average, or process
convolutions, construction of GPs allows some additional flexibility, but still
requires choosing a proper smoothing kernel, which is non-trivial. Previous
approaches have built covariance functions by using GP priors over the
smoothing kernel, and by extension the covariance, as a way to bypass the need
to specify it in advance. However, such models have been limited in several
ways: they are restricted to single dimensional inputs, e.g. time; they only
allow modelling of single outputs and they do not scale to large datasets since
inference is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric
process convolution formulation for GPs that alleviates these weaknesses by
using a functional sampling approach based on Matheron's rule to perform fast
sampling using interdomain inducing variables. Furthermore, we propose a
composition of these nonparametric convolutions that serves as an alternative
to classic deep GP models, and allows the covariance functions of the
intermediate layers to be inferred from the data. We test the performance of
our model on benchmarks for single output GPs, multiple output GPs and deep GPs
and find that our approach can provide improvements over standard GP models,
particularly for larger datasets.

This paper proposes a new method to choose the best dimensionality reduction

be user-defined, or it can be automatically defined by the method. The method
applies a regression or a classification, evaluates the results, and gives a
diagnosis about the best dimensionality reduction process in this specific

multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network algorithm. Six use cases are
presented, and every one is based on some well-known technique to generate
synthetic data. This research discusses each choice that can be made in the

with the feature importance. The result can be good if all of the feature's
importance is similar. However, in most cases, the importance of the features
is imbalanced, and it can induce an important bias on the features and global

filter that selects a range of minimum and maximum membership values,
emphasizing the border data. A {\mu} parameter defines the amplitude of this
range. It finally applies a k-means algorithm using the membership values
generated by the FCM. Naturally, the data having similar membership values will
regroup in a new crispy cluster. The algorithm is also able to find the optimal
number of clusters for the FCM and the k-means algorithm, according to the
consistency of the clusters given by the Silhouette Index (SI). The result is a
list of data and clusters that regroup data sharing the same intersection,

follow-up, allowing deeper understanding of source mechanisms. BURSTT will
provide horizon-to-horizon sky coverage with a half power field-of-view (FoV)
of $\sim$10$^{4}$ deg$^{2}$, a 400 MHz effective bandwidth between 300-800 MHz,
and sub-arcsecond localization, made possible using outrigger stations hundreds

antennas. After tests of various antenna designs and optimization of system
performance we plan to expand to 2048 antennas. We estimate that BURSTT-256

Another advantage of BURSTT's large FoV and continuous operation will be
greatly enhanced monitoring of FRBs for repetition. The current lack of

  with Adjustable Sharpness","Accepted by MICCAI 2022",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a valuable tool for
studying metabolic activities in the human body, but the current applications
are limited to low spatial resolutions. The existing deep learning-based MRSI
super-resolution methods require training a separate network for each upscaling
factor, which is time-consuming and memory inefficient. We tackle this
multi-scale super-resolution problem using a Filter Scaling strategy that
modulates the convolution filters based on the upscaling factor, such that a
single network can be used for various upscaling factors. Observing that each
metabolite has distinct spatial characteristics, we also modulate the network
based on the specific metabolite. Furthermore, our network is conditioned on
the weight of adversarial loss so that the perceptual sharpness of the
super-resolved metabolic maps can be adjusted within a single network. We
incorporate these network conditionings using a novel Multi-Conditional Module.
The experiments were carried out on a 1H-MRSI dataset from 15 high-grade glioma
patients. Results indicate that the proposed network achieves the best
performance among several multi-scale super-resolution methods and can provide
super-resolved metabolic maps with adjustable sharpness.

cancer-related mortality worldwide. Performing colon cancer screening in a
timely fashion is the key to early detection. Colonoscopy is the primary
modality used to diagnose colon cancer. However, the miss rate of polyps,
adenomas and advanced adenomas remains significantly high. Early detection of
polyps at the precancerous stage can help reduce the mortality rate and the
economic burden associated with colorectal cancer. Deep learning-based
computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system may help gastroenterologists to identify
polyps that may otherwise be missed, thereby improving the polyp detection
rate. Additionally, CADx system could prove to be a cost-effective system that
improves long-term colorectal cancer prevention. In this study, we proposed a
deep learning-based architecture for automatic polyp segmentation, called
Transformer ResU-Net (TransResU-Net). Our proposed architecture is built upon
residual blocks with ResNet-50 as the backbone and takes the advantage of
transformer self-attention mechanism as well as dilated convolution(s). Our
experimental results on two publicly available polyp segmentation benchmark
datasets showed that TransResU-Net obtained a highly promising dice score and a
real-time speed. With high efficacy in our performance metrics, we concluded
that TransResU-Net could be a strong benchmark for building a real-time polyp

colorectal cancer. The source code of the proposed TransResU-Net is publicly

the largest compilation to date of this type. The dwarf galaxies in our sample
mostly show metallicity profiles decreasing with radius, with some exhibiting
rather steep profiles. The derived metallicity gradients as a function of the
half-light radius, $\nabla_{\rm [Fe/H]} (R/R_e)$, show no statistical
differences when compared with the galaxies' morphological type, nor with their
distance from the Milky Way or M31. No correlations are found with either
stellar mass or star formation timescales. In particular, we do not find the
linear relationship between $\nabla_{\rm [Fe/H]} (R/R_e)$ and the galaxies'
median age $t_{50}$, as instead shown in the literature for a set of simulated
systems. The presence of high angular momentum in some of our galaxies does not
seem to have an impact on the gradient values. The strongest gradients in our
sample are observed in systems that are likely to have experienced a past
merger event. By excluding them, the analysed dwarf galaxies show mild
gradients ($\sim -0.1$ dex $R_e^{-1}$) with little scatter between them,
regardless of their stellar mass, dynamical state, and star formation history.
These results are in good agreement with different sets of simulations
presented in the literature and analysed using the same method as for the

popular reduced-order modeling methods. In this paper, we show that the left
singular vectors of this Hankel matrix are a discrete approximation of
classical space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes, and the
singular values are square roots of the POD energies. This connection
establishes a clear interpretation of the Hankel modes grounded in classical
theory, and we gain insights into the Hankel modes by instead analyzing the
equivalent discrete space-time POD modes in terms of the correlation matrix
formed by multiplying the Hankel matrix by its conjugate transpose. These
insights include the distinct meaning of rows and columns, the implied norm in
which the modes are optimal, the impact of the time step between snapshots on
the modes, and an interpretation of the embedding dimension/height of the
Hankel matrix in terms of the time window on which the modes are optimal.
Moreover, the connections we establish offer opportunities to improve the
convergence and computation time in certain practical cases, and to improve the
accuracy of the modes with the same data. Finally, popular variants of POD,

limits that snapshots used to form each column of the Hankel matrix represent

correlation functions are discussed. The first one is the lack of a
well-behaved expression that is valid at both high-temperature and $T \to 0$ K
limits. Specifically, if the partition function and the propagator are
considered separately, then thermal vibrational correlation functions may have
an indeterminate form 0/0 in the limit $T \to 0$ K. This difficulty is resolved
when the partition function and the propagator are jointly considered in the
harmonic approximation, which allows a problematic term that emanates from the
zero-point energy to be cancelled out thereby producing a thermal correlation
function with a determinate form in $T \to 0$ K limit. The second difficulty is
related to the multivaluedness of the vibrational correlation function. We show
numerically that an improper selection of branch leads to discontinuities in
the computed correlation function and an incorrect vibronic spectra. We propose
a phase tracking procedure that ensures continuity of both real and imaginary
parts of the correlation function to recover the correct spectra. We support
our findings by simulating the UV-vis absorption spectra of pentacene at 4 K
and benzene at 298 K. Both are found to be in good agreement with their

training. Thus, having a sufficient number of low-energy structures in the
training set, the method allows to generate new candidates for the ground-state
structures, including ones with larger number of atoms. We applied the approach
to silica clusters $(SiO_2)_n$ and for the first time found the stable
structures with n=28...51. The method is universal and does not depend on the
atomic composition and number of atoms.

quantum systems. Among these theories, the method of moments of coupled-cluster
equations (MMCCs) and the ensuing classes of the renormalized coupled-cluster
(CC) approaches have evolved into one of the most accurate approaches to
describe correlation effects in various quantum systems. The MMCC formalism
provides an effective way for correcting energies of approximate CC
formulations (parent theories) using moments, or CC equations, that are not
used to determine approximate cluster amplitudes. In this paper, we propose a
quantum algorithm for computing MMCC ground-state energies that provide two
main advantages over classical computing or other quantum algorithms: (i) the
possibility of forming superpositions of CC moments of arbitrary ranks in the
entire Hilbert space and using an arbitrary form of the parent cluster operator
for MMCC expansion; and (ii) significant reduction in the number of
measurements in quantum simulation through a compact unitary representation for
a generally non-unitary operator. We illustrate the robustness of our approach
over a broad class of test cases, including ~40 molecular systems with varying
basis sets encoded using 4~40 qubits, and exhibit the detailed MMCC analysis
for the 8-qubit half-filled, four-site, single impurity Anderson model and
12-qubit hydrogen fluoride molecular system from the corresponding noise-free

model, consisting of a shuttling ring that moves along a track containing
interspersed binding sites and catalytic sites. The binding sites attract the
shuttling ring while the catalytic sites speed up a reaction between molecular
species, which can be thought of as fuel and waste. When that fuel and waste
are held in a nonequilibrium steady state, the free energy from the reaction
drives directed motion of the shuttling ring along the track. Using this model
and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics, we show that the shuttling ring's
direction can be reversed by simply adjusting the spacing between binding and
catalytic sites on the track. We present a steric mechanism behind the current
reversal, supported by kinetic measurements from the simulations. These results
demonstrate how molecular simulation can guide future development of artificial

Latent Inceptionism on Molecules (LIMO), which significantly accelerates

Such a model can be implemented by a finite element analysis, multibody systems
approach, etc. Designs passing this simulation are then considered for physical
prototyping. The overall process may take months, and is a significant cost in
practice. We have developed a Bayesian optimization system for partially
automating this process by directly optimizing compliance with the target
specification with respect to the design parameters. The proposed method is a
general framework for computing a generalized inverse of a high-dimensional
non-linear function that does not require e.g. gradient information, which is
often unavailable from discipline models. We furthermore develop a two-tier
convergence criterion based on (i) convergence to a solution optimally
satisfying all specified design criteria, or (ii) convergence to a minimum-norm
solution. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a vehicle chassis design
problem motivated by an industry setting using a state-of-the-art commercial
discipline model. We show that the proposed approach is general, scalable, and
efficient, and that the novel convergence criteria can be implemented
straightforwardly based on existing concepts and subroutines in popular
Bayesian optimization software packages.

point) and an eigenvalue, which is also the initial condition at the stellar
surface. Then, to obtain this eigenvalue, we set it as a radial quantity and
perform a detailed topological analysis. Thereafter, we describe a numerical
method for solving either Nodal and Saddle transonic solutions. The value of
the viscosity,""alpha"", barely determine the location of the sonic point, but it
determines the topology of the solution. We found two Nodal solutions, which
are almost indistinguishable between them. Saddle solutions are founded for
lower values of ""alpha"" than the required of the Nodal solutions. In addition,
rotational velocity do not play a determine role in the velocity (and density)
profile, because viscosity effects collapse all the solutions to almost a
unique one in a small region above the stellar surface. A suitable combination
of line force parameters and/or disk temperature, give location of the sonic

feature in atomic nucleus associated to nuclear magnetism induced by spin and
orbital transition operator. So far it has only been investigated within the
non-relativistic theoretical approaches, and available experimental data are
rather limited. Purpose: We aim to investigate the properties of M2 transitions
in closed and open-shell nuclei using the framework of relativistic nuclear
energy density functional. The calculated M2 transition strengths could be used
to constrain the quenching of the spin gyromagnetic factors. Methods: The M2
excitations are described using the relativistic quasiparticle random phase
approximation (RQRPA) with the residual interaction extended with the
isovector-pseudovector term. Results: The M2 transition strength distributions
are described and analyzed for closed and open shell nuclei. The results are
compared with available experimental data and the strength missing from the
experiment is discussed. The evolution of M2 transition properties has been
investigated within the $^{36-64} \rm Ca$ isotope chain. Conclusion: The main
M2 transitions have rather rich underlying structure and their collectivity
increases with the mass number due to larger number of contributing
particle-hole configurations. Pairing correlations in open shell nuclei have
strong effect, causing the M2 strength reduction and shifting of the centroid
energies to higher values. The analysis of M2 transition strengths indicate
that considerable amount of experimental strength may be missing, mainly due to
limitations to rather restricted energy ranges. The calculated M2 strengths for
Ca isotopes, together with the future experimental data will allow constraining
the quenching of the $g$ factors in nuclear medium.

Instead, the spectropolarimetry paints a picture wherein, at maximum

the optical band by a nearly spherical, optically thick, electron-scattering
photosphere located far away from the black hole. We estimate the radius of the

significantly larger than the tidal radius ($\sim 1\rm\, au$) and the
thermalisation radius ($\sim 30\rm\, au$) where the optical continuum is
formed. A month later, as the fallback rate drops and the scattering
photosphere recedes, the continuum polarization increases, revealing a
moderately aspherical interior. We also see evidence for smaller-scale density
variations in the scattering photosphere, inferred from the scatter of the data
in the Stokes $q-u$ plane. On day $+29$, the H$\alpha$ emission-line peak is
depolarized to $\sim 0.3$ per cent (compared to $\sim 1$ per cent continuum

recent years. It aims to recover a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix from
their sum. This paper proposes a novel nonconvex Robust PCA algorithm, coined
Riemannian CUR (RieCUR), which utilizes the ideas of Riemannian optimization
and robust CUR decompositions. This algorithm has the same computational
complexity as Iterated Robust CUR, which is currently state-of-the-art, but is
more robust to outliers. RieCUR is also able to tolerate a significant amount
of outliers, and is comparable to Accelerated Alternating Projections, which
has high outlier tolerance but worse computational complexity than the proposed
method. Thus, the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on
Robust PCA both in terms of computational complexity and outlier tolerance.

observations of CO(2-1) emission from the circumnuclear disks in two early-type

near the galaxy centers are ${\sim}300\,\mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$ in NGC 1380 and
${\sim}500\,\mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$ in NGC 6861. We fit thin disk dynamical
models to the ALMA data cubes to constrain the masses of the central black
holes (BHs). We created host galaxy models using Hubble Space Telescope images
for the extended stellar mass distributions and incorporated a range of
plausible central dust extinction values. For NGC 1380, our best-fit model
yields $M_{\mathrm{BH}} = 1.47 \times 10^8\,M_{\odot}$ with a ${\sim}40\%$
uncertainty. For NGC 6861, the lack of dynamical tracers within the BH's sphere
of influence due to a central hole in the gas distribution precludes a precise
measurement of $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$. However, our model fits require a value for
$M_{\mathrm{BH}}$ in the range of $(1-3) \times 10^9\,M_{\odot}$ in NGC 6861 to
reproduce the observations. The BH masses are generally consistent with
predictions from local BH-host galaxy scaling relations. Systematic
uncertainties associated with dust extinction of the host galaxy light and
choice of host galaxy mass model dominate the error budget of both
measurements. Despite these limitations, the measurements demonstrate ALMA's
ability to provide constraints on BH masses in cases where the BH's projected
radius of influence is marginally resolved or the gas distribution has a
central hole.

In this paper we take a step back from performance-focused multiagent learning,

model-agnostic method for discovery of behavior clusters in multiagent domains,
using variational inference to learn a hierarchy of behaviors at the joint and
local agent levels. Our framework makes no assumption about agents' underlying
learning algorithms, does not require access to their latent states or

the effectiveness of our method for enabling the coupled understanding of
behaviors at the joint and local agent level, detection of behavior
changepoints throughout training, discovery of core behavioral concepts,
demonstrate the approach's scalability to a high-dimensional multiagent MuJoCo

matrices are closed under the Hadamard product and matrix scaling. These
properties help to alleviate two key difficulties for reducing the complexity
of the Inexact Proximal point method (IPOT), and allow us to significantly
reduce the number of iterations to $O(N)$. This yields the Fast Sinkhorn II
(FS-2) algorithm for accurate computation of optimal transport with low
algorithm complexity and fast convergence. Numerical experiments are presented
to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

aircraft inertial reference unit measurements is adopted as equivalent inputs,
which is scalable to different aircraft/flight cases. Data associated with 6
different aircraft/flight conditions are collected to provide diversity
(scalability) in the training/testing database. Then Augmented Imagefication is
proposed for the DNN-based prediction of flying conditions. The raw data are
reshaped as a grayscale image for convolutional operation, and the necessity of
augmentation is analyzed and pointed out. Different kinds of augmented method,
i.e. Flip, Repeat, Tile and their combinations are discussed, the result shows
that the All Repeat operation in both axes of image matrix leads to the best
performance of DNN. The interpretability of DNN is studied based on Grad-CAM,
which provide a better understanding and further solidifies the robustness of
DNN. Next the DNN model, VGG-16 with augmented imagefication data is optimized
for mobile hardware deployment. After pruning of DNN, a lightweight model
(98.79% smaller than original VGG-16) with high accuracy (slightly up by 0.27%)
and fast speed (time delay is reduced by 87.54%) is obtained. And the
hyperparameters optimization of DNN based on TPE is implemented and the best
combination of hyperparameters is determined (learning rate 0.001, iterative
epochs 600, and batch size 100 yields the highest accuracy at 0.987). Finally,
a online FD deployment based on edge device, Jetson Nano, is developed and the
real time monitoring of aircraft is achieved. We believe that this method is
instructive for addressing the FD problems in other similar fields.

feedback mechanism to simulate adaptive training data via a noise extractor and
a retrieval model. The noise extractor estimates the target noise from the
noisy speech, called pseudo-noise. The noise retrieval model retrieves relevant
noise samples from a pool of noise signals according to the noisy speech,
called relevant-cohort. The pseudo-noise and the relevant-cohort set are
jointly sampled and mixed with the source speech corpus to prepare simulated
training data for noise adaptation. Experimental results show that NASTAR can
effectively use one noisy speech sample to adapt an SE model to a target
condition. Moreover, both the noise extractor and the noise retrieval model
contribute to model adaptation. To our best knowledge, NASTAR is the first work

test their performance against LeNet-5, which is an end-to-end optimized neural

per image class goes from the extremely weak supervision condition (i.e., 1
labeled sample per class) to the strong supervision condition (i.e., 4096
labeled sample per class) with gradual transition in between (i.e., $2^n$,

clustering beyond divacancies and very few slightly larger vacancy clusters,
and without interstitial clusters, unlike what happens in bulk at the same PKA

radiation-induced damage and, therefore, the final number of defects in the Fe
core is significantly lower than in the Fe NP. In addition, the Cu shell
substantially diminishes the number of sputtered Fe atoms, acting as a barrier
for recoil ejection. Structurally, the Cu shell responds to the stress
generated by the collision cascade by creating and destroying stacking faults
across the shell width, which could also accommodate further irradiation
defects. Sputtering yield (Y) is underestimated by BCA, which is also expected

this method has been limited to a select number of examples and required

two orders of magnitude improvement on GPU hardware. We also find that it

lesion synthesis network is a modified generative adversarial network (GAN).
Specifically, we innovated a partial convolution strategy to construct an
Unet-like generator. The discriminator is designed using Wasserstein GAN with
gradient penalty and spectral normalization. A mask generation method based on
principal component analysis was developed to model various lesion shapes. The
generated masks are then converted into liver lesions through a lesion
synthesis network. The lesion synthesis framework was evaluated for lesion
textures, and the synthetic lesions were used to train a lesion segmentation
network to further validate the effectiveness of this framework. All the
networks are trained and tested on the public dataset from LITS. The synthetic
lesions generated by the proposed approach have very similar histogram

formation of strong wave localizations not only on the water surface, but also
in a variety of nonlinear dispersive media. Such dynamics is initiated from the
injection of side-bands, which translate into an amplitude modulation of the
wave field. The nonlinear stage of unstable wave evolution can be described by
exact solutions of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE). In that case,
the amplitude modulation of such coherent extreme wave structures is connected
to a particular phase-shift seed in the carrier wave. In this letter, we show
that phase-shifts localization applied to the background, excluding any

waves can be for instance generated by considering the parametrization of
fundamental breathers and thus, by seeding only the local phase-shift
information to the regular carrier wave. Our wave tank experiments show an
excellent agreement with the expected NLSE hydrodynamics and confirm that even

in recommendation systems or in uncovering the interpretation of anatomical
data in images. Most existing methods learn such similarities in the embedding
space over image sets using a single metric learner. Images, however, have a
variety of object attributes such as color, shape, or artifacts. Encoding such
attributes using a single metric learner is inadequate and may fail to
generalize. Instead, multiple learners could focus on separate aspects of these
attributes in subspaces of an overarching embedding. This, however, implies the
number of learners to be found empirically for each new dataset. This work,
Dynamic Subspace Learners, proposes to dynamically exploit multiple learners by
removing the need of knowing apriori the number of learners and aggregating new
subspace learners during training. Furthermore, the visual interpretability of
such subspace learning is enforced by integrating an attention module into our
method. This integrated attention mechanism provides a visual insight of
discriminative image features that contribute to the clustering of image sets
and a visual explanation of the embedding features. The benefits of our
attention-based dynamic subspace learners are evaluated in the application of
image clustering, image retrieval, and weakly supervised segmentation. Our
method achieves competitive results with the performances of multiple learners
baselines and significantly outperforms the classification network in terms of
clustering and retrieval scores on three different public benchmark datasets.
Moreover, our attention maps offer a proxy-labels, which improves the
segmentation accuracy up to 15% in Dice scores when compared to
state-of-the-art interpretation techniques.

all-atom simulations has long remained a challenge, necessitating the use of
models wherein the effect of the solvent is captured without explicit account
of solvent degrees of freedom. This situation has changed with developments in
the molecular quasi-chemical theory (QCT), an approach that enables calculation
of the hydration free energy of macromolecules within all-atom simulations at
the same resolution as is possible for small molecule solutes. The theory also
provides a rigorous and physically transparent framework to conceptualize and
model interactions in molecular solutions, and thus provides a convenient
framework to investigate the assumptions in implicit-solvent models. In this
study, we compare the results using molecular QCT versus predictions from EEF1,
ABSINTH, and GB/SA implicit-solvent models for poly-glycine and poly-alanine
solutes covering a range of chain lengths and conformations. Among the three
models, GB/SA does best in capturing the broad trends in hydration free energy.
We trace the deficiencies of the group-additive EEF1 and ABSINTH models to
their under-appreciation of the cooperativity of hydration between solute
groups; seen in this light, the better performance of GB/SA can be attributed
to its treatment of the collective properties of hydration, albeit within a
continuum dielectric framework. We highlight the importance of validating the
individual physical components that enter implicit solvent models for protein
solution thermodynamics.

analyse the dependence of the QNMs on the deformation parameters of GUP as well

dependency on these parameters. For a better idea of the accuracy of
calculations of QNMs, we compare the results of the QNMs obtained via Mashhoon

methods of QNM calculations is seen depending on the different factors.
Further, we study the thermodynamic properties of the GUP-corrected
Schwarzschild black hole and check for any dependence with the deformation

Hawking temperature, heat capacity and entropy for the black hole and analyse
the results graphically to show the dependency of the thermodynamic properties
on the said parameters. We have seen that the thermodynamic properties of black
holes also depend noticeably on the model parameters in most cases. Black hole
remnants have been studied and it is shown that the possible existence of
remnant radius as well as remnant temperature depends on the deformations
introduced. However, it is observed that the GUP-corrected black hole
constructed here can not become a remnant.

localize temporal boundaries of action instances with specific classes in long

argue that the generated proposals contain rich contextual information, which
may benefits detection confidence prediction. To this end, our method mainly
consists of the following three steps: 1) action classification and feature
extraction by Slowfast, CSN, TimeSformer, TSP, I3D-flow, VGGish-audio, TPN and
ViViT; 2) proposal generation. Our proposed Context-aware Proposal Network
(CPN) builds on top of BMN, GTAD and PRN to aggregate contextual information by
randomly masking some proposal features. 3) action detection. The final
detection prediction is calculated by assigning the proposals with
corresponding video-level classifcation results. Finally, we ensemble the
results under different feature combination settings and achieve 45.8%

commonly used statistics take into account the strengths of the opponents a
player faces. One of the main reasons for this is the conventional belief that
a player's luck tends to even out over the course of a season. The other main
reason is the difficulties of finding a sensible algorithm to both quantify the
strengths of the opponents and incorporate such quantifications into a
renormalization of a player's statistics.
  In this paper, we first argue that certain statistics, such as Earned Run
Average (ERA) or Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) can be significantly
skewed by opponents' strengths in the MLB. We then present an algorithm to
renormalize such statistics, using FIP as the main example. This is achieved by
observing that certain opponent statistics for all 30 teams in the MLB (e.g.
the collection of each game's opponent FIP value over the course of a season)
follow a universal distribution, up to scaling and shift.
  This enables us to establish a data set for a hypothetical average team and
to develop a pitching statistic based on FIP which accounts for the strength of
a pitcher's schedule through methods based on equipercentile equating. It is
called aFIP, which measures what a pitcher's FIP would have been if he had
faced a league-average offensive team every time he pitched.
  We find that there is a significant difference between aFIP and FIP for some
pitchers during the 2019 season and other seasons as well, adding a new tool
for player evaluation. This could make millions of dollars of difference in
player contracts and in profits for teams as they enhance the accuracy with
which they make player acquisitions. The universal distribution we observed
also has many possible future applications throughout the sports world.

illustrates computational challenges with applications to a wide range of
domains including remote sensing, surveillance, smart agriculture, robotics,
autonomous driving, and smart cities. We consider the active explanation-driven
understanding and classification of scenes. Suppose that an agent utilizing one
or more sensors is placed in an unknown environment, and based on its sensory
input, the agent needs to assign some label to the perceived scene. The agent
can adjust its sensor(s) to capture additional details about the scene, but
there is a cost associated with sensor manipulation, and as such, it is
important for the agent to understand the scene in a fast and efficient manner.
It is also important that the agent understand not only the global state of a
scene (e.g., the category of the scene or the major events taking place in the
scene) but also the characteristics/properties of the scene that support
decisions and predictions made about the global state of the scene. Finally,
when the agent encounters an unknown scene category, it must be capable of
refusing to assign a label to the scene, requesting aid from a human, and
updating its underlying knowledge base and machine learning models based on
feedback provided by the human. We introduce a dynamic data driven framework
for the active explanation-driven classification of scenes. Our framework is
entitled ACUMEN: Active Classification and Understanding Method by
Explanation-driven Networks. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed ACUMEN
approach and show how it can be adapted to a domain-specific application, we
focus on an example case study involving the classification of indoor scenes
using an active robotic agent with vision-based sensors, i.e., an

  arXiv:2004.07141",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimation-of-distribution algorithms (EDAs) are optimization algorithms that
learn a distribution on the search space from which good solutions can be
sampled easily. A key parameter of most EDAs is the sample size (population
size). If the population size is too small, the update of the probabilistic
model builds on few samples, leading to the undesired effect of genetic drift.
Too large population sizes avoid genetic drift, but slow down the process.
  Building on a recent quantitative analysis of how the population size leads
to genetic drift, we design a smart-restart mechanism for EDAs. By stopping
runs when the risk for genetic drift is high, it automatically runs the EDA in
good parameter regimes.
  Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we prove a general performance guarantee
for this smart-restart scheme. This in particular shows that in many situations
where the optimal (problem-specific) parameter values are known, the restart
scheme automatically finds these, leading to the asymptotically optimal
performance.
  We also conduct an extensive experimental analysis. On four classic benchmark
problems, we clearly observe the critical influence of the population size on
the performance, and we find that the smart-restart scheme leads to a
performance close to the one obtainable with optimal parameter values. Our
results also show that previous theory-based suggestions for the optimal
population size can be far from the optimal ones, leading to a performance
clearly inferior to the one obtained via the smart-restart scheme. We also
conduct experiments with PBIL (cross-entropy algorithm) on two combinatorial
optimization problems from the literature, the max-cut problem and the
bipartition problem. Again, we observe that the smart-restart mechanism finds
much better values for the population size than those suggested in the
literature, leading to a much better performance.

Poynting-Robertson drag causes dust particles from distant reservoirs to slowly

star, planet, and dust particle show that a significant fraction of the dust
may accrete onto massive planets in close orbits. The deceleration of the
supersonic dust in the planet's atmosphere is modeled, including ablation by
thermal evaporation and sputtering. The fraction of the accreted dust mass
deposited as gas-phase atoms is found to be large for close-in orbits and
massive planets. If mass outflow and vertical mixing are sufficiently weak, the
accreted dust produces a constant mixing ratio of atoms and remnant dust grains
below the stopping layer. When vertical mixing is included along with settling,
the solutions interpolate between the mixing ratio due to the meteoric source
above the homopause, and that of the well-mixed deeper atmosphere below the
homopause. The line opacity from atoms and continuum opacity from remnant dust
may be observable in transmission spectra for sufficiently large dust accretion
rates, a grain size distribution tilted toward the blowout size, and
sufficiently weak vertical mixing. If mixing is strong, the meteoric source may
still act to augment heavy elements mixed up from the deep atmosphere as well
as provide nucleation sites for the formation of larger particles. The possible
role of the Lorentz drag force in limiting the flow speeds and mixing
coefficient for pressures $\la 1\, \rm mbar$ is discussed.

methods from hydrodynamics, kinetic theory, and non-equilibrium statistical

critical feature of some kinds of active matter (particularly the biological
ones), namely, the role of purpose, and the naturally attendant concept of the
pursuit of maximum utility, which we believe is the crucial difference between
active and passive matter. Here we introduce a novel game-theoretic framework,
statistical teleodynamics, that accounts for this feature explicitly and show
how it can be integrated with conventional statistical mechanics to develop a
unified theory of arbitrage equilibrium in active and passive matter. We
propose a spectrum of self-actualizing capabilities, going from none to
completely strategic decision-making, and envision the various examples of
active matter systems occupying someplace in this spectrum. We show how
statistical teleodynamics reduces to familiar results in statistical mechanics
in the limit of zero self-actualization. At the other extreme, in an economic
setting, it provides novel insights about the emergence of income distributions
and their fairness in an ideal free-market society. As examples of agents in
between these limits, we show how our theory predicts the behavior of active
Brownian particles, the emergence of ant craters, and phase equilibria in
social segregation dynamics. We suggest that our theory offers a novel systems
theoretic perspective of emergent phenomena that could serve as the starting

possible to leverage data from multiple clients without compromising privacy.
The quality of FL-based ASR could be measured by recognition performance,

independently and identically distributed (non-IID), the performance could
degrade significantly. In this work, we tackle the non-IID issue in FL-based
ASR with personalized FL, which learns personalized models for each client.
Concretely, we propose two types of personalized FL approaches for ASR.
Firstly, we adapt the personalization layer based FL for ASR, which keeps some
layers locally to learn personalization models. Secondly, to reduce the
communication and computation costs, we propose decoupled federated learning
(DecoupleFL). On one hand, DecoupleFL moves the computation burden to the
server, thus decreasing the computation on clients. On the other hand,
DecoupleFL communicates secure high-level features instead of model parameters,
thus reducing communication cost when models are large. Experiments demonstrate
two proposed personalized FL-based ASR approaches could reduce WER by 2.3% -
3.4% compared with FedAvg. Among them, DecoupleFL has only 11.4% communication
and 75% computation cost compared with FedAvg, which is also significantly less

remarkably difficult to synthesise. A key step in graphite formation is the
removal of defects at high temperature ($>$2300~$^{\circ}$C) that allow
graphenic fragments to rearrange into ordered crystallites. We find the
critical defect controlling graphitisation is a screw dislocation that winds
through the layers like a spiral staircase, inhibiting lateral growth of the
graphenic crystallites ($L_a$) and preventing AB stacking of Bernal graphite.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) identifies screws as
interdigitated fringes with narrow focal depth in graphitising polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). Molecular dynamics simulations of parallel graphenic fragments
confirm that screws spontaneously form during heating, with higher annealing
temperature driving screw annihilation and crystallite growth. The time
evolution of graphitisation is tracked via X-ray diffraction (XRD), showing the
growth of $L_a$ and reduction of the interlayer spacing consistent with
molecular dynamics of screw annihilation. This mechanistic insight raises
opportunities to lower the barrier for graphitisation as well as broadening the
range of carbonaceous materials that can turn into graphite, thereby lowering
the cost of synthetic graphite used in lithium-ion batteries, carbon fibre, and
electrodes for smelting.

Dealing with the resulting highly sparse and large-scale binary feature matrix
is notoriously challenging as conventional methods may suffer from a lack of
power in testing and inconsistency in model fitting while machine learning
methods may suffer from the inability of producing interpretable results or
clinically-meaningful risk factors. To improve EHR-based modeling and utilize
the natural hierarchical structure of disease classification, we propose a
tree-guided feature selection and logic aggregation approach for large-scale
regression with rare binary features, in which dimension reduction is achieved
through not only a sparsity pursuit but also an aggregation promoter with the
logic operator of ``or''. We convert the combinatorial problem into a convex
linearly-constrained regularized estimation, which enables scalable computation
with theoretical guarantees. In a suicide risk study with EHR data, our
approach is able to select and aggregate prior mental health diagnoses as
guided by the diagnosis hierarchy of the International Classification of

our strategy improves both prediction and model interpretation. We identify

an image and then separately predict the relationship between the detected
object instances. Such a disjoint approach is prone to predict redundant
relationship tags (i.e., predicate) between the same object pair with similar
semantic meaning, or incorrect ones that have a similar meaning to the ground
truth but are semantically incorrect. To remedy this, we propose to jointly
train a VRD model with visual object features and semantic relationship
features. To this end, we propose VReBERT, a BERT-like transformer model for
Visual Relationship Detection with a multi-stage training strategy to jointly
process visual and semantic features. We show that our simple BERT-like model

complex spatial-temporal correlations in traffic data, by modeling traffic data

process that can bottleneck the carrier relaxation dynamics, thus degrading the
device performance. Here we present the theory of near-field radiative heat
transfer, that occurs when a two-dimensional electron system is coupled via the
non-retarded Coulomb interaction to a three-dimensional bulk that can behave as
a very efficient electronic heat sink. We apply our theory to study the cooling

graphene in proximity to small-gap bulk materials. The ``Coulomb cooling'' we
introduce is alternative to the conventional phonon-mediated cooling, can be

framework recently proposed for learning discriminative and generative
representations for general low-dimensional submanifolds. We prove that the
equilibrium solutions to the game indeed give correct representations. Our
approach unifies classical methods of learning subspaces with modern deep
learning practice, by showing that subspace learning problems may be provably
solved using the modern toolkit of representation learning. In addition, our
work provides the first theoretical justification for the CTRL framework, in
the important case of linear subspaces. We support our theoretical findings
with compelling empirical evidence. We also generalize the sequential game
formulation to more general representation learning problems. Our code,
including methods for easy reproduction of experimental results, is publically

in a distributed setting like federated learning (FL). LDP mechanisms in FL
protect a client's gradient by randomizing it on the client; however, how can
we interpret the privacy level given by the randomization? Moreover, what types
of attacks can we mitigate in practice? To answer these questions, we introduce
an empirical privacy test by measuring the lower bounds of LDP. The privacy
test estimates how an adversary predicts if a reported randomized gradient was
crafted from a raw gradient $g_1$ or $g_2$. We then instantiate six adversaries
in FL under LDP to measure empirical LDP at various attack surfaces, including
a worst-case attack that reaches the theoretical upper bound of LDP. The
empirical privacy test with the adversary instantiations enables us to
interpret LDP more intuitively and discuss relaxation of the privacy parameter
until a particular instantiated attack surfaces. We also demonstrate numerical
observations of the measured privacy in these adversarial settings, and the
worst-case attack is not realistic in FL. In the end, we also discuss the
possible relaxation of privacy levels in FL under LDP.

We propose an unconstrained thermodynamical treatment for Taub-NUT spaces,

its chemical potential \phi_n. The internal energy in this treatment is
M-n\phi_n rather than the mass M. This approach leads to an entropy which is a
quarter of the area of the horizon and all thermodynamic quantities satisfy the
first law, Gibbs-Duhem relation as well as Smarr's relation. We found a general
form of the first law where the quantities depend on an arbitrary parameter.
Demanding that the first law is independent of this arbitrary parameter or
invariant under electric-magnetic duality leads to a unique form which depends
on Misner string electric and magnetic charges. Misner string charges play an
essential role in the first law, without them the first law is not satisfied.

morphology of the density distribution of each component in clusters, we fit an
ellipse to the density contour of each component and derive shape parameters at
different radii. We find that ellipticity of dark matter is better correlated
with that of galaxy mass-weighted number density, rather than with that of
galaxy number density or galaxy velocity dispersion. We thus use the galaxy
mass-weighted number density map as a representative of the galaxy maps. Among
three different density maps from galaxies, gas, and intracluster stars, the
ellipticity of dark matter is best reproduced by that of the galaxy map over
the entire radii. The 'virialized' galaxy clusters show a better correlation of
spatial distribution between dark matter and other components than the

robot in a physics simulator. The model learns to attend over the scene using
knowledge of the goal and the action history, finally decoding the symbolic
action to execute. Crucially, we address generalization to unseen environments
where some known tools are missing, but alternative unseen tools are present.
We show that by augmenting the representation of the environment with
pre-trained embeddings derived from a knowledge-base, the model can generalize
effectively to novel environments. Experimental results show at least
48.8-58.1% absolute improvement over the baselines in predicting successful
symbolic plans for a simulated mobile manipulator in novel environments with
unseen objects. This work takes a step in the direction of enabling robots to
rapidly synthesize robust plans for complex tasks, particularly in novel
settings

use of a Restrained Uncertainty Weight Loss (RUWL) or joint training to
identify the best weights for the loss function. Our best approach on CNN14

its valence and structure transitions up to 160 GPa. We provide compelling
evidence for a valence transition around 80 GPa, which coincides with a
structural transition from a monoclinic (C2/c) to an orthorhombic phase (Pnma).
We show that the valence transition occurs when the pressure-dependent energy

photography, tone mapping operators (TMOs) for dynamic range compression are
practically demanding. In this paper, we develop a two-stage neural
network-based TMO that is self-calibrated and perceptually optimized. In Stage
one, motivated by the physiology of the early stages of the human visual
system, we first decompose an HDR image into a normalized Laplacian pyramid. We
then use two lightweight deep neural networks (DNNs), taking the normalized
representation as input and estimating the Laplacian pyramid of the
corresponding LDR image. We optimize the tone mapping network by minimizing the
normalized Laplacian pyramid distance (NLPD), a perceptual metric aligning with
human judgments of tone-mapped image quality. In Stage two, the input HDR image
is self-calibrated to compute the final LDR image. We feed the same HDR image
but rescaled with different maximum luminances to the learned tone mapping
network, and generate a pseudo-multi-exposure image stack with different detail
visibility and color saturation. We then train another lightweight DNN to fuse
the LDR image stack into a desired LDR image by maximizing a variant of the
structural similarity index for multi-exposure image fusion (MEF-SSIM), which
has been proven perceptually relevant to fused image quality. The proposed
self-calibration mechanism through MEF enables our TMO to accept uncalibrated
HDR images, while being physiology-driven. Extensive experiments show that our
method produces images with consistently better visual quality. Additionally,
since our method builds upon three lightweight DNNs, it is among the fastest
local TMOs.

To address the challenge, we propose a deep compatible learning (DCL)
framework, which trains a single multi-label segmentation network using images
with only partial structures annotated. We first formulate the
partially-supervised segmentation as an optimization problem compatible with
missing labels, and prove its compatibility. Then, we equip the model with a
conditional segmentation strategy, to propagate labels from multiple
partially-annotated images to the target. Additionally, we propose a dual
learning strategy, which learns two opposite mappings of label propagation
simultaneously, to provide substantial supervision for unlabeled structures.
The two strategies are formulated into compatible forms, termed as conditional
compatibility and dual compatibility, respectively. We show this framework is
generally applicable for conventional loss functions. The approach attains
significant performance improvement over existing methods, especially in the
situation where only a small training dataset is available. Results on three
segmentation tasks have shown that the proposed framework could achieve

leads to a much higher complexity than necessary, since the empirical means of
different arms in $S$ are independent. To deal with this challenge, we explore
the idea of Thompson Sampling (TS) that uses independent random samples instead
of the upper confidence bounds, and design the first TS-based algorithm
TS-Explore for (combinatorial) pure exploration. In TS-Explore, the sum of
independent random samples within arm set $S$ will not exceed the tight upper

and is zero when a player shares the same color with someone in the
neighborhood. The equilibrium is reached when nobody has incentives to continue
choosing a different color. Applications of NCG include resource allocation
\cite{Bampas:2013}, timetable scheduling \cite{Seo:2016}, etc., thus numerous
literature devoted in estimating the convergence situation and optimizing
social payoffs. In this work, we adopted some Markov Chain techniques to
further research on NCG. Firstly, with no less than $\Delta + 2$ colors
provided, we proposed and proved that the converging time is stochastically
bounded by $O_p(\log n)$, through introducing an absorbing Markov Chain to
approximate upper bounds for its expectation and variance, which is an
improvement on Chaudhuri et al.'s result \cite{Chaudhuri:2008}. Here $n$ is the
number of vertices and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the network. Secondly,
as most literature ignores the dynamics after the conflict is solved, we
focused on post-conflict adjustments among the players when a Borda preference
mechanism is applied. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods like
Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm and Simulated Annealing Heuristic were employed to
simulate payoff-optimizing behaviors and estimate both local and global optimal
social welfare. Supporting experimental results were given to illustrate the

of mutual magnetic interaction initially from the photosphere to the corona via
the abrupt rapid shearing motion of a small sunspot before the flare, and then
suddenly from the corona back to the photosphere via the sudden retraction
motion of the same sunspot during the flare impulsive phase. About 10 hours
before the flare, a small sunspot in the active region NOAA 11818 started to
move northeast along a magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), creating a
shearing motion that changed the quasi-static state of the active region. A
filament right above the PIL was activated following the movement of the
sunspot and then got partially erupted. The eruption eventually led to the M3.3
flare. The sunspot was then suddenly pulled back to the opposite direction upon
the flare onset. During the backward motion, the Lorentz force underwent a
simultaneous impulsive change both in magnitude and direction. Its directional
change is found to be conformable with the retraction motion. The observation
provides direct evidence for the role of the shearing motion of the sunspot in
powering and triggering the flare. It especially confirms that the abrupt
motion of a sunspot during a solar flare is the result of a back reaction
caused by the reconfiguration of the coronal magnetic field.

\emph{sequential adversarial team games}, where a team of players faces another
team in a zero-sum game. It is known that team members' asymmetric information
makes both equilibrium computation \textsf{APX}-hard and team's strategies not
directly representable on the game tree. This latter issue prevents the
adoption of successful tools for huge 2-player zero-sum games such as,
\emph{e.g.}, abstractions, no-regret learning, and subgame solving. This work
shows that we can recover from this weakness by bridging the gap between
sequential adversarial team games and 2-player games. In particular, we propose
a new, suitable game representation that we call
\emph{team-public-information}, in which a team is represented as a single
coordinator who only knows information common to the whole team and prescribes
to each member an action for any possible private state. The resulting
representation is highly \emph{explainable}, being a 2-player tree in which the
team's strategies are behavioral with a direct interpretation and more
expressive than the original extensive form when designing abstractions.
Furthermore, we prove payoff equivalence of our representation, and we provide
techniques that, starting directly from the extensive form, generate
dramatically more compact representations without information loss. Finally, we
experimentally evaluate our techniques when applied to a standard testbed,
comparing their performance with the current state of the art.

attention in both academia and industry. However, two key challenges seriously
hinder the further research of GraphNAS. First, since there is no consensus for

are often not comparable and even not reproducible, leading to unfair
comparisons. Secondly, GraphNAS often needs extensive computations, which makes
it highly inefficient and inaccessible to researchers without access to
large-scale computation. To solve these challenges, we propose NAS-Bench-Graph,
a tailored benchmark that supports unified, reproducible, and efficient
evaluations for GraphNAS. Specifically, we construct a unified, expressive yet
compact search space, covering 26,206 unique graph neural network (GNN)
architectures and propose a principled evaluation protocol. To avoid
unnecessary repetitive training, we have trained and evaluated all of these
architectures on nine representative graph datasets, recording detailed metrics
including train, validation, and test performance in each epoch, the latency,
the number of parameters, etc. Based on our proposed benchmark, the performance
of GNN architectures can be directly obtained by a look-up table without any
further computation, which enables fair, fully reproducible, and efficient
comparisons. To demonstrate its usage, we make in-depth analyses of our
proposed NAS-Bench-Graph, revealing several interesting findings for GraphNAS.
We also showcase how the benchmark can be easily compatible with GraphNAS open

Based on the model with radiative cooling and heating, the ionization

compared to the observed ultrafast outflows (UFOs). We find that in our

assumption of a scalar form factor of dipole form, the value of the proton mass
radius is calculated as $0.85\pm 0.06 \text{ fm }$ by fitting the differential
cross section of the $\gamma p \rightarrow \rho^0 p$ reaction at near-threshold
energy. For light vector meson photoproduction, because the exchange of a
scalar quark--antiquark pair is not suppressed and should dominate the scalar
gluon exchange, the radius we extract from $\rho^0$ photoproduction is likely
to represent the quark radius of the proton. This fact may explain why the
value obtained in this work is very near the proton charge radius. Moreover,
the absolute value of the $\rho^0$--proton scattering length $|\alpha_{\rho^0
p}|= 0.31 \pm 0.06 \text{ fm}$ is obtained for the first time within the vector
meson dominance model. This result disobeys the rule that the absolute value of
the vector meson and proton scattering length $|\alpha_{V p}|$ increases with
the meson's mass, which can be attributed to treating the $\rho^0$ meson as a
point in the analysis. These results provide useful theoretical information for

Before the stars arrive on
the zero-age main sequence, they form in the collapses of molecular clouds,
gain matter through accretion processes, and compress their cores until
hydrogen can burn in full equilibrium. Although this evolutionary phase lasts a
relatively short time, it is the imprint of these important physical processes
that is often ignored by simplified assumptions. While asteroseismology offers
a great tool to investigate these physical processes, studying pre-MS
oscillations in turn has the potential to further advance the field.
Asteroseismology of pre-main sequence stars faces observational and theoretical
challenges. The remnants of their birth environment which is often still
surrounding the young stars causes variability that can interfere with the
signal of pulsations. The lack of long time-base satellite observations in
addition limits the applications of the method. Theoretical models of pre-main
sequence stars include several assumptions and simplifications that influence
the calculation of pulsation frequencies and excitation properties of pulsation
modes. Keeping all this in mind, the prospects for pre-main sequence
asteroseismology are manifold. An improved understanding of the structure of
young stellar objects has the potential to answer some of the open questions of
stellar evolution, including angular momentum transport and the formation of
magnetic fields. While gyrochronology, for example, struggles to determine the
ages of the youngest clusters, pulsations in pre-main sequence stars can
function as an independent age indicator yielding higher precision for single
stars. The increasing interest of stellar astrophysics in general to
investigate the formation and early evolution of stars and planets illustrates
the growing importance of pre-main sequence asteroseismology.

phase and amplitude response inference from observations using test

remains a challenging problem. Even more challenging is the inference of the
amplitude response. This characteristic is crucial, e.g., for controlling the
amplitude of the collective mode in a network of interacting units -- a task
relevant to neuroscience. Here, we compare the performance of different
techniques suitable for inferring the phase and amplitude response,
particularly with application to macroscopic oscillators. We suggest
improvements to these techniques, e.g., demonstrating how to obtain the PRC in
case of stimuli of arbitrary shape. Our main result is a novel technique

of molecular clouds (MCs) appear to be unbound, dominated by turbulent motions.
However, these estimations are made typically via the so-called viral parameter
$\alpha_{\rm vir}^{\rm class}$, which is an observational proxy to the virial
ratio between the kinetic and the gravitational energy. This parameter
intrinsically assumes that MCs are isolated, spherical, and with constant
density. However, MCs are embedded in their parent galaxy and thus are subject
to compressive and disruptive tidal forces from their galaxy, exhibit irregular
shapes, and show substantial substructure. We, therefore, compare the typical
estimations of $\alpha_{\rm vir}^{\rm class}$ to a more precise definition of
the virial parameter, $\alpha_{\rm vir}^{\rm full}$, which accounts not only
for the self-gravity (as $\alpha_{\rm vir}^{\rm class}$), but also for the
tidal stresses, and thus, it can take negative (self-gravity) and positive
(tides) values. While we recover the classical result that most of the clouds
appear to be unbound, having $\alpha_{\rm vir}^{\rm class} > 2$, we show that,
with the more detailed definition considering the full gravitational energy,
(i) 50\%\ of the total population is gravitationally bound, however, (ii)
another 20\%\ is gravitationally dominated, but with tides tearing them apart;
(iii) the source of those tides does not come from the galactic structure
(bulge, halo, spiral arms), but from the molecular cloud complexes in which
clouds reside, and probably (iv) from massive young stellar complexes, if they
were present. (v) Finally, our results also suggest that, interstellar
turbulence can have, at least partially, a gravitational origin.

$\textit{gender artifact}$ as a visual cue that is correlated with gender,
focusing specifically on those cues that are learnable by a modern image
classifier and have an interpretable human corollary. Through our analyses, we
find that gender artifacts are ubiquitous in the COCO and OpenImages datasets,
occurring everywhere from low-level information (e.g., the mean value of the
color channels) to the higher-level composition of the image (e.g., pose and
location of people). Given the prevalence of gender artifacts, we claim that
attempts to remove gender artifacts from such datasets are largely infeasible.
Instead, the responsibility lies with researchers and practitioners to be aware
that the distribution of images within datasets is highly gendered and hence
develop methods which are robust to these distributional shifts across groups.

$U$-statistics, with a computational cost that interpolates between linear time
in the number of samples, and quadratic time, as associated with classical
$U$-statistic tests. The three proposed tests aggregate over several kernel
bandwidths to detect departures from the null on various scales: we call the
resulting tests MMDAggInc, HSICAggInc and KSDAggInc. This procedure provides a
solution to the fundamental kernel selection problem as we can aggregate a
large number of kernels with several bandwidths without incurring a significant
loss of test power. For the test thresholds, we derive a quantile bound for
wild bootstrapped incomplete $U$-statistics, which is of independent interest.
We derive non-asymptotic uniform separation rates for MMDAggInc and HSICAggInc,
and quantify exactly the trade-off between computational efficiency and the
attainable rates: this result is novel for tests based on incomplete
$U$-statistics, to our knowledge. We further show that in the quadratic-time
case, the wild bootstrap incurs no penalty to test power over the more
widespread permutation-based approach, since both attain the same minimax
optimal rates (which in turn match the rates that use oracle quantiles). We
support our claims with numerical experiments on the trade-off between
computational efficiency and test power. In all three testing frameworks, the
linear-time versions of our proposed tests perform at least as well as the

fundus cameras will enable CVD risk estimation in various scenarios and improve
healthcare democratization. However, there are still significant issues to be
solved. One of the top priority issues is the different camera differences
between the databases for research material and the samples in the production
environment. Most high-quality retinography databases ready for research are
collected from high-end fundus cameras, and there is a significant domain
discrepancy between different cameras. To fully explore the domain discrepancy
issue, we first collect a Fundus Camera Paired (FCP) dataset containing
pair-wise fundus images captured by the high-end Topcon retinal camera and the
low-end Mediwork portable fundus camera of the same patients. Then, we propose
a cross-laterality feature alignment pre-training scheme and a self-attention
camera adaptor module to improve the model robustness. The cross-laterality
feature alignment training encourages the model to learn common knowledge from
the same patient's left and right fundus images and improve model
generalization. Meanwhile, the device adaptation module learns feature
transformation from the target domain to the source domain. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on both the UK Biobank database and our FCP data. The
experimental results show that the CVD risk regression accuracy and the result
consistency over two cameras are improved with our proposed method. The code is

result: children, even very young toddlers, demonstrate learning and thinking
in a strikingly similar manner to scientific reasoning in formal research.
Encountering a novel phenomenon, children make hypotheses against data, conduct
causal inference from observation, test their theory via experimentation, and
correct the proposition if inconsistency arises. Rounds of such processes
continue until the underlying mechanism is found. Towards building machines
that can learn and think like people, one natural question for us to ask is:
whether the intelligence we achieve today manages to perform such a scientific
thinking process, and if any, at what level. In this work, we devise the EST
environment for evaluating the scientific thinking ability in artificial
agents. Motivated by the stream of research on causal discovery, we build our
interactive EST environment based on Blicket detection. Specifically, in each
episode of EST, an agent is presented with novel observations and asked to
figure out all objects' Blicketness. At each time step, the agent proposes new
experiments to validate its hypothesis and updates its current belief. By
evaluating Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents on both a symbolic and visual
version of this task, we notice clear failure of today's learning methods in
reaching a level of intelligence comparable to humans. Such inefficacy of
learning in scientific thinking calls for future research in building humanlike
intelligence.

both verifying the effectiveness of approximate many-body theory and predicting

et al have proposed a Fermi-polaron scheme with a lossy impurity [54], which
exhibits a novel long-lived attractive polaron branch in the quantum Zeno
limit. However, we would also run into a counterpart problem that an impurity
scatters with an open quantum bath exciting polarons, which is what we focus in
on. In this work, we conclude the molecular state under the two limits of
vanishing small and infinite large dissipation intensity as well as the reason
why the dissipation range leads to the decrease of the gap between the
molecular state and molecule-hole continuum in the former case by means of
analytically research. The spectrum functions of molecular and polaron states
with different dissipation range and loss rate are investigated. We find the
spectral signals of molecular and polaron states will both diffuse firstly and
then revives as the dissipation is on the raise. Moreover, it is shown that the
attractive and repulsive polarons show different response to the increasing
dissipation range in our model. At last, we exhibit the polaron energy,
residue, effective mass and two-body decay for mass balanced and imbalanced
systems. Our results might be useful for future cold atom experiment on open

propagation, is an important yet extremely challenging task. Existing source
localization models typically are heavily dependent on the hand-crafted rules.
Unfortunately, a large portion of the graph diffusion process for many
applications is still unknown to human beings so it is important to have
expressive models for learning such underlying rules automatically. This paper
aims to establish a generic framework of invertible graph diffusion models for
source localization on graphs, namely Invertible Validity-aware Graph Diffusion
(IVGD), to handle major challenges including 1) Difficulty to leverage
knowledge in graph diffusion models for modeling their inverse processes in an
end-to-end fashion, 2) Difficulty to ensure the validity of the inferred
sources, and 3) Efficiency and scalability in source inference. Specifically,
first, to inversely infer sources of graph diffusion, we propose a graph
residual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible with
theoretical guarantees; second, we develop a novel error compensation mechanism
that learns to offset the errors of the inferred sources. Finally, to ensure
the validity of the inferred sources, a new set of validity-aware layers have
been devised to project inferred sources to feasible regions by flexibly
encoding constraints with unrolled optimization techniques. A linearization
technique is proposed to strengthen the efficiency of our proposed layers. The
convergence of the proposed IVGD is proven theoretically. Extensive experiments
on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed IVGD outperforms
state-of-the-art comparison methods significantly. We have released our code at

predicts a correspondence between weight and perverse filtrations in the
context of mirror symmetry. In this paper, we offer to reexamine this
conjecture through the lens of mirror symmetry for a Fano pair $(X,D)$ where
$X$ is a smooth Fano variety, and $D$ is a simple normal crossing divisor. A
mirror object is a multi-potential version of the Landau-Ginzburg (LG) model,
called hybrid LG model, which encodes the mirrors of all irreducible components
of $D$. We explain how the mirror P=W conjecture is induced by the relative
version of homological mirror symmetry for such pairs. The key idea is to find
a combinatorial description of the perverse filtration. The requisite
combinatorics naturally appears in the course of studying Hodge numbers of
hybrid LG models. We discuss this topic in the second half of the paper and use
it to extend the work of Katzarkov-Kontsevich-Pantev to the hybrid LG setting.
In application, we discover an interesting upper bound of the multiplicativity

properties that exhibits a chiral phase transition and that includes
strangeness through hyperonic degrees of freedom. Empirical constraints from
nuclear matter alone allow for various scenarios, from a strong first-order
chiral transition at relatively low densities through a weaker transition at
higher densities, even up to a smooth crossover not far beyond the edge of the
allowed range. The model parameters can be chosen such that at asymptotically
large densities the chirally restored phase contains strangeness and the speed
of sound approaches the conformal limit, resulting in a high-density phase that
resembles deconfined quark matter. Additionally, if the model is required to
reproduce sufficiently massive compact stars, the allowed parameter range is
significantly narrowed down, resulting for instance in a very narrow range for
the poorly known slope parameter of the symmetry energy, $L\simeq (88-92)\,
{\rm MeV}$. We also find that for the allowed parameter range strangeness does
not appear in the form of hyperons in the chirally broken phase and the chiral
transition is of first order. Due to its unified approach and relative
simplicity - here we restrict ourselves to zero temperature and the mean-field
approximation - the model can be used in the future to study dense matter under
compact star conditions in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition, for
instance to compute the surface tension or to investigate spatially

semantic result is then inversely re-mapped to 3D face data, which finally
achieves the 3D face parsing. Experimental results show that both CPFNet and

constrained and thus leading to very low random sampling efficiency. In this
work we tackled this challenge using Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning search algorithms used for Black-Box optimisation problems. Using the
cMSSM and the pMSSM parameter spaces, we consider both the Higgs mass and the
Dark Matter Relic Density constraints to study their sampling efficiency and
parameter space coverage. We find our methodology to produce orders of
magnitude improvement of sampling efficiency whilst reasonably covering the
parameter space.

demand forecasting. Classical methods generally adopt the discrete choice model
(DCM) framework with linear utility functions and high-level route
characteristics. While several recent studies have started to explore the
applicability of deep learning for route choice modeling, they are limited to
path-based models with relatively simple model architectures and relying on
predefined choice sets. Existing link-based models can capture the dynamic
nature of link choices within the trip without the need for choice set
generation, but still assume linear relationships and link-additive features.
To address these issues, this study proposes a general deep inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL) framework for link-based route choice modeling,
which is capable of incorporating diverse features (of the state, action and
trip context) and capturing complex relationships. Specifically, we adapt an
adversarial IRL model to the route choice problem for efficient estimation of
context-dependent reward functions without value iteration. Experiment results
based on taxi GPS data from Shanghai, China validate the superior prediction
performance of the proposed model over conventional DCMs and other imitation
learning baselines, even for destinations unseen in the training data. Further
analysis show that the model exhibits competitive computational efficiency and
reasonable interpretability. The proposed methodology provides a new direction
for future development of route choice models. It is general and can be
adaptable to other route choice problems across different modes and networks.

policies tailored to a particular agent from scratch for every new morphology.
Recent work aims to eliminate the re-training of policies by investigating
whether a morphology-agnostic policy, trained on a diverse set of agents with
similar task objectives, can be transferred to new agents with unseen
morphologies without re-training. This is a challenging problem that required
previous approaches to use hand-designed descriptions of the new agent's
morphology. Instead of hand-designing this description, we propose a
data-driven method that learns a representation of morphology directly from the
reinforcement learning objective. Ours is the first reinforcement learning
algorithm that can train a policy to generalize to new agent morphologies
without requiring a description of the agent's morphology in advance. We
evaluate our approach on the standard benchmark for agent-agnostic control, and
improve over the current state of the art in zero-shot generalization to new
agents. Importantly, our method attains good performance without an explicit
description of morphology.

  the US stock market",,,,,"q-fin.PM q-fin.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, more and more investors use technical analysis methods in
their own trading. Evaluating the effectiveness of technical analysis has
become more feasible due to increasing computing capability and blooming public
data, which indie investors can perform stock analysis and backtest their own
trading strategy conveniently. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
indicator is one of the popular technical indicators that are widely used in
different strategies. In order to verify the MACD effectiveness, in this
thesis, I use the MACD indicator with traditional parameters (12, 26, 9) to
build various trading strategies. Then, I apply these strategies to stocks
listed on three indices in the US stock market (i.e., Dow-Jones, Nasdaq, and
S&P 500) and evaluate its performance in terms of win rate, profitability,
Sharpe ratio, number of trades and maximum drawdown. The backtesting is
programmed using Python, covering the period between 01/01/2015 and 28-08-2021.
The result shows that the win-rate of the strategy with only the MACD indicator
is less than 50%. However, the win-rate is improved for the trading strategies
that combine the MACD indicator with other momentum indicators like the Money
Flow Index (MFI) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Based on this result, I
redesign the MACD mathematical formula by taking the trading volume and daily
price volatility into consideration to derive a new indicator called VPVMA. The
results show that the win-rate and risk-adjust performance of this new trading
strategy have been improved significantly. In general, the findings suggest
that while all the MACD trading strategies mentioned above can generate
positive returns, the performance is not good without using other momentum
indicators. Hence, the VPVMA indicator performs better.

learning has recently attracted attention as a first-line automatic testing
tool because of its high accuracy and low radiation exposure. However, existing
methods rely on supervised learning, imposing an additional burden to doctors
for collecting disease data or annotating spatial labels for network training,
consequently hindering their implementation. We propose a method based on a
deep neural network for computer-aided diagnosis called virtual multi-view
projection and reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection. Presumably,
this is the first method that only requires data from healthy patients for
training to identify three-dimensional (3D) regions containing any anomalies.
The method has three key components. Unlike existing computer-aided diagnosis
tools that use conventional CT slices as the network input, our method 1)
improves the recognition of 3D lung structures by virtually projecting an
extracted 3D lung region to obtain two-dimensional (2D) images from diverse
views to serve as network inputs, 2) accommodates the input diversity gain for
accurate anomaly detection, and 3) achieves 3D anomaly/disease localization
through a novel 3D map restoration method using multiple 2D anomaly maps. The
proposed method based on unsupervised learning improves the patient-level
anomaly detection by 10% (area under the curve, 0.959) compared with a gold
standard based on supervised learning (area under the curve, 0.848), and it
localizes the anomaly region with 93% accuracy, demonstrating its high
performance.

explicitly enforces scene consistency and learns an agent interaction policy

autoencoder (VAE) formalism enables the method to identify and classify rotated

appropriate mean and standard deviation. After training, simulated data
realizations are generated by decoding appropriate latent space points. Since,
however, standard VAE:s trained on randomly rotated MNIST digits cannot
reliably distinguish between different digit classes since the rotated input
data is effectively compared to a similarly rotated output data record. In
contrast, an alternative implementation in which the objective function
compares the output associated with each rotated digit to a corresponding fixed
unreferenced reference digit is shown here to discriminate accurately among the
rotated digits in latent space even when the dimension of the latent space is 2

from the front of the patient, chest digital tomosynthesis (CDTS) imaging can
be more advantageous for lung lesion detection because it acquires multiple
images projected from multiple angles of the patient. Various clinical
comparative analysis and verification studies have been reported to demonstrate
this, but there were no artificial intelligence (AI)-based comparative analysis
studies. Existing AI-based computer-aided detection (CAD) systems for lung
lesion diagnosis have been developed mainly based on CXR images; however,
CAD-based on CDTS, which uses multi-angle images of patients in various
directions, has not been proposed and verified for its usefulness compared to
CXR-based counterparts. This study develops/tests a CDTS-based AI CAD system to
detect lung lesions to demonstrate performance improvements compared to
CXR-based AI CAD. We used multiple projection images as input for the
CDTS-based AI model and a single-projection image as input for the CXR-based AI
model to fairly compare and evaluate the performance between models. The
proposed CDTS-based AI CAD system yielded sensitivities of 0.782 and 0.785 and
accuracies of 0.895 and 0.837 for the performance of detecting tuberculosis and
pneumonia, respectively, against normal subjects. These results show higher
performance than sensitivities of 0.728 and 0.698 and accuracies of 0.874 and
0.826 for detecting tuberculosis and pneumonia through the CXR-based AI CAD,
which only uses a single projection image in the frontal direction. We found
that CDTS-based AI CAD improved the sensitivity of tuberculosis and pneumonia
by 5.4% and 8.7% respectively, compared to CXR-based AI CAD without loss of
accuracy. Therefore, we comparatively prove that CDTS-based AI CAD technology
can improve performance more than CXR, enhancing the clinical applicability of
CDTS.

Defenses using random transformations (RT) have shown impressive results,
particularly BaRT (Raff et al., 2019) on ImageNet. However, this type of
defense has not been rigorously evaluated, leaving its robustness properties
poorly understood. Their stochastic properties make evaluation more challenging
and render many proposed attacks on deterministic models inapplicable. First,
we show that the BPDA attack (Athalye et al., 2018a) used in BaRT's evaluation
is ineffective and likely overestimates its robustness. We then attempt to
construct the strongest possible RT defense through the informed selection of
transformations and Bayesian optimization for tuning their parameters.
Furthermore, we create the strongest possible attack to evaluate our RT
defense. Our new attack vastly outperforms the baseline, reducing the accuracy
by 83% compared to the 19% reduction by the commonly used EoT attack
($4.3\times$ improvement). Our result indicates that the RT defense on the
Imagenette dataset (a ten-class subset of ImageNet) is not robust against
adversarial examples. Extending the study further, we use our new attack to
adversarially train RT defense (called AdvRT), resulting in a large robustness
gain. Code is available at

has been detected. One way to show motion in galaxies is to produce rotation
curves that are plots of velocity measurements of how fast stars and gas move
in a galaxy around the center of mass. According to Newton's Law of
Gravitation, the rotational velocity is an indication of the amount of visible

estimated using photometry, dark matter mass in galaxies can be calculated. In
