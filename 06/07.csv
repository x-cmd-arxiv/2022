Mainly, the Prisoner's Dilemma is a well-known model that has been extensively
studied in complex networks. However, although the emergence of cooperation has
been investigated before, the influence of memory in its evolution is not well
understood. This paper presents a detailed study of cooperation dynamics in
which agents have memory. We simulate the evolutionary Prisoner's dilemma game
on random, scale-free and networks presenting degree-degree correlation.
Through extensive simulations, we show that assortativity can improve
cooperation when the temptation to defect increases. Moreover, we show that the
inclusion of memory decreases the network structure influence. Our results
contribute to understanding the role of the network structure and the player's
memory of cooperation.

  with Large Batches",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stochastic variance reduction has proven effective at accelerating
first-order algorithms for solving convex finite-sum optimization tasks such as
empirical risk minimization. Incorporating additional second-order information
has proven helpful in further improving the performance of these first-order
methods. However, comparatively little is known about the benefits of using
variance reduction to accelerate popular stochastic second-order methods such
as Subsampled Newton. To address this, we propose Stochastic Variance-Reduced
Newton (SVRN), a finite-sum minimization algorithm which enjoys all the
benefits of second-order methods: simple unit step size, easily parallelizable
large-batch operations, and fast local convergence, while at the same time
taking advantage of variance reduction to achieve improved convergence rates
(per data pass) for smooth and strongly convex problems. We show that SVRN can
accelerate many stochastic second-order methods (such as Subsampled Newton) as
well as iterative least squares solvers (such as Iterative Hessian Sketch), and
it compares favorably to popular first-order methods with variance reduction.

main idea is to learn small perturbations to perturb normal data and learn a
classifier to classify the normal data and the perturbed data into two
different classes. The perturbator and classifier are jointly learned using
deep neural networks. Importantly, the perturbations should be as small as
possible but the classifier is still able to recognize the perturbed data from
unperturbed data. Therefore, the perturbed data are regarded as abnormal data
and the classifier provides a decision boundary between the normal data and
abnormal data, although the training data do not include any abnormal data.
Compared with the state-of-the-art of anomaly detection, our method does not
require any assumption about the shape (e.g. hypersphere) of the decision
boundary and has fewer hyper-parameters to determine. Empirical studies on
benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

decomposes and reconstructs the radar signal according to the difference in the
reflected echo frequency between the limbs and the trunk of the human body.
Then, the radar is selected according to the difference between the ratio of
echo energy of limbs and trunk and the theoretical value. The time domain,
frequency domain and various entropy features of the selected radar are
extracted. Finally, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) recognition model of the
ReLu core is established. Experiments show that this method can effectively

affect only photons and/or gravitons. In principle, isolated systems comprising
only massive particles could evolve unitarily indefinitely in such models. In
practice, since photons and gravitons are ubiquitous and scatter from massive
particles, dynamical collapses of the former will effectively induce collapses
of the latter. In non-relativistic models in which particle number is conserved
and interactions are modelled by classical potentials, massive systems can be
modelled as collections of elementary massive particles bound by potentials,
interacting with an environment of photons and gravitons. In this picture,
although the photon and/or graviton collapse dynamics effectively localize
massive systems, these collapses take the effective form of approximate
measurements on the environment whose effect on the massive systems is
indirect. We argue that these environmental collapse models, like standard
mass-dependent spontaneous localisation models, may be consistent with quantum
experiments on microscopic systems while predicting very rapid effective
collapse of macroscopic massive systems, and hence a potential solution to the
quantum measurement problem. However, the models considered here have different
experimental signatures from standard mass-dependent spontaneous localisation
models. For example, they predict no deviations from standard quantum
interferometry for mesoscopic systems of massive particles isolated from a
decohering environment, nor do they predict anomalous spontaneous emission of
radiation from isolated matter of the type prediction by standard
mass-dependent spontaneous localization models. New experiments and analyses
are required to obtain empirical bounds on the decoherence rate in our models.

processor (ISP) to render noisy raw sensor images to the final processed
output. Training nightmode ISP networks relies on large-scale datasets of image
pairs with: (1) a noisy raw image captured with a short exposure and a high ISO
gain; and (2) a ground truth low-noise raw image captured with a long exposure
and low ISO that has been rendered through the ISP. Capturing such image pairs
is tedious and time-consuming, requiring careful setup to ensure alignment
between the image pairs. In addition, ground truth images are often prone to
motion blur due to the long exposure. To address this problem, we propose a
method that synthesizes nighttime images from daytime images. Daytime images
are easy to capture, exhibit low-noise (even on smartphone cameras) and rarely
suffer from motion blur. We outline a processing framework to convert daytime
raw images to have the appearance of realistic nighttime raw images with
different levels of noise. Our procedure allows us to easily produce aligned
noisy and clean nighttime image pairs. We show the effectiveness of our

leading to unfair comparisons. In this work, we first revisit TTT assumptions
and categorize TTT protocols by two key factors. Among the multiple protocols,
we adopt a realistic sequential test-time training (sTTT) protocol, under which

stronger test-time feature learning. TTAC discovers clusters in both source and

generalization. Pseudo label filtering and iterative updating are developed to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of anchored clustering. We demonstrate

parameterize the closed form solutions for the states, control and costates.
Analysis of the optimal control reveal that they are constrained to lie on a

regularize the current deep neural networks. Mixup generates virtual samples
and corresponding labels at once through linear interpolation. However, this
one-stage generation paradigm and the use of linear interpolation have the
following two defects: (1) The label of the generated sample is directly
combined from the labels of the original sample pairs without reasonable
judgment, which makes the labels likely to be ambiguous. (2) linear combination
significantly limits the sampling space for generating samples. To tackle these
problems, we propose a novel and effective augmentation method based on global
clustering relationships named \textbf{Global Mixup}. Specifically, we
transform the previous one-stage augmentation process into two-stage,
decoupling the process of generating virtual samples from the labeling. And for
the labels of the generated samples, relabeling is performed based on
clustering by calculating the global relationships of the generated samples. In
addition, we are no longer limited to linear relationships but generate more
reliable virtual samples in a larger sampling space. Extensive experiments for
\textbf{CNN}, \textbf{LSTM}, and \textbf{BERT} on five tasks show that Global
Mixup significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines. Further
experiments also demonstrate the advantage of Global Mixup in low-resource

be applied in quantum technology contexts ranging from quantum computing to
quantum communications. By means of the undo command, indeed, the last
performed operation can be time-reversed so as to perfectly restore a condition
in which an arbitrary new operation, chosen by the external user, can be
applied. Moreover, by further generalizing this concept, the undo command can
also allow for the reversing of a quantum operation in a generic instant of the
past. Here, thanks to optimal time-reversal routines, all these functionalities
are experimentally implemented on the five-fold F=2 Hilbert space of a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of non-interacting $^{87}$Rb atoms in the ground
state, realized with an atom chip. Specifically, each time-reversal
transformation is attained by designing an optimal modulated radio frequency
field, achieving on average an accuracy of around 92% in any performed test.
The experimental results are accompanied by a thermodynamic interpretation
based on the Loschmidt echo. Our findings are expected to promote the
implementation of time-reversal operations in a real scenario of gate-based
quantum computing with a more complex structure than the five-level system here
considered.

different augmented images. However, due to the lack of explicit
regularization, the consistency between different representations is less
satisfactory. Therefore, we constrain the consistency of different

COnsistent REpresentation Learning (CORE). Specifically, we first capture the

by means of integral field spectroscopic observations taken with the MUSE/VLT.
The large FoV of MUSE and its unprecedented sensitivity enable observations of
the galaxy nebular emission up to large galactocentric distances. This allowed
us to trace the ionized gas morphology and ionization structure up to
kiloparsec scales and, for the first time, to accurately investigate the
excitation mechanism operating in the outskirts of a typical BCG. The intensity
and diagnostic maps reveal at least two highly distinct components of ionized
gas: the bright central regions, mostly made of individual clumps, and a faint
component which extends up to kiloparsec scales and consists of widespread
diffuse emission, well-delineated filamentary structures, and faint knots.
Noteworthy are the two curvilinear filaments extending up to 2 and 2.3 kpc
southwest, which likely trace the edges of supergiant expanding bubbles driven
by galactic outflows. We find that while the central clumps in Haro 14 are
HII-region complexes, the morphology and line ratios of the whole
low-surface-brightness component are not compatible with star formation
photoionization. In the spatially resolved emission-line-ratio diagnostic
diagrams, spaxels above the maximum starburst line form the majority. Moreover,
our findings suggest that more than one alternative mechanism is ionizing the
outer galaxy regions. The properties of the diffuse component are consistent
with ionization by diluted radiation and the large filaments and shells are
most probably shocked areas at the edge of bubbles. The mechanism responsible
for the ionization of the faint individual clumps observed in the galaxy
periphery is more difficult to assess. These clumps could be the shocked debris
of fragmented shells or regions where star formation is proceeding under
extreme conditions.

precise probe of physical processes active both in the early universe (such as
those connected to particle decays and inflation) and at later times (e.g.
reionization and astrophysical emissions). Limited progress has been made in
the characterization of these spectral distortions after the pioneering
measurements of the FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite in the early 1990s,
which mainly targeted the measurement of their average amplitude across the
sky. Since at present no follow-up mission is scheduled to update the FIRAS
measurement, in this work we re-analyze the FIRAS data and produce a map of
$\mu$-type spectral distortion across the sky. We provide an updated constraint
on the $\mu$ distortion monopole $|\langle\mu\rangle|<47\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\%
confidence level that sharpens the previous FIRAS estimate by a factor of $\sim
2$. We also constrain primordial non-Gaussianities of curvature perturbations
on scales $10\lesssim k\lesssim 5\times 10^4$ through the cross-correlation of
$\mu$ distortion anisotropies with CMB temperature and, for the first time, the

communications compared to optical fiber terrestrial networks (OFTNs). The
crossover function enables to calculate the crossover distance for an OWSN and
an OFTN. If the distance between two points on Earth is greater than the
crossover distance, then switching or crossing over from the OFTN to the OWSN
results in lower latency for data communications between these points. In this
work, we extend the previously proposed crossover function for a scenario such
that intermediate satellites (or hops) are incorporated between ingress and
egress satellites in the OWSN for a more realistic calculation of the crossover
distance in this scenario. We consider different OWSNs with different satellite
altitudes and different OFTNs with different optical fiber refractive indexes,
and we study the effect of the number of hops on the crossover distance and
length of a laser inter-satellite link (LISL). It is observed from the
numerical results that the crossover distance increases with an increase in the
number of hops, and this increase is higher at higher satellite altitudes in
OWSNs and lower refractive indexes in OFTNs. Furthermore, an inverse
relationship between the crossover distance and length of a LISL is observed.
With an increase in the number of hops, the length of a LISL decreases as
opposed to the crossover distance.

  To overcome this shortcoming, we study the random covariance matrix in the

the random covariance matrix is governed by a stochastic differential equation

the SDE closely matches the distribution of the random covariance matrix of

supernovae contribution ([Fe/H], [Mg/Fe]). We use 18,135 APOGEE DR17 red clump
stars and 7,943 GALAH DR3 main sequence stars to compare the abundance
distributions conditioned on ([Fe/H], [Mg/Fe]) across $3-13$ kpc and $6.5-9.5$

S, Ca, ($\alpha$), Mn, Ni, Cr, Cu, (iron-peak) Ce, Ba (s-process) and Eu
(r-process). We find that the conditional neutron capture and light elements
most significantly trace variations in the disk's enrichment history, with
absolute conditional radial gradients $\leq 0.03$ dex/kpc. The other elements
studied have absolute conditional gradients $\lesssim 0.01$ dex/kpc. We uncover
structured conditional abundance variations as a function of [Fe/H] for the
low-$\alpha$, but not the high-$\alpha$ sequence. The average scatter between
the mean conditional abundances at different radii is $\sigma_\text{intrinsic}
\approx$ 0.02 dex (with Ce, Eu, Ba $\sigma_\text{intrinsic} >$ 0.05 dex). These
results serve as a measure of the magnitude via which different elements trace
Galactic radial enrichment history once fiducial supernovae correlations are

which not only satisfy functional constraints but are also randomized to
improve variety, robustness, or unpredictability. The recently-proposed
framework of control improvisation (CI) provides techniques for the
correct-by-construction synthesis of randomized systems subject to hard and
soft constraints. However, prior work on CI has focused on qualitative
specifications, whereas in robotic planning and other areas we often have
quantitative quality metrics which can be traded against each other. For
example, a designer of a patrolling security robot might want to know by how
much the average patrol time needs to be increased in order to ensure that a
particular aspect of the robot's route is sufficiently diverse and hence
unpredictable. In this paper, we enable this type of application by
generalizing the CI problem to support quantitative soft constraints which
bound the expected value of a given cost function, and randomness constraints
which enforce diversity of the generated traces with respect to a given label
function. We establish the basic theory of labelled quantitative CI problems,
and develop efficient algorithms for solving them when the specifications are
encoded by finite automata. We also provide an approximate improvisation
algorithm based on constraint solving for any specifications encodable as
Boolean formulas. We demonstrate the utility of our problem formulation and
algorithms with experiments applying them to generate diverse near-optimal

consistently described by an optically thin, lensed accretion flow in the Kerr
spacetime. General relativity (GR) predicts that higher-resolution images of
such a flow would present thin, ring-shaped features produced by photons on
extremely bent orbits. Recent theoretical work suggests that these ""photon
rings"" produce clear interferometric signatures whose observation could provide
a stringent consistency test of the Kerr hypothesis, with scant dependence on
the astrophysical configuration. Gralla, Lupsasca and Marrone (GLM) argued that
the shape of high-order photon rings follows a specific functional form that is
insensitive to the details of the astrophysical source, and proposed an
experimental method for measuring this GR-predicted shape via space-based
interferometry. We wish to assess the robustness of their prediction by
checking that it holds for a variety of astrophysical profiles, black hole
spins and observer inclinations. We repeat their analysis for hundreds of
models and identify the width of the photon ring and its angular variation as a
main obstacle to their method's success. We qualitatively describe how this
width varies with the emission profile, black hole spin and observer
inclination. At low inclinations, an improved method is robust enough to
confirm the shape prediction for a variety of emission profiles; however, the
choice of baseline is critical to the method's success. At high inclinations,
we encounter qualitatively new effects that are caused by the ring's
non-uniform width and require further refinements to the method. We also
explore how the photon ring shape could constrain black hole spin and
inclination.

of borrowers and 98.7 non-borrowers are head of the family and an average 76.6
percent and among the borrowers 32 percent is husband/wife while 1.3 percent of

7.5 percent of non-borrowers are female. The impact of micro-credit in terms of
formal and informal credit receiving households based on DID method showed that
total income, total expenditure and investment have been increased 13.57
percent, 10.39 percent and 26.17 percent. All the elements of total income have
been increased except debt which has been decreased by 2.39 percent. But the
decrease in debt is the good sign of positive impact of debt. Consumption of
food has been increased but non-food has been decreased. All the elements of
investment have been increased except some factors. The savings has been
decreased due excess increase in investment. The study suggested that for
breaking vicious cycle of poverty by micro-credit the duration of loans should
be at least five year and the volume of loans must be minimum 500,000 and
repayment should at not be less than monthly. The rate of interest should not
be more than 5 percent.

acoustic oscillations), ultraviolet counterterms, non-linear redshift-space
distortions, stochastic contributions, projection, and binning effects. The
model is implemented using FFTLog, and validated with the PT Challenge suite of

Focusing on the mass fluctuation amplitude, $\sigma_8$, and galaxy bias
parameters, we find that including one-loop corrections allow us to
significantly extend the range of scales over which the bispectrum can be
modeled, and greatly tightens constraints on bias parameters. However, this
does not lead to noticeable improvements in the $\sigma_8$ errorbar due to the
necessary marginalization over a large number of nuisance parameters with
conservative priors. Analyzing a BOSS-volume likelihood, we find that the
addition of the one-loop bispectrum may lead to improvements on primordial
non-Gaussianity constraints by $\lesssim 30\%$ and on $\sigma_8$ by $\approx
10\%$, though we caution that this requires pushing the analysis to short
scales where the galaxy bias parameters may not be correctly recovered; this
may lead to biases in the recovered parameter values. We conclude that
restrictive priors from simulations or higher-order statistics such as the

Due to the very feeble coupling, the light vector bosons never reach thermal

GeV, the gravitational production can overwhelm the thermal production via the
freeze-in mechanism by many orders of magnitude. As a result, much stronger
constraints from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) can be placed on the
lifetime and mass of the vector bosons compared to the scenario where only
thermal production is considered. As an example, we study the sub-GeV scale
dark photons, which couple to the SM only through kinetic mixing, and derive
constraints on the mass and kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon from
the photodisintegration effects on the light element abundances relevant at the
end of the BBN when the cosmic age was around $10^4$ s.

exhibit a wide range of emission properties both at peak and over their
lifetimes. Some TDEs peak predominantly at X-ray energies while others radiate
chiefly at UV and optical wavelengths. While the peak luminosities across TDEs
show distinct properties, the evolutionary behavior can also vary between TDEs
with similar peak emission properties. At late time, some optical TDEs
rebrighten in X-rays, while others maintain strong UV/optical emission
components. In this Letter, we conduct three-dimensional general relativistic
radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of TDE accretion disks at varying
accretion rates ranging from a few to a few tens of the Eddington accretion
rate. We make use of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations to calculate
the reprocessed spectra at various inclinations and at different evolutionary
stages. We confirm the unified model proposed by Dai et al. (2018), which
predicts that the observed emission largely depends on the viewing angle of the
observer with respect to the disk orientation (X-ray strong when viewed face-on
and UV/optically strong when viewed disk-on). What is more, we find that disks
with higher accretion rates have elevated wind and disk densities, which
increases the reprocessing of the high-energy radiation and thus generally
augments the optical-to-X-ray flux ratio along a particular viewing angle. This
implies that at later times, as the accretion level declines, we expect the
funnel to effectively open up and allow more X-rays to leak out along
intermediate viewing angles. Such dynamical model for TDEs can provide a
natural explanation for the diversity in the emission properties observed in
TDEs at peak and along their temporal evolution.

environment that interacts with quantum systems. Many observers can accurately
infer that information indirectly by making measurements on fragments of the
environment. The correlations between the system, $\mathcal{S}$, and a
fragment, $\mathcal{F}$, of the environment, $\mathcal{E}$, is often quantified
by the quantum mutual information or the Holevo quantity that bounds the
classical information about $\mathcal{S}$ transmittable by a quantum channel
$\mathcal{F}$. The latter is a quantum mutual information but of a
classical-quantum state where measurement has selected outcomes on
$\mathcal{S}$. The measurement generically reflects the influence of the
remaining environment, $\mathcal{E}/\mathcal{F}$, but can also reflect
hypothetical questions to deduce the structure of $\mathcal{S}\mathcal{F}$
correlations. Recently, Touil et al. examined a different Holevo quantity, one
from a quantum-classical state (a quantum $\mathcal{S}$ to a measured
$\mathcal{F}$). As shown here, this quantity upper bounds any accessible
classical information about $\mathcal{S}$ in $\mathcal{F}$ and can yield a
tighter bound than the typical Holevo quantity. When good decoherence is
present$\unicode{x2013}$when the remaining environment,
$\mathcal{E}/\mathcal{F}$, has effectively measured the pointer states of

is related to the error probability for optimal detection and, thus, has the
same behavior as the quantum Chernoff bound. The latter reflects amplification
and provides a universal approach, as well as a single-shot framework, to
quantify records of the missing, classical information about $\mathcal{S}$.

the persistent current pattern. We find that both homodyne and self-heterodyne
interference display a specific dependence on the structure of the Fermi
distribution and particles' correlations. For homodyne protocols, the momentum
distribution is affected by the particle statistics in two distinctive ways.
The first effect is a purely statistical one: at zero interactions, the
characteristic hole in the momentum distribution around the momentum
$\mathbf{k}=0$ opens up once half of the SU($N$) Fermi sphere is displaced. The
second effect originates from interaction: the fractionalization in the
interacting system manifests itself by an additional `delay' in the flux for
the occurrence of the hole, that now becomes a depression at $\mathbf{k}=0$. In
the case of self-heterodyne interference patterns, we are not only able to
monitor, but also observe the fractionalization. Indeed, the fractionalized
angular momenta, due to level crossings in the system, are reflected in
dislocations present in interferograms. Our analysis demonstrate how the study

arising from the competition between non-Fermi liquid states and
multipolar-ordered phases induced by the RKKY interaction. We consider a local

addition to vacuum radiation, partons scatter on the medium constituents

numerical methods. We achieve full analytical control of the relevant scales

aim, we extend existing expansion schemes for the medium-induced spectrum to
the Bethe--Heitler regime. This covers the whole phase space from early to late

the separation of scales, a space-time picture naturally emerges: at early
times, induced emissions start to build from rare scatterings with the medium.
At a later stage, induced emissions due to multiple soft scatterings result in
a turbulent cascade that rapidly degrades energy down to, and including, the
Bethe--Heitler regime. We quantify the impact of such an improved picture,
compared to the current state-of-the-art factorization that includes only soft
scatterings, by both analytical and numerical methods for the medium-induced
energy distribution function. Our work serves to improve our understanding of
jet quenching from small to large systems and for future upgrades of Monte
Carlo generators.

measurements of the Hubble constant and dark energy. Increasing evidence points
towards multiple possible explosion channels as the origin of normal SNe Ia,
with possible systematic effects on the determination of cosmological
parameters. We present, for the first time, a comprehensive comparison of
publicly-available SN Ia model nucleosynthetic data with observations of
late-time light curve observations of SN Ia events. These models span a wide
range of white dwarf (WD) progenitor masses, metallicities, explosion channels,
and numerical methodologies. We focus on the influence of $^{57}$Ni and its
isobaric decay product $^{57}$Co in powering the late-time ($t > 1000$ d) light
curves of SNe Ia. $^{57}$Ni and $^{57}$Co are neutron-rich relative to the more
abundant radioisotope $^{56}$Ni, and are consequently a sensitive probe of
neutronization at the higher densities of near-Chandrashekhar (near-$M_{\rm
Ch}$) progenitor WDs. We demonstrate that observations of one SN Ia event, SN
2015F is only consistent with a sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ WD progenitor. Observations of
four other events (SN 2011fe, SN 2012cg, SN 2014J, SN2013aa) are consistent
with both near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ and sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ progenitors. Continued
observations of late-time light curves of nearby SNe Ia will provide crucial
information on the nature of the SN Ia progenitors.

wave event, and indirect evidence of neutron star mergers based on $r$-process

place novel constraints on the delay time distribution and leverage this result
to infer the merger rate evolution of compact object binaries containing
neutron stars. We recover a power-law slope of $\alpha = -1.83^{+0.35}_{-0.39}$

these constraints to be broadly consistent with theoretical expectations,

in 2019, $\approx$4 mag below the level of its eruptive luminous blue variable

color of $F555W - F814W = 0.4$ mag until 2018, similar to SN 2009ip and
consistent with a spectrum dominated by interaction of the ejecta with
circumstellar material (CSM). A deep optical spectrum obtained in 2021 lacks
signatures of ongoing interaction ($L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} \lesssim 10^{38}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ for broadened emission $\lesssim$2000 km s$^{-1}$), but indicates the
presence of a nearby H II region ($\lesssim$300 pc). The color evolution of the
fading source makes it unlikely that emission from a scattered-light echo or
binary OB companion of the progenitor contributes significantly to the
flattening of the late-time light curve. The remaining emission in 2019 may
plausibly be attributed an evolved/inflated companion or an unresolved
($\lesssim$3 pc), young stellar cluster. Importantly, the color evolution of SN
2015bh rules out scenarios in which the surviving progenitor is obscured by
nascent dust and does not clearly indicate a transition to a hotter, optically
faint state. The simplest explanation is that the massive progenitor did not
survive. SN 2015bh likely represents a remarkable example of the terminal
explosion of a massive star preceded by decades of end-stage eruptive

using several copies of a nonlocal resource to generate one with more
nonlocality. We introduce several distillation schemes which distil an extended
part of the set of nonlocal correlations including quantum correlations. Our
schemes are based on a natural set of operational procedures known as wirings
that can be applied regardless of the underlying theory. Some are sequential
algorithms that repeatedly use a two-copy protocol, while others are genuine
three-copy distillation protocols. In some regions we prove that genuine
three-copy protocols are strictly better than two-copy protocols. By applying
our new protocols we also increase the region in which nonlocal correlations
are known to give rise to trivial communication complexity. This brings us
closer to an understanding of the sets of nonlocal correlations that can be
recovered from information-theoretic principles, which, in turn, enhances our
understanding of what is special about quantum theory.

star's lifetime, when the protoplanetary disc still contains sufficient gas to
be accreted onto the planetary core. The majority of protoplanetary discs are
exposed to strong ultraviolet irradiation from nearby massive stars, which
drives winds and depletes the mass budget for planet formation. It remains
unclear to what degree external photoevaporation affects the formation of
massive planets. In this work, we present a simple one dimensional model for
the growth and migration of a massive planet under the influence of external
FUV fields. We find that even moderate FUV fluxes $F_\mathrm{FUV}\gtrsim 100 \,
G_0$ have a strong influence on planet mass and migration. By decreasing the
local surface density and shutting off accretion onto the planet, external
irradiation suppresses planet masses and halts migration early. The
distribution of typical stellar birth environments can therefore produce an
anti-correlation between semi-major axis and planet mass, which may explain the
apparent decrease in planet occurrence rates at orbital periods
$P_\mathrm{orb}\gtrsim 10^3$ days. Even moderate fluxes $F_\mathrm{FUV}$
strongly suppress giant planet formation and inward migration for any initial
semi-major axis if the stellar host mass $M_*\lesssim 0.5\, M_\odot$,
consistent with findings that massive planet occurrence is much lower around
such stars. The outcomes of our prescription for external disc depletion show
significant differences to the current approximation adopted in
state-of-the-art population synthesis models, motivating future careful
treatment of this important process.

essential to understanding not only the quintessence of dark matter but also
the evolution of the satellites themselves. In this work, we present the
current constraints on dark matter densities in the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) and
diffuse galaxies in the Milky Way. Applying our constructed non-spherical mass
models to the currently available kinematic data of the 25 UFDs and 2 diffuse
satellites, we find that whereas most of the galaxies have huge uncertainties
on the inferred dark matter density profiles, Eridanus~II, Segue~I, and
Willman~1 favor cusped central profiles even considering effects of a prior
bias. We compare our results with the simulated subhalos on the plane between
the dark matter density at 150~pc and the pericenter distance. We find that the
most observed satellites and the simulated subhalos are similarly distributed
on this plane, except for Antlia~2, Crater~2, and Tucana~3 which deviate
considerably from the simulated ones. Despite considering tidal effects, the
subhalos detected by commonly-used subhalo finders can be difficult to explain
such a huge deviation. We also estimate the dynamical mass-to-light ratios of
the satellites and confirm the ratio is linked to stellar mass and metallicity.
Using these scaling relations and the empirical tidal evolution models, we
infer that the scaling laws can be sustained, and furthermore, a metallicity
scatter at the faint-end of the mass-metallicity relation can be explained by
tidal stripping of cusped halos.

explained by our CLOUDY photoionization modeling that, unlike R23-index, the

massive amount of offline data for complex decision-making tasks. Due to the
distribution shift issue, current offline RL algorithms are generally designed
to be conservative in value estimation and action selection. However, such
conservatism can impair the robustness of learned policies when encountering
observation deviation under realistic conditions, such as sensor errors and
adversarial attacks. To trade off robustness and conservatism, we propose
Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning (RORL) with a novel conservative
smoothing technique. In RORL, we explicitly introduce regularization on the
policy and the value function for states near the dataset, as well as
additional conservative value estimation on these states. Theoretically, we
show RORL enjoys a tighter suboptimality bound than recent theoretical results
in linear MDPs. We demonstrate that RORL can achieve state-of-the-art
performance on the general offline RL benchmark and is considerably robust to
adversarial observation perturbations.

necessary structure to also model Cocon. In particular, we can capture the
contextual objects of Cocon using a comonad $\flat$ that restricts presheaves
to their closed elements. This gives a simple semantic characterisation of the
invariants of contextual types (e.g. substitution invariance) and identifies
Cocon as a type-theoretic syntax of presheaf models. We further extend this
characterisation to dependent types using categories with families and show
that we can model a fragment of Cocon without recursor in the Fitch-style

collaborate via a central server to minimize regret. A fraction $\alpha$ of
these agents are adversarial and can act arbitrarily, leading to the following
tension: while collaboration can potentially reduce regret, it can also disrupt
the process of learning due to adversaries. In this work, we provide a
fundamental understanding of this tension by designing new algorithms that
balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off via carefully constructed robust
confidence intervals. We also complement our algorithms with tight analyses.
First, we develop a robust collaborative phased elimination algorithm that
achieves $\tilde{O}\left(\alpha+ 1/\sqrt{M}\right) \sqrt{dT}$ regret for each
good agent; here, $d$ is the model-dimension and $T$ is the horizon. For small
$\alpha$, our result thus reveals a clear benefit of collaboration despite
adversaries. Using an information-theoretic argument, we then prove a matching
lower bound, thereby providing the first set of tight, near-optimal regret
bounds for collaborative linear bandits with adversaries. Furthermore, by
leveraging recent advances in high-dimensional robust statistics, we
significantly extend our algorithmic ideas and results to (i) the generalized
linear bandit model that allows for non-linear observation maps; and (ii) the

the first detection of CO(2-1) in a galaxy lying on the main-sequence of
star-forming galaxies at z>6. Our target, G09-83808 at z=6.03, has a short
depletion time-scale of T_dep~50Myr and a relatively low gas fraction of
M_gas/M_star=0.30 that contrasts with those measured for lower redshift
main-sequence galaxies. We conclude that this galaxy is undergoing a starburst
episode with a high star formation efficiency that might be the result of gas
compression within its compact rotating disk. Its starburst-like nature is
further supported by its high star formation rate surface density, thus
favoring the use of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation as a more precise diagnostic
diagram for starbursts. Without further significant gas accretion, this galaxy
would become a compact, massive quiescent galaxy at z~5.5. In addition, we find
that the calibration for estimating ISM masses from dust continuum emission
satisfactorily reproduces the gas mass derived from the CO(2-1) transition
(within a factor of ~2). This is in line with previous studies claiming a small
redshift evolution in the gas-to-dust ratio of massive, metal-rich galaxies. In
the absence of gravitational amplification, this detection would have required
of order ~1000h of observing time. The detection of cold molecular gas in
unlensed star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is thus prohibitive with
current facilities and requires a ten-fold improvement in sensitivity, such as
that envisaged for the ngVLA.

literature, we are still far from having truly robust methods. While previous
methods have used machine learning with structural/geometric priors, with the
development of Deep Learning (DL), there has been an increase in proposed
Neural Network architectures. Most models focus on improving the training data
and loss functions with little change in the architecture. However, the amount
of accessible training data with expert-labelled ground truth vary between
groups. Moreover, the labels are created not from scratch but from outputs of
non-DL methods. Thus, most DL method's performance depend on the amount and
quality of data one has. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture we call
EVAC+ to work around this issue. We show that EVAC+ has 3 major advantages

Random Fields Recurrent Layer and (3) a loss function specifically created to
enhance this architecture. We compare our model to state-of-the-art non-DL and

fully-sampled images, the reconstructed images are often blurry, where
high-frequency features might not be sharp enough for confident clinical
diagnosis. To this end, we propose an invertible sharpening network
(InvSharpNet) to improve the visual quality of MRI reconstructions. During
training, unlike the traditional methods that learn to map the input data to
the ground truth, InvSharpNet adapts a backward training strategy that learns a
blurring transform from the ground truth (fully-sampled image) to the input
data (blurry reconstruction). During inference, the learned blurring transform
can be inverted to a sharpening transform leveraging the network's
invertibility. The experiments on various MRI datasets demonstrate that
InvSharpNet can improve reconstruction sharpness with few artifacts. The
results were also evaluated by radiologists, indicating better visual quality
and diagnostic confidence of our proposed method.

action recognition algorithms are heavily influenced by visual appearance in
single static frames, there is no quantitative methodology for evaluating such
static bias in the latent representation compared to bias toward dynamic
information (e.g. motion). We tackle this challenge by proposing a novel
approach for quantifying the static and dynamic biases of any spatiotemporal

tasks, action recognition and video object segmentation. Our key findings are
threefold: (i) Most examined spatiotemporal models are biased toward static

show a better balance between the static and dynamic information captured. (ii)
Some datasets that are commonly assumed to be biased toward dynamics are

to the central supermassive black hole. One such class of objects are Ultra
Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (ULIRGs), which are mostly late stage major mergers
of gas-rich galaxies. Recently, large-scale ($\sim$100 kpc) radio continuum
emission has been detected in a select number of ULIRGs, all of which also
harbour powerful Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This hints at the presence of
large-scale radio emission being evidence for nuclear activity. Exploring the
origin of this radio emission and its link to nuclear activity requires high
sensitivity multi-frequency data. We present such an analysis of the ULIRG Mrk
273. Using the International LOFAR telescope (ILT), we detected spectacular
large-scale arcs in this system. This detection includes, for the first time, a
giant $\sim$190 kpc arc in the north. We propose these arcs are fuelled by a
low power radio AGN triggered by the merger. We also identified a bright
$\sim$45 kpc radio ridge, which is likely related to the ionised gas nebula in
that region. We combined this with high sensitivity data from APERture Tile In
Focus (Apertif) and archival data from the Very Large Array (VLA) to explore
the spectral properties. The ILT simultaneously allowed us to probe the nucleus
at a resolution of $\sim$0.3 arcsec, where we detected three components, and,
for the first time, diffuse emission around these components. Combining this
with archival high frequency VLA images of the nucleus allowed us to detect
absorption in one component, and a steep spectrum radio AGN in another. We then
extrapolate from this case study to the importance of investigating the
presence of radio emission in more ULIRGs and what it can tell us about the
link between mergers and the presence of radio activity.

both students and institutions. For students, relying on the work of others too
early in their academic development can make it impossible to acquire necessary
skills for independent success in the future. For institutions, widespread
student cheating can dilute the quality of the educational experience being
offered. Currently available solutions consider only pairwise comparisons
between student submissions and focus on punitive deterrence. Our approach
instead relies on a class-wide statistical characterization that can be clearly
and securely shared with students via an intuitive new p-value representing
independence of student effort. A pairwise, compression-based similarity
detection algorithm captures relationships between assignments more accurately.
An automated deterrence system is used to warn students that their behavior is
being closely monitored. High-confidence instances are made directly available
for instructor review using our open-source toolkit. An unbiased scoring system
aids students and the instructor in understanding true independence of effort.
Preliminary results indicate that the system can provide meaningful
measurements of independence from week one, improving the efficacy of technical
education.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images that can penetrate cloud cover. However,
the large domain gap between optical and SAR images as well as the severe
speckle noise of SAR images may cause significant interference in SAR-based
cloud removal, resulting in performance degeneration. In this paper, we propose
a novel global-local fusion based cloud removal (GLF-CR) algorithm to leverage
the complementary information embedded in SAR images. Exploiting the power of
SAR information to promote cloud removal entails two aspects. The first, global
fusion, guides the relationship among all local optical windows to maintain the
structure of the recovered region consistent with the remaining cloud-free
regions. The second, local fusion, transfers complementary information embedded
in the SAR image that corresponds to cloudy areas to generate reliable texture
details of the missing regions, and uses dynamic filtering to alleviate the
performance degradation caused by speckle noise. Extensive evaluation
demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can yield high quality cloud-free
images and outperform state-of-the-art cloud removal algorithms with a gain
about 1.7dB in terms of PSNR on SEN12MS-CR dataset.

Very often
synchronization is observed in such populations if they are allowed to
interact. A paradigmatic model for the study of such phenomena has been the
Kuramoto model. However, considering real oscillations are rarely isochronous
as a function of energy, it is natural to extend the model by allowing the
natural frequencies to vary as a function of some dynamical resource supply.
Beyond just accounting for a dynamical supply of resources, however,
competition over a \emph{shared} resource supply is important in a variety of
biological systems. In neuronal systems, for example, resource competition
enables the study of neural activity via fMRI. It is reasonable to expect that
this dynamical resource allocation should have consequences for the
synchronization behavior of the brain. This paper presents a modified Kuramoto
dynamics which includes additional dynamical terms that provide a relatively
simple model of resource competition among populations of Kuramoto oscillators.
We design a mutlilayer system which highlights the impact of the competition
dynamics, and we show that in this designed system, correlations can arise
between the synchronization states of two populations of oscillators which
share no phase-coupling edges. These correlations are interesting in light of
the often observed variance between functional and structural connectivity
measures in real systems. The model presented here then suggests that some of
the observed discrepancy may be explained by the way in which the brain
dynamically allocates resources to different regions according to demand. If
true, models such as this one provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the
differences between structural and functional measures, and possibly implicate
dynamical resource allocation as an integral part of the neural computation
process.

compartmentalization is one technique to limit the attacks' effects to the
compromised compartment and not the entire system. Unfortunately, the existing
state-of-the-art embedded hardware-software solutions do not work well to
enforce software compartmentalization for high-end embedded systems. MPUs are
not fine-grained and suffer from significant scalability limitations as they
can only protect a small and fixed number of memory regions. On the other hand,
MMUs suffer from non-determinism and coarse-grained protection. This paper
introduces CompartOS as a lightweight linkage-based compartmentalization model
for high-end, complex, mainstream embedded systems. CompartOS builds on CHERI,
a capability-based hardware architecture, to meet scalability, availability,
compatibility, and fine-grained security goals. Microbenchmarks show that
CompartOS' protection-domain crossing is 95% faster than MPU-based IPC. We
applied the CompartOS model, with low effort, to complex existing systems,
including TCP servers and a safety-critical automotive demo. CompartOS not only
catches 10 out of 13 FreeRTOS-TCP published vulnerabilities that MPU-based
protection (e.g., uVisor) cannot catch but can also recover from them. Further,
our TCP throughput evaluations show that our CompartOS prototype is 52% faster
than relevant MPU-based compartmentalization models (e.g., ACES), with a 15%
overhead compared to an unprotected system. This comes at an FPGA's LUTs
overhead of 10.4% to support CHERI for an unprotected baseline RISC-V

registers area overhead compared to 2% for MPU.

However, many challenging and interesting problems in decision making involve

and oscillating lift reduction across a range of engineering applications. This
research explores the spanwise undulated cylinder inspired by seal whiskers,
shown to reduce lift and drag forces when compared to smooth cylinders.
Although the fluid flow over this unique complex geometry has been documented
experimentally and computationally, investigations surrounding geometric
modifications to the undulation topography have been limited, and fluid
mechanisms by which force reduction is induced have not been fully examined.
Five undulation wavelength variations of the undulated cylinder model are
simulated at Reynolds number $\Rey=250$ and compared with results from a smooth
elliptical cylinder. Vortex structures and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE)
transfer in the wake are analyzed to explain how undulation wavelength affects
force reduction. Modifications to the undulation wavelength generate a variety
of flow patterns including alternating vortex rollers and hairpin vortices.
Maximum force reduction is observed at wavelengths that are large enough to
allow hairpin vortices to develop without intersecting each other and small
enough to prevent the generation of additional alternating flow structures. The
differences in flow structures modify the magnitude and location of TKE
production and dissipation due to changes in mean and fluctuating strain.
Decreased TKE production and increased dissipation in the near wake result in
overall lower TKE and reduced body forces. Understanding the flow physics
linking geometry to force reduction will guide appropriate parameter selection
in bio-inspired design applications.

decisions in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and policy. It
becomes critical to ensure that these models make accurate predictions, are
robust to shifts in the data, do not rely on spurious features, and do not
unduly discriminate against minority groups. To this end, several approaches
spanning various areas such as explainability, fairness, and robustness have
been proposed in recent literature. Such approaches need to be human-centered
as they cater to the understanding of the models to their users. However, there
is a research gap in understanding the human-centric needs and challenges of
monitoring machine learning (ML) models once they are deployed. To fill this
gap, we conducted an interview study with 13 practitioners who have experience
at the intersection of deploying ML models and engaging with customers spanning
domains such as financial services, healthcare, hiring, online retail,
computational advertising, and conversational assistants. We identified various
human-centric challenges and requirements for model monitoring in real-world
applications. Specifically, we found the need and the challenge for the model
monitoring systems to clarify the impact of the monitoring observations on
outcomes. Further, such insights must be actionable, robust, customizable for
domain-specific use cases, and cognitively considerate to avoid information

becoming a large portion of the overall datacenter spend. The emergence of
coherent interfaces like CXL enables main memory expansion and offers an
efficient solution to this problem. In such systems, the main memory can
constitute different memory technologies with varied characteristics. In this
paper, we characterize memory usage patterns of a wide range of datacenter
applications across the server fleet of Meta. We, therefore, demonstrate the
opportunities to offload colder pages to slower memory tiers for these
applications. Without efficient memory management, however, such systems can
significantly degrade performance.
  We propose a novel OS-level application-transparent page placement mechanism
(TPP) for CXL-enabled memory. TPP employs a lightweight mechanism to identify
and place hot/cold pages to appropriate memory tiers. It enables a proactive
page demotion from local memory to CXL-Memory. This technique ensures a memory
headroom for new page allocations that are often related to request processing
and tend to be short-lived and hot. At the same time, TPP can promptly promote
performance-critical hot pages trapped in the slow CXL-Memory to the fast local
memory, while minimizing both sampling overhead and unnecessary migrations. TPP
works transparently without any application-specific knowledge and can be
deployed globally as a kernel release.
  We evaluate TPP in the production server fleet with early samples of new x86
CPUs with CXL 1.1 support. TPP makes a tiered memory system performant as an
ideal baseline (<1% gap) that has all the memory in the local tier. It is 18%
better than today's Linux, and 5-17% better than existing solutions including
NUMA Balancing and AutoTiering. Most of the TPP patches have been merged in the
Linux v5.18 release.

events calculated using density functional theory and nudged elastic band
method show large changes (~1eV) of $\Delta E_a$ in different local chemical
environments of the model face-centered cubic Al-Mg-Zn alloys. Due to local
lattice distortion effects induced by solute atoms (such as Mg) with different
sizes than the matrix element (Al), the changes of $\Delta E_a$ for one type of
migrating atoms originate primarily from fluctuations of $\Delta e_a\equiv
\Delta E_a - \frac{1}{2}\Delta E$. To understand the fluctuations, a quartic
function is shown to accurately describe the energy landscape of the minimum
energy path (MEP) for each vacancy migration event. Analyses of the quartic
function show that $\Delta e_a$ can be approximated with $\Delta e_a \approx
\alpha k_fD^2$, where $\alpha\sim 0.022$ is a constant of all types of
migrating atoms. Here $D$ is the distance of a migrating atom between two
adjacent equilibrium positions and $k_f$ is the average vibration spring
constant of this atom at these two equilibrium positions. $k_f$ and $D$
quantitatively describe the lattice distortion effects on the curvatures and
locations of the MEP at its initial and final states in different local
chemical environments. We also used the local lattice occupations as inputs to
train surrogate models to predict coefficients of the quartic function, which
accurately and efficiently output both $\Delta E_a$ and $\Delta E$ as the
necessary inputs for the mesoscale studies of diffusional transformation in
Al-Mg-Zn alloys.

the cloth configurations and due to ambiguities from occlusions. Our main

performing test-time finetuning with self-supervised losses. The obtained

  Low-Dimensional Manifolds using Deep Networks","52 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the off-policy evaluation problem of reinforcement learning using
deep convolutional neural networks. We analyze the deep fitted Q-evaluation
method for estimating the expected cumulative reward of a target policy, when
the data are generated from an unknown behavior policy. We show that, by
choosing network size appropriately, one can leverage any low-dimensional
manifold structure in the Markov decision process and obtain a sample-efficient
estimator without suffering from the curse of high data ambient dimensionality.
Specifically, we establish a sharp error bound for fitted Q-evaluation, which
depends on the intrinsic dimension of the state-action space, the smoothness of
Bellman operator, and a function class-restricted $\chi^2$-divergence. It is
noteworthy that the restricted $\chi^2$-divergence measures the behavior and
target policies' {\it mismatch in the function space}, which can be small even
if the two policies are not close to each other in their tabular forms. We also
develop a novel approximation result for convolutional neural networks in
Q-function estimation. Numerical experiments are provided to support our
theoretical analysis.

  Fairness-Utility Trade-Offs",,,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In prediction-based decision-making systems, different perspectives can be at
odds: The short-term business goals of the decision makers are often in
conflict with the decision subjects' wish to be treated fairly. Balancing these
two perspectives is a question of values. However, these values are often
hidden in the technicalities of the implementation of the decision-making
system. In this paper, we propose a framework to make these value-laden choices
clearly visible. We focus on a setting in which we want to find decision rules
that balance the perspective of the decision maker and of the decision
subjects. We provide an approach to formalize both perspectives, i.e., to
assess the utility of the decision maker and the fairness towards the decision
subjects. In both cases, the idea is to elicit values from decision makers and
decision subjects that are then turned into something measurable. For the
fairness evaluation, we build on well-known theories of distributive justice
and on the algorithmic literature to ask what a fair distribution of utility
(or welfare) looks like. This allows us to derive a fairness score that we then
compare to the decision maker's utility. As we focus on a setting in which we
are given a trained model and have to choose a decision rule, we use the
concept of Pareto efficiency to compare decision rules. Our proposed framework
can both guide the implementation of a decision-making system and help with
audits, as it allows us to resurface the values implemented in a
decision-making system.

potential energy surface (PES) and a collective variable (CV) that
discriminates between R and P, one can define a free-energy profile (FEP) as
the logarithm of the marginal Boltzmann distribution of the CV. The FEP is not
a true free energy, however, it is common to treat the FEP as the free-energy
analog of the minimum energy path on the PES and to take the activation free
energy, $\Delta F^\ddagger_\mathrm{RP}$, as the difference between the maximum
of the FEP at the transition state and the minimum at R. We show that this
approximation can result in large errors. Since the FEP depends on the CV, it
is therefore not unique, and different, discriminating CVs can yield different
activation free energies for the same reaction. We derive an exact expression
for the activation free energy that avoids this ambiguity with respect to the
choice of CV. We find $\Delta F^\ddagger_\mathrm{RP}$ to be a combination of
the probability of the system being in the reactant state, the probability
density at the transition state surface, and the thermal de~Broglie wavelength
associated with the transition from R to P. We then evaluate the activation
free energies based on our formalism for simple analytic models and realistic
chemical systems. The analytic models show that the widespread FEP-based
approximation applies only at low temperatures for CVs for which the effective
mass of the associated pseudo-particle is small. Most chemical reactions of
practical interest involve polyatomic molecules with complex, high-dimensional
PES that cannot be treated analytically and pose the added challenge of
choosing a good CV, typically through heuristics. We study the influence of the
choice of CV and find that, while the reaction free energy is largely
unaffected, $\Delta F^\ddagger_\mathrm{RP}$ is quite sensitive.

overestimate. While they often support safety-critical functions (e.g., in
medical devices and sensor-alarm combinations), they are usually implemented
under strict cost/energy budgets, using low-end microcontroller units (MCUs)
that lack sophisticated security mechanisms. Motivated by this issue, recent
work developed architectures capable of generating Proofs of Execution (PoX)
for the correct/expected software in potentially compromised low-end MCUs. In
practice, this capability can be leveraged to provide ""integrity from birth"" to
sensor data, by binding the sensed results/outputs to an unforgeable
cryptographic proof of execution of the expected sensing process. Despite this
significant progress, current PoX schemes for low-end MCUs ignore the real-time
needs of many applications. In particular, security of current PoX schemes
precludes any interrupts during the execution being proved. We argue that lack
of asynchronous capabilities (i.e., interrupts within PoX) can obscure PoX
usefulness, as several applications require processing real-time and
asynchronous events. To bridge this gap, we propose, implement, and evaluate an
Architecture for Secure Asynchronous Processing in PoX (ASAP). ASAP is secure
under full software compromise, enables asynchronous PoX, and incurs less
hardware overhead than prior work.

the interplay between the heat spin current and the charge spin current is

point which makes graphene a promising material for a future thermoelectric
spin device due to its long spin lifetime and spin diffusion length.

insufficiently linked to philosophical theories, and their moral meaning is

fairness metrics, which links them to more theories of distributive justice.
The different group fairness metrics differ in their choices about how to
measure the benefit or harm of a decision for the affected individuals, and
what moral claims to benefits are assumed. Our unifying framework reveals the
normative choices associated with standard group fairness metrics and allows an
interpretation of their moral substance. In addition, this broader view
provides a structure for the expansion of standard fairness metrics that we
find in the literature. This expansion allows addressing several criticisms of
standard group fairness metrics, specifically: (1) they are parity-based, i.e.,
they demand some form of equality between groups, which may sometimes be
detrimental to marginalized groups; (2) they only compare decisions across
groups but not the resulting consequences for these groups; and (3) the full
breadth of the distributive justice literature is not sufficiently represented.

exhaustive sweeps of all possible beam directions and scale poorly with high

Gaia astrometry. Among those surveys, the Gaia-ESO Public Spectroscopic Survey
(GES), the only one performed on a 8m class telescope, was designed to target
100,000 stars using FLAMES on the ESO VLT (both Giraffe and UVES
spectrographs), covering all the Milky Way populations, with a special focus on
open star clusters. This article provides an overview of the survey
implementation (observations, data quality, analysis and its success, data
products, and releases), of the open cluster survey, of the science results and
potential, and of the survey legacy. A companion article (Gilmore et al.)
reviews the overall survey motivation, strategy, Giraffe pipeline data
reduction, organisation, and workflow. The GES has determined homogeneous
good-quality radial velocities and stellar parameters for a large fraction of
its more than 110,000 unique target stars. Elemental abundances were derived
for up to 31 elements for targets observed with UVES. Lithium abundances are
delivered for about 1/3 of the sample. The analysis and homogenisation
strategies have proven to be successful; several science topics have been
addressed by the Gaia-ESO consortium and the community, with many highlight
results achieved. The final catalogue has been released through the ESO archive
at the end of May 2022, including the complete set of advanced data products.
In addition to these results, the Gaia-ESO Survey will leave a very important
legacy, for several aspects and for many years to come.

this limitation by constraining background planning to a set of (abstract)

multiple related domains. We leverage the fact that a variety of object classes
share common attributes, with certain geometric differences. We propose
Polymorphic-GAN which learns shared features across all domains and a
per-domain morph layer to morph shared features according to each domain. In
contrast to previous works, our framework allows simultaneous modelling of
images with highly varying geometries, such as images of human faces, painted
and artistic faces, as well as multiple different animal faces. We demonstrate
that our model produces aligned samples for all domains and show how it can be
used for applications such as segmentation transfer and cross-domain image
editing, as well as training in low-data regimes. Additionally, we apply our
Polymorphic-GAN on image-to-image translation tasks and show that we can
greatly surpass previous approaches in cases where the geometric differences
between domains are large.

storage systems instead of traditional file systems. As a result of such a
transition, allocating sufficient resources to users and parties to satisfy
their service level demands has become crucial in cloud storage. In cloud
storage, the schedulability of system components and requests is of great
importance to achieving QoS goals. However, the bufferbloat phenomenon in
storage backends impacts the schedulability of the system. In a storage server,
bufferbloat happens when the server submits all requests immediately to the
storage backend due to a large buffer in the backend. In recent decades, many
studies have focused on the bufferbloat as a latency problem. Nevertheless,
none of these works investigate the impact of bufferbloat on the schedulability
of the system. In this paper, we demonstrate that the bufferbloat impacts
scheduling and performance isolation and identify utilizing admission control
in the storage backend as an easy-to-adopt solution to mitigate bufferbloat.
Moreover, we show that traditional static admission controls are inadequate in
the face of dynamic workloads in cloud environments. Finally, we propose
SlowFast CoDel, an adaptive admission control, as a starting point for
developing adaptive admission control mechanisms to mitigate bufferbloat in
cloud storage.

end-to-end deep learning model to predict dose distributions. However, training
end-to-end methods may be associated with practical limitations due to the
limited size of medical datasets that are often used. To address these
limitations, we propose a content based image retrieval (CBIR) method for
retrieving dose distributions of previously planned patients based on
anatomical similarity. Approach: Our proposed CBIR method trains a
representation model that produces latent space embeddings of a patient's
anatomical information. The latent space embeddings of new patients are then
compared against those of previous patients in a database for image retrieval
of dose distributions. All source code for this project is available on github.
Main Results: The retrieval performance of various CBIR methods is evaluated on
a dataset consisting of both publicly available plans and clinical plans from
our institution. This study compares various encoding methods, ranging from
simple autoencoders to more recent Siamese networks like SimSiam, and the best
performance was observed for the multitask Siamese network. Significance:
Applying CBIR to inform subsequent treatment planning potentially addresses
many limitations associated with end-to-end KBP. Our current results
demonstrate that excellent image retrieval performance can be obtained through
slight changes to previously developed Siamese networks. We hope to integrate
CBIR into automated planning workflow in future works, potentially through
methods like the MetaPlanner framework.

disordered physical systems. Recently, a novel manifestation of Anderson
localization for wave packets launched with a finite average velocity was
proposed, the Quantum boomerang effect (QBE). This phenomenon predicts that the
disorder-averaged center of mass of a particle initially moves ballistically,
then makes a U-turn, and finally slowly returns to its initial position. The
QBE has been predicted to take place in several Hermitian models with Anderson
localization and has been experimentally observed in the paradigmatic quantum
kicked rotor model. In this work, we investigate the emergence of the QBE in
non-Hermitian systems and clarify the importance of symmetries of the
Hamiltonian and the initial state. We generalize the analytical arguments
available in the literature and show that even in the case of complex spectrum
a boomerang-like behavior can appear in a non-Hermitian system. We confirm our
analytical results through a careful numerical investigation of the dynamics
for several non-Hermitian models. We find that non-Hermiticity leads to the
breakdown of the dynamical relation, though the QBE is preserved. This work
opens up new avenues for future investigations in Anderson localized systems.

susceptibility measurements of moment bearing rare-earths ($R$ = Gd - Tm)

polycrystalline average of magnetic susceptibility curves are consistent with
the values for free $R^{3+}$ ion. Strong magnetic anisotropy due to crystalline
electric field effects is observed for moment bearing rare-earths, except
GdV$_6$Sn$_6$. The easy magnetization direction is determined to be $c$-axis
for $R$ = Tb - Ho and $ab$-plane for $R$ = Er, and Tm. The vanadium ions in
$R$V${_6}$Sn${_6}$ possess no magnetic moment. The compounds for $R$ = Y and Lu
exhibit typical characteristics of paramagnetic metals. At low temperatures,
the magnetic ordering is confirmed from magnetization, specific heat, and
resistivity: the highest $T_{N} = 4.9$~K for GdV$_6$Sn$_6$ and the lowest
$T_{N} = 2.3$~K for HoV$_6$Sn$_6$. No magnetic ordering is observed down to
1.8~K for $R$ = Er and Tm. A slight deviation of the magnetic ordering

  sets",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Persistent homology (PH) is a popular tool for topological data analysis that
has found applications across diverse areas of research. It provides a rigorous
method to compute robust topological features in discrete experimental
observations that often contain various sources of uncertainties. Although
powerful in theory, PH suffers from high computation cost that precludes its
application to large data sets. Additionally, most analyses using PH are
limited to computing the existence of nontrivial features. Precise localization
of these features is not generally attempted because, by definition, localized
representations are not unique and because of even higher computation cost. For
scientific applications, such a precise location is a sine qua non for
determining functional significance. Here, we provide a strategy and algorithms
to compute tight representative boundaries around nontrivial robust features in
large data sets. To showcase the efficiency of our algorithms and the precision
of computed boundaries, we analyze three data sets from different scientific
fields. In the human genome, we found an unexpected effect on loops through
chromosome 13 and the sex chromosomes, upon impairment of chromatin loop
formation. In a distribution of galaxies in the universe, we found
statistically significant voids. In protein homologs with significantly
different topology, we found voids attributable to ligand-interaction,
mutation, and differences between species.

An implication of the bounds is that the network is biased to learn the top
eigenfunctions of the Neural Tangent Kernel not just on the training set but
over the entire input space. This bias depends on the model architecture and
input distribution alone and thus does not depend on the target function which
does not need to be in the RKHS of the kernel. The result is valid for deep
architectures with fully connected, convolutional, and residual layers.
Furthermore the width does not need to grow polynomially with the number of
samples in order to obtain high probability bounds up to a stopping time. The
proof exploits the low-effective-rank property of the Fisher Information Matrix
at initialization, which implies a low effective dimension of the model (far
smaller than the number of parameters). We conclude that local capacity control
from the low effective rank of the Fisher Information Matrix is still
underexplored theoretically.

decomposition into sequential simpler low-level steps. Although procedural
planning is a basic skill set for humans in daily life, it remains a challenge
for large language models (LLMs) that lack a deep understanding of the
cause-effect relations in procedures. Previous methods require manual exemplars
to acquire procedural planning knowledge from LLMs in the zero-shot setting.
However, such elicited pre-trained knowledge in LLMs induces spurious

PLANner (PLAN) that elicits procedural planning knowledge from the LLMs with
commonsense-infused prompting. To mitigate spurious goal-step correlations, we
use symbolic program executors on the latent procedural representations to
formalize prompts from commonsense knowledge bases as a causal intervention
toward the Structural Causal Model. Both automatic and human evaluations on

weather, vegetation, and very high resolution data on grid infrastructure
including location, age, materials. With these data we explore a range of
machine learning methods and strategies to manage training data imbalance. The
best area under the receiver operating characteristic we obtain is 0.776 for
distribution feeder ignitions and 0.824 for transmission line wire-down events,
both using the histogram-based gradient boosting tree algorithm (HGB) with
under-sampling. We then use these models to identify which information provides
the most predictive value. After line length, we find that weather and
vegetation features dominate the list of top important features for ignition or
wire-down risk. Distribution ignition models show more dependence on
slow-varying vegetation variables such as burn index, energy release content,
and tree height, whereas transmission wire-down models rely more on primary
weather variables such as wind speed and precipitation. These results point to
the importance of improved vegetation modeling for feeder ignition risk models,
and improved weather forecasting for transmission wire-down models. We observe
that infrastructure features make small but meaningful improvements to risk

density dependent couplings, we analyse the properties of two different matter
compositions: nucleonic matter with delta baryons and nucleonic matter with
hyperons and delta baryons. The delta-meson couplings are allowed to vary
within a wide range of values obtained by experimental data, while the
hyperon-meson couplings are fitted to hypernuclear properties. Neutron star
properties with no deconfinement phase transition are studied. It is verified
that many models are excluded because the effective nucleon mass becomes zero
before the maximum mass configuration is attained. Hyperon-free with
delta-dominated composition compact stars are possible, the deltic stars. It is
found that with a convenient choice of parameters the existence of deltic stars
with 80% of delta baryons at the center of the star is possible. However, the
presence of hyperons lowers the delta baryon fraction to values below 20% at
the center and below 30% at 2-3 saturation densities. It is discussed that in
the presence of delta baryons, the hyperon softening is not so drastic because
deltas couple more strongly to the $\omega$-meson, and the stiffness of the
equation of state is determined by the $\omega$-dominance at high densities.
The speed of sound reflects very well this behavior. The compactness of the
pulsar RX J0720.4-3125 imposes $x_{\sigma\Delta}>x_{\omega\Delta}>1$ and favors
$x_{\rho\Delta}>1$.

heavy dibaryons both in the flavor-symmetric and antisymmetric channels. These
dibaryons have spin zero, and are constructed using various possible
combinations of quark flavors with at least one of them as the charm or the
bottom quark, i.e., namely, $H_c(cudcud), H_b(budbud), H_{bcs}(bcsbcs)$,
$H_{csl}(cslcsl), H_{bsl}(bslbsl)$ and $H_{bcl}(bclbcl)$; $l\in u,d$. We
compute the ground state masses of these dibaryons and the calculations are
performed on three $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ gauge ensembles of the MILC collaboration,
with lattice spacings $a =$ 0.1207, 0.0888 and 0.0582 fm. A relativistic
overlap action is employed for the valence light to charm quarks while a
non-relativistic-QCD Hamiltonian with improved coefficients is used for the
bottom quarks. Unlike the doubly heavy tetraquarks, one and two-flavored heavy
dibaryons, for which lattice QCD calculations have predicted deeply bound
strong-interactions-stable states, for these $H_c, H_b, H_{csl},H_{bsl}$
dibaryons we do not find any such deeply bound state. However, for $H_{bcs}$,
our results indicate the presence of an energy level $29\pm 24$ MeV below the
lowest two-baryon threshold, which could be relevant for its future
experimental searches. Moreover, we find that the energy difference between the
ground state of $H_{bcl}$ and its lowest threshold increases when $m_l>m_s$.
Taken together, our findings indicate the possibility of the existence of the
$H_{bcs}$ dibaryon while all other physical three-flavored dibaryons are much
closer to their thresholds suggesting either they are weakly bound or unbound,
resolving which requires further detail study. Our results also point that the
binding of a dibaryon configuration becomes stronger with the increase of its
valence quark masses which suggests an interesting aspect of strong
interactions at multiple scales.

informational layouts that include images, sitelinks, videos, etc. Ads in these
new formats occupy varying amounts of space, and an advertiser can provide
multiple formats, only one of which can be shown. The seller is now faced with
a multi-parameter mechanism design problem. Computing an efficient allocation
is computationally intractable, and therefore the standard
Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction, while truthful and welfare-optimal, is
impractical.
  In this paper, we tackle a fundamental problem in the design of modern ad
auctions. We adopt a ``Myersonian'' approach and study allocation rules that
are monotone both in the bid and set of rich ads. We show that such rules can
be paired with a payment function to give a truthful auction. Our main
technical challenge is designing a monotone rule that yields a good
approximation to the optimal welfare. Monotonicity doesn't hold for standard
algorithms, e.g. the incremental bang-per-buck order, that give good
approximations to ``knapsack-like'' problems such as ours. In fact, we show
that no deterministic monotone rule can approximate the optimal welfare within
a factor better than $2$ (while there is a non-monotone FPTAS). Our main result
is a new, simple, greedy and monotone allocation rule that guarantees a $3$
approximation.
  In ad auctions in practice, monotone allocation rules are often paired with
the so-called Generalized Second Price (GSP) payment rule, which charges the
minimum threshold price below which the allocation changes. We prove that, even
though our monotone allocation rule paired with GSP is not truthful, its Price
of Anarchy (PoA) is bounded. Under standard no overbidding assumption, we prove
a pure PoA bound of $6$ and a Bayes-Nash PoA bound of $\frac{6}{(1 -
\frac{1}{e})}$. Finally, we experimentally test our algorithms on real-world
data.

found around high-redshift star-forming galaxies. But our understanding of the
nature and powering mechanisms of these halos is still hampered by the complex
radiative transfer effects of the Ly$\alpha$ line and limited angular
resolution. In this paper, we present resolved Multi Unit Spectroscopic

of $L^{*}$ galaxies at $z=2.92$ embedded in a Ly$\alpha$ halo of
$L_{Ly\alpha}=(6.2\pm1.3)\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Globally, the system
shows a line profile that is markedly asymmetric and redshifted, but its width
and peak shift vary significantly across the halo. By fitting the spatially
binned Ly$\alpha$ spectra with a collection of radiative transfer galactic wind
models, we infer a mean outflow expansion velocity of $\approx 211$ km
s$^{-1}$, with higher values preferentially found on both sides of the system's
major axis. The velocity of the outflow is validated with the blueshift of
low-ionization metal absorption lines in the spectra of the central galaxies.
We also identify a faint ($M_{1500} \approx -16.7$) companion detected in both
Ly$\alpha$ and the continuum, whose properties are in agreement with a
predicted population of satellite galaxies that contribute to the extended
Ly$\alpha$ emission. Finally, we briefly discuss the impact of the interaction
between the central galaxies on the properties of the halo and the possibility

  Mesoscopic Devices Due To Bandlimited Quantum Noise","16 pages, 8 figures. First version of a few more",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We are at the midst of second quantum revolution where the mesoscopic quantum
devies are actively employed for technological purposes. Despite this fact, the
description of their real-time dynamics beyond the Fermi's golden rule remains
a formiddable theoretical problem. This is due to the rapid spread of
entanglement within the degrees of freedom of the surrounding environment. This
is accompanied with a quantum noise (QN) acting on the mesoscopic device. In
this work we propose a possible way out: to exploit the fact that this QN is
usually bandlimited. This is because its spectral density is often contained in
peaks of localized modes and resonances, and may be constrained by bandgaps.
Inspired by the Kotelnikov sampling theorem from the theory of classical
bandlimited signals, we put forward and explore the idea that when the QN
spectral density has effective bandwidth $B$, the quantum noise becomes a
discrete-time process, with an elementary time step $\tau\propto B^{-1}$. After
each time step $\tau$, one new QN degree of freedom (DoF) gets coupled to the
device for the first time, and one new QN DoF get irreversibly decoupled. Only
a bounded number of QN DoFs are significantly coupled at any time moment. We
call these DoFs the \textit{Kotelnikov modes}. As a result, the real-time
dissipative quantum motion has a natural structure of a discrete-time matrix
product state, with a bounded bond dimension. This yields a microscopically
derived collision model. The temporal entanglement entropy appears to be
bounded (area-law scaling) in the frame of Kotelnikov modes. The irreversibly
decoupled modes can be traced out as soon as they occur during the real-time
evolution. This leads to a novel\textit{bandlimited} input-output formalism and
to quantum jump Monte Carlo simulation techniques for real-time motion of open
quantum systems. We illustrate this idea on a spin-boson model.

shuffles the data every epoch, and Single Shuffling or Shuffle Once (SO), which
shuffles only at the beginning. We obtain tight convergence rates for RR and SO

sampling. Moving beyond convexity, we obtain similar results for smooth
nonconvex-nonconcave objectives satisfying a two-sided Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz

repeatedly refines them at a higher resolution. Based on the proposed

that span the process of computing and interpreting saliency: methodology, or
how the saliency is calculated; sensitivity, or the relationship between the
saliency and the underlying model and data; and, perceptibility, or how an end
user ultimately interprets the result. By collating this information, saliency
cards allow users to more holistically assess and compare the implications of
different methods. Through nine semi-structured interviews with users from

  Knowledge Distillation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has been intensively investigated for link
prediction by projecting entities and relations into continuous vector spaces.
Current popular high-dimensional KGE methods obtain quite slight performance
gains while require enormous computation and memory costs. In contrast to
high-dimensional KGE models, training low-dimensional models is more efficient
and worthwhile for better deployments to practical intelligent systems.
However, the model expressiveness of semantic information in knowledge graphs
(KGs) is highly limited in the low dimension parameter space. In this paper, we
propose iterative self-semantic knowledge distillation strategy to improve the
KGE model expressiveness in the low dimension space. KGE model combined with
our proposed strategy plays the teacher and student roles alternatively during
the whole training process. Specifically, at a certain iteration, the model is
regarded as a teacher to provide semantic information for the student. At next
iteration, the model is regard as a student to incorporate the semantic
information transferred from the teacher. We also design a novel semantic
extraction block to extract iteration-based semantic information for the
training model self-distillation. Iteratively incorporating and accumulating
iteration-based semantic information enables the low-dimensional model to be
more expressive for better link prediction in KGs. There is only one model
during the whole training, which alleviates the increase of computational
expensiveness and memory requirements. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly combined with other KGE models. Consistent
and significant performance gains in experimental evaluations on four standard
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-distillation
strategy.

Ly$\alpha$ emission around 8683 quasars at $z=$2.34-3.00 using a simple but
very effective broad-band $gri$ selection based on the Third Public Data

broad-band selection detects only bright Ly$\alpha$ emission
($\gtrsim1\times10^{-17}$ erg~s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$) compared with
narrow-band imaging and integral field spectroscopy, we can apply this method
to far more sources than such common approaches. We first generated continuum
$g$-band images without contributions from Ly$\alpha$ emission for host and
satellite galaxies using $r$- and $i$-bands. Then, we established Ly$\alpha$
maps by subtracting them from observed $g$-band images with Ly$\alpha$
emissions. Consequently, we discovered extended Ly$\alpha$ emission (with
masked area $>40$ arcsec$^2$) for 7 and 32 out of 366 and 8317 quasars in the
Deep and Ultra-deep (35 deg$^2$) and Wide (890 deg$^2$) layers, parts of which
may be potential candidates of ELANe. However, none of them seem to be
equivalent to the largest ELANe ever found. We detected higher fractions of
quasars with large nebulae around more luminous or radio-loud quasars,
supporting previous results. Future applications to the forthcoming big data
from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will help us detect more promising
candidates. The source catalogue and obtained Ly$\alpha$ properties for all the

a new unsupervised adaptation method which leverages two different and

jointly optimizes three objectives to learn both class-level global feature and
pixel-level local feature and enforces a regularization between the two. We
demonstrate the efficacy of MUST on a variety of downstream tasks, where it
improves upon CLIP by a large margin. MUST also outperforms supervised few-shot

for regret distribution. Starting from the two-armed bandit setting with time
horizon $T$, we propose a simple policy and prove that the policy (i) enjoys
the worst-case optimality for the expected regret at order $O(\sqrt{T\ln T})$
and (ii) has the worst-case tail probability of incurring a linear regret decay
at an exponential rate $\exp(-\Omega(\sqrt{T}))$, a rate that we prove to be
best achievable for all worst-case optimal policies. Briefly, our proposed
policy achieves a delicate balance between doing more exploration at the
beginning of the time horizon and doing more exploitation when approaching the
end, compared to the standard Successive Elimination policy and Upper
Confidence Bound policy. We then improve the policy design and analysis to work
for the general $K$-armed bandit setting. Specifically, the worst-case
probability of incurring a regret larger than any $x>0$ is upper bounded by
$\exp(-\Omega(x/\sqrt{KT}))$. We then enhance the policy design to accommodate
the ""any-time"" setting where $T$ is not known a priori, and prove equivalently
desired policy performances as compared to the ""fixed-time"" setting with known
$T$. A brief account of numerical experiments is conducted to illustrate the
theoretical findings. We conclude by extending our proposed policy design to
the general stochastic linear bandit setting and proving that the policy leads
to both worst-case optimality in terms of expected regret order and
light-tailed risk on the regret distribution.

approach adopts structural controllability, a theory for controlling a network
(the cell). Motivated to protect the cell from viral infections, we extended
this theory to total controllability and introduced a new concept of control
hubs. Perturbation to any control hub renders the cell uncontrollable by
exogenous stimuli, e.g., viral infections, so control hubs are ideal drug
targets. We developed an efficient algorithm for finding all control hubs and
applied it to the largest homogenous human protein-protein interaction network.
Our new method outperforms several popular gene-selection methods, including
that based on structural controllability. The final 65 druggable control hubs
are enriched with functions of cell proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, and
responses to cellular stress and nutrient levels, revealing critical pathways
induced by SARS-CoV-2. These druggable control hubs led to drugs in 4 major
categories: antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents, drugs on central nerve
systems, and dietary supplements and hormones that boost immunity. Their
functions also provided deep insights into the therapeutic mechanisms of the
drugs for Covid-19 therapy, making the new approach an explainable drug
repurposing method. A remarkable example is Fostamatinib that has been shown to
lower mortality, shorten the length of ICU stay, and reduce disease severity of
hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The drug targets 10 control hubs, 9 of which
are kinases that play key roles in cell differentiation and programmed death.
One such kinase is RIPK1 that directly interacts with viral protein nsp12, the
RdRp of the virus. The study produced many control hubs that were not targets
of existing drugs but were enriched with proteins on membranes and the
NF-$\kappa$B pathway, so are excellent candidate targets for new drugs.

profitable crime in the world. Mexico's geographical position makes it a
country with high levels of human trafficking. Using the snowball sampling
method, the major contribution of this paper is the abstraction of the human
trafficking network on the southern border of Mexico. Based on a social network
analysis, it is identified that the criminal network is moderately centralized
(44.32%) and with medium density (0.401). Therefore, the network has minimal
cohesiveness and members may find it difficult to share information, money, or
products among themselves. To evaluate different dismantling strategies to
tackle the criminal organization, three algorithms are evaluated. We found that
the first actors to be removed are neither the most connected nor the most
peripheral, but the actors who are moderately connected to people of their kind
should be removed. In summary, this paper provides a significant step forward
to understand quantitatively human trafficking networks and evaluate the limits
of dismantling strategies.

level is a crucial first step to understanding how neural activity relates to
perception and behavior. Models of neural dynamics often focus on either
low-dimensional projections of neural activity, or on learning dynamical
systems that explicitly relate to the neural state over time. We discuss how
these two approaches are interrelated by considering dynamical systems as
representative of flows on a low-dimensional manifold. Building on this
concept, we propose a new decomposed dynamical system model that represents
complex non-stationary and nonlinear dynamics of time-series data as a sparse
combination of simpler, more interpretable components. The decomposed nature of
the dynamics generalizes over previous switched approaches and enables modeling
of overlapping and non-stationary drifts in the dynamics. We further present a
dictionary learning-driven approach to model fitting, where we leverage recent
results in tracking sparse vectors over time. We demonstrate that our model can
learn efficient representations and smooth transitions between dynamical modes
in both continuous-time and discrete-time examples. We show results on
low-dimensional linear and nonlinear attractors to demonstrate that our
decomposed dynamical systems model can well approximate nonlinear dynamics.
Additionally, we apply our model to C. elegans data, illustrating a diversity
of dynamics that is obscured when classified into discrete states.

we propose a decentralized FL scheme that is called \underline{f}ederated
\underline{l}earning \underline{e}mpowered \underline{o}verlapped
\underline{c}lustering for \underline{d}ecentralized aggregation (FL-EOCD). The
introduced FL-EOCD leverages device-to-device (D2D) communications and
overlapped clustering to enable decentralized aggregation, where a cluster is
defined as a coverage zone of a typical device. The devices located on the
overlapped clusters are called bridge devices (BDs). In the proposed FL-EOCD
scheme, a clustering topology is envisioned where clusters are connected
through BDs, so as the aggregated models of each cluster is disseminated to the
other clusters in a decentralized manner without the need for a global
aggregator or an additional hop of transmission. Unlike the star-based FL, the
proposed FL-EOCD scheme involves a large number of local devices by reusing the
RRBs in different non-adjacent clusters. To evaluate our proposed FL-EOCD
scheme as opposed to baseline FL schemes, we consider minimizing the overall
energy-consumption of devices while maintaining the convergence rate of FL
subject to its time constraint. To this end, a joint optimization problem,
considering scheduling the local devices/BDs to the CHs and computation
frequency allocation, is formulated, where an iterative solution to this joint
problem is devised. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FL-EOCD algorithm over FL conventional schemes in
terms of energy consumption, latency, and convergence rate.

the emergence of models like GPT-3, prompt-based fine-tuning has been proven to
be a successful approach for few-shot tasks. Inspired by this work, we study
discrete prompt technologies in practice. There are two issues that arise with
the standard prompt approach. First, it can overfit on the prompt template.
Second, it requires manual effort to formulate the downstream task as a

improves runtime on future (i.e., present-day) DNNs by 11.8x geomean.

empirically, some works propose to learn pseudo-environments for invariant
learning. However, it could be misleading when pursuing strict invariance under
latent heterogeneity, since the underlying invariance could have been violated

the distributional invariance property as a relaxed alternative to the strict

prescribed scale and allows a certain degree of variation. We reformulate the
invariant learning problem under latent heterogeneity into a relaxed form that
pursues the distributional invariance, based on which we propose our novel

attention. Although initially formulated as a difficult bi-level optimization
problem, SPG-LS admits tractable reformulations which can be polynomially
globally solved by semidefinite programming or second order cone programming.
However, all the available approaches are not well-suited for handling
large-scale datasets, especially those with huge numbers of features. In this
paper, we explore an alternative reformulation of the SPG-LS. By a novel
nonlinear change of variables, we rewrite the SPG-LS as a spherically
constrained least squares (SCLS) problem. Theoretically, we show that an
$\epsilon$ optimal solution to the SCLS (and the SPG-LS) can be achieved in
$\tilde{O}(N/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ floating-point operations, where $N$ is the
number of nonzero entries in the data matrix. Practically, we apply two
well-known methods for solving this new reformulation, i.e., the Krylov
subspace method and the Riemannian trust region method. Both algorithms are
factorization free so that they are suitable for solving large scale problems.
Numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that the
SPG-LS, equipped with the SCLS reformulation, can be solved orders of magnitude
faster than the state of the art.

numerical simulations that at high dimensions geodetic flows on this surface is
a good model for viscous liquid dynamics. It is shown that this simple model
exhibits viscous dynamics for densities above the percolation threshold in $8$,
$12$ and $16$ dimensions. Thus the slowing down of the dynamics, measured by
the mean-squared displacement, extends to several orders of magnitude similarly
to what is observed in other models for viscous dynamics. Furthermore, the
shape of the mean-squared displacement is to a very good approximation the same
as for the standard model in simulations of viscous liquids: the Kob-Andersen
binary Lennard Jones mixture.

the framework of the Ben-Naim Krapivsky model and stationary state properties
are analytically derived in the asymptotic limit. The heterogeneity is
introduced as a quenched disorder in desired speeds of vehicles. The model
assumes that each vehicle/platoon in a lane moves ballistically until it
approaches a slow moving vehicle/platoon and then joins it. Vehicles in a
platoon are assumed to escape the platoon at a constant rate by changing lanes.
Each lane is assumed to have a different escape rate. As the stationary state
is approached, the platoon density in the two lanes become equal, whereas the
vehicle densities and fluxes are higher in the lane with lower escape rate. A
majority of the vehicles enjoy a free-flow if the harmonic mean of the escape
rates of the lanes is comparable to average initial flux on the road. The
average platoon size is close to unity in the free-flow regime. If the harmonic
mean is lower than the average initial flux, then vehicles with desired speeds
lower than a characteristic speed $v^*$ still enjoy free-flow while those
vehicles with desired speeds that are greater than $v^*$ experience congestion
and form platoons behind the slower vehicles. The characteristic speed depends
on the mean of escape times $(R=(R_1+R_{-1})/2)$ of the two lanes (represented
by 1 and -1) as $v^* \sim R^{-\frac{1}{\mu+2}}$, where $\mu$ is the exponent of
the quenched disorder distribution for desired speed in the small speed limit.
The average platoon size in a lane, when $v^* \ll 1$, is proportional to
$R^{\frac{\mu+1}{\mu+2}}$ plus a lane dependent correction. Equations for the
kinetics of platoon size distribution for two-lane traffic are also studied. It
is shown that a stationary state with platoons as large as road length can
occur only if the mean escape rate is independent of platoon size.

order to improve the performance without increasing memory consumption, we
focus on scale, which is another dimension to improve model performance but
with low memory requirement. The effectiveness has been widely demonstrated in
many CNN-based tasks such as image classification and semantic segmentation,

learning from the benefit of multi-scale, we propose a general framework named
Multi-Scale RNN (MS-RNN) to boost recent RNN models for spatiotemporal

almost all existing SGG models have overlooked the ground-truth annotation
qualities of prevailing SGG datasets, i.e., they always assume: 1) all the

un-annotated negative samples are absolutely background. In this paper, we
argue that both assumptions are inapplicable to SGG: there are numerous ""noisy""

samples actually harm the training of unbiased SGG models. To this end, we
propose a novel model-agnostic NoIsy label CorrEction strategy for SGG: NICE.
NICE can not only detect noisy samples but also reassign more high-quality
predicate labels to them. After the NICE training, we can obtain a cleaner
version of SGG dataset for model training. Specifically, NICE consists of three
components: negative Noisy Sample Detection (Neg-NSD), positive NSD (Pos-NSD),
and Noisy Sample Correction (NSC). Firstly, in Neg-NSD, we formulate this task
as an out-of-distribution detection problem, and assign pseudo labels to all
detected noisy negative samples. Then, in Pos-NSD, we use a clustering-based
algorithm to divide all positive samples into multiple sets, and treat the
samples in the noisiest set as noisy positive samples. Lastly, in NSC, we use a
simple but effective weighted KNN to reassign new predicate labels to noisy
positive samples. Extensive results on different backbones and tasks have
attested to the effectiveness and generalization abilities of each component of

However, these intermediate representations are often not in natural language

ScratchPlot, first prompts a PLM to compose a content plan. Then, we generate
the story's body and ending conditioned on the content plan. Furthermore, we
take a generate-and-rank approach by using additional PLMs to rank the

uninterleaved optimization for its value and policy networks. These distinct

and proofreading, increasing fidelity greatly, e.g., from one error per million

mechanism has not been established, and most speculations are based on
exploiting thermodynamic equilibrium and free energy. Moreover, the
corresponding enzyme needs to recognize not only mismatches but also correct

because mistaking correct matches for mismatches would introduce extra errors
due to repair mistakes. Thus, non-equilibrium should play a role because it has
the ability to give rise to high recognition accuracy by consuming adenosine

actual MMR enzymes is incomplete, we construct a hypothetical enzyme, which is
a quantum system having three discrete energy levels. ATP raises the enzyme to
the highest energy level to trigger a spontaneous quantum transition, whose
result is one of the two low energy levels, each representing a possible

probabilities of the two outcomes is exponentially proportional to the energy
gap between the two low energy levels. The energy gap can flip to discriminate
between mismatches and correct matches.

|\det(U_t - e^{i \theta})|^{\gamma} dt d\theta $$ converge in the limit of
large dimension to the $2d$ LQG measure, a properly normalized exponential of
the $2d$ Gaussian free field. Gaussian free field type fluctuations associated
with these dynamics were first established by Spohn (1998) and convergence to
the LQG measure in $2d$ settings was conjectured since the work of Webb (2014),
who proved the convergence of related one dimensional measures by using inputs
from Riemann-Hilbert theory.
  The convergence follows from the first multi-time extension of the result by
Widom (1973) on Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants with real
symbols. To prove these, we develop a general surgery argument and combine
determinantal point processes estimates with stochastic analysis on Lie group,
providing in passing a probabilistic proof of Webb's $1d$ result. We believe
the techniques will be more broadly applicable to matrix dynamics out of

block out the solar light, we contrast the use of a conventional internal

external occulter, not being a subject to the diffraction limit of the
observing telescope, makes it possible to use small telescopes (e.g., $\sim

self-luminous at these wavelengths, producing a strong signal, while there is
significantly less noise from the solar corona. This part of the spectrum

in building modern machine learning systems. In industrial settings, there is
usually an embedding team that trains an embedding model to solve intended
tasks (e.g., product recommendation). The produced embeddings are then widely
consumed by consumer teams to solve their unintended tasks (e.g., fraud
detection). However, as the embedding model gets updated and retrained to
improve performance on the intended task, the newly-generated embeddings are no
longer compatible with the existing consumer models. This means that historical
versions of the embeddings can never be retired or all consumer teams have to
retrain their models to make them compatible with the latest version of the
embeddings, both of which are extremely costly in practice. Here we study the
problem of embedding version updates and their backward compatibility. We
formalize the problem where the goal is for the embedding team to keep updating
the embedding version, while the consumer teams do not have to retrain their
models. We develop a solution based on learning backward compatible embeddings,
which allows the embedding model version to be updated frequently, while also
allowing the latest version of the embedding to be quickly transformed into any
backward compatible historical version of it, so that consumer teams do not
have to retrain their models. Under our framework, we explore six methods and
systematically evaluate them on a real-world recommender system application. We
show that the best method, which we call BC-Aligner, maintains backward
compatibility with existing unintended tasks even after multiple model version
updates. Simultaneously, BC-Aligner achieves the intended task performance
similar to the embedding model that is solely optimized for the intended task.

An essential facet of turbulence is the space-time intermittency of
the cascade of energy that leads to coherent structures of high dissipation.
Aims. In this work, we attempt to investigate systematically the physical
nature of the intense dissipation regions in decaying isothermal
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence. Methods. We probe the turbulent
dissipation with grid based simulations of compressible isothermal decaying MHD
turbulence. We take unprecedented care at resolving and controlling
dissipation: we design methods to locally recover the dissipation due to the
numerical scheme. We locally investigate the geometry of the gradients of the
fluid state variables. We develop a method to assess the physical nature of the
largest gradients in simulations and to estimate their travelling velocity.
Finally we investigate their statistics. Results. We find that intense
dissipation regions mainly correspond to sheets: locally, density, velocity and
magnetic fields vary primarily across one direction. We identify these highly
dissipative regions as fast/slow shocks or Alfv{\'e}n discontinuities (Parker
sheets or rotational discontinuities). On these structures, we find the main
deviation from 1D planar steady-state is mass loss in the plane of the
structure. We investigate the effect of initial conditions which yield
different imprints at early time on the relative distributions between these
four categories. However, these differences fade out after about one turnover
time, when they become dominated by weakly compressible Alfv{\'e}n
discontinuities. We show that the magnetic Prandtl number has little influence
on the statistics of these discontinuities, but it controls the Ohmic vs
viscous heating rates within them. Finally, we find the entrance
characteristics of the structures (such as entrance velocity and magnetic
pressure) are strongly correlated. Conclusions. These new methods allow to
consider developed compressible turbulence as a statistical collection of
intense dissipation structures. This can be used to post-process 3D turbulence
with detailed 1D models apt for comparison with observations. It could also
reveal useful as a framework to formulate new dynamical properties of
turbulence.

image effects such as Bokeh. However, those predicted by single image depth
estimation (SIDE) models often fail to capture isolated holes in objects and/or
have inaccurate boundary regions. Meanwhile, high-quality masks are much easier
to obtain, using commercial auto-masking tools or off-the-shelf methods of
segmentation and matting or even by manual editing. Hence, in this paper, we
formulate a novel problem of mask-guided depth refinement that utilizes a
generic mask to refine the depth prediction of SIDE models. Our framework
performs layered refinement and inpainting/outpainting, decomposing the depth
map into two separate layers signified by the mask and the inverse mask. As
datasets with both depth and mask annotations are scarce, we propose a
self-supervised learning scheme that uses arbitrary masks and RGB-D datasets.
We empirically show that our method is robust to different types of masks and
initial depth predictions, accurately refining depth values in inner and outer

of the growing trend of the nodule. In order to improve the performance of
growth trend prediction for lung nodules, it is vital to compare the changes of
the same nodule in consecutive CT scans. Motivated by this, we screened out
4,666 subjects with more than two consecutive CT scans from the National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST) dataset to organize a temporal dataset called NLSTt. In
specific, we first detect and pair regions of interest (ROIs) covering the same
nodule based on registered CT scans. After that, we predict the texture
category and diameter size of the nodules through models. Last, we annotate the
evolution class of each nodule according to its changes in diameter. Based on
the built NLSTt dataset, we propose a siamese encoder to simultaneously exploit
the discriminative features of 3D ROIs detected from consecutive CT scans. Then
we novelly design a spatial-temporal mixer (STM) to leverage the interval
changes of the same nodule in sequential 3D ROIs and capture spatial
dependencies of nodule regions and the current 3D ROI. According to the
clinical diagnosis routine, we employ hierarchical loss to pay more attention

may arise due to, for instance, the use of certain auxiliary techniques like

re-parameterization of certain quantities such as model and/or observation
error covariance matrices, and so on. Given the richness of the established
assimilation algorithms, and the abundance of the approaches through which
hyper-parameters are introduced to the assimilation algorithms, one may ask
whether it is possible to develop a sound and generic method to efficiently
choose various types of (sometimes high-dimensional) hyper-parameters. This
work aims to explore a feasible, although likely partial, answer to this
question. Our main idea is built upon the notion that a data assimilation
algorithm with hyper-parameters can be considered as a parametric mapping that
links a set of quantities of interest (e.g., model state variables and/or
parameters) to a corresponding set of predicted observations in the observation
space. As such, the choice of hyper-parameters can be recast as a parameter
estimation problem, in which our objective is to tune the hyper-parameters in
such a way that the resulted predicted observations can match the real
observations to a good extent. From this perspective, we propose a
hyper-parameter estimation workflow and investigate the performance of this
workflow in an ensemble Kalman filter. In a series of experiments, we observe
that the proposed workflow works efficiently even in the presence of a
relatively large amount (up to $10^3$) of hyper-parameters, and exhibits
reasonably good and consistent performance under various conditions.

scaling, however, is notoriously fragile to noise. While for some noise types
it can be restored through error correction, for other important types, such as
dephasing, the Heisenberg scaling appears to be irremediably lost. Here we show
that this limitation can sometimes be lifted if the experimenter has the
ability to probe physical processes in a coherent superposition of alternative
configurations. As a concrete example, we consider the problem of phase
estimation in the presence of a random phase kick, which in normal conditions
is known to prevent the Heisenberg scaling. We provide a parallel protocol that
achieves Heisenberg scaling with respect to the probes' energy, as well as a
sequential protocol that achieves Heisenberg scaling with respect to the total
probing time. In addition, we show that Heisenberg scaling can also be achieved

suggested that the frequency of giant planets may decrease for
intermediate-mass stars ($2.5-8\,M_\odot$). The key mechanism that could hinder
their formation remains unclear. From a theoretical point of view, planet
formation around intermediate-mass stars may take place on longer timescales,
which -- coupled with fast migration and efficient photoevaporation -- may
prevent planetary formation in these environments. In this letter, we
investigate the temporal evolution of the radial drift for dust particles in
disks when stellar evolution is taken into account. We demonstrate that the
particle drift velocity around intermediate-mass stars sharply increases after
1$-$2 Myr, potentially forming a difficult barrier to overcome in the first
steps of planet formation. This high radial drift could explain the lack of
disk detections around intermediate-mass stars older than 3$-$4 Myr, as opposed
to low-mass stars ($<2.5\,M_\odot$), where the drift may not be the most
impactful factor for the disk evolution. Future high-resolution images of these
disks can help us to explain why planets around intermediate-mass stars may be
rare. In addition, we can explore whether the role of efficient dust radial
drift does in fact hinder planet formation around intermediate-mass stars -- or
otherwise.

approach to curvature and wide-angle effects on the galaxy 2-point correlation
function in redshift space. In particular we derive the Alcock-Paczynski
distortion of $f\sigma_{8}$, which differs significantly from empirical models
in the literature. A key innovation is the use of the `Clustering Ratio', which
probes clustering in a different way to redshift-space distortions, so that
their combination delivers more powerful cosmological constraints. We use this
combination to constrain cosmological parameters, without CMB information. In a
curved Universe, we find that $\Omega_{{\rm m}, 0}=0.26\pm 0.04$ (68\% CL).
When the clustering probes are combined with low-redshift background probes --
BAO and SNIa -- we obtain a CMB-independent constraint on curvature:
$\Omega_{K,0} = 0.0041\,_{-0.0504}^{+0.0500}$. We find no Bayesian evidence
that the flat concordance model can be rejected. In addition we show that the
sound horizon at decoupling is $r_{\rm d} = 144.57 \pm 2.34 \; {\rm Mpc}$, in
agreement with its measurement from CMB anisotropies. As a consequence, the
late-time Universe is compatible with flat $\Lambda$CDM and a standard sound
horizon, leading to a small value of $H_{0}$, {\em without} assuming any CMB
information. Clustering Ratio measurements produce the only low-redshift
clustering data set that is not in disagreement with the CMB, and combining the
two data sets we obtain $\Omega_{K,0}= -0.023 \pm 0.010$.

disrupt a wide range of industries, cloud datacenters face ever-increasing
demand in inference workloads. However, conventional CPU-based servers cannot
handle excessive computational requirements of deep neural network (DNN)
models, while GPU-based servers suffer from huge power consumption and high
operating cost. In this paper, we present a scalable systolic-vector
architecture that can cope with dynamically changing DNN workloads in cloud
datacenters. We first devise a lightweight DNN model description format called
unified model format (UMF) that enables general model representation and fast
decoding in hardware accelerator. Based on this model format, we propose a
heterogeneous architecture that features a load balancer that performs a
high-level workload distribution and multiple systolic-vector clusters, in
which each cluster consists of a programmable scheduler, throughput-oriented
systolic arrays, and function-oriented vector processors. We also propose a
heterogeneity-aware scheduling algorithm that enables concurrent execution of
multiple DNN workloads while maximizing heterogeneous hardware utilization
based on computation and memory access time estimation. Finally, we build an
architecture simulation framework based on actual synthesis and place-and-route
implementation results and conduct design space exploration for the proposed
architecture. As a result, the proposed systolic-vector architecture achieves
10.9x higher throughput performance and 30.17x higher energy efficiency than a
compatible GPU on realistic ML workloads. The proposed heterogeneity-aware
scheduling algorithm improves the throughput and energy efficiency by 81% and
20%, respectively, compared to a standard round-robin scheduling.

Interaction(HOI) detection has made significant progress. However, there is
still room for improvement in video HOI detection performance. Existing
one-stage methods use well-designed end-to-end networks to detect a video
segment and directly predict an interaction.
  It makes the model learning and further optimization of the network more
complex. This paper introduces the Spatial Parsing and Dynamic Temporal Pooling
(SPDTP) network, which takes the entire video as a spatio-temporal graph with
human and object nodes as input. Unlike existing methods, our proposed network
predicts the difference between interactive and non-interactive pairs through
explicit spatial parsing, and then performs interaction recognition. Moreover,
we propose a learnable and differentiable Dynamic Temporal Module(DTM) to
emphasize the keyframes of the video and suppress the redundant frame.
Furthermore, the experimental results show that SPDTP can pay more attention to
active human-object pairs and valid keyframes. Overall, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on CAD-120 dataset and Something-Else dataset.

Current spatial-temporal action detection methods mostly use an object detector

large performance drop exists with the vanilla one-stage pipeline and extra

The ability to manipulate 2DEGs using gate voltages could offer a degree of

both in amplitude and in sign. This achievement in a 2DEG-CoFeB/MgO

the data scientists' arsenal, as they dramatically reduce the manual work
devoted to the construction of ML pipelines. Such frameworks intelligently
search among millions of possible ML pipelines - typically containing feature
engineering, model selection and hyper parameters tuning steps - and finally
output an optimal pipeline in terms of predictive accuracy. However, when the
dataset is large, each individual configuration takes longer to execute,
therefore the overall AutoML running times become increasingly high. To this
end, we present SubStrat, an AutoML optimization strategy that tackles the data
size, rather than configuration space. It wraps existing AutoML tools, and
instead of executing them directly on the entire dataset, SubStrat uses a
genetic-based algorithm to find a small yet representative data subset which
preserves a particular characteristic of the full data. It then employs the
AutoML tool on the small subset, and finally, it refines the resulted pipeline
by executing a restricted, much shorter, AutoML process on the large dataset.
Our experimental results, performed on two popular AutoML frameworks,
Auto-Sklearn and TPOT, show that SubStrat reduces their running times by 79%

detailed population synthesis code, we simulate the Gaia spectra for the above

powers above ~300 the accuracy of the classification depends exclusively on the
SNR of the spectra, while below that value the SNR should be increased as the
resolving power is reduced to maintain a certain accuracy. The algorithm is
then applied to the already classified SDSS WDMS catalogue, revealing that the
automated classification exhibits an accuracy comparable (or even higher) to
previous classification methods. Finally, we simulate the {\it Gaia} spectra,
showing that our algorithm is able to correctly classify nearly 80% the

challenge, because it is not straightforward to tell whether the decision is
correct or not, and how to verify it systematically. In this paper, a
Sequential MetAmoRphic Testing Smart framework is proposed based on metamorphic
testing, a mainstream software testing approach. In metamorphic testing,
metamorphic groups are constructed by selecting multiple inputs according to
the so-called metamorphic relations, which are basically the system's necessary
properties; the violation of certain relations by some corresponding
metamorphic groups implies the detection of erroneous system behaviors. The
proposed framework makes use of sequences of metamorphic groups to understand
ADS behaviors, and is applicable without the need of ground-truth datasets. To
demonstrate its effectiveness, the framework is applied to test three ADS
models that steer an autonomous car in different scenarios with another car
either leading in front or approaching in the opposite direction. The conducted
experiments reveal a large number of undesirable behaviors in these top-ranked
deep learning models in the scenarios. These counter-intuitive behaviors are
associated with how the core models of ADS respond to different positions,
directions and properties of the other car in its proximity. Further analysis

and their subtypes were utilized for the analysis of available feedback
options. The study revealed difficulties in identifying clear-cut boundaries
between feedback types, as the offered feedback usually integrates more than
one type or subtype. Moreover, currently defined feedback types do not
rigorously distinguish individualized and generic feedback. The lack of
granularity is also evident in the absence of subtypes relating to the

IoT devices can differ from traditional computing, thereby the design and
implementation of proper security measures can be challenging in IoT devices.
We observed that IoT developers discuss their security-related challenges in
developer forums like Stack Overflow(SO). However, we find that IoT security
discussions can also be buried inside non-security discussions in SO. In this
paper, we aim to understand the challenges IoT developers face while applying
security practices and techniques to IoT devices. We have two goals: (1)
Develop a model that can automatically find security-related IoT discussions in
SO, and (2) Study the model output to learn about IoT developer
security-related challenges. First, we download 53K posts from SO that contain
discussions about IoT. Second, we manually labeled 5,919 sentences from 53K
posts as 1 or 0. Third, we use this benchmark to investigate a suite of deep
learning transformer models. The best performing model is called SecBot.
Fourth, we apply SecBot on the entire posts and find around 30K security
related sentences. Fifth, we apply topic modeling to the security-related
sentences. Then we label and categorize the topics. Sixth, we analyze the
evolution of the topics in SO. We found that (1) SecBot is based on the
retraining of the deep learning model RoBERTa. SecBot offers the best F1-Score
of 0.935, (2) there are six error categories in misclassified samples by
SecBot. SecBot was mostly wrong when the keywords/contexts were ambiguous

security topics grouped into three categories: Software, Hardware, and Network,

  Learning with Shuffle Instances",,,,,"eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) technique can significantly ac-celerate
the diagnostic workflow of pancreatic cancer by immediately analyzing the
fast-stained cytopathological images with on-site pathologists. Computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) using the deep learning method has the potential to solve the
problem of insufficient pathology staffing. However, the cancerous patterns of
ROSE images vary greatly between different samples, making the CAD task
extremely challenging. Besides, due to different staining qualities and various
types of acquisition devices, the ROSE images also have compli-cated
perturbations in terms of color distribution, brightness, and contrast. To
address these challenges, we proposed a novel multiple instance learning (MIL)
approach using shuffle patches containing the instances, which adopts the
patch-based learning strategy of Vision Transformers. With the re-grouped bags
of shuffle instances and their bag-level soft labels, the approach utilizes a
MIL head to make the model focus on the features from the pancreatic cancer
cells, rather than that from various perturbations in ROSE images.
Simultaneously, combined with a classification head, the model can effectively
identify the gen-eral distributive patterns across different instances. The
results demonstrate the significant improvements in the classification accuracy
with more accurate at-tention regions, indicating that the diverse patterns of
ROSE images are effec-tively extracted, and the complicated perturbations of
ROSE images are signifi-cantly eliminated. It also suggests that the MIL with
shuffle instances has great potential in the analysis of cytopathological

the contents that are published on DOSNs are stored on the devices made

published by a user could be stored on the devices of other users, simply
because they are online when required. Consequently, such contents must be
properly protected by the DOSN infrastructure, in order to ensure that they can

a consequence, DOSNs require efficient solutions for protecting the privacy of

privacy enforcement models adopted by current DOSNs evaluating their
suitability to support different types of privacy policies based on user

Their main drawback however is that these methods are hardly able to recognize

of the camera changes. To overcome this limitation and at the same time exploit
a useful source of supervision, we take into account video object tracks.
Following the intuition that two patches in a track should have similar visual

the same category since they likely belong to the same object or object part.
Experimental results on two downstream tasks on different datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our Online Deep Clustering with Video Track Consistency

high-quality and robust reconstruction results. Specifically, RegSDF takes an
additional oriented point cloud as input, and optimizes a signed distance field

introduce the two critical regularizations for this optimization. The first one
is the Hessian regularization that smoothly diffuses the signed distance values
to the entire distance field given noisy and incomplete input. And the second
one is the minimal surface regularization that compactly interpolates and
extrapolates the missing geometry. Extensive experiments are conducted on DTU,
BlendedMVS, and Tanks and Temples datasets. Compared with recent neural surface
reconstruction approaches, RegSDF is able to reconstruct surfaces with fine
details even for open scenes with complex topologies and unstructured camera

The transmission across the first sidebands begins at 0 and follows the pattern
of a sinusoidal function that grows with increasing barrier width and becomes
nearly linear for larger incident energy. When the strain magnitude is

marginally in the armchair direction but increases dramatically in the zigzag

from the total number of observed period is 3.12\%. No underlying emission is
detected in the averaged off pulse profile. For bursts with fluence larger than

$-3.1\pm0.4$, suggesting the existence of bright pulse emission. We find that
the distribution of time between subsequent pulses is consistent with a

(WD)-$10^{4-6}M_{\odot}$ massive black hole (MBH) binary formed by the Hill
mechanism. In this system, the tidal induced internal oscillation of WD can
heat the WD envelope thereby induces the tidal nova and inflates the WD
envelope, which can be captured by the MBH and form a TDE. The tidal stripping
of the surviving WD in the eccentric orbit can produce the QPEs. We also apply
this model to the other four QPE sources. Based on the estimated fallback rate,
we find that the remaining time after the QPE-observed time for these QPEs is
only around 1-2 years based on our simple model estimation, and then the WD
will be fully disrupted. We also show that the accretion rate can be much
higher than Eddington accretion rate in final stage of these QPE sources. The
peak frequency of spectral energy distribution of disk stays in soft X-ray band

  to reviewers' comments",,"10.4230/LIPIcs.WABI.2022.22",,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many bioinformatics applications involve bucketing a set of sequences where
each sequence is allowed to be assigned into multiple buckets. To achieve both
high sensitivity and precision, bucketing methods are desired to assign similar
sequences into the same bucket while assigning dissimilar sequences into
distinct buckets. Existing $k$-mer-based bucketing methods have been efficient
in processing sequencing data with low error rate, but encounter much reduced
sensitivity on data with high error rate. Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)
schemes are able to mitigate this issue through tolerating the edits in similar
sequences, but state-of-the-art methods still have large gaps. Here we
generalize the LSH function by allowing it to hash one sequence into multiple
buckets. Formally, a bucketing function, which maps a sequence (of fixed
length) into a subset of buckets, is defined to be $(d_1, d_2)$-sensitive if
any two sequences within an edit distance of $d_1$ are mapped into at least one
shared bucket, and any two sequences with distance at least $d_2$ are mapped
into disjoint subsets of buckets. We construct locality-sensitive bucketing
(LSB) functions with a variety of values of $(d_1,d_2)$ and analyze their
efficiency with respect to the total number of buckets needed as well as the
number of buckets that a specific sequence is mapped to. We also prove lower
bounds of these two parameters in different settings and show that some of our
constructed LSB functions are optimal. These results provide theoretical
foundations for their practical use in analyzing sequences with high error rate
while also providing insights for the hardness of designing ungapped LSH
functions.

models heavily rely on CNN feature extractors, and the long-range contextual
dependencies are usually ignored. In this work, we propose Dual
Swin-Transformer based Mutual Interactive Network. We adopt Swin-Transformer as
the feature extractor for both RGB and depth modality to model the long-range
dependencies in visual inputs. Before fusing the two branches of features into
one, attention-based modules are applied to enhance features from each
modality. We design a self-attention-based cross-modality interaction module
and a gated modality attention module to leverage the complementary information
between the two modalities. For the saliency decoding, we create different
stages enhanced with dense connections and keep a decoding memory while the
multi-level encoding features are considered simultaneously. Considering the
inaccurate depth map issue, we collect the RGB features of early stages into a
skip convolution module to give more guidance from RGB modality to the final
saliency prediction. In addition, we add edge supervision to regularize the
feature learning process. Comprehensive experiments on five standard RGB-D SOD
benchmark datasets over four evaluation metrics demonstrate the superiority of

baseline strategy, where a session is offloaded onto unlicensed band only when
there are no resources available in the licensed one, leads to the best
performance. The offloading strategy, where sessions with heavier-than-average

second time, examining the case when the diffusion coefficient is piecewise

performance deficiencies due to model generalization and the inefficiency in
handling individual image specific deformations. Here we present a new neural
net based image registration framework, called NIR (Neural Image Registration),
which is based on optimization but utilizes deep neural nets to model
deformations between image pairs. NIR represents the transformation between two
images with a continuous function implemented via neural fields, receiving a 3D
coordinate as input and outputting the corresponding deformation vector. NIR
provides two ways of generating deformation field: directly output a
displacement vector field for general deformable registration, or output a
velocity vector field and integrate the velocity field to derive the
deformation field for diffeomorphic image registration. The optimal
registration is discovered by updating the parameters of the neural field via
stochastic gradient descent. We describe several design choices that facilitate
model optimization, including coordinate encoding, sinusoidal activation,
coordinate sampling, and intensity sampling. Experiments on two 3D MR brain

We estimated the false-positive rate and analyzed the time evolution of

associated with near-Earth asteroids, and 4% may be linked to near-Earth
comets. This implies that a significant fraction of meter-sized impactors
producing large bolides may have an asteroidal or cometary origin. In addition,
we found at least three bolides having hyperbolic orbits with high tensile
strength values. Meter-sized meteoroids of interstellar origin could be more
common than previously thought, representing about 1% of the flux of large

medium could bias these projectiles towards high strength rocks with the
ability to survive prolonged exposure to the harsh interstellar space

collapse affects training is still largely unanswered, and its investigation is
necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of this architecture. In this

First, we show that rank collapse of the tokens' representations hinders
training by causing the gradients of the queries and keys to vanish at
initialization. Furthermore, we provide a thorough description of the origin of
rank collapse and discuss how to prevent it via an appropriate depth-dependent
scaling of the residual branches. Finally, our analysis unveils that specific

differently, leading to disproportionate gradient norms. This suggests an

energy generated in hydrogen burning is lost in a form of photon emission (64
%), gravitational energy (lifting-up the wind matter against the gravity, 35

bright in a far-UV (100 - 300 \AA) band, during a day just after the onset of

generation typically having a symmetrical square pulse profile. While this
method is well known, the impact of third order dispersion (TOD) on DSR is yet
to be fully addressed in the literature. In this article, the impact of TOD on
DSR is numerically investigated under the frame of the complex cubic-quintic
Ginzburg-Landau equation (CQGLE). Our numerical investigations indicate that
DSR can stably exist under TOD with nearly the same pulse amplitude, but with a
(significantly) different pulse duration. Depending on the value of chromatic
dispersion, the pulse duration can be notably longer or shorter due to the
presence of TOD. The TOD effect also alters the dependence of pulse duration on
the nonlinear gain. Another impact of TOD on DSR is that the DSR exists with an
asymmetric pulse profile, leading to steepening of one edge of the DSR pulse,
while flattening of the other. Our results indicate that TOD has a critical
role for realizing DSR in mode-locked lasers and it should be taken into
consideration during design and development of DSR-based lasers.

one candidate from a pool and each candidate belongs to a sensitive group. In
this setting, candidates' rewards may not be directly comparable between
groups, for example when the agent is an employer hiring candidates from
different ethnic groups and some groups have a lower reward due to
discriminatory bias and/or social injustice. We propose a notion of fairness
that states that the agent's policy is fair when it selects a candidate with
highest relative rank, which measures how good the reward is when compared to
candidates from the same group. This is a very strong notion of fairness, since
the relative rank is not directly observed by the agent and depends on the
underlying reward model and on the distribution of rewards. Thus we study the
problem of learning a policy which approximates a fair policy under the
condition that the contexts are independent between groups and the distribution
of rewards of each group is absolutely continuous. In particular, we design a
greedy policy which at each round constructs a ridge regression estimate from
the observed context-reward pairs, and then computes an estimate of the
relative rank of each candidate using the empirical cumulative distribution
function. We prove that, despite its simplicity and the lack of an initial
exploration phase, the greedy policy achieves, up to log factors and with high
probability, a fair pseudo-regret of order $\sqrt{dT}$ after $T$ rounds, where
$d$ is the dimension of the context vectors. The policy also satisfies
demographic parity at each round when averaged over all possible information

achieve satisfactory levels of privacy. Achieving this however requires strong
assumptions which may not hold in practice, including precise and uniform
subsampling of clients, and a highly trusted aggregator to process clients'
data. In this paper, we explore a more practical protocol, shuffled check-in,
to resolve the aforementioned issues. The protocol relies on client making
independent and random decision to participate in the computation, freeing the
requirement of server-initiated subsampling, and enabling robust modelling of
client dropouts. Moreover, a weaker trust model known as the shuffle model is
employed instead of using a trusted aggregator. To this end, we introduce new
tools to characterize the R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) of shuffled
check-in. We show that our new techniques improve at least three times in
privacy guarantee over those using approximate DP's strong composition at
various parameter regimes. Furthermore, we provide a numerical approach to
track the privacy of generic shuffled check-in mechanism including distributed
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with Gaussian mechanism. To the best of our

[$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}z\leq0$, where $N(z)$ is the buoyancy frequency], we
obtain flows with a longer interaction range (than in uniform stratification)
and highly dispersive Rossby waves. In the staircase limit, we find straight
jets that are perturbed by eastward propagating along jet waves, similar to
two-dimensional barotropic $\beta$-plane turbulence. In contrast, over
increasing stratification [$\mathrm{d}N(z)/\mathrm{d}z\geq0$], we obtain flows
with shorter interaction range and weakly dispersive Rossby waves. In the
staircase limit, we find sinuous jets with large latitudinal meanders whose
shape evolves in time due to the westward propagation of weakly dispersive
along jet waves. These along jet waves have larger amplitudes over increasing
stratification than over decreasing stratification, and, as a result, the ratio
of domain-averaged zonal to meridional speeds is two to three times smaller
over increasing stratification than over decreasing stratification. Finally, we
find that, for a given Rhines wavenumber, jets over increasing stratification
are closer together than jets over decreasing stratification.

significantly from the value obtained in the ($2+1$)-flavor case, which is most
likely due to the effect of the charm quark. We also report results for
$r_{0}$, $r_{1}$, and $r_{2}$ in~fm, with the former two being slightly lower
than published ($2+1$)-flavor results. We study in detail the effect of the
charm quark on the static energy by comparing our results on the finest two
lattices with the previously published ($2+1$)-flavor QCD results at similar
lattice spacing. We find that for $r > 0.2$~fm our results on the static energy
agree with the ($2+1$)-flavor result, implying the decoupling of the charm
quark for these distances. For smaller distances, on the other hand, we find
that the effect of the dynamical charm quark is noticeable. The lattice results
agree well with the two-loop perturbative expression of the static energy
incorporating finite charm mass effects. This is the first time that the
decoupling of the charm quark is observed and quantitatively analyzed on
lattice data of the static energy.

is a growing need to operate DNNs on edge devices. Edge devices are typically
limited in their computational resources, yet, often multiple edge devices are
deployed in the same environment and can reliably communicate with each other.
In this work we propose to facilitate the application of DNNs on the edge by
allowing multiple users to collaborate during inference to improve their
accuracy. Our mechanism, coined {\em edge ensembles}, is based on having
diverse predictors at each device, which form an ensemble of models during
inference. To mitigate the communication overhead, the users share quantized
features, and we propose a method for aggregating multiple decisions into a
single inference rule. We analyze the latency induced by edge ensembles,
showing that its performance improvement comes at the cost of a minor
additional delay under common assumptions on the communication network. Our
experiments demonstrate that collaborative inference via edge ensembles
equipped with compact DNNs substantially improves the accuracy over having each
user infer locally, and can outperform using a single centralized DNN larger
than all the networks in the ensemble together.

communication, and our ability to exploit them effectively is paramount. This
article presents a novel theory -- Representational Systems Theory -- that is
designed to abstractly encode a wide variety of representations from three core
perspectives: syntax, entailment, and their properties. By introducing the
concept of a construction space, we are able to encode each of these core
components under a single, unifying paradigm. Using our Representational
Systems Theory, it becomes possible to structurally transform representations
in one system into representations in another. An intrinsic facet of our
structural transformation technique is representation selection based on
properties that representations possess, such as their relative cognitive
effectiveness or structural complexity. A major theoretical barrier to
providing general structural transformation techniques is a lack of terminating
algorithms. Representational Systems Theory permits the derivation of partial
transformations when no terminating algorithm can produce a full
transformation. Since Representational Systems Theory provides a universal
approach to encoding representational systems, a further key barrier is
eliminated: the need to devise system-specific structural transformation
algorithms, that are necessary when different systems adopt different
formalisation approaches. Consequently, Representational Systems Theory is the
first general framework that provides a unified approach to encoding
representations, supports representation selection via structural
transformations, and has the potential for widespread practical application.

ERC. Although existing researchers have proposed various methods of speaker

further hindering emotion prediction. To this end, we design a novel speaker
modeling scheme that explores intra- and inter-speaker dependencies jointly in

diffraction, STM topography and DFT calculations. Free-base
tetra-phenyl-porphyrins (2H-TPP) adsorb on the oxygen rows, where they can
spontaneously capture two additional hydrogen atoms at their iminic nitrogens
(4H-TPP). Both 2H-TPP and 4H-TPP molecules aggregate into a commensurate phase
at the saturation coverage of one monolayer. Upon sample heating, a
self-metalation reaction sets in at 100C, yielding full metalation of the
saturated monolayer at ~200C. The Ti atoms are extracted from the substrate
and, by simultaneous dehydrogenation of the pyrrolic nitrogen atoms,
incorporated into the porphyrin macrocycle, where they remain coordinated to
two oxygen atoms underneath. Neither the adsorption geometry (on-bridge, atop
the oxygen rows) nor the molecular arrangement change across the
self-metalation transition up to 300C. On one side, the robustness of this
saturation phase makes it a promising system for its implementation into
applications for photocatalysis and photovoltaic devices. On the other side,
the possible manifestation of metal exchange with the very reactive Ti atoms
must be taken into account when designing porphyrin-sensitized solar cells
since the critical temperature for the onset of self-metalation is very close
to the normal operating temperature of photovoltaic devices.

on deep neural networks (DNNs). Due to their black-box nature, faithful and
robust explanation methods need to accompany classifiers for deployment in
real-life scenarios. However, it has been shown in vision applications that
explanation methods are susceptible to local, imperceptible perturbations that
can significantly alter the explanations without changing the predicted
classes. We show here that the existence of such perturbations extends to text
classifiers as well. Specifically, we introduceTextExplanationFooler (TEF), a
novel explanation attack algorithm that alters text input samples imperceptibly
so that the outcome of widely-used explanation methods changes considerably
while leaving classifier predictions unchanged. We evaluate the performance of
the attribution robustness estimation performance in TEF on five sequence
classification datasets, utilizing three DNN architectures and three
transformer architectures for each dataset. TEF can significantly decrease the
correlation between unchanged and perturbed input attributions, which shows
that all models and explanation methods are susceptible to TEF perturbations.
Moreover, we evaluate how the perturbations transfer to other model
architectures and attribution methods, and show that TEF perturbations are also
effective in scenarios where the target model and explanation method are
unknown. Finally, we introduce a semi-universal attack that is able to compute
fast, computationally light perturbations with no knowledge of the attacked
classifier nor explanation method. Overall, our work shows that explanations in
text classifiers are very fragile and users need to carefully address their
robustness before relying on them in critical applications.

there are limited studies of long-term effects when working in VR. This paper
addresses the need for understanding such long-term effects. Specifically, we
report on a comparative study (n=16), in which participants were working in VR

Hence, during this study, we do not present the participants with the best

expected, VR results in significantly worse ratings across most measures. Among
other results, we found concerning levels of simulator sickness, below average

cloud is one of the critical tasks in autonomous navigation. A ground vehicle
needs to look for traversable terrains that are explorable by wheels. Then, to
make safe navigation decisions, the segmentation of objects positioned on those
terrains has to be followed up. However, over-segmentation and
under-segmentation can negatively influence such navigation decisions. To that
end, we propose TRAVEL, which performs traversable ground detection and object
clustering simultaneously using the graph representation of a 3D point cloud.
To segment the traversable ground, a point cloud is encoded into a graph
structure, tri-grid field, which treats each tri-grid as a node. Then, the
traversable regions are searched and redefined by examining local convexity and
concavity of edges that connect nodes. On the other hand, our above-ground
object segmentation employs a graph structure by representing a group of
horizontally neighboring 3D points in a spherical-projection space as a node
and vertical/horizontal relationship between nodes as an edge. Fully leveraging
the node-edge structure, the above-ground segmentation ensures real-time
operation and mitigates over-segmentation. Through experiments using
simulations, urban scenes, and our own datasets, we have demonstrated that our
proposed traversable ground segmentation algorithm outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in terms of the conventional metrics and that our
newly proposed evaluation metrics are meaningful for assessing the above-ground
segmentation. We will make the code and our own dataset available to public at

existing observations serves as benchmark constraints for models. AIMS: We
present some observational evidences to guide future hydrodynamical simulations
and common envelope studies. METHODS: Using archive spectra taken at high and
mid spectral resolution during the V1309 Sco outburst and late decline,
together with the inferential methods we developed to study nova ejecta through
panchromatic high resolution spectroscopic follow ups, we constrain the
physical state, structure, dynamics and geometry of the transient originated in
the stellar merger. RESULTS: We found that the emitted spectra arise from two
distinct contributions: matter expelled during the 2008 outburst and
circumbinary gas produced during historic mass loss episodes. These two
components likely have orthogonal geometry with the 2008 mass loss displaying a
dust-laden bipolar ejecta produced by a time limited rapidly accelerating wind
and the circumbinary gas having a donut-like shape. A central source powers
them both, having produced a fluorescent light pulse, but we cannot precisely
determine the time it started or its spectral energy distribution. We can,
however, place its upper energy cutoff at about 54 eV and the bulk of its
emission at $<$20 eV. We also know that the central source turned off within
months from the outburst and before the ejecta turned optically thin.

training data distribution optimization problem, namely to obtain desired
training data within limited interactions, and address them concurrently via i)
explicit modeling and control of the capacity and diversity of behavior policy
and ii) more fine-grained and adaptive control of selective/sampling
distribution of the behavior policy using a monotonic data distribution
optimization. Finally, we integrate this process into Generalized Policy

operator-based versions of well-known RL methods from DQN to Agent57.
Theoretical guarantee of the superiority of GDI compared with GPI is concluded.
We also demonstrate our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning

nonlinear strict-feedback-like systems. While the dynamic controller structure
is based on the dual dynamic high-gain scaling based approach, we cast the
design procedure within a general matrix pencil structure unlike prior results
that utilized conservative algebraic bounds of terms arising in Lyapunov
inequalities. The design freedoms in the dynamic controller are extracted in
terms of generalized eigenvalues associated with matrix pencils formulated to
capture the detailed structures (locations of uncertain terms in the system
dynamics and their state dependences) of bounds in the Lyapunov analysis. The
proposed approach enables efficient computation of non-conservative bounds with
reduced algebraic complexity and enhances feasibility of application of the
dual dynamic high-gain scaling based control designs. The proposed approach is
developed under both the state-feedback and output-feedback cases and the
efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through simulation studies on a
numerical example.

for a base system, are re-trained using a small dataset from a target system.
For effective TL, we need to know 1) what are the best layers to re-train? and
2) what physics are learned during TL? Here, we present novel analyses and a
new framework to address (1)-(2) for a broad range of multi-scale, nonlinear

spectral analyses of convolutional NN's activations and kernels, explaining the
inner-workings of TL in terms of the system's nonlinear physics. Using
subgrid-scale modeling of several setups of 2D turbulence as test cases, we
show that the learned kernels are combinations of low-, band-, and high-pass
filters, and that TL learns new filters whose nature is consistent with the
spectral differences of base and target systems. We also find the shallowest
layers are the best to re-train in these cases, which is against the common
wisdom guiding TL in machine learning literature. Our framework identifies the
best layer(s) to re-train beforehand, based on physics and NN theory. Together,
these analyses explain the physics learned in TL and provide a framework to
guide TL for wide-ranging applications in science and engineering, such as

inherit bias from training data and become unfair for some user groups.
However, existing fair machine learning methods usually rely on the centralized
storage of fairness-sensitive features to achieve model fairness, which are
usually inapplicable in federated scenarios. In this paper, we propose a fair
vertical federated learning framework (FairVFL), which can improve the fairness
of VFL models. The core idea of FairVFL is to learn unified and fair
representations of samples based on the decentralized feature fields in a
privacy-preserving way. Specifically, each platform with fairness-insensitive
features first learns local data representations from local features. Then,
these local representations are uploaded to a server and aggregated into a
unified representation for the target task. In order to learn a fair unified
representation, we send it to each platform storing fairness-sensitive features
and apply adversarial learning to remove bias from the unified representation
inherited from the biased data. Moreover, for protecting user privacy, we
further propose a contrastive adversarial learning method to remove private
information from the unified representation in server before sending it to the
platforms keeping fairness-sensitive features. Experiments on three real-world
datasets validate that our method can effectively improve model fairness with
user privacy well-protected.

for $\tau_w$, the expected time of collapse, are lacking, mainly due to its

system size, tensile force, but also the detailed microscopic interactions
between constituents. The complex dependence of the collapse time on all the
parameters is discussed below, using simulations of strip of amorphous

resulting in serious difficulties in creating an all-encompassing theory that
could offer safety measures for given conditions. A central aim of this paper
is to employ scaling concepts, to achieve data collapse for the probability
distribution function (pdf) of $\ln{\tau_w}$. The scaling ideas result in a
universal function which provides a prediction of the pdf of $\ln{\tau_w}$ for
out-of-sample systems, from measurements at other values of these parameters.
The predictive power of the scaling theory is demonstrated for both ductile and
brittle systems. Finally, we present a derivation of universal scaling function
for brittle materials. The ductile case appears to be due to a plastic necking

improving their social skills is of utmost importance. Nonetheless, social
robotics still faces many challenges. One bottleneck is that robotic behaviors
need to be often adapted as social norms depend strongly on the environment.
For example, a robot should navigate more carefully around patients in a
hospital compared to workers in an office. In this work, we investigate
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) as a potential solution. Here, robot
behaviors are learned via reinforcement learning where a reward function needs
to be chosen so that the robot learns an appropriate behavior for a given
environment. We propose to use a variational meta-RL procedure that quickly
adapts the robots' behavior to new reward functions. As a result, given a new
environment different reward functions can be quickly evaluated and an
appropriate one selected. The procedure learns a vectorized representation for
reward functions and a meta-policy that can be conditioned on such a
representation. Given observations from a new reward function, the procedure
identifies its representation and conditions the meta-policy to it. While
investigating the procedures' capabilities, we realized that it suffers from
posterior collapse where only a subset of the dimensions in the representation
encode useful information resulting in a reduced performance. Our second
contribution, a radial basis function (RBF) layer, partially mitigates this
negative effect. The RBF layer lifts the representation to a higher dimensional
space, which is more easily exploitable for the meta-policy. We demonstrate the
interest of the RBF layer and the usage of meta-RL for social robotics on four
robotic simulation tasks.

devices such as pacemakers are commonly used in patients at high risk of sudden
cardiac death. While great advances have been made in medical technology, there
remain significant challenges in effective management of common arrhythmias.
This thesis proposes novel arrhythmia detection and prediction methods to
differentiate cardiac arrhythmias from non-life-threatening cardiac events, to
increase the likelihood of detecting events that may lead to mortality, as well
as reduce the incidence of unnecessary therapeutic intervention. The methods
are based on detailed analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) information. The
results of the work show good performance of the proposed methods and support
the potential for their deployment in resource-constrained devices for
ventricular and atrial arrhythmia prediction, such as implantable pacemakers
and defibrillators.

characteristic (e.g., temperature, distance, speed, etc.) into a signal that
can be digitally measured and processed to perform specific tasks. Mobile
robots need sensors to measure properties of their environment, thus allowing
for safe navigation, complex perception and corresponding actions and effective
interactions with other agents that populate it. Sensors used by mobile robots
range from simple tactile sensors, such as bumpers, to complex vision-based
sensors such as structured light cameras. All of them provide a digital output
(e.g., a string, a set of values, a matrix, etc.) that can be processed by the
robot's computer. Such output is typically obtained by discretizing one or more
analog electrical signals by using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
included in the sensor. In this chapter we present the most common sensors used
in mobile robotics, providing an introduction to their taxonomy, basic features
and specifications. The description of the functionalities and the types of
applications follows a bottom-up approach: the basic principles and components
on which the sensors are based are presented before describing real-world
sensors, which are generally based on multiple technologies and basic devices.

Creation of much larger motors should be possible if a very low-density system

than dense solid ones in constrictions. Millimotors are created from permeable
capsules of bacterial cellulose that are coated with catalase-containing
metal-organic frameworks, enabling reactive propulsion in aqueous hydrogen
peroxide. The motion of the motors is quantified using particle tracking and
the deformation is measured using microcapillary compression and flow through
confined channels. Two different propulsion mechanisms are dominant depending
on the motor surface chemistry: oxygen bubbles are expelled from hydrophilic
millimotors, driving motion via reaction force and buoyancy. Hydrophobic
millimotors remain attached to growing bubbles and move by buoyancy alone.

observations of the model response. The Bayesian approach is powerful for
solving such problems; one formulates a prior distribution for the parameter
state that is updated with the observations to compute the posterior parameter
distribution. Solving for the posterior distribution can be challenging when,
e.g., prior and posterior significantly differ from one another and/or the
parameter space is high-dimensional. We use a sequence of importance sampling
measures that arise by tempering the likelihood to approach inverse problems
exhibiting a significant distance between prior and posterior. Each importance
sampling measure is identified by cross-entropy minimization as proposed in the
context of Bayesian inverse problems in Engel et al. (2021). To efficiently
address problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces we set up the
minimization procedure in a low-dimensional subspace of the original parameter
space. The principal idea is to analyse the spectrum of the second-moment
matrix of the gradient of the log-likelihood function to identify a suitable
subspace. Following Zahm et al. (2021), an upper bound on the
Kullback-Leibler-divergence between full-dimensional and subspace posterior is
provided, which can be utilized to determine the effective dimension of the
inverse problem corresponding to a prescribed approximation error bound. We
suggest heuristic criteria for optimally selecting the number of model and
model gradient evaluations in each iteration of the importance sampling
sequence. We investigate the performance of this approach using examples from
engineering mechanics set in various parameter space dimensions.

Aligning with recent AI-enabled wireless implementations, this paper introduces
autonomic radios, 6G-AUTOR, that leverage novel algorithm-hardware separation
platforms, softwarization of transmission (TX) and reception (RX) operations,
and automatic reconfiguration of RF frontends, to support link performance and
resilience. As a comprehensive transceiver solution, our design encompasses
several ML-driven models, each enhancing a specific aspect of either TX or RX,
leading to robust transceiver operation under tight constraints of future
wireless systems. A data-driven radio management module was developed via deep
Q-networks to support fast-reconfiguration of TX resource blocks (RB) and
proactive multi-agent access. Also, a ResNet-inspired fast-beamforming solution
was employed to enable robust communication to multiple receivers over the same
RB, which has potential applications in realisation of cell-free
infrastructures. As a receiver the system was equipped with a capability of
ultra-broadband spectrum recognition. Apart from this, a fundamental tool -
automatic modulation classification (AMC) which involves a complex correntropy
extraction, followed by a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
classification, and a deep learning-based LDPC decoder were added to improve
the reception quality and radio performance. Simulations of individual
algorithms demonstrate that under appropriate training, each of the
corresponding radio functions have either outperformed or have performed on-par
with the benchmark solutions.

by a mixture of a few mutational signatures. The mutational signatures can be
found using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). To extract the mutational
signatures we have to assume a distribution for the observed mutational counts
and a number of mutational signatures. In most applications, the mutational
counts are assumed to be Poisson distributed, and the rank is chosen by
comparing the fit of several models with the same underlying distribution and
different values for the rank using classical model selection procedures.
However, the counts are often overdispersed, and thus the Negative Binomial
distribution is more appropriate. We propose a Negative Binomial NMF with a
patient specific dispersion parameter to capture the variation across patients.
We also introduce a novel model selection procedure inspired by
cross-validation to determine the number of signatures. Using simulations, we
study the influence of the distributional assumption on our method together
with other classical model selection procedures and we show that our model
selection procedure is more robust at determining the correct number of
signatures under model misspecification. We also show that our model selection
procedure is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods for finding the true
number of signatures. Other methods are highly overestimating the number of
signatures when overdispersion is present. We apply our proposed analysis on a
wide range of simulated data and on two real data sets from breast and prostate

MARVOLO employs semantics-preserving code transformations that mimic the

previously learned tasks in order to learn new ones quickly and efficiently.
Meta-learning approaches have emerged as a popular solution to achieve this.
However, meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms have thus far been
restricted to simple environments with narrow task distributions. Moreover, the
paradigm of pretraining followed by fine-tuning to adapt to new tasks has
emerged as a simple yet effective solution in supervised and self-supervised
learning. This calls into question the benefits of meta-learning approaches
also in reinforcement learning, which typically come at the cost of high
complexity. We hence investigate meta-RL approaches in a variety of
vision-based benchmarks, including Procgen, RLBench, and Atari, where
evaluations are made on completely novel tasks. Our findings show that when
meta-learning approaches are evaluated on different tasks (rather than
different variations of the same task), multi-task pretraining with fine-tuning
on new tasks performs equally as well, or better, than meta-pretraining with
meta test-time adaptation. This is encouraging for future research, as
multi-task pretraining tends to be simpler and computationally cheaper than
meta-RL. From these findings, we advocate for evaluating future meta-RL methods
on more challenging tasks and including multi-task pretraining with fine-tuning
as a simple, yet strong baseline.

minimizing the total energy consumption. The stated optimization problem is

this imposed assumption is not necessarily true, especially in high dimensions.
To tackle this problem, a hierarchical training approach is employed to improve

harder-when-brighter in the $\gamma$-ray band, which is consistent with the
observed optical bluer-when-brighter trend on both long-term and intraday

  Systems: A Decomposition and Dynamic Programming Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the optimal spatiotemporal pricing of autonomous
mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. We consider a platform that operates a fleet
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and determines the pricing, rebalancing, and fleet
sizing strategies over the transportation network in response to demand
fluctuations. A network flow model is formulated to characterize the evolution
of system states over space and time. Fundamental elements in AMoD markets are
captured, including demand elasticity, passenger waiting time,
vehicle-passenger matching, proactive vehicle rebalancing, and dynamic fleet
sizing. The platform's profit maximization problem is cast as a constrained
optimal control problem, which is highly nonconvex due to the nonlinear demand
model and passenger-vehicle matching model. An integrated decomposition and
dynamic programming approach is developed to tackle this optimal control
problem, where we first relax the problem through a change of variables, then
separate the relaxed problem into a few small-scale subproblems via dual
decomposition, and finally obtain the exact solution to each relaxed subproblem
through dynamic programming. Despite the non-convexity, the proposed method
establishes a theoretical upper bound to evaluate the optimality gap of the
obtained solution. The proposed approach is validated with numerical studies
using real data from New York City. We find that the platform adopts distinct
operation strategies in core and non-core areas of the city because of the
asymmetric demand pattern. Furthermore, we also find that low-demand areas are
less resilient than high-demand ones when demand surges unexpectedly, because
the operator prioritizes supporting high-demand areas at the sacrifice of
service quality in low-demand areas.

the true $M_{\rm HI}$ signal, and that weighting schemes based on noise
properties provide unbiased results. On the contrary, weighting schemes based
on distance can account for significant systematic mass differences when
applied to a flux-limited sample ($\Delta M_{\rm HI}\sim 40-50\%$ in the

the stacking procedure ($ \Delta z\sim 0.00035$, i.e. $\Delta v \sim 100\,{\rm

size of the galaxy sample by exploiting the geometric symmetries of galaxy
cubelets, potentially enhancing the SNR by a factor $\sim\sqrt{2}$ when
analyzing the final stacked spectrum (a factor 4 in a cubelet). This procedure

try to extract some knowledge from physics-based training methods, such as
neural ODE (ordinary differential equation). Neural ODE has advantages like a
possibly higher class of represented functions, the extended interpretability
compared to black-box machine learning models, ability to describe both trend
and local behaviour. Such advantages are especially critical for time series
with complicated trends. However, the known drawback is the high training time
compared to the autoregressive models and long-short term memory (LSTM)
networks widely used for data-driven time series modelling. Therefore, we
should be able to balance interpretability and training time to apply neural
ODE in practice. The paper shows that modern neural ODE cannot be reduced to
simpler models for time-series modelling applications. The complexity of neural
ODE is compared to or exceeds the conventional time-series modelling tools. The
only interpretation that could be extracted is the eigenspace of the operator,
which is an ill-posed problem for a large system. Spectra could be extracted
using different classical analysis methods that do not have the drawback of
extended time. Consequently, we reduce the neural ODE to a simpler linear form

increased responsivity of 709 mA/W. Besides, the heterojunction photodetector

uncertain), desired outcome. Though hope is a virtue, hopelessness is
widespread and seems related not only to current events but also to information
about current events. This paper examines how hope can be sparked through
information. Method. This study uses the philosophical methods of conceptual
analysis and design to advance a theoretical argument. Analysis. First, a
conceptualization of hope is offered, drawing on work primarily in virtue
ethics. Then, four types of information sources for hope are theorized,
building on and synthesizing work from philosophy and psychology. Results. Four
categories of information source conducive to hopefulness are identified:
information for forming beliefs about the past or future; information for
engaging the moral imagination regarding possibilities for the future;
information for sparking desire for particular moral outcomes; and information
for metacognition, or about how we become informed with respect to hope.
Conclusions. Hope is, in many cases, responsive to information. This suggests a
moral opportunity for information professionals and scholars to work toward
connecting people with information for hope, particularly in difficult times.
Avenues for further research, particularly in information behavior and
practices, are suggested.

spatially-resolved molecular gas depletion times (\tau_dep = 1/SFE) with a
spatial resolution of \approx 100 pc within a galactocentric radius of 1.8 kpc.
We identify a star-forming ring located at radii 1.25 \pm 0.6 kpc with an
average \tau_dep of 0.3 Gyr. At radii < 0.9 kpc, however, the molecular gas
surface densities and depletion times increase with decreasing radius, the
latter reaching approximately 2.3 Gyr at a radius \approx 500 pc. Based on
analyses of the gas kinematics and comparisons with simulations, we identify
AGN feedback, bulge morphology and dynamics as the possible causes of the
radial profile of SFE observed in the central region of NGC 3169.

Peterson","Subject Membership Inference Attacks in Federated Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Privacy attacks on Machine Learning (ML) models often focus on inferring the
existence of particular data points in the training data. However, what the
adversary really wants to know is if a particular individual's (subject's) data
was included during training. In such scenarios, the adversary is more likely
to have access to the distribution of a particular subject than actual records.
Furthermore, in settings like cross-silo Federated Learning (FL), a subject's
data can be embodied by multiple data records that are spread across multiple
organizations. Nearly all of the existing private FL literature is dedicated to
studying privacy at two granularities -- item-level (individual data records),
and user-level (participating user in the federation), neither of which apply
to data subjects in cross-silo FL. This insight motivates us to shift our
attention from the privacy of data records to the privacy of data subjects,
also known as subject-level privacy. We propose two novel black-box attacks for
subject membership inference, of which one assumes access to a model after each
training round. Using these attacks, we estimate subject membership inference
risk on real-world data for single-party models as well as FL scenarios. We
find our attacks to be extremely potent, even without access to exact training
records, and using the knowledge of membership for a handful of subjects. To
better understand the various factors that may influence subject privacy risk
in cross-silo FL settings, we systematically generate several hundred synthetic
federation configurations, varying properties of the data, model design and
training, and the federation itself. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness
of Differential Privacy in mitigating this threat.

describe LegoNN, a procedure for building encoder-decoder architectures with
decoder modules that can be reused across various MT and ASR tasks, without the
need for any fine-tuning. To achieve reusability, the interface between each
encoder and decoder modules is grounded to a sequence of marginal distributions
over a discrete vocabulary pre-defined by the model designer. We present two
approaches for ingesting these marginals; one is differentiable, allowing the
flow of gradients across the entire network, and the other is
gradient-isolating. To enable portability of decoder modules between MT tasks
for different source languages and across other tasks like ASR, we introduce a
modality agnostic encoder which consists of a length control mechanism to
dynamically adapt encoders' output lengths in order to match the expected input
length range of pre-trained decoders. We present several experiments to
demonstrate the effectiveness of LegoNN models: a trained language generation
LegoNN decoder module from German-English (De-En) MT task can be reused with no

ASR model from three modules -- each has been learned within different

obtained by employing a digital servo that stabilizes the EOM DC electric

the fractional frequency instability at the level of about $5\times 10^{-19}$,

shown that the two mechanisms lead to a different behavior in the charge and
the spin conductances, especially when compared to the corresponding
non-superconducting ferromagnet-normal-ferromagnet (F/N/F) junctions. In
particular, when the injected current is perpendicular to the barrier, for high
barrier transparency and large magnetization of the F layers, the large mass
mismatch gives rise to an enhancement of both low-bias charge and spin
conductances of the F/S/F junction, which is not observed in the equal-mass
case. When all the allowed injection directions are considered, the low bias
enhancement of the charge conductance for SMM leads still holds for high
barrier transparency and large magnetization of the F layers. However, in the
case of non-transparent interfaces, spin transport with SMM ferromagnets
exhibits an opposite sign response with respect to the Stoner case at high
biases for all magnetization values, also manifesting a significant
amplification induced by superconductivity at the gap edge. The above mentioned
differences can be exploited to probe the nature of the electronic mechanism

short time inversion recovery, T1-weighted and T2-weighted modalities were
combined into three-channel data to train the network. We achieved segmentation

only two degrees of freedom in the gravity sector. In order to perform this
step we first introduce a precursor theory endowed with a general graviton mass
term, to which, at the level of the Hamiltonian, we add two extra constraints
as to remove the unwanted degrees of freedom, which otherwise would typically
lead to ghosts and/or instabilities. On analyzing the number of independent
constraints and the properties of tensor mode perturbations, we see that the
gravitational waves are the only propagating gravitational degrees of freedom
which do acquire a non-trivial mass, as expected. In order to understand how
the effective gravitational force works for this theory we then investigate
cosmological scalar perturbations in the presence of a pressureless fluid. We
then restrict the whole class of models by imposing the following conditions at
all times: 1) it is possible to define an effective gravitational constant,
$G_{{\rm eff}}$; 2) the value $G_{\text{eff}}/G_{N}$ is always finite but not
always equal to unity (as to allow some non-trivial modifications of gravity,
besides the massive tensorial modes); and 3) the square of mass of the graviton
is always positive. These constraints automatically make also the ISW-effect
contributions finite at all times. Finally we focus on a simple subclass of

this work, we present the first direct measurement of the p$-$p$-$p and
p$-$p$-\Lambda$ systems in terms of three-particle mixed moments carried out
for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. Three-particle cumulants are
extracted from the normalised mixed moments by applying the Kubo formalism,
where the three-particle interaction contribution to these moments can be
isolated after subtracting the known two-body interaction terms. A negative
cumulant is found for the p$-$p$-$p system, hinting to the presence of a
residual three-body effect while for p$-$p$-\Lambda$ the cumulant is consistent
with zero. This measurement demonstrates the accessibility of three-baryon

While only a second-order stationary point $X$ can be provably found in

deficiency certifies it as being globally optimal. This way of certifying
global optimality necessarily requires the search rank $r$ of the current

slows down the convergence of gradient descent, from a linear rate with

(SRSs) against adversarial attacks, raising significant security concerns in
deploying SRSs. However, they considered only a few settings (e.g., some
combinations of source and target speakers), leaving many interesting and
important settings in real-world attack scenarios alone. In this work, we
present AS2T, the first attack in this domain which covers all the settings,
thus allows the adversary to craft adversarial voices using arbitrary source
and target speakers for any of three main recognition tasks. Since none of the
existing loss functions can be applied to all the settings, we explore many
candidate loss functions for each setting including the existing and newly
designed ones. We thoroughly evaluate their efficacy and find that some
existing loss functions are suboptimal. Then, to improve the robustness of AS2T
towards practical over-the-air attack, we study the possible distortions
occurred in over-the-air transmission, utilize different transformation
functions with different parameters to model those distortions, and incorporate
them into the generation of adversarial voices. Our simulated over-the-air
evaluation validates the effectiveness of our solution in producing robust
adversarial voices which remain effective under various hardware devices and
various acoustic environments with different reverberation, ambient noises, and
noise levels. Finally, we leverage AS2T to perform thus far the largest-scale
evaluation to understand transferability among 14 diverse SRSs. The
transferability analysis provides many interesting and useful insights which
challenge several findings and conclusion drawn in previous works in the image
domain. Our study also sheds light on future directions of adversarial attacks

X-Piece, for input word-level distribution shift in NER. Specifically, we
re-tokenize the input words of the source domain to approach the target subword
distribution, which is formulated and solved as an optimal transport problem.
As this approach focuses on the input level, it can also be combined with

planning research. A key part is the representation of action models. Decades
of advances improving declarative action model representations resulted in
numerous theoretical advances, and capable, working, domain-independent
planners. However, despite the maturity of the field, AI planning technology is
still rarely used outside the research community, suggesting that current
representations fail to capture real-world requirements, such as utilizing
complex mathematical functions and models learned from data. We argue that this
is because the modeling process is assumed to have taken place and completed
prior to the planning process, i.e., offline modeling for offline planning.
There are several challenges inherent to this approach, including: limited
expressiveness of declarative modeling languages; early commitment to modeling
choices and computation, that preclude using the most appropriate resolution
for each action model -- which can only be known during planning; and
difficulty in reliably using non-declarative, learned, models.
  We therefore suggest to change the AI planning process, such that is carries
out online modeling in offline planning, i.e., the use of action models that
are computed or even generated as part of the planning process, as they are
accessed. This generalizes the existing approach (offline modeling). The
proposed definition admits novel planning processes, and we suggest one
concrete implementation, demonstrating the approach. We sketch initial results
that were obtained as part of a first attempt to follow this approach by
planning with action cost estimators. We conclude by discussing open
challenges.

switchings, so the inverted hysteresis appears at high temperatures. Usually,
the inverted hysteresis is a fingerprint of material with two independent
magnetic phases, the inversion reflects the phase interaction. First order
reversal curve analysis confirms the two-phase behavior even at the lowest
temperatures of the experiment. While the bulk ferromagnetic magnetization
shows strong temperature dependence, one of the observed phases demonstrates
perfect stability below the Curie temperature. The obtained hysteresis loops
are of the bow-tie type, which is usually ascribed to appearance of the
skyrmionic phase. The described two-phase behavior is mostly identical for
Co3Sn2S2 and Fe3GeTe2 magnetic topological semimetals, only the characteristic
temperatures differ for these materials. The specifics of our experiment is the
excellent temperature stability of the second phase, while the skyrmions are
usually observed near the Curie temperature. On the other hand, temperature
stability can be expected for surface-state induced spin textures due to the
topological protection of surface states in topological semimetals. This also
explains the universal behavior of the second phase for two different
topological semimetals Co3Sn2S2 and FGT. Both these materials have strongly
different bulk properties, the only similarity is the presence of the
topological surface states. Thus, we can ascribe the second, temperature-stable
magnetic phase to the surface states in topological semimetals.

particular, the lack of sufficient scans with artefacts available for training
has created a barrier in designing and deploying machine learning in clinical

components: (1) a set of artefact generators inspired by magnetic resonance
physics to corrupt brain MRI scans and augment a training dataset, (2) a set of
abstract and engineered features to represent images compactly, (3) a feature
selection process that depends on the class of artefact to improve
classification performance, and (4) a set of Support Vector Machine (SVM)
classifiers trained to identify artefacts. Our novel contributions are
threefold: first, we use the novel physics-based artefact generators to
generate synthetic brain MRI scans with controlled artefacts as a data
augmentation technique. This will avoid the labour-intensive collection and
labelling process of scans with rare artefacts. Second, we propose a large pool
of abstract and engineered image features developed to identify 9 different
artefacts for structural MRI. Finally, we use an artefact-based feature
selection block that, for each class of artefacts, finds the set of features
that provide the best classification performance. We performed validation

widely investigated in recent years. The main task of SISR is to recover the
information loss caused by the degradation procedure. According to the Nyquist
sampling theory, the degradation leads to aliasing effect and makes it hard to
restore the correct textures from low-resolution (LR) images. In practice,
there are correlations and self-similarities among the adjacent patches in the
natural images. This paper considers the self-similarity and proposes a
hierarchical image super-resolution network (HSRNet) to suppress the influence
of aliasing. We consider the SISR issue in the optimization perspective, and
propose an iterative solution pattern based on the half-quadratic splitting
(HQS) method. To explore the texture with local image prior, we design a
hierarchical exploration block (HEB) and progressive increase the receptive
field. Furthermore, multi-level spatial attention (MSA) is devised to obtain
the relations of adjacent feature and enhance the high-frequency information,
which acts as a crucial role for visual experience. Experimental result shows
HSRNet achieves better quantitative and visual performance than other works,
and remits the aliasing more effectively.

have enough power to defend against all possible adversarial attacks, and as a

focused on learning an ensemble of neural networks to defend against
adversarial attacks. In this work, we take a principled approach towards
building robust ensembles. We view this problem from the perspective of
margin-boosting and develop an algorithm for learning an ensemble with maximum
margin. Through extensive empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, we show
that our algorithm not only outperforms existing ensembling techniques, but
also large models trained in an end-to-end fashion. An important byproduct of
our work is a margin-maximizing cross-entropy (MCE) loss, which is a better
alternative to the standard cross-entropy (CE) loss. Empirically, we show that
replacing the CE loss in state-of-the-art adversarial training techniques with
our MCE loss leads to significant performance improvement.

road mapping from manufacturing to engineering performance, numerous integrated
computational materials engineering (ICME) models have been developed across a
wide spectrum of length-scales and time-scales to relieve the burden of
resource-intensive experiments. Within the structure-property linkage, crystal
plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) models have been widely used since
they are one of a few ICME toolboxes that allow numerical predictions,
providing the bridge from microstructure to properties and performances.
Several constitutive models have been proposed to capture the mechanics and
plasticity behavior of materials. While some UQ studies have been performed,
the robustness and uncertainty of these constitutive models have not been
rigorously established. In this work, we apply a stochastic collocation (SC)

learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The
algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that
forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token
routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime,
existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution,
namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic
workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation
for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an
identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which
can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any
mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive
parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this
key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques.
Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale --
4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs,
respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that
Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named
SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision
architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x
and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On
effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both
pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object
detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex
for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.

previously collected data without exploration, which shows great promise in
real-world applications when exploration is expensive or even infeasible. The
discount factor, $\gamma$, plays a vital role in improving online RL sample
efficiency and estimation accuracy, but the role of the discount factor in
offline RL is not well explored. This paper examines two distinct effects of
$\gamma$ in offline RL with theoretical analysis, namely the regularization
effect and the pessimism effect. On the one hand, $\gamma$ is a regulator to
trade-off optimality with sample efficiency upon existing offline techniques.
On the other hand, lower guidance $\gamma$ can also be seen as a way of
pessimism where we optimize the policy's performance in the worst possible
models. We empirically verify the above theoretical observation with tabular
MDPs and standard D4RL tasks. The results show that the discount factor plays
an essential role in the performance of offline RL algorithms, both under small
data regimes upon existing offline methods and in large data regimes without
other conservative methods.

vortex crystal. Comparisons are then carried out between the measured
activation energies with the calculated creation energy of the

significantly tighter constraints. Exclusion of the 30 and 44 GHz data, which
give information about synchrotron emission, leads to significant $\tau$

direct evidence of a masculine default in the everyday language of the
English-speaking world. Second, turning to parts-of-speech: the top
male-associated words are typically verbs (e.g., fight, overpower) while the
top female-associated words are typically adjectives and adverbs (e.g., giving,
emotionally). Gender biases in embeddings also permeate parts-of-speech. Third,
for semantic categories: bottom-up, cluster analyses of the top 1,000 words
associated with each gender. The top male-associated concepts include roles and
domains of big tech, engineering, religion, sports, and violence; in contrast,
the top female-associated concepts are less focused on roles, including,
instead, female-specific slurs and sexual content, as well as appearance and
kitchen terms. Fourth, using human ratings of word valence, arousal, and

learned model does not have any physical access to the data. Instead, only a
secured remote access to a data lake is granted to the model owner without any
ability to retrieve data from the data lake. Yet, the model owner may want to
export the trained model periodically from the remote repository and a question
arises whether this may cause is a risk of data leakage. In this paper, we
introduce the concept of data stealing attack during the export of neural
networks. It consists in hiding some information in the exported network that
allows the reconstruction outside the data lake of images initially stored in
that data lake. More precisely, we show that it is possible to train a network
that can perform lossy image compression and at the same time solve some
utility tasks such as image segmentation. The attack then proceeds by exporting
the compression decoder network together with some image codes that leads to
the image reconstruction outside the data lake. We explore the feasibility of
such attacks on databases of CT and MR images, showing that it is possible to
obtain perceptually meaningful reconstructions of the target dataset, and that
the stolen dataset can be used in turns to solve a broad range of tasks.
Comprehensive experiments and analyses show that data stealing attacks should
be considered as a threat for sensitive imaging data sources.

participating peers/clients process their data locally, sharing only updates to
the collaborative model. This enables to build privacy-aware distributed
machine learning models, among others. The goal is the optimization of a
statistical model's parameters by minimizing a cost function of a collection of
datasets which are stored locally by a set of clients. This process exposes the
clients to two issues: leakage of private information and lack of
personalization of the model. On the other hand, with the recent advancements
in various techniques to analyze data, there is a surge of concern for the
privacy violation of the participating clients. To mitigate this, differential
privacy and its variants serve as a standard for providing formal privacy
guarantees. Often the clients represent very heterogeneous communities and hold
data which are very diverse. Therefore, aligned with the recent focus of the FL
community to build a framework of personalized models for the users
representing their diversity, it is also of utmost importance to protect the
clients' sensitive and personal information against potential threats. To
address this goal we consider $d$-privacy, also known as metric privacy, which
is a variant of local differential privacy, using a a metric-based obfuscation
technique that preserves the topological distribution of the original data. To
cope with the issue of protecting the privacy of the clients and allowing for
personalized model training to enhance the fairness and utility of the system,
we propose a method to provide group privacy guarantees exploiting some key
properties of $d$-privacy which enables personalized models under the framework
of FL. We provide theoretical justifications to the applicability and
experimental validation on real datasets to illustrate the working of our
method.

temperatures and magnetic fields. The measurements revealed the emergence of a
long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of uranium magnetic moments below the
N{\'e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$\,=\,45.5\,K and the existence of two easy axes
in the studied compound, namely $b$ and $c$, which correspond to the planes of
the uranium zig-zag chains. Magnetic field applied along these two
crystallographic directions induces in the system a first-order metamagnetic
phase transition (from antiferromagnetism to field-polarized paramagnetism),
and the width of the magnetic hysteresis associated with that transition
reaches as much as 40 kOe at the lowest temperatures. A magnetic phase diagram
developed from the experimental data showed that the metastable region
associated with that magnetic hysteresis forms a funnel that narrows toward the
N{\'e}el point in zero magnetic field. The four-layer Ising model has
successfully predicted the collinear antiferromagnetic structure in
UNi$_{0.34}$Ge$_2$ (known from earlier reports), its magnetic phase diagram,
and temperature and field variations of its magnetization. Moreover, it
suggests that the first-order phase transition extends down to zero magnetic
field, although it is barely detectable in the experiments performed in low
magnetic fields. According to this model, the second-order phase transition
occurs in the compound only in zero field.

competitively and often outperforms the current state-of-the-art across all

from Insight-HXMT help us constrain the power-law component. MAXI J0637-430 is
located at unusually high Galactic latitude; if it belongs to the Galactic
thick disk, we suggest a most likely distance <7 kpc. Compared with other black
hole transients, MAXI J0637-430 is also unusual for other reasons: a fast
transition to the thermal dominant state at the start of the outburst; a low
peak temperature and luminosity (we estimate them at ~ 0.7 keV and <0.1 times
Eddington, respectively); a short decline timescale; a low soft-to-hard
transition luminosity (<0.01 times Eddington). We argue that such properties
are consistent with a small binary separation, short binary period (P ~ 2 hr),
and low-mass donor star (M2 ~ 0.2 M_sun). Moreover, spectral modelling shows
that a single disk-blackbody component is not a good fit to the thermal
emission. Soft spectral residuals, and deviations from the standard L_disk ~
T^4 in relation, suggest the need for a second thermal component. We propose
and discuss various scenarios for such component, in addition to those
presented in previous studies of this source. For example, a gap in the
accretion disk between a hotter inner ring near the innermost stable orbit, and
a cooler outer disk. Another possibility is that the second thermal component
is the thermal plasma emission from an ionized outflow.

non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), it is important to assess their
effects. Human mobility serves as a surrogate for human contacts and compliance
to NPIs. In Nordic countries, NPIs have mostly been advised and sometimes made
mandatory. It is unclear if making NPIs mandatory further reduced mobility.
  Aim: We investigated the effect of non-compulsory and follow-up mandatory
measures in major cities and rural regions on human mobility in Norway. We
identified NPI categories that most affected mobility.
  Methods: We used mobile phone mobility data from the largest Norwegian
operator. We analysed non-compulsory and mandatory measures with before-after
and synthetic difference-in-differences approaches. By regression, we
investigated the impact of different NPIs on mobility.
  Results: Nationally and in less populated regions, follow-up mandatory
measures further decreased time, but not distance travelled. In urban areas,
however, follow-up mandates also decreased distance, and the effect exceeded
that of initial non-compulsory measures. Stricter metre rules, gyms closing and
reopening, restrictions on guests in homes, and face mask recommendations most
impacted distance travelled. Time travelled was most affected by gyms closing
and restaurants and shops reopening.
  Conclusion: Overall, non-compulsory measures appeared to decrease distance
travelled from home, while mandates further decreased this metric in urban
areas. Time travelled is reduced more by mandates than by non-compulsory
measures for all regions and interventions. Stricter distancing and restricted
number of guests were associated with decreases in mobility.

model is inspired by the cubic curvature invariant formed by the contraction of
three Riemann tensors. A combination of Ricci scalar and the cubic invariant is
used to describe the infrared cutoff of the holographic dark energy. Such a
construction is extremely useful since the evolution does not depend on the
past or future features of the universe, but completely on its present
features. Moreover, the use of invariants makes the theory more fundamental in
nature. We have constructed the model and studied its cosmological features.
The analytical solutions of various cosmological parameters such as the density
parameter, equation of state parameter, and deceleration parameter are
extracted and their behaviour is studied. It is seen that the holographic dark
energy model can exhibit the entire thermal history of the universe,
sequentially starting from radiation in the early universe, followed by matter,
and finally the dark energy dominated epoch at late times. The equation of
state parameter shows that the model can exhibit quintessence nature,
phantom-divide crossing, and even phantom nature depending on the choice of

with the help of their respective Siebeck--Marden--Northshield equilateral
triangle and regular tetrahedron. The Vi\`ete trigonometric formulae for the
roots of the cubic are established through the rotation of the triangle by
variation of the free term of the cubic. A very detailed complete root
classification for the quartic $x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ is proposed for
which the conditions are imposed on the individual coefficients $a$, $b$, $c$,
and $d$. The maximum and minimum lengths of the interval containing the four
real roots of the quartic are determined in terms of $a$ and $b$. The upper and
lower root bounds for a quartic with four real roots are also found: no root
can lie farther than $(\sqrt{3}/4)\sqrt{3a^2 - 8b}\, $ from $-a/4$. The real
roots of the quartic are localized by finding intervals containing at most two
roots. The end-points of these intervals depend on $a$ and $b$ and are roots of
quadratic equations -- which makes this localization helpful for quartic
equations with complicated parametric coefficients.

bidders have complex preferences over bundles of goods. However, the behavior
of bidders under different payment rules is not well understood, and there has
been limited success in finding Bayes-Nash equilibria of such auctions due to
the computational difficulties involved. In this paper, we introduce
non-decreasing payment rules. Under such a rule, the payment of a bidder cannot
decrease when he increases his bid, which is a natural and desirable property.
VCG-nearest, the payment rule most commonly used in practice, violates this
property and can thus be manipulated in surprising ways. In contrast, we show
that many other payment rules are non-decreasing. We also show that a
non-decreasing payment rule imposes a structure on the auction game that
enables us to search for an approximate Bayes-Nash equilibrium much more
efficiently than in the general case. Finally, we introduce the utility planes
BNE algorithm, which exploits this structure and outperforms a state-of-the-art
algorithm by multiple orders of magnitude.

the unprecedented ability of these artificial neural networks (ANNs) to capture

black-boxes with limited interpretability. Interpretability, however, is a
multi-faceted construct that is used differently across fields. In particular,
interpretability, or explainability, efforts in Artificial Intelligence (AI)
focus on understanding how different model components contribute to its output
(i.e., decision making). In contrast, the neuroscientific interpretability of
ANNs requires explicit alignment between model components and neuroscientific
constructs (e.g., different brain areas or phenomena, like recurrence or
top-down feedback). Given the widespread calls to improve the interpretability
of AI systems, we here highlight these different notions of interpretability
and argue that the neuroscientific interpretability of ANNs can be pursued in
parallel with, but independently from, the ongoing efforts in AI. Certain ML
techniques (e.g., deep dream) can be leveraged in both fields, to ask what
stimulus optimally activates the specific model features (feature visualization
by optimization), or how different features contribute to the model's output
(feature attribution). However, without appropriate brain alignment, certain

semi-Lagrangian advection schemes require meteorological data such as wind,

high-resolution data has been obtained by interpolating the meteorological
parameters from the gridded data of a meteorological model or reanalysis, e.g.
using linear interpolation in space and time. However, interpolation errors are
a large source of error for these models. Reducing them requires meteorological
input fields with high space and time resolution, which may not always be
available and can cause severe data storage and transfer problems. Here, we
interpret this problem as a single image superresolution task. We interpret
meteorological fields available at their native resolution as low-resolution
images and train deep neural networks to up-scale them to higher resolution,
thereby providing more accurate data for Lagrangian models. We train various
versions of the state-of-the-art Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for
Superresolution on low-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data with the goal to
up-scale these data to arbitrary spatial resolution. We show that the resulting

measured by reconstructing a curved muon path using a strong magnetic field and
muon trackers. Alternatively, a time-of-flight and Cherenkov ring imager are
less frequently applied, especially when there is a need to avoid a magnetic
field. However, measurement resolution is much less than that of magnetic
spectrometers, approximately 20% whereas it is nearly 4% or less when using
magnets and trackers. Here, we propose a different paradigm to estimate muon
momentum that utilizes multiple pressurized gas Cherenkov radiators. Using the
fact that the refractive index of gas medium varies depending on its pressure
and temperature, we can optimize the muon Cherenkov threshold momentum levels
for which a muon signal will be detected. In this work, we demonstrate that
muon momentum can be estimated with mean resolution of {sigma_p}/p < 20% and
mean classification rate of 90.08% in the momentum range of 0.1 to 10.0 GeV/c
by analyzing optical photon signals from each Cherenkov radiator. We anticipate

model-based algorithm with similar theoretical guarantees as CS methods. The
proposed iterative algorithm alternates between a gradient descent involving
the score function and a conjugate gradient algorithm to encourage data
consistency. The score function is modeled as a monotone convolutional neural
network. Our analysis shows that the monotone constraint is necessary and
sufficient to enforce the uniqueness of the fixed point in arbitrary inverse

which is robust to input perturbations. We introduce two implementations of the
proposed MOL framework, which differ in the way the monotone property is
imposed. The first approach enforces a strict monotone constraint, while the
second one relies on an approximation. The guarantees are not valid for the
second approach in the strict sense. However, our empirical studies show that
the convergence and robustness of both approaches are comparable, while the
less constrained approximate implementation offers better performance. The

learning embeddings for entities and relations, then employing them to predict
new relations among the entities. Despite their aggrandizement, most of those

mechanisms can improve entities' context representation and how combining
entities and semantic path contexts improves the general representation of

need to pave the way for supporting astronauts during their sojourn. This will
also be achieved by providing broadband and low-latency connectivity through
wireless network infrastructures. In such a framework, we propose a Martian
deployment of a 3-Dimensional (3D) network acting as Cloud Radio Access Network
(C-RAN). The scenario consists, mostly, of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
nanosatellites. Thanks to the thin Martian atmosphere, CubeSats can stably
orbit at very-low-altitude. This allows to meet strict delay requirements to
split functions of the baseband processing between drones and CubeSats. The
detailed analytical study, presented in this paper, confirmed the viability of
the proposed 3D architecture, under some constraints and trade-off concerning
the involved Space communication infrastructures, that are discussed in detail.

  Smart Grid","2023 North American Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference",,,,"cs.NI cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Smart grid (SG) systems enhance grid resilience and efficient operation,
leveraging the bidirectional flow of energy and information between generation
facilities and prosumers. For energy demand management (EDM), the SG network
requires computing a large amount of data generated by massive
Internet-of-things sensors and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) with
minimal latency. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
resource allocation scheme in a 6G-enabled SG edge network to offload
resource-consuming EDM computation to edge servers. Automatic resource
provisioning is achieved by harnessing the computational capabilities of smart
meters in the dynamic edge network. To enforce DRL-assisted policies in dense
6G networks, the state information from multiple edge servers is required.
However, adversaries can ""poison"" such information through false state
injection (FSI) attacks, exhausting SG edge computing resources. Toward
addressing this issue, we investigate the impact of such FSI attacks with
respect to abusive utilization of edge resources, and develop a lightweight FSI
detection mechanism based on supervised classifiers. Simulation results
demonstrate the efficacy of DRL in dynamic resource allocation, the impact of
the FSI attacks, and the effectiveness of the detection technique.

Wigner quasi-probability distribution (WQD) will manifest an entanglement

Schr\""{o}dinger equation for a free particle with TDEM is solved with the help
of Lewis-Riesenfeld phase space invariant method. WQD for the system of two

  Experts: A Multi-Task Learning Approach",,,,,"q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quantitative investment is a fundamental financial task that highly relies on
accurate stock prediction and profitable investment decision making. Despite
recent advances in deep learning (DL) have shown stellar performance on
capturing trading opportunities in the stochastic stock market, we observe that
the performance of existing DL methods is sensitive to random seeds and network
initialization. To design more profitable DL methods, we analyze this
phenomenon and find two major limitations of existing works. First, there is a
noticeable gap between accurate financial predictions and profitable investment
strategies. Second, investment decisions are made based on only one individual
predictor without consideration of model uncertainty, which is inconsistent
with the workflow in real-world trading firms. To tackle these two limitations,
we first reformulate quantitative investment as a multi-task learning problem.
Later on, we propose AlphaMix, a novel two-stage mixture-of-experts (MoE)
framework for quantitative investment to mimic the efficient bottom-up trading
strategy design workflow of successful trading firms. In Stage one, multiple
independent trading experts are jointly optimized with an individual
uncertainty-aware loss function. In Stage two, we train neural routers
(corresponding to the role of a portfolio manager) to dynamically deploy these
experts on an as-needed basis. AlphaMix is also a universal framework that is
applicable to various backbone network architectures with consistent
performance gains. Through extensive experiments on long-term real-world data
spanning over five years on two of the most influential financial markets (US
and China), we demonstrate that AlphaMix significantly outperforms many
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four financial criteria.

(EMA) is essential for corporate or companies because corporate sectors are the
main parties of environmental humiliation as they are existed in the
environment and for protecting environment a branch of accounting is emerged
which is called environmental management accounting. The objective of the study
is to develop a compliance framework for EMA and appraise the ER practices in
selected industries in Bangladesh. In conducting the study, 50 environmental
sensitive industries were selected from DSE. A compliance checklist was
developed on 75 aspects of EMA and ER under 13 groups. In developing the
compliance index binary method is used i.e. 1= if ER practices; 0= if not
practices. Further the level of EMR/ER practices have been evaluated in terms
of selected independent variables of the company viz. total assets, total
sales, return on equity and size of board. The study found that the
environmental management accounting in the manufacturing companies is in poor
level. The maximum compliance is 67% and the lowest is 20%. The TA, TS BS and
SP have been considered to find out the explanatory variables. In most of the
cases board size does not play significant role in the practice of EMA in the
sampled firms.

UNi_4B}$, constructing a localized pseudo triplet crystalline-electric field
model. For a long time, its low-temperature symmetry-broken phase in ${\rm
UNi_4B}$ has been considered to be a magnetic toroidal order forming
atomic-scale vortices lattice with disordered sites at each center of the
vortices. However, recent observation of current-induced magnetizations offers
a reinvestigation about the validity of this order parameter because of the
contradiction in their anisotropy. Our model takes into account the quadrupole
degrees of freedom, whose importance is recently evidenced by the
sound-velocity softening. We find that the quadrupole moments play an important
role in determining the magnetic structure in the ordered states. For a wide
range of parameter space, we obtain two triple-$\mathcal{Q}$ magnetic orders in
our 36-site mean-field analysis: toroidal order and another one with the same
number of disordered sites as in the toroidal order. We name the latter
``triforce'' order after its magnetic structure. Importantly, the triforce
order possesses exactly the same spin structure factor as the toroidal order
does, while the phase factors in the superposition of the triple-$\mathcal{Q}$
structure are different. We show that the triforce order is consistent with the
observed current-induced magnetization when the realistic crystal structure of
${\rm UNi_4B}$ is taken into account. We compare the predictions of the
triforce order with the experimental data available at present in detail and
also discuss possible applications of the present mechanism of
triple-$\mathcal{Q}$ orders to anisotropic correlated systems.
