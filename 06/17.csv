representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining
techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,
ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations
among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the
structure of the graph) to allow target nodes to evade detection or degenerate
the classification performance of the detection. In this paper, we exploit this
vulnerability by designing the structural poisoning attacks to a FeXtra-based
GAD system termed OddBall as well as the black box attacks against GCN-based
GAD systems by attacking the imbalanced lienarized GCN ( LGCN ). Specifically,
we formulate the attack against OddBall and LGCN as a one-level optimization
problem by incorporating different regression techniques, where the key
technical challenge is to efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain.
We propose a novel attack method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient
descent. Comparing to prior arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient
information, making it particularly suitable for solving discrete optimization
problems, thus opening the door to studying a new type of attack against
security analytic tools that rely on graph data.

  Paraphrase Quality Detection for Algebraic Word Problems","Accepted as a full paper at ECML-PKDD'22, 26 Pages",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces the novel task of scoring paraphrases for Algebraic
Word Problems (AWP) and presents a self-supervised method for doing so. In the
current online pedagogical setting, paraphrasing these problems is helpful for
academicians to generate multiple syntactically diverse questions for
assessments. It also helps induce variation to ensure that the student has
understood the problem instead of just memorizing it or using unfair means to
solve it. The current state-of-the-art paraphrase generation models often
cannot effectively paraphrase word problems, losing a critical piece of
information (such as numbers or units) which renders the question unsolvable.
There is a need for paraphrase scoring methods in the context of AWP to enable
the training of good paraphrasers. Thus, we propose ParaQD, a self-supervised
paraphrase quality detection method using novel data augmentations that can
learn latent representations to separate a high-quality paraphrase of an
algebraic question from a poor one by a wide margin. Through extensive
experimentation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by up to 32% while also demonstrating
impressive zero-shot performance.

  Denoising Score Matching","Accepted in ICML 2022",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Score-based generative models have excellent performance in terms of
generation quality and likelihood. They model the data distribution by matching
a parameterized score network with first-order data score functions. The score
network can be used to define an ODE (""score-based diffusion ODE"") for exact
likelihood evaluation. However, the relationship between the likelihood of the
ODE and the score matching objective is unclear. In this work, we prove that
matching the first-order score is not sufficient to maximize the likelihood of
the ODE, by showing a gap between the maximum likelihood and score matching
objectives. To fill up this gap, we show that the negative likelihood of the
ODE can be bounded by controlling the first, second, and third-order score
matching errors; and we further present a novel high-order denoising score
matching method to enable maximum likelihood training of score-based diffusion
ODEs. Our algorithm guarantees that the higher-order matching error is bounded
by the training error and the lower-order errors. We empirically observe that
by high-order score matching, score-based diffusion ODEs achieve better
likelihood on both synthetic data and CIFAR-10, while retaining the high
generation quality.

that whenever a trajectory hypercontractivity condition holds, the risk of the
least-squares estimator on dependent data matches the iid rate order-wise after
a burn-in time. In comparison, many existing results in learning from dependent
data have rates where the effective sample size is deflated by a factor of the

Furthermore, our results allow the covariate process to exhibit long range

this phenomenon learning with little mixing, and present several examples for
when it occurs: bounded function classes for which the $L^2$ and
$L^{2+\epsilon}$ norms are equivalent, ergodic finite state Markov chains,
various parametric models, and a broad family of infinite dimensional

about population treatment effect on patient survival from clustered and
censored survival data while accounting for the multilevel data structure. The
practical utility of this tool goes beyond the estimation of population average
treatment effect. In this work, we exposit how riAFT-BART can be used to solve
two important statistical questions with clustered survival data: estimating
the treatment effect heterogeneity and variable selection. Leveraging the
likelihood-based machine learning, we describe a way in which we can draw
posterior samples of the individual survival treatment effect from riAFT-BART
model runs, and use the drawn posterior samples to perform an exploratory
treatment effect heterogeneity analysis to identify subpopulations who may
experience differential treatment effects than population average effects. We
propose a permutation based approach using the predictor's variable inclusion
proportion supplied by the riAFT-BART model for variable selection. To address
the missing data issue frequently encountered in health databases, we propose a
strategy to combine bootstrap imputation and riAFT-BART for variable selection
among incomplete clustered survival data. We conduct an expansive simulation
study to examine the practical operating characteristics of our proposed
methods, and provide empirical evidence that our proposed methods perform
better than several existing methods across a wide range of data scenarios.
Finally, we demonstrate the methods via a case study of predictors for
in-hospital mortality among severe COVID-19 patients and estimating the
heterogeneous treatment effects of three COVID-specific medications. The
methods developed in this work are readily available in the R package

of the evolution of the disease. The applicability of learning-based methods
could automate this task efficiently. However, the lack of annotated
longitudinal data with new-appearing lesions is a limiting factor for the
training of robust and generalizing models. In this work, we describe a
deep-learning-based pipeline addressing the challenging task of detecting and
segmenting new MS lesions. First, we propose to use transfer-learning from a
model trained on a segmentation task using single time-points. Therefore, we
exploit knowledge from an easier task and for which more annotated datasets are
available. Second, we propose a data synthesis strategy to generate realistic
longitudinal time-points with new lesions using single time-point scans. In
this way, we pretrain our detection model on large synthetic annotated
datasets. Finally, we use a data-augmentation technique designed to simulate
data diversity in MRI. By doing that, we increase the size of the available
small annotated longitudinal datasets. Our ablation study showed that each
contribution lead to an enhancement of the segmentation accuracy. Using the
proposed pipeline, we obtained the best score for the segmentation and the
detection of new MS lesions in the MSSEG2 MICCAI challenge.

to realize near-term quantum advantages in meaningful tasks, including machine
learning and combinatorial optimization. When applied to tasks involving
classical data, such algorithms generally begin with quantum circuits for data
encoding and then train quantum neural networks (QNNs) to minimize target
functions. Although QNNs have been widely studied to improve these algorithms'
performance on practical tasks, there is a gap in systematically understanding
the influence of data encoding on the eventual performance. In this paper, we
make progress in filling this gap by considering the common data encoding
strategies based on parameterized quantum circuits. We prove that, under
reasonable assumptions, the distance between the average encoded state and the
maximally mixed state could be explicitly upper-bounded with respect to the
width and depth of the encoding circuit. This result in particular implies that
the average encoded state will concentrate on the maximally mixed state at an
exponential speed on depth. Such concentration seriously limits the
capabilities of quantum classifiers, and strictly restricts the
distinguishability of encoded states from a quantum information perspective. We
further support our findings by numerically verifying these results on both
synthetic and public data sets. Our results highlight the significance of
quantum data encoding in machine learning tasks and may shed light on future
encoding strategies.

former is characterized by an effective bulk driving force $\Delta\tilde{f}$
which increases with decreasing temperature, while the latter manifests itself
through a balance of interfacial energies captured by the contact angle
$\theta$. The simulated morphologies, namely, core-shell, Janus and inverse
core-shell, cluster into distinct regions of the $\Delta\tilde{f}$-$\theta$
space. Variation of $\theta$ with $\Delta\tilde{f}$ in the Ag-Cu alloy system
is computed as a function of temperature using a CALPHAD approach in which
surface energies are estimated from a modified Butler equation. This
$\theta-\Delta\tilde{f}$ trajectory for Ag-Cu, when superimposed on the
morphology map, enables the prediction of different morphological transitions
as a function of temperature. Therefore, the study establishes a unique
thermodynamic framework coupled with phase-field simulations for predicting and
tailoring nanoparticle morphology through a variation of processing
temperature.

exploring various architectural options such as centralized and zonal
architectures for their numerous benefits. Zonal architecture reduces the
wiring cost by physically locating related operations and ECUs near their
intended functions and the number of physical ECUs through function
consolidation. Centralized architectures consolidate the number of ECUs into
few, powerful compute units. Common characteristics of these architectures
include the need for high-bandwidth communication and security, which have been
elusive with standard automotive architectures. Further, as automotive
communication technologies evolve, it is also likely that multiple link-layer
technologies such as CAN and Automotive Ethernet will co-exist. These
alternative architectures promise to integrate these diverse sets of
technologies. However, architectures that allow such co-existence have not been
adequately explored.
  In this work we explore a new network architecture called Named Data
Networking (NDN) to achieve multiple goals: provide a foundational security
infrastructure and bridge different link layer protocols such as CAN, LIN, and
automotive Ethernet into a unified communication system.
  We created a proof-of-concept bench-top testbed using CAN HATS and Raspberry
PIs that replay real traffic over CAN and Ethernet to demonstrate how NDN can
provide a secure, high-speed bridge between different automotive link layers.
We also show how NDN can support communication between centralized or zonal
high-power compute components. Security is achieved through digitally signing
all Data packets between these components, preventing unauthorized ECUs from
injecting arbitrary data into the network. We also demonstrate NDN's ability to
prevent DoS and replay attacks between different network segments connected
through NDN.

the paper, such a description is obtained but up to isomorphism of algebraic

  Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic. The aim
of the paper is to give a classification (up to isomorphism) of the set of

ideal $x^mK[x]$ for some $m\geq 1$. It is proven that the set $\mathcal{A} =

who have been shown to face bias in AI implementations. While there has been
significant work on analysing and mitigating algorithmic bias, the broader
mechanisms of how bias emerges in AI applications are not well understood,
hampering efforts to address bias where it begins. In this article, we
illustrate how bias in AI-assisted decision making can arise from a range of
specific design decisions, each of which may seem self-contained and
non-biasing when considered separately. These design decisions include basic
problem formulation, the data chosen for analysis, the use the AI technology is
put to, and operational design elements in addition to the core algorithmic
design. We draw on three historical models of disability common to different
decision-making settings to demonstrate how differences in the definition of
disability can lead to highly distinct decisions on each of these aspects of
design, leading in turn to AI technologies with a variety of biases and
downstream effects. We further show that the potential harms arising from
inappropriate definitions of disability in fundamental design stages are
further amplified by a lack of transparency and disabled participation
throughout the AI design process. Our analysis provides a framework for
critically examining AI technologies in decision-making contexts and guiding
the development of a design praxis for disability-related AI analytics. We put

engineering complexities involved, there is a need for holistically
benchmarking the processor to have quality assurance. Linear cross-entropy
benchmarking (XEB) has been used extensively for systems with $50$ or more
qubits but is fundamentally limited in scale due to the exponentially large
computational resources required for classical simulation. In this work we
propose conducting linear XEB with Clifford circuits, a scheme we call Clifford
XEB. Since Clifford circuits can be simulated in polynomial time, Clifford XEB
can be scaled to much larger systems. To validate this claim, we run numerical
simulations for particular classes of Clifford circuits with noise and observe
exponential decays. When noise levels are low, the decay rates are
well-correlated with the noise of each cycle assuming a digital error model. We
perform simulations of systems up to 1,225 qubits, where the classical
processing task can be easily dealt with by a workstation. Furthermore, using
the theoretical guarantees in Chen et al. (arXiv:2203.12703), we prove that
Clifford XEB with our proposed Clifford circuits must yield exponential decays
under a general error model for sufficiently low errors. Our theoretical
results explain some of the phenomena observed in the simulations and shed
light on the behavior of general linear XEB experiments.

challenging problem, as even small-time scales yield on the order of a hundred
thousand samples. With the recent advent of Transformers, neural architectures
became good at modeling dependencies over longer time scales, but they suffered
from quadratic constraints to scale them. We propose a generative
auto-regressive architecture that can model audio waveforms over quite a large
context, greater than 500,000 samples. Our work is adapted to learn time
dependencies by learning a latent representation by a CNN front-end, and then
learning dependencies over these representations using Transformer encoders,
fully trained end-to-end: thereby allowing to learn representations as it deems
fit for the next sample. Unlike previous works that compared different time
scales to show improvement, we use a standard dataset, with the same number of
parameters/context to show improvements. We achieve a state-of-the-art
performance as compared to other approaches such as Wavenet, SaSHMI, and
Sample-RNN on a standard dataset for modeling long-term structure. This work
gives very exciting direction for the field, given improvements in context
modeling that can be scaled with more data, as well as potentially better
results by using billions/trillions of parameters.

this paper, we propose FocalConvNet, a focal modulation network integrated with
lightweight convolutional layers for the classification of small bowel
anatomical landmarks and luminal findings. FocalConvNet leverages focal
modulation to attain global context and allows global-local spatial
interactions throughout the forward pass. Moreover, the convolutional block
with its intrinsic inductive/learning bias and capacity to extract hierarchical

throughput. We compare our FocalConvNet with other SOTA on Kvasir-Capsule, a
large-scale VCE dataset with 44,228 frames with 13 classes of different
anomalies. Our proposed method achieves the weighted F1-score, recall and MCC}

likely that one sub-class (CEMP-$s$ stars) is tied to mass-transfer events in
binary stars, while another sub-class (CEMP-no stars) are enriched by the
nucleosynthetic yields of the first generations of stars. Previous studies of
CEMP stars have primarily concentrated on the Galactic halo, but more recently
they have also been detected in the thick disk and bulge components of the
Milky Way. $Gaia$ DR3 has provided an unprecedented sample of over 200 million
low-resolution ($R\approx$ 50) spectra from the BP and RP photometers. Training
on the CEMP catalog from the SDSS/SEGUE database, we use XGBoost to identify
the largest all-sky sample of CEMP candidate stars to date. In total, we find
58,872 CEMP star candidates, with an estimated contamination rate of 12%. When
comparing to literature high-resolution catalogs, we positively identify 60-68%
of the CEMP stars in the data, validating our results and indicating a high
completeness rate. Our final catalog of CEMP candidates spans from the inner to
outer Milky Way, with distances as close as $r \sim$ 0.8 kpc from the Galactic
center, and as far as $r >$ 30 kpc. Future higher-resolution spectroscopic
follow-up of these candidates will provide validations of their classification
and enable investigations of the frequency of CEMP-$s$ and CEMP-no stars
throughout the Galaxy, to further constrain the nature of their progenitors.

  economics literature of tug-of-war",,,,"math.PR cs.GT econ.TH math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a
graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of
a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a
fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an
amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have
independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on
resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend
precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine
the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias
game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war
games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget
which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each
turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the
sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary
being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a
single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique
Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any
given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been
placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained
at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic
function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given
turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of
game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different
form in the non-leisurely game.

collectively enhanced or suppressed, akin to Dicke super- and sub-radiance,
depending on the interatomic separation and the initial correlations between
the atoms. In particular, the interference properties of the collective beats
are determined by the distance between the atoms modulo the beat wavelength. We
study the collective atomic and field dynamics, illustrating a crossover from a
Markovian to a non-Markovian regime as the atomic separation becomes
sufficiently large to bring memory effects of the electromagnetic environment
into consideration. In such a non-Markovian regime, collective quantum beats
can be enhanced beyond the Markovian limit as a result of retardation effects.
Our results demonstrate the rich interplay between multilevel and multiatom
quantum interference effects arising in a system of distant quantum emitters.

Here, we present an approach to not only generate histological images that

provide a user ability to generate new and rare morphologies. Our approach
involves developing a generative adversarial network model that synthesizes
pathology images constrained by class labels. We investigated the ability of
this framework in synthesizing realistic prostate and colon tissue images and
assessed the utility of these images in augmenting diagnostic ability of
machine learning methods as well as their usability by a panel of experienced

similar to real data in training a deep learning model for diagnosis.
Pathologists were not able to distinguish between real and synthetic images and
showed a similar level of inter-observer agreement for prostate cancer grading.

  Knowledge","26 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) for image classification are known to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. And, the adversarial examples have
transferability, which means an adversarial example for a DNN model can fool
another black-box model with a non-trivial probability. This gave birth of the
transfer-based adversarial attack where the adversarial examples generated by a
pretrained or known model (called surrogate model) are used to conduct
black-box attack. There are some work on how to generate the adversarial
examples from a given surrogate model to achieve better transferability.
However, training a special surrogate model to generate adversarial examples
with better transferability is relatively under-explored. In this paper, we
propose a method of training a surrogate model with abundant dark knowledge to
boost the adversarial transferability of the adversarial examples generated by
the surrogate model. This trained surrogate model is named dark surrogate model
(DSM), and the proposed method to train DSM consists of two key components: a
teacher model extracting dark knowledge and providing soft labels, and the
mixing augmentation skill which enhances the dark knowledge of training data.
Extensive experiments have been conducted to show that the proposed method can
substantially improve the adversarial transferability of surrogate model across
different architectures of surrogate model and optimizers for generating
adversarial examples. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to
other scenarios of transfer-based attack that contain dark knowledge, like face
verification.

good performance, they involve an autoregressive (AR) decoder to generate
tokens one by one, which is computationally inefficient. To speed up inference,
non-autoregressive (NAR) methods, e.g. single-step NAR, were designed, to
enable parallel generation. However, due to an independence assumption within
the output tokens, performance of single-step NAR is inferior to that of AR
models, especially with a large-scale corpus. There are two challenges to
improving single-step NAR: Firstly to accurately predict the number of output
tokens and extract hidden variables; secondly, to enhance modeling of
interdependence between output tokens. To tackle both challenges, we propose a
fast and accurate parallel transformer, termed Paraformer. This utilizes a
continuous integrate-and-fire based predictor to predict the number of tokens
and generate hidden variables. A glancing language model (GLM) sampler then
generates semantic embeddings to enhance the NAR decoder's ability to model
context interdependence. Finally, we design a strategy to generate negative
samples for minimum word error rate training to further improve performance.
Experiments using the public AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2 benchmark, and an
industrial-level 20,000 hour task demonstrate that the proposed Paraformer can
attain comparable performance to the state-of-the-art AR transformer, with more
than 10x speedup.

interested in whether a winning strategy exists for the pursuers or the
evaders, or the game will draw. When the anchors are stationary, we show an

  The primary motivation for this study is to explore the boundaries between
kinematic and dynamic constraints. In particular, whether the solution of the
kinematic problem can be used to speed up the search for the problems with
dynamic constraints and how to discretize the problem to utilize such relations
best. In this work, we show that a geometric branch-and-bound type of approach

offers the possibility to model the dynamical behaviour of a docking mechanism

the bispectrum monopole to higher wavenumbers thanks to the one-loop

reduces the error bars with respect to our original analysis of the power
spectrum at one loop and bispectrum monopole at tree level. After fixing the
spectral tilt to Planck preferred value and using a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
prior, we measure $\sigma_8=0.794\pm 0.037$, $h = 0.692\pm 0.011$, and
$\Omega_m = 0.311\pm 0.010$ to about $4.7\%$, $1.6\%$, and $3.2\%$, at $68\%$

is to evade the no-go theorem that states that, simultaneously maintaining the
observational bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the non-Gaussian scalar
spectrum is not possible. Furthermore, constructing the bouncing phase leads to
numerous instabilities such as gradient, ghost, and so on. Most importantly,
the model fails to be an attractor, in general, meaning that the solution
heavily depends on the initial conditions, resulting in anisotropic (BKL)
instability in the system. In this paper, using conformal transformation, we
construct a classical bouncing model from a non-minimal slow-roll inflationary
model. As a result of the conformal transformation, we show that the model is
free of the above instabilities and that it leads to a smooth transition from
bouncing to the traditional reheating scenario. We also look at the dynamical
analysis of the system in the presence of a barotropic fluid and discover that
there exists a wide range of model parameters that allow the model to avoid the
BKL instability, making it a viable alternative to inflationary dynamics.

challenging task as the network needs to sieve relevant patterns from spurious

achieved through heavy data augmentation, large-scale datasets and prohibitive
amounts of compute. Video self-supervised learning (SSL) suffers from added
challenges: video datasets are typically not as large as image datasets,
compute is an order of magnitude larger, and the amount of spurious patterns

learning self-supervised representations from video data might result in
sub-optimal performance. To address this, we propose to utilize a strong
image-based model, pre-trained with self- or language supervision, in a video

paper, AI-based deep learning techniques are applied to D2D links operating at
5.8 GHz with the aim at providing potential answers to the following questions
concerning the prediction of the received signal strength variations: i) how
effective is the prediction as a function of the coherence time of the channel?
and ii) what is the minimum number of input samples required for a target
prediction performance? To this end, a variety of measurement environments and
scenarios are considered, including an indoor open-office area, an outdoor
open-space, line of sight (LOS), non-LOS (NLOS), and mobile scenarios. Four
deep learning models are explored, namely long short-term memory networks
(LSTMs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
and dense or feedforward networks (FFNs). Linear regression is used as a
baseline model. It is observed that GRUs and LSTMs present equivalent
performance, and both are superior when compared to CNNs, FFNs and linear
regression. This indicates that GRUs and LSTMs are able to better account for
temporal dependencies in the D2D data sets. We also provide recommendations on
the minimum input lengths that yield the required performance given the channel
coherence time. For instance, to predict 17 and 23 ms into the future, in
indoor and outdoor LOS environments, respectively, an input length of 25 ms is
recommended. This indicates that the bulk of the learning is done within the
coherence time of the channel, and that large input lengths may not always be

formulate a multi-agent image reference game where a (trained) speaker model is
rewarded for describing a target image such that one (pretrained) listener

To adapt, the speaker must exploit differences in the knowledge it shares with
the different listeners. We show that finetuning an attention-based adapter
between a CLIP vision encoder and a large language model in this contrastive,
multi-agent setting gives rise to context-dependent natural language
specialization from rewards only, without direct supervision. Through
controlled experiments, we show that training a speaker with two listeners that
perceive differently, using our method, allows the speaker to adapt to the
idiosyncracies of the listeners. Furthermore, we show zero-shot transfer of the
specialization to real-world data. Our experiments demonstrate a method for
specializing grounded language models without direct supervision and highlight
the interesting research challenges posed by complex multi-agent communication.

relativistic degrees of freedom of the plasma. The latter results in
significant corrections to the evolution equations for the heavy neutrinos and
the lepton asymmetry that have been previously ignored in the literature. We
show the importance of these corrections to accurately describe the dynamical

abundance of collective modes in the spin and valley isospin channels of

experiments. However, direct observation of collective excitations has remained
elusive due to the lack of a spin probe. In this work, we use a
resistively-detected electron spin resonance technique to look for low-energy
collective excitations in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. We report
direct observation of collective modes in the form of microwave-induced
resonance near half filling of the moir\'e flatbands. The frequency-magnetic
field dependence of these resonance modes sheds light onto the nature of
intervalley spin coupling, allowing us to extract parameters such as
intervalley exchange interaction and spin stiffness. Two independent
observations testify that the generation and detection of the microwave
resonance relies on the strong correlation within the flat moir\'e energy band.
First, the onset of robust resonance response coincides with the spontaneous
flavor polarization at half moir\'e filling, and remains absent in the density
range where the underlying Fermi surface is isospin unpolarized. Second, we
performed the same resonance measurement on graphene monolayer and bilayer
samples, including twisted bilayer with a large twist angle, where flatband
physics is absent. We observe no indication of resonance response in these
samples across a large range of carrier density, microwave frequency and power.
A natural explanation is that the resonance response near the magic angle
originates from ""Dirac revivals"" and the resulting isospin order.

numerical methods of stellar evolution and radiation hydrodynamics. To this
end, a grid of evolutionary tracks was calculated for stars with masses on the
main sequence $1M_\odot\le M_\textrm{ZAMS}\le 2.2M_\odot$ and metallicity
$Z=0.01$. Selected models of AGB evolutionary sequences were used for
determination of the initial conditions and the time--dependent inner boundary
conditions for the equations of hydrodynamics describing evolutionary changes
in the radially pulsating star. The onset of period decrease during the initial
stage of the thermal pulse is shown to nearly coincide with the peak
helium-burning luminosity. The most rapid decrease of the period occurs during
the first three decades. The pulsation period decreases due to both contraction
of the star and mode switching from the fundamental mode to the first overtone.
The time-scale of mode switching is of the order of a few dozen pulsation
cycles. The present-day model of the Mira-type variable T UMi is the
first-overtone pulsator with small-amplitude semi-regular oscillations.
Theoretical estimates of the pulsation period at the onset of period decrease
and the rate of period change three decades later are shown to agree with

problem. To tackle it, recent developments in the machine learning (ML)
literature on heterogeneous treatment effect estimation gave rise to many
sophisticated, but opaque, tools: due to their flexibility, modularity and
ability to learn constrained representations, neural networks in particular
have become central to this literature. Unfortunately, the assets of such black
boxes come at a cost: models typically involve countless nontrivial operations,
making it difficult to understand what they have learned. Yet, understanding
these models can be crucial -- in a medical context, for example, discovered
knowledge on treatment effect heterogeneity could inform treatment prescription
in clinical practice. In this work, we therefore use post-hoc feature
importance methods to identify features that influence the model's predictions.
This allows us to evaluate treatment effect estimators along a new and
important dimension that has been overlooked in previous work: We construct a
benchmarking environment to empirically investigate the ability of personalized
treatment effect models to identify predictive covariates -- covariates that
determine differential responses to treatment. Our benchmarking environment
then enables us to provide new insight into the strengths and weaknesses of
different types of treatment effects models as we modulate different challenges

from extreme-view images is a longstanding challenge in computer vision.
Prevailing 3D reconstruction algorithms often adopt the image matching paradigm
and presume that a portion of the scene is co-visible across images, yielding
poor performance when there is little overlap among inputs. In contrast, humans
can associate visible parts in one image to the corresponding invisible
components in another image via prior knowledge of the shapes. Inspired by this
fact, we present a novel concept called virtual correspondences (VCs). VCs are
a pair of pixels from two images whose camera rays intersect in 3D. Similar to
classic correspondences, VCs conform with epipolar geometry; unlike classic
correspondences, VCs do not need to be co-visible across views. Therefore VCs
can be established and exploited even if images do not overlap. We introduce a
method to find virtual correspondences based on humans in the scene. We
showcase how VCs can be seamlessly integrated with classic bundle adjustment to
recover camera poses across extreme views. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose estimation methods in
challenging scenarios and is comparable in the traditional densely captured
setup. Our approach also unleashes the potential of multiple downstream tasks
such as scene reconstruction from multi-view stereo and novel view synthesis in
extreme-view scenarios.

$\mathcal{O}(n^2d^2)$ for Hessian observations. Beyond canonical kernel

turned on/off over the span of ~3 minutes (time difference between the dual

Combined with the substantial and negative follow-up efforts, these
observations limit the allowed range of signal repeat schedules, to the extent
that one might question the credibility of the signal itself. Previous work has
largely excluded the hypothesis of a strictly periodic repeating source, for
periods shorter than 40 hours. However, a non-periodic, stochastic repeater
remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ a likelihood emulator using the Big
Ear observing logs to infer the probable signal properties under this
hypothesis. We find that the maximum a-posteriori solution has a likelihood of
32.3%, highly compatible with the Big Ear data, with a broad 2 $\sigma$
credible interval of signal duration 72 secs < T < 77 mins and mean repeat rate
0.043 1/days < $\lambda$ < 59.8 1/days. We extend our analysis to include 192
hours of subsequent observations from META, Hobart and ATA, which drops the
peak likelihood to 1.78%, and thus in tension with the available data at the
2.4 $\sigma$ level. Accordingly, the Wow signal cannot be excluded as a
stochastic repeater with available data, and we estimate that 62 days of
accumulated additional observations would be necessary to surpass 3 $\sigma$

limiting mass-loss scenarios: (1) an ""eruption"" arising from shock break-out
following impulsive energy deposition below the stellar surface; (2) a steady
""wind"" due to sustained heating of the progenitor envelope. The eruption model,
which resembles a scaled-down version of Type IIP SNe, can explain the
luminosities and timescales of well-sampled precursors, for ejecta masses $\sim
0.1-1\,M_{\odot}$ and velocities $\sim 100-1000\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. By contrast,
the steady-wind scenario cannot explain the highest precursor luminosities
$\gtrsim10^{41}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, under the constraint that the total ejecta
mass not exceed the entire progenitor mass (though the less-luminous SN 2020tlf

compact ($\lesssim10^{15}$ cm) optically-thick CSM at the time of core

processes and environmental conditions. The details of how these evolve and
couple together is not fully understood yet. In this work, we study the effects
that galaxy mergers and morphological transformations have on setting different
modes of star formation at galactic scales and across cosmic time. We monitor
the global properties of VINTERGATAN, a 20 pc resolution cosmological zoom-in
simulation of a Milky Way-type galaxy. Between redshifts 1 and 5, we find that
major mergers trigger multiple starburst episodes, corresponding to a tenfold
drop of the gas depletion time down to 100 Myr. Bursty star formation is
enabled by the emergence of a galactic disc, when the rotational velocity of
gas starts to dominate over its velocity dispersion. Coherent motions of gas
then outweigh disordered ones, such that the galaxy responds to merger-induced
forcings by redistributing large amounts of gas towards high densities. As a
result, the overall star formation rate is enhanced with an associated decrease
in the depletion time. Before redshift 5, mergers are expected to be even more
frequent. However, a more turbulent interstellar medium, is incapable of
reacting in such a collective manner so as to spark rapid star formation. Thus,
a constant long depletion time of 1 Gyr is kept, along with a low, but
gradually increasing star formation rate. After the last major merger at
redshift 1, VINTERGATAN spends the next 8 Gyr evolving secularly. It has a
settled and adiabatically growing disc, and a constant star formation rate with
gas depletion times of 1-2 Gyr. Our results are compatible with the observed
rapid transition between different modes of star formation when galaxies leave
the main sequence.

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we test here a recent model of
non-resonant particle acceleration in strongly magnetized
turbulence~\cite{2021PhRvD.104f3020L}, which ascribes the energization of
particles to their continuous interaction with the random velocity flow of the
turbulence, in the spirit of the original Fermi model. To do so, we compare,
for a large number of particles that were tracked in the simulations, the
predicted and the observed histories of particles momenta. The predicted
history is that derived from the model, after extracting from the simulations,
at each point along the particle trajectory, the three force terms that control
acceleration: the acceleration of the field line velocity projected along the
field line direction, its shear projected along the same direction, and its
transverse compressive part. Overall, we find a clear correlation between the
model predictions and the numerical experiments, indicating that this
non-resonant model can successfully account for the bulk of particle
energization through Fermi-type processes in strongly magnetized turbulence. We
also observe that the parallel shear contribution tends to dominate the physics
of energization in the PIC simulations, while in the MHD incompressible
simulation, both the parallel shear and the transverse compressive term provide
about equal contributions.

planetary systems. Ideal planets for such research are in coeval associations,
where the parent population can precisely determine their ages. We describe a
young association (MELANGE-3) in the Kepler field, which harbors two transiting
planetary systems (Kepler-1928 and Kepler-970). We identify MELANGE-3 by
searching for kinematic and spatial overdensities around Kepler planet hosts
with high levels of lithium. To determine the age and membership of MELANGE-3,
we combine new high-resolution spectra with archival light curves, velocities,
and astrometry of stars near Kepler-1928 spatially and kinematically. We use
the resulting rotation sequence, lithium levels, and color-magnitude diagram of
candidate members to confirm the presence of a coeval $105\pm$10 Myr

For the two exoplanet systems, we revise the stellar and planetary parameters,
taking into account the newly-determined age. Fitting the 4.5 yr Kepler light

19.58-day orbit, while Kepler-970 b is a $2.8\pm0.2R_\oplus$ planet on a
16.73-day orbit. Kepler-1928 was previously flagged as an eclipsing binary,
which we rule out using radial velocities from APOGEE and statistically
validate the signal as planetary in origin. Given its overlap with the Kepler
field, MELANGE-3 is valuable for studies of spot evolution on year timescales,
and both planets contribute to the growing work on transiting planets in young
stellar associations.

Recently, strategies have emerged to drastically alter electronic and magnetic

coherently engineering optical properties on demand are far less understood.
Here we demonstrate coherent control and giant modulation of optical
nonlinearity in a van der Waals layered magnetic insulator, manganese
phosphorus trisulfide (MnPS$_3$). By driving far off-resonance from the lowest
on-site manganese $d$-$d$ transition, we observe a coherent on-off switching of
its optical second harmonic generation efficiency on the timescale of 100
femtoseconds with no measurable dissipation. At driving electric fields of the
order of 10$^9$ volts per metre, the on-off ratio exceeds 10, which is limited
only by the sample damage threshold. Floquet theory calculations based on a
single-ion model of MnPS$_3$ are able to reproduce the measured driving field
amplitude and polarization dependence of the effect. Our approach can be
applied to a broad range of insulating materials and could lead to dynamically

use this fact, together with the pure spinor superfield formalism, to study
supermultiplets in six dimensions, starting from vector bundles on projective

supertranslation algebra form a line bundle over the nilpotence variety; one
can think of such multiplets as being those whose holomorphic twists have rank
one over Dolbeault forms on spacetime. In addition, we explicitly construct
multiplets associated to natural higher-rank equivariant vector bundles,
including the tangent and normal bundles as well as their duals. Among the
multiplets constructed are the vector multiplet and hypermultiplet, the family
of $\mathcal{O}(n)$-multiplets, and the supergravity and gravitino multiplets.
Along the way, we tackle various theoretical problems within the pure spinor
superfield formalism. In particular, we give some general discussion about the
relation of the projective nilpotence variety to multiplets and prove general
results on short exact sequences and dualities of sheaves in the context of the

between the sign of the torques acting on the planet and the parameter $K'$
(which describes the depth of the gap carved by the planet in the disc). We
perform `live-planet' simulations exploring a range of $K'$ and disc mass
values to test and extend these results. The excitation of planet eccentricity
in live-planet simulations breaks the direct dependence of migration rate (rate
of change of semi-major axis) on the torques imposed, an effect that
`fixed-planet' simulations cannot treat. By disentangling the contribution to
the torque due to the semi-major axis evolution from that due to the
eccentricity evolution, we recover the relation between the magnitude and sign
of migration and $K'$ and argue that this relation may be better expressed in
terms of the related gap depth parameter $K$. We present a toy model in which
the sign of planetary migration changes at a limiting value of $K$, through
which we explore planets' migration in viscously evolving discs. The existence
of the torque reversal shapes the planetary system's architecture by
accumulating planets either at the stalling radius or in a band around it
(defined by the interplay between the planet migration and the disc evolution).
In either case, planets pile up in the area $1-10$ au, disfavouring hot Jupiter
formation through Type II migration in the planet-dominated regime.

learning models. Feature selection techniques can be divided into two
categories: filter and wrapper methods. While wrapper methods commonly result
in strong predictive performances, they suffer from a large computational
complexity and therefore take a significant amount of time to complete,
especially when dealing with high-dimensional feature sets. Alternatively,
filter methods are considerably faster, but suffer from several other
disadvantages, such as (i) requiring a threshold value, (ii) not taking into
account intercorrelation between features, and (iii) ignoring feature
interactions with the model. To this end, we present powershap, a novel wrapper
feature selection method, which leverages statistical hypothesis testing and
power calculations in combination with Shapley values for quick and intuitive
feature selection. Powershap is built on the core assumption that an
informative feature will have a larger impact on the prediction compared to a
known random feature. Benchmarks and simulations show that powershap
outperforms other filter methods with predictive performances on par with
wrapper methods while being significantly faster, often even reaching half or a
third of the execution time. As such, powershap provides a competitive and
quick algorithm that can be used by various models in different domains.
Furthermore, powershap is implemented as a plug-and-play and open-source
sklearn component, enabling easy integration in conventional data science
pipelines. User experience is even further enhanced by also providing an
automatic mode that automatically tunes the hyper-parameters of the powershap
algorithm, allowing to use the algorithm without any configuration needed.

location privacy are monolithic and do not allow users to customize their
obfuscation range. This can lead to the user being mapped in undesirable
locations (e.g., shady neighborhoods) to the location-requesting services.
Modifying the obfuscation function generated by a centralized server on the
user side can result in poor privacy as the original function is not robust
against such updates. Users themselves might find it challenging to understand
the parameters involved in obfuscation mechanisms (e.g., obfuscation range and
granularity of location representation) and therefore struggle to set realistic
trade-offs between privacy, utility, and customization. In this paper, we
propose a new framework called, CORGI, i.e., CustOmizable Robust
Geo-Indistinguishability, which generates location obfuscation functions that
are robust against user customization while providing strong privacy guarantees
based on the Geo-Indistinguishability paradigm. CORGI utilizes a tree
representation of a given region to assist users in specifying their privacy
and customization requirements. The server side of CORGI takes these
requirements as inputs and generates an obfuscation function that satisfies
Geo-Indistinguishability requirements and is robust against customization on
the user side. The obfuscation function is returned to the user who can then
choose to update the obfuscation function (e.g., obfuscation range, granularity
of location representation). The experimental results on a real dataset
demonstrate that CORGI can efficiently generate obfuscation matrices that are
more robust to the customization by users.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs), is generally believed to be the key step in
regulating star formation in massive galaxies. As the fuel of star formation,
the cold gas reservoir is a direct probe of the effect of AGN feedback on their
host galaxies. However, in observation, no clear connection has been found
between AGN activity and the cold gas mass. In this paper, we find
observational signals of significant depletion of the total neutral hydrogen
gas reservoir in optically-selected type-2 AGN host central galaxies of stellar
mass $10^{9}$--$10^{10}M_\odot$. The effect of AGN feedback on the cold gas
reservoir is stronger for higher star formation rates and higher AGN
luminosity. But it becomes much weaker above this mass range, consistent with
previous findings focusing on massive galaxies. Our result suggests that
low-mass and gas-rich AGN host central galaxies would first form dense cores
before AGN feedback is triggered, removing their neutral hydrogen gas. More
massive central galaxies may undergo a significantly different formation
scenario by gradually building up dense cores with less effective and recurrent
AGN feedback.

spoils the expected hierarchy between the bulk and the throat mass scales and
implies that the energy scale of the uplift is larger than the species scale of
the effective theory in the throat. Moreover it requires an unnaturally large
tadpole $N\sim 10^{7-8}$ that is certainly in conflict with tadpole
cancellation. For the less restricted second scenario, the hierarchy can be
controlled at the expense of, under the most optimistic assumptions, an only
moderately large tadpole $N\sim 10^{2-3}$.

selecting which objective (accuracy or fairness) to optimize at each step. We
introduce the L2T-FMT algorithm that is a teacher-student network trained

teacher instructs the student to learn from either accuracy or fairness,
depending on what is harder to learn for each task. Moreover, this dynamic
selection of which objective to use at each step for each task reduces the
number of trade-off weights from 2T to T, where T is the number of tasks. Our

subsequent discussion ensuing in the post's replies. In this paper, we propose
DRAGNET++, which aims to predict the intensity of hatred that a tweet can bring
in through its reply chain in the future. It uses the semantic and propagating
structure of the tweet threads to maximize the contextual information leading
up to and the fall of hate intensity at each subsequent tweet. We explore three

statistical inference, since the computation of normalisation constants
requires summation over large or possibly infinite sets, which can be
impractical. This paper addresses this computational challenge through the
development of a novel generalised Bayesian inference procedure suitable for
discrete intractable likelihood. Inspired by recent methodological advances for
continuous data, the main idea is to update beliefs about model parameters
using a discrete Fisher divergence, in lieu of the problematic intractable
likelihood. The result is a generalised posterior that can be sampled using
standard computational tools, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, circumventing
the intractable normalising constant. The statistical properties of the
generalised posterior are analysed, with sufficient conditions for posterior
consistency and asymptotic normality established. In addition, a novel and
general approach to calibration of generalised posteriors is proposed.
Applications are presented on lattice models for discrete spatial data and on
multivariate models for count data, where in each case the methodology
facilitates generalised Bayesian inference at low computational cost.

have emerged as promising candidates for predicting peak human object
recognition performance and neural activity. However, modeling the temporal
dimension i.e., the speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT), is essential for them to
serve as useful computational models for how humans recognize objects. To this
end, we here present the first large-scale (148 observers, 4 neural networks, 8

images. In each human trial, a beep, indicating the desired reaction time,
sounds at a fixed delay after the image is presented, and observer's response
counts only if it occurs near the time of the beep. In a series of blocks, we
test many beep latencies, i.e., reaction times. We observe that human accuracy
increases with reaction time and proceed to compare its characteristics with
the behavior of several dynamic neural networks that are capable of
inference-time adaptive computation. Using FLOPs as an analog for reaction
time, we compare networks with humans on curve-fit error, category-wise

synthesis, capable of representing diffuse, refractive and highly reflective
surfaces, 2) disentangling skin and eye appearance from environmental
illumination such that it may be rendered under novel lighting conditions, and
3) capturing eyeball motion and the deformation of the surrounding skin to
enable re-gazing. These challenges have traditionally necessitated the use of
expensive and cumbersome capture setups to obtain high-quality results, and
even then, modeling of the eye region holistically has remained elusive. We
present a novel geometry and appearance representation that enables
high-fidelity capture and photorealistic animation, view synthesis and
relighting of the eye region using only a sparse set of lights and cameras. Our
hybrid representation combines an explicit parametric surface model for the
eyeball with implicit deformable volumetric representations for the periocular
region and the interior of the eye. This novel hybrid model has been designed
to address the various parts of that challenging facial area - the explicit
eyeball surface allows modeling refraction and high-frequency specular
reflection at the cornea, whereas the implicit representation is well suited to
model lower-frequency skin reflection via spherical harmonics and can represent
non-surface structures such as hair or diffuse volumetric bodies, both of which
are a challenge for explicit surface models. We show that for high-resolution
close-ups of the eye, our model can synthesize high-fidelity animated gaze from
novel views under unseen illumination conditions.

understanding strongly correlated electron materials, yet existing methods
struggle to simultaneously reach zero temperature and infinite system size. The
\textit{de facto} standard is to approximate a finite dimension multi-orbital
Hubbard model with a $d=\infty$ version, which can then be formally solved via
the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), though the DMFT solution is limited by
the state of unbiased impurity solvers for zero temperature and multiple
orbitals. The recently developed variational discrete action theory (VDAT)
offers a new approach to solve the $d=\infty$ Hubbard model, with a variational
ansatz that is controlled by an integer $\mathcal{N}$, and monotonically
approaches the exact solution at an increasing computational cost. Here we
propose a decoupled minimization algorithm to implement VDAT for the
multi-orbital Hubbard model in $d=\infty$ and study $\mathcal{N}=2-4$ . At
$\mathcal{N}=2$, VDAT rigorously recovers the multi-orbital Gutzwiller
approximation, reproducing known results. At $\mathcal{N}=3$, VDAT precisely
captures the competition between the Hubbard $U$, Hund $J$, and crystal field
$\Delta$ in the two orbital Hubbard model over all parameter space, with a
negligible computational cost. For sufficiently large $U/t$ and $J/U$, we show
that $\Delta$ drives a first-order transition within the Mott insulating
regime. In the large orbital polarization limit with finite $J/U$, we find that
interactions have a nontrivial effect even for small $U/t$. VDAT will have far
ranging implications for understanding multi-orbital model Hamiltonians and
strongly correlated electron materials.

distributional change. With sequentially observed data, a decision maker needs
to declare whether changes have already occurred to the streams at each time

so that its future data will no longer be collected. This is a compound
decision problem in the sense that the decision maker may want to optimize
certain compound performance metrics that concern all the streams as a whole.
Thus, the decisions are not independent for different streams. Our contribution
is three-fold. First, we propose a general framework for compound performance
metrics that includes the ones considered in the existing works as special
cases and introduces new ones that connect closely with the performance metrics
for single-stream sequential change detection and large-scale hypothesis

and established its existence in the setting of finite state and action spaces.
However, many substantive applications (including two of the three motivating

depends critically on Radon-Nikodym derivatives, which are necessarily bounded

explainability literature) is to vary each individual feature (while keeping
the others fixed) and use the resulting change in disparity to quantify its

challenging for classification models as they may end up biased towards the
majority class. A promising approach among the ensemble-based methods in the
context of imbalance learning is Dynamic Selection (DS). DS techniques single
out a subset of the classifiers in the ensemble to label each given unknown
sample according to their estimated competence in the area surrounding the
query. Because only a small region is taken into account in the selection
scheme, the global class disproportion may have less impact over the system's
performance. However, the presence of local class overlap may severely hinder
the DS techniques' performance over imbalanced distributions as it not only
exacerbates the effects of the under-representation but also introduces
ambiguous and possibly unreliable samples to the competence estimation process.
Thus, in this work, we propose a DS technique which attempts to minimize the
effects of the local class overlap during the classifier selection procedure.
The proposed method iteratively removes from the target region the instance
perceived as the hardest to classify until a classifier is deemed competent to
label the query sample. The known samples are characterized using instance
hardness measures that quantify the local class overlap. Experimental results
show that the proposed technique can significantly outperform the baseline as
well as several other DS techniques, suggesting its suitability for dealing
with class under-representation and overlap. Furthermore, the proposed
technique still yielded competitive results when using an under-sampled, less
overlapped version of the labelled sets, specially over the problems with a
high proportion of minority class samples in overlap areas. Code available at

Ohmic H-mode triggering by the electrode biasing, fueling and momentum

experimental studies of Geodesic Acoustic Mode (GAM) and zonal flows had been
performed in STOR-M tokamak. The GAM experiments strongly require collection of
fluctuations data from different Langmuir probes installed at different
poloidal locations, but on the same magnetic surfaces. This is need of the
adjustment of radial locations between discharges. It is therefore important to
analyze and visualize the features of all probe data quickly during discharges.
For this purpose, a Python code has been developed and used for quick analyze

through clustering. Specifically, we encode semantics into the keypoints by
teaching them to reconstruct images from a sparse set of keypoints and their

false positives for the primary screening procedure for one of five cancers or
six sexually transmitted diseases. We use these data to estimate the
probability that an individual in one of 14 demographic subpopulations will
receive at least one false positive for one of these eleven diseases in a

quantify the uncertainty surrounding our estimates. The estimated probability
of receiving at least one false positive in a lifetime is 85.5% ($\pm$0.9%) and
38.9% ($\pm$3.6%) for baseline groups of women and men, respectively. It is
higher for subpopulations recommended to screen more frequently than the
baseline, including more vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and men who

remain inevitable. The high lifetime risk of a false positive reveals the

the presence of dynamical instabilities over long timescales, and the emergence

derived values of localized horizontal shear and Ld may constrain FFR formation

a variety of vision tasks and are being used as an alternative to CNNs. Their
design is based on a self-attention mechanism that processes images as a
sequence of patches, which is quite different compared to CNNs. Hence it is
interesting to study if ViTs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor
attacks happen when an attacker poisons a small part of the training data for
malicious purposes. The model performance is good on clean test images, but the
attacker can manipulate the decision of the model by showing the trigger at
test time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that ViTs are
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. We also find an intriguing difference between
ViTs and CNNs - interpretation algorithms effectively highlight the trigger on
test images for ViTs but not for CNNs. Based on this observation, we propose a
test-time image blocking defense for ViTs which reduces the attack success rate
by a large margin. Code is available here:

computing (CC) environments to devices on the edge, where data can be collected
by streamlined computing devices that are physically near instruments of
interest, has garnered tremendous interest in recent years. Such edge computing
environments can operate on data in-situ instead of requiring the collection of
data in HPC and/or CC facilities, offering enticing benefits that include
avoiding costs of transmission over potentially unreliable or slow networks,
increased data privacy, and real-time data analysis. Before such benefits can
be realized at scale, new fault tolerances approaches must be developed to
address the inherent unreliability of edge computing environments, because the
traditional approaches used by HPC and CC are not generally applicable to edge
computing. Those traditional approaches commonly utilize checkpoint-and-restart
and/or redundant-computation strategies that are not feasible for edge
computing environments where data storage is limited and synchronization is
costly. Motivated by prior algorithm-based fault tolerance approaches, an
asynchronous Jacobi (ASJ) variant is developed herein with resilience to data
corruption by leveraging existing convergence theory. The ASJ variant rejects
solution approximations from neighbor devices if the distance between two
successive approximations violates an analytic bound. Numerical results show
the ASJ variant restores convergence in the presence of certain types of

temporal spacing ranging from days to years. We classify most sources as
beamed, extragalactic radio sources; the catalog also includes several radio
galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, and Galactic and Magellanic Cloud sources,
including H IIi regions and planetary nebulae. An advanced extraction method
applied directly to the multifrequency Planck time-ordered data, rather than
the mission sky maps, was developed to allow an assessment of the variability
of polarized sources. Our analysis of the time-ordered data from the Planck
mission, tod2flux, allowed us to catalog the time-varying emission and
polarization properties for these sources at the full range of polarized
frequencies employed by Planck, 30 to 353 GHz. PCCS-PV provides the time- and
frequency-dependent, polarized flux densities for all 153 sources. To
illustrate some potential applications of the PCCS- PV, we conducted
preliminary comparisons of our measurements of selected sources with published

between the Planck and the Institut de Radioastronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM)

closely similar epochs. These combined measurements also show the value of
PCCS-PV results and the PCCS2 catalog for filling in missing spectral (or

extragalactic sources. In turn, these results provide useful clues as to the
physical properties of the sources.

the performance across classes since they typically overfit the model to the
latest task. In our work, we propose to address these challenges with the
introduction of a novel methodology of Tangent Kernel for Incremental Learning

representations across classes and balances the accuracy for each class, and as
such achieves better overall accuracy and variance. TKIL approach is based on
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which describes the convergence behavior of neural
networks as a kernel function in the limit of infinite width. In TKIL, the
gradients between feature layers are treated as the distance between the
representations of these layers and can be defined as Gradients Tangent Kernel
loss (GTK loss) such that it is minimized along with averaging weights. This
allows TKIL to automatically identify the task and to quickly adapt to it

methods need to accommodate target domains with different temporal dynamics and
be capable of doing so without seeing any target examples during pre-training.

by TF-C, we define a decomposable pre-training model, where the self-supervised
signal is provided by the distance between time and frequency components, each
individually trained by contrastive estimation. We evaluate the new method on
eight datasets, including electrodiagnostic testing, human activity
recognition, mechanical fault detection, and physical status monitoring.
Experiments against eight state-of-the-art methods show that TF-C outperforms
baselines by 15.4% (F1 score) on average in one-to-one settings (e.g.,
fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model on EMG data) and by 8.4% (precision) in
challenging one-to-many settings (e.g., fine-tuning an EEG-pretrained model for
either hand-gesture recognition or mechanical fault prediction), reflecting the

unsupervised approach for discovering articulated motions in a part-segmented

closure: any valid articulation of an object's parts should keep the object in
the same semantic category (e.g. a chair stays a chair). We operationalize this
concept with an algorithm that optimizes a shape's part motion parameters such
that it can transform into other shapes in the collection. We evaluate our
approach by using it to re-discover part motions from the PartNet-Mobility

parameters have low error with respect to ground truth annotations,
outperforming two supervised motion prediction methods.

($\sim$0.1 pc) to clump/cloud scales ($\sim$1-10 pc). The proportion of
proto-clusters containing hub-filament systems decreases with increasing dust
temperature ($T_d$) and luminosity-to-mass ratios ($L/M$) of clumps, indicating
that stellar feedback from H{\sc ii} regions gradually destroys the
hub-filament systems as proto-clusters evolve. Clear velocity gradients are
seen along the longest filaments with a mean velocity gradient of 8.71 km
s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$ and a median velocity gradient of 5.54 km s$^{-1}$pc$^{-1}$.
We find that velocity gradients are small for filament lengths larger than
$\sim$1~pc, probably hinting at the existence of inertial inflows, although we
cannot determine whether the latter are driven by large-scale turbulence or
large-scale gravitational contraction. In contrast, velocity gradients below
$\sim$1~pc dramatically increase as filament lengths decrease, indicating that
the gravity of the hubs or cores starts to dominate gas infall at small scales.
We suggest that self-similar hub-filament systems and filamentary accretion at
all scales may play a key role in high-mass star formation.

injecting a backdoor in the training phase, the adversary could control model

However, we highlight two issues in previous backdoor learning evaluations: (1)
The differences between real-world scenarios (e.g. releasing poisoned datasets
or models) are neglected, and we argue that each scenario has its own
constraints and concerns, thus requires specific evaluation protocols; (2) The
evaluation metrics only consider whether the attacks could flip the models'
predictions on poisoned samples and retain performances on benign samples, but
ignore that poisoned samples should also be stealthy and semantic-preserving.
To address these issues, we categorize existing works into three practical
scenarios in which attackers release datasets, pre-trained models, and
fine-tuned models respectively, then discuss their unique evaluation
methodologies. On metrics, to completely evaluate poisoned samples, we use
grammar error increase and perplexity difference for stealthiness, along with
text similarity for validity. After formalizing the frameworks, we develop an

mechanical multi-line spinning LiDARs, which have become increasingly popular
in autonomous driving recently. However, there are several challenges for these
new LiDAR sensors, including severe motion distortions, small field of view and
sparse point cloud, which hinder them from being widely used in LiDAR odometry.
To tackle these problems, we present an effective continuous-time LiDAR
odometry (ECTLO) method for the Risley prism-based LiDARs with non-repetitive
scanning patterns. To account for the noisy data, a filter-based point-to-plane
Gaussian Mixture Model is used for robust registration. Moreover, a LiDAR-only
continuous-time motion model is employed to relieve the inevitable distortions.
To facilitate the implicit data association in parallel, we maintain all map
points within a single range image. Extensive experiments have been conducted
on various testbeds using the solid-state LiDARs with different scanning
patterns, whose promising results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
approach.

uncertainty, where an action is sampled from a carefully prescribed
distribution which is updated based on the observed data. In this work, we
study the problem of adaptive control of stabilizable linear-quadratic
regulators (LQRs) using TS, where the system dynamics are unknown. Previous
works have established that $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ frequentist regret is optimal
for the adaptive control of LQRs. However, the existing methods either work
only in restrictive settings, require a priori known stabilizing controllers,
or utilize computationally intractable approaches. We propose an efficient TS
algorithm for the adaptive control of LQRs, TS-based Adaptive Control, TSAC,
that attains $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, even for multidimensional systems,
thereby solving the open problem posed in Abeille and Lazaric (2018). TSAC does
not require a priori known stabilizing controller and achieves fast
stabilization of the underlying system by effectively exploring the environment
in the early stages. Our result hinges on developing a novel lower bound on the
probability that the TS provides an optimistic sample. By carefully prescribing
an early exploration strategy and a policy update rule, we show that TS
achieves order-optimal regret in adaptive control of multidimensional
stabilizable LQRs. We empirically demonstrate the performance and the
efficiency of TSAC in several adaptive control tasks.

different speakers' single-talker audio segments as the reference speech. The
latter one employs both the mixed audio and reference speech as inputs, and
then it generates an estimated mask. By exploiting the TSVAD decision and the
estimated mask, our SD-MTSS model can extract the speech of each speaker
concurrently in a conversion recording without additional enrollment audio in

However, a quantitative characterization of how SMI itself and estimation rates

the dependence of SMI on dimension, under a broader framework termed $k$-SMI,
which considers projections to $k$-dimensional subspaces. Using a new result on
the continuity of differential entropy in the 2-Wasserstein metric, we derive
sharp bounds on the error of Monte Carlo (MC)-based estimates of $k$-SMI, with
explicit dependence on $k$ and the ambient dimension, revealing their interplay
with the number of samples. We then combine the MC integrator with the neural

optimal convergence rates are established. We also explore asymptotics of the

with a residual that decays under appropriate moment bounds. All our results
trivially apply to SMI by setting $k=1$. Our theory is validated with numerical

up to Markov equivalence, and for the purpose of causal inference, it is useful
to learn a graphical representation of the Markov equivalence class (MEC). In
this paper, we revisit the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algorithm, which is
widely cited as a score-based algorithm for learning the MEC of the underlying
causal structure. We observe that in order to make the GES algorithm consistent
in a nonparametric setting, it is not necessary to design a scoring metric that
evaluates graphs. Instead, it suffices to plug in a consistent estimator of a
measure of conditional dependence to guide the search. We therefore present a
reframing of the GES algorithm, which is more flexible than the standard
score-based version and readily lends itself to the nonparametric setting with
a general measure of conditional dependence. In addition, we propose a neural
conditional dependence (NCD) measure, which utilizes the expressive power of
deep neural networks to characterize conditional independence in a
nonparametric manner. We establish the optimality of the reframed GES algorithm
under standard assumptions and the consistency of using our NCD estimator to
decide conditional independence. Together these results justify the proposed
approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in

magnetic skyrmions coupled to a thermal background of magnetic fluctuations.
Upon promoting the skyrmion's collective coordinate $\boldsymbol{R}$ to a
dynamic variable and integrating out the magnonic heat bath, we derive the
generalized equation of motion for $\boldsymbol{R}$ with a non-local damping
term that describes a steady-state skyrmion dynamics at finite temperatures.
Being essentially temperature dependent, the intrinsic damping is shown to
originate from the coupling of thermally activated magnon modes to the
adiabatic potential driven by a rigid skyrmion motion, which can be regarded as
another manifestation of emergent electrodynamics inherent to topological
magnetic textures. We further argue that the diagonal components of the damping
term act as the source of dissipation and inertia, while its off-diagonal
components modify the gyrotropic motion of a magnetic skyrmion. By means of
numerical calculations for the lattice spin model of chiral ferromagnets, we
study the temperature behavior of the intrinsic damping as a function of
magnetic field in periodic and confined geometries. The intrinsic damping is
demonstrated to be highly non-local, revealing its quantum-mechanical nature,
that becomes more pronounced with increasing temperature. At high temperatures
when the magnon occupation factors are large, the intrinsic damping is shown to
yield a modified Thiele's equation with the additional non-local dissipative
and mass terms that exhibit an almost linear temperature behavior. Our results
provide a microscopic background for semiclassical magnetization dynamics and

attractive candidate for such purpose because of its magnetometric sensitivity,
stability and compatibility with ambient conditions. However, the existing NV
center-based magnetometers have limited sensitivity in the microwave band. Here
we present a continuous heterodyne detection method that can enhance the
sensor's response to weak microwaves, even in the absence of spin controls.
Experimentally, we achieve a sensitivity of 8.9 pT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ for
microwaves of 2.9 GHz by simultaneously using an ensemble of $n_{\text{NV}}
\sim 2.8\times10^{13}$ NV centers within a sensor volume of $4\times10^{-2}$

trap lighter interstellar particles that pass nearby with small relative
velocities onto temporarily-bound orbits. The capture mechanism is driven by
the Galactic tidal field, which can decelerate infalling objects to a degree
where their binding energy becomes negative. Over time, trapped particles build
a local overdensity -- or `halo'-- that reaches a steady state as the number of
particles being captured equals that being tidally stripped. This paper uses
classical stochastic techniques to calculate the capture rate and the
phase-space distribution of particles trapped by a point-mass. In a steady
state, bound particles generate a density enhancement that scales as
$\delta(r)\sim r^{-3/2}$ (a.k.a `density spike') and follow a velocity
dispersion profile $\sigma_h(r)\sim r^{-1/2}$. Collisionless $N$-body
experiments show excellent agreement with these theoretical predictions within
a distance range $r\gtrsim r_\epsilon$, where $r_\epsilon\simeq
0.8\,\exp[-V_\star^2/(2\sigma^2)]\,Gm_\star/\sigma^2$ is the thermal critical
radius of a point-mass $m_\star$ moving with a speed $V_\star$ through a sea of
particles with a velocity dispersion $\sigma$. Preliminary estimates that
ignore collisions with planets and Galactic substructures suggest that the
solar system may be surrounded by a halo that contains the order of $N^{\rm

a dark matter mass of $M^{\rm DM}(<0.1\,{\rm pc})\sim 10^{-13}M_\odot$. The
presence of trapped interstellar matter in the solar system can affect current
estimates on the size of the Oort Cloud, and leave a distinct signal in direct

real-world applications. Recently, a GNN design principle of model
depth-receptive field decoupling has been proposed to address the well-known
issue of neighborhood explosion. Decoupled GNN models achieve higher accuracy
than original models and demonstrate excellent scalability for mini-batch
inference.
  We map Decoupled GNNs onto CPU-FPGA heterogeneous platforms to achieve
low-latency mini-batch inference. On the FPGA platform, we design a novel GNN
hardware accelerator with an adaptive datapath denoted Adaptive Computation
Kernel (ACK) that can execute various computation kernels of GNNs with
low-latency: (1) for dense computation kernels expressed as matrix
multiplication, ACK works as a systolic array with fully localized connections,
(2) for sparse computation kernels, ACK follows the scatter-gather paradigm and
works as multiple parallel pipelines to support the irregular connectivity of
graphs. The proposed task scheduling hides the CPU-FPGA data communication
overhead to reduce the inference latency. We develop a fast design space
exploration algorithm to generate a single accelerator for multiple target GNN
models. We implement our accelerator on a state-of-the-art CPU-FPGA platform
and evaluate the performance using three representative models (GCN, GraphSAGE,

$21.4-50.8\times$, $2.9-21.6\times$, $4.7\times$ latency reduction compared

The objective is to update the weights of CLs iteratively to learn a

large-margin discriminant model represented by support vectors based on such a
representation. The advantage of the proposed approach w.r.t. convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) is two-fold. First, it allows representation learning
with a small amount of data due to the reduced number of parameters compared to
an equivalent CNN. Second, it has a low training cost since the backpropagation
considers only support vectors. The experimental results on texture and

lose angular momentum to their magnetized stellar winds. The rate of angular
momentum loss depends on the strength and morphology of the magnetic field, the
mass-loss rate, and the stellar rotation period, mass, and radius. Previous
observations suggested a shift in magnetic morphology between two F-type stars
with similar rotation rates but very different ages (88 Leo and rho CrB). In
this Letter, we identify a comparable transition in an evolutionary sequence of
solar analogs with ages between 2-7 Gyr. We present new spectropolarimetry of
18 Sco and 16 Cyg A & B from the Large Binocular Telescope, and we reanalyze
previously published Zeeman Doppler images of HD 76151 and 18 Sco, providing
additional constraints on the nature and timing of this transition. We combine
archival X-ray observations with updated distances from Gaia to estimate
mass-loss rates, and we adopt precise stellar properties from asteroseismology
and other sources. We then calculate the wind braking torque for each star in
the evolutionary sequence, demonstrating that the rate of angular momentum loss
drops by more than an order of magnitude between the ages of HD 76151 and 18
Sco (2.6-3.7 Gyr) and continues to decrease modestly to the age of 16 Cyg A & B
(7 Gyr). We suggest that this magnetic transition may represent a disruption of
the global dynamo arising from weaker differential rotation, and we outline
plans to probe this phenomenon in additional stars spanning a wide range of
spectral types.

generate superior predictive performance. However, different loss reserving
models specialise in capturing different aspects of loss data. This is
recognised in practice in the sense that results from different models are
often considered, and sometimes combined. For instance, actuaries may take a
weighted average of the prediction outcomes from various loss reserving models,
often based on subjective assessments.
  In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to objectively combine (i.e.
ensemble) multiple _stochastic_ loss reserving models such that the strengths
offered by different models can be utilised effectively. Our framework contains
two main innovations compared to existing literature and practice. Firstly, our
criteria model combination considers the full distributional properties of the
ensemble and not just the central estimate - which is of particular importance
in the reserving context. Secondly, our framework is that it is tailored for
the features inherent to reserving data. These include, for instance, accident,
development, calendar, and claim maturity effects. Crucially, the relative
importance and scarcity of data across accident periods renders the problem
distinct from the traditional ensembling techniques in statistical learning.
  Our framework is illustrated with a complex synthetic dataset. In the
results, the optimised ensemble outperforms both (i) traditional model
selection strategies, and (ii) an equally weighted ensemble. In particular, the
improvement occurs not only with central estimates but also relevant quantiles,
such as the 75th percentile of reserves (typically of interest to both insurers
and regulators).

We model this interaction through the lens of strategic classification (Hardt

measure the individual rarity of each image synthesized by generative models.
We first show empirical observation that common samples are close to each other

feature space. We then use our metric to demonstrate that the extent to which
different generative models produce rare images can be effectively compared. We
also propose a method to compare rarities between datasets that share the same

fake images. SGMs are known to surpass other generative models, e.g.,
generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs).
Being inspired by their big success, in this work, we fully customize them for
generating fake tabular data. In particular, we are interested in oversampling
minor classes since imbalanced classes frequently lead to sub-optimal training
outcomes. To our knowledge, we are the first presenting a score-based tabular
data oversampling method. Firstly, we re-design our own score network since we
have to process tabular data. Secondly, we propose two options for our
generation method: the former is equivalent to a style transfer for tabular
data and the latter uses the standard generative policy of SGMs. Lastly, we
define a fine-tuning method, which further enhances the oversampling quality.
In our experiments with 6 datasets and 10 baselines, our method outperforms
other oversampling methods in all cases.

While an upper confidence bound (UCB)-based algorithm has recently been shown
to achieve nearly-optimal performance guarantees in a setting where all tasks
are solved concurrently, it remains unclear whether Thompson sampling (TS)
algorithms, which have superior empirical performance in general, share similar
theoretical properties. In this work, we present a TS-type algorithm for a more
general online multi-task learning protocol, which extends the concurrent

nearly-optimal using a novel concentration inequality for multi-task data
aggregation at random stopping times. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm on
synthetic data and show that the TS-type algorithm enjoys superior empirical
performance in comparison with the UCB-based algorithm and a baseline algorithm

superior methods have been proposed to handle scalability and oversmoothing
issues on graph structure learning. However, most of those strategies are
designed based on practical experience rather than theoretical analysis. In
this paper, we use a particular dummy node connecting to all existing vertices
without affecting original vertex and edge properties. We further prove that
such the dummy node can help build an efficient monomorphic edge-to-vertex
transform and an epimorphic inverse to recover the original graph back. It also
indicates that adding dummy nodes can preserve local and global structures for
better graph representation learning. We extend graph kernels and graph neural
networks with dummy nodes and conduct experiments on graph classification and
subgraph isomorphism matching tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that taking
graphs with dummy nodes as input significantly boosts graph structure learning,
and using their edge-to-vertex graphs can also achieve similar results. We also
discuss the gain of expressive power from the dummy in neural networks.

require instance-wise data augmentations which are difficult to design for
unstructured tabular data. Existing tabular-SSL methods design such
augmentations in a relatively ad-hoc fashion and can fail to capture the
underlying data manifold. Instead of augmentations based approaches for
tabular-SSL, we propose a new reconstruction based method, called Masked
Encoding for Tabular Data (MET), that does not require augmentations. MET is
based on the popular MAE approach for vision-SSL [He et al., 2021] and uses two
key ideas: (i) since each coordinate in a tabular dataset has a distinct
meaning, we need to use separate representations for all coordinates, and (ii)
using an adversarial reconstruction loss in addition to the standard one.
Empirical results on five diverse tabular datasets show that MET achieves a new
state of the art (SOTA) on all of these datasets and improves up to 9% over
current SOTA methods. We shed more light on the working of MET via experiments
on carefully designed simple datasets.

assume access to a seed set of instances which contain these rare data
instances. However, in the event of more extreme rareness, it is reasonable to
assume that these rare data instances (either classes or slices) may not even
be present in the seed labeled set, and a critical need for the active learning
paradigm is to efficiently discover these rare data instances. In this work, we
provide an active data discovery framework which can mine unknown data slices
and classes efficiently using the submodular conditional gain and submodular
conditional mutual information functions. We provide a general algorithmic
framework which works in a number of scenarios including image classification
and object detection and works with both rare classes and rare slices present
in the unlabeled set. We show significant accuracy and labeling efficiency
gains with our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art active learning
approaches for actively discovering these rare classes and slices.

degenerated feature representations and consequently jeopardizing the model's
generalizability and interpretability. However, shortcut learning in the widely
used Vision Transformer framework is largely unknown. Meanwhile, introducing
domain-specific knowledge is a major approach to rectifying the shortcuts,
which are predominated by background related factors. For example, in the
medical imaging field, eye-gaze data from radiologists is an effective human
visual prior knowledge that has the great potential to guide the deep learning
models to focus on meaningful foreground regions of interest. However,
obtaining eye-gaze data is time-consuming, labor-intensive and sometimes even
not practical. In this work, we propose a novel and effective saliency-guided
vision transformer (SGT) model to rectify shortcut learning in ViT with the
absence of eye-gaze data. Specifically, a computational visual saliency model
is adopted to predict saliency maps for input image samples. Then, the saliency
maps are used to distil the most informative image patches. In the proposed
SGT, the self-attention among image patches focus only on the distilled
informative ones. Considering this distill operation may lead to global
information lost, we further introduce, in the last encoder layer, a residual
connection that captures the self-attention across all the image patches. The
experiment results on four independent public datasets show that our SGT
framework can effectively learn and leverage human prior knowledge without eye
gaze data and achieves much better performance than baselines. Meanwhile, it
successfully rectifies the harmful shortcut learning and significantly improves
the interpretability of the ViT model, demonstrating the promise of
transferring human prior knowledge derived visual saliency in rectifying
shortcut learning

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video Anomaly Detection(VAD) has been traditionally tackled in two main
methodologies: the reconstruction-based approach and the prediction-based one.
As the reconstruction-based methods learn to generalize the input image, the
model merely learns an identity function and strongly causes the problem called
generalizing issue. On the other hand, since the prediction-based ones learn to
predict a future frame given several previous frames, they are less sensitive
to the generalizing issue. However, it is still uncertain if the model can
learn the spatio-temporal context of a video. Our intuition is that the
understanding of the spatio-temporal context of a video plays a vital role in
VAD as it provides precise information on how the appearance of an event in a
video clip changes. Hence, to fully exploit the context information for anomaly
detection in video circumstances, we designed the transformer model with three
different contextual prediction streams: masked, whole and partial. By learning
to predict the missing frames of consecutive normal frames, our model can
effectively learn various normality patterns in the video, which leads to a
high reconstruction error at the abnormal cases that are unsuitable to the
learned context. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we assess our
model on the public benchmark datasets: USCD Pedestrian 2, CUHK Avenue and
ShanghaiTech and evaluate the performance with the anomaly score metric of
reconstruction error. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach
achieves a competitive performance compared to the existing video anomaly
detection methods.

these models is to first pre-train them on a generic dataset using a
self-supervised task (e.g, filling masked words in sentences). Then, these
models are fine-tuned to support specific tasks of interest (e.g, language
translation). A single model can be fine-tuned to support multiple tasks,
possibly exploiting the benefits of transfer learning. This means that
knowledge acquired to solve a specific task (e.g, language translation) can be
useful to boost performance on another task (e.g, sentiment classification).
While the benefits of transfer learning have been widely studied in NLP,
limited empirical evidence is available when it comes to code-related tasks. In
this paper, we assess the performance of the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer

  and Semantic-Region-Aware Inpainting","BMVC 2021 Oral Presentation",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hairstyle transfer is the task of modifying a source hairstyle to a target
one. Although recent hairstyle transfer models can reflect the delicate
features of hairstyles, they still have two major limitations. First, the
existing methods fail to transfer hairstyles when a source and a target image
have different poses (e.g., viewing direction or face size), which is prevalent
in the real world. Also, the previous models generate unrealistic images when
there is a non-trivial amount of regions in the source image occluded by its
original hair. When modifying long hair to short hair, shoulders or backgrounds
occluded by the long hair need to be inpainted. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework for pose-invariant hairstyle transfer, HairFIT. Our
model consists of two stages: 1) flow-based hair alignment and 2) hair
synthesis. In the hair alignment stage, we leverage a keypoint-based optical
flow estimator to align a target hairstyle with a source pose. Then, we
generate a final hairstyle-transferred image in the hair synthesis stage based
on Semantic-region-aware Inpainting Mask (SIM) estimator. Our SIM estimator
divides the occluded regions in the source image into different semantic
regions to reflect their distinct features during the inpainting. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct quantitative and
qualitative evaluations using multi-view datasets, K-hairstyle and VoxCeleb.
The results indicate that HairFIT achieves a state-of-the-art performance by
successfully transferring hairstyles between images of different poses, which
has never been achieved before.

operations in the model parameter space. But what happens if we optimize in the

hierarchical models which include statistical mixtures or stochastic neural
networks, and these models are said to be singular. Singular models reveal
several important and well-studied problems in machine learning like the
decrease in convergence speed of learning trajectories due to attractor
behaviors. In this work, we propose a relative reparameterization technique of
the parameter space, which yields a general method for extracting regular
submodels from singular models. Our method enforces model identifiability
during training and we study the learning dynamics for gradient descent and
expectation maximization for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) under relative

on given data. It has been successfully applied for probabilistic predictions
of structural systems to quantify, for example, the crack growth in mechanical
structures. Typically, predefined mean and covariance functions are employed to
construct the Gaussian process model. Then, the model is updated using current
data during operation while prior information based on previous data is
ignored. However, predefined mean and covariance functions without prior
information reduce the potential of Gaussian processes. This paper proposes a
method to improve the predictive capabilities of Gaussian processes. We
integrate prior knowledge by deriving the mean and covariance functions from
previous data. More specifically, we first approximate previous data by a
weighted sum of basis functions and then derive the mean and covariance
functions directly from the estimated weight coefficients. Basis functions may
be either estimated or derived from problem-specific governing equations to
incorporate physical information. The applicability and effectiveness of this
approach are demonstrated for fatigue crack growth, laser degradation, and
milling machine wear data. We show that well-chosen mean and covariance
functions, like those based on previous data, significantly increase look-ahead
time and accuracy. Using physical basis functions further improves accuracy. In
addition, computation effort for training is significantly reduced.

from EHT about the Sgr A*'s shadow lets us have a novel possibility of
exploration of Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) within the Standard-Model
Extension (SME) framework. Despite the agreement between the shadow image of
Sgr A* and the prediction of the general theory of relativity, there is still a
slight difference which is expected to be fixed by taking some fundamental
corrections into account. We bring up the idea that the recent inferred shadow
image of Sgr A* is explicable by a minimal SME-inspired Schwarzschild metric
containing the Lorentz violating (LV) terms obtained from the post-Newtonian
approximation. The LV terms embedded in Schwarzschild metric are dimensionless
spatial coefficients ${\bar s}^{jk}$ associated with the field responsible for
LSV in the gravitational sector of the minimal SME theory. In this way, one can
control Lorentz invariance violation in the allowed sensitivity level of the
first shadow image of Sgr A*. Actually, using the bounds released within
$1\sigma$ uncertainty for the shadow size of Sgr A* and whose fractional
deviation from standard Schwarzschild, we set upper limits for the two
different combinations of spatial diagonal coefficients and the time-time
coefficient of the SME, as well. The best upper bound is at the $10^{-2}$
level, which should be interpreted differently from those constraints
previously extracted from well-known frameworks since unlike standard SME
studies it is not obtained from a Sun-centered celestial frame but comes from
probing the black hole horizon scale.

interaction feedback, click models have been much studied during recent years.
Most click models focus on user behaviors towards a single list. However, with
the development of user interface (UI) design, the layout of displayed items on
a result page tends to be multi-block (i.e., multi-list) style instead of a
single list, which requires different assumptions to model user behaviors more
accurately. There exist click models for multi-block pages in desktop contexts,
but they cannot be directly applied to mobile scenarios due to different
interaction manners, result types and especially multi-block presentation
styles. In particular, multi-block mobile pages can normally be decomposed into
interleavings of basic vertical blocks and horizontal blocks, thus resulting in
typically F-shape forms. To mitigate gaps between desktop and mobile contexts
for multi-block pages, we conduct a user eye-tracking study, and identify
users' sequential browsing, block skip and comparison patterns on F-shape
pages. These findings lead to the design of a novel F-shape Click Model (FSCM),
which serves as a general solution to multi-block mobile pages. Firstly, we
construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for each page, where each item is
regarded as a vertex and each edge indicates the user's possible examination
flow. Secondly, we propose DAG-structured GRUs and a comparison module to model
users' sequential (sequential browsing, block skip) and non-sequential
(comparison) behaviors respectively. Finally, we combine GRU states and
comparison patterns to perform user click predictions. Experiments on a
large-scale real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of FSCM on user

operator that recovers at the discrete level the algebraic property related to
the divergence of the curl of a vector field, which is typically referred to as
div-curl problem. A staggered Cartesian grid is adopted in 3D, where the vector
field is naturally defined at the corners of the control volume, while its curl
is evaluated as a cell-centered quantity. Firstly, the curl operator is
rewritten as the divergence of a tensor, hence allowing compatible finite
difference schemes to be devised and to be proven to mimic the algebraic
div-curl property. Successively, a high order DG divergence operator is built
upon integration by parts, so that the structure-preserving finite difference
div-curl operator is exactly retrieved for first order discretizations. We
further demonstrate that the novel SPDG schemes are capable of obtaining a zero
div-curl identity with machine precision from second up to sixth order
accuracy. In a second part, we show the applicability of these SPDG methods by
solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations written in vortex-stream
formulation. This hyperbolic system deals with divergence-free involutions
related to the velocity and vorticity field as well as to the stream function,
thus it provides an ideal setting for the validation of the novel schemes. A
compatible discretization of the numerical viscosity is also proposed in order
to maintain the structure-preserving property of the div-curl DG operators even
in the presence of artificial or physical dissipative terms. Finally, to
overcome the time step restriction dictated by the viscous sub-system,
Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta time stepping techniques are tailored to
handle the SPDG framework.

exploiting the knowledge relationships between entities in the utterances, and

accretion flows (NDAFs) with outflows, on top of the conventional core-collapse

with outflows, the total metal mass (i.e., the summation of the conventional
CCSN and NDAFs with outflows) per CCSN depends weakly upon the mass of the
progenitor star if the mass is in the range of $\sim 25-55~M_{\odot}$. We model
the chemical evolution by adopting a improved open-box model with three typical
initial mass functions (IMFs). We find that, with the additional chemical
contribution from NDAFs with outflows, the quasar metallicity can be enriched
more rapidly in the very early Universe ($z \sim 10$) and reaches higher
saturation than the no-NDAF case at $z \sim 8$, after which they evolve slowly

RPCD consists of 74K images and 220K comments and is collected from a Reddit

regions offers a natural metric to characterize the expressiveness of CPWL
mappings. Although the precise determination of this quantity is often out of
reach, bounds have been proposed for specific architectures, including the
well-known ReLU and Maxout networks. In this work, we propose a more general
perspective and provide precise bounds on the maximal number of linear regions
of CPWL networks based on three sources of expressiveness: depth, width, and
activation complexity. Our estimates rely on the combinatorial structure of
convex partitions and highlight the distinctive role of depth which, on its
own, is able to exponentially increase the number of regions. We then introduce
a complementary stochastic framework to estimate the average number of linear
regions produced by a CPWL network architecture. Under reasonable assumptions,
the expected density of linear regions along any 1D path is bounded by the
product of depth, width, and a measure of activation complexity (up to a
scaling factor). This yields an identical role to the three sources of
expressiveness: no exponential growth with depth is observed anymore.

proposed as a likelihood-based approach with ODE fidelity and sparsity-inducing
regularization, along with efficient computation based on parameter cascading.
Second, two versions of the two-step collocation methods are extended to the
non-Gaussian set-up by incorporating the iteratively reweighted least squares
technique. Simulations show that the profiling procedure has excellent
performance in latent process and derivative fitting and ODE parameter
estimation, while the two-step collocation approach excels in identifying the
sparse structure of the ODE system. The usefulness of the proposed methods is
also demonstrated by analyzing three real datasets from Google trends, stock
market sectors, and yeast cell cycle studies.

building on results of Deligne and Andr\'e regarding the Kuga-Satake

improve the prediction accuracy of user behaviors by enhancing the expressive

the attractiveness estimator and examination predictor to output the
attractiveness scores and examination probabilities, where graph neural
networks and neighbor interaction techniques are applied to extract the

Finally, we apply combination functions to integrate examination probabilities

conducted on three real-world session datasets show that GraphCM not only
outperforms the state-of-art models, but also achieves superior performance in
addressing the data sparsity and cold-start problems.

The energy dependent dips at $\phi \sim 0.16$ and $0.5$ arise due to complex

absorber could potentially be contributed from accretion curtain/ accretion
stream and absorbing material produced by stream-disc/stream-magnetosphere

circuit Hamiltonian of the qubit, readout resonator and resistor by describing
the latter as an infinite collection of bosonic modes through the
Caldeira-Leggett model. Starting from this Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with
inductive coupling to the remote bath comprised of the resistor, we
consistently obtain the Lindblad master equation for the qubit and resonator in
the dispersive regime. We exploit the underlying symmetries of the master
equation to transform the Liouvillian superoperator into a block diagonal
matrix. The block diagonalization method reveals that the rate of exponential
decoherence of the qubit is well-captured by the slowest decaying eigenmode of
a single block of the Liouvillian superoperator, which can be easily computed.
The model captures the often used dispersive strong limit approximation of the
qubit decoherence rate being linearly proportional to the number of thermal
photons in the readout resonator but predicts remarkably better decoherence
rates when the dissipation rate of the resonator is increased beyond the
dispersive strong regime. Our work provides a full quantitative description of
the contribution to the qubit decoherence rate coming from the control line in
chips that are currently employed in circuit QED laboratories, and suggests
different possible ways to reduce this source of noise.

that can be generated is virtually infinite; no realistic computational effort
can discover the complete technology and spatial diversity. Here, based on our
own SPORES method, a highly customisable and spatially-explicit advancement of
MGA, we empirically test different search strategies - including some adapted
from other MGA approaches - with the aim of identifying how to minimise
redundant computation. With application to a model of the European power
system, we show that, for a fixed number of generated alternatives, there is a
clear trade-off in making use of the available computational power to unveil
technology versus spatial diversity of system configurations. Moreover, we show
that focussing on technology diversity may fail to identify system
configurations that appeal to real-world stakeholders, such as those in which
capacity is more spread out at the local scale. Based on this evidence that no
feasible alternative can be deemed redundant a priori, we propose to initially
search for options in a way that balances spatial and technology diversity;
this can be achieved by combining the strengths of two different strategies.
The resulting solution space can then be refined based on the feedback of
stakeholders. More generally, we propose the adoption of ad-hoc MGA sensitivity
analyses, targeted at testing a study's central claims, as a computationally
inexpensive standard to improve the quality of energy modelling analyses.

  Generation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning models are found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, as
wrong predictions can be caused by small perturbation in input for deep
learning models. Most of the existing works of adversarial image generation try
to achieve attacks for most models, while few of them make efforts on
guaranteeing the perceptual quality of the adversarial examples. High quality
adversarial examples matter for many applications, especially for the privacy
preserving. In this work, we develop a framework based on the Minimum
Noticeable Difference (MND) concept to generate adversarial privacy preserving
images that have minimum perceptual difference from the clean ones but are able
to attack deep learning models. To achieve this, an adversarial loss is firstly
proposed to make the deep learning models attacked by the adversarial images
successfully. Then, a perceptual quality-preserving loss is developed by taking
the magnitude of perturbation and perturbation-caused structural and gradient
changes into account, which aims to preserve high perceptual quality for
adversarial image generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work on exploring quality-preserving adversarial image generation based on the
MND concept for privacy preserving. To evaluate its performance in terms of
perceptual quality, the deep models on image classification and face
recognition are tested with the proposed method and several anchor methods in
this work. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MND
framework is capable of generating adversarial images with remarkably improved
performance metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, and MOS) than that generated with the
anchor methods.

their more reliable neighboring measurements to reduce the measurement

navigate to a goal location following natural language instructions in
unfamiliar environments.
  Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant improvements on
the VLN task. Since the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture can
better integrate inter- and intra-modal information of vision and language.
  However, there exist two problems in current transformer-based models.
  1) The models process each view independently without taking the integrity of
the objects into account.
  2) During the self-attention operation in the visual modality, the views that
are spatially distant can be inter-weaved with each other without explicit
restriction. This kind of mixing may introduce extra noise instead of useful
information.
  To address these issues, we propose 1) A slot-attention based module to
incorporate information from segmentation of the same object. 2) A local
attention mask mechanism to limit the visual attention span. The proposed
modules can be easily plugged into any VLN architecture and we use the
Recurrent VLN-Bert as our base model. Experiments on the R2R dataset show that

randomized experiments due to the trade-off between internal validity and
external validity. To quantify the robustness of external validity, one must
first conceptualize the gap between a sample that is fully representative of
the target population (i.e., the ideal sample) and the observed sample. Drawing
on Frank & Min (2007) and Frank et al. (2013), I define such gap as the
unobserved sample and intend to quantify its relationship with the null
hypothesis statistical testing (NHST) in this study. The probability of
invalidating a causal inference due to limited external validity, i.e., the
PEV, is the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis based on the
ideal sample provided the null hypothesis has been rejected based on the
observed sample. This study illustrates the guideline and the procedure of
evaluating external validity with the PEV through an empirical example (i.e.,
Borman et al. (2008)). Specifically, one would be able to locate the threshold
of the unobserved sample statistic that would make the PEV higher than a
desired value and use this information to characterize the unobserved sample
that would render external validity of the research in question less robust.
The PEV is shown to be linked to statistical power when the NHST is thought to
be based on the ideal sample.

Aware Multi-label Predictions (CHAMP), a framework that penalizes a
misprediction depending on its severity as per the hierarchy tree. While there
have been works that apply such an idea to single-label classification, to the

there is no clear way of quantifying the severity of a misprediction a priori

segmentation models apply bilinear up-sampling and convolutions to feature maps

bilinear up-sampling blurs the precise information learned in these feature
maps and convolutions incur extra computation costs. To address these issues,
we propose the Implicit Feature Alignment function (IFA). Our method is
inspired by the rapidly expanding topic of implicit neural representations,
where coordinate-based neural networks are used to designate fields of signals.
In IFA, feature vectors are viewed as representing a 2D field of information.
Given a query coordinate, nearby feature vectors with their relative
coordinates are taken from the multi-level feature maps and then fed into an
MLP to generate the corresponding output. As such, IFA implicitly aligns the
feature maps at different levels and is capable of producing segmentation maps
in arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate the efficacy of IFA on multiple
datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and ADE20K. Our method can be
combined with improvement on various architectures, and it achieves

can offer higher accuracy. However, employing such models on the resource- and
energy-constrained embedded platforms is inefficient. Towards this, we present
a tinySNN framework that optimizes the memory and energy requirements of SNN
processing in both the training and inference phases, while keeping the
accuracy high. It is achieved by reducing the SNN operations, improving the
learning quality, quantizing the SNN parameters, and selecting the appropriate
SNN model. Furthermore, our tinySNN quantizes different SNN parameters (i.e.,
weights and neuron parameters) to maximize the compression while exploring
different combinations of quantization schemes, precision levels, and rounding
schemes to find the model that provides acceptable accuracy. The experimental
results demonstrate that our tinySNN significantly reduces the memory footprint
and the energy consumption of SNNs without accuracy loss as compared to the
baseline network. Therefore, our tinySNN effectively compresses the given SNN
model to achieve high accuracy in a memory- and energy-efficient manner, hence
enabling the employment of SNNs for the resource- and energy-constrained

visual-language representation learning in recent years. Current VL models
either use lightweight uni-modal encoders and learn to extract, align and fuse
both modalities simultaneously in a deep cross-modal encoder, or feed the
last-layer uni-modal representations from the deep pre-trained uni-modal
encoders into the top cross-modal encoder. Both approaches potentially restrict
vision-language representation learning and limit model performance. In this
paper, we propose BridgeTower, which introduces multiple bridge layers that
build a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer
of the cross-modal encoder. This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal
alignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different
semantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal encoders in the cross-modal encoder.
Pre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower achieves state-of-the-art
performance on various downstream vision-language tasks. In particular, on the
VQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming
the previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training
data and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs.
Notably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of
81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger

their adaptability and ability to learn from sparse data. However, for the
ubiquitous non-interactive features in sparse data, existing FMs can only
estimate the parameters corresponding to these features via the inner product
of their embeddings. Undeniably, they cannot learn the direct interactions of
these features, which limits the model's expressive power. To this end, we
first present MixFM, inspired by Mixup, to generate auxiliary training data to
boost FMs. Unlike existing augmentation strategies that require labor costs and
expertise to collect additional information such as position and fields, these
extra data generated by MixFM only by the convex combination of the raw ones
without any professional knowledge support. More importantly, if the parent
samples to be mixed have non-interactive features, MixFM will establish their
direct interactions. Second, considering that MixFM may generate redundant or
even detrimental instances, we further put forward a novel Factorization
Machine powered by Saliency-guided Mixup (denoted as SMFM). Guided by the
customized saliency, SMFM can generate more informative neighbor data. Through
theoretical analysis, we prove that the proposed methods minimize the upper
bound of the generalization error, which hold a beneficial effect on enhancing
FMs. Significantly, we give the first generalization bound of FM, implying the
generalization requires more data and a smaller embedding size under the
sufficient representation capability. Finally, extensive experiments on five

results show that ""poisoning"" mixed data is likewise beneficial to the FM

We collected a large-scale dataset from mouse primary visual cortex containing
the responses of more than 28,000 neurons across seven mice stimulated with
thousands of natural images, together with simultaneous behavioral measurements

The exact underlying reasons for this are still not completely understood.
Here, we explore the causes of robust overfitting by comparing the data
distribution of \emph{non-overfit} (weak adversary) and \emph{overfitted}
(strong adversary) adversarial training, and observe that the distribution of
the adversarial data generated by weak adversary mainly contain small-loss
data. However, the adversarial data generated by strong adversary is more
diversely distributed on the large-loss data and the small-loss data. Given
these observations, we further designed data ablation adversarial training and
identify that some small-loss data which are not worthy of the adversary
strength cause robust overfitting in the strong adversary mode. To relieve this
issue, we propose \emph{minimum loss constrained adversarial training} (MLCAT):
in a minibatch, we learn large-loss data as usual, and adopt additional
measures to increase the loss of the small-loss data. Technically, MLCAT
hinders data fitting when they become easy to learn to prevent robust
overfitting; philosophically, MLCAT reflects the spirit of turning waste into
treasure and making the best use of each adversarial data; algorithmically, we
designed two realizations of MLCAT, and extensive experiments demonstrate that
MLCAT can eliminate robust overfitting and further boost adversarial
robustness.

trace the three-dimensional matter distributions with wider area coverage in

towards more massive halos along filamentary structures, contrary to a widely
employed luminous red galaxy sample, the dynamics specific to ELGs should be
taken into account to refine the theoretical modelling at non-linear scales. In
this paper, we scrutinise the halo occupation distribution (HOD) and clustering
properties of ELGs by utilising IllustrisTNG galaxy formation hydrodynamical
simulations. Leveraging stellar population synthesis technique coupled with the
photo-ionization model, we compute line intensities of simulated galaxies and
construct mock H$\alpha$ and [OII] ELG catalogues. The line luminosity
functions and the relation between the star formation rate and line intensity
are well consistent with observational estimates. Next, we measure the HOD and
demonstrate that there is a distinct population for the central HOD, which
corresponds to low-mass infalling halos. We then perform the statistical
inference of HOD parameters from the projected correlation function. Our
analysis indicates that the inferred HODs significantly deviate from the HOD
measured directly from simulations although the best-fit model yields a good
fit to the projected correlation function. It implies that the information
content of the projected correlation function is not adequate to constrain HOD
models correctly and thus, it is important to employ mock ELG catalogues to
calibrate the functional form of HOD models and add prior information on HOD
parameters to robustly determine the HOD.

of non-centrosymmetric time-reversal invariant Weyl semimetals. To do so, we
perform a tomography of the Berry curvature dipole in a slab system using a
minimal two-band model. We find that in the type-I phase, the nonlinear Hall
response is not particularly sensitive to the presence of Fermi arcs or other
trivial surface states. However, in the type-II phase, we find that these
surface states contribute substantially to the Berry curvature dipole, leading
to a strong thickness dependence of the nonlinear Hall response. This feature
depends on the nature of the surface states and, henceforth, on the slab
geometry adopted. In order to assess the validity of this scenario for
realistic systems, we performed Berry curvature dipole calculations by first
principles on the WTe$_2$, confirming the dramatic impact of surface states for
selected slab geometries. Our results suggest that surface states, being
topological or not, can contribute much more efficiently to the nonlinear Hall
response than bulk states. This prediction is not limited to topological
semimetals and should apply to topologically trivial non-centrosymmetric
materials and heterostructures, paving the way to interfacial engineering of
the nonlinear Hall effect.

computational cost of deep networks, but also prevents overfitting by
decreasing model capacity. However, our work surprisingly discovers that
network pruning sometimes even aggravates overfitting. We report an unexpected
sparse double descent phenomenon that, as we increase model sparsity via
network pruning, test performance first gets worse (due to overfitting), then
gets better (due to relieved overfitting), and gets worse at last (due to
forgetting useful information). While recent studies focused on the deep double
descent with respect to model overparameterization, they failed to recognize
that sparsity may also cause double descent. In this paper, we have three main
contributions. First, we report the novel sparse double descent phenomenon
through extensive experiments. Second, for this phenomenon, we propose a novel
learning distance interpretation that the curve of $\ell_{2}$ learning distance
of sparse models (from initialized parameters to final parameters) may
correlate with the sparse double descent curve well and reflect generalization
better than minima flatness. Third, in the context of sparse double descent, a

However, tasks of dexterous hand manipulation, even at the baby level, are
challenging to solve through reinforcement learning (RL). The difficulty lies
in the high degrees of freedom and the required cooperation among heterogeneous
agents (e.g., joints of fingers). In this study, we propose the Bimanual
Dexterous Hands Benchmark (Bi-DexHands), a simulator that involves two
dexterous hands with tens of bimanual manipulation tasks and thousands of
target objects. Specifically, tasks in Bi-DexHands are designed to match
different levels of human motor skills according to cognitive science
literature. We built Bi-DexHands in the Issac Gym; this enables highly
efficient RL training, reaching 30,000+ FPS by only one single NVIDIA RTX 3090.
We provide a comprehensive benchmark for popular RL algorithms under different
settings; this includes Single-agent/Multi-agent RL, Offline RL, Multi-task RL,
and Meta RL. Our results show that the PPO type of on-policy algorithms can
master simple manipulation tasks that are equivalent up to 48-month human
babies (e.g., catching a flying object, opening a bottle), while multi-agent RL
can further help to master manipulations that require skilled bimanual
cooperation (e.g., lifting a pot, stacking blocks). Despite the success on each
single task, when it comes to acquiring multiple manipulation skills, existing
RL algorithms fail to work in most of the multi-task and the few-shot learning
settings, which calls for more substantial development from the RL community.

granular systems, much less is known about active jamming (or unjamming), which
commonly takes place in living materials. In this paper, we explore, by
molecular dynamic simulations, the jamming-unjamming transition in a dense
system of active semi-flexible filaments. In particular we characterise the
distinct impact of polar versus nematic driving for different filament rigidity
and at varying density. Our results show that high densities of dynamic active
filaments can be achieved by only changing the nature of the active force,
nematic or polar. Interestingly, while polar driving is more effective at
unjamming the system at high densities below confluency, we find that at even
higher densities nematic driving enhances unjamming compared to its polar
counterpart. The effect of varying the rigidity of filaments is also
significantly different in the two cases: while for nematic driving lowering
bending rigidity unjams the system, we find an intriguing re-entrant
jamming-unjamming-jamming transition for polar driving as the filament rigidity
is lowered. While the first transition (unjamming) is driven by softening due
to reduced rigidity, the second transition (jamming) is a cooperative effect of
ordering and coincides with the emergence of nematic order in the system.
Together, through a generic model of self-propelled flexible filaments, our
results demonstrate how tuning the nature of self-propulsion and flexibility
can be employed by active materials to achieve high densities without getting
jammed.

holes, we propose a method to remedy those models that break the dominant
energy condition, e.g., the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We modify the
metrics but ensure their regularity at the same time, so that the weak, null,
and dominant energy conditions are satisfied, with the exception of the strong
energy condition. Likewise, we prove a no-go theorem for conformally related
regular black holes, which states that the four energy conditions can never be
met in this class of black holes. In order to seek evidences for distinguishing
regular black holes from singular black holes, we resort to analogue gravity
and regard it as a tool to mimic realistic regular black holes in a fluid. The
equations of state for the fluid are solved via an asymptotic analysis
associated with a numerical method, which provides a modus operandi for
experimental observations, in particular, the conditions under which one can
simulate realistic regular black holes in the fluid.

geometric analysis. While it does not meet the needs of industrial mass
production, because of its time-consuming imaging procedure. This article
proposes a novel stationary real-time CT system with multiple X-ray sources and
detectors, which is able to refresh the CT reconstructed slices to the detector
frame frequency. This kind of structure avoids the movement of the X-ray
sources and detectors. Projections from different angles can be acquired with
the objects' translation, which makes it easier to be integrated into pipeline.
All the detectors are arranged along the conveyor, and observe the objects in
different angle of view. With the translation of objects, their X-ray
projections are obtained for CT reconstruction. To decrease the mechanical size
and reduce the number of X-ray sources and detectors, the FBP reconstruction
algorithm was combined with deep-learning image enhancement. Medical CT images
were applied to train the deep-learning network for its quantity advantage in
comparison with industrial ones. It is the first time to adopt this
source-detector layout strategy. Data augmentation and regularization were used
to elevate the generalization of the network. Time consumption of the CT
imaging process was also calculated to prove its high efficiency. It is an
innovative design for the 4th industrial revolution, providing an intelligent
quality inspection solution for digital production.

parameters in the parametric model, which is commonly done sequentially on
multiple parameters. Without guidance on allowable parameter ranges that can
guarantee the solvability of the geometric constraint system, the user could
assign improper parameter values to the model's parameters, which would further
lead to a failure in model updating. However, current commercial CAD systems
provide little support for the proper parameter assignments. Although the
existing methods can compute allowable ranges for individual parameters, they
face difficulties in handling multi-parameter situations. In particular, these
methods could miss some feasible parameter values and provide incomplete
allowable parameter ranges. To solve this problem, an automatic approach is
proposed in this paper to compute complete parameter ranges in multi-parameter
editing. In the approach, a set of variable parameters are first selected to be
sequentially edited by the user; before each editing operation, the
one-dimensional ranges of the variable parameters are presented as guidance. To
compute the one-dimensional ranges, each variable parameter is expressed as an
equality-constrained function, and its one-dimensional allowable range is
obtained by calculating the function range. To effectively obtain the function
range which can hardly be calculated in a normal way, the function range
problem is converted into a constrained optimization problem, and is then
solved by Lagrange multiplier method and the Niching particle swarm
optimization algorithm (the NichePSO). The effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed approach is verified by several experimental results.

bias in machine learning and a pillar of many traditional algorithms. By
default, deep networks are not equipped with this inductive bias and therefore
many alternative solutions have been proposed through differential
optimization. Current approaches tend to optimize classification and separation
jointly: aligning inputs with class vectors and separating class vectors
angularly. This paper proposes a simple alternative: encoding maximum
separation as an inductive bias in the network by adding one fixed matrix
multiplication before computing the softmax activations. The main observation
behind our approach is that separation does not require optimization but can be
solved in closed-form prior to training and plugged into a network. We outline
a recursive approach to obtain the matrix consisting of maximally separable
vectors for any number of classes, which can be added with negligible
engineering effort and computational overhead. Despite its simple nature, this
one matrix multiplication provides real impact. We show that our proposal
directly boosts classification, long-tailed recognition, out-of-distribution
detection, and open-set recognition, from CIFAR to ImageNet. We find
empirically that maximum separation works best as a fixed bias; making the
matrix learnable adds nothing to the performance. The closed-form
implementation and code to reproduce the experiments are available on github.

after changes to it. The simplest approach for regression testing consists of
re-running the entire test suite against the changed version of the SUT.
However, this might result in a time- and resource-consuming process; \eg when
dealing with large and/or complex SUTs and test suits. To work around this
problem, test Case Selection (TCS) strategies can be used. Such strategies seek
to build a temporary test suite comprising only those test cases that are
relevant to the changes made to the SUT, so avoiding executing those test cases
that do not exercise the changed parts. In this paper, we introduce CATTO

The former is a tool implementing a TCS strategy for SUTs written in Java,
while the latter is a wrapper to allow developers to use \toolName directly in
IntelliJ. We also conducted a preliminary evaluation of CATTO on seven
open-source Java SUTs in terms of reductions in test-suite size, fault-reveling
test cases, and fault-detection capability. The results are promising and

Clone detection is a fundamental branch of automatic source code comprehension,
having many applications in refactoring recommendation, plagiarism detection,

the detection of semantic clones, i.e., code snippets that have the same
functionality but significantly differ in implementation. A promising approach
to detecting semantic clones is contrastive learning (CL), a machine learning
paradigm popular in computer vision but not yet commonly adopted for code
processing.
  Our work aims to evaluate the most popular CL algorithms combined with three
source code representations on two tasks. The first task is code clone
detection, which we evaluate on the POJ-104 dataset containing implementations
of 104 algorithms. The second task is plagiarism detection. To evaluate the
models on this task, we introduce CodeTransformator, a tool for transforming
source code. We use it to create a dataset that mimics plagiarised code based
on competitive programming solutions. We trained nine models for both tasks and
compared them with six existing approaches, including traditional tools and
modern pre-trained neural models. The results of our evaluation show that
proposed models perform diversely in each task, however the performance of the
graph-based models is generally above the others. Among CL algorithms, SimCLR
and SwAV lead to better results, while Moco is the most robust approach. Our

accretion by a compact companion, wind interaction with a hot sub-dwarf

These scenarios should lead to diverse dependences of the hard X-ray emission
on disc density. We collected X-ray observations of gamma Cas during an episode
of enhanced disc activity around January 2021. We investigate the variations in
the disc properties using time series of dedicated optical spectroscopy and
existing broadband photometry. Epoch-dependent Doppler maps of the H-alpha,
H-beta, and He I 5876 emission lines are built to characterise the emission
regions in velocity space. We analyse 4 XMM-Newton observations taken at key
phases of the enhanced disc activity episode. Archival data are used to study
the long-term correlation between optical and X-ray emission. Optical
spectroscopy unveils an increase in the radial extent of the emission regions
during the episode of enhanced disc activity, whilst no increase in the V-band
flux is recorded. Doppler maps do not reveal any stable feature in the disc
resulting from the putative action of the companion on the outer parts of the
Be disc. No increase in the hard emission is observed in relation to the
enhanced disc activity. However, at two occasions, the soft X-ray emission of
gamma Cas is strongly attenuated, suggesting more efficient obscuration by a
large flaring Be disc. There is a strong correlation between the long-term
variations in the X-ray flux and in the V-band photometry. The observed
behaviour of gamma Cas suggests no direct link between the properties of the
outer regions of the Be disc and the hard X-ray emission, but favours a link
between the level of X-ray emission and the properties of the inner part of the
Be disc. These results thus disfavour an accretion or colliding wind scenario.

with high-dimensional data where the number of available measurements (sample
size) is much smaller than the dimension of the parameter space. Traditional
methods for model selection such as Akaike information criterion, Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) and minimum description length are heavily prone to
overfitting in the high-dimensional setting. In this regard, extended BIC
(EBIC), which is an extended version of the original BIC and extended Fisher
information criterion (EFIC), which is a combination of EBIC and Fisher
information criterion, are consistent estimators of the true model as the
number of measurements grows very large. However, EBIC is not consistent in
high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) scenarios where the sample size is fixed and
EFIC is not invariant to data scaling resulting in unstable behaviour. In this
paper, we propose a new form of the EBIC criterion called EBIC-Robust, which is
invariant to data scaling and consistent in both large sample size and high-SNR
scenarios. Analytical proofs are presented to guarantee its consistency.
Simulation results indicate that the performance of EBIC-Robust is quite
superior to that of both EBIC and EFIC.

detection and computational load to perform scan matching. Existing WiFi
infrastructure can be exploited for localization and mapping with low hardware

as different signal values can be measured at the same location due to the
unpredictability of signal propagation. Therefore, we introduce the use of WiFi
fingerprint sequence for pose estimation (i.e. loop closure) in SLAM. This
approach exploits the spatial coherence of location fingerprints obtained while
a mobile robot is moving. This has better capability of correcting odometry
drift. The method also incorporates LiDAR scans and thus, improving
computational efficiency for large and geometrically-degraded environments

that we can evaluate any non-Markov policy that switches between a set of base
Markov policies with fixed probability by a careful composition of the base
policy GHMs, without any additional learning. We can then apply generalised
policy improvement (GPI) to collections of such non-Markov policies to obtain a
new Markov policy that will in general outperform its precursors. We provide a
thorough theoretical analysis of this approach, develop applications to
transfer and standard RL, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness over
standard GPI on a challenging deep RL continuous control task. We also provide
an analysis of GHM training methods, proving a novel convergence result
regarding previously proposed methods and showing how to train these models
stably in deep RL settings.

manipulation remains a significant challenge as it requires a seamless
integration of end-effector trajectory generation with navigation skills as

large configuration space, and to navigate dynamic and unknown environments. In
previous work, we proposed to decompose mobile manipulation tasks into a
simplified motion generator for the end-effector in task space and a trained
reinforcement learning agent for the mobile base to account for kinematic
feasibility of the motion. In this work, we introduce Neural Navigation for
Mobile Manipulation (N$^2$M$^2$) which extends this decomposition to complex
obstacle environments and enables it to tackle a broad range of tasks in real
world settings. The resulting approach can perform unseen, long-horizon tasks
in unexplored environments while instantly reacting to dynamic obstacles and
environmental changes. At the same time, it provides a simple way to define new
mobile manipulation tasks. We demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed

when employed by all players in a game, each player's \emph{regret} after $T$
repetitions grows polylogarithmically in $T$, an exponential improvement over
the traditional guarantees within the no-regret framework. However, so far
these results have only been limited to certain classes of games with
structured strategy spaces -- such as normal-form and extensive-form games. The
question as to whether $O(\text{polylog} T)$ regret bounds can be obtained for
general convex and compact strategy sets -- which occur in many fundamental
models in economics and multiagent systems -- while retaining efficient
strategy updates is an important question. In this paper, we answer this in the
positive by establishing the first uncoupled learning algorithm with $O(\log
T)$ per-player regret in general \emph{convex games}, that is, games with
concave utility functions supported on arbitrary convex and compact strategy
sets. Our learning dynamics are based on an instantiation of optimistic
follow-the-regularized-leader over an appropriately \emph{lifted} space using a
\emph{self-concordant regularizer} that is, peculiarly, not a barrier for the
feasible region. Further, our learning dynamics are efficiently implementable
given access to a proximal oracle for the convex strategy set, leading to
$O(\log\log T)$ per-iteration complexity; we also give extensions when access
to only a \emph{linear} optimization oracle is assumed. Finally, we adapt our
dynamics to guarantee $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial regime. Even in
those special cases where prior results apply, our algorithm improves over the
state-of-the-art regret bounds either in terms of the dependence on the number
of iterations or on the dimension of the strategy sets.

distributional CONtrastive Variational AutoEncoder (FarconVAE), which induces
the latent space to be disentangled into sensitive and nonsensitive parts. We
first construct the pair of observations with different sensitive attributes

be closer, while sensitive latents to be far from each other and also far from
the non-sensitive latent by contrasting their distributions. We provide a new
type of contrastive loss motivated by Gaussian and Student-t kernels for
distributional contrastive learning with theoretical analysis. Besides, we
adopt a new swap-reconstruction loss to boost the disentanglement further.
FarconVAE shows superior performance on fairness, pretrained model debiasing,

heterogeneous data. To cope with this problem, we assume that despite data
heterogeneity, there are groups of clients who have similar data distributions
that can be clustered. In previous approaches, in order to cluster clients the
server requires clients to send their parameters simultaneously. However, this
can be problematic in a context where there is a significant number of
participants that may have limited availability. To prevent such a bottleneck,
we propose FLIC (Federated Learning with Incremental Clustering), in which the
server exploits the updates sent by clients during federated training instead
of asking them to send their parameters simultaneously. Hence no additional
communications between the server and the clients are necessary other than what
classical federated learning requires. We empirically demonstrate for various
non-IID cases that our approach successfully splits clients into groups
following the same data distributions. We also identify the limitations of FLIC
by studying its capability to partition clients at the early stages of the
federated learning process efficiently. We further address attacks on models as
a form of data heterogeneity and empirically show that FLIC is a robust defense
against poisoning attacks even when the proportion of malicious clients is
higher than 50\%.

(pNML) has been proposed as the min-max regret solution for the
distribution-free setting, where no distributional assumptions are made on the

over-parameterized linear regression. For a large class, a common approach is
to use regularization or a model prior. In the context of online prediction
where the min-max solution is the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML), it has
been suggested to use NML with ``luckiness'': A prior-like function is applied
to the hypothesis class, which reduces its effective size. Motivated by the
luckiness concept, for linear regression we incorporate a luckiness function
that penalizes the hypothesis proportionally to its l2 norm. This leads to the
ridge regression solution. The associated pNML with luckiness (LpNML)
prediction deviates from the ridge regression empirical risk minimizer (Ridge
ERM): When the test data reside in the subspace corresponding to the small
eigenvalues of the empirical correlation matrix of the training data, the
prediction is shifted toward 0. Our LpNML reduces the Ridge ERM error by up to

galaxies in approximate lightcones built from the Millennium-XXL simulation,
which are constructed using different numbers of snapshots. The monopole and
quadrupole of the real-space correlation function is strongly boosted on small
scales below 1 Mpc/h, due to some galaxies being duplicated at the boundaries
between snapshots in the lightcone. When more snapshots are used, the total
number of duplicated galaxies is approximately constant, but they are pushed to
smaller separations. The effect of this in redshift space is small, as long as
the snapshots are cut into shells in real space. Randomly removing duplicated
galaxies is able to reduce the excess clustering signal. Including satellite
galaxies will reduce the impact of the duplicates, since many small-scale pairs
come from satellites in the same halo. Galaxies that are missing from the
lightcone at the boundaries can be added to the lightcone by having a small
overlap between each shell. This effect will impact analyses that use very
small-scale clustering measurements, and when using mocks to test the impact of
fibre collisions.

and research. The key to ranking a node's spreading ability is to evaluate the
fraction of susceptible nodes been infected by the target node during the
outbreak, i.e., the outbreak size. In this paper, we present a dynamic Markov
process (DMP) method by integrating the Markov chain and the spreading process
to evaluate the outbreak size of the initial spreader. Following the idea of
the Markov process, this method solves the problem of nonlinear coupling by
adjusting the state transition matrix and evaluating the probability of the
susceptible node being infected by its infected neighbours. We have employed
the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-infected-susceptible
(SIS) models to test this method on real-world static and temporal networks.
Our results indicate that the DMP method could evaluate the nodes' outbreak
sizes more accurately than previous methods for both single and
multi-spreaders. Besides, it can also be employed to rank the influence of
nodes accurately during the spreading process.

MDD-CF, we firstly study the spectral-efficiency (SE) performance in terms of
one coherence interval (CT) associated with access point (AP)-selection, power-
and subcarrier-allocation. Since the formulated SE optimization is a
mixed-integer non-convex problem that is NP-hard to solve, we leverage the
inherent association between involved variables to transform it into a
continuous-integer convex-concave problem. Then, a quadratic transform
(QT)-assisted iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve SE maximization. Next,
we extend our study to the case of one radio frame consisting of several CT
intervals. In this regard, a novel two-phase CT interval (TPCT) scheme is
designed to not only improve the SE in radio frame but also provide consistent
data transmissions over fast time-varying channels. Correspondingly, to
facilitate the optimization, we propose a two-step iterative algorithm by
building the connections between two phases in TPCT through an iteration
factor. Simulation results show that, MDD-CF can significantly outperform
in-band full duplex (IBFD)-CF due to the efficient interference management.
Furthermore, compared with time-division duplex (TDD)-CF, MDD-CF is more robust
to high-mobility scenarios and achieves better SE performance.

either the number of plays pulling the arm, or its reward capacity when the

likely to pursue the detection accuracy but ignore the robustness of the
detector. To address this problem, we propose a comprehensive robustness

attack methods of malicious users and developers, i.e., posting fake news and
injecting backdoors. Specifically, we evaluate multi-modal detectors with five
adversarial and two backdoor attack methods. Experiment results imply that: (1)
The detection performance of the state-of-the-art detectors degrades
significantly under adversarial attacks, even worse than general detectors; (2)
Most multi-modal detectors are more vulnerable when subjected to attacks on
visual modality than textual modality; (3) Popular events' images will cause
significant degradation to the detectors when they are subjected to backdoor

worse than under uni-modal attacks; (5) Defensive methods will improve the

based weighting schemes have shown superiority in ensuring either the
discriminability or faithfulness of the CAM, but they normally cannot excel in
both properties. In this paper, we propose a novel CAM weighting scheme, named
FD-CAM, to improve both the faithfulness and discriminability of the CAM-based
CNN visual explanation. First, we improve the faithfulness and discriminability
of the score-based weights by performing a grouped channel switching operation.
Specifically, for each channel, we compute its similarity group and switch the
group of channels on or off simultaneously to compute changes in the class
prediction score as the weights. Then, we combine the improved score-based
weights with the conventional gradient-based weights so that the
discriminability of the final CAM can be further improved. We perform extensive
comparisons with the state-of-the-art CAM algorithms. The quantitative and
qualitative results show our FD-CAM can produce more faithful and more
discriminative visual explanations of the CNNs. We also conduct experiments to
verify the effectiveness of the proposed grouped channel switching and weight
combination scheme on improving the results. Our code is available at

$R_2^*$ mapping with resolved water-fat ambiguity to calculate field
inhomogeneity (field map) using the phase images.
  THEORY: The estimation is formulated in matrix form, resolving the field map
in a least-squares sense. PDFF and $R_2^*$ from magnitude fitting may be
updated using the estimated field maps.
  METHODS: The limits of quantification of our voxel-independent implementation
were assessed. Bland-Altman was used to compare PDFF and field maps from our
method against a reference complex-based method on 152 UK Biobank subjects (1.5
T Siemens). A separate acquisition (3 T Siemens) presenting field
inhomogeneities was also used.
  RESULTS: The proposed field mapping was accurate beyond double the
complex-based limit range. High agreement was obtained between the proposed
method and the reference in UK Biobank (PDFF bias = -0.03 %, LoA (limits of
agreement) [-0.1,0.1] %; Field map bias = 0.06 Hz, LoA = [-0.2,0.3] Hz). Robust
field mapping was observed at 3 T, for inhomogeneities over 300 Hz including
rapid variation across edges.
  CONCLUSION: Field mapping following magnitude-based water-fat separation with
resolved water-fat ambiguity was demonstrated in-vivo and showed potential at
high field.

Conventionally, soft x-ray PES (SXPS) probes the Ti 2$p$ core level; however,
it is not ideal to fully capture satellite features due to its inherent
spin-orbit-splitting (SOS). Here, hard x-ray PES(HAXPES) provides access to the
Ti 1$s$ spectrum instead, which allows us to study intrinsic charge responses
upon core-hole creation without the complication from SOS and with favorable
intrinsic linewidths. The experimental spectra are theoretically analyzed by
two impurity models, including an Anderson impurity model (AIM) built on local
density approximation (LDA) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), and a
conventional TiO$_6$ cluster model. The theoretical results emphasize the
importance of explicit inclusion of higher-order Ti-O charge-transfer processes
beyond the nearest-neighboring Ti-O bond to simulate the core level spectra of
SrTiO$_3$ and TiO$_2$. The AIM approach with continuous bath orbitals provided
by LDA+DMFT represents the experimental spectra well. Crucially, with the aid

novel method called Open-sampling, which utilizes open-set noisy labels to
re-balance the class priors of the training dataset. For each open-set

complementary to the distribution of original class priors. We empirically show
that Open-sampling not only re-balances the class priors but also encourages
the neural network to learn separable representations. Extensive experiments

revisited due to the need for interpretable models. Still, existing methods
have several shortcomings: 1) most recent methods require a binary feature
matrix as input, while learning rules directly from numeric variables is
understudied; 2) existing methods impose orders among rules, either explicitly

for learning probabilistic rule sets for multi-class target variables (there is
only one for probabilistic rule lists).
  We propose TURS, for Truly Unordered Rule Sets, which addresses these

sets. To resolve conflicts caused by overlapping rules, i.e., instances covered
by multiple rules, we propose a novel approach that exploits the probabilistic
properties of our rule sets. We next develop a two-phase heuristic algorithm
that learns rule sets by carefully growing rules. An important innovation is
that we use a surrogate score to take the global potential of the rule set into
account when learning a local rule.
  Finally, we empirically demonstrate that, compared to non-probabilistic and

evolution of two-planet systems during both the type-II migration phase and
their long-term evolution after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk. We
use the symplectic integrator SyMBA, modified to include a wide binary
companion. We also include the Type-II migration of giant planets during the
disk phase with suitable eccentricity and inclination damping as well as the
disk gravitational potential acting on the planets and the nodal precession of
the disk induced by the binary companion. We consider various inclinations,
eccentricities, and separations of the binary companion. Disk migration allows
the formation of planet pairs in mean-motion resonances (MMR) despite the
presence of the binary companion. When the binary separation is wide (1000au),
the timescale of the perturbations it raises on the planets is longer than the
disk's lifetime and resonant pairs are routinely formed in the 2:1, 5:2 and 3:1
MMR. Provided the planet-planet interaction timescale is smaller than the
binary perturbations timescale, these systems can remain in resonance long
after the disk has dissipated. When the binary separation is smaller (250au),
only planets in the 2:1 resonance tend to remain in a resonant state and more
chaotic evolutions are observed, as well as more ejections. After those
ejections, the remaining planet can become eccentric due to the perturbations
from the binary companion and for strongly inclined binary companions captures
in the von Ziepel-Lidov-Kozai resonance can occur, while in systems with two
planets this mechanism is quenched by planet-planet interactions. Our
simulations reveal that the interplay between planet-disk, planet-planet and
planet-binary interactions can lead to the formation of resonant pairs of
planets which remain stable over timescales much longer than the disk's
lifetime.

for autonomous vehicles that require good understanding of the environmental
context; behavioral decisions are better made by referring to the outputs of
trajectory predictions. However, most current solutions perform these two tasks
separately. Therefore, a joint neural network that combines multiple cues is
proposed and named as the holistic transformer to predict trajectories and make
behavioral decisions simultaneously. To better explore the intrinsic
relationships between cues, the network uses existing knowledge and adopts
three kinds of attention mechanisms: the sparse multi-head type for reducing
noise impact, feature selection sparse type for optimally using partial prior
knowledge, and multi-head with sigmoid activation type for optimally using
posteriori knowledge. Compared with other trajectory prediction models, the
proposed model has better comprehensive performance and good interpretability.
Perceptual noise robustness experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has
good noise robustness. Thus, simultaneous trajectory prediction and behavioral
decision-making combining multiple cues can reduce computational costs and
enhance semantic relationships between scenes and agents.

management of natural resources. They are commonly trained by scientific survey
data but, since surveys are expensive, there is a need for complementary
sources of information to train them. To this end, several authors have
proposed to use expert elicitation since local citizen and substance area
experts can hold valuable information on species distributions. Expert
knowledge has been incorporated within SDMs, for example, through informative
priors. However, existing approaches pose challenges related to assessment of
the reliability of the experts. Since expert knowledge is inherently subjective
and prone to biases, we should optimally calibrate experts' assessments and
make inference on their reliability. Moreover, demonstrated examples of
improved species distribution predictions using expert elicitation compared to
using only survey data are few as well. In this work, we propose a novel
approach to use expert knowledge on species distribution within SDMs and
demonstrate that it leads to significantly better predictions. First, we
propose expert elicitation process where experts summarize their belief on a
species occurrence proability with maps. Second, we collect survey data to
calibrate the expert assessments. Third, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian
model that combines the two information sources and can be used to make
predictions over the study area. We apply our methods to study the distribution
of spring spawning pikeperch larvae in a coastal area of the Gulf of Finland.
According to our results, the expert information significantly improves species
distribution predictions compared to predictions conditioned on survey data
only. However, experts' reliability also varies considerably, and even
generally reliable experts had spatially structured biases in their
assessments.

prosperity of the Internet of Value and Metaverse. However, no solid evidence
stipulates the exact definition, criterion, or standard in the sense of such a

down the connotation of Web3 by separating it from high-level controversy
argues and, instead, focusing on its protocol, architecture, and evaluation
from the perspective of blockchain fields. Specifically, we have identified all
potential architectural design types and evaluated each of them by employing
the scenario-based architecture evaluation method. The evaluation shows that
existing applications are neither secure nor adoptable as claimed. Meanwhile,
we also discuss opportunities and challenges surrounding the Web3 space and
answer several prevailing questions from communities. A primary result is that
Web3 still relies on traditional internet infrastructure, not as independent as
advocated. This report, as of June 2022, provides the first strict research on
Web3 in the view of blockchain. We hope that this work would provide a guide
for the development of future Web3 services.

text-based representations of word meanings by leveraging perceptual knowledge
from vision. Despite many attempts at language grounding, it is still unclear
how to effectively inject visual knowledge into the word embeddings of a
language in such a way that a proper balance of textual and visual knowledge is
maintained. Some common concerns are the following. Is visual grounding
beneficial for abstract words or is its contribution only limited to concrete
words? What is the optimal way of bridging the gap between text and vision? How
much do we gain by visually grounding textual embeddings? The present study
addresses these questions by proposing a simple yet very effective grounding
approach for pre-trained word embeddings. Our model aligns textual embeddings
with vision while largely preserving the distributional statistics that
characterize word use in text corpora. By applying a learned alignment, we are
able to generate visually grounded embeddings for unseen words, including
abstract words. A series of evaluations on word similarity benchmarks shows
that visual grounding is beneficial not only for concrete words, but also for
abstract words. We also show that our method for visual grounding offers
advantages for contextualized embeddings, but only when these are trained on
corpora of relatively modest size. Code and grounded embeddings for English are

conducive to (i) the high-precision reproduction and reinterpretation of core
experimental observations on neural coding in the self-organizing brain, with
the instantaneous geometric dimensionality of neural representations of a
spontaneous behavioral state being proven to be at most 16, unidirectionally;
(ii) the coexistability of ordinary and dark neural coding for (co-)behavior;
(iii) a possible role for spinor (co-)representations, as the latent building

develop a novel multimodal deep learning framework to aid medical professionals

that we use cross-modal attention, which captures interactions between
modalities - a method not previously explored in this domain. We perform
multi-class classification, a challenging task considering the strong
similarities between MCI and AD. We compare with previous state-of-the-art
models, evaluate the importance of attention, and examine the contribution of
each modality to the model's performance. MADDi classifies MCI, AD, and
controls with 96.88% accuracy on a held-out test set. When examining the
contribution of different attention schemes, we found that the combination of
cross-modal attention with self-attention performed the best, and no attention
layers in the model performed the worst, with a 7.9% difference in F1-Scores.
Our experiments underlined the importance of structured clinical data to help
machine learning models contextualize and interpret the remaining modalities.
Extensive ablation studies showed that any multimodal mixture of input features
without access to structured clinical information suffered marked performance
losses. This study demonstrates the merit of combining multiple input
modalities via cross-modal attention to deliver highly accurate AD diagnostic
decision support.

quantum computation and communication with continuous variables. The creation
of such states relies on strong nonlinear light-matter interactions, which are
widely available in microwave frequencies as in circuit quantum electrodynamics
platforms. However, strong nonlinearities are hard to come by in optical
frequencies, severely limiting the use of continuous variable quantum
information in the optical range. Here we propose using the strong interactions
of free electrons with light as a source for optical cat and GKP states. The
strong interactions can be realized by phase-matching of free electrons with
photonic structures such as optical waveguides and photonic crystals. Our
approach enables the generation of optical GKP states with above 10 dB
squeezing and fidelities above 90% at post-selection probability of 10%, even
reaching >30% using an initially squeezed vacuum state. Furthermore, the
free-electron interaction allows for conditional rotations on the photonic
state, enabling to entangle a pair of GKP states into a GKP Bell state. Since
electrons can interact resonantly with light across the electromagnetic
spectrum, our approach may be used for the generation of cat and GKP states
over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio-waves to X-rays.

convergence. Still, they suffer from two main issues, namely: low communication
efficiency and low privacy due to the requirement of sending Hessian
information from clients to parameter server (PS). In this work, we introduced
a novel framework called FedNew in which there is no need to transmit Hessian
information from clients to PS, hence resolving the bottleneck to improve
communication efficiency. In addition, FedNew hides the gradient information
and results in a privacy-preserving approach compared to the existing
state-of-the-art. The core novel idea in FedNew is to introduce a two level
framework, and alternate between updating the inverse Hessian-gradient product
using only one alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) step and then
performing the global model update using Newton's method. Though only one ADMM
pass is used to approximate the inverse Hessian-gradient product at each
iteration, we develop a novel theoretical approach to show the converging
behavior of FedNew for convex problems. Additionally, a significant reduction
in communication overhead is achieved by utilizing stochastic quantization.
Numerical results using real datasets show the superiority of FedNew compared
to existing methods in terms of communication costs.

successfully converges to the desired trajectory, and PINN executes good

fluctuation for higher-order terms. For some various nonlinearities, PINN
failed to implement the desired trajectory instead of becoming ""trapped"" in the
phase of a small radius, yet FB successfully implemented controls. PINN
generally exhibits lower relative errors for varying targeted trajectories.
However, PINN also shows evidently higher computational burden compared with
traditional control theory methods, with at least more than 30 times longer

discrimination of different classes, they can often suffer from poor
calibration across challenging domains including healthcare. Moreover, the
long-tail distribution poses great challenges in deep learning classification
problems including clinical disease prediction. There are approaches proposed
recently to calibrate deep prediction in computer vision, but there are no
studies found to demonstrate how the representative models work in different
challenging contexts. In this paper, we bridge the confidence calibration from
computer vision to medical imaging with a comparative study of four high-impact
calibration models. Our studies are conducted in different contexts (natural
image classification and lung cancer risk estimation) including in balanced vs.
imbalanced training sets and in computer vision vs. medical imaging. Our
results support key findings: (1) We achieve new conclusions which are not
studied under different learning contexts, e.g., combining two calibration
models that both mitigate the overconfident prediction can lead to
under-confident prediction, and simpler calibration models from the computer
vision domain tend to be more generalizable to medical imaging. (2) We
highlight the gap between general computer vision tasks and medical imaging
prediction, e.g., calibration methods ideal for general computer vision tasks

Although high energy physics has been the main driving force for the
development of the particle accelerators, accelerator facilities have
continually been expanding applications in many areas of research and
technology. For instance, active areas of accelerator applications include
radiotherapy to treat cancer, production of short-lived medical isotopes,
synchrotron light sources, free-electron lasers, beam lithography for
microcircuits, thin-film technology and radiation processing of food.
Currently, the largest and most powerful accelerator is the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at CERN, which accelerates protons to multi-TeV energies in a 27
km high-vacuum ring. To go beyond the maximum capabilities of the LHC, the next
generation of circular and linear particle colliders under consideration, based
on radiofrequency acceleration, will require multi-billion investment,
kilometric infrastructure and a massive power consumption. These factors pose
serious challenges in an increasingly resource-limited world. Therefore, it is
important to look for alternative and sustainable acceleration techniques. This
review article pays special attention to novel accelerator techniques to
overcome present acceleration limitations towards more compact and

plasmonics accessible. Since plasmons correspond to collective electron
excitations, the electron-electron interaction plays an essential role in their
theoretical description. Within the Random Phase Approximation, this
interaction is incorporated through a system of equations of motion, which has
to be solved self-consistently. For homogeneous media, an analytical solution
can be found using the Fourier transform, giving rise to Lindhard theory. When
the medium is spatially inhomogeneous, this is no longer possible and one often
uses numerical approaches, which are however limited to smaller systems. In
this paper, we present a novel semi-analytical approach for bulk plasmons in
inhomogeneous media based on the semiclassical (or WKB) approximation, which is
applicable when the charge density varies smoothly. By solving the equations of
motion self-consistently, we obtain the expressions of Lindhard theory with a
spatially varying Fermi wavevector. The derivation involves passing from the
operators to their symbols, which can be thought of as classical observables on
phase space. In this way we obtain effective (Hamiltonian) equations of motion
for plasmons. We then find the quantized energy levels and the plasmon spectrum
using Einstein-Brilllouin-Keller quantization. Our results provide a
theoretical basis to describe different setups in quantum plasmonics, such as
nanoparticles, quantum dots and waveguides.

space, whereas the snapshots in ABQMC alternate between real and reciprocal
space. The methods may be applied to study equilibrium properties within
grand-canonical or canonical ensemble, external field quenches, and even the
evolution of pure states. Various real-space/reciprocal-space correlation
functions are also within their reach. Both methods deal with matrices of size
equal to the number of particles (thus independent of the number of orbitals or
time slices), which allows for cheap updates. We benchmark the methods in
relevant setups. In equilibrium, the FPQMC method is found to have excellent
average sign and, in some cases, yields correct results even with poor
imaginary-time discretization. ABQMC has significantly worse average sign, but
also produces good results. Out of equilibrium, FPQMC suffers from a strong

into most mainstream programming languages. Many researchers and developers
consider that these constructs lead to programs that are more concise,
reusable, and easier to understand. However, few studies investigate the
implications of using them in mainstream programming languages. This paper
quantifies the prevalence of four concepts typically associated with functional
programming in JavaScript: recursion, immutability, lazy evaluation, and
functions as values. We focus on JavaScript programs due to the availability of
some of these concepts in the language since its inception, its inspiration
from functional programming languages, and its popularity. We mine 91 GitHub
repositories (22+ million LOC) written mostly in JavaScript (over 50% of the
code), measuring the usage of these concepts from both static and temporal
perspectives. We also measure the likelihood of bug-fixing commits removing
uses of these concepts (which would hint at bug-proneness) and their
association with the presence of code comments (which would hint at code that
is hard to understand). We find that these concepts are in widespread use (1
for every 46.65 LOC, 43.59% of LOC). In addition, the usage of higher-order
functions, immutability, and lazy evaluation-related structures has been
growing throughout the years for the analyzed projects, while the usage of
recursion and callbacks & promises has decreased. We also find statistical
evidence that removing these structures, with the exception of the ones
associated to immutability, is less common in bug-fixing commits than in other
commits. In addition, their presence is not correlated with comment size. Our
findings suggest that functional programming concepts are important for
developers using a multi-paradigm language, and their usage does not make
programs harder to understand.

memory occupation, latency, and energy consumption of deep neural networks. In
particular, mixed-precision quantization, i.e., the use of different bit-widths
for different portions of the network, has been shown to provide excellent
efficiency gains with limited accuracy drops, especially with optimized
bit-width assignments determined by automated Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
tools. State-of-the-art mixed-precision works layer-wise, i.e., it uses
different bit-widths for the weights and activations tensors of each network
layer. In this work, we widen the search space, proposing a novel NAS that
selects the bit-width of each weight tensor channel independently. This gives
the tool the additional flexibility of assigning a higher precision only to the
weights associated with the most informative features. Testing on the MLPerf
Tiny benchmark suite, we obtain a rich collection of Pareto-optimal models in
the accuracy vs model size and accuracy vs energy spaces. When deployed on the
MPIC RISC-V edge processor, our networks reduce the memory and energy for
inference by up to 63% and 27% respectively compared to a layer-wise approach,
for the same accuracy.

generalize across a wide spectrum of tasks and capabilities. Inspired by how
humans continually learn and adapt in the open world, we advocate a trinity of

MineDojo, a new framework built on the popular Minecraft game that features a
simulation suite with thousands of diverse open-ended tasks and an
internet-scale knowledge base with Minecraft videos, tutorials, wiki pages, and

algorithm that leverages large pre-trained video-language models as a learned

the payload and shortens the flight time, we propose to install only one camera
on the leader drone. The follower drones receive the commands from the leader
UAV and maintain a collision-free trajectory with the artificial potential
field. The experimental results revealed a high accuracy of the swarm landing
on a static mobile platform (RMSE of 4.48 cm). RMSE of swarm landing on the
mobile platform moving with the maximum velocities of 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s
equals 8.76 cm and 8.98 cm, respectively. The proposed SwarmHive technology
will allow the time-saving landing of the swarm for further drone recharging.
This will make it possible to achieve self-sustainable operation of a
multi-agent robotic system for such scenarios as rescue operations, inspection

largest persistence probability. The model is integer fractional programming,
but it can be reduced to mixed-integer linear programming with an appropriate
variable substitution. Nevertheless, the problem can be solved in a reasonable
time for networks of small size only, therefore we developed some heuristic
procedures to approximate the optimal solution. First, we elaborated a
randomized greedy-ascent method, taking advantage of a peculiar data structure
to generate feasible solutions fast. After analyzing the greedy output and
determining where the optimal solution is eventually located, we implemented
improving procedures based on a local exchange, but applying different long

reproduce accurately the clustering characteristics found in real networks to

of cascade undergoes continuous transition as the Mach number Ma increases,
from inverse at zero Ma, to direct at infinite Ma. Thus, at Ma of order one
comparable amounts of energy flow from the scale of the pumping to large and
small scales, in accord with previous data. For supersonic turbulence with
large Ma, the cascade is direct, as in three dimensions, which results in
multifractal density field. For compressible flows of conducting fluids,
imposing external magnetic field allows to manipulate the flow producing
possibly large changes even at small Mach number. Thus Zeldovich antidynamo
theorem, by which at zero Ma the magnetic field is zero in the steady state,
must be used with caution. Real flows have finite Ma and, however small it is,
for large magnetic flux through the disk, the magnetic field changes the flow
appreciably, or rearranges it completely. For large Ma, relevant for
astrophysical disks, the magnetic field energy is enhanced by a large factor as
compared to estimates based on the mean field. We propose to use
two-dimensional Burgers turbulence, whose three-dimensional counterpart is used
for studies of the large-scale structure of the Universe, as a model for

and studied in this work. For this purpose, a system of fermions on a lattice
is considered and one applies the scheme to replace the fermionic variables
with spin matrices, while the transformation relates only those fermionic/spin
operators which are assigned to nearby lattice sites. In one dimension, this
proposal yields the same result as the well-known Jordan-Wigner transformation,
while not being restricted to $d=1$ dimension. To obtain the equivalent
description in the spin picture, one needs to impose constraints on the spin
space. Since finding the reduced spin Hilbert space constitutes a substantial
stage of the whole procedure, the constraints are paid particular attention.
The full set of necessary constraints is determined in both representations. To
approach the task to solve the constraints, a suitable basis is constructed.
The introduction of the basis in the spin representation along with the
construction of the constraints and the Hamiltonian in this basis show how the
transformation proposed in this work can be applied to obtain observables in
the spin picture. Explicit construction of the constraints in the basis allows
one to solve them and, once the basis vectors of the reduced spin Hilbert space
are found, the spin Hamiltonian is expressed in this basis and diagonalized.
The constraints are constructed in the basis as discussed above and analyzed
with the Wolfram Mathematica programs for lattice sizes $3\times3$, $4\times3$
and $4\times4$. Their mutual relations are determined and the reduced spin
Hilbert space is specified. The Hamiltonian is constructed in this
representation and diagonalized. It is verified that the eigenenergies obtained
in the spin picture agree with the analytic formulas from the fermionic
representation.

  Procaccia","Welfare-Maximizing Pooled Testing",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In an epidemic, how should an organization with limited testing resources
safely return to in-person activities after a period of lockdown? We study this
question in a setting where the population at hand is heterogeneous in both
utility for in-person activities and probability of infection. In such a period
of re-integration, tests can be used as a certificate of non-infection, whereby
those in negative tests are permitted to return to in-person activities for a
designated amount of time. Under the assumption that samples can be pooled, the
question of how to allocate the limited testing budget to the population in
such a way as to maximize the utility of individuals in negative tests (who
subsequently return to in-person activities) is non-trivial, with a large space
of potential testing allocations. We show that non-overlapping testing
allocations, which are both conceptually and (crucially) logistically more
simple to implement, are approximately optimal, and we design an efficient
greedy algorithm for finding non-overlapping testing allocations with
approximately optimal welfare (overall utility). We also provide empirical
evidence in support of the efficacy of our approach.

sought a data efficient approach to resting state fMRI classification of autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) versus neurotypical (NT) controls. We hypothesized that
a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) classifier could learn effectively on a
small fMRI training set.
  Methods : We trained a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) classifier on 100
graph-label pairs from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database.
For comparison, we trained a Supervised Deep Learning (SDL) classifier on the
same training set.
  Results : DRL significantly outperformed SDL, with a p-value of 2.4 x
10^(-7). DRL achieved superior results for a variety of classifier performance
metrics, including an F1 score of 76, versus 67 for SDL. Whereas SDL quickly
overfit the training data, DRL learned in a progressive manner that generalised
to the separate testing set.
  Conclusion : DRL can learn to classify ASD versus NT in a data efficient
manner, doing so for a small training set. Future work will involve optimizing
the neural network for data efficiency and applying the approach to other fMRI
data sets, namely for brain cancer patients.

errors such as machine failure and human error have also been considered more
over the past. Since machines and humans are not error-proof, managing the

There are numerous methods for investigating human errors, fatigue, and
reliability that categorized under Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) methods.
HRA methods use some qualitative factors named Performance Shaping Factors
(PSFs) to estimate Human Error Probability (HEP). Since the PSFs can be
considered as the acceleration factors in Accelerated Life Test (ALT). We
developed a method for Accelerated Human Fatigue Test (AHFT) to calculate human
fatigue, according to fatigue rate and other effective factors. The proposed
method reduces the time and cost of human fatigue calculation. AHFT first
extracts the important factors affecting human fatigue using Principal

``multi-frequency'' structure by closely examining its maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) formulation, whereas existing methods are not originated from
this perspective. To this end, two simple yet efficient algorithms that
leverage the MLE formulation and benefit from the information across multiple

multi-frequency column-pivoted QR factorization. The factorization applied to
the top eigenvectors of the observation matrix provides key information about
the cluster structure and associated phase angles. The second approach is an
iterative multi-frequency generalized power method, where each iteration
updates the estimation in a matrix-multiplication-then-projection manner.

existential risk from misaligned artificial intelligence. I proceed in two
stages. First, I lay out a backdrop picture that informs such concern. On this
picture, intelligent agency is an extremely powerful force, and creating agents
much more intelligent than us is playing with fire -- especially given that if
their objectives are problematic, such agents would plausibly have instrumental
incentives to seek power over humans. Second, I formulate and evaluate a more
specific six-premise argument that creating agents of this kind will lead to
existential catastrophe by 2070. On this argument, by 2070: (1) it will become
possible and financially feasible to build relevantly powerful and agentic AI
systems; (2) there will be strong incentives to do so; (3) it will be much
harder to build aligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems than to
build misaligned (and relevantly powerful/agentic) AI systems that are still
superficially attractive to deploy; (4) some such misaligned systems will seek
power over humans in high-impact ways; (5) this problem will scale to the full
disempowerment of humanity; and (6) such disempowerment will constitute an
existential catastrophe. I assign rough subjective credences to the premises in
this argument, and I end up with an overall estimate of ~5% that an existential
catastrophe of this kind will occur by 2070. (May 2022 update: since making

have been published (e.g., highD, NGSim, and pNEUMA). These datasets have been
used in studies that investigate variability in human driving behavior, for
example for scenario-based validation of autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior,
modeling driver behavior, or validating driver models. Thus far, these studies
focused on the variability on an operational level (e.g., velocity profiles
during a lane change), not on a tactical level (i.e., to change lanes or not).
Investigating the variability on both levels is necessary to develop driver
models and AVs that include multiple tactical behaviors. To expose multi-level
variability, the human responses to the same traffic scene could be
investigated. However, no method exists to automatically extract similar scenes
from datasets. Here, we present a four-step extraction method that uses the
Hausdorff distance, a mathematical distance metric for sets. We performed a
case study on the highD dataset that showed that the method is practically
applicable. The human responses to the selected scenes exposed the variability
on both the tactical and operational levels. With this new method, the
variability in operational and tactical human behavior can be investigated,
without the need for costly and time-consuming driving-simulator experiments.

hydrodynamic interaction (HI) and external drive can be critical for many
applications. By harvesting advanced deep learning techniques, the present work
introduces a new framework, hydrodynamic interaction graph neural network
(HIGNN), for inferring and predicting the particles' dynamics in Stokes
suspensions. It overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches in
computational efficiency, accuracy, and/or transferability. In particular, by
uniting the data structure represented by a graph and the neural networks with
learnable parameters, the HIGNN constructs surrogate modeling for the mobility
tensor of particles which is the key to predicting the dynamics of particles
subject to HI and external forces. To account for the many-body nature of HI,
we generalize the state-of-the-art GNN by introducing higher-order connectivity
into the graph and the corresponding convolutional operation. For training the
HIGNN, we only need the data for a small number of particles in the domain of
interest, and hence the training cost can be maintained low. Once constructed,
the HIGNN permits fast predictions of the particles' velocities and is
transferable to suspensions of different numbers/concentrations of particles in
the same domain and to any external forcing. It has the ability to accurately
capture both the long-range HI and short-range lubrication effects. We
demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and transferability of the proposed HIGNN
framework in a variety of systems. The requirement on computing resource is
minimum: most simulations only require a desktop with one GPU; the simulations
for a large suspension of 100,000 particles call for up to 6 GPUs.

in measuring polling errors has increased. The most common method for measuring
directional errors and non-sampling excess variability during a postmortem for
an election is by assessing the difference between the poll result and election
result for polls conducted within a few days of the day of the election.
Analyzing such polling error data is notoriously difficult with typical models
being extremely sensitive to the time between the poll and the election. We
leverage hidden Markov models traditionally used for election forecasting to
flexibly capture time-varying preferences and treat the election result as a
peak at the typically hidden Markovian process. Our results are much less
sensitive to the choice of time window, avoid conflating shifting preferences
with polling error, and are more interpretable despite a highly flexible model.
We demonstrate these results with data on polls from the 2004 through 2020 US
Presidential elections and 1992 through 2020 US Senate elections, concluding
that previously reported estimates of bias in Presidential elections were too
extreme by 10\%, estimated bias in Senatorial elections was too extreme by

on the methodological level regarding the determination of these half-lives.
This manifests by a divergent methodology and the existence of two main, but
contradictory concepts. In the first, empirically determined half-life is
referred to as environmental or biological. The effective half-life is
extrapolated at a later stage after taking into account the physical decay. In
the second concept, the effective half-life is the one empirically determined

decay. As both concepts seems to be incompatible with each other, the aim of

quantify Ohmic and non-Ohmic resistive losses in solar cells is based on the
comparison between the voltage in the dark and under illumination analysed at
equal recombination current density. Applied to perovskite solar cells, we
observe a combination of an Ohmic series resistance with a voltage-dependent
resistance that is most prominent at short circuit and low forward bias. The
latter is most likely caused by the poor transport properties of the electron
and/or hole transport layers. By measuring the photoluminescence of perovskite
solar cells as a function of applied voltage, we provide direct evidence for a
high quasi-Fermi level splitting at low and moderate forward bias that
substantially exceeds the externally applied voltage. This quasi-Fermi level
splitting causes recombination losses and, thus, reduces both the short-circuit
current and the fill factor of the solar cell.

controlled during egg incubation. Improper temperature and humidity levels
during the incubation period often result in unwanted conditions. This paper
proposes the design of an efficient Mamdani fuzzy interference system instead
of the widely used Takagi-Sugeno system in this field for controlling the
temperature and humidity levels of an egg incubator. Though the optimum
incubation temperature and humidity levels used here are that of chicken egg,
the proposed methodology is applicable to other avian species as well. Theinput
functions have been used here as per estimated values forsafe hatching using
Mamdani whereas defuzzification method, COA, has been applied for output. From
the model output,a stabilized heat from temperature level and fan speed to
control the humidity level of an egg incubator can be obtained. This maximizes
the hatching rate of healthy chicks under any conditions in the field.

improvement of existing models, with the aim of increasing the performance of
neural networks for the solution of a variety of different tasks. However, such
advancements often come at the cost of an increase of model memory and
computational requirements. This represents a significant limitation for the
deployability of research output in realistic settings, where the cost, the
energy consumption, and the complexity of the framework play a crucial role. To
solve this issue, the designer should search for models that maximise the
performance while limiting its footprint. Typical approaches to reach this goal
rely either on manual procedures, which cannot guarantee the optimality of the
final design, or upon Neural Architecture Search algorithms to automatise the
process, at the expenses of extremely high computational time. This paper
provides a solution for the fast identification of a neural network that
maximises the model accuracy while preserving size and computational
constraints typical of tiny devices. Our approach, named FreeREA, is a custom
cell-based evolution NAS algorithm that exploits an optimised combination of
training-free metrics to rank architectures during the search, thus without
need of model training. Our experiments, carried out on the common benchmarks
NAS-Bench-101 and NATS-Bench, demonstrate that i) FreeREA is a fast, efficient,
and effective search method for models automatic design; ii) it outperforms
State of the Art training-based and training-free techniques in all the
datasets and benchmarks considered, and iii) it can easily generalise to
constrained scenarios, representing a competitive solution for fast Neural
Architecture Search in generic constrained applications. The code is available

driven by the global trend for the electrification of transportation.
Understanding the dynamics of lithium metal electrodeposition is crucial to
design safe and reliable lithium metal anodes. In this study, we developed a
grand potential-based phase-field model to investigate the effect of a static
gas bubble, which forms due to the complicated internal side reactions, on the
dynamics of the dendrite growth during electrodeposition. It is observed that
with the presence of a gas bubble, the dendrite growth is largely accelerated,
due to the accumulation of lithium ions on the far side of the bubble away from
the anode surface, which could serve as an ion ""reservoir"" for the dendrite
growth, leading to the bending/tilting of the lithium dendrites toward the
bubble. Meanwhile, the effects of the bubble size and distance to the anode are
further studied, demonstrating that the larger the bubble size and the closer
to the anode, the longer the lithium dendrites grow. We hope this study could
serve as an example to exploit the effect of extrinsic factors on the dendrite
growth dynamics.

electrochemical properties of earth-abundant and tunable Zn1-xSn1+xN2 (x = -0.4
to x = 0.4) thin films, which show high electrical conductivity and high
gravimetric capacity for Li insertion. Enhanced cycling performance is achieved
compared to previously published end-members Zn3N2 and Sn3N4, showing decreased
irreversible loss and increased total capacity and cycle stability. The average
reversible capacity observed is > 1050 mAh/g for all compositions and 1220
mAh/g for Zn-poor (x = 0.2) films. Extremely Zn-rich films (x = -0.4) show
improved adhesion; however, Zn-rich films undergo a phase transformation on the
first cycle. Zn-poor and stoichiometric films do not exhibit significant phase
transformations which often plague nitride materials and show no required
overpotential at the 0.5 V plateau. Cation composition x is explored as a
mechanism for tuning relevant mechanical and electrochemical properties, such
as capacity, overpotential, phase transformation, electrical conductivity, and
adhesion. The lithiation/delithiation experiments confirm the reversible
electrochemical reactions. Without any binding additives, the as-deposited
electrodes delaminate resulting in fast capacity degradation. We demonstrate
the mechanical nature of this degradation through decreased electrode thinning,
resulting in cells with improved cycling stability due to increased mechanical
stability. Combining composition and electrochemical analysis, this work
demonstrates for the first time composition dependent electrochemical
properties for the ternary Zn1-xSn1+xN2 and proposes earth-abundant ternary

systems such as tumor growth, tissue spreading, wound healing, and biofilm
formation. Analysis of such biological systems, in principle, includes
examining the interplay of cell-cell interactions together with the cell-matrix
interaction. These two interaction types mainly drive the dynamics of cellular
aggregates which is intrinsically out of equilibrium. Here we propose a
non-linear continuum mechanics formulation and the corresponding finite element
simulation framework to model the physics of cellular aggregate formation. As
an example, we focus in particular on the process of bacterial colony formation
as recently studied by Kuan et al. Thereby we describe the aggregation process
as an active phase separation phenomenon. We develop a Lagrangian continuum
description of the problem which yields a substantial simplification to the
formulations of the governing equations. Due to the presence of spatial Hessian
and Laplacian operators, a gradient-enhanced approach is required to
incorporate C1 continuity. In addition, a robust and efficient finite element
formulation of the problem is provided. Taylor-Hood finite elements are
utilized for the implementation to avoid instabilities related to the LBB
condition. Finally, through a set of numerical examples, the influence of
various parameters on the dynamics of the cellular aggregate formation is
investigated. Our proposed methodology furnishes a general framework for the
investigation of the rheology and non-equilibrium dynamics of cellular
aggregates.

topography affect diverse processes, including bedform development and channel
migration. Predicting how these interactions affect the spatial patterns and
magnitudes of bed deformation in meandering rivers is essential for various
river engineering and geoscience problems. Computational fluid dynamics
simulations can predict river morphodynamics at fine temporal and spatial
scales but have traditionally been challenged by the large scale of natural
rivers. We conducted coupled large-eddy simulation (LES) and bed morphodynamics
simulations to create a unique database of hydro-morphodynamic datasets for 42
meandering rivers with a variety of planform shapes and large-scale geometrical
features that mimic natural meanders. For each simulated river, the database
includes (i) bed morphology, (ii) three-dimensional mean velocity field, and
(iii) bed shear stress distribution under bankfull flow conditions. The
calculated morphodynamics results at dynamic equilibrium revealed the formation
of scour and deposition patterns near the outer and inner banks, respectively,
while the location of point bars and scour regions around the apexes of the
meander bends is found to vary as a function of the radius of curvature of the
bends to the width ratio. A new mechanism is proposed that explains this
seemingly paradoxical finding. The high-fidelity simulation results generated
in this work provide researchers and scientists with a rich numerical database
for morphodynamics and bed shear stress distributions in large-scale meandering
rivers to enable systematic investigation of the underlying phenomena and
support a range of river engineering applications.

covert the simulated fBm series to a PCD, a subset of unit $D$-dimensional

compute topological measures for embedded PCD as a function of associated Hurst

for a regular synthetic fBm, the higher value of the embedding dimension leads
to increasing the $H$-dependency of topological measures based on zeroth and
first homology groups. To achieve a reliable classification of fBm, we should
consider the small value of time-delay irrespective of the irregularity
presented in the data. More interestingly, the value of scale for which the PCD
